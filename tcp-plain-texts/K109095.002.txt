 Dorastus  and  Fawnia  _BEFORE Christianity appeared in the World there reigned in  Bohemia  a King named  Pandosto  who was married to a Princess of exquisite Beauty and consummate Virtue called  Bellaria  The Harmony that subsisted between this royal Couple gave the greatest Satisfaction to all their Subjects whose Happiness was greatly increased by the Felicity of their Sovereigns  At the End of the first Year of their Marriage  Bellaria  was delivered of a Son who was named  Garrinter  The  Bohemians  upon  this Occasion made great Rejoicings over all the Kingdom And the King as well to express his own Satisfaction at this happy Incident as to comply with the Desires of the People appointed Justs and Tournaments in Honour of the young Prince to which not only many foreign Noblemen resorted but also several neighbouring Kings and Princes came to exercise their Valour and Judgment at these martial Entertainments  The Sports lasted twenty Days during which Time the King made a general Feast for all his Subjects and the Kings and Princes who had been royally entertained returned home to their respective Countries full of Admiration of the great Magnificence of  Pandosto  The Smiles of Fortune are seldom sincere or lasting the fickle Goddess weary of bestowing Favours upon  Pandosto  while he was wholly taken up in the Enjoyment of them prepared a sad reverse of Fate for him and the lovely  Bellaria Pandosto  from his earliest Youth had contracted and maintained a strict Friendship and Correspondence with  Egistus  the young King of  Sicily  This Prince being desirous of shewing that neither Time nor Distance of Place could weaken the Force of his Affection for  Pandosto  resolved to visit him in his own Dominions to congratulate him upon his Marriage and the Birth of a Son For this Purpose he ordered a small Fleet to be prepared and with  a small but select Number of Attendants arrived in  Bohemia  Pandosto  and his Queen with a numerous Retinue went to meet  Egistus  at his landing and carried him to the Palace in the midst of most expensive Shows and magnificent Arches which had been prepared and erected for his Reception  Pandosto  whose Heart overflowed with grateful Transport for this Demonstration of Friendship in  Egistus  intreated his Queen to shew all imaginable Respect and Esteem to a Prince whom he loved so much and to whom he was so highly obliged  The sweet  Bellaria  who had no other Will but that of her Husband was easily prevailed upon to comply with a Request to which her own Inclinations naturally incited her for the noble Qualities she observed in  Egistus  had already produced suitable Effects in a Mind that being virtuous and sensible to the highest Degree itself could not chuse but love those Perfections in another  Bellaria  therefore as well in Obedience to her Husband's Commands as in Consequence of the Friendship she had conceived for  Egistus  gave him every Day a thousand innocent Marks of her Esteem which that Prince who admired and loved her Perfections with all the Warmth of a disinterested Friend did not fail to return with every Instance of Gratitude and Respect  This mutual Esteem gave rise to an easy Confidence and familiar Intercourse between them so that  Pandosto  being often engaged with his Ministers in Affairs of State  Bellaria  and  Egistus  passed away the Time in his Absence in various Discourses and innocent Amusements all which at first was very pleasing to  Pandosto  But that unhappy Prince either because he was conscious of the superior Merit of  Egistus  or through the natural Bent of his Disposition began to look with suspicious Eyes on a Friendship and Familiarity which he had been so solicitous to form Doubtful and uneasy Thoughts arose in his Mind he reflected on the irressistable Charms of  Bellaria  and the manly Beauty and noble Qualities of  Egistus  and thought it impossible that two Persons so formed to please should be insensible to each others Merit  These Doubts having entered his Mind he fed his growing Jealousy with continual Observations on the Looks and Words of his Friend and Wife and prejudiced as he now was their innocent Familiarity appeared to him to be a convincing Proof of their guilty Passion Suspicion was now changed to absolute Certainty he no longer looked upon  Egistus  as his Friend and Guest but as the Destroyer of his Honour and the Violater of his Queen  A violent Hatred succeeded the tender Affection he once bore to  Egistus  and those Smiles of Love with which he had always  been accustomed to behold the charming  Bellaria  gave Place to sullen Reserve and gloomy Frowns Racked with the tormenting Remembrance of his fancied Wrongs the Desire and Hope of Revenge afforded him some Intervals of Ease  He resolved therefore to poison  Egistus  and while his Mind was labouring how to execute his cruel Purpose with Security his Words and Behaviour still wore an Appearance of Friendship and Respect  Pandosto  had a Cupbearer named  Franion  whom because he had always shewn an inviolable Attachment to his Person he believed it would be easy to persuade to execute his purposed Vengeance on the King of  Sicily  To this Man therefore the jealous Monarch communicated his ungenerous Design and promised him a large Reward if when the next Time that  Egistus  called for Drink at his Table he would put Poison in his Cup  Franion  shuddered with Horror at this inhuman Proposition and with all the Freedom of a good Man and a faithful Subject he endeavoured to dissuade his King from his barbarous Purpose He represented to him that Murder was an unpardonable Offence to the Gods and abhorred by all Mankind that such unnatural Crimes not only drew down the Wrath of Heaven upon the Perpetrators of them but the Revenge of Men He urged to him the sacred Laws of Hospitality  that  Egistus  was his Guest his Friend and Ally that any Cruelty committed upon his Person would brand his Name with perpetual Infamy and sow the lasting Seeds of Discord and Hatred between the  Sicilians  and  Bohemians  and that even his own Subjects would murmur at such an unexampled Piece of Cruelty and Treachery  These Arguments had no Force with the determined  Pandosto  who persisting still in his cruel Resolution gave  Franion  his Choice either to poison  Egistus  and be rewarded with Riches and Honours or to suffer Death for his Disobedience  Franion  staggered by these dreadful Threatnings on one Hand and allured by those great Promises on the other told  Pandosto  that he would obey him and as soon as a fair Opportunity offered he would poison  Egistus  The King was very well pleased with this Promise and resolved as soon as his designed Vengeance on  Egistus  was executed to sacrifice  Bellaria  in the same Manner to his abused Love and injured Honour  When the King was departed  Franion  having no longer that dreadful Object before his Eyes threatening Death and Torments if he did not murder the innocent Prince began to reflect seriously upon the horrid Deed he had engaged to perform Murder he thought however secretly and securely committed might for a Time avoid Danger but never wholly escape Punishment that no Balm no Lenitive  could heal the Stings of a wounded Conscience and the Guilt of innocent Blood would always be accompanied with Remorse and Horror  He reflected that though he was a Subject his King had no Right to his Obedience when his Commands were contrary to the express Will and Pleasure of the Gods to whom he owed a higher Duty  He considered that the peaceful Calm of a contented Mind in an humble Condition was preferable to the restless Turbulence of Dignity and Riches when purchased with Crimes and stained with Blood and that honest Poverty was infinitely better than shameful Grandeur  Seeing therefore that he must either die with a clear Mind or live with a foul and spotted Conscience his Soul was so perplexed between these two Extremes that he could take no Rest at last he determined to discover the Affair to  Egistus  and for that Purpose he went to his Apartments and desiring a private Audience of the King of  Sicily  he was admitted to his Presence and in a few Words laid open the whole Conspiracy against him  The Brave and Generous are not easily induced to believe those they love are capable of Baseness and Ingratitude  Egistus  judging of  Pandosto  's Heart by the Rectitude of h  s own told  Franion  with a severe Countenance that he would not entertain a Thought to the Prejudice of the King of  Bohemia  's Honour  "Pandosto  continued he is my Friend and Ally no Suspicion has ever yet interrupted  our mutual Affection I did not come here to invade his Territories to seduce his Subjects from their Allegiance or to conspire with his Enemies Since therefore I have given him no Cause to seek my Death I cannot believe him guilty of so unjust and treacherous a Design but rather suspect the Information you have given me to be the Effect of a Combination among the  Bohemians  to create a Variance between me and their King"  Franion  replied "that it was dangerous to dally with the Rage of an incensed and secret Enemy that if the  Bohemians  had intended any Harm to him they might easily accomplish it without revealing their Conspiracy that it was unkind therefore in his Majesty to misconstrue his Zeal for his Preservation into a treacherous Design for that his Intention was to prevent Treason not to become a Traitor"  He urged him then to fly with Speed into  Sicily  if he hoped to escape the Danger which threatned him and begged his Majesty would permit him to go along with him when if he did not fully prove that  Pandosto  had designed to poison him he desired that his imagined Treachery might be punished with the most cruel Torments  Egistus  weighing the Matter thoroughly in his Mind gave many Thanks to  Franion  and promising if he arrived safe in  Sicily  to reward him royally he desired him to contrive the Method of their Escape  Franion  went immediately to consult with the Admiral of  Egistus  's Fleet and it was agreed between them that it should be put in Readiness to sail as soon as a fair Wind and Opportunity offered  In the mean Time  Franion  amused  Pandosto  with Hopes of soon having his so much desired Revenge accomplished telling him that he was employed in preparing and compounding so subtle a Poison that the Moment it was swallowed would procure immediate Death  Pandosto  received this News with a malignant Joy every Hour seeming an Age to his impatient Fury till His Revenge was satiated with the Death of those who had offended him  Egistus  being informed that a favourable Gale had sprung up conveyed himself and his  Sicilians  by the Assistance of  Franion  out of a Postern Gate of the City with such Secresy and Expedition that they got on board their Ships without the least Suspicion and spreading all their Sails to the Wind soon lost Sight of  Bohemia  As soon as  Pandosto  was informed that  Egistus  had fled away in the Night and that  Franion  was gone with him he let loose all his Rage upon his Queen whom he accused of conspiring with  Egistus  and the Traitor  Franion  and commanded she should be led to Prison  The  Bohemians  were all alarmed and suspected some Treason and the furious  Pandosto  believing the Queen not only guilty of dishonouring his Bed but of projecting the Flight of  Egistus  sent his Guards with Orders to seize her  The innocent  Bellaria  not expecting the impending Storm was playing with her little Son  Garrinter  when the Guards with much Reluctance came to execute the King's Demands  The Queen was at first astonished and turned pale but recollecting herself and assuming all the noble Pride of conscious Innocence and affronted Virtue she gave her Hand to the Captain of the Guard and without murmuring suffered him to lead her to her Prison where she spent the Time in patient Sorrow and absolute Resignation  Pandosto  mad with the Disappointment of his Revenge upon  Egistus  resolved it should fall doubly heavy on the Head of the injured  Bellaria  he therefore caused it to be proclaimed throughout all his Dominions that the Queen had committed Adultery with  Egistus  and with his Cupbearer  Franion  had conspired his Death  Though the Queen's Life had hitherto appeared blameless yet this confident Proclamation and the Flight of the King of  Sicily  and  Franion  raised many Suspicions against her in the Minds of the People who notwithstanding daily offered up Prayers for her Deliverance  Her Youth her Beauty the Sweetness of her Manners but above all her Misfortunes excited every one's Compassion  But the cruel  Pandosto  in whose rocky Bosom Pity could find no Access resolved to load the unfortunate  Bellaria  with every Kind of Infamy and Hardship he would not allow her to be treated in the Prison with the Respect due to the Rank she once held but caused her to be served and attended with the most cruel Neglect  The Cruelties he exercised on the Queen did but in Part satisfy his Revenge he longed to make  Egistus  feel the Weight of his Fury But this Monarch was so powerful by his Allies having married the Emperor of  Russia  's Daughter that he despaired of ever being able by open Force to accomplish his Revenge  The unhappy Queen being informed of the vile Accusation against her so openly proclaimed conscious of her own spotless Innocence and the Integrity of  Egistus  earnestly intreated that she might be brought to a public Trial confronted with her Accuser and allowed to answer for herself  But the King was so inflamed with Rage and Jealousy that he would not receive her Petition and while the poor Queen was thus languishing under the Weight of her Calamities and hopeless of Redress she perceived herself to be quick with Child  So affecting an Incident in her melancholy Condition drew Complaints from her which softening the rugged Temper of her Keeper  he caused the King to be immediately informed of it not doubting but the News would induce him to set her at Liberty  The Queen's Pregnancy however produced quite a contrary Effect for the King no sooner heard of it than starting up in a violent Fury he swore  Bellaria  and her Bastard should die even though the Gods themselves should say no  The Queen notwithstanding so many cruel Afflictions was happily delivered of a Daughter and  Pandosto  immediately declared his Resolution to have both the Mother and Child burnt  The Noblemen of his Court used all the Arguments their Reason and Humanity could furnish them with to prevail upon him to change his barbarous Purpose but all they could do was to prevent the Murder of the Child  The Queen's Doom he told them was irrevocably fixed but though at the earnest Solicitations of his Nobles he promised the Child should not be put to Death yet the Resolution he took concerning it was little less cruel since by it he only meant to protract its Faté  He sent a Person to the Prison with Orders to take the Infant from its wretched Mother and putting it into a Boat and launching it into the Sea leave it to the Mercy of the Wind and Waves  The Guards who assisted at this barbarous Deed moved by the sweet Countenance of the innocent Babe could not help accusing the King of great Cruelty nevertheless Fear of his Resentment obliged them to execute his Commands  They put the Child into a Boat covering it with Boughs to preserve it from the Inclemency of the Weather and set it into the Ocean when immediately so great a Storm arose that it was with much Difficulty they got to shore again  This horrid Deed accomplished the King assembled his Nobles and Counsellors and  Bellaria  was brought into Court where she heard the Charge against her read  The Queen who saw nothing but her Death would satisfy the incensed King confiding in her own Innocence assumed all the Courage her unhappy Condition required and with a noble Haughtiness demanded to have Law and Justice "for Mercy said she I do not expect let my Accusers therefore appear in Court and give their Evidences before my Face"  Pandosto  replied "that the Witnesses were of such Credit that their Words alone were sufficient that for her indeed it was her Part to deny such a monstrous Crime and forswear herself seeing that she had overcome all Sense of Shame and Remorse in committing it nevertheless  added he you shall die and die a most cruel and ignominious Death"  The Queen not terrified by these Threats replied without any Emotion "that to proceed to Punishment without Proof was Rigour not Law"  The Nobles approved of what she said and required that her Accusers should be sworn and openly examined and if the Queen's Guilt was fully proved his Majesty might condemn her to suffer the Punishment ordained by the Law for such Offences  The King answered "that in this Case he could and would dispense with the Law and that the Nobles should take his Word for sufficient Evidence otherwise he would make the proudest of them repent it  This Threat struck them all dumb but  Bellaria  who despaired of Life and dreaded Infamy more than Death said "if his Will must be the Law the Jury's Verdict will be useless Then falling on her Knees she conjured the King by the Love he bore to the young Prince  Garrinter  his Son that he would grant her one Request which was to send six of his Nobles in whom he placed the greatest Confidence to the Island of  Delphos  and there consult the Oracle of  Apollo  concerning the Crimes she was accused of"  Pandosto  could not refuse so reasonable a Request and having named six Embassadors to be dispatched with all Speed to  Delphos  he  committed the Queen to close Imprisonment till their Return  The Ambassadors performed their Voyage in three Weeks and as soon as they landed at  Delphos  they went to the Temple of  Apollo  and with great Devotion offered Sacrifices to the God and Gifts to his Priests according to Custom and then humbly besought an Answer to their Demands  They had not kneeled long at the Altar when  Apollo  with a loud Vice said  "Bohemians  what you find behind the Altar take and depart" they obeyed the Oracle and found a Scroll of Parchment which the Priest commanded them not to open but in the Presence of the King  The Ambassadors assured him of their exact Obedience to his Injunctions and their Devotions being finished they left the Temple and sailed with a fair Wind for  Bohemia  where they soon arrived and hastened to Court  Pandosto  received them very graciously and they after giving him an Account of their Voyage presented the divine Scroll to him intreating him at the same Time since the Queen's Life or Death her Innocence or Guilt was contained in that sacred Writing that he would summon the Nobility to meet in the Judgment Hall and before them and the accused Queen cause the Oracle to be read  The King approved of their Advice and on the Day appointed the King and the Nobles being all assembled in the Court the Queen was brought to the Bar and thus spoke  "How I have led my Life before  Egistus  came into  Bohemia  I appeal  Pandosto  to thy Conscience and to the immortal Gods they only know whether I am guilty of the Crimes whereof I am accused for me I here protest my Innocence and for the Truth of what I say I refer myself to the divine Oracle  Here  Bellaria  being silent the King commanded one of his Nobles to open the Scroll which he did and read aloud the following Words which were written in Letters of Gold  The ORACLE  "Suspicion is no Proof Jealousy is a partial Judge  Bellaria  is chaste  Egistus  blameless  Franion  a true Subject  Pandosto  treacherous his Babe innocent and the King shall die without an Heir if that which is lost be not found"  After the Oracle was read the Court resounded with joyful Acclamations the Queen's Innocence thus manifested filled every Heart with Transport  The King beginning now to be ashamed of his rash Jealousy and unjust Suspicions not  daring to approach the wronged  Bellaria  desired his Nobles to implore her to forgive the Injuries he had offered her and stung with Remorse and Horror at his past Actions he publickly confessed his Design against the Life of  Egistus  While he was thus laying open his own Treachery a Messenger came hastily into the Court and informed the King that the Prince  Garrinter  was dead  Bellaria  whose Soul had been overwhelmed with Joy by the divine Oracle which had declared her Innocence was seized with such an Excess of Sorrow at these dreadful Tidings that her tender Heart not able to support the Force of these contrary Extreams burst with the mighty Weight and sinking down she expired in a Moment  The King became senseless at this dreadful Sight and being carried to the Palace notwithstanding all the Endeavours of the Physicians he lay speechless three Days  The  Bohemians  were in the utmost Despair nothing but Mourning and Complaints were to be seen and heard the Death of the Queen and Prince and the extream Danger the King was in filled the whole City with Grief and Consternation at length he recovered his Senses and his Speech and this News in some Measure revived the drooping  Bohemians  But the King's Despair was so violent that he attempted to murder himself and was with  Difficulty prevented by his Nobles who used all the Arguments they could think of to calm his Mind and perswade him to bear his Misfortunes patiently  Their dutiful Cares at last succeeded the King grew more patient and resigned and gave Orders for the Interment of his Queen and Son which was performed in the most solemn and splendid Manner  Once in every Day he went to  Bellaria  's Tomb and with Tears of Penitence and Sorrow lamented her unhappy Fate and his own Misfortunes  Here we must leave this distressed Prince for a while to relate what befell the Royal Infant whom we left floating on the Ocean  The Boat in which it was laid being tost for two Days with the Wind and Sea and every Moment ready to perish in the Waves it pleased the Gods to direct it at last to the Coast of  Sicily  where it was drove on Shore  It fortunately happened that a Shepherd who had missed one of his Sheep not finding it in any of the Covers hard by came to the Seaside in Hopes it was there browsing on the SeaIvy and hearing the Voice of a Child which he at first mistook for the Bleating of a Sheep went to the Sands and saw a Boat driven on Ground he immediately waded towards it and discovered a most beautiful Babe lying at the Bottom wrapt in a Scarlet  Mantle embroidered with Gold and a Chain of rich Jewels about its Neck  The Shepherd astonished at this Adventure beholding the Beauty of the Infant and the Riches that were about it began to think it was some little Divinity and was going to adore it when the weak Cries of the Child who seemed to be just perishing with Cold and Hunger persuaded him it was a meer Mortal  Compassion took the Place of Reverence he approached the Child took it into his Arms and supposing by the extraordinary Magnificence of its Dress that it was of noble Birth he resolved to carry it to the King  As he was wrapping the Mantle close about it to preserve it better from the Cold a Bag of Money fell from it at his Feet which he takeing up was so captivated with the Sight that changing his Design he determined to breed up the Infant himself and apply the Money to his own Use then returned a bye Way to his Cottage lest any one should perceive what he carried in his Arms  As soon as he entered the Door the Child began to cry which alarming his Wife who supposed he was bringing home a Bastard to nurse she rated him very severely for his Infidelity  The Shepherd begged her to be pacified and told her if she would be secret and cautious their Fortunes were made for ever then  putting the Child in her Arms he produced the Gold and Jewels he found with it which so pleased the poor Woman that she resolved to nurse the Child carefully and make their Neighbours believe it was their own  The Gold and Jewels they concealed and the Shepherd returned to the Care of his Flocks while his Wife employed herself in nursing the Foundling to whom they gave the Name of  Fawnia  In a few Years after the Shepherd purchased a good Farm and from tending the Flocks of other People became Master of a considerable one himself  When  Fawnia  arrived at the Age of ten Years  Porrus  and  Mopsa  for so her supposed Father and Mother were called committed the Care of their Flocks to her and the young Shepherdess whose Beauty at those early Years was the Astonishment and Admiration of all that beheld her applied herself with the utmost Diligence to her pastoral Employment so that every Thing prospered under her Hands  Porrus  now purchased Land which he designed to leave  Fawnia  at his Death and she growing to fifteen Years old many of the rich Farmer's Sons made their Addresses to her  The fair Shepherdess was not the only Admiration and Wonder of the Country her Wit and Judgment was equal to her Beauty and  those uncommon Charms of Mind and Person made her even be talked of at Court  She who believed herself to be the Daughter of  Porrus  was not elated with the Praises that were bestowed on her but with a sweet Humility conformed to the Lowliness of her Condition and tended her Flocks with the utmost Diligence and Care  Though she was not vain of the Graces of her Person yet her rural Habit was always exactly neat her lovely Hair was bound up with a graceful Negligence and she took Care to choose the freshest and most becoming Flowers to compose the Garland which shaded her charming Face from the Sun  The King of  Sicily  had only one Son named  Dorastus  a beautiful and accomplished Youth of whom the  Sicilians  had great Hopes  The King desirous of seeing him married before he died sent an Ambassador to the King of  Denmark  to demand the Princess  Euphania  his Daughter and the Heir to his Dominions in Marriage for the Prince of  Sicily  The King of  Denmark  agreeing to the Proposal  Egistus  acquainted his Son with the Treaty he had entered into he enlarged on the Beauty and Virtues of the Princess  Euphania  on the Advantages of an Alliance with the King of  Denmark  and concluded with praising the Gods for the happy Success of his Negociation  Dorastus  heard all this with such apparent Indifference that the King was amazed and asked him if he had any Objection to the Match  The Prince answered coldly "That his Heart was yet a Stranger to Love that all Women were indifferent to him and that Marriage was an Engagement he had no Inclination to enter into"  The King extremely offended with this Reply threatened him with the severest Effects of his Displeasure if he did not endeavour to conform to his Will and finding the Prince continued in a sullen Silence and would give him no Satisfaction he quitted him in great Displeasure  Dorastus  was sensibly afflicted at his Father's Anger and ardently wished he could conquer that Repugnance he felt in his Soul to Marriage that he might not offend him by an absolute Refusal but the more he struggled to overcome that Dislike which forced him to seem disobedient to his Father the deeper he found it rooted in his Breast  A short Time after this Discourse had passed between the King and the Prince there happened to be a Meeting of all the Shepherds Daughters in  Sicily  Fawnia  was chosen Queen for the Day and drest in her best Cloaths presided over their rural Sports the Day being past in such innocent Diversions as Shepherdesses when  Evening approached they separated and  Fawnia  desiring a neighbouring Sheperdess to go with her to see if her Flock was folded  Dorastus  who was returning from Hawking met the two Virgins as they were going home and struck with Admiration at the Beauty of  Fawnia  he stopt and asked her several trifling Questions in order to have an Opportunity of gazing on her  Fawnia  aswered him with so much sprightly Wit and so graceful an Air that the Prince already half vanquished by the Charms of her Person was wholly subdued by those of her Mind Love offended at the former Obstinacy of this young Rebel resolved now to make him feel the utmost Effects of his Power and with the keenest Arrow in his Quiver pierced that once insensible Heart  The Prince sighed with Pain and Pleasure he could not remove his Eyes from the lovely Face of  Fawnia  which was all overspread with a rosy Blush he saw her Confusion and ashamed of his own Weakness he resolved to force himself away and clapping Spurs to his Horse he hastily bid the Shepherdesses farewel and rode home to the Palace  Fawnia  who had surveyed the Prince with a curious Eye began as soon as he was gone  o praise him to her Companion she admired his Youth his Beauty his sweet Affability The pleasing Theme transported her beyond her usual Moderation her Thoughts were  full of the Prince's Perfections she could not find Words sufficient to express her Admiration she perceived at length and blushed at her Indiscretion and remained silent and composed during the rest of their Walk  She took Leave of her Companion at the Door of her Cottage and retired to Bed full of a pleasing Anxiety for which her inexperienced Innocence could not yet find a Name  The Prince whose Mind was still more restless and uneasy than  Fawnia  's because he better understood the nature of his Distemper passed the Night in various and tormenting Thoughts Fain would he have banished the sweet Image of  Fawnia  from his Remembrance but Love had engraved it too deeply in his Heart and finding his Endeavours to forget her fruitless he sought to excuse and justify his Passion by reflecting on the inevitable Charms of her that caused it  "Oh cruel oh injurious Fortune cried he transported with the bright Idea to hide such Perfection in a Cottage and lavish Crowns and Scepters often on Deformity"  "Oh  Fawnia  was that inchanting Form made only to grace the Fields were these bright Eyes ordained to shine in humble Vales and only bless rude Swains with their Love darting Beams was that sprightly Wit and those native Graces of thy Mind given thee to be for ever clouded in a Cottage"  "Ah no it cannot be the Gods are just and equal in their Dispensations and though they did not make you born a Princess they did more and made you deserving to be one  I am their Instrument to raise you to the Rank for which Nature designed you and which no other can so worthily fill  The amorous Prince paused at these Words then suddenly giving Way to new Reflexions "How would it please my Father cried he to know that my Heart is capable of Love oh divine Law feared by all Men because honoured by the Gods themselves"  "But alas  Dorastus  added he breathing a deep and dreadful Sigh who is it that is the Object of thy Passion a rural Maid the Daughter of a simple Shepherd Does this Match suit with the Dignity of thy Birth thou who art the Son of a King and Heir to a powerful Kingdom Ah let me rather die than poorly submit to such a shameful Weakness for 'tis better to perish nobly than to live with Contempt"  The wavering Prince resting a while upon this thought endeavoured to collect his whole Force of Reason to support a Resolution which seemed worthy of himself but Love who laughed at all his vain Attempts to elude his Power again imprest the lovely Image of  Fawnia  upon his Fancy  "Oh Beauty said the sighing Prince how absolute is thy Empire over the Heart sweet and imperious Tyrant thou shalt be obeyed I yield to thy irresistable Force yes  Fawnia  lovely and adorable  Fawnia  thou shalt be mine thy humble Birth shall be no Obstacle to my Desires"  "The Gods themselves have not disdained to love  Jupiter  was enamoured of  Danaë  and the bright  Apollo  woed the inexorable  Daphne  these were mortal Beauties and they were Deities why then though a Prince may not I love a Shepherdess but their Passions were dishonourable mine is pure and chaste 'tis true and herein I surpass the Gods Be still then oh my Soul for 'tis decreed  Fawnia  the adorable  Fawnia  shall be mine"  The Prince having thus taken his Resolution his Mind grew easy and composed but it was far otherwise with the charming Shepherdess strange and unusual Dreams perplexed her roving Fancy the whole Night  That homely Couch which before had only supplied calm and unrufled Slumbers and chearful Dreams of pleasant Labour and innocent Amusements past now gave Birth to anxious Wishes delusive Hopes and uneasy Repinings  She awaked but not as usual refreshed with her Repose her renewed Spirits sparkling in her chearful Eyes and eager to begin the rural Labours of the Day but heavy languishing and full of uneasy Perturbations she rose before her wonted Hour and thinking to banish the various Thoughts which tormented her by industrious Toils she drove her Flocks to the Field shifted the Folds and doubled her Morning's Work at last fatigued and breathless she sat down at the Foot of a Tree and thus began to accuse the Folly and Presumption of her new Passion  "Unfortunate  Fawnia  said she softly sighing thy Shepherdess's Hook expresses thy mean Condition and thy Desires shew thy aspiring Mind Ah simple Maid Thoughts above Fortune bring Contempt 'tis for the Eagle only to gaze on the Sun art thou not a poor Shepherdess the Daughter of a Country Swain be content then to stand securely in the Vale and do not by endeavouring to climb the Hills hazard the Danger of a Fall But oh Love is a powerful Lord and will be obeyed I love  Dorastus  ah the more wretched I the less Cause I have to hope Will Eagles catch at Flies or Cedars stoop to Brambles  Dorastus  is a Prince and knows what his Station requires of him I am the poor Daughter of a Shepherd and forget my humble Condition"  "Cease then to love unhappy  Fawnia  or if thou canst not do that conceal at least thy wrong placed Passion for it is better to die with Grief than live with Shame but oh Gods why did you give me a Soul capable of the most exalted Passion and yet place me in a Condition which makes that Passion Presumption"  The lovely Shepherdess having thus given Vent to her uneasy Thoughts rose up and began to walk round her Flock gathering up he straggling Sheep to prevent them from go  ng among the Corn and while she was thus employed endeavoured to conquer her too much raised Desires by contemplating her  mean Estate and the apparent Impossibility of ever accomplishing her Wishes  Mean Time  Dorastus  consumed away with impatient Desire his former Pleasures now grew tasteless to his Sense Company was tedious Music only soothed his sweet Disorder and added Fewel to his Fires  Weary at length of the intolerable Restraint his Pride had forced him to lay upon his Wishes he resolved to satisfy his longing Eyes with another Sight of the sweet but dangerous  Fawnia  For this Purpose he stole secretly out of the Palace and without any Attendants took his Way to the Fields where he had first seen the beauteous Shepherdess  Fawnia  There he walked some Time without meeting with the Object his passionate Eyes were every where in Search of Enraged at his Disappointment a thousand Times he curst both Love and Fortune and just as he was resigning himself to the most bitter Despair for his ill Success in this first Attempt a casual Glance discovered  Fawnia  to him sitting on the Side of a Hill selecting the most beautiful Flowers out of a large Heap which in sweet Confusion were scattered about her to make a fresh Garland for her Head  The passionate Prince stood at a little Distance for some Moments contemplating her with an Excess of Wonder and Delight when  Fawnia  happening to look up she met  his ardent Gaze and this sudden and unexpected Sight gave her so much Emotion that her fair Face was in an Instant dyed with a rosy Blush  She rose however from her Seat and curt'sied to the Prince but with such native Elegance and Grace that  Dorastus  who could not conceive how a Country Maid bred up in the Fields and Woods could have so much Politeness in her Manner was lost in Astonishment and Admiration  "Fair Virgin said he approaching her either your Poverty is great or the Life of a Shepherdess is very sweet that you can take such Delight in rural Labours is it because you are so like a Nymph that you resolve to imitate the Nymphs and waste your Days in Woods and Lawns Tell me sweet Maid what Pleasures are there in a Country Life to balance  ts Fatigue"  "Sir said  Fawnia  with an inchanting Bashfulness to be contented is to be rich that Condition is most to be coveted in which  here is most Tranquility as we Shepherdesses are not born to Honour and little beholden  o Beauty so Fame or Fortune is beneath our Care we are not solicitous for any Thing  ut the Necessaries of Life we think our Rayment fine if it preserves us sufficiently from the cold and our Food dainty if it suffices Appetite our greatest Enemy is the Wolf and our Chief Care is to keep our Flocks in Security we spend the Day in rural  Songs and delight more in talking of Pan and Country Sports than  Venus  and her trifling Toys our Toil is to shift our Folds but the attending our Flocks is only an agreeable Amusement our Wealth consists in not desiring more than we possess our Honour in not aiming to be higher than we are Envy looks not so low as a Shepherd Shepherds do not raise their Thoughts to Ambition we are rich because we are content with our Poverty and proud only in knowing we have no Cause to be proud"  Dorastus  was charmed with this sprightly Answer Oh thought he if this fair Creature's Birth was equal to her Wit and Beauty she would be a Wife for the greatest Prince in the World  "I perceive  Fawnia  said the Prince addressing himself to her again that 'tis owing to your not being acquainted with the Enjoyments of a Court that you are so contented with a Country Life I commend your Wit and Prudence but I pity your Poverty and low Condition Will you forsake your Father's Cottage and attend on a Lady a  Court"  "'Tis dangerous Sir answered  Fawnia  to tempt Fortune she is a fickle Goddess and often raises poor Mortals only to throw them down again I was born to toil for the Court and not live in it and am entirely satisfied with my present Condition"  "Ah  Fawnia  said  Dorastus  with a Sigh he could not suppress I guess the Cause of your Fondness for a rural Life you love a Country Shepherd"  "Sir replied  Fawnia  smiling pardon me if I tell you you have not guessed right Shepherds alas they cannot love they are so simple and Maids must not if they are no older than I am"  "In my Opinion pretty one said the Prince Maids ought to love because they are young Cupid is a Child and the Goddess of Love is painted young"  "Age may indeed be painted with false Colours said  Fawnia  and Youth may have Actions too forward but what Art too little conceals in one Ignorance reveals in the other"  Dorastus  who thought this Conversation the most pleasing of any he ever had would have perhaps drawn it out to a considerable Length but perceiving some of his Attendants approaching he was willing to know a little more of her Heart before he parted from her  "Perhaps  Fawnia  said he taking her Hand I love thee if so you must needs yield me your Heart for I am a Prince you know and may command you"  "I acknowledge your Power Sir said  Fawnia  in all just and reasonable Things but with Submission I must say my Heart is only at my own Disposal constrained Love is Force and Force you have no Right to use over me and believe me it is not a vain Beast I make when I tell you that poor as I am I set so great a Value upon my Chastity that I would rather die than be the Mistress of the greatest King upon Earth and my Birth is so mean and groveling that I am not fit to be a Farmer's Wife"  The lovely Shepherdess ended these Words with a Sigh which escaped her unawares  The Prince after a little Pause replied "It seems then  Fawnia  that you cannot love  Dorastus"  "Yes said  Fawnia  precipitately when  Dorastus  becomes a Shepherd"  The Prince's Attendants being now come near he hastily went to meet them leaving  Fawnia  alone and pensive her Imagination filled with a thousand new Ideas  She seated herself again at the Foot of the Hill revolving in her Mind all the Prince had said to her and this second View of him together with the Affability of his Behaviour and some flattering Hopes she began to entertain entirely compleated the Conquest of her Heart  For some Moments she resigned herself up to the most soothing Reflexions but when the Lowness of her Condition rushed upon her  Thoughts and broke the sweet Delusion she was so fond of then she began to blame the Extravagance of her Wishes and tried to recollect her scattered Reason  "Ah  Fawnia  whispered she why dost thou gaze at the Sun and grasp at Wind Stars are to be beheld at a Distance not aimed to be touched with the Hand Hopes are to be measured by Fortune not impelled by Desire and Falls come by climbing high not by sitting low But what then added she after a little Pause must all fall who endeavour to rise because some do no Happiness comes by Chance and Fortune winds those Threads which the Destinies spin Alas what strange Perplexity am I in favoured by a Prince yet obliged through Prudence to reject that Favour Denial in my Words and Desire at the bottom of my Heart I love  Dorastus  yet I seem displeased with his Courtship Ah 'tis our Sex's Fault to fly from those we eagerly wish to meet But take Heed  Fawnia  said she sighing for if the Prince is repulsed by thy Shyness thou wilt severely repent for unless he loves thou must die Ah die then simple Maid for  Dorastus  only jests with thee  Dorastus  cannot stoop to love a Shepherdess sit down then in thy Sorrow and pine in secret Ah me how am I changed I was wont to pass away my Days in chearful Songs now I waste them in Sighs and Complaints"  While  Fawnia  was thus giving Vent to the tender Anxieties of her Soul the Approach of Night put her in Mind that it was Time to put her Sheep in the Fold which having done with a heavy Heart she hastened to her poor Cottage  While Love made this Havock in the innocent Breast of  Fawnia  he raged with such Violence in the Heart of the passionate Prince in which the Pride of royal Birth maintained an unequal Conflict that sinking under the Force of those contrary Passions he became a Prey to Melancholy and Despair he loathed his Food Sleep fled from his Eyes he grew pale and wan and fell into a languishing Disease  The King amazed at the Alteration in his Son and trembling for his Life ordered the Attendance of the ablest Physicians in his Kingdom but their Art was all in vain  The Prince himself grew apprehensive of the Danger he was in he found he could not live without  Fawnia  and thought it great Folly to die for what it was in his Power to obtain Honour long opposed the Gratification of his Desires but Love resistless Love at Length prevailed  The Prince wholly abandoning himself to the Power of this sweet Tyrant procured a Shepherd's Habit and a Crook and making them to be conveyed to a secret Place he  went privately out of the Palace and attiring himself in those rural Weeds took his Way to the Place where his charming Shepherdess fed her Flocks  As he went along some uneasy Reflexions arose in his Mind when he surveyed his homely Dress  "Ah  Dorastus  said he to himself what a strange Alteration is here a Prince transformed to a Peasant does this wild Folly suit with the Dignity of thy Birth but indeed thy Habit suits well with thy groveling Thoughts this is thy proper Dress thou wert always disguised before Oh Gods for what Crime am I assigned this Penance Oh Love what a fond Ideot hast thou made of me"  "Yet why should I blush at this Disguise have not the heavenly Deities descended to Earth and changed their glorious Forms for Love Love made  Jupiter  a Bull  Neptune  a Ram and  Apollo  like myself a Shepherd If they who were Gods submitted to that allcompelling Power shall I who am a Mortal dare to rebel against it"  While the Prince was thus justifying the strange Effects of his Passion by those great Examples he spied  Fawnia  at a Distance running after one of her Sheep which had strayed from the rest The Sight of that lovely Face supprest in a Moment all other Emotions but those of Love and Joy  He flew towards her and she who did not know him in that Disguise but thought  it was some genteel young Shepherd coming to meet her secretly wished it had been her Lot to have placed her Affections upon such a one whom with Reason she might have loved and hoped to have obtained  The Prince's nearer Approach convinced her of her Mistake she sighed and blushed with Pleasure and Surprize and stopping curt'sied to him with her usual Gracefulness  Dorastus  taking her Hand prest it with passionate Tenderness to his Heart and then fixing an ardent Kiss upon it begged her to sit down and listen to him a few Moments  The lovely Shepherdess trembling with the mixed Emotions which Love Hope and Fear excited in her Soul sat down with him under the Shade of a spreading Oak and the Prince after gazing on her for some Time with a fixed Attention thus spoke  "You wonder  Fawnia  no Doubt at my strange Apparel but if you knew my Thoughts you'd wonder more the one indeed disgraces my outward Shape but the others disturb my Mind"  "I love you  Fawnia  for how can I do otherways formed as you are to inspire all who see you with that Passion You promised to love me when I became a Shepherd behold your Prince transformed to a Country Swain Now then I claim the Performance of your Promise since I have fulfilled your Desire"  "'Tis true my Lord said  Fawnia  you are changed in Appearance but 'tis in Appearance only painted Eagles are not Eagles and Zuexis' Grapes as I have read were only Painted Grapes rich Ornaments do not make Princes nor rural Weeds a Swain Shepherds are not called so because they wear pastoral Attire and have a Crook and Scrip but because they attend their Flocks and take Care of their rural Affairs this Apparel therefore has not made a Shepherd of a Prince but makes a Prince appear like a Shepherd"  "Had I been born a Shepherd replied  Dorastus  I should have loved you willingly and being a Prince I am constrained to love you do not then with an unseasonable Coyness reject a Passion which you only could have inspired now is your Time to love and be beloved while that sweet Bloom glows in your charming Face and every Feature smiles with the Gaiety of Youth Have you not observed the Fate of these beautiful Flowers with which you so often adorn your lovely Hair they bud they bloom they wither and are neglected such is your Beauty  Fawnia  in Youth it is praised admired and coveted in Age forgotten and despised yield then to virtuous Love for notwithstanding the Inequality of our Conditions I mean to make you my Wife"  "Fawnia  transported with Surprize and Joy at this unhoped for Declaration no longer  kept up her forced Indifference but beholding the Prince with a languishing Sweetness her Face being all o'erspread with Blushes "Ah my Lord said she I am ashamed to discover the Thoughts which have long filled my Mind Ought I Beggar as I am to own my Desires have reached at a Prince Oh  Dorastus  I dare not say I love you because you are the Son of a great King and I am a poor Shepherdess but the Gods know how I have honoured  Dorastus  receive then my humble my dutiful Affection and look on me as your Handmaid ever ready to obey your Will in all Things which are not prejudicial to my Honour  Dorastus  overjoyed at this sweet and modest Confession of her Love for him embraced her with a passionate Tenderness calling all the Gods to witness the Vows he made her of everlasting Love and Fidelity and now the Lovers began to consult upon the Measures they should take to be united for ever  Dorastus  who knew his Father would be excessively enraged at such a Match told  Fawnia  there could be no Safety for them in  Sicily  and that therefore he would provide a sufficient Quantity of Money and Jewels to support them till some favourable Change happened in their Affairs and with the Treasure fly into  Italy  and there solemnize their Nuptials  This Proposal was agreed to with great Joy by  Fawnia  who trembled at the Thoughts of the King's discovering their Love believing  that nothing less than Death would be inflicted on her for her Presumption She therefore urged the Prince to make the necessary Preparations for their Flight with the utmost Speed lest Fortune should cruelly prevent their Intentions  The Prince whose eager Passion prompted him no less than her Fears to hasten their Departure assured her all should be ready in a few Days and now the approaching Night warning them to depart he took Leave of  Fawnia  with a tender Embrace and repairing to the Place where he had left his Cloaths threw off his Shepherd's Frock and returned to the Palace  Fawnia  was so transported with the unexpected Tide of good Fortune which had come rushing on her that for some Time she could hardly persuade herself that all was not a Dream but when the Tumult of her Joy was a little allayed and calmer Reflexions succeeding convinced her of the Reality of her Happiness she thanked the Gods devoutly for their amazing Bounty to her and beseeched them to continue their Favour and Protection to her and her beloved Prince  In the mean time  Dorastus  lost no Opportunity of seeing his lovely Shepherdess she drove her Flocks to the Fields every Day and continued to watch them as usual not from any Delight she now took in her pastoral Employment but in the dear Hope of seeing her beloved Lord  Dorastus  notwithstanding he always came to meet his  Fawnia  in the Habit of a Shepherd was at last discovered by some that knew him to be the Prince so that his frequent Visits to  Fawnia  making much Noise among the Country People some of  Porrus  's Neighbours out of good Will to the old Shepherd advised him to keep his Daughter at home and keep a strict Eye over her lest by going so often to the Field she should bring him home a young Son at last for that the young Prince came often to her and would certainly if he had not yet delude her and make her his Concubine  This News greatly surprized and alarmed the good old Man who after thanking his Neighbours for their kind Informations hastened home to his Wife and calling her aside and wringing his Hands the Tears fast falling down his aged Cheeks "O Wife said he I fear I fear our Daughter  Fawnia  has committed Sin and that she will buy Repentance at a dear Rate I have sad News to tell you My Neighbours tell me that the young Prince  Dorastus  looks upon  Fawnia  with a wistful Eye and if that is the Case I would not give a Wisp of Straw for her Honesty at the Year's End  "I tell thee Wife that Beauty is a great Snare to entrap young Men and fair Words and fine Promises are great Enemies to a Maiden's Honesty the Poor may entreat and be refused but Princes if Entreaties won't  o may command and then who can resist  hem  "But it is a hard Case though said the old Man sobbing where the Lust of a Prince is  he Law and that he should bind poor Folks to that which he himself freely breaks"  "Take heed what you say said the good Wife with a sagacious Look speak no more than you should lest you hear what you would not do what you can but no more than you may great Streams may be stopped by Art but not by Force take Care of yourself lest by endeavouring to save  Fawnia  's Honesty you lose your own Head It is dangerous the Proverb says to play with edged Tools and bad to sport with Princes remember the Wolf had his Skin stripped over his Ears for looking into the Lion's Den"  "You speak like a Fool said  Porrus  who could not relish his Wife's sage Council if the King should hear that  Dorastus  loves our Daughter his Fury would be such that we might lose our Goods if not our Lives A Thought has just now entered my Head by which I will prevent the King's being offended with us and perhaps it may not displease the Prince I will carry the Chain and Jewels I found with  Fawnia  to the King and confess that she is not my Daughter and tell him the whole Story of my finding her the King may perhaps take her under his own Care and then whatever happens we shall be blameless"  The good Wife was well enough pleased with this Proposal and it was resolved between them to take the first Opportunity of speaking to the King  In the mean time  Dorastus  had communicated his Design of leaving  Sicily  to a faithful Domestic who had attended his Person from his Childhood named  Capnio  This Man at first endeavoured to dissuade him from so rash and dangerous an Enterprize but finding the Prince determined to depart he ceased to trouble him with any more fruitless Expostulations and prepared to assist him in the Prosecution of a Design which though he did not approve he saw it was impossible to prevent unless by betraying his Master to the King a Piece of Treachery he could not bring himself to commit being bound as well by his own Inclinations as a sacred Oath the Prince had made him take to the contrary  He therefore with great Secrecy and Expedition provided a Vessel to transport them to  Italy  and the Prince having furnished himself with a great Quantity of Money and Jewels gave Orders to  Capnio  to get some rich Apparel for  Fawnia  the Baggage was all safely conveyed on board and the Master of the Ship perceiving the Wind likely to be favourable in a few Hours he gave  Capnio  Notice that they must come on board early the next Morning  Capnio  having informed the Prince of this he sent him to  Fawnia  desiring her to be in the Fields by break of Day where he would meet her and carry her to the Port  She slept but little that Night Love Fear and anxious Expectation kept her waking At the first Dawn of Light she rose and unfolding her Sheep drove them to the Fields giving many a longing look for her beloved Prince at last he appeared on Horseback she ran eagerly to meet him and he dismounting after printing a hasty Kiss upon her trembling Lips took her up behind him and galloped as fast as possible to the Haven where the Ship lay  The Sailors perceiving him at a Distance rowed to Shore with their Boat and taking in the Lovers carried them safe on board where we must leave them to see what happened at Land  Porrus  having heard that the King intended to take the Air that Morning put on his Holiday Cloaths and taking the Chain and Jewels he found with  Fawnia  concealed in his Bosom he took his Way to the Palace intending to watch the King's coming out at the Gate  Fortune determining to favour the Lovers a little longer flung  Capnio  who was hasting to the Port with a Casket in the old Man's Way  Capnio  seeing him taking the Road to the Palace and knowing him to be the Father of  Fawnia  asked him where he was going so early  Porrus  who knew him to be a Courtier replied that Prince  Dorastus  had dealt very hardly with him I have but one Daughter  said the good Man who to say the Truth has some share of Beauty I have Reason to apprehend the Prince has seduced her and I am going to complain to his Majesty of this Injury  Capnio  immediately foreseeing all the fatal Consequences that might attend the old Man's Complaint at that critical Time resolved to prevent it and therefore began to wheedle him by blaming the Prince for so unworthy a Design and added because he was a poor Man and had no Friends to stand by him himself would assist him in all he could but said he you will lose your Labour if you go to the Palace for the King designs to take the Air to day on board a Ship that lies in the Harbour and is already set out therefore if you will be ruled by me as I am going to give them Notice of his Majesty's coming that they may be prepared to receive him I will take you with me and place you so conveniently that you shall have all the Liberty you can desire to make your Complaint  Porrus  thanked his new Friend with great Submission for his proffered Kindness and went with him to the Port still complaining of the Prince but concealed the Chain and Jewels and mentioned nothing concerning  Fawnia  's being a Foundling  The Sailors seeing  Capnio  sent a Boat for him but now  Porrus  's Heart failed he began to suspect some Design upon him and when  Capnio  asked him to go into the Boat he refused under Pretence of being afraid of the  Sea  Capnio  pressed him but to no Purpose whereupon as there was no Time to be lost he ordered the Mariners who came in the Boat to carry him in by Force  Porrus  now saw he was betrayed but thinking it would be fruitless to cry out or exclaim against his false Friend he civilly entreated him and the Sailors to be kind to him and pity his Condition who was but a poor Man and lived by his Labour and should be undone if he was absent long from his Flocks  But they were as deaf to his Entreaties as the Winds and Waves to the Prayers of sinking Mariners and laughed to see him so much afraid having reached their Ship they obliged him to go on board where the first Objects he cast his Eyes on were the Prince and  Fawnia  She being drest in rich Apparel he scarce knew her at first so much was her native Beauty heightened by the Magnificence of her Cloaths in which she appeared with such a graceful Ease that it seemed as if she had never been accustomed to any other  Porrus  stood gazing on her at a Distance greatly astonished at what he saw and wondering where it would end and the Prince and  Fawnia  who were equally surprized to see him there eagerly asked  Capnio  for what Purpose he was come  Capnio  informed them that he met him as he was going to complain to the King of the Injury he suspected the Prince had offered him in the Person of his Daughter and that he had prevented his Design by Artifice  nd brought him forcibly to the Ship adding  that it was absolutely necessary they should take him with them to  Italy  otherwise their Discovery would be inevitable  The Prince approved this Advice but  Fawnia  who loved and respected the old Shepherd as her Father heard this Resolution with great Concern  Porrus  understanding that he should be carried from his Wife his Country and Friends into a strange Land burst into Tears and Complaints and falling on his Knees earnestly entreated  Dorastus  to pardon his rash Folly and permit him to return home assuring him he would be as secret as the Grave But the Prince could not be prevailed upon by all his Protestations to hazard the Danger of a Discovery and though  Fawnia  herself with Tears conjured him to grant her Father's Request he continued obstinate in his Refusal assuring her their Ruin was inevitable if he complied  Fawnia  then applied herself to comfort the old Man as well as she could and the Ship with a fair Gale pursued her Voyage  While this passed at Sea  Egistus  who intended to hunt that Morning the Prince departed sent to desire his Son's Company in that Diversion hoping it would help to remove the Melancholy which had of late hung upon him  The Gentleman of his BedChamber returned Answer that the Prince went that Morning very early to walk as he supposed in the Grove as was his daily Custom whereupon  he King sent some of his Attendants to look  or the Prince in that Place but they coming  ack without him the King attended by his No  les went to the Chace and after spending the Day in hunting returned to the Palace sur  rized at not finding his Son yet come home  e ordered strict Search to be made for him  is not appearing that Night filled him with a  housand uneasy Apprehensions and the next Day Messengers were dispatched all over the  ingdom to seek for him  The unhappy King at length supposing he  ad fallen a Prey to the wild Beasts in the  orest ordered several Parties of Horse to  our the Country round and if possible bring  m some Intelligence of his Fate  Some of these Men meeting a Fisherman  ear the Seaside mending his Nets they en  ired if he had seen or heard any thing of  e Prince and he very ingenuously told them  at a few Days ago he had seen the Prince  ith  Fawnia  the Daughter of  Porrus  the old  hepherd himself and  Capnio  all go on board  Ship which instantly put off to Sea  This News was immediately carried to the  ing who full of Surprize and Grief or  ered the Wife of  Porrus  to be brought before  m and examined her himself concerning  e Flight of her Husband and Daughter with  s Son  The old Woman told the King that her  eighbours had informed her Husband the  rince was too familiar with his Daughter he apprehending  something worse would follow and hearing his Majesty intended to hunt a few Days ago he rose early in the Morning with an Intention to complain to his Majesty of the Injury he feared the Prince intended to do  Fawnia  and added with Tears that she had never seen her Husband since  Egistus  perceiving the unfeigned Simplicity with which she told her Tale dismissed her but reflected so deeply upon the dishonourable Action his Son had committed that he fell into a Fever and continued so weak and ill that his Physicians had no Hopes of his Recovery  But  Dorastus  who regarded neither Father Country nor Crown now he was in Possession of his beloved  Fawnia  never troubled himself about the Grief his strange Flight would occasion the King and all the  Sicilians  but resigned himself wholly up to the Contemplation of his present Happiness which he would not have quitted for all the Empires in the World  The Winds for some Time seemed to favour their Flight and they steered their Course to  Italy  without any Interruption but one Morning the Sky began to be overcast with Clouds the Winds grew high the Sea swelled and at last a Storm ensued which raged during three Days with such unceasing Fury that the Ship was so much damaged the Sailors expected every Moment it would sink  Poor  Fawnia  was almost dying with her Fears but the Sight of  Dorastus  who never left her a Moment yielded her some Comfort amidst the Horrors of approaching Death On the fourth Morning the Storm abated and the Sailors discovered Land which they soon knew to be the Coast of  Bohemia  Their confused Shouts of Joy gave  Dorastus  to understand they were in Sight of some Harbour and with Tears of Joy and Tenderness he congratulated  Fawnia  on their Safety  But when he was told it was the Coast of  Bohemia  upon which they were driven remembering the Enmity there was between the King of that Country and his Father whom he had sought to poison he was greatly perplexed not knowing what to do or whether it was better to trust to the Fury of the Winds and Waves than the Treachery and Cruelty of the inhuman  Pandosto  Capnio  who saw it was impossible to expect any Safety at Sea advised the Prince to conceal his Name and Country and take up his Residence in some small Village till they could procure a Ship to carry them to  Italy  Dorastus  approved this Scheme and ordered  Capnio  to bid the Ship's Crew give out that his Name was  Meleagrus  a Gentleman of  Trapalonia  and assure them in his Name of a large Reward for their Secrecy  This done they went on Shore and hired Lodgings at a Farm House in a Village a Mile distant from the chief City of  Bohemia  as soon as they were recovered from the Fatigues  they had endured at Sea during the Storm  Dorastus  impatient to be united to his beloved  Fawnia  gave  Capnio  Orders to make Preparations for their Marriage  But in the mean time the Fame of  Fawnia  's Beauty was spread through all the Village and from thence reached the City and at last the Court nothing was talked of but the lovely Stranger whose wonderful Beauty was the Subject of general Admiration  Pandosto  though at that Time above sixty Years old was fired with the Reports he continually heard of this young Miracle and was resolved to see her and being informed they affected great Privacy and lodged in a very mean House he determined to have them seized on Suspicion of their being Spies and brought before him in order to be examined by himself  Accordingly he sent a small Party of his Guards to apprehend them who coming to the House where they lodged informed them that they must come before the King  Dorastus  not in the least daunted by this Message took  Fawnia  by the Hand and leaving  Porrus  to take Care of the  Treasure  followed the Guards together with  Capnio  Being introduced to the King they paid their Obeisance to him with a respectful Confidence that might have persuaded him of their Innocence had he really suspected them to have come into his Country with any bad Intention  But the King at the first Glance of  Fawnia  was so astonished at her wonderful Beauty that forgetting what he had to do for several Minutes he stood motionless like a Statue not able to remove his Eyes from that enchanting Object recovering himself at last he turned to  Dorastus  and asked him sternly who he was of what Country and with what Intent he had landed in  Bohemia  "Sir said  Dorastus  with a Countenance unchanged and a resolute Tone of Voice my Name is  Meleagrus  a Knight born and bred up in  Trapalonia  this young Woman whom I intend to make my Wife is a Native of  Italy  from whence I brought her the Reason I have so small a Train is that her Friends being unwilling to consent to her Marriage I took her away privately with an Intent to carry her to  Trapalonia  as we were sailing a violent Storm arose which drove us upon this Coast and I propose to stay no longer here than till our Ship is refitted and put into a Condition to pursue her Voyage"  Pandosto  either not satisfied or pretending not to be satisfied with this Account rose from his Seat in a Rage  "Meleagrus  said he I am not to be imposed upon by this unlikely Tale this Lady appears to be of a much higher Quality than you represent her and by the graceful Loveliness of her Person fitter to be the Wife of a great Prince than a simple Knight as you declare yourself to be"  "You have stolen away this young Lady from her unhappy Parents like a false Traitor  and as you have made them miserable by your Theft will no doubt shortly make her so too therefore till I can be thoroughly informed of her Birth and till you have produced a Certificate from  Trapalonia  to confirm the Account you have given of yourself I will detain ye all in  Bohemia"  The noble Mind of  Dorastus  could but ill brook the base Suspicions and injurious Language of  Pandosto  and almost forgetting the Character he assumed he looked on him with a Frown of Anger and Disdain and with a haughty Accent thus replied  "It is unworthy the Honour and Dignity of a Prince to reproach any Man with having committed scandalous Crimes without any Proof of his Guilt or even Suspicion to form a Belief on inoffensive Strangers ought to be treated with Kindness and Benevolence not with Distrust and Cruelty which is contrary to the Laws of Nations and the Customs of all civilized People but the Gods will severely revenge the Cause of those who through Inability to right themselves are obliged to put up with Wrongs and Injuries"  Pandosto  was so enraged at this bold and resolute Language that he immediately ordered his Guards to carry the audacious Stranger to Prison and likewise ordered all the Ship's Crew to be put in a close Dungeon For  Fawnia  he ordered an Apartment in the Palace to be prepared and recommended her to the Care of some of the Court Ladies  Dorastus  heard the Order for his Confinement with a contemptuous Silence and followed the Guards without deigning to cast a Look on the enraged King and only by a passionate Glance at  Fawnia  expressed the Anguish of his Soul at being thus torn from her  She with streaming Eyes saw him depart  nd retiring to the Apartment allotted for her  esigned herself up to the deepest Despair and  ontinued wholly insensible of all the Conso  ations that were offered her  Mean Time  Pandosto  in whose old Bosom Love had again kindled a Flame lost no Op  ortunity of seeing the beauteous Stranger  t first he fancied he was only giving Way to  pleasing Amusement when he sought the  ight and Conversation of  Fawnia  but he  oon perceived that she was become necessary  o his Happiness  His restless Anxiety when he was absent  om her his disordered Wishes when with  er the Perturbations of his Mind when he  ought of  Meleagrus  convinced him that  is unknown Virgin had conquered his Heart  e blushed at his own Weakness he reflected  n his advanced Age his exalted Rank on  er Youth Beauty and mean Condition  d sought for Reasons against his yielding to  e Force of his misplaced Passions Reasons  found many but Love was stronger  n them all  In vain he represented to himself that  Fawnia  loved the unknown Knight and that a Heart already prepossessed with a young and amiable Object was not likely to yield to his Sollicitations his Passion seemed to gather Strength from the Obstacles which opposed it and he resolved if Persuasions failed to make Use of all his Power to compel  Fawnia  to his Desires  For this Purpose he sent a Messenger to her one Day when he was walking in a Park behind his Palace to tell her he wanted to speak to her  Fawnia  went to him unwillingly and as she approached the King taking her Hand walked with her a few Steps then stopping suddenly he looked earnestly at her a Moment and thus spoke  "Fawnia  I am charmed with thy  and Beauty I pity thy distrest Situation an  am willing to make thy Fortune provide  thou wilt forsake that despicable Knight wh  brought thee hither He is unworthy  possess an Object so lovely thou art fit for th  Embraces of a King and if thou wilt yie  to be my Mistress I will advance thee bo  to Dignity and Riches"  "I little expected replied  Fawnia  with noble Disdain to hear a Proposal so base a  so unworthy the Majesty of a King fro  Pandosto  Is it for you Sir for one of yo  Dignity and Age to attempt to seduce an u  happy  Virgin whom Fortune and your own Injustice has put into your Power But know my Lord that your Endeavours to engage me from  Meleagrus  are all in vain he won my Heart by honourable Love and he only shall possess it my unhappy Fate drove me into your Dominions where I have been separated from  Meleagrus  and am persecuted by you but these Misfortunes cannot lessen my Love or shake my Constancy True Love like true Virtue gathers Strength and Firmness from Distress No though your Ma  esty has imprisoned my Lover without any Cause contrary to all the Laws of Hospita  ity and Justice and by that Means I am  eft alone and without any Protection in your Court yet think not that the most terrible Threats or most alluring Temptations can make me consent to any Thing that is disho  ourable I have a noble Mind though the Gods have been pleased to cover it with ple  ean Clay I cannot be terrified by Threats  r soothed by Flatteries into a base Compli  nce therefore be assured I would rather  huse to be the Wife of  Meleagrus  and share  ith him the greatest Miseries that cruel For  ne can inflict than be the Concubine of  andosto  and live in all the Splendor he can  estow"  The King though greatly surprized and  rplexed with this resolute Answer of  Faw  a  yet would not give over his Solicitati  s when he found he could not prevail up  her to yield to his Desires by Promises of  Wealth and Grandeur to herself he swore that he would not only set  Meleagrus  at Liberty but that he would confer Honours and Dignities on him and raise him to a Rank equal to the greatest of his Noblemen"  But  Fawnia  replied "that she would not purchase his Liberty ardently as she loved him with the Loss of her Honour" and  Pandosto  seeing her so fixed in her Resolution not to forsake  Meleagrus  would press her no further at that Time and left her to herself  Fawnia  as soon as she was alone began with Sighs and Tears to bewail this new Misfortune which had befallen her anticipating by her Fears the Distresses her Refusal of the King's Offers might bring upon  Dorastus  and herself  "Oh unfortunate  Fawnia  said she how well has thy Presumption in daring to love a Prince been punished by the Calamities thou endurest at present and those greater ones which thou hast Reason to expect Ah fond and inconsiderate Maid hadst thou been contented with the humble Condition of a Shepherdess in which thou wert born thou hadst escaped these Evils but thy rash Folly has not only undone thyself but ruined him whose Happiness is and ought to be dearer to thee than thy own"  "Oh  Dorastus Dorastus  thou who wert born a Prince art now a Prisoner for my Sake those Hands which were formed for Scepters are loaded with shameful Irons for  me unworthy me what Miseries has thy fatal Passion for the wretched  Fawnia  brought upon thee too lovely and too generous Prince thou hadst been still great and happy but for me Oh that by my Death I could free thee from thy unworthy Bonds but alas thy Freedom can only be procured by the Sacrifice of my Honour and that Sacrifice thou wouldst never consent to no my dear Prince 'tis only by my Fidelity to thee that I can requite thy wonderous Love and here I swear by the immortal Gods no Temptations no Threats not even of Death itself shall ever make me forsake thee"  Fawnia  having thus given Vent to the secret Sorrows of her Soul retired to her Apartment in the Palace and past the melancholy Hours in bewailing the Confinement of her beloved Prince and offering up Prayers to the Gods for his Deliverance  Mean Time  Dorastus  in a close Prison loaded with Irons like a common Criminal and now a thousand bitter Reflexions rose in his Mind Rage and Shame at the unworthy Treatment he received made him sometimes regret his ill placed Passion which had brought him into so wretched a Condition  But this Thought seldom dwelt long upon his Mind and he was more ready to accuse the Gods of Cruelty and Injustice for divideing him from  Fawnia  and subjecting him to such Miseries than to repent the Folly that had caused them  Oh wretched  Dorastus  would he cry when assaulted by a vainly supprest Remorse  oughtest thou in Reason to repine at thy Fate are not worse Punishments if possible than what thou now endurest due to thy Unworthiness and Folly couldst thou expect to be favoured by Heaven thou who didst forget the Duties of thy Station and hast disgraced thy Rank and Dignity the Wrath of Heaven is levelled at the Wretch who disobeys his Father and oppresses his old Age with Shame and Sorrow thou hast done this  Dorastus  and mayst with Reason expect the severest Punishments will be inflicted on thee behold me then ye Gods ready to suffer all your Vengeance and willing to expiate my Offence by Death But on me on me only let loose all your Fury spa  e the lovely the innocent  Fawnia  shield and defend her helpless Youth from the inhuman Tyranny of  Pandosto  and if my Death can procure her Safety hasten it ye heavenly Powers and let my Punishment attone for all"  While the two Lovers thus groaned under the cruel Tyranny of  Pandosto  his Passion for  Fawnia  gave him no less Disquiet her Denials instead of abating increased his unlawful Desires his Discontent appeared in every Look and Action so tha  his Courtiers who saw him always disturbed and uneasy wondered from whence the sudden Alteration proceeded  Though the resolute Behaviour of  Fawnia  in the last Interview he had with her gave him no Reason to hope for any Change in her Sentiments yet being impatient to see her again and assail her Virtue with new Sollicitations  he ordered her to be brought privately into his Apartment  Fawnia  with great Reluctance suffered herself to be conducted to his Presence and the King as soon as he saw her ordered all his Attendants to withdraw and with a soothing Look and Voice thus spoke to her  "Well charming  Fawnia  have you considered upon the Purport of my last Conversation with you when we walked together in the Park are you become less obstinate and more wise Will you prefer the Love of a King to the Affection of a miserable Knight I persuade myself you are not so insensible to the Charms of Ambition as not to think it better to be the Favourite of a King than the Wife of a poor Subject"  "My Lord replied  Fawnia  I am sensible that I am in your Power and have indeed severely felt the arbitrary Exertion of it is it just is it reasonable my Lord to inflict upon innocent Persons such Punishments as are only due to guilty ones What Crime has  Meleagrus  committed against you that he must be loaded with Chains and confined in a horrible Prison And what Right have you over my Person that you detain me here in your Palace and force me to listen to your infamous Proposals  Meleagrus  has never attempted to seduce your Subjects from their Allegiance to you why then do you attempt to allure me from the Fidelity I owe to him but know unjust Prince though Fortune has put my Person in your  Power my Mind can never be subdued but disdains alike your Promises and Threats I have vowed to keep myself for my beloved  Meleagrus  and nothing but Death shall prevent my keeping that  Vow"  "Is it possible then said  Pandosto  that you can persist in refusing the Love of a King for the Sake of that wretched Man foolish and ungrateful Girl you say you are in my Power yet I forbear to use it to your Prejudice and what I might compel by Force am contented only to sue for by Prayers yield then and reward my ardent Passion with your Love  Meleagrus  shall be set at Liberty your Countrymen discharged and all that your utmost Wishes can suggest shall be fulfilled by a King who burns in Love for you"  "Why do you talk of Love replied  Fawnia  with a beautiful Disdain you who are a Stranger to that godlike Passion alas 'tis Profanation to call the Inclination you have for me by the Name of Love such Love as yours my Lord is worse than Death to a modest Virgin and to avoid it I will freely sacrifice my Life Well may you threaten me with your Power you who are capable of making so ill an Use of it but know lascivious Prince that all your Power is insufficient to force me to a Crime the Gods abhor and since I dare die to preserve my Honour your impious Attempt will gain you nothing but eternal Infamy"  Pandosto  enraged at her unalterable Love for  Meleagrus  and fixed Resolution to refuse his Offer ordered her with Eyes sparkling with Fury to quit his Presence swearing at the same Time that unless she disposed herself soon to yield to his Desires he would force her to comply whatever might be the Consequences  Fawnia  not in the least terrified at his Menaces quitted his Apartment and retired to her own arming her Soul with Fortitude to escape his threatened Force by Death if Heaven afforded her not some other Means of Relief  In the mean Time the King of  Sicily  was informed by some  Bohemian  Merchants who had discovered  Meleagrus  to be  Dorastus  that his Son was in  Bohemia  and confined in Prison by the King  Egistus  though extremely offended with his Son for his Disobedience and Desertion of him yet could not hear of the shameful Treatment he received from  Pandosto  without feeling great Affliction and reflecting that  Bellaria  and himself had been cleared by the Oracles of  Apollo  of the Crime the King suspected them guilty of he did not doubt but  Pandosto  would send back his fugitive Son at the Request of his Ambassadors  He therefore ordered a small Fleet well manned to be prepared and giving a Commission to some of his principal Nobles to demand  the Prince of  Pandosto  they embarked and set sail for  Bohemia  Pandosto  received the  Sicilian  Ambassadors with great Respect which filled them with Hopes of returning to their Master with Success and soon after their Arrival related to them the Adventure of the  Trapalonian  Knight who he said had come into his Dominions in a very suspicious Manner bringing with him a young Lady named  Fawnia  and no Attendants but a Shepherd and an old Man  The Ambassadors immediately perceived this  Trapalonian  Knight was no other than their Prince  Dorastus  but they dissembled the Matter for the present till the King granted them a public Audience and then in the Name of their Sovereign they demanded the Prince of  Sicily  of him who was in his Dominions under the Name of  Meleagrus  They then proceeded to acquaint his  Bohemian  Majesty that the Prince of  Sicily  had contrary to the Will of the King his Father quitted the Kingdom and carried with him a young Maid named  Fawnia  the Daughter of an old Shepherd called  Porrus  and that  Capnio  one of the Prince's Attendants had accompanied him in his Flight  They concluded with telling the King that it was the Request of their Sovereign  Egistus  that Prince  Dorastus  should be freed from his Confinement and sent home with them and  that  Capnio Porrus  and his Daughter  Fawnia  should be put to Death  Pandosto  heard this Embassy with great Astonishment and willing to reconcile himself to  Egistus  and to shew how much he desired to renew their long interrupted Friendship he resolved punctually to execute his Will and to sacrifice  Fawnia  both to his Policy and his injured Love  He therefore sent Orders immediately for the Release of  Dorastus  who was greatly surprized at this unexpected Favour but he was still more so when being conducted into the King's Presence he saw several Noblemen belonging to his Father's Court who as soon as he appeared approached and paid their Duties to him with the utmost Respect  Pandosto  rising from his Chair of State embraced him with many Expressions of Tenderand Respect mingling Apologies for what had passed while his Birth and Quality were unknown then seating him on his right Hand he declared to him the Purport of the Embassy he had received from the King his Father  Dorastus  in great Confusion to find the Cause of his Flight was thus publickly known held down his Head to hide the Blushes which overspread his Face but when the King went on to relate the Punishment that he was required to inflict upon  Fawnia  and that other Partners of his Flight he was not able to conceal the strong Emotions of his  Soul but in the most passionate Terms he exclaimed against the Cruelty and Injustice of his Father and earnestly conjured  Pandosto  not to execute so inhuman a Sentence  The King without being moved by his Intreaties ordered  Fawnia Capnio  and  Porrus  to be brought before him and giving Way to the Fury of his Resentment against  Fawnia  whose noble Resistance had changed the Former Love he bore her into Hatred he accosted the trembling Maid with these reproachful Words  "Mean and contemptible Wretch said he how durst thou raise thy dazled Eyes to Honour and in thy base born Soul nourish the Flames of Ambition Was it for thee thou Beggar to entertain Hopes of marrying a Prince and practise Arts to induce the Son of a great King to forsake his Country to gratify thy insolent Desires but know thou dangerous Syren Death shall be the Reward of thy daring Ambition and thou old doating Fool said he to the pale trembling  Porrus  whose insolent Folly has prompted thy Daughter to this rash Undertaking thy Life shall pay for thy Presumption"  "But for thee  Capnio  added the enraged King Death is too easy a Punishment thy Treason and Falshood merits something worse I therefore condemn thee to have thy Eyes put out and till thou diest grind continually in a Mill like a blind Horse"  Dorastus  whom the Sentence that was past on  Fawnia  had thrown into a silent Agony of Grief Rage and Despair perceiving they were about to lead her away rose up to speak in her Defence but overcome with the Violence of these different Emotions he sunk down again in his Chair without any Appearance of Life  By the timely Assistance of the King's Physicians he recovered his Senses and at their Instances he was removed from the Sight of  Fawnia  who as soon as he was taken out of the Room spoke in this Manner  "If my Death will be the Means of procuring Peace and Happiness for Prince  Dorastus  who is my betrothed Lord and whose sacred Vows the Gods have heard and registered in Heaven and which no Power on Earth can dissolve I am then content to die but my innocent and tender Passion for him I shall carry to my Grave my last Breath shall be spent in begging Blessings for him in imploring the Gods to shed their choicest Gifts upon him that when he succeeds to the Throne of his Father he may rule his Subjects with Prudence Equity and Moderation for Wisdom and Mercy are divine Attributes and a Monarch's true Safety and Happiness consists in the Love and not the Fear of his People Behold me then O King prepared to suffer all the Rigour of your Sentence But oh my Father what has he done that his gray and venerable Hairs must  by Violence be brought to the Grave alas he is absolutely innocent of the Engagement between the Prince and me he neither counsel'd my Flight nor consented to accompany me in it but was brought forcibly on board the Ship and compelled to be the Partner of our Voyage must he then die for an involuntary Crime Oh unjust and cruel Destiny But who art thou King  Pandosto  who judgest thus the Subjects of another King who not having committed any Thing worthy of Punishment since they came into thy Territories hast nevertheless passed Sentence of Death upon them But something within me says thou hast a Power to judge  Fawnia  be it so then and welcome Death which will bring me to those Regions of Bliss where eternal Justice Mercy and Compassion reigns  The old Shepherd moved with the affectionate Entreaties of  Fawnia  in his Favour and perceiving there was no more Hope of Life resolved before he died to discover that she was not his Daughter and after entreating a few Moments Audience spoke thus  "King of  Bohemia  and ye noble Ambassadors of  Sicily  seeing that I am though innocent condemned to die I am willing to disburthen my Conscience of a Secret I have too long concealed I will tell ye as much as I know and no more than is true  Fawnia  who has been disdained as a vile Beggar is not my Daughter I found her and thus it happened Being a poor Shepherd in  Sicily  and living by keeping other Mens Flocks upon a  certain Day one of my Sheep straying down to the Seaside I went to look for it and saw a little Boat driven upon the Sands wherein I found a Babe about six Days old wrapt in a scarlet Mantle with a Chain about its Neck Compassion moved me to take Care of the Child and being covetous of the Treasure I had found with it I carried it home to my Wife who nursed it as her own and when it grew up set it to keep Sheep this Lady  Fawnia  is the Child whom I found and here is the Chain and the Jewels that were about her who she is and of what Parentage I know not but I solemnly declare she is not mine"  Pandosto  who had with Difficulty restrained his Emotions while  Porrus  war speaking as soon as he was silent impatiently demanded to know the Season of the Year when he found this Babe the Boat in which it was laid and several other Circumstances and fully satisfied with his Answers he suddenly sprung from his Seat and in a Rapture of paternal Affection he catched  Fawnia  in his Arms bathing her tender Face which he pressed close to his own with Tears of Surprize and Joy and crying in broken Accents "Oh  Fawnia  my long lost Daughter I am thy Father  Fawnia"  These Exclamations and sudden Passion filled all that were present with Amazement especially  Fawnia  who stood motionless with Surprize her lovely Face expressing at once the Extremes of Joy Hope Fear and Wonder  Pandosto  as soon as the first Violence of his Transports was abated sent for  Dor  stus  who was by this Time perfectly restored to his Senses and holding  Fawnia  by the Hand he declared that she was his Daughter of whom his Wife  Bellaria  had been delivered while she lay under the false Suspicion of Adultery and was therefore by his Orders exposed in an open Boat to the Fury of the Waves He then ordered  Porrus  to tell the Prince where he had found her and his Relation finished he again embraced her and publicly acknowledged her for his Daughter  Fawnia  now assured of the Reality of her Happiness indulged her Joy at this unexpected good Fortune Dorastus was transported out of himself and the  Sicilians  no longer repined at their Prince's Choice but rejoiced in the Expectation that the Enmity which had so long subsisted between  Egistus  and  Pandosto  would now be changed into a firm Friendship and perpetual Peace between the Kingdoms of  Sicily  and  Bohemia  The News was soon spread through  Pandosto  's Dominions the Streets rung with Exclamations of Joy for the King's having found his Daughter and that there was now a lawful Heir to the Crown of  Bohemia  nothing but magnificent Shews were every where to be seen and the most extravagant Demonstrations of Joy  The King conferred the Honour of Knighthood on old  Porrus  who had been so long the reputed Father of  Fawnia  and causing a noble Fleet to be put in readiness to sail he embarked with  Dorastus Fawnia  and the  Sicilian  Ambassadors with a numerous Retinue and soon arrived at  Sicily  where he was kindly received by  Egistus  who was perfectly satisfied with his Son's Fortune  The nuptial Ceremonies between the Prince and Princess were performed with great Magnificence and soon after  Pandosto  giving way to a thousand gloomy Reflexions which the Consideration of his unjust Jealousy of  Bellaria  his designed Cruelty to  Egistus  but above all his unnatural Passion for his Daughter had inspired a deep Melancholy seized his Spirits which turning to a Phrenzy he one Night took Advantage of the Absence of his Attendants and stabbed himself with a Dagger  His Death was much lamented by  Dorastus Fawnia  and the good  Egistus  his Body being embalmed the young King and Queen of  Bohemia  took Leave of the King of  Sicily  their Father and carried the Corpse of the deceased Monarch with them to  Bohemia  where the funeral Obsequies were performed with great Splendor and they ascended the Throne to the universal Joy of the whole Kingdom  OBSERVATIONS  on the Use  Shakespear  has made of the foregoing Novel in his Play called The  Winter's Tale  The Fable of the  WINTER's TALE  POLIXENES  King of  Bohemia  and  Leontes  King of  Sicilia  having been bred together in their Youth and maintained a strict Friendship and Correspondence with each other after they succeeded to the Thrones of their Fathers  Polixenes  desirous of seeing again his beloved Companion pays him a Visit in his own Dominions where after staying a considerable Time he proposes to take Leave and return to his own Kingdom but  Leontes  unwilling to part with him presses him to a lon  er Stay  Polixenes  refuses whereupon  Leontes  desires his Queen  Hermione  to solicit him she obeys and  Polixenes  at her Request consents to remain a little longer in  Bohemia  Leontes  takes Occasion from the Earnestness of his Wife's Entreaties and the easy Compliance of  Polixenes  to suspect them both  f Adultery and growing furious with Jea  ousy he endeavours to persuade  Camillo  one  of his Courtiers whom he had made CupBearer to  Polixenes  to poison him  Camillo  promises to perform his Orders but secretly discovers them to the King of  Bohemia  who thus warned makes his Escape by Night accompanied by his Preserver  Camillo  Leontes  enraged at their Flight and supposing that his Queen was privy to it publicly accuses her of Adultery with  Polixenes  and of conspiring with  Camillo  to take away his Life  Hermione  is sent to Prison where she is delivered of a Daughter  Paulina  an old Lady Friend to the Queen carries the Child to  Leontes  who swears it is a Bastard and threatens to have both it and the Mother burnt being with Difficulty dissuaded from this cruel Resolution he orders  Antigonous  the Husband of  Paulina  to carry the Child to some desert Place quite out of his Dominions and there leave it  Antigonous  being instructed in a Dream how to dispose of it carries it into  Bohemia  and leaves it in a Wood but as he is returning to his Vessel he is devoured by a wild Bear and the Ship is wrecked  Leontes  having sent Messengers to  Delpho  to consult the Oracle of  Apollo  concerning hi  Queen's Infidelity as soon as they return th  Queen is brought to her Trial and her Accusation  being read which she courageously denies and refers to the Oracle it is broke open and read aloud and pronounces her Inher Inocence  The King declares the Oracle is false and orders the Court to proceed in the Tryal when a Messenger brings him an Account of the sudden Death of the Prince his Son the Queen falls into a Swoon at this News and is carried out  Leontes  believing the Death of his Son to be a Punishment for his Profanation in denying the Truth of the Oracle repents his unjust Accusation of  Hermione  asks Pardon of  Apollo  and resolves to make his Queen Amends for the Injuries he had offered her  While he is making these penitent Resolutions  Paulina  enters and informs him the Queen is dead  Leontes  in great Affliction vows to visit her Tomb once in every Day while he lives and weep ever it  In the mean Time the little  Perdita  his Daughter is found by a  Bohemian  Shepherd who breeds it up as his own Child Prince  Florizel  the Son of  Polixenes  falls in love with  Perdita  and resolves to marry her The King his Father discovers his Intention and threatens  Perdita  with Death if she ever again presumes to receive his Son's Addresses  Camillo  who ardently desired to visit his own Country  Sicilia  and his old Master  Leontes  persuades Prince  Florizel  since he was determined not to quit  Perdita  to steal her away and carry her to  Sicilia  and feign an Embassy from his Father to  Leontes  which would secure him a kind Reception  Florizel  goes on board a Ship with  Perdita  and sails to  Sicilia  where he is received with great Friendship by  Leontes  but immediately after King  Polixenes  himself arrives having been persuaded by  Camillo  to follow his Son and prevent his Marriage with  Perdita  The supposed Father of  Perdita  having been decoyed on board the Prince's Vessel as he was going to the King to discover how he came by  Perdita  and to show him the Tokens he found with her she is by his Means discovered to be the Daughter of  Leontes  Paulina  overjoyed at this happy Discovery invites the two Kings with the Prince and Princess to her House to see a Statue of  Hermione  which she says is just finished they follow her and she shews them  Hermione  herself who they supposed dead standing upon  Pedestal after they have gazed on her some Time still thinking it was a Statue of the deceased Queen  Paulina  orders the Music to play and bids the Statue descend which it does and is discovered to be the living  Hermione  Leontes  receives her again with Transport Prince  Florizel  is married to his beloved  Perdita  and the good old  Paulina  is rewarded with another Husband in the Room of her lost  Antigonous  It has been mentioned as a great Praise to  Shakespear  that the old paltry Story of  Dorastus  and  Fawnia  served him for a Winter's Tale but if we compare the Conduct of the Incidents in the Play with the paltry Story on which it is founded we shall find the Original much less absurd and ridiculous  If  Shakespear  had even improved the Story and cleared it of great Part of its Inconsistencies yet he would still have been accountable for what remained for why indeed did he chuse a Subject so faulty for the Story of a Play his Claim to Praise would have been but very small by making what was bad better since he was free in the Choice of his Subject but certainly he can have no Pretensions to it at all by changing bad to worse that he has done so will be easily proved by examining some of the principal Incidents as they are differently managed by the Novelist and the Poet  The King's Jealousy is the Foundation of all the Adventures that followed but extravagant as its Consequences are in both yet the Rise and Progress of this terrible Passion is better accounted for in the Novel than the Play In the first we are told that  Pandosto  charmed with the friendly Visit  Egistus  paid him in his Dominions desired the Queen to  treat her royal Guest with the Respect and Esteem that was due to his Merit and the Friendship he had for him the Queen like an obedient Wife complies with her Husband's Directions and perhaps overacts her Part The King begins to think he has been too officious the innocent Familiarity between his Wife and Friend creates Suspicions which meeting with a Mind prepared by a natural Distrustfulness to receive them produces those Sparks of Jealousy which his interested Observations on all their Looks Words and Actions afterwards blew into a Flame  This Account of the King's Jealousy does not absolutely clash with Probability But let us see how  Shakespear  manages it in the Play the two Kings make their first Appearance in the second Scene in high Friendship and Confidence  Polixenes  reminding his Friend of the Length of his Visit tells him he is now resolved to be gone  Leontes  not able to part with him presses him earnestly to stay longer  Polixenes  urges the Necessity of his speedy Departure and truly as he observes nine Months is a great while for a good King to be out of his own Dominions  Leontes  after many fruitless Intreaties reproaches his Queen for not endeavouring to detain  Polixenes  she in obedience to his Commands presses him to gratify her Lord by a  little longer Stay  Polixenes  complies at her Request and certainly he must be a very ill bred Monarch had he done otherwise  All this Conversation passes in the Presence of  Leontes  who from hence takes Occasion to be jealous and passes in an Instant from the greatest Confidence Security and Friendship imaginable to the last Extremity of Jealousy and Rage What wonderful Contrivance is here The Legerdemain who shews you a Tree that buds Blossoms and bears ripe Fruit in the Space of five Minutes does not put so great a Cheat on the Senses as  Shakespear  does on the Understanding for this Jealousy of one Minute's Growth we see take Root before our Eyes and so far from there being the smallest Progression in the several Actions of budding blossoming and bearing ripe Fruit that we have the first and the last at one and the same Instant  The extravagant Effects of the King's Rage and Jealousy are carried far enough in all Conscience in the Novel and  Shakespear  is not a Whit more moderate only he has altered a Circumstance which entirely destroys the little Probability the Novelist had preserved in the Relation  In the Story the King being in his own Mind firmly persuaded of the Queen's Guilt  rders her to be imprisoned and the Daughter  at she was delivered of in Prison to be burnt  the Intreaties of his Courtiers he reverses  the Sentence past on the Child and commands it to be exposed in a Boat but declares that his Queen shall die  She insists upon being confronted with her Accusers whereupon she is brought to a Tryal but finding she was likely to meet with no Justice in a Court overruled by the Power of her Husband she on her Knees protests her Innocence and intreats the King to consult the Oracle of  Apollo  concerning the Crimes of which she was accused This so reasonable a Request being made in open Court the King could not refuse it and therefore sends Ambassadors to  Delphos  who return with the Answer of the God which being read declares her Innocence and the King is satisfied  Shakespear  makes the King in the Heighth of his Frenzy of Jealousy send himself to the Oracle of  Apollo  and in the mean Time commit the most barbarous Cruelties on his Queen and Child How inconsistent is this why does he consult the Oracle if he is resolved to proceed to Extremities before the Answer arrives The Request comes very naturally from the Queen in the Novel and the King's Compliance with it is very well accounted for but in the Play nothing can be more absurd than that the King should be reasonable enough to consult voluntarily the Gods concerning the Infidelity of his Wife and while the Answer was expected and her Guilt yet doubtful punish her with as much Rigour as if the Oracle had declared her an Adultress Her  again the paltry Story has the Advantage of the Play Let us go on to examine a few more of the Incidents  In the Novel the Persons who perform the hateful Office of exposing the Infant Princess are some of the King's Guards  In the Play it is a Nobleman of high Rank who had Courage enough to reprove the King for his violent and unjust Jealousy yet basely submits to take an Oath to perform his Commands though he had Reason to think they would not be very mild and still more basely keeps that Oath though it enjoins him to carry the innocent Babe to a Desert and there leave it to the Mercy of the wild Beasts  In the Novel the Accidents that happen to the exposed Infant are governed by Chance the Boat into which it was put being left in the midst of the Ocean is driven by the Winds to the Coast of  Bohemia  and being spied by a Shepherd is drawn to Land  In the Play  Antigonous  who is bound by Oath to leave the Child in some desert Place quite out of its Father's Dominions is warned in a Dream by its unhappy Mother to call the Infant  Perdita  and carry it to  Bohemia  and there leave it  Antigonous  obeys and this done it is absolutely necessary he should never return to  Sicily  otherwise it may be discovered where the Princess is left and all the future Adventures would fall to the Ground therefore a Bear rushes out of the Woods and devours  him the goodnatured Bear as it should seem resolved not to spoil the Story passes by the little Princess who is to make so great a Figure hereafter and a convenient Storm arising splits the Ship in which she was brought thither so that all the Sailors perishing though they were near enough the Shore to have saved themselves no one is left to ca  ry back any Account of the Affair to  Sicily  and thereby prevent the Adventures which are to follow  All this is very wonderful  Shakespear  multiplies Miracle upon Miracle to bring about the same Events in the Play which Chance with much more Propriety performs in the Novel  The Loves of the young Prince of  Bohemia  and the royal Shepherdess are carried on much in the same Manner by the Poet as the Novelist  Shakespear  has even borrowed some of the Thoughts from the latter in this Speech of  Florizel  to  Perdita  The Gods themselves  Humbling their Deities to Love have taken  The Shapes of Beasts upon them  Jupiter  Became a Bull and bellow'd the Green  Neptune  A Ram and bleated and the firerob'd God  Golden  Apollo  a poor humble Swain  As I seem now Their Transformations  Were never for a Piece of Beauty rarer  Nor in a Way so chaste Since my Desires  Run not before my Honour nor my Lusts  Burn hotter than my Faith  Dorastus  speaks almost the same Words in the Novel "The Gods themselves have not disdained to love  Jupiter  was enamoured of  Danaë  and the bright  Apollo  woo'd the inexorable  Daphne  these were mortal Beauties and they were Deities why then though a Prince may not I love a Shepherdess but their Passions were dishonourable mine is pure and chaste 'tis true and herein I surpass the Gods be still then O my Soul for 'tis decreed  Fawnia  the adorable  Fawnia  shall be mine"  The Escape of the two Lovers is very differently managed in the Novel and Play in the first the Prince being pressed by his Father to marry resolves to leave  Sicily  with  Fawnia  and fly into  Italy  where he intended to live concealed till his Father's Death or that he could reconcile him to his Marriage with the beautiful Shepherdess having procured a Ship and a sufficient Quantity of Money and Jewels he meets  Fawnia  early in the Morning and carries her to the Port they embark and steer their Course for  Italy  but are driven by contrary Winds to  Bohemia  where they are obliged to land  In the Play  Florizel  disguised in the Habit of a Shepherd for the Sake of  Perdita  assists at a Sheepshearing Feast The King his Father being informed of his Son's Resort to the House of a Shepherd goes there disguised with his Confidant  Camillo  and comes  very opportunely to hear the Prince his Son declare his Passion for the Fair Shepherdess publicly and his Intentions of marrying her nay he carries his Indiscretion so far as to join Hands with her before all the Country People who are present can any Thing be more absurd  The King sufficiently informed of his Son's Designs discovers himself and forbids the Bans this is indeed a terrible Stroke one would be puzzled to think how the Lovers will escape for is it not natural to suppose that the enraged King will keep his Son in a strict Confinement to prevent this unequal Match but it happens quite otherwise for the King after some severe Menaces goes back to his Palace and leaves his Son at Liberty to run away with the Country Girl which he accordingly does  The Part  Camillo  acts in this Affair is not more consistent he longs to see again his old Master  Leontes  and his native Country  Sicilia  which he had quitted to preserve  Polixenes  and because this Monarch loved him so well that he could not bear his Absence and gently denied him Permission to go  Camillo  betrays the Confidence he reposed in him consents to the Prince's Flight and advises him to take Refuge in  Sicilia  in Hopes that  Polixenes  to whom he intended to discover where the Prince was gone would follow him and thus he might again return to his own Country  This double Treachery and selfinterested Views are very inconsistent with the Character  of so honest a Man as  Camillo  is represented to be besides the Contrivance is absolutely ridiculous for what Reason had the Prince to suppose that  Leontes  who passionately desired to be reconciled to the King his Father whom he had so greatly injured would offend him anew by protecting his Son who had fled from him in order to marry a poor Shepherdess for he could not expect the Story however he disguised it would be long concealed from him and why should  Camillo  suppose that  Polixenes  when he was informed of his Son's Flight would quit his Dominions to follow him and put his Person again in the Power of a King who had once designed to murder him was it not more likely that he would send Ambassadors to demand the Prince of  Leontes  who would then have an Opportunity of shewing if his Penitence was sincere by sending him back again but  Shakespear  has fallen into all these Absurdities in order to bring the chief Characters in his Play together at  Sicilia  tho' for some of them there was not the least Occasion  The several Incidents that lead to the Discovery of  Fawnia  are conducted with some Shadow of Probability in the Novel but are much the worse for  Shakespear  's Alterations  In the Novel  Capnio  the Prince's Confidant as he is hastening after him to the Port meets the Father of  Fawnia  going to Court  and suspecting his Design he artfully persuades him to follow him and partly by Stratagem and partly by Force carries him on board the Vessel in which the Prince and  Fawnia  were embarked the old Man had taken with him when he left his House the Chain and Jewels he found with  Fawnia  in order to shew them to the King and relate the Manner in which he found her but being prevented in this Design by  Capnio  who obliged him to be the Companion of their Flight he very prudently continues to conceal from  Fawnia  the Circumstance of her Birth and to secure to himself a respectful Treatment from the Prince and her suffers her still to believe him her Father but when at  Bohemia  the King of  Sicilia  's Ambassadors discover who they are and the old Shepherd and  Fawnia  are by the King of  Bohemia  ordered to be put to Death for deluding the Prince of  Sicily  he then declares that  Fawnia  is not his Daughter and produces the Chain and Jewels he found with her as Proofs that her Birth was not mean the King at the Sight of these Tokens knows and acknowledges his Daughter  Thus these Circumstances are altered by  Shakespear  The Prince having changed Cloaths with a cheating Pedlar escapes with his Mistress to the Ship the Pedlar immediately overhears a Conversation between the reputed Father of  Perdita  and his Son in which it is resolved that he shall carry the Jewels to the King and declare how he found  Perdita  the Pedlar supposing it would be an  Advantage to the Prince to know this decoys the old Shepherd and his Son aboard now one would imagine that all must come out but see what strange Accidents conspire to hinder it  The Pedlar though he overheard the old Shepherd say that  Perdita  was a Foundling and not his Daughter neglects to tell the Prince this important Circumstance though it was with that very Design he came and forced the two Clowns along with him  Perdita  though her Father and Brother are in the same Vessel with her never sees or speaks to them the old Shepherd and his Son make no Attempts to speak to her and the Prince has so little Consideration for the Father and Brother of his Beloved that he takes no Notice of them how wonderful is all this the most unlikely Things imaginable fall out to postpone the Discovery of  Perdita  till their Arrival at  Sicily  The Novel makes the Wife of the jealous King die through Affliction for the Loss of her Son  Shakespear  seems to have preserved her alive for the sake of her representing her own Statue in the last Scene a mean and absurd Contrivance for how can it be imagined that  Hermione  a virtuous and affectionate Wife would conceal herself during sixteen Years in a solitary House though she was sensible that  er repentant Husband was all that Time consuming  away with Grief and Remorse for her Death and what Reason could she have for chusing to live in such a miserable Confinement when she might have been happy in the Possession of her Husband's Affection and have shared his Throne how ridiculous also in a great Queen on so interresting an Occasion to submit to such Buffoonery as standing on a Pedestal motionless her Eyes fixed and at last to be conjured down by this magical Command of  Paulina  Music awake her strike  'Tis Time descend be Stone no more approach  Strike all that look upon with Marvel Come  I'll fill your Grave up stir nay come away  Bequeath to Death your Numbness for from him  Dear Life redeems you  After this solemn Incantation her Majesty comes down from the Pedestal and embraces her Husband and her new found Daughter for whose Sake she declares she had preserved her Life  To bring about this Scene ridiculous as it is  Shakespear  has been guilty of many Absurdities which would be too tedious to mention and which are too glaring to escape the Observation of the most careless Reader  The Novel has nothing in it half so low and improbable as this Contrivance of the  Statue and indeed wherever  Shakespear  has altered or invented his  Winter  's  Tale  is greatly inferior to the old paltry Story that furnished him with the Subject of it  Sir  Thomas Hanmer  in his Edition of  Shakespear  has this Note at the Beginning of the  Winter Tale  This Country here called  Bithynia  hath in all former Editions been printed  Bohemia  an inland Kingdom situated nearly in the Center of  Europe  whereas many of the great Incidents of the Play turn upon its being a maritime Country of which  Polixenes  was the King This is a Blunder and an Absurdity of which  Shakespear  in Justice ought not to be thought capable and as he hath turned quite anew the Story contained in the old paltry Book of  Dorastus  and  Fawnia  changing most of the main Circumstances and all the Names of the Persons it is probable he removed this Impropriety and placed the Scene in  Bithynia  which the Ignorance and Negligence of the first Transcribers or Printers might corrupt and bring back again to  Bohemia  by a less Variation in the Letters than they have been guilty of in numberless other Places of this Work  Shakespear  in his Two Gentlemen of  Verona  makes  Protheus  travel from  Verona  to  Milan  by Sea Yet both those Cities are inland and both more than eighty Miles distant from the Sea Unless this Blunder can be also charged upon the Transcribers or Printers 'tis reasonable to suppose that  Shakespear  who was guilty of the one might be so of the other  THE MENAECHMI A COMEDY of  PLAUTUS  Translated from the  French  OF Monsieur GUEUDIVILLE  The PERSONS  The PROLOGUE  Menaechmus  of  Epidamnum  Son of  Moschus  and  Theusimarcha  and Brother of  Sosicles  An old Man Father of the Wife of  Menaechmus  of  Epidamnum  The Wife of  Menaechmus  of  Epidamnum  Erotia  the Mistress of  Menaechmus  of  Epidamnum  Physician  Peniculus  Parasite of  Menaechmus  of  Epidamnum  A Servant of  Menaechmus  of  Epidamnum  Slaves  Cylindrus  Cook to  Menaechmus  of  Epidamnum  and  Erotia  Menaechmus Sosicles  Brother to  Menaechmus  of  Epidamnum  Messenion  Slave of  Menaechmus Sosicles  The EPILOGUE  SCENE  Epidamnum  in  Macedonia  PROLOGUE  I Begin Gentlemen with telling you that I wish you all as well as myself here is a Comedy of  Plautus  which I bring you and intreat you will give it a favourable Attention listen now to the Subject of the Play and be silent I shall endeavour to comprise it in as few Words as possible  'Tis customary with Poets in their Comedies to make one believe that all passes at  Athens  to the End that the Subject may appear entirely  Grecian  and may be more esteemed by the Spectators as for me I shall not pretend to say that what we are going to represent here to Day happened in any other Place than where it really did  The Subject of this Piece is truly  Grecian  yet notwithstanding that it is not  Attick  but  Sicilian  and what I have hitherto said is only the Introduction to it  In explaining the Argument to you I shall not amuse myself with shewing you Patterns only but present you with the whole Piece for it is my Intention to be very full in the Exposition of this Intrigue  There was formerly at  Syracuse  a good plain simple Man a Merchant by Profession his Wife was delivered of two Sons at one Birth who so perfectly resembled each other that the Nurse who suckled them and the Mother who bore them were not able to distinguish the one from the other This I was told by a Person who saw them for my own Part I never did see them and I tell you so that you may not be deceived  When these two Children arrived to the Age of seven Years their Father took one of them with him on board a Vessel which he had loaded with Merchandize and carried him to  Tarentum  whither he went to trade leaving the other at home with his Mother  It happened that when they arrived at  Tarentum  they were celebrating Games which as it is usual with public Spectacles drew together great Numbers of People  The little Boy straying from his Father was taken up by a Merchant of  Epidamnum  who carried him into his own Country the Father's Affliction for the Loss of his Son was so great that it deprived him of his Senses and a few Days after of his Life  This News being carried to  Syracuse  the Grandfather of the two Children understanding that one of them was taken away at  Tarentum  and that the Father was dead changed the Name of his Grandson who remained with him and gave him that of his Brother that was lost whom he had loved extremely and was desirous of preserving the Remembrance  of he called him therefore  Menaechmus  a Name that was common to himself as well as to the Twins  This Circumstance I remember very well having heard it proclaimed by the public Criers and that you may avoid Mistakes I inform you beforehand that these twin Brothers have both the same Name  But I must now return to  Epidamnum  Is there any one among you who has Occasion for any Thing from that Country If there be he needs only to speak and command me freely however he must understand that it will be necessary to give me Money to enable me to perform his Commission for to give me no Money would be a very great Folly and to give me Money a still greater I return then to the Place from whence I came nevertheless I do not budge from this Spot  This Merchant of  Epidamnum  of whom I have spoken so much and who took away one of the twin Brothers had no Children but in every Thing else he was very rich he adopted therefore the stolen Child bred him up as his own Son married him to a Woman with a large Fortune and made a Will by which he left him his whole Estate One Day when he went into the Country  t rained violently and being obliged to pass a very rapid River not far from the City the Force of the Stream carried away this Ravisher  of Children and hurried him to the Furies in Spite of his Teeth  Behold now the young Man established a  Epidamnum  in Possession of a great Fortune his Brother brought up at  Syracuse  is this Da  arrived at  Epidamnum  with his Servant it Search of this other Brother for this Reason the City of  Epidamnum  will be the Scene of this Comedy when we play another the Scene also shall be changed for you know the Subjects are not always the same sometimes we play a Merchant of Slaves sometimes a young Debauchee sometimes a poor Man a Beggar a King a Parasite or a Fortuneteller  THE MENAECHMI of  Plautus  ACT I  SCENE I  PENICULUS  the Parasite  _THE Name of  Peniculus  which I bear was given me by the young People of the City because when I am at Table I know so well how to make it clean Th  se Masters who load their fugitive Slaves with Chains are in my Opinion guilty of great Folly for a poor Wretch who sees a new Evil added to those he suffered before is but the more incited to commit new Rogueries and to avoid Punishment by Flight these People never fail of extricating themselves out of Difficulties Sometimes they force open the  Lock with a File sometimes they break the Hinges of the Door with a Stone all the Precautions one takes with them are useless the best Way to prevent a Servant from flying is to attach them to one's self by good Nourishment tye these Sort of Animals to a good Rack and give them Plenty of Provender and take my Word for it they will not run away whatever Fault they have committed they may be easily guarded if you make use of these Chains to retain them the Ligaments of the Jaws are so pliant that the more they are stretched the closer they may be drawn  For a Proof of this I am going to the House of  Menaechmus  to get myself tyed in this Manner and voluntary submit to a Sentence which has been long ago passed upon me  Menaechmus  is a Man who not only feeds People well but even gives them a new Birth and new Life he is the first Man in the World for performing wonderful Cures he is blest with a noble Appetite himself you would say that each of his Repasts is a Feast so well he knows how to furnish a Table there is nothing to be seen on all Sides but Pyramids of Dishes so that if one wants any Thing from the other End of the Table one is obliged to raise one's self quite up from the Bed to reach it  I have been many Days absent from him during which Time I have remained shut up at home with my dear little Family for I cannot eat or drink any Thing that does not cost me very dear therefore I am sometimes obliged to fast for Want of Money I am now going to visit  Menaechmus  but his Door opens'tis himself who is coming out  SCENE II  MENAECHMUS  of  Epidamnum PENICULUS  MENAECHMUS  to his Wife  within  If you were not foolish and unreasonable to the last Degree you wou'd not have a Mind at once so stubborn and so weak it ought to be sufficient that a Thing does not please your Husband to make it unpleasing also to you but be assured if you ever take the Liberties with me which you have just now done I will send you back to your Father and never see you more When I have an Inclination to go abroad you always endeavour to detain me call me back enquire where I am going what I intend to do what Affairs I have to transact from home what I want what I carry out with me what I do when I am out in short I have a Tutor instead of a Wife to whom I am obliged to give an exact Account of all my Actions I have hitherto had too much Indulgence for you but do not imagine will have it for the future when I give you in Abundance whatever you can desire Servants Jewels rich Cloaths  ll your Wishes can aim at you ought if  ou were wise to enjoy this Happiness and  ease to be continually watching your Hus  and but that you may not do it to no Pur  ose this Time I shall inform you myself that  I design to have a Rendezvous with a Mistress and am now going to take her with me to Supper at an appointed Place  PENICULUS  This Man is persuaded he has vexed his Wife heartily when at the same Time it is I who suffer for if he sups abroad I shall be disappointed and not his Wife  MENAECHMUS  Most glorious Triumph my Noise has obliged my Wife to retire Where are the intriguing Husbands why come they not in Crouds to load me with Presents and congratulate me on my Dexterity in drawing myself out of Difficulties I have contrived to take away this Robe from my Wife and am going to carry it to my Mistress 'tis thus we ought to trait those inquisitive Dames who are continually prying into all our Affairs Yes I am ready to prove to any one who shall deny it tha  this Exploit of mine is fine equitable pleasant and cunningly performed at my own Expence I have robb'd one wicked Woma  to make a Present to another who is quite a bad I have at least however the Glory and Pleasure of spoiling my Enemies to enrich my Allies  PENICULUS  But pray tell me  Menaechmus  wha  Share of the Spoil have you destin'd fo  me  MENAECHMUS  Ah Wretch that I am I am lost I am fallen into an Ambuscade  PENICULUS  No no quite the contrary you have met with a Reinforcement  MENAECHMUS  Who is there  PENICULUS  'Tis I  MENAECHMUS  Oh the most convenient the most favourable of all my Friends good Morrow  Peniculus  PENICULUS  Good Morrow incomparable Patron  MENAECHMUS  Well what News hast thou to tell me  PENICULUS  Delightful Meeting I hold my tutelary Genius by the Hand  MENAECHMUS  Thou could'st never have come more conveniently  PENICULUS  'Tis my Custom I never fail to present myself in the most seasonable Moments  MENAECHMUS  Are you desirous of hearing a noble Exploit  PENICULUS  Who is the Cook that has prepared the Meats Shew me if you please what remains I shall then be able to judge if he has succeeded well or ill  MENAECHMUS  Tell me hast thou never seen painted in  Fresco  upon Walls the Rape of  Ganymede  by the Eagle of  Jupiter  who was in Love with the fair Boy or that of the charming  Adonis  by  Venus  whose Heart he had conquered  PENICULUS  One sees nothing else every where but pray what are these Pictures to me Alas these Things are the least of my Concerns  MENAECHMUS  Look on me well whom do you think I perfectly resemble  PENICULUS  What Sort of Dress is this that you appear in  MENAECHMUS  Confess to me that my Mien is excellent and that in this Dress I appear to great Advantage  PENICULUS  Where shall we sup  MENAECHMUS  Answer my Question first  PENICULUS  You are in the Right therefore I say you are one of the handsomest Men in the World  MENAECHMUS  Hast thou not Courage enough to add something of thine own  PENICULUS  Certainly I say then that you are a most agreeable Man  MENAECHMUS  Go on go on  PENICULUS  No by my Faith I will not go on unless you tell me the Matter Oh well thought on you have quarrelled with your Wife pray tell me the Occasion of your Dispute  MENAECHMUS  Where shall we find a Sepulchre where unknown to my Wife we may bury the Day in supping voluptuously  PENICULUS  Let us go then nothing can be better spoken we will light the Funeral Pile wherever you please there is no Time to be lost for the Day is already half dead  MENAECHMUS  But while thou triflest away the Time in speaking to me thy own Happiness is delayed ought not the Pile to be already on Fire  PENICULUS  Menaechmus  thrust out this Eye tho' it is the only one I have I am so prest with Hunger that I will not open my Mouth to speak a single Word unless you command me  MENAECHMUS  Come farther from my Door  PENICULUS  I obey  MENAECHMUS  Come yet nearer to me  PENICULUS  Most willingly  MENAECHMUS  How hard it is to make thee leave that Side Retire I say to thee from the Den of that Lion  PENICULUS  By the Temple of  Pollux  I think you would make an excellent Jockey a dextrous Leader of Horses  MENAECHMUS  Why pray  PENICULUS  You look back every Moment to see if your Wife does not follow you  MENAECHMUS  What is that thou say'st  PENICULUS  Me Sir I say whatever you please to all your Affirmatives I say Yes to all your Negatives I say No I have the Honour to be your Eccho both pro and con  MENAECHMUS  When thou smellest any Thing art thou able to guess what Sort of Odour it is that affects thy Sense hast thou a delicate Nose  PENICULUS  Ah in such a Case I my single Self can di  ire better than the whole College of Augurs together  MENAECHMUS  Well then apply thy Nostrils to this Robe which I carry under my Cloak Smell it as thou shouldst well what Scent has it why do'st thou pause  PENICULUS  One must smell the top of a Woman's Habit for it is from that Place the Nose is affected with a Scent one can never get rid of afterwards  MENAECHMUS  Pleasant  Peniculus  smell it here then why dost thou turn aside  PENICULUS  Not without Reason faith  MENAECHMUS  What Reason what does it smell ofAnswer me  PENICULUS  It smells of three Things at once Theft a Whore and a sumptuous Repast  MENAECHMUS  I am going from hence to carry it to  Erotia  my Mistress and will order her at the same Time to get a Supper prepared for herself for thee and me and when we are seated at Table we will protract the Debauch even till the rising of the Morning Sta  PENICULUS  You speak like an Oracle shall I knock at the Door  MENAECHMUS  Knockbut staystay a little  PENICULUS  S'death Sir how long will you delay the sublime Pleasure of eating and drinking  MENAECHMUS  Knock thenbut knock softly  PENICULUS  Sure you think that this Door is made of Glass  MENAECHMUS  Holdhold I conjure you by  Hercules  see my Charmer herself comes out of her House to meet us  PENICULUS  Look one Moment at the Sun I beseech you see how the Lustre of that glorious Luminary is obscured in the Presence of this divine Person  SCENE III  EROTIA PENICULUS and MENAECHMUS  EROTIA  Goodmorrow  Menaechmus  my dearest and most valued Lover  PENICULUS  And pray what am I  EROTIA  You are not one of my Troop  PENICULUS  Treat me at least as a Soldier in the Corps de Reserve who is in Time to fill up the Place of another  MENAECHMUS  Give Orders to have every Thing made ready for the Battle I design to have to Day at your House  EROTIA  I shall not fail  MENAECHMUS  He and I will drink valiantly in this Battle thou shalt judge which of us two Soldiers shews most Courage in emptying the Glasses for it belongs to thee as our General to conduct the Army consider also with what Champion thou wilt enter the Lists this Night Ah my Love how I hate my Wife when I look upon thee she becomes insupportable to me  EROTIA  Nevertheless you cannot refrain from having something of hers about you nay you even wear her Cloaths What Ornament is this tray that you wear on your Body  MENAECHMUS  It formerly belonged to my Wife but now 'tis thine my fair one  EROTIA  If you go on at this Rate my Love you will certainly march at the Head of my amorous Troop and be preferred to all those to whom I sell my pleasurable Nights  PENICULUS  A Curtezan when she sees the Prey ready to fall into her Hands will not give herself Time to flatter and caress but if you loved  Menaechmus  Madam you would already have snatched away half of his Nose with the Eagerness of your Kisses  MENAECHMUS  Hold my Cloak  Peniculus  while I perform the Vow I have made and consecrate these Spoils to my Goddess  PENICULUS  Give it me but before you pull off the Robe let us see you dance in it as I do dance I conjure you in the Name of the great  Hercules  MENAECHMUS  Me dost thou bid dance By the said great  Hercules  I believe thou art mad  PENICULUS  If I am mad certainly you are not much  wiser however pull off the Robe then since you will not dance  MENAECHMUS  I have stolen this Robe to Day but not without exposing myself to great Danger  Hercules  in my Opinion undertook a less hazardous Enterprize when he forced the Girdle from  Hippolita  the Queen of the  Amazons  then I did in robbing my Wife of this Habit receive it from my Hands my dear  Erotia  'tis yours and you deserve it since you are the only Woman in the World that has that Sweetness and Complacency which I expect in the Person I love 'tis thus that those whose Hearts are truly subjected ought to make known their Tenderness for the beloved Object  PENICULUS  Yes those who desire to ruin themselves and ride Post to the Hospital and Beggary  MENAECHMUS  'Tis a Year since I bought this Robe for my Wife it cost me four Minae  PENICULUS  And so there are four Minae thrown away  MENAECHMUS  Dost thou know my Charmer what I expect from three  EROTIA  Tell me and your Will shall be exactly performed  MENAECHMUS  Give Orders then for a great Repast to be prepared at thy House there will be only us three do not delay to send to the Market for whatever can be found there the most delicate but above all don't forget to have some Pigs Cheeks a Ham a Lamb's Head and Hogs Puddings and such other delicious Meats as may when well seasoned excite a voracious Appetite But the Business must be done immediately  EROTIA  By  Fenus  there shall be nothing wanting depend upon it you shall have all you desire  MENAECHMUS  We will go to the public Square we will not stay long and at our Return we will seek in the Bottle for Patience till Dinner is ready  EROTIA  Return when you please my Love you shall find every Thing ready  MENAECHMUS  Let it be done then with all possible DiligenceWill you come  Peniculus  PENICULUS  That I will by  Hercules  I will follow you I will accompany you I will watch you carefully I would not leave you a Moment for the  World What a Fool shou'd I be if I did when the Fortune of a God awaits me  EROTIA  Who is there some of you bid  Cylindrus  my Cook come hitherThere is not a Moment to lose do you hear there  SCENE IV  EROTIA CYLINDRUS  EROTIA  Take a Basket and some Money thou hast three Crowns hast thou not  CYLINDRUS  Yes Madam I have  EROTIA  Go then to Market and buy provision to make an excellent Repast but without Prodigality I tell you before hand there are but three  CYLINDRUS  With Submission Madam who are these three  EROTIA  Menaechmus  his Parasite and me  CYLINDRUS  You increase the Number by seven for the Parasite himself will eat a  much as eight Persons so I reckon there will be ten at Table  EROTIA  I have named the Guests do you take Care of the rest  CYLINDRUS  Look upon all as already done you may sit down to Table when you will  EROTIA  Don't trifle away the Time  CYLINDRUS  I will return in a Moment  End of the First Act  ACT II  SCENE I  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES MESSENION his Slave  MENAECHMUS  IN my Opinion my dear  Messenion  these Seafearing Men know no greater Pleasure in the World than when after a long Voyage they first discover Land  MESSENION  With Submission Sir I think the Pleasure is still more sensibly felt by those who after a tedious Absence from their own Country behold again the well known Port and are ready to touch the Shore But tell me I beseech you Sir what are we come to do here at  Epidamnum  are you resolved to imitate the Sea and go round all the Islands  MENAECHMUS  We are come hither in Search of a Brother a Twin Brother whom I look upon as one half of myself  MESSENION  But what do you imagine will be the Issue of this Search 'tis now six Years since we have wandered on the Sea in a vain Expectation of finding him we have sailed round all  Istria Spain  the Country of the  Massilia  and  Illyria  we have overrun all the  Adriatic  Sea  barbarous Greece  and all the Coasts of  Italy  that are washed by the Ocean Had we been seeking for a Needle in a Bundle of Hay we should have found it by this Time provided it was not invisible In vain do we hope to find a dead Man amongst the Living for if he were still in Being shou'd we not have met with some one e'er now who cou'd have given some Intelligence of him  MENAECHMUS  I am determin'd never to give over my Search till I have found my Brother or met with some Person who having known him can certainly inform me that he is dead This pining Anxiety will then be at an End and I will return to  Syracuse  but till I have that Satisfaction while Life animates this Body I will not cease to wander about the World and seek him every where too sensibly do I feel the Force of fraternal Affection to quit easily the Hope of seeing my Brother again  MESSENION  Truly Sir you desire what can never possibly happen in good Faith we wou'd do much better to return home unless you design to write a History of the whole Earth  MENAECHMUS  No more of these satyrical Speeches good Sir but beware of drawing my Anger upon thee and do not imagine thou can'st oblige me by thy Importunities to follow thy impertinent Councils  MESSENION  How well Sir do you remind me that I am a Slave you have said a great deal in very few Words nothing cou'd be more clearly exprest nevertheless it cannot prevent me from telling you my Thoughts  Vouchsafe Sir to favour me with a Moment's Attention When I examine our Purse when I count the Pieces that are in it by my Faith Sir I find we have not sufficient to maintain us much longer 'tis light very light by  Hercules  Therefore if you do not make Haste home 'tis probable you may soon see it empty and instead of finding your Brother you will yourself fall into the Jaws of Necessity and Misery For you must know Sir the People of  Epidamnum  practise but little the Virtue of Hospitality they are a voluptuous Pe  ple and immoderately addicted to Drinking This City is full of Slanderers and Flatterers Men without Justice and Probity there are here also a great Number of Courtezans who as 'tis said are the most alluring and most dangerous of all that ever practised the Trade In a Word this City is called  Epidamnum  for this Reason that every Stranger who enters it is damned  MENAECHMUS  'Tis fit then that I shou'd be cautious and look about me Give me my Purse  MESSENION  What will you do with it  MENAECHMUS  What you have just now said fills me with Fear  MESSENION  And what is it you fear pray  MENAECHMUS  That you may play me some damned Trick in  Epidamnum  for I know thou art a great Debauchee  Messenion  and art cursedly fond of Women Now I am easily excited to Anger and in those Moments I am no longer Master of myself Therefore by keeping my Money in my own Possession I shall guard against two Inconveniencies Thou wilt not have it in thy Power to be guilty of any Extravagances and consequently I shall not have any Cause to be angry with thee  MESSENION  Very well Sir there is your Purse keep it yourself that I may be as chaste as a Vestal and you as peaceable as a Lamb  SCENE II  CYLINDRUS MENAECHMUS SOSICLES MESSENION  CYLINDRUS  I have bought Provision sufficient to make an excellent Repast for my three Guests a Repast worthy of my superior Skill in Cookery but what do I see  Menaechmus  at our Door already woe to my poor Shoulders the Eaters are ready to set down to Table before I am returned from Market with the Victuals that I am to dress for them I must speak to him Goodmorrow Mr  Menaechmus  MENAECHMUS  Now the Gods bless thee Fellow dost thou know me  CYLINDRUS  Know you Sir a pleasant Question by  Hercules  where are your Companions  MENAECHMUS  My Companions whom dost thou mean Friend  CYLINDRUS  Your Parasite for Example  MENAECHMUS  My Parasite the Fellow is certainly mad  MESSENION  Did I not tell you Sir this City was full of Sharpers  MENAECHMUS  Pray young Man who is this Parasite thou takest of  CYLINDRUS  Peniculus  MESSENION  Cylindrus  is surprized at not seeing the Parasite  Peniculus  with  Menaechmus  whom he takes for the  Menaechmus  of  Epidamnum  and asks where he is  Messenion  eplies he has it safe in his Portmantua The Equivocati  n is pleasant enough  Cylindrus  speaks of a Man  Messenion  affects to believe he means a Brush for that In  trument was in  Latin  call'd  Peniculus  from  Penè  or  Cauda  Tail it being generally made of one  Oh I have it here safe in my Portmantua  CYLINDRUS  You come in good Time Sir for Dinner I am just returned from the Market where I have bought what will make a delicious Repast  MENAECHMUS  Answer me young Man at what Price do they sell here the white Hogs that are destined for Sacrifices  CYLINDRUS  They are a Crown a Piece  MENAECHMUS  See here is a Crown which I will give thee on Condition that thou wilt purchase with it one of those Hogs and let it be offered for thy Cure for whoever thou art 'tis certain thou art mad to importune in this Manner a Man with whom thou art not acquainted  CYLINDRUS  I am  Cylindrus  don't you know my Name  MENAECHMUS  What is thy Name to me go about thy Business I solemnly declare I know thee not and what is more I do not desire to know thee  CYLINDRUS  However Sir I have the Honour to know you your Name is  Menaechmus  I think  MENAECHMUS  Ay now thou speakest like a Man in th  Senses that is indeed my Name but wher  is it thou hast seen me before  CYLINDRUS  Ah mighty well where have I seen yo  you who are a Lover of  Erotia  my fair M  tress  MENAECHMUS  By  Hercules  I am not in Love with a Woman nor do I know who thou art  CYLINDRUS  Strange how can you say so is it not I who so often fill your Glass when you are merry at our House  MESSENION  Oh that I had a good Cudgel in my Hand that I might break the Head of this Fellow  MENAECHMUS  And so you often fill my Glass you say I who am but this Moment arrived at  Epidamnum  and was never here before in my Life  CYLINDRUS  Is it possible you can with a good Conscience deny what I say  MENAECHMUS  Deny it yes by  Hercules  do I  CYLINDRUS  And perhaps you will deny also that that House yonder is not yours and that you do not actually dwell in it  MENAECHMUS  May the Gods confound all the Males and Females that dwell in it I say  CYLINDRUS  Certainly this Gentleman's Brain is cracked or he would not curse himself in this terrible Manner hark Sir  MENAECHMUS  What woud'st thou  CYLINDRUS  Take my Word for it Sir your Brain is a little disordered you would do well with that Crown you promised me some Time ago to buy a Hog for an expiatory Sacrifice for yourself for by  Hercules  Mr  Menaechmus  you are certainly under the Influence of an evil Spirit to curse thus and sport with the Anger of the Gods  MENAECHMUS  Detestable Rascal how he plagues me  CYLINDRUS  Ha faith he is in one of his pleasant Humours he often jests and diverts himself with me for provided his Wife be not with him he is always in good Spirits and rallies incomparably  MENAECHMUS  What is that thou say'st  CYLINDRUS  Faith I know not what to say you puzzle me so confoundedly here look into this Basket if you please Sir do you think I have bought Provision sufficient for you three will what  have here make a Repast good enough for you your Parasite and your Mistress  MENAECHMUS  What Parasite what Mistress do you talk of Fellow  MESSENION  What Fury excites thee to torment this Gentleman as thou dost  CYLINDRUS  Pray what Business have you with me I know not who you are suffer me to speak without being interrupted by you to this Gentleman whom I know very well and to whom I have the Honour to be known  MENAECHMUS  By the Temple of  Pollux  Fellow thou art mad I know not if thou wert always so but at present thou art absolutely mad that's certain  CYLINDRUS  Good Sir jest no longer I beseech you I am going to dress all these good Things and put them by an excellent Seasoning into a fit State to be devoured I assure you Sir all shall be ready in a little Time therefore do not go far from the Door but walk here near  he Fumes of the Kitchen Have you any Commands to your Venus  MENAECHMUS  I command thee to go hang thyself  CYLINDRUS  But by  Hercules  I think you would do better to come in and seat yourself at Table and drink a few Bumpers while I prepare your Dinner pray do SirNay if you won't I can't help itI'll go in myself and inform Madam  Erotia  that you are here perhaps she will prevail upon you to come into the House and divert yourself you will pass your Time much better there than here  MENAECHMUS  I am at last delivered from this Madman by  Pollux  this Beginning seems to be no bad Proof of what you told me of these Impostors of  Epidamnum  MESSENION  Be upon your Guard then Sir 'tis absolutely necessary for by what I can understand from this Fool the Mistress he talks of is certainly a Courtezan  MENAECHMUS  But how should he know my Name I am really surprized at it  MESSENION  By  Hercules  there is nothing surprizing in it you are not acquainted with the Arts of these Courtezans when any foreign Vessels arrive they send their Slaves to the Port to observe the Passengers that come ashore when they see a young Man who seems fit for their  Purpose they enquire his Name his Family and Country they accost him flatter and sooth him and draw him so dextrously into their Snares that he is lost in Love before he enters the City Ah Sir we are certainly attacked by a pirate Vessel of which we have good Reason to be afraid  MENAECHMUS  By  Jupiter  thy Advice seems to be just and reasonable  MESSENION  I shall be convinced that you think so if I see you take all those necessary and prudent Measures which may prevent your dashing yourself against this dangerous Rock  MENAECHMUS  Favour me with a Moment's Silence I beseech you the Door opens let us see who comes out  MESSENION  With your Leave then I will discharge myself of this heavy Burden here you Rowers who are the Feet of your Vessels take it to your Care  SCENE III  EROTIA CYLINDRUS MENAECHMUS SOCICLES MESSENION  ERIOTA  Speaking to her Servants within  Leave the Door open go I do not want  your Attendance take Care to make every Thing ready within Doors you  Cylindrus  perform your Part well and you Girls prepare the Couches for the Table burn the Perfumes that my Lovers may be dissolved in Luxury and Ease and nothing may be wanting to compleat the Voluptuousness of the Feast Magnificence and Pleasures ruin our Gallants but enrich us But where is this teizing Man who my Cook tells me is walking before my Door Oh I see him the most generous the most agreeable of all my Lovers how much am I obliged to him for the Presents he is continually bestowing on me I will treat him as I ought with all the Distinction due to his Merit and give him the Preference to all my other Lovers 'tis fit I accost and speak to him first My Love what dost thou here why dost not come into my House thou who art more welcome to it than to thine own nay 'tis more thine than mine for thou art Master both of it and me every Thing is ready according to thy Order all is prepared every Wish shall be gratified Dinner is served there is nothing to hinder thee from placing thyself at Table  MENAECHMUS  To whom does this Woman think she is speaking  EROTIA  Certainly to you my Dear  MENAECHMUS  Have we ever had the least Occasion to speak to each other before pray where did our Acquaintance first commence  EROTIA  Venus  my tutelary Deity desirous of making me happy brought thee first in my Way thee whom I love more than the whole Race of Mankind besides and by the Temple of  Castor  in preferring thee to all other Men I do thee but Justice for 'tis to thy Liberalities alone that I am indebted for all the Pleasures I enjoy  MENAECHMUS  Certainly  Messenion  this Woman is either mad or her Senses much disordered by Wine that without knowing me or having ever seen me before she speaks to me as to the best Friend she has in the World  MESSENION  Did I not foretel all this wou'd happen Sir ah I knew it well there is nothing more common here 'tis the Leaves only at present which are falling on you but if we stay here three Days longer mark my Prediction you will be crush'd by the Trees themselves The Courtezans in this City have a wonderful Address a charming Dexterity in emptying Purses but with your Leave I'll venture to attack her myself Goodmorrow Madam will you permit me to speak a few Words to you  EROTIA  Very willingly what have you to say to me  MESSENION  I desire much to know where you have been acquainted with this Gentleman  EROTIA  Here at  Epidamnum  we have been long acquainted  MESSENION  At  Epidamnum  you say you have been long acquainted with him but how in the Name of the Furies can this be since he but this Day arrived at  Epidamnum  and was never here before  EROTIA  Pooh this is only to divert yourself we will pursue this Jest within Come my dear  Menaechmus  let us go into the House we shall be more at our Ease there  MENAECHMUS  By the Temple of  Pollux  this Woman knows my Name I am astonish'd how cou'd this happen  MESSENION  The Trull has a good Nose she has smelt your Purse already you shou'd have left it to my Care  MENAECHMUS  Faith thou art in the right I have been guilty of great Folly in taking the Charge of the Money upon myself here take it again and now I shall see whether the Purse or my Person is the Object of her Love  EROTIA  Come my Love let us go in the Repast it ready  MENAECHMUS  Certainly no Invitation was ever more agreeable however Madam be pleased to accept my Thanks for your kind Offer and dispence with me from accepting of it  EROTIA  Since it is so why did you order a great Repast to be prepared  MENAECHMUS  I have I order'd it  EROTIA  Yes you nothing is more certain than that you ordered a delicate Repast for yourself and your Parasite  MENAECHMUS  What Parasite s'death how the Woman raves  EROTIA  Your Parasite  Peniculus  MENAECHMUS  Who is this  Peniculus  this Spunge this Brush to clean Shoes  EROTIA  I protest you counterfeit Ignorance perfectly well this  Peniculus  then is one who affords you a great deal of Amusement this  Peniculus  is in Body and Soul the same identical Person that was with you when you brought me the Robe that you had secretly stolen from your Wife  MENAECHMUS  Very convincing by  Jupiter  what will she not invent at last so I have robb'd my Wife of a Robe and presented it to you seriously Madam your Head is a little touch'd or like a Gelding you sleep standing  EROTIA  What Pleasure can you find in making me your Jest will you pretend to deny what pass'd before as many Witnesses as are present at this Instant  MENAECHMUS  Explain yourself more clearly what is it that I deny  EROTIA  That you have given me to Day a Robe of your Wife's  MENAECHMUS  And that I deny again and will always deny it I never had a Wife and Thanks to the Gods I have none at present I never in my whole Life entered any House in  Epidamnum  I never was in the City I have dined in my Ship and was but just come on Shore when I met you here  EROTIA  Oh  Venus  how wretched am I what Ship do you speak of  MENAECHMUS  A Ship made of Wood which for a long Time has been under Sail Sails casts Anchor is refitted and has received many Blows with a Hammer 'tis exactly like the Working Place of a Skinner one Stake stands near another  EROTIA  Cease to torment me with this idle Raillery come in I conjure thee I begin to grow impatient no more of this Jest but give me your Hand and come in with me  MENAECHMUS  Believe me Madam I'm not the Person whom you seek you take me for another  EROTIA  Do I not know you well are you not  Menaechmus  the Son of  Moschus  is it not  said that you was born at  Syracuse  in  Sicily  where  Agathocles  reign'd after him  Pinthia  then  Linaro  who at his Death left the Kingdom to  Hieron  who is now upon the Throne  MENAECHMUS  All this Madam is very true  MESSENION  Oh  Jupiter  this Woman certainly came from your Country she knows you so perfectly  MENAECHMUS  By  Hercules  I cannot contradict or refuse her any longer  MESSENION  Ah Sir what do I hear take Care how you give Way to this Inclination if you once enter her House you are a lost Man  MENAECHMUS  I will not let so favourable an Occasion escape me be silent then I command thee I am resolved to acquies  e in all she says there is no great Matter in lying a little when it will procure me a good Inn where the Entertainment shall cost me nothing Madam I have opposed every Thing you said a long Time but it was through Fear that my Servant wou'd discover the Affair of the Robe and Repast to my Wife now if you please I will go in with you  EROTIA  I am satisfied and pardon you for your Malice in tormenting me thus long But tell me do you wait here for your Parasite  MENAECHMUS  I do not wait for him I have no Inclination to see him and if he comes I shou'd be glad you wou'd not permit him to enter  EROTIA  By  Venus  I'll obey you willingly but I have one Favour to intreat of you  MENAECHMUS  Speak my Queen command me freely what is it you wou'd have me do  EROTIA  I wou'd have this fine Robe you have given me carried to the Workman to be made fit for my Shape and to have some little Ornaments of my own Taste and Invention added to it  MENAECHMUS  By  Hercules  the Design is excellent go my Dear I see you don't want Prudence the Robe will by this means appear entirely new and if even my Wife shou'd see it she will not be able to know it again  EROTIA  Oblige me then by taking it to the Workman  yourself when you go from hence you promise me to do so don't you my Love  MENAECHMUS  Look upon it as already done I give thee my Word of Love to perform it  EROTIA  Let us go in then  MENAECHMUS  Do then step in my Fair I'll follow thee immediately I must speak one Word to my Servant  Messenion  come hither  MESSENION  Your Pleasure Sir  MENAECHMUS  Softly I have a Desire to know  MESSENION  What  MENAECHMUS  I must  MESSENION  What must you  MENAECHMUS  The Business is begun  MESSENION  What Business  MENAECHMUS  Well well I know thou woud'st be giving me Advice  MESSENION  And I know you value it but little  MENAECHMUS  The Beast is taken I tell thee I hold my Prey in my Hand how dexterously have I managed her I am going to give a Loose to Mirth in the mean Time thou and thy Companions go to some Inn and before Night return and fetch me  MESSENION  Ah Sir you know not these Courtezans believe me you wou'd do much better to follow my Council  MENAECHMUS  Be silent I say to thee if I am guilty of any Folly 'tis my Self that will suffer this is no Business of thine by what I have observed this Woman is very silly and easily imposed upon 'tis she and not I that will be the Dupe  MESSENION  Ah I die he is lost  MENAECHMUS  Why dost thou not go  MESSENION  I fly Sir Ah my Master is plunging himself into an Abyss from whence he will never come out 'tis so the Pirate's Vessel carries off our Barque at last but I am a Fool to pretend to govern my MasterHave I forgot my Duty he bought me for his Slave not for his Governor let me remember that follow me Boys I must come back in good Time to fetch my Master  End of the Second Act  ACT III  SCENE I  PENICULUS  DURING these thirty Years which I have lived I have never been guilty of so wicked so unhappy an Action as this Day my cruel Destiny led me into an Assembly where while I lost my Time in gaping and staring about me  Menaechmus  escaped me Ah without Doubt he is gone to the House of his Mistress and was not willing that I shou'd accompany him and be a Witness of his Pleasures May the Gods pour down their fiercest Wrath upon him who first introduced Assemblies and thereby hindered People who have important Affairs upon their Hands from pursuing their Business Assemblies ought only to be composed of indolent and idle Persons such ought to be summoned to appear and when they don't obey be punished by large Fines A great many of the Inhabitants of this City eat always alone and in private Citizens wholly useless to their Country who  have never performed the least Service to the Commonwealth mean sordid Wretches that invite no Person to their Table and are never invited to others Such as these ought regularly to assist at Assemblies and public Meetings  If this excellent Order this useful Custom had been observed I shou'd not to Day have had the Misfortune of losing so plentiful and delicious a Repast for I am as well assured that  Menaechmus  had once a Design to treat me this Day as I am among the Number of the Living However I will go to him as late as it is I have always Hopes of finding some Remains of the Feast this Thought alone consoles me and raises my depress'd Spirits but is not that  Menaechmus  himself that I see he is coming out with a Crown of Flowers on his Head ah miserable that I am the Feast is finish'd they are risen from Table by all the Furies I am come too late  SCENE II  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES PENICULUS  MENAECHMUS  If I bring you back to Day your Robe fitted to your Shape and adorned as you desire will you be contented my Charmer I will have it done in such a Manner that you yourself shall not be able to know it again  PENICULUS  So so he is going to carry the Robe to the Workman after having filled himself well with Meat and Wine without giving the poor Parasite his Share by  Hercules  I will forfeit my illustrious Name I will cease to be myself rather than not demand the Cause of this Affront and gratify my Vengeance on the Author of it here will I watch the Motions of my new Enemy and when I have penetrated into his Designs I will accost him and have a Conference with him  MENAECHMUS  Ye Gods who cannot die although sometimes ye desire Death Immortal Gods is there a Man in the World on whom in one Day you have conferred so many Benefits and who expected them so little I have eaten of most delicious Fare I have drank plentifully and what is still better I have possessed a charming  Courtezan  and to compleat my good Fortune I carry away with me a rich Robe which  Erotia  wou'd have done well to have given me to remember her by for by the Faith of an honest Man she shall never see it again  PENICULUS  How securely the Gentleman disburthens his Heart of its Gaiety and now that his Belly is full without doubt he diverts himself at my Expence and laughs in his Sleeve at  the Fast I have kept while he was indulging himself over his good Cheer  MENAECHMUS  She pretends that I have given her this fine Robe and that I stole it from my Wife I wou'd not undeceive her but began to flatter and caress her as if I had been the most passionate of her Lovers I agreed to all she said answered Yes or No as she pleased in short I was never more splendidly more voluptuously entertained in my Life  PENICULUS  Oh I can no longer contain myself I must speak to him  MENAECHMUS  Who is this Man that comes to meet me  PENICULUS  What can you say for yourself light wavering and inconstant Man tell me oh most wicked most villainous most deceitful most contemptible of all Mortals what Crime have I been guilty of towards thee that thou shouldst thus barbarously rob me of Life how cou'd you leave me so basely in the public Square and in my Absence bury a large Repast in your gluttonous Maw how have you dared to commit such daring Injustice for can you deny that a Share of this Feast was not my lawful Inheritance  MENAECHMUS  What is the meaning of this Outrage young Man what Business have you ever had with me and why do you load with such injurious Reproaches a Man entirely unknown to you do you want to oblige me to pay you for the ill Names you have called me with as many good Blows with my Cudgel  PENICULUS  You have done me more Misehief already than if you had beaten me  MENAECHMUS  By your Leave young Man what is your Name I have a great Curiosity to know it  PENICULUS  What Joke is this to pretend to be ignorant of my Name has our Acquaintance then commenced but this Moment  MENAECHMUS  By the Temple of  Pollux  this is the first Time I ever saw you at least for what I know but certain I am that I have no Acquaintance with you but whoever you are for your own Sake cease your injurious Language and torment me no longer with your mistaken Reproaches  PENICULUS  Dare you thus confidently deny that you know me  MENAECHMUS  If I do know you what Reason can I have to deny it  PENICULUS  Ah  Menaechmus  awake from this Dream and recall your Senses  MENAECHMUS  By  Hercules  I think I am awake and I have all the Senses that I received from Nature  PENICULUS  Is it possible that you don't know your Parasite  MENAECHMUS  You are mad young Man stark mad by  Jupiter  PENICULUS  Answer this Question I beseech you did you not rob your Wife of a Robe to Day to make a Present to your Mistress  Erotia  MENAECHMUS  By  Hercules  I have no Wife nor have I given a stolen Robe to  Erotia  PENICULUS  Amazing you dream waking the Thing is incontestable did I not see you a Moment ago come out of  Erotia  's House with a Robe on your Body  MENAECHMUS  Confound you for an Ideot you judge of others by yourself and because you are a ridiculous Fop you think I am so also so you really say you have seen me in a Female Habit  PENICULUS  Yes I maintain it I have seen you  MENAECHMUS  Go hang yourself Blockhead or rather go and offer an expiatory Sacrifice to the Gods that they may cure you of this Folly for you are certainly the most stupid of all Mortals  PENICULUS  I swear by the Temple of  Pollux  mark me  Menaechmus  that no Consideration whatever shall hinder me from telling your unhappy Wife this whole Affair yes she shall know every Thing that has passed without the least Disguise and thus the Injuries you have done me shall fall heavy upon yourself I will enjoy my Revenge at my Ease and console myself with that for the good Cheer you have had the Barbarity to deprive me of for oh this Disappointment to Day tortures me horribly depend upon it I will be revenged it shall never be said you have devour'd all this excellent Feast for nothing I tell you again it shall cost you dear  MENAECHMUS  Will this Delusion never have an end shall I be eternally mock'd in this Manner every Person I see banters me and accuses me of Things I am entirely ignorant of by  Hercules  this is very provoking but the Door opens what will come next  SCENE III  A Maid Servant MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  Servant  Mr  Menaechmus  my Mistress  Erotia  intreats you will buy an Ounce of Gold to be added to the Robe and that you will also carry this Bracelet to the Goldsmith and desire him to mend it and alter it so that it may appear quite new  MENAECHMUS  Go my Child tell thy Mistress from me that I will carefully perform her Commission and not only this but any other she pleases to command me my Purse and my Person shall be always at her Service  Servant  Do you know this Bracelet  MENAECHMUS  No but I perceive it is Gold  Servant  'Tis the same Bracelet which you said some Time ago you had stolen out of your Wife's Cabinet  MENAECHMUS  By  Hercules  I never said so  Servant  What have you forgot it give me the Bracelet again then since you do not remember it was yours  MENAECHMUS  Stay stay let me consider a littleOh I remember the Jewel perfectly well yes it is the same Bracelet I gave to my Mistress the very same  Servant  You are sure of it then  MENAECHMUS  Very sure but where are the two other Jewels that I gave her at the same Time  Servant  You gave her no more than this Bracelet  MENAECHMUS  By  Pollux  when I gave her this I gave her the others  Servant  Well▪  ke Care of this  MENAECHMUS  You may assure her that I will not neglect any Thing she commands I will give the Workman Orders to send home the Robe and the Bracelet at the same Time  Servant  Ah sweet Sir do me the Favour to give me a Pair of Gold Earings about the Weight of two Crowns come Mr  Menaechmus  comply generously with this Request and be assured I will always meet you with Smiles when you come to our House  MENAECHMUS  Oh I will do this with Pleasure only give me the Gold and I'll take Care to have the Earings made and will pay for the Fashion  Servant  Be so good Sir to lend me the Gold I'll certainly pay you some Time or other  MENAECHMUS  No no I insist upon your furnishing the Gold yourself look into your Hoards and bring me the two Pieces  Servant  I'll enter into an Engagement to pay it back double  MENAECHMUS  I have no Gold at present  Servant  Well you'll oblige me when you have have you any Commands to my Mistress  MENAECHMUS  Tell her the Robe and the Bracelet shall be sent very soon and alter'd to her Fancy So she is gone the Door is shut Oh fortunate  Menaechmus  certainly thou art highly favoured by the Gods what a Profusion of Benefits have they showered upon thee but what a Fool am I to linger here why do I not seize this favourable Opportunity to make my Escape Go then  Menaechmus  Courage Man haste away and make good Use of thy Feet I'll throw my Crown of Flowers on the left Hand so if they shou'd take it into their Heads to pursue me they will suppose I went that Way Now will I go seek my Slave  Messenion  for I am impatient to tell him what good Fortune the Gods have sent me  End of the Third Act  ACT IV  SCENE I  The Wife of MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  PENICULUS the Parasite  Wife  HOW can I think of living with a Husband who robs me of my Cloaths to present to his Mistress  PENICULUS  In the Name of  Jupiter  Madam make no Noise you will spoil all if you will be directed by me you shall surprize this unfaithful Husband in the very fact Come this Way I beseech you your Husband hath drank plentifully and intoxicated as he is he wou'd not neglect carrying the Robe he robb'd you of to Day to the Workman he had a festal Crown upon his Head Ha what do I see here the very same Crown by  Hercules  now I hope you do not doubt me he has certainly  taken this Way shall we follow him or watch his Return where we are by  Pollux  here he comes but I tell you beforehand he has not your Robe with him  Wife  What shall I do with this Man  PENICULUS  What shall you do have you not the same Weapon in your Possession that you always had the same Instrument of Vengeance In short have you not the same Tongue make Use of it now then and be reveng'd  Wife  Your Advice is very good I shall follow it and truly I don't need many Persuasions to it  PENICULUS  Let us retire this Way a little we will rush out upon him at once and surprize him  SCENE II  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  his Wife and PENICULUS  MENAECHMUS  We have a Custom here that is no less foolish than troublesome and yet the wisest and best of us continue to observe it exactly we are extremely desirous of having a great Number of Dependants and of being perpetually solicited  by Clients but never give ourselves the Trouble to enquire whether they are good or bad we never concern ourselves about their Probity their Integrity or the Merit of their Cause all we desire to know is if they are rich If the Client is poor though his Behaviour be ever so unexceptionable yet he passes for a Man who has very bad Principles if he be rich however wicked and base his Life and Manners yet we extol him for a Man of great Virtue there are some who regard neither Law or Equity who are continually persecuting their Patrons who deny to have received what has been given them and who having acquired large Fortunes by Usury and swearing falsely delight in continually involving themselves and others in Lawsuits when they have determined on a Day to have their Causes pleaded they acquaint their Advocates or Patrons with it and whatever Crimes they have committed they must defend them whether the Cause be pleaded before the People before the Pretor or before the Judge  A Client of this Sort has been the Cause of all my Mortification to Day he disappointed me in all my Designs and robb'd me of those Hours I had resolved to dedicate to Pleasure I have pleaded for him before the Ediles and after a great deal of wicked Disputation I offered the adverse Party Conditions equally cruel and unjust and mindful of my Disappointment went no farther in my Pleading than what was just necessary to form an Engagement  upon  The Pleaders on both Sides were obliged to lay down a certain Sum of Money which each Party looked upon as the Reward of Victory this Money was called a Fine because it was the design'd Punishment of a Lawsuit unjustly undertaken  Well what did my Client Why he gave Security I protest I never saw a Man so clearly so manifestly convicted the Crimes he was accused of were proved upon him by three Witnesses May all the Gods punish him for the voluptuous Hours he has made me lose this Day and may Heaven chastise me also for my Folly in going to the Assembly and depriving myself of a delicious Day  I ordered a good Repast to be prepared and I know my Mistress waits for me with great Impatience I could not help this Delay I left the Assembly as soon as possible I do not doubt but  Erotia  will be extremely offended but she will be appeased by reflecting on the fine Robe I stole from my Wife to present to her  PENICULUS  Do you hear is it I that have made him confess this Villainy what do you say to this  Wife  I say that I am very unhappy in a Husband  PENICULUS  But did you understand what he said  Wife  Too well Oh Gods too well  MENAECHMUS  If I act wisely I shall certainly go in here where I shall be more at my Ease than at Home and swim in Luxury and Pleasure  Wife  Stay Wretch for this Time I will disappoint you Detection and Shame have overtaken you thou shalt pay back with Interest the Robe you have robb'd me of this is the Consequence of such Liberalities were you such a Fool as to imagine such Crimes cou'd be long concealed or committed with Impunity  MENAECHMUS  What do you mean Wife what is the Matter  Wife  Excessive Assurance dare you ask me what is the Matter  MENAECHMUS  Wou'd you have me ask this Man then  PENICULUS  No Coaxingit will signify nothing go on Madam maintain your Rights as you ought  MENAECHMUS  What Cause have I given you  Peniculus  to treat me so ill  Wife  You ought to know  PENICULUS  He is not ignorant of the Reason I have to c  mplain of him but the wicked Wretch pretends to know nothing about it  MENAECHMUS  But come explain this Business to me  Wife  The Robe  MENAECHMUS  What Robe  Wife  Who was it that carried away my Robe  PENICULUS  What are you afraid Sir  MENAECHMUS  Yes faith of one Thing I confess this Robe makes me tremble  PENICULUS  'Tis your Turn now I trembled Heaven knows while you eat in my Absence that exquisite  Repast to which you had invited me go on Madam do not spare this perfidious Husband let him feel the Violence of your Resentment  MENAECHMUS  Wilt thou not be silent ungrateful as thou art  PENICULUS  No by  Hercules  I will not be silent he makes Signs to me to say nothing  MENAECHMUS  By  Hercules  thou lvest I made no Sign either with my Head or Eyes  Wife  How unhappy how miserable am I  MENAECHMUS  In what are you unhappy tell me Madam  PENICULUS  This Man has not his Equal for Impudence in the whole World with what Confidence he denies a Thing as clear as the Sun  MENAECHMUS  I swear to thee Wife by  Jupiter  and all the immortal Gods I did not make any Sign to this Fellow Are you satisfied  PENICULUS  You need not take much Pains to persuade her to believe that stay stay Sir we have not done with you yet pray come back  MENAECHMUS  Come back for what  PENICULUS  In my Opinion you cannot do better than to go to the Embroiderer and bring back the Robe this is all you have for it now  MENAECHMUS  What Robe is it that you both stun my Ears with thus  Wife  What have I to do but be silent since he pretends to have forgot this disgraceful Action  MENAECHMUS  Have any of my Slaves offended thee Wife I know Servants often answer saucily and 'tis difficult to govern them but you need only complain to me and I will chastise them severely I'll make them observe their Duty  PENICULUS  You are merry Sir  MENAECHMUS  You seem to labour with some violent Uneasiness  Wife Sorrow is painted on your Face tell me the Cause  PENICULUS  You mock her certainly  MENAECHMUS  Has any of the Family offended her  PENICULUS  You are pleasant you turn her into Ridicule  MENAECHMUS  Is it with me then that she is angry  PENICULUS  Aye now you speak seriously  MENAECHMUS  By  Pollux  I never did her the least Injury  PENICULUS  Now you begin to rally again  MENAECHMUS  Tell me my dear Wife what is the Cause of your Uneasiness  PENICULUS  He begins to flatter now beware of him  MENAECHMUS  Mischievous Fellow can't you hold your Tongue 'tis your Business to be neuter here  I say nothing to you why then do you torment me  Wife  Let my Hand alone keep your Caresses for your Mistress  PENICULUS  Mind that Sir another Time make haste to devour the Feast in my Absence and afterwards laugh at me insult me and throw your Crown of Flowers on the Ground when you have eaten and drank plentifully  MENAECHMUS  What dost thou mean I have not eaten to Day I am yet fasting nor have I been with  Erotia  since I parted from her with you  PENICULUS  Dare you deny it  MENAECHMUS  Yes by  Hercules  I dare and will maintain that your Reproaches are as false as Hell  PENICULUS  Most impudent of Men did I not see you a Moment ago come out of  Erotia  's House with a festal Crown upon your Head did you not treat me like a Fool or a Madman swear you knew me not and that you only this Day arrived at  Epidamnum  MENAECHMUS  How is it possible I shou'd have had this strange Conversation with you since I have never seen you since we parted at the Assembly till this Moment  PENICULUS  Ah I know the very bottom of your Heart you did not think I was capable of taking a severe Revenge for the Injury you did me but by  Hercules  you was deceived for I have told all to your Wife  MENAECHMUS  How what is it thou hast told her  PENICULUS  I have forgot take the Trouble to ask her  MENAECHMUS  'Tis well Rascal My dear Wife what is it this Rogue of a Parasite has told you tell me why are you silent speak freely open your Heart to me without Disguise  Wife  As if you knew not the Cause of my Grief my rich Robe is stolen from me  MENAECHMUS  Is it possible your rich Robe stolen say you what News is this you tell me  Wife  Ought you to be surprised at this News  MENAECHMUS  If I knew how it happened I wou'd procure you Satisfaction  PENICULUS  With what Assurance he dissembles and pretends Ignorance of the Fact but it is all to no Purpose your Roguery cannot be concealed for by  Hercules  I who know it have discovered all to your Wife  MENAECHMUS  What have you discovered  Wife  Since you have lost all Shame and are resolved to persist in your Falsehood hear me Wretch I will tell you the Cause of my Uneasiness and what your Parasite has informed me of my Robe is stolen out of my House  MENAECHMUS  But seriously have you been robb'd of a Robe  PENICULUS  Subtle Wretch how he equivocates the Robe is stolen that's certain Madam and stolen for a Whore  MENAECHMUS  What have you to do in this Affair but what is it you tell me Wife  Wife  Must I repeat it eternally I tell you again that my Robe is taken out of the House  MENAECHMUS  Who has taken it  Wife  By  Pollux  he that took it knows the Thief very well  MENAECHMUS  Who is that Man  Wife  One  Menaechmus  MENAECHMUS  By  Jupiter  it was a villainous Action but who is this  Menaechmus  Wife  Yourself  MENAECHMUS  Me me do you say  Wife  Yes you I say  MENAECHMUS  Who is my Accuser  Wife  Myself  PENICULUS  And I also nay more I will prove that you stole away the Robe to carry it to your Mistress  Erotia  MENAECHMUS  I have I given a Robe to any one  PENICULUS  You you no other than you must we bring an Owl hither to scream out You without ceasing in your Ears your Wife and I are fatigued with repeating this Word so often  MENAECHMUS  I swear to you Wife by  Jupiter  and all the Gods sure this will satisfy you that I have not given away your Robe  PENICULUS  And we swear to you by  Hercules  that we do not lye  MENAECHMUS  Then you know that I have not given away the Robe I have only lent it for a little Time upon Condition that when the Person  who borrow'd has made Use of it once it shall be returned immediately  Wife  By the Temple of  Castor  I never lend any of your Coats or Cloaks to any Person whatever it belongs to me only to lend my Cloaths and to you to do what you please with your own  MENAECHMUS  Don't be uneasy your Robe shall be brought back to you I will take that trouble upon myself  Wife  It will be your Interest to do so for depend upon it if you do not bring back my Robe you shall never come into my House again  MENAECHMUS  How will you shut my own Doors upon me will you presume to banish me from my own House  PENICULUS  But pray Madam what Reward will you bestow upon me for informing you of this Roguery  Wife  When such an Accident happens to you I will do you the same Service you have done me  PENICULUS  By the Temple of  Pollux  I am in no Danger of such an Accident happening to me for I have nothing to lose May the Gods confound the Husband and Wife both I say what can I do now I must even go to the public Square and see if

from home Fool as if I had not another Place to go to where I shall pass my Time more agreeably than with a scolding Wife If my Wife is offended I have the Consolation to think that my  Erotia  will receive me with open Arms she will not banish me from her no she will welcome me with TransportI will go to her immediately and intreat her to give me back this cursed Robe which has occasioned so much Noise and I will buy her a better Hollo who is there what neither Porter nor Portress open the Door I say and tell your Mistress I am here  SCENE III  EROTIA MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  EROTIA  Who

quitted you to the Assembly I have not had the Pleasure of seeing your Face till this Moment  EROTIA  Ah I see your Design I have found you out because I was silly enough to give you an Occasion to

Mistress shamefully dismissed by both What shall I do neither of them will trust me again I must consult my Friends upon this Misfortune and follow their Advice  End of the Fourth Act  ACT V  SCENE I  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES the Wife of MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  MENAECHMUS  I Committed a great Folly when I confided my Purse to the Care of  Messenion  the Rascal is certainly wasting his Time and my Money in some BaudyHouse  Wife  I am impatient to know if my Husband will return home again Ha there he is I am happy he brings me back my Robe  MENAECHMUS  I cannot imagine where this Slave of mine is  Wife  I'll meet him and scold him as he deserves  are you not ashamed wicked Man as you are to appear before me with that Robe  MENAECHMUS  Hey what is the meaning of this certainly Madam you have lost your Wits  Wife  How impudent Wretch have you the Boldness to open your Mouth to answer me  MENAECHMUS  What Crime have I been guilty of to be condemned to keep my Mouth shut pray  Wife  Dare you ask that Question insolent shameless most wicked of all Mortals  MENAECHMUS  HumPray Madam have you read History enough to know why the  Greeks  call'd Queen  Hecuba  a Bitch  Wife  Not I  MENAECHMUS  Because Misfortunes having deprived this old Princess of her Senses she talked in the Manner you do now and loaded every Person she saw with Abuse 'Twas with Justice therefore that the  Greeks  gave her the Appellation of Bitch  Wife  'Tis absolutely impossible to bear with your Irregularities any longer I wou'd much rather chuse to live like a Widow the remainder of my Days than with a Husband that abandons himself to such monstrous Excesses  MENAECHMUS  If you have Resolution enough to live without Man and abandon your Spouse what is that to me pray is it the Custom in  Epidamnum  for Women of Distinction to fasten upon Strangers just arrived and acquaint them with the Secrets of their Families  Wife  Yes I repeat it our Union shall be dissolved I wou'd rather pass my Days in the most rigid Chastity than suffer any longer your horrible Disorders  MENAECHMUS  By  Hercules  with all my Heart live a Widow to Eternity you have my free Consent  Wife  But dare you insolent that you are dare you deny that you stole my Robe when at this Moment you wear it on your Body as an Ornament Wretch how cou'd you be guilty of such an Action without blushing  or rather without being ready to expire with Shame  MENAECHMUS  By  Hercules  Madam this is past bearing and all the Respect I owe your Sex cannot hinder me from telling you that you are as bold as wicked to charge me with having robb'd you of this Robe when it was given me by a Woman whom I believe you never saw to get alter'd for her  Wife  Ah this is too muchthey will make me desperate By  Castor  I will send for my Father and give him an exact Account of your fine Behaviour Who's there One of you go to my Father and tell him I beg to see him immediately upon an Affair of Consequence Now Sir your Debaucheries shall be all exposed I will paint you in your proper Colours  MENAECHMUS  Are you crazy Mistress what Debaucheries am I guilty of pray  Wife  When you rob me who am your Wife and a too too faithful one for such a Husband when you rob me I say of my Cloaths and Jewels and give them publickly to your Whore can you wonder that I complain of such Treatment  MENAECHMUS  In the Name of  Hercules  Madam I beseech you tell me if you can is there any Drug any Potion that if I drank wou'd give me Spirits to support your amazing Boldness I wou'd fain know who you take me for for my Part I declare I know you not nor ever saw you before  Wife  Though you divert yourself with turning me into Ridicule yet sure you will have some Consideration some Respect for my Father whom I have sent for Ha here he comes look on him know you this venerable old Man Sir  MENAECHMUS  Just as well as the Prophet  Calchus  I tell you this is the first Time I ever saw him  Wife  Wretch wilt thou deny that thou know'st me or my Father  MENAECHMUS  Yes by  Hercules  and your Grandfather also  Wife  Amazing Impudence  SCENE II  The Old Man Fatherinlaw of MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  the Wife of the same and MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  Old Man  I am going to my Daughter's House as fast as my great Age will permit me but well I know this Walk will be very difficult for every Step is slower than the former I sink under the Weight of Years and drag a heavy Body which my Limbs are hardly able to support my Strength is almost gone I carry my Years on my Back like bad Merchandize for this wicked old Age whenever it comes brings with it a great many Followers a Croud of Inconveniencies and natural Defects in short old Age is subject to so many Miseries that if I undertook to recount them I shou'd die before the Detail was ended But besides the Pain of being old which is not small I am assaulted by a new Affliction that touches me sensibly my Daughter has sent for me in a violent Hurry she intreats that I will come immediately what can be the occasion of this Message what Accident has happened my Imagination represents a thousand different Things to me all equally tormenting  But what I am most surprised at is that my Daughter has sent only a general Message which gives me no Light into the Affair Ah she wou'd have done better to have spared  me this Anxiety by informing me exactly what the Business is Mean Time I conjecture I divine and I am much deceived if I am not right some new Family Storm some domestic Hurricane has occasioned this Message Women who bring large Portions to their Husbands expect to make them wear the Yoke these Women I say are generally very bad and if the poor Husband endeavours but ever so little to maintain his Right of Superiority the House will be always full of Noise the Husbands indeed often abuse their Power and then 'tis they who are in the wrong To render the conjugal State happy 'tis necessary that the Authority of the Husband ought to be exerted with Prudence and the Submission of the Wife be bounded by Reason by  Pollux  it certainly is not for any trivial Matter that my Drughter has sent for me 'tis something of Consequence but whatever it is I shall know presently Ha do I not see this Couple before the Door of their House the Husband has a discontented Air his Uneasiness is painted in his Countenance how well have I guess'd they are quarrelling ah I am seldom deceived I must begin my Interposition by first speaking to the Wife  Wife  My dear Father  Old Man  How do you my Daughter am I welcome what good News have you for me but you look sad what is the Cause why  does your Husband look so angrily on you you have certainly had a Battle between you at least with your Tongues tell me truly Daughter which of you two is most in Fault and merits most the paternal Censure tell me in few Words all I ought to be acquainted with either as Judge or Mediator  Wife  I must first assure you my dear Father that I am guilty of no Fault you may rely absolutely upon this Testimony of my Innocence though given by myself but at the same Time Father I declare to you that it is impossible for me to live any longer here I therefore conjure you to separate me from this Man and take me home to you again  Old Man  What's this I hear have you Reasons sufficient to induce you to make me this Demand  Wife  I am slighted I am despised and am obliged to bear the most cruel the most shocking Indignities  Old Man  Who is it that treats you so unworthily  Wife  That Man there who promised you to love me and make me happpy him who bears  the Name of Husband to me and oh more wretched me whose Wife I too certainly am  Old Man  How often have I warned you my Daughter to exert all your Prudence in avoiding Quarrels that neither your Husband or you might have any Occasion to make me Complaints  Wife  But how can I obey you in this my Father you suppose the Thing possible but I swear to you solemnly it is not  Old Man  Is it to me you address yourself  Wife  Yes if you will have the Goodness to hear me  Old Man  Alas how many Times have I recommended it to you Daughter to conform to the Will of your Husband you ought never to observe where he goes or what he does or endeavour to pry into his Diversions or Intrigues  Wife  But he is in Love with a professed Courtezan who lives in our Neighbourhood  Old Man  Is he so faith I like him the better for it and to reward you for your Diligence in discovering this Intrigue I will do my best to forward it and engage your Spouse in new Gallantries  Wife  But alas Sir his Debaucheries are not confined to Women alone he drinks there to Excess and buries himself in Voluptuousness in this infamous Brothel  Old Man  What is it to you where he drinks how far will you carry your Insolence why do you not forbid him to go abroad or to invite any Person to his Table Do you expect that Husbands will relinquish their Authority and take Pleasure in serving their Wives and becoming Slaves to their unreasonable Wills you might with equal Justice expect your Husband to sit amongst your Maids and spin  Wife  Alas Father you did not come I find to be my Patron my Message has procured a good Advocate for my Husband you are here indeed at my Request but you plead only against me  Old Man  If your Husband is faulty I declare myself against him and I shall condemn him more  severely than I have done you from his Advocate I shall become his Accuser but since I find that he supplies you with every Thing you want and maintains you in Elegance and Splendor in my Opinion a Woman of Sense ought to be contented with these Proofs of Affection and endeavour to merit them by Sweetness and Complacency  Wife  Ah Father I have only told you the slightest of his FaultsWou'd you think it This kind Husband opens my Cabinets takes away my Cloaths my Gold my Jewels to enrich and adorn his Whore  Old Man  Oh if he does so he does very ill but on the other Side if this should be a Falshood a Calumny you are guilty of a most enormous Crime in thus aspersing the Innocence of your Spouse  Wife  I can give you an immediate Proof of the Truth of what I say at this Instant he has a Robe and Bracelet of mine about him he had given them to his Mistress but finding I had discovered his Baseness he brought back his Booty apparently through Shame and Necessity  Old Man  I will know from himself the bottom of this Affair I will accost him and give him Audience  in his Turn as a good and impartial Judge is obliged to do Your Servant Soninlaw I wou'd fain know the Occasion of your Uneasiness you seem to be angry with your Wife what is the Subject of your Dispute pray tell me  MENAECHMUS  Good Man whoever you are I take  Jupiter  and all the Gods to witness  Old Man  Upon what Account why do you thus invoke the Inhabitants of Heaven  MENAECHMUS  I swear by  Jupiter  and all his Court that I have not offered the least Injury whatever to this Woman here She accuses me of no less than robbing her of a Robe and this suppos'd Crime is so strongly impressed on her Imagination that she is ready to swear I am guilty of it But I beseech you Sir take Notice of what I am going to say if ever I was within the House of this Lady I wish I may become the most miserable of all Mortals  Old Man  What do you say  Menaechmus  are you mad can any Thing be more extravagant than such a Wish You swear you have never been within her House and yet 'tis there that you dwell surely this is a very wild and ridiculous Sally  MENAECHMUS  And do you really say Sir that I actually dwell in this House here  Old Man  And do you Sir dare to deny it  MENAECHMUS  Yes by  Hercules  and I will maintain it  Wife  Then you will maintain a Falshood with the highest Degree of Impudence unless you removed last Night and fix'd your Dwelling in some other Place  Old Man  Come hither Daughter Well  Menaechmus  what do you answer to that have you really removed from hence  MENAECHMUS  To go whither and upon what Business  Old Man  By  Pollux  I know not  Wife  Indeed Father this Man laughs at you  Old Man  Daughter be silent Come  Menaechmus  be  serious I beseech you you have jested with us long enough  MENAECHMUS  Prithee Whitehead what is your Business with me from whence come you who are you what have I done to you or what in Conscience and Honour has this Woman to reproach me with that she torments me in this Manner  Wife  How his Colour changes how he trembles observe his Eyes my Father how fierce and wild they look  MENAECHMUS  These wise People will have it that I am mad 'tis well I will confirm them in that Opinion I cannot make use of a better Stratagem to free myself from their tormenting Importunities  Old Man  Come hither Daughter stand further from that Man  Wife  How wild and fierce he looks he seems to be collecting all his Force to rush on us great Gods what shall we do  MENAECHMUS  Evoé Evoé Bromie Oh Son of  Jupiter  from what Part of the Forest dost thou call me to the Chace I hear thy Voice and wou'd obey but cannot get loose from this Place a  furious Woman like an enrag'd Bitch seizes me on the left Side and on the other an old Man that stinks like a Goat a Man that made the innocent perish by bearing false Witness against them  Old Man  Perish thyself thou abominable Lyar  MENAECHMUS  Ha I hear  Apollo  from the Depth of his Sanctuary he commands me to burn out the Eyes of this wicked old Man with two flaming Flambeaux  Wife  Alas my Father we are lost he threatens to burn out our Eyes  MENAECHMUS  Have I not Cause to complain they will have it that I am mad yet certainly they themselves have lost the Use of their Reason if ever they had any which indeed is much to be doubted  Old Man  Daughter a Word with you  Wife  What shall we do Father in this new Disress  Old Man  The best Thing we can do I believe is to get some Slaves to bind this Madman and then carry him into the House where he may  be confined before he commits greater Disorders  MENAECHMUS  Ha will you so faith I believe this will prove a scurvy Jest after all if I don't extricate myself quickly out of their Hands they'll certainly carry me into the House and make me a PrisonerAgain I hear the Voice of  Apollo  he commands me not to spare my Nails but to make a dreadful Havoc in the Face of this old Man unless he goes away immediately to hang himselfYes great Divinity you shall be obeyed nor will I fail to exercise the Vigour of my Arms upon the Face of the Woman also  Old Man  Fly fly my Daughter secure yourself in the House I am afraid this Madman will strike you  Wife  I go but oh my Father take Care that he does not escape Alas unhappy Woman that I am to see my Husband in this miserable Condition  MENAECHMUS  Good I have succeeded in sending the Fury hence I must now also put to Flight this old Wretch this long Beard this  Tithon  this shivering Body this Son of  Cignus  with his white head Great  Apollo  you command me to bruise his Sides to break his Bones to  crush his Members and that with the very same Stick which he carries in his Hand to support his tottering Steps with  Old Man  Stay where you are Madman advance no farther for if you have the Impudence to touch me or only offer to approach me you shall severely repent it  MENAECHMUS  I will faithfully follow your Orders  Apollo  my Master and Inspirer I will take a Saw with two Edges I will grind his Bones I will rip up his Belly and cut his Entrails to Pieces  Old Man  I must be upon my Guard he keeps his Eyes fix'd upon me he has a menacing Air he will certainly rush upon my poor Skeleton and do me a Mischief  MENAECHMUS  How many Orders you give me at one Time divine  Apollo  what shall I do first Ha thou sayst I must take a Set of untamed furious Horses and ascend a Car to hunt this Lyon of  Getulia  this stinking Lyon without Teeth 'tis doneI am already mounted on the Car I press the Seat one Hand grasps the Reins the other holds aloft my Weapon come on then my brave my valiant Horses now show your Swiftness your Vigour and your Courage make known your Fire by the Rapidity  of your Course let your Steps be wing'd with Lightning let the Earth resound with the Thunder of your Hoofs  Old Man  What do you threaten to tear me in Pieces with your Horses and to drive your Car over my Body  MENAECHMUS  Again I feel the inspiring God he bids me spring upon that Man and murder him Ha who is the presumptuous Wretch that dares to hold my Horses and stop my Car whoever he be he opposes the Execution of your Sentence great God he cancels the Decree of  Apollo  Old Man  Alas this is indeed a dreadful Disease immortal Gods deign to have Pity on us how has this horrible Accident happened to him my Soninlaw was once wise and discreet and all of a sudden his Brain is distemper'd this Misfortune requires a speedy Remedy I must make Haste and get a Physician immediately  SCENE III  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  MENAECHMUS  So I am at last delivered from these pleasant People who are determined to believe me  mad and yet I am very certain that I am perfectly well but now that I am safe now that I am delivered from my Persecutors what hinders me from making Haste to my Ship Gentlemen grant me one Favour if you please if the old Man should return I intreat ye all and there is really a good Number of you I intreat ye all I say not to tell him which Way I have taken  SCENE IV  Old Man  I have sat so long that my Back aches with anxiously waiting till the Doctor return'd from visiting his Patients At last having finish'd his sick Rounds the hateful Fellow comes home He must be a Man of eminent Knowledge of an almost supernatural Skill in his Profession he recounts as two of his greatest Exploits the having set the Thigh of  Esculapius  and the Arm of  Apollo  two admirable Cures it must be confessed without the Assistance of this wonderful Operator the God of Medicine himself wou'd have had Occasion for Crutches and the glorious  Apollo  for an Arm of Silver I really know not at present whether this Man ought to be call'd a Physician or a Mechanic for if he has cured two Divinities there cannot be a more glorious Testimony of his Skill or a greater Honour for his Profession but if he has only refitted two broken Statues the Exploit is not very extraordinary Here he comes a most grave and  comely Personage how majestically slow he walks he is indeed a very admirable Man  SCENE V  Physician Old Man  Physician  You were speaking to me about the Sickness of your Soninlaw explain it to me now with more Clearness let me know all the Symptoms what is the Disease that he is afflicted with is he tormented by Phantoms Spectres or Hobgoblins has he the Distemper of the Goddess  Ceres  upon him conceal nothing is he lethargick hydropical or consumptive 'tis necessary that the Physician shou'd be told every Thing  Old Man  'Tis just the contrary Mr Doctor for I desired you to come hither in order to be informed by you what Distemper my Soninlaw is afflicted with and also with a Hope of having him restored to Health by your Assistance  Physician  Nothing is less difficult believe me good Man your Labour will not be in vain I promise you upon the Faith of a Physician that your Soninlaw shall be cured from this Day  Old Man  I wou'd have him treated with all imaginable Care and nothing spared which may contribute towards the Reestablishment of his Health  Physician  Do not you trouble yourself I will labour upon the Patient with an indefatigable Application I will fatigue myself so much with my Endeavours to restore him that I will sigh six hundred Times a Day through Weariness  Old Man  Hold Sir there is your Patient coming towards us  Physician  Softly let us observe him let us see a little what he will do  SCENE VI  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  the old Man his Fatherinlaw and the Physician  MENAECHMUS  By  Pollux  I certainly rose to Day under a malignant Influence a miserable Day has it been to me this rascally Parasite has discovered all my Secrets this Rogue this Monster of Ingratitude has in a Moment plunged me into Infamy and Fear him who was my  Ulysses  to whom I entrusted all my Designs  the Guide and Executioner of all my Schemes he has betrayed his Agamemnon and by his Perfidy drawn me out of a most sweet and happy Situation If I live I will take away his Life but I talk like a Fool is it not from my Benevolence that he holds his Life is he not supported by my Wealth wou'd he not have perish'd a hundred Times by Hunger but for me 'tis thus then that I will take away his Life I will deprive him of my Assistance As for this Whore she maintains very well the Honour of her Character she does nothing unworthy her honest Profession I intreated her to return me the Robe that I might pacify my Wife with it mark her extream Cunning and the Lye she invented immediately to keep it She swears to me that she gave it me some Hours agoIs it possible to carry Impudence farther than this Alas it must be confest I am extremely miserable  Old Man  Do you hear what he says  Physician  He deplores his Unhappiness  Old Man  Be so good to accost him  Physician  Mr  Menaechmus  your Servant pray why do you stretch yourself thus you are not sensible of the Hurt it does you This Extension  of your Arms encreases the Violence of your Distemper  MENAECHMUS  What does this Quack mean go hang thyself with thy Doctorial Visions  Physician  Do you feel any Thing  MENAECHMUS  Why shou'd I not feel I have all my five Senses  Physician  It will cost more than an Acre of Helebore to cure this Head but let's try him again Well Sir what good News can you tell us  MENAECHMUS  What wou'd you have me to tell you  Physician  Answer precisely to the Question I ask you is the Wine you commonly drink White or Red  MENAECHMUS  May the Furies carry thee away with thy impertinent Curiosity  Physician  By  Hercules  his Madness begins to seize him he grows wild  MENAECHMUS  Why do you not ask me whether the Bread I generally eat is Purple Red or Yellow or enquire if the Birds which are served up to my Table have Scales or the Fish Wings  Old Man  Good Gods what Extravagancies he utters do you not mark him Doctor haste then and make him swallow some salutary Potion before his Distemper increases and he becomes quite furious  Physician  Have Patience be silent I want to interrogate him a little longer  Old Man  Aye aye according to the laudable Customs of your Art you murder the poor Patients with the Gravity of your nonsensical Speeches  Physician  Tell me do not you feel your Eyes grow hard  MENAECHMUS  Do you take me for a Grasshopper  Physician  Don't you perceive that your Bowels make a great Noise  MENAECHMUS  Wh  Bell  is full my Bowels are very peacea  d sleep profoundly but when I  they growl horribly  Physician  This Answer is wide from the Purpose it denotes a distemper'd Brain When you are in B  d do you sleep easily are not your Slumbers unquiet and interrupted do you generally sleep till Day  MENAECHMUS  I always sleep well but when my Mind is disturb'd by the Fear of some importunate Creditor But may  Jupiter  and all the Gods confound thee thou eternal Questioner when wilt thou have done  Physician  Oh oh our Man begins to grow furious these Words alone ought to be sufficient to make you be on your Guard  Old Man  You are mistaken he is calmer at present and less abusive than he has been since his Senses were first disordered it is not long since he called his Wife an enraged Bitch  MENAECHMUS  By your Leave pray when did I use such a Word  Old Man  I say you are mad my Friend quite mad and fit for Chains  MENAECHMUS  How mad am I mad  Old Man  Yes you have you not threatened to crush me under the Wheels of your Chariot had I not heard your Extravagancies with my own Ears I would not thus freely have call'd you mad  MENAECHMUS  And with the same Certainty I know that you have stolen the sacred Crown of  Jupiter  and that for this horrible Sacrilege you was thrown into Prison from whence you are now taken out to be hang'd I know also that you have stabb'd your Father and sold your Mother for a Slave Well Fatherinlaw do I speak now like a Man in my Senses is it not fit to answer Calumny with Calumny and false Imputations with others as false and more attrocious  Old Man  Doctor I conjure you lose no Time what you are to do do quickly See you not how he is transported  Physician  The best Thing you can do is to send the Patient to my House  Old Man  Is this your Opinion  Physician  Certainly he will then be wholly under my Care and I may treat his Distemper my own Way  Old Man  Do what you think most proper to be done  Physician  Come Mr  Menaechmus  come along with me I will regale you well for these twenty Days to come you shall drink nothing but Helebore is not that fine  MENAECHMUS  Rascal I will cut thy Throat  Physician  Come venerable Father let us go and get some People to carry him to my House  Old Man  How many are necessary  Physician  His Distemper is so violent at present that no fewer than four lusty strong Fellows will be necessary to carry him away  Old Man  They shall be here in a Moment mean  Time good Mr  Esculapius  watch your Patient carefully don't let him escape  Physician  I watch him excuse me Sir I have very urgent Business nay you know I am obliged to go home and give the necessary Orders for his Reception Go go send the Slaves hither and let them bring him to my House immediately  Old Man  He shall be there as soon as you  Physician  I'll be gone then  Old Man  Adieu  SCENE VII  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  alone  So they are gone my Fatherinlaw and the Physician and I am at last delivered from their Hands Great  Jupiter  what Adventure is to follow those which have happened to me this Day They declare publickly here that I am mad it passes for certain so there is the Reputation and Honour of my poor Brain dead and buried But how can this be for I am very sure that since my first Entrance into Life I have never been seiz'd with any  Symptoms of this Distemper Is this black Suspicion owing to Malice or Mistake 'Tis strange 'tis unaccountable surely I am not mad I neither insult quarrel with or strike any Persons that come in my way my Mind is calm my Thoughts are reasonable my Behaviour is not different from other People when I speak to them they reply when they speak to me I answer them again and with as much Judgment as ever I did before 'Tis not I then that am mad but those who reproach me with Madness have their own Brains cracked People that labour under such Disorders suspect others to be what they are themselves  But this is not all that afflicts me for how shall I dispose of myself at present to which Side shall I turn I dare not attempt to get into my own House for my Lamb of a Wife will refuse me Entrance and from my Mistress nothing is to be expected her Door is shut against me no one will venture to introduce me we are upon such bad Terms with each otherI have no other Resource but to wait here for the Approach of Night my Wife perhaps may be then seiz'd with Compassion and will permit me to take Part of her Bed  SCENE VIII  MESSENION  The Merit of a good Slave consists in taking great Care of his Master's Substance in laying it out wisely in being attentive to his  Interests in short a good Slave shou'd in his Master's Absence manage his Money in the same Manner as if he was present or rather with more Circumspection  A wise Domestic will always consider his Shoulders more than his Mouth he will think it more necessary to provide for the Ease of his Legs than for the filling his Belly and have the Reward he expects from his Master continually before his Eyes But what is the Reward that a wicked idle Slave has Reason to hope for in what Coin is he paid why with heavy Stripes Fetters grinding in Mills cruel Fatigues ravenous Hunger and perishing Cold these are the natural Consequences of Disobedience and Guilt  As for me I am a declared Enemy to all these Things there is not one of them convenient not one that suits my Taste or does not put me into a horrible Fear 'tis for this Reason that I am firmly resolved to be good for something and always prefer good Service to bad I am not moved by harsh Language or Reproaches however undeserved for after all they are only Words and Words strike nothing but the Air but as for Blows your humble Servant I am not for them I hate them mortally the Impression they make is a little too strong  I must confess also that I eat much more willingly what the Labours of others supply me with than my own Bread made with Flower of my Grinding wou'd taste very bitter  but it goes down very pleasantly when done by the Fatigue of my Comrades Therefore I am always ready to obey my Master's Commands I execute his Orders punctually I serve him with Diligence and Alacrity and I find myself in a very happy Situation with these my servile Maxims  Those Slaves who because of their good Behaviour have nothing to fear and yet are naturally timid those Slaves I say are generally most useful to their Masters on the contrary those who are bold determined and arrogant are the greatest Tremblers in the World when by their Faults they have drawn the Indignation of their Masters upon them  Thanks to the Gods I have no Reason to be afraid my Master will in a little Time reward me for my faithful Service in the mean Time this is my governing Principle to do always what is most for the Ease of my Back  After having secured my Master's Servants and Baggage in the Inn as he commanded me I came back to wait his Orders 'tis fit I knock at the Door that he might be informed that I am here Oh that I may be so happy as to see him come out safe and sound from this damn'd House but I fear I am come too late and that it will be after Death the Physician  SCENE IX  The Old Man MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  Slaves MESSENION  Old Man  To the Slaves  I conjure you by the Gods and by Men not to neglect any of my Orders carry him immediately to the Physician's House I have commanded you to do it and I now repeat my Command obey then as you ought unless your Backs and your Thighs are of little Consideration to you Do not be frighted from your Duty by his MenacesWell why do you stand still why fix yourselves like Statues in one Posture is it thus you obey my Orders you ought already to have laid him across your Shoulders make Haste I will go before you to the Physician's  MENAECHMUS  I am undone what can this mean Rascals why do you fall upon me what do you want why do you surround me thus voracious Birds of Prey whither do you want to convey me Ah I am ruin'd Help dear FellowCitizens of  Epidamnum  I implore your Relief hasten to my Assistance and deliver me from these Bloodhounds  MESSENION  Immortal Gods what do I see Oh Misery my Master my good Master treated with  the vilest Indignity by all the Furies they want to carry him away by Force  MENAECHMUS  Ah what brave Man will have Courage enough to embrace my Interests and undertake my Defence  MESSENION  I will my dear Master I will defend you while I have one Drop of Blood remaining Oh wicked Attempt Oh execrable Villany Ye Citizens of  Epidamnum  will ye suffer an honest free Stranger to be treated like a Slave and a Criminal in the midst of your Streets and in a City that is at Peace with all the World Can any Thing dishonour you more Be gone ye Ministers of Perfidy and Violence and release the Innocent whom you oppress  MENAECHMUS

Master at Liberty  MENAECHMUS  By  Pluto  I have got this Rogue's Eye in my Hand  MESSENION  Good very good he has something to remember you by Off off ye Robbers Murderers Villains  Slaves  Mercy for the Love of the great  Hercules  Mercy  MESSENION  Leave this Gentleman then  MENAECHMUS  Strike strike have no Compassion on them who had the Insolence to seize me  MESSENION  If you wou'd have me spare you fly leave this Place be gone this Instant and may the Gods punish ye Villains as ye deserve How what makes you lag behind your Fellows there take that for being the hindmost by  Hercules  a good Blow thy Face is in admirable Order and now I am satisfied my Work is done Faith Sir I came in  good Time you began to want my Assistance  MENAECHMUS  May the Gods be favourable to thee always generous Stranger for 'tis certain without thy Assistance this Day had been fatal to me I shou'd not have lived till Sunset  MESSENION  Then Sir I may hope you will reward my Service with that good which exceeds every other Liberty  MENAECHMUS  Must I make thee free Friend  MESSENION  Yes certainly you my Master since you acknowledge I have saved your Life  MENAECHMUS  Is it me you call Master you are deceived and take me for some other Person  MESSENION  How can I be deceived how can I take you for another Person I do not understand you Sir  MENAECHMUS  I swear by the Father of the Gods I am not your Master  MESSENION  Good Sir do not talk in this Manner  MENAECHMUS  I tell you I am not your Master I never had a Slave capable of doing what you have done for me  MESSENION  If you will not acknowledge me for your Slave give me Liberty to go where I please  MENAECHMUS  By  Hercules  I will enfranchise thee as far as it is in my Power be free my Friend and go where thou wilt  MESSENION  Do you command me to do so Sir  MENAECHMUS  Yes by  Hercules  I command thee by all the Authority I have over thee  MESSENION  Oh my good my worthy Master I will serve you still faithfully in the Character of your new freed Man  A Slave  Companion of MESSENION  I congratulate you  Messenion  upon the Liberty you have acquir'd  MESSENION  By  Hercules  my Friend I do not in the least doubt but that your Congratulation is  sincere But Sir I must intreat you will grant me one Favour and that is that you will continue to command me any Thing for your Service with the same Authority as when I was your Slave I will stay with you and when you return home I will follow you  MENAECHMUS  No that must not be  MESSENION  I will go immediately to the Inn and bring the Baggage and Money your Purse is seal'd and put into your Portmantua I will deliver it into your Hands  MENAECHMUS  Do so thou art a brave Fellow  MESSENION  I will give you back the Purse in the same Condition as when you confided it to my Care Have a little Patience and wait for me here  MENAECHMUS  What am I to think of all this what wonderful Accidents have happened to me this Day Some will not acknowledge me but impudently maintain that I am what I am not and from thence take Occasion to shut me out of my House others pretend notwithstanding all my Assurances to the contrary that I am their Master The Man who has just left me wou'd engage himself  to all the Furies in Hell that he is my Slave and therefore I must give him Freedom the Madman has promised me a Purse full of Money if he keeps his Word I shall very chearfully take Leave of him I will throw the Reins over his Neck and suffer him to go where he pleases for to be plain I shall be afraid that when he is restor'd to his Senses he will remember the Money he has given me and demand it back again perhaps with Interest too My Fatherinlaw and the Physician treat me like a Madman from whence can it proceed I am wrapt in Wonder at it Let me consider am I awake or is all this a VisionNo 'tis but too certain what then shall I do after so many Storms I believe I cannot do better than to go to this Courtezan and by Prayers and Flatteries prevail upon her to give me back the Robe if I should have the Goodluck to succeed with this Woman who like all the rest of her Trade is true to her own Interest I will carry it home immediately and do not doubt but with such a Passport I shall gain Admittance and restore Peace again to my Family  SCENE X  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES MESSENION  MESSENION  Hast thou the Impudence to persist in saying thou hast seen and spoke to me a few Minutes ago Was there ever a more infamous  Falshood I indeed commanded thee to come and fetch me or at least to meet me here neither of which thou didst thou wert taken up I suppose with some more agreeable Business  MESSENION  Is it possible Sir that you can speak so contrary to your own Knowledge certainly you mean to divert yourself for you cannot have forget the Service I did you just now Did I not deliver you from four great Mastiffs who were carrying you away by Force You stormed you cried aloud for Succour and called both Gods and Men to witness the horrible Violence that you suffered in vain you struggled to free yourself from their Arms I was destin'd to be your Deliverer finding you in this Danger I ran I flew to your Assistance I fell furiously upon your Ravishers and by a Shower of dreadful Blows I forced them to fly thus I again made you Master of yourself and restored you to Liberty This Action which shew'd my ardent Zeal for your Safety moved your Heart you thought and with Reason that you cou'd not reward so important a Service with less than Liberty therefore you made me free  MENAECHMUS  How have I made you free have I permitted you to go where you please  MESSENION  There is nothing more certain  MENAECHMUS  And I protest that it has been long my Resolution rather to sell myself for a Slave than give you Freedom How will you reconcile these Contradictions  SCENE XI  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES MESSENION  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  speaking as he comes out of EROTIA's House  By  Hercules  though you shou'd swear by all that is most dear to you that I have carried away the Robe and the Bracelet it would nevertheless be false you are all villainous Lyars  MESSENION  Oh Heaven oh ye immortal Gods what do I behold  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  What is it you see  MESSENION  Your living Mirror Sir  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  What dost thou mean by that  MESSENION  Your other Self never was there so perfect a Resemblance  MENAECHMUS  By  Pollux  if the Idea I have of my own Figure be true this Man is not different from myself  MENAECHUMS of  Epidamnum  Well met again young Man who ever thou art I shall look upon thee as my Deliverer  MESSENION  I conjure you Sir by the great  Hercules  tell me your Name  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  My Name is  Menaechmus  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  By the Temple of  Pollux  that is my Name also  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  I am of  Syracuse  in  Sicily  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  There was I also born and in that City am I settled  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  What is it you say  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  Nothing but Truth  MESSENION  That I can witness for I ought to know this Gentleman well since I am one of his Slaves Aye this is my Master but in good Faith I have taken you for him and firmly believed I belonged to you This Mistake has been the Cause of my giving my Master Offence and letting some imprudent and disrespectful Words escape me for which I most humbly ask your Pardon Master  To  Menaechmus  of  Epidamnum  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  Sure thou art mad hast thou forgot that this Day you landed with me at  Epidamnum  MESSENION  Very true Sir Yes without doubt 'tis you that are my Master and as for you young Gentleman with the deceitful Appearance you must seek another Slave I must bid you adieu my new Master for I insist upon it that this is the true  Menaechmus  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  And I insist upon it that 'tis I who am  Menaechmus  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  What Farce are we playing here you are  Menaechmus  you say  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  Yes I say I am  Menaechmus  the Son of  Moschus  a Citizen of  Syracuse  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  How are you the Son of my Father  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  Not that I know of young Man I am the Son of my own Father and in naming him I had no Design of claiming yours  MESSENION  Immortal Gods accomplish I beseech you my Hope although it be almost against Hope itself yet oh may it please you to confirm my Conjecture These two if I am not deceived are the twin Brothers of  Syracuse  I must consult with my Master Mr  Menaechmus  Both  What woudst thou  MESSENION  I speak but to one at a Time answer me which of you two have wandered a long Time with me on the Sea  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  Not I  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  No certainly for it was me  MESSENION  Then 'tis with you I wou'd speak be so good to come aside with me  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  Well what hast thou to say to me now  MESSENION  One of these two Things must certainly be true either this Man is an Impostor and a Cheat or he is your twin Brother for my Part I must confess the more I examine him the more I am lost in Astonishment I never in my whole Life beheld a Man who so perfectly resembled another as he does you believe me Sir for of this I am a better Judge than you one Drop of Water is not more like another besides he says he is of the same City and Country as you are therefore if you think proper we will interrogate him on some Facts  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  By  Hercules  thy Advice is good and I am much obliged to thee go on I conjure thee in the Name of the Gods to clear up this Affair and if thou provest him to be my Brother I will reward thee with Liberty  MESSENION  I am in great Hopes of being able to give you this Satisfaction my Heart whispers Success to me  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  I will patiently wait the Event  MESSENION  Well Sir you who would make us believe you to be  Menaechmus  will you maintain it  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  Yes and I will say nothing but what is true  MESSENION  'Tis certain that my Master's Name is  Menaechmus  you say you are of  Syracuse  in  Sicily  in that City was he born  Moschus  you tell us was your Father so was he my Master's are you willing to give me your Assistance in clearing up this Matter to the Satisfaction of you both  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  Well dost thou deserve that I should comply with all thy Demands and although I am free yet will I blindly obey thee as if thou hadst bought me for thy Slave  MESSENION  I do not doubt but that you will be found to be the Twin Brothers of  Syracuse  born in one Day of the same Father and Mother  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  Your Words surprize me you fill me with Astonishment and Joy May the Gods grant that you may be able to prove this clearly to me  MESSENION  Well then stand by each other and both of you answer precisely to the Questions I shall ask you  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  Ask what you please I promise to answer you truly  MESSENION  Are you call'd  Menaechmus  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  'Tis my true and only Name  MESSENION  And yours also Sir  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  Nothing is more certain  MESSENION  You declare yourself the Son of  Moschus  who when alive was a good and honest Citizen of  Syracuse  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  I repeat that Declaration  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  The same  Menaechmus  was my Father also  MESSENION  You are then a  Syracusan  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  Certainly  MESSENION  And you also my Master  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  Yes thou knowest it  MESSENION  Hitherto all goes Right your Answers agree perfectly well but for a greater Confirmation I beseech you Sir the Citizen of  Epidamnum  that you will be pleased to tell us what you remember at the greatest Distance of Time  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  I remember that my Father took me with him to  Tarentum  whither he went to trade at our Arrival we stood to behold some Games that were celebrating and I lost my Father in the Croud I wandered about and at last fell into the Hands of a rich Citizen of this Place who stole me away and brought me here to  Epidamnum  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  Supreme and all powerful  Jupiter  bless me and crown thy Work  MESSENION  Have Patience Master do not interrupt me How old were you when your Father took you with him to  Tarentum  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  Seven Years I remember I was then geting  new Teeth After this Adventure happened to me I never more saw my Father  MESSENION  How many Brothers were of you in the Family  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  We were but two as I remember  MESSENION  Which of you was the eldest  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  I think we were of the same Age  MESSENION  How can that be  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  'Tis not difficult to guess we were Twins  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  The Gods at last are favourable  MESSENION  I assure you Sir if you interrupt me again I will not ask him any more Questions I will be silent  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  I had much rather be silent myself  MESSENION  There yet remains one Difficulty which I  am afraid will not be easy to get over How happens it that your Brother and you have the same Name  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  I don't know that we have as for myself I am called  Menaechmus  and I was always called so but my Brother had another Name which if I remember right was  Sosicles  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  Ah 'tis too much one half of these Proofs had been sufficient to convince me I cannot any longer contain my fraternal Tenderness I must embrace him my dear Brother my Twin Brother I I am  Sosicles  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  But why are you call'd  Menaechmus  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  When the Family was inform'd that our Father was dead and that you was lost our Grandfather who always loved you more than me supprest my Name and gave me yours  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  I believe all you tell me one little Scruple remains which I beg you to remove  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  Most w  llingly speak  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  What was our Mother's Name  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  Theusimarcha  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  The same come to my Arms my dear Brother whom for so many Years I have not seen and whom I never thought to have seen again how happy has this unexpected Meeting made me  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  And oh how has it blest me me my dear Brother who have sought thee so long a Time with incredible Labour and Fatigues but now they are all overpay'd  MESSENION  Now Master the Behaviour of the Courtezan is explained she called you by your Name and invited you to Dinner believing you to be your Brother  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  By the Temple of  Pollux  I had ordered her to prepare a Repast and intended to dine with her nay I gave her a Robe which I stole to Day from my Wife  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  Is not this the Robe you speak of Brother  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  By what Chance did it come into your Possession  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  The Woman who lives in that House invited me to dine with her she assured me that I had given her this Habit I was very well entertained eat and drank plentifully and to compleat my good Fortune brought the Robe away with me  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  By the Temple of  Pollux  I am rejoiced that you fared so well upon my Account this Creature when she invited you in certainly mistook you for me  MESSENION  Well the Affair is now finish'd I have fulfilled my Engagement 'tis now your Turn Sir to perform your Promise by giving me my Liberty  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  His Demand is too just and reasonable to be refused come Brother make him free for my sake  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  You are in the right my Brother to believe that your Mediation must be dear to me Well  Messenion  to comply with my Promise and more especially to gratif my other Self I make you free from this Instant  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  I sincerely congratulate thee  Messenion  on thy Liberty  MESSENION  May the Gift be made me under happier Auspices than it was before that my Liberty may be as durable as my Life  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  Since we have thus happily met contrary to all Expectation I intreat you Brother to quit  Epidamnum  and let us return together to our dear Country  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  I will do whatever you please from henceforward I hope our Inclinations will be as like as our Persons All my Possessions here shall be sold in the mean Time let me make you known to my Eriends and find out if possible some Means of distinguishing us from each other come walk into my House  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  With all my Heart I'll follow you every where  MESSENION  Stay Gentlemen I have a Favour to beg of you be so kind as to prefer the Office of public Crier on this Occasion upon me  MENAECHMUS SOSICLES  'Tis granted  MESSENION  If you please then I will begin from this  Time to publish the Sale on what Day shall I fix it  MENAECHMUS of  Epidamnum  The seventh  MESSENION  On the seventh Day from this in the Morning will be sold all the Goods moveable and immoveable of Mr  Menaechmus  his Estates Slaves and Houshold Furniture for ready Money only and if a Purchaser can be found for her he will also fell his Wife The whole will certainly amount to no less than two Hundred Thousand Crowns And now farewel Spectators favour us with your Applause  End of the Fifth and last Act  OBSERVATIONS  on the Use  Shakespear  has made of the  Menaechmus  of  Plautus  in his  Comedy of Errors  SHAKESPEAR  's  Comedy of Errors  has been generally allowed to be founded on the  Menaechmi  of  Plautus  Mr  Langbain  in his Account of the Dramatic Poets says that if it be not a just Translation of it it is at least a Paraphrase and in his Opinion far beyond a Translation called  Manaechmus  Printed at  London    From this Translation of  Plautus  's  Menaechmi Shakespear  certainly borrowed his  Comedy of Errors  but not being able to procure a Copy of it and being wholly unacquainted with the  Latin  Tongue I have turned Monsieur  Gueudiville  's  French  Translation of the  Menaechmi  into  English  which although as I am informed it be not very literal as to the Dialogue yet the Plot the Incidents and Characters being exactly the same with the  Latin  Poet's it will serve to shew how much of the Plot  Shakespear  has borrowed in his  Comedy of Errors  That we may be the better able to trace him in his Imitations it will be necessary to examine the  Comedy of Errors  Scene by Scene and take the Story a little higher than the Commencement of the Action of the Play  The Cities of  Syracuse  and  Ephesus  being at War with each other a Law was made in both by which it was provided that if any  Ephesian  Merchant was seen to traffic in  Syracuse  or any  Syracusan  Merchant in  Ephesus  his Goods should be confiscated and himself condemned to Death  An old Merchant of  Syracuse  named  Aegeon  landing at  Ephesus  is apprehended upon this Law  Here the Action of the Play begins as  Aegeon  is leading to Prison the Duke of  Ephesus  meeting him demands the Cause of his having left his native Country and coming to  Ephesus Aegeon  thereupon gives a long Account of himself and his Family which in order to understand well the following Incidents I will transcribe  In  Syracusa  was I born and wed  Unto a Woman happy but for me  And by me too had not our Hap been bad  With her I liv'd in Joy our Wealth increas'd  By prosperous Voyages I often made  To  Epidamnum  'till my Factor's Death  And he great Store of Goods at random leaving  Drew me from kind Embracements of my Spouse  From whom my Absence was not six Months old  Before herself almost at fainting under  The pleasing Punishment that Women bear  Had made Provision for her following me  And soon and safe arrived where I was  There she had not been long but she became  A joyful Mother of two goodly Sons  And which was strange the one so like the other  As could not be distinguish'd but by Names  That very Hour and in the selfsame Inn  A poor mean Woman was deliver'd  Of such a Burthen MaleTwins both alike  Those for their Parents were exceeding poor  I bought and brought up to attend my Sons  My Wife not meanly proud of two such Boys  Made daily Motions for our home Return  Unwilling I agreed alas too soon  We came aboard  A League from  Epidamnum  had we sail'd  Before the alwaysWindobeying Deep  Gave any tragic Instance of our Harm  But longer did we not retain much Hope  For what obscured Light the Heavens did grant  Did but convey unto our fearful Minds  A doubtful Warrant of immediate Death  Which though myself would gladly have embrac'd  Yet the incessant Weeping of my Wife  Weeping before for what she saw must come  And piteous Plainings of the pretty Babes  That mourn'd for Fashion ignorant what to fear  Forc'd me to seek Delays for them and me  And this it was for other Means were none  The Sailors sought for Safety by our Boat  And left the Ship then sinkingripe to us  My Wife more careful for the elder born  Had fasten'd him unto a small spare Mast  Such as Seafaring Men provide for Storms  To him one of the other Twins was bound  Whilst I had been like heedful of the other  The Children thus dispos'd my Wife and I  Fixing our Eyes on whom our Care was fixt  Fasten'd ourselves at the End of either Mast  And floating streight obedient to the Stream  Were carry'd towards  Corinth  as we thought  At length the Sun gazing upon the Earth  Disperst those Vapours that offended us  And by the Benefit of his wish'd Light  The Seas wax'd calm and we discover'd  Two Ships from far making amain to us  Of  Corinth  that of  Epidauris  this  But ere they cameOh let me say no more  Gather the Sequel by what went before  DUKE  Nay forward old Man do not break off so  For we may pity tho' not pardon thee  AEGEON  Oh had the Gods done so I had not now  Worthily term'd them merciless to us  For ere the Ships could meet by twice five Leagues  We were encounter'd by a mighty Rock  Which being violently borne upon  Our helpless Ship was splitted in the midst  So that in this unjust Divorce of us  Fortune had left to both of us alike  What to delight in what to sorrow for  Her Part poor Soul seeming as burden'd  With lesser Weight but not with lesser Woe  Was carry'd with more Speed before the Wind  And in our Sight they three were taken up  By Fishermen of  Corinth  as we thought  At length the other Ship had seiz'd on us  And knowing whom it was their Hap to save  Gave helpful Welcome to their shipwreck'd Guests  And would have rest the Fishers of their Prey  Had not their Bark been very slow of Sail  And therefore homeward did they bend their Course  Thus have you heard me sever'd from my Bliss  Thus by Misfortunes was my Life prolong'd  To tell sad Stories of my own Mishaps  DUKE  And for the Sakes of them thou sorrow'st for  Do me the Favour to dilate at full  What hath befall'n of them and thee till now  AEGEON  My youngest Boy and yet my eldest Care  At eighteen Years became inquisitive  After his Brother and importun'd me  That his Attendant for his Case was like  Rest of his Brother but retain'd his Name  Might bear him Company in quest of him  Whom whilst I labour'd for a Love to see  I hazarded the Loss of whom I lov'd  Five Summers have I spent in farthest  Greece  Roaming clean through the Bounds of  Asia  And coasting homeward came to  Ephesus  Hapless to find yet loth to leave unsought  Or that or any Place that harbours Men  But here must end the Story of my Life  And happy were I in my timely Death  Could all my Travels warrant me they live  Here ends the first Scene the Appearance of  Aegeon  is of no other Use than to tell the Spectators several Circumstances antecedent to the Action of the Play which it is necessary they should be acquainted with this  Plautus  does in his Prologue  The Story though borrowed from  Plautus  is yet very different the Circumstance of two Brothers being so extremely like each other that it was impossible to distinguish them is highly improbable in the  Latin  Poet  Shakespear  however doubles the Miracle and presents us with two Pair of Twins instead of one with the same wonderful Resemblance  Plautus  accounts very naturally for the Brothers having both the same Name the Grandfather upon the Loss of the eldest whom he loved best to preserve the Remembrance of him gives his Name to the youngest  Shakespear  without assigning any Reason for it makes the Twin Sons of  Aegeon  be both called  Anthipholis  and the Twin Brothers their Slaves both  Dromio  The Separation of the Husband and Wife and their Children from whence all the diverting Mistakes in the  Comedy of Errors  arise is brought about without the least Regard to Probability  Aegeon  sails from  Syracuse  to  Epidamnum  to settle his Affairs there which were left in Confusion by the Death of his Factor and his Wife though near the Time of her Lyingin follows him for no Reason indeed but to be delivered at an Inn where a poor Woman who like her having born two Male Twins she may buy them for Slaves to her own Sons and that returning to  Syracuse  they may be shipwrecked and separated from each other  When the Storm arises the Merchant and his Wife who as it shou'd seem have a View to the diverting Perplexities which are to follow fasten one  Antipholis  and one  Dromio  together so when the Ship splits they are very conveniently separated Had they like other fond Parents been more sollicitous for the Preservation of their own Offspring than their little Slaves and used their joint Endeavours for that Purpose only the Father and Mother and their Twin Sons might have been all taken up together by the  Corinthian  Vessel but thus equally dividing their Affection between their Children and their Slaves and that excellent Contrivance of fastening a Twin of each Sort together occasioned their falling into different Hands and gave to each  Antipholis  his  Dromio  for the future Business of the Play  The Mother and the elder  Antipholis  being separated he and his little Slave  Dromio  are carried to  Ephesus  where in Process of Time he is married to a rich Lady and settles there Here the younger  Antipholis  comes to seek for his Brother and his Father afterwards for him the old Man is immediately seized and condemned to die as has been mentioned but the Duke respites him for the Space of one Day in order to try if he can raise the Sum of one Thousand Marks to buy his Life  In the second Scene  Antipholis  of  Syracuse  makes his Appearance with the Merchant of the City who informing him of what had happened to the  Syracusan  Merchant advises him to give out that he came from  Epidamnum  Antipholis  of  Syracuse  sends his Man  Dromio  with a Thousand Marks to lay up safe at his Inn and being left to himself declares the Cause of his wandering about the World to be the Hopes of finding his Mother and Brother whose Loss he deplores While he is standing in the Street  Dromio  of  Ephesus  comes up to him and taking him for his Master tells him his Dinner is ready and that his Wife waits for him  Antipholis  deceived by the Resemblance supposes this  Dromio  to be his Slave reproves him for his ill timed Jests and asks him where he had left his Money  Dromio  talks of Sixpence he had given him two or three Days ago  Antipholis  asks for his Thousand Marks  Dromio  tells him of his Dinner his House his Wife and presses him to come home  Antipholis  at last in a Fury strikes him  Dromio  runs off and  Antipholis  full of Uneasiness about his Money returns to his Inn to look after it  In the second Act the Scene is the House of  Antipholis  of  Ephesus  his Wife complains to her Sister of her Husband's long Stay and wonders the Slave she sent for him is not returned  Dromio  then enters and humorously repeats what had past between his supposed Master and him declaring that he believes him to be mad the Wife frets and orders him to go back again and fetch him  The Scene changes again to the Street  Antipholis  of  Syracuse  enters and informs the  Audience that his Money is safe and adds  "By Computation and mine Host's Report  "I cou'd not speak with  Dromio  since at first  "I sent him from the Mart"  Yet notwithstanding this Reflexion the Moment his own Slave  Dromio  of  Syracuse  appears he reproaches him with his having denied receiving his Gold and with talking to him about his Wife and a Dinner and though the poor Fellow assures him that he never spoke such Words to him and had not  seen him since he sent him to the Inn till now yet  Antipholis  falls into a Rage and beats him  A Dialogue of Puns and Quibbles ensues between the Master and Man which is interrupted by the Entrance of  Adriana  the Wife of  Antipholis  of  Ephesus  and her Sister  Adriana  this  Antipholis  and this  Dromio  band and his Slave reproaches him with his Neglect of her and intreats him to come home to dinner  Antipholis  protests he does not know her and that he is but just arrived at  Ephesus  the Sister chides him and tells him his Wife had sent for him home to Dinner by  Dromio Dromio  is surprised and denies it  Antipholis  ▪ who had had that Message delivered to him by the other  Dromio  storms at the Slave for lying the Fellow assures him he had never seen her  Antipholis  asks how she could be acquainted with their Names if he had not seen her before and informed her of them  Adriana  vexed at this Jesting as she thinks it intreats  Antipholis  to go home with her and charges  Dromio  to keep the Gate for that Day and let no one in to interrupt them  Antipholis  though amazed to the last Degree at all this resolves at last to  Say as they say and persevere so  "And in this Mist at all Adventures go  In the third Act the Scene is the Street before the House of  Antipholis  of  Ephesus Antipholis  of  Ephesus  and his Slave  Dromio  with a Merchant and a Goldsmith whom  Antipholis  has invited to dine at his House enter  Antipholis  fearing lest his Wife should be angry at his long Stay desires the Jeweller to excuse it by saying that he lingered at his House seeing the making of her Bracelet and chides his Man for having dared to tell him he met him on the Mart and charged him with a Thousand Marks in Gold and with having denied his Wife and House He then knocks at his Door but is refused Entrance  Adriana  who supposes her Husband is dining with her above is surprised at the Fellow below who calls her Wife and insists upon Admittance and renews her Orders to  Dromio  of  Syracuse  to keep the Door shut  A smart Dialogue follows between the two  Dromio  's the one within Doors and the other without the Husband and his Guests not being suffered to enter he resolves to go and dine with a Courtezan at the  Porcupine  and desires the Jeweller to bring the Gold Chain thither to him that as he says he may to spight his Wife bestow it upon the Courtezan and accordingly they all go off  In the next Scene  Antipholis  of  Syracuse  makes Love to  Luciana  Sister to  Adriana  she upbraids him with his Falshood to his Wife he swears he is not married to her Sister and that he cannot be happy without her  Luciana  threatens to acquaint his Wife with his Treachery and leaves him  His Slave  Dromio  then enters and  Antipholis  from the strange Accidents that had happened both to himself and his Slave believing the Place inhabited by Witches resolves to be gone immediately and orders  Dromio  to go to the Harbour and bring him Intelligence if any Bark was to sail that Night telling him he will walk in the Mart till his Return  Dromio  goes away to perform his Commission and the same Moment the Jeweller  Angelo  enters with the Chain and gives it to  Antipholis  of  Syracuse  whom he takes for the other  Antipholis  denies that he had ever ordered such a Chain to be made but the Jeweller insisting that he had and telling him that he will call in the Evening at his House for the Money  Antipholis  offers to pay him immediately lest as he says he should never see the Chain or Money more which the Jeweller refusing and leaving him  Antipholis  goes to the Mart to wait for  Dromio  which ends the third Act  In the fourth Act a Merchant to whom the Goldsmith  Angelo  owes a Sum of Money demands instant Payment or threatens to arrest him by an Officer whom he has with him  Angelo  tells him  Antipholis  owed him just as much Money as he was indebted to him for a Gold Chain which he had delivered to him a Moment ago and desired him to go with him to his House to receive the Money for it  Antipholis  of  Ephesus  and his Slave  Dromio  enter as from the House of the Courtezan where they had dined  Antipholis  orders  Dromio  to go and buy a Rope'send that he may chastise his Wife he says for locking him out of Doors and that in the mean Time he will go to the Goldsmith but seeing him he reproaches him with not bringing the Chain as he had promised  Angelo  desires him to pay the Money for the Chain to the Merchant there present to whom he owes as much  Antipholis  replies that he has not so much Money about him but bids the Jeweller take the Gentleman and Chain to his House and his Wife would pay for it  Angelo  says he gave him the Chain and presses him to pay for it  Antipholis  denies it The Merchant weary of this Altercation arrests the Jeweller and he arrests  Antipholis  Dromio  of  Syracuse  then enters and taking  Antipholis  of  Ephesus  for his Master tells him that a Ship is ready to sail and that he had  carried their Baggage on board as he commanded him  Antipholis  calls him a Madman and asks him for the Rope'send which he had sent him to buy  Dromio  tells him he sent him to the Bay to see if any Bark was ready to sail not for a Rope  Antipholis  in a Passion threatens him with future Punishment and then orders him to go to  Adriana  tell her he was arrested in the Street and give her the Key of his Desk and bid her send the Purse of Ducats that was in it to him  Dromio  remembers that  Adriana  is the Lady with whom they had dined and accordingly he goes thither tells her what had happened and she dispatches him away with the Gold  The Scene then changes to the Street  Antipholis  of  Syracuse  enters alone and a Moment after  Dromio  of  Syracuse  meets him and gives him the Purse  Antipholis  full of Wonder questions his Man about it and he talking enigmatically of Arrests and Durance  Antipholis  thinks him distracted and prays earnestly to be delivered out of that City  The Courtezan then enters and seeing the Gold Chain about  Antipholis  's Neck whom she takes for  Antipholis  of  Ephesus  who had dined with her she requires him to perform his Promise and give her the Chain instead of the Diamond Ring he had taken from her  Antipholis  flies from her and  Dromio  follows  The Courtezan from this strange Behaviour concluding him mad resolves to go to his House and tell  Adriana  that he had forcibly taken her Ring from her hoping to recover it again by this Means She goes out and  Antipholis  of  Ephesus  enters with the Jaylor whom he had desired to accompany him to his own House for Money to release him As they are going thither  Dromio  of  Ephesus  returns with the Rope he had been sent to buy his Master asks him for the Money he went to fetch from  Adriana Dromio  protests he had been sent not for Money but for a Rope'send  Antipholis  violently enraged beats him and whilst he is thus employed his Wife whom the Courtezan had alarmed with an Account of his being mad enters with one  Pinch  a Conjurer whom she employed to cure her Husband of his Frenzy  Antipholis  growing furious at this Treatment his Wife calls for People to bind him the Jaylor opposes it he being his Prisoner but upon  Adriana  's promising to pay him he suffers  Antipholis  to be carried off And as  Adriana  is going out with the rest  Antipholis  and  Dromio  of  Syracuse  enters with their Swords drawn and they supposing him to be the  Antipholis  who they had just before sent away bound crying out for Help and  Antipholis  and  Dromio  again set out for the Port  In the fifth Act the Scene is a Street before a Priory the Jeweller and Merchant who arrested him appear and while they are discoursing about  Antipholis  's denying that he received the Chain  Antipholis  and  Dromio  of  Syracuse  enter  Angelo  seeing him with the Chain about his Neck reproaches him with having denied the Receipt of it and refusing to pay for it  Antipholis  protests he neither denied the one or the other the Merchant hereupon taxes him with Fashood  Antipholis  draws his Sword and as the Merchant and he are fighting  Adriana  enters cries out that he is mad and orders some People she had brought with her to bind both him and  Dromio  and carry them home  Antipholis  and  Dromio  to avoid this take Shelter in the Monastery and immediately the Lady Abbess appears and demands the Cause of the others thronging thither  Adriana  tells her that her Husband who ran into her House is mad and that she wants to have him fetched from thence and carried home The Abbess after cunningly questioning her concerning her Behaviour to her Husband and taking Advantage of her Answers to prove that she had occasioned his Disorders declares that she will not let him depart but undertake the Cure herself  The Duke that Moment who is attending the Execution of old  Aegeon  enters and  Adriana  throwing herself at his Feet demands  Justice against the Abbess whom she accuses of keeping her Husband from her and recounts all the mad Actions he had been guilty of that Day The Duke sends to bid the Lady Abbess come out and answer to this Accusation and in the mean Time a Servant of  Adriana  's enters and tells her that his Master and  Dromio  who had been left bound at home had broken loose and committed the most terrible Outrages on the Doctor and Servants at home  Adriana  who had seen him as she thought go into the Priory a few Minutes before insists upon it that this Report is false when immediately  Antipholis  and  Dromio  of  Ephesus  enter  Antipholis  complains to the Duke of his Wife's having locked him out of Doors she declares that he had dined with her that Day  Antipholis  goes on to relate all that had happened to him The Jeweller the Merchant the Courtezan his Wife and her Sister having been all deceived by the Resemblance of the two  Antipholis  's charge the one they are speaking to with all that had passed between them and the other his occasions a great deal of Confusion and Perplexity Old  Aegeon  on seeing  Antipholis  of  Ephesus  and taking him for his Son  Antipholis  whom he had parted from seven Years before in the Port of  Syracuse  tells the Duke that he has now found a Friend who will pay his Fine and save his Life and accordingly goes up to him and naming him asks him if he does not know his Father  Antipholis  protests he never saw him before the old Man reminds him that it is seven Years since they parted at  Syracuse  and deplores his own Misery in having been so soon forgotten by his own Son  Antipholis  tells him he never saw his Father in his Life nor was ever in  Syracuse  which the Duke confirmed  In the midst of this new Perplexity the Abbess enters with  Antipholis  and  Dromio  of  Syracuse  all stand amazed at the exact Likeness of the two Gentlemen and their Slaves the Abbess spying  Aegeon  owns herself to be  Emilia  his Wife the Mother of those two  Antipholis  's and informs him that she and the elder  Antipholis  with the Twin  Dromio  were taken out of the Sea by Men of  Epidamnum  but that some Fishermen of  Corinth  took away her Son and  Dromio  and left her with the  Epidamniens  that what became of them afterwards she never knew but that herself arrived to the Fortune of being Abbess of that Priory  The two  Antipholis  's being now discovered all the Mistakes which arose from their Resemblance are cleared up  Aegeon  has his Life given him by the Duke and they all go into the Priory to discourse more at large upon their several Fortunes  The Unity of Time is exactly observed in the  Comedy of Errors  the Incidents of this  Play take up the Space of one Day like those of the  Menaechmi  but the Action which in the last is single and the most simple that can possibly be is by  Shakespear  multiplied into several some of which are far from being either probable or necessary He has taken all the Characters in the  Menaechmi  except  Peniculus  the Parasite and the old Man Fatherinlaw to  Menaechmus  of  Epidamnum  and has added several others every one of the Incidents he has likewise made Use of but varied and added Circumstances so freely that his Play seems to be rather an Imitation than as  Langbain  calls it a Translation or Paraphrase of the  Menaechmi  The Addition of the two  Dromio  's increases the Business of the Play but renders the Object still more improbable which is sufficiently so in the  Menaechmi  where but half the Degree of Credulity is necessary to make it be relished  The Mistakes which arise from the Resemblance of the Twins are conducted with much less Art by  Shakespear  than  Plautus  In the  Latin  Poet all appears the Effects of Chance in  Shakespear  of Design the Persons in his Drama are hardly ever introduced with Propriety they appear on the Stage and go off again evidently for no other Purpose than to give Occasion for the Blunders which ensue  Thus  Antipholis  of  Syracuse  being resolved to leave  Ephesus  sends  Dromio  to the Port to see if any Vessel is ready to sail and bids him come to him to the Mart where he will wait his Return accordingly they separate and it may now be reasonably supposed that  Antipholis  is gone thither but instead of that we find him a Scene or two afterwards standing in the same Place where he is met either by the Wife the Friends or the Servants of the other  Antipholis  and after having with great Difficulty disengaged himself from abundance of perplexing Adventures again he declares he is going to the Mart and goes off for that Purpose and again he is found in the same Place to give Rise to new ones  In this Manner the whole Business of the  Comedy of Errors  is conducted Those Errors do not as in the Play which  Shakespear  borrowed from arise out of a natural and probable Succession of Incidents but every Thing is put out of its Course to introduce them and each Error is produced by an Absurdity  The Story of  Amleth  translated from the  Danish  History of  SaxoGrammaticus  _IN the Reign of  Roderic Horwendil  and  Fengo  Sons of  Gerwendil  had the Garrison of  Jutland  committed to them by the King  Horwendil  was the bravest Pirate on the Sea and for the Fame of his Exploits envied by  Coller  King of  Norway  who sailed in pursuit of his Rival they met they fought and the King was slain  The Encounter of these Heroes with the extraordinary Manner of their Meeting each other alone in the Recesses of a Wood with other Circumstances as improbable as any in Romance are related in the true Stile of such Writings by  SaxoGrammaticus  in the third Book of his  Danish  History  After the Death of  Coller  and his Sister  Selam Horwendil  having for three Years given the greatest Proofs of Valour destines his rich Spoils and choice Prey for  Roderic  that he might rise in his Friendship Grown familiar he obtains his Daughter  Geruth  in Marriage and by her had a Son  Amleth  Fengo  fired with Envy at his Brother's Happiness is resolved by Treachery to ruin him So that Virtue is not always secure against the Designs of such as are the nearest to and the most intimate with us For when an Opportunity offered to commit Fratricide he with bloody Hand satiates the dire Lust of his Heart poisoned with Envy and enjoying the Wife of his murdered Brother adds foul Incest to his Fratricide He who submits to one Offence too readily offends again for one Crime is often the Provocation to another  He contrived this Villany with such Art and Impudence as to frame an Excuse for his Guilt from counterfeit Benevolence and give to Fratricide the Colour of Love  Geruth  was of so mild a Disposition as never to give the least Offence and yet he said she had incurred the severest Hatred of her Husband and that he had killed his Brother for her sake and to save her thinking it ungenerous so gentle a Lady and without Gall should endure the extream Moroseness of that Man  His Success was equal to his Wishes for Princes may be deceived and made to believe  Untruths in Courts where Buffoonery is sometimes favoured and malicious Detraction honoured  Fengo  hesitated not with murderous Hands to embrace a Brother's Wife and with equal Villany commits a double Impiety  Amleth  sees this but that he might not raise Suspicions in his Uncle by an over prudent Care for his own Safety puts on the Guise of Folly and feigns himself distracted and by this Sort of Device he not only covers his Design but saves himself He lazily stretched himself out every Day before his Mother's Hearth rolling on the Ground and covering himself with Filth his Face discoloured and besmeared with Gore and Nastiness presented the ridiculous Extravagance of a Natural Whatever he said was like the Ravings of a Madman whatever Action he performed savoured of extream Ignorance In short you would not say he was a Man but a ridiculous Monster produced by Fortune in a Frenzy  Sometimes sitting by the Fire and raking the Embers with his Hand he would make wooden Hooks and harden them in the Fire and fasten the Ends within one another that they might hold more firmly together and when asked what he was about would say he made sharp Spikes to revenge his Father  He was not a little laughed at for this Answer The Vanity of such a ridiculous Performance was treated with Contempt by all  though it afterwards was of Use to him in the Prosecution of his Design  This Ingenuity gave to those of better Judgment the first Suspicion of his Subtilty The latent Ability of the Workman for greater Matters was seen by his Skill in lesser ones Nor could it be thought that his Senses were impaired who by the Work of his Hands discovered such ingenious Artifice Besides he preserved his Heap of Brands that he had burnt at the Points to make them hard with the greatest Care  There were those who asserting that he was of uncommon Strength and Quickness of Parts that he hid his good Sense under the Pretence of Folly and covered the deep Design of his Mind with crafty Invention and that his Advice could not be more readily discovered than by introducing to him at any Time in his Recesses a beautiful Woman who might call forth his Mind to the Allurements of Love  So prone is Nature to the Passion of Love that no Artifice can disguise it and it is too violent to be interrupted by Policy And therefore if his Ignorance were counterfeit he would when Occasion offered yield Obedience to the Power of Love  Certain Companions therefore are employed who should engage him to ride to distant  Parts of the Forest and try him with that Temptation  Amongst them there happened to be a Youth who had the same Nurse with  Amleth  and still preserved in his Heart the Regard that naturally arises in those who are brought up together  He preferring the Remembrance of former Fellowship to the present Charge attends upon  Amleth  with the rest of his appointed Comrades with a Purpose to inform rather than betray him which he could not doubt would happen at last if he discovered the least Sign of a sound Mind and especially if he should openly indulge the Passion of Love  Which was no Secret to  Amleth  himself for when commanded to get on Horseback he purposely seats himself so as to turn his Back to the Horse's Head and face his Tail to which he began to apply the Bridle as if he was by that Part to govern the Speed of his Horse By means of this Contrivance he baffles the Design of his Uncle and defeats his Arts It was very ridiculous to see the Horse go forward without the usual Check of the Reins the Rider directing only the Tail  Amleth  in the Way met with a Wolf amongst the Trees his Companions saying they had met with a young Horse he replied there were few such in  Fengo  's Troops by  this modest and witty Prevarication he rallied the Riches of his Uncle  When they added that he had made a sensible Answer he affirmed that he intended that he might so to do not in any Degree seem to favour a Falshood For desiring to be thought incapable of lying he blended Craft and Truth together that he might not seem entirely to deviate from Veracity in whatever he said nor discover the Richness of his Parts by too much Exactness  Passing along the Shore when his Companions found the Rudder of a shipwrecked Vessel they said they had found a Knife of prodigious Size It is therefore fit says he to cut up a large Ham meaning the Sea indeed to which the Size of the Rudder did well agree Passing also by the sandy Clifts and being directed to look upon the Beach as if it were Corn he said the same was ground by the foaming Billows of the Sea This Answer being commended by his Attendant be assured them it was discreetly said by him  Being left by them on Purpose that he might with greater Freedom indulge his Lust in a private Place he meets a Girl sent by his Uncle as if it were by Chance and would have lain with her had not the Fosterbrother warned him of the Snare by a secret kind of Information  For he considering how he might best discharge the Office of an unknown Monitor to his Friend and prevent the Danger of his wanton Appetite fixed a Straw he found on the Ground in the Tail of a Buzze or Bee flying by and drove him towards the Place where he knew  Amleth  was By this Act he conferred the greatest Benefit on the unguarded Youth  Nor was this Notice more cunningly conveyed than readily understood for  Amleth  seeing the Fly and the Straw that he carried in his Tail and having carefully considered it to be a tacit Admonition to beware of Frauds Alarmed therefore with the Suspicion of injurious Designs against him that he might more securely indulge his Wishes he catching the Girl in his Arms carries her a considerable Distance into a Marsh and unfrequented and after Enjoyment earnestly intreats her not to declare it to any one  With equal Concern therefore is Silence urged and obtained For their being brought up together under the same Guardians from their Infancy produced the greatest Familiarity between her and  Amleth  Upon his Return home being asked by every one whether he had gratified his Lust he owned he had lain with the Girl Being asked again in what Place he had done it or what Pillow he had used answered The Hoof  of an Animal that carries a Burthen  Oestrus or Oestrum has a double Signification either a Gadbee as above or a Coxcomb as in this Place  the Comb of a Cock and under an arched Roof He had put all these Particulars when under Trial that he might avoid the telling a Lie This Account excited much Laughter in those about him although for the Jest sake he did not diminish any Thing of the Truth  The Girl also being questioned kept her Word with him and declared he had done nothing Credit is given her and the rather as it appeared that his Guards knew nothing of the matter Then he who had marked the Buzze for a Token to shew that the Safety of  Amleth  was owing to his Conceit said that he was lately the only one who took Care of him and that the young Man's Answer was to the Purpose  Nor was the Merit of the Token forgot he related how he saw the little Carrier of the Straw with hasty Flight passing near him and that the Straw was stuck in the hinder Parts of his Body As this Relation excited greater Laughter in the rest the Friend of  Amleth  was no less delighted with his Prudence  All of them being defeated and unable to gain Admittance into the Secrets of this young Man's Stratagems one of the Friends of  Fengo  more presumptuous than politic denied  that this unextricable Scheme of Subtilty could be unravelled by common Artifice for he was too obstinate to be moved by Trials of little Moment An ordinary manner of Trial would not reach such Variety of Craft But he had discovered by superior Sagacity a more subtle Manner of trying him not improper for Execution but most effectual for the Discovery of the Thing proposed  The Scheme was this "That  Fengo  should under the Pretence of Business of great Consequence withdraw himself and  Amleth  be shut up with his Mother alone in her Apartment Care being taken to have a Man who unknown to either of them should be placed in some secret Part of the Room unseen to hear attentively whatever passed in Conversation between them For if the Son was really in his Senses he would have no Difficulty in speaking freely to a Mother's Ear nor mistrust the Fidelity of her that bore him And that he might not seem more forward to advise than ready to execute he desired himself to be the Spy  Fengo  approved the Scheme and sets out with the Pretence of taking a long Journey  Mean while the Projector having privately stole to the Chamber where  Amleth  and his Mother were lay hid under the Matt of the Bed  But  Amleth  was not the Dupe of this Treachery For suspecting that he might be overheard by some officious Listener he has at first Recourse to his accustomed Folly and imitates the crowing of a Cock and flapping his Arms as if they were Wings he jumps up and down upon the Bed to try if any Thing lay hid there And when he found a Mass under his Feet he examined the Place with his Sword and stabs the Man who was underneath and dragging him forth put him to Death Cutting the Body in Pieces he boils them and pours them out through the Sewer to be devoured by the Hogs  And thus was the miserable Body rendered undistinguishable from the Dung of the Stye  Having escaped this Snare he returns to his Mother's Apartment and when she with great Lamentation and Tears began to bemoan the want of Understanding in her Son now present "Why O worst of Women says he dost thou endeavour to disguise the foulest Crime under a false Species of Wailing Thou who sporting with the Wantonness of a Strumpet and yielding to the vile and impious Condition of your second Marriage embrace in your incestuous Bosom the Murderer of your Husband and fawn upon and please with lewdest Transport the very Man who put to death the Father of your Offspring so Mares are coupled with Horses that subdued their Foremates It is for Beasts alone to be  dragged to any and to every Male By this Example it appears that you have lost all Memory of your former Husband It is not without Reason that I bear the Resemblance of a Fool for I cannot doubt that he who could destroy a Brother would with like Cruelty rage against his other Kindred It is safer to wear the Garb of Folly than of Sense and I must borrow a Safeguard from the lowest Species of Madness Yet the Care of revenging my Father is ever present to my Mind but I wait for Times and Seasons The same Place suits not with every Scene or Purpose against a dark and cruel Mind much Thought is requisite But for you to lament my Madness is vain when you ought rather to deplore your own Infamy you should therefore not lament another's but your own Failing for the rest be on your Guard and keep the strictest Silence By such Reproach did he endeavour to recall his Heartrent Mother to the Practice of former Habits of Virtue and to teach her to prefer the former Flames of chaster Love to the present criminal Transports"  Fengo  returns and of every one and every where enquires for his injudicious Spy but he is no more to be found nor does any one remember to have seen him  Amleth  in jest is asked whether he could discover any Tracts of him and replies "that he went in at the Sewer fell to the Bostom was kept down by the Mud and devoured by the Hogs who thronged to the Draught" Which Declaration  though true seeming idle and foolish was treated as ridiculous  When  Fengo  no longer doubted of the Subtilty of his Soninlaw he resolved to destroy him but was afraid to execute his Purpose on account of his Grandfather  Roderic  and the Displeasure of his own Wife To cover his Guilt by the Service of another he purposes to have him destroyed by means of the King of  Britain  Thus desirous of concealing his Cruelty he chuses rather to pollute his Friend than to be thought infamous himself  Amleth  departing in secret directs his Mother to furnish the Hall with Hangings well knotted together and at the Expiration of a Year to report him dead and celebrate his funeral Obsequies and at that very time he promises to return  He is attended by two of  Fengo  's Officers bearing Letters inscribed on Wood for that was once a famous Manner of Writing by which it was given in Charge to the King of  Britain  to destroy the young Man that was sent to him  Whilst these Officers slept  Amleth  examining their Baggage discovers these Tablets having read them he rubs out what was written therein and inserting other Characters changes the Tenor of the Mandate from his own Destruction to the Death of his Attendants  Nor satisfied with this Alteration whereby he saves his own Life and exposes that of his Guards he adds as the earnest Entreaty of  Fengo  that the King of  Britain  would bestow his Daughter in Marriage upon that Youth he had sent him who was most wise and prudent  When they came to  Britain  the Envoys waited on the King and presented the Instrument for their own Destruction though they thought it threatned not them but their Companion  The King taking no Notice to them of the Instructions delivered him entertains them with great Magnificence and Hospitality when  Amleth  despising the Splendor of the royal Tables as if they contained but common Food abstains in a surprising Manner from the richest Exhibition of Dainties both in Meats and Drinks  All admired that a Youth of foreign Extract should nauseate the choicest Dainties of the royal Board and most excellent Luxury as if it were coarse and homely Fare  The Banquet ended the King dismissed his Friends that they might retire to Rest but took Care by one sent privately and hid in their Apartments to be informed of the Conversation of his Guests When  Amleth  being asked by his Comrades why he abstained from the Entertainment of Yesterday as from  Poison "replied that the Bread was sprinkled with the Contagion of Blood that the Wine tasted of the Sword that the animal Food savoured of the Corpse of a dead Man and was as offensive as the Smell of a Sepulchre"  He added "that the King had mean Eyes that the Queen in three Instances resembled a Servant" railing not only at the Feast but at the Authors of it  His Companions upbraiding him with his former want of Understanding began to abuse him for having found Fault with approved good Things blamed what was proper and slandered with indecent Language a great King and a Queen of refined Manners and treated with Disgrace and Indignity those who really deserved Applause  Which Circumstances being related to the King by his Officer he declared the Wisdom or Madness of him who had related such Things of more than mortal Growth in so few Words to shew such Extent of Knowledge He sent for the Steward and enquired of him where he had the Bread and when he was told that it was made by the Baker to the Houshold he asked again where the Corn grew and if there was any Sign of human Slaughter in that Place  He answered "that there was a Field not far off covered with the Bones of Men long since slain yet manifestly exhibiting the Remains  of ancient Slaughter which he with Expectation of greater Plenty as the richer Soil had sown with Spring Corn and therefore he did not know whether the Bread might not have contracted a disagreeable Taste"  When the King heard this believing  Amleth  had spoken Truth he took Care to know whence the Bacon came  The Man owned that the Swine straying from his Care had fed upon the Carcase of a Thief and so perhaps the Meat might taste something like Corruption  When the King found that his Opinion was true demanded in this Instaece likewise with what Liquor he had mixed the Drink as he knew it to be made of Corn and Water the Situation of the Spring being shewn him he set about digging and found many Swords eaten with Rust from whence he supposed the Water had contracted that Smell  Others said the Drink was found fault with because in the Draught he had met with Bees that had been bred in the Belly of a dead Man and tasted of Comb By which the King seeing there was sufficient Reason to complain of the Taste of these Things finding that he himself was reproached on account of his Eyes and knowing that this must allude to Baseness of Birth taking his Mother aside demanded of her who was his Father she declaring she knew no other than the King by  threatning her with Death unless she confessed he discovered himself to be the Son of a Servant  Thus by the extorted Confession he came to understand that his Origin which had been reflected on was at least ambiguous He is confounded with Shame at this Discovery of his Condition but no less charmed with the young Man's Wisdom and asked him why he had reproachfully slurred the Queen as one of servile Manners But whilst he laments that the gentle Disposition of his Wife was attacked by the Discourse of his Guest in the Night he learns that her Mother was a waiting Woman and whereas he said she exhibited three Defects of a servile Nature they are these One "that she dressed her Head in the same Manner as Servants do another that she tucked up her Gown in walking the third was that she picked her Teeth with a Skewer and eat the Pickings of them He took Notice that her Mother was reduced to Servitude by becoming a Captive so that she was not less servile in her Birth than her Manners"  Such Sagacity being reverenced by the King as if it were divine he gave him his Daughter in Marriage and received his Affirmation of any Thing as if it bore the Testimony of Heaven But as for his Companions that he might perform the Behest of his Friends he hanged them up the next Day which though an Advantage  Amleth  seemed to resent as an Injury feigning a Distress of Mind and received Money by way of Composition  from the King which he afterwards took Care secretly to melt down and pour into hollow Staves  Having stay'd with him a Year he obtains Leave to depart and returns home again taking nothing out of the Magazine of royal Treasure but the hollow Staves in which he had poured the Gold When he arrived at  Jutland  he resumed his old Behaviour changing his late Elegance for the ridiculous Manner he had before employed And when he entered the Hall covered with Nastiness where the Funeral Rites were celebrated he threw every body into great Amazement because a false Report had been spread of his Death At length their Astonishment was turned into Laughter and the Guests rallied each other upon the Presence of him alive to whom they had performed Honours as dead  When questioned concerning his Companions he said shewing the Staves he held "Here is both the one and the other" which was said with equal Wit and Truth for though it appeared an unmeaning Speech to most who heard it yet swerved not from his customary regard to Truth shewing the Compensation instead of the Men that were executed  Then mixing with the Waiters that he might heighten the Mirth of the Table he supplied them with Liquor with more than ordinary Diligence and that his flowing Habit might not obstruct his moving up and down  he girt it round him with his Belt and often with Design drawing his Sword he cut his Fingers with the Point Care therefore was taken by those about him to fasten his Sword in the Scabbard with a Nail  That he might the more securely effect his Purpose he charged the Nobility with Excess of Liquor till all were overcame with Drinking and unable to walk were obliged to take up their Rest in the Hall and sleep where they had been feasting And when he observed them in a Condition fit for his Designs believing the Execution of it was in his Power he puts the Brands he had formerly prepared into his Bosom and then reentering the Hall where the Nobles lay stretched on the Ground oppressed with Sleep and Surfeit he let fall the Curtain his Mother had wove by cutting the Lines that held it round the sides of the Room which he drew over them and fastened with the Hooks in so artful a Manner that not one of them though he strove with never so much Strength could possibly get up  After this he sets fire to the Room which spreading far and wide soon set the whole House in a Blaze destroyed the Palace and burnt all both those that continued asleep and those who laboured to rise but in vain Thence hasting to  Fengo  's Apartment who had been before conducted thither by his Attendants he took his Sword that hung  by his Bed and put his own in its room then rousing his Uncle he told him that his Nobles were destroyed by Fire that  Amleth  was there and furnished with the Hooks he had formerly made and was now present with him eager to inflict the Vengeance due for his Father's Death  On hearing this  Fengo  jumps from his Bed and was murdered while disappointed of his own he vainly endeavours to draw  Amleth  's Sword O brave Man and worthy everlasting Renown who furnishing himself wisely with counterfeit Folly covered more than human Wisdom under the Guise of a Natural not only secured his own Safety by that Artifice but obtained the Means of compleatly revenging his Father and having so done it is left for every one to judge which was greater his Bravery or Wisdom  The End of the Third Book of the History of  Denmark  by  SAXOGRAMMATICUS  The next Book opens with the Convention of the Nobles before whom  Amleth  making an Oration in which he owns and justifies his Conduct all are moved some to Pity some to Tears and they proclaim him King  After this he repairs to  Britain  to revisit his Wife and Fatherinlaw The King had long been under an Engagement to revenge any Injury to  Fengo  and this prevails over his Affection for a Soninlaw but unwilling to execute  this Vengeance himself he sends him to  Hermutruda  Queen of  Scotland  upon an Embassy to court her for him his Wife being dead and this  Scottish  Lady was reported to be of so cruel a Temper as to put to Death her Suitors but she discovering the Disposition and Actions of  Amleth  loves and prevails on him to marry her  They go to  Britain  his first Wife forgives him and her Father attacking him with his Forces is by the  Danes  defeated and slain  Amleth  returns home again with both his Wives where he finds  Viglet  the Successor of  Roderic  who was dead This new Sovereign had stript his Mother of her royal Treasures and denied the Right of her Son to  Jutland  Amleth  at last is forced to engage him in unequal War and is slain And the fair  Hermutruda  who had taken the Camp and determined to share his Fate willingly yielded herself to the Conqueror's Arms  Viglet  died in Years and was succeeded by  Wermund  OBSERVATIONS  on the Use  Shakespear  has made of the foregoing Story in his Tragedy of  Hamlet  The Fable of the Tragedy of  Hamlet  CLAUDIUS  the reigning King of  Denmark  having secretly murdered his Brother in order to possess himself of his Throne afterwards married his Widow the Ghost of the deceased King appears to some Centinels who were posted on the Platform before the Palace these Soldiers tell  Marcellus  their Officer what they had seen and he acquainting  Horatio  the Friend of  Hamlet  Son to the deceased King with it these two Gentlemen watch one Night on the Platform with an Intention to speak to the Apparition if it should appear The Ghost at the accustomed Hour appears  Horatio  solemnly conjures it to speak and unfold the Cause of its Appearance but the Ghost continues silent and stalks away  Horatio  thereupon resolves to tell  Hamlet  what had happened the Prince full of Grief  for his Father's Death displeased at his Mother's incestuous Marriage and discontented with the Behaviour of his Uncle immediately concludes from this Account of his Father's Spirit appearing that all was not well and declares to his two Friends that he will watch with them that Night on the Platform and speak to the Spirit  Accordingly at Midnight he meets them at the appointed Place and the Ghost soon after appearing  Hamlet  in a most earnest and affecting Manner conjures it to speak and acquaint him with the Cause of its appearing The Ghost beckens him to follow it his Companions apprehending some Danger might happen to his Person endeavour to retain him hut in vain  Hamlet  breaks from them and follows the Ghost who bringing him to a remote Place declares that he is the Spirit of his Father that he was poisoned in his Garden by his Brother who lusted for his Wife and Crown he then charges him to revenge his Murder and vanishes  Hamlet  vows to fulfil his Commands and to conceal the Grief and Indignation which prey upon his Heart and his vowed Purpose of Revenge counterfeits Madness which alarming the guilty King and troubling his Mother they send for two of his Schoolfellows to amuse him and engage him in Diversions to abate the Force of his Melancholy  Polonius  an old Lord very faithful to the King's Interests and whose Daughter  Ophelia Hamlet  is in Love with from her Report of a frantic Visit he made her concludes he is mad for her she having according to his Orders returned his Letters and Presents and refused to hear his Professions as usual  Pollonius  having as he thought discovered the Cause of  Hamlet  's Madness acquaints the King and Queen with his Suspicions  Ophelia  is designedly thrown in his way while the King and  Polonius  conceal themseves to hear their Discourse  Hamlet  after uttering a great many sensible Extravagancies leaves  Ophelia  firmly convinced of his Madness which she affectionately deplores but the King who had heard all his Discourse being persuaded that Love was not the Cause of his Melancholy and that there might be Danger in it resolves to send him to  England  to demand the Tribute the Payment of the Tribute which had been long neglected  Polonius  to whom he communicates this Scheme approves of it but advises that the Queen should first send for him and in a private Conversation intreat him to discover the Cause of his Uneasiness  The King consents mean Time  Hamlet  having engaged some Players to represent a Piece something like the Murder of his Father  invites the King and Queen to the Play and he doubting that the Spirit that appeared to him might be a lying Spirit resoves to make the Play the Test of the King's Conscience he therefore desires his Friend  Horatio  to join with him in carefully observing the King's Countenance during the Representation of one particular Scene which resembles the Circumstance of his Father's Death adding  If his occult Guilt  Do not itself unkennel in one Speech  It it a damned Ghost that we have seen  Accordingly the King is so much struck with that Scene that he rises abruptly and goes out by which  Hamlet  is convinced that the Ghost had told him nothing but Truth The Queen then sends for  Hamlet  with an Intention to question him concerning his late Behaviour and  Polonius  with her Consent conceals himself behind the Arras to hear their Discourse  The Queen being frighted at her Son's rude Treatment of her cries out for Help  Polonius  behind the Arras echoes her and  Hamlet  supposing it was the King who had concealed himself there kills him  After a severe Lecture to his Mother he charges her not to discover that his Madness is feigned declares that he suspects some Treason in the Embassy he is sent on to  England  yet resolves to go and madly takes Leave of the King and her for that Purpose  Ophelia  at the News of her Father's being murdered by  Hamlet  grows distracted her Brother  Laertes  fired by Rage and Grief raises a Mutiny to revenge his Father The King declares that he is innocent of his Father's Death informs him of the Manner of it and joins with him in conspiring the Murder of  Hamlet  Hamlet  suspecting the Letters his two Schoolfellows carried to  England  contained some dangerous Instructions concerning himself steals them and upon examining them finds therein an earnest Request from his Uncle to the King of  England  to put him to Death on his Arrival at his Court  Hamlet  suppresses this Letter and writes another in the Name of his Uncle to the same King in which he desires him to put the Bearers of that Letter to Death this Packet he lays in the Place from whence he had taken the other  The next Day they are attacked by a Pyrate they fight and  Hamlet  boarding it alone is taken Prisoner and his two Companions continue their Voyage to  England  Hamlet  prevails upon the Pirates to land him in  Denmark  the King hearing of his Return urges  Laertes  who breathes nothing but  Revenge against him to kill him treacherously as they are fencing with Foils to which he will engage him by pretending to lay a Wager on his superior Skill at that Exercise  Laertes  consents and adds that he will anoint the Point of his Sword with a strong Poison that if he draws Blood he may be sure to kill him  In the mean Time the distracted  Ophelia  is accidentally drowned the King the Queen and her Brother attend her Funeral As soon as she is laid in the Earth  Laertes  in a Transport of Grief leaps into her Grave  Hamlet  understanding that it is  Ophelia  whom they had buried wildly asserting his Claim as a Lover to superior Sorrow leaps into the Grave likewise where  Laertes  quite overcome with Rage and Grief furiously fastens on him they are with Difficulty parted by the King's Command and some time after the King as if nothing had happened sends a Message to  Hamlet  requesting him to fence with  Laertes  for a considerable Wager  Hamlet  obeys they meet in a Hall the King and Queen being present  The King to make sure Work after drinking  Hamlet  's Health poisons the Wine and offers the Cup to  Hamlet  he refuses it and the Queen not knowing that the Wine is poisoned drinks though the King endeavours to prevent her  Laertes  wounds  Hamlet  with the poisoned Rapier in the Scuffle  they change Weapons and  Hamlet  wounds  Laertes  they both bleed the Queen is seized with the Agonies of Death she tells her Son that the Wine is poisoned and expires  Laertes  full of Remorse for the Treachery he had been guilty of confesses the whole Contrivance and the Part the King had in it  Hamlet  stabs the King with the poisoned Sword that had wounded both him and  Laertes  and upon the King's calling for Help obliges him to drink of the Wine he had poisoned  The King dies and  Hamlet  and  Laertes  exchanging Forgiveness with each other both expire  Hamlet  with his last Breath commanding his Friend  Horatio  who would have killed himself to live and do Justice to his Fame by declaring his Story to the World  The Translation of the Story of  Amleth  from the  Danish  History of  SaxoGrammaticus  I was favoured with by a Friend the Story itself is full of ridiculous Fancies wild and improbable Circumstances and as it is conducted has more the Appearance of a Romance than an Historical Fact  That  Shakespear  founded his  Tragedy of Hamlet  upon it is very plain but is it uncertain whether he saw a literal Translation of it or met with the Incidents drest up like a Novel and perhaps with those Alterations which he has adopted in his Play All the principal Circumstances are the same in the  Play as the History In both a Prince murders his Brother usurps his Dignity and marries his Widow The Son of the murdered Prince resolves to revenge his Father for that Purpose he feigns himself mad and at last accomplishes his Design several of the lesser Circumstances are also as exactly copied and others have afforded Hints for new ones  Amleth  has a private Interview with his Mother and kills the Spy who had been appointed to overhear their Conversation  Hamlet  likewise visits the Queen in her Apartment and kills  Polonius  who had concealed himself behind the Hangings  When the Spies are removed the Discourse of the two Princes is much the same they reproach their Mothers with their incestuous Marriage sharply reprove them for their Crimes declare their Madness to be feigned and enjoin them to Secresy  The Embassy to  England  is designed after the History  Shakespear  indeed makes  Hamlet  after two Days Absence be set on shore again at  Denmark  and  Amleth  in the History arrives in  England  has his Companions hanged and marries the King's Daughter before he comes back But  Shakespear  's Plan required the immediate Return of  Hamlet  however the Contrivance of changing the Letters are the same and of punishing the treacherous Bearers of them  Shakespear  makes  those Bearers the Schoolfellows and profest Friends of  Hamlet  a Circumstance which heightens their Baseness and justifies the Artifice he uses to procure their Punishment  The Design of entrapping  Amleth  by means of a Girl has not been wholly neglected by  Shakespear  though he manages this Incident much more decently  Ophelia  with whom he is in Love is ordered to throw herself in his way and the King and his Confident listen to their Conversation 'Tis very easy to see he took the Hint of this Stratagem from the Story though it is very differently conducted for  Ophelia  is not a loose Wanton as in the History but a Woman of Honour with whom he is in love The accidental killing of her Father and her Distraction which was caused by it is all his own Invention and would have made a very affecting Episode if the Lady had been more modest in her Frenzy and the Lover more uniformly afflicted for her Death for at his first hearing it he expresses only a slight Emotion presently he jumps into her Grave fiercely demands to be buried with her fights with her Brother for professing to love her then grows calm and never thinks of her any more  The Ghost is wholly the Invention of  Shakespear  as is likewise the King's concerted Scheme with  Laertes  to kill  Hamlet  treacherously as they fenced or if he failed to poison the Wine The King is killed by  Hamlet  both in the History and the Play but  in the Play he is stabb'd in the midst of his Friends Guards and Attendants in the History as he is rising in Confusion from his Bed and unable to draw his Sword to defend himself  Here the Historian romantic as his Relation seems has the Advantage of the Poet in Probability After  Amleth  has secured his Uncle's Attendants taken away his Sword from him and placed his own which was fastened to the Scabbard in its stead it was not difficult for him to kill him disarmed and without any Assistance  But  Shakespear  makes  Hamlet  execute his Vengeance on the King in a public Hall crouded with his Attendants and Guards and surrounded by his Friends none of these offer to assist him and  Hamlet  has leisure enough after he has stabbed him to make him drink some of the Wine he had poisoned lest his Sword had not compleated the Work  The Queen's Death by drinking ignorantly of the poisoned Wine is a beautiful Stroke of the Poet's The History shews her unfortunate but  Shakespear  makes the same Man who seduced her to Wickedness be her involuntary Murderer and at once the Cause and Punisher of her Guilt  Shakespear  has with Reason been censured for the Catastrophe of this Tragedy The brave the injured  Hamlet  falls with the Murderers  he punishes one Fate overwhelms alike the innocent and the guilty In the History we find he did not live long after the severe Revenge he took for his Father's Murder but was unfortunately killed in Battle  Shakespear  would not so far deviate from the History as to leave him happy and in Peace though he has hastened his Death as well as changed the Manner of it He is killed by the treacherous Contrivance of the King and  Laertes  is the Instrument of that Treachery which is afterwards turned upon himself  As  Laertes  is a subordinate Character in the Play it seems to be a Fault in  Shakespear  to shew him with a Similitude of Manners under the same Circumstances and acting upon the same Principles as  Hamlet  his Hero  Laertes  is brave and generous his Father is murdered basely as he is informed Duty and Honour incite him to revenge his Death and he does so  This Sameness of Character and Parity of Circumstances with the Hero lessens his Importance and almost divides our Attention and Concern between them an Effect which  Shakespear  certainly did not intend to produce nor can it be lessened by the Consideration of the treacherous Measures  Laertes  was prevailed upon to enter into against  Hamlet  who had murdered his Father In this he does not differ much from  Hamlet  who did not attempt by open Force to revenge his Father's Murder  on his Uncle but designed to accomplish it by Subtilty and Craft  The same Equality is preserved in their Deaths and in their Actions throughout the Play  Laertes  wounds  Hamlet  with the poisoned Weapon in the Scuffle they change Rapiers and  Hamlet  wounds  Laertes  and they exchange Forgiveness with each other before they die  Thus has  Shakespear  undesignedly no doubt given us two Heroes instead of one in this Play the only Difference between them is that one of them is a Prince the other a Nobleman and but for this slight Distinction the Play might have been as well called the  Tragedy of Laertes  as  Hamlet  It ought to be observed that  Shakespear  has not been led into this Error by the History the Character of  Laertes  and all the Circumstances relating to him is his own which he has introduced by making the Spy who is killed Father of  Laertes  The Madness of  Hamlet  seems to be less essential to the Play than the History in the latter it affords him the Means of executing a Contrivance which absurd as it is secures the Accomplishment of his Revenge but in the Play it is of no other Use than to enliven the Dialogue unless its Usefulness may be deduced from its bringing on such Accidents as it was assumed to prevent for  Hamlet  's Madness  alarms the King's Suspicion and that produces the treacherous Embassy to  England  which failing the Contrivance of the poisoned Rapier followed and that does the Business  But since the King's conscious Guilt and Terror might reasonably have created a Distrust of  Hamlet  and that Distrust and a Desire of Security induced him to seek his Death what need had  Shakespear  to make his Heroe's Sense and Discretion appear doubtful by shewing him feigning a Madness destructive to his Safety and which he himself knows to be so and yet persists in  Shakespear  has indeed followed the History in making  Hamlet  feign himself mad but that Madness being of no Consequence to the principal Design of the Play as it is in the History or if of Consequence it hurts the Reputation of his Hero 'tis certainly a Fault for at least he only produces the same Events by a Blunder which might have happened without it  The Violation of poetical Justice is not the only Fault that arises from the Death of  Hamlet  the revenging his Father's Murder is the sole End of all his Designs and the great Business of the Play and the noble and fixed Resolution of  Hamlet  to accomplish it makes up the most shining Part of his Character yet this great End is delayed till after  Hamlet  is mortally wounded He stabs the King immediately upon the Information of his Treachery to himself thus his Revenge becomes interested and he seems to punish his Uncle rather for his own Death than the Murder of the King his Father  FINIS
