THEORY  of the  EARTH  _NO usual Flight of Verse  BURNET no softstrung Lyre  No slack Neaptide of Wit  Thy high Demands require  Thy PhysiologicKen  With Justice may refuse  The insufficient Homage  Of my DemiMuse  Thy curious Eye discerns  Seeds justling Seeds for Room  The Mudbuilt Shell and Seas  Within its spacious Womb  In gen'rous Search of Truth Thou feel'st  No meansoul'd Terror  Scornful of DoctoralDevice  Or VulgarError  But Hark the crumbling Crust  Illpropp'd cracks loud asunder  Mark next Earth's headlong Plunge  Amidst the Fluids under  Imprison'd Waves disturb'd  Start from their midland Bed  And with impetuous Rage  O'er their Oppressor spread  Huge Fragments shapeless Lumps  Immanely float around  Vast hideous Shatters  Of primigenial Ground  The now freewallowing Whale  With all the finny Race  Stare at the Sun astonish'd  By his golden Face  The silver Moon and Stars  Then gild the Watryway  And on its curling Surface  Tremulously play  How strong thy Words What must we  Thy LargeGenius call  No Copy can come Up  To thy Original  Whence was the first Discov'ry  Of thy Nostrum made  To bar again such Floodgates  When once Open laid  What Fears what Jealousies  Distract the thoughtful Head  Since taught by Thee our Feet  On faithless Ruins tread  But still this Rubbish rescu'd  From DiluvianFate  Kind Providence restores  To it's primeval State  Lo the GrandArchitect  In secondary Ire  With alter'd Scheme refines  A Globe relaps'd by Fire  From His consuming Torch  This just Vindictive brings  Inclusively one Fun'ralPile  To Men and Things  The lofty'st Alp at first  Griev'd for it's dripping Ice  Gutt'ring at last ItSelf  A molten Quarry lies  And Now pour ratlingdown  In furious Career  The sympathizing Rampiers  Of the Atmosphere  Thunder and Lightning Lambents  Hail Wind Rain and Snow  With all th' aspiring Train  Of Meteors from below  Into the common Blaze  Then will thy TOMES be hurl'd  Impossible to fail  Till jointly with the World  Here shifts the Scene Now cease  All sublunary Toils  On a relevel'd Orb  A sudden Verdure smiles  A constant Equinox maintains  Perpetual Spring  And virtuous Minds Ideas  Of Contentment sing  The Architect wellpleas'd  While Westwinds balm the Air  Desists and lastly says Behold  The Work is Fair  What now Immense Cosmographer  To Thee is due  Distanc'd I stop But if  My Prophecy be true  There Paradiseregain'd  Unknowing Care or Want  Shall like our Earth be proud  Of Thee it's Habitant  And may'st Thou there in  pure  Devotions join  With glorious GEORGE and beauteous CAROLINE
