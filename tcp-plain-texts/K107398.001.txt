 Mr  DENNIS  'S LETTERS FAMILIAR MORAL and CRITICAL  ORIGINAL LETTERS FAMILIAR MORAL and CRITICAL  By Mr  DENNIS  In TWO VOLUMES  VOLUME the FIRST  LONDON  Printed for W MEARS at the  Lamb  without  TempleBar  MDCCXXI  PREFACE  _I Here present the Reader with a Volume of Letters writ upon very different Occasions at very different Times They are far from being all of them equal but I hope their Variety will make amends for their Inequality I make no doubt but that upon perusal of the Critical part of them the old Accusation will be brought against me and there will be a fresh Outcry among Thoughtless People that I am an Illnatur'd Man 'Tis very odd that I should have that Character only from Persons who never knew me and who never were once in my Company But there are People in the World who imagine that Criticism must be the Effect of Ill nature These Persons know not what is meant by either of the Terms either  Criticism or Illnature otherwise they would be convinced that a good Criticism is the bestnatur'd thing in the World For by Goodness of Nature must be meant something that comes up to the true Nature of Man else it would be a Term of Reproach instead of Commendation But the true Nature of Man is a Reasonable and a Social Nature And a good Criticism is both Reasonable and Social It detects Error illustrates Truth advances Art and consequently has a direct Tendency to the Advancement of the national Honour If this last is true of good Criticism in general it must be most true of a just Criticism upon the Tragedy of  Cato  That Tragedy met with Success which never any other did It was acted for a Month together It has been translated into  French  and into  Italian  which never happen'd to any of our Dramatick Poems before And 'tis plain to all the Judges of Poetry that it has a Thousand shameful Faults and very  few natural Beauties What must the Knowers in  France  and  Italy  say upon reading these Translations Must they not Discourse after this Manner The  English  Nation boast much of their Poetry they extol to the Skies their  Shakespear  their  Ben Johnson  their  Milton  But yet they applaud nothing so loudly as this Tragedy of  Cato  They have got it translated both into  French  and  Italian  and have sent it to us as a MasterPiece to Insult us Else why has this Tragedy only been translated And yet this Tragedy at the same time that it has a Thousand Faults and most of them very gross ones has very few Beauties and those which it has are perhaps not of  British  Growth but are deriv'd from  Lucan  and  Seneca  What then must we think of those other Poets their  Shakespear  their  Ben Johnson  their  Milton  whom they formerly so much extol'd but not half so much as  Cato  Must we not conclude that these Islanders are  very indifferent Poets and more indifferent Judges  I appeal to the reasonable and impartial Reader if this must not be the Sense of all the knowing  French  and  Italians  who have seen these Translations Let the reasonable and impartial Reader judge then if a just Criticism upon  Cato  was not absolutely necessary both for the Advantage of Dramatick Poetry to which the undeserv'd Success of this Tragedy has done infinite Harm and for the Vindication of the National Honour let the Reader judge if it was not necessary that a Man who owns that he admires the noble Genius of  Shakespear  admires the unparallell'd Sublimity of the  Paradise Lost  of  Milton  that he is infinitely pleas'd with the MasterPieces of  Ben Johnson  and exceedingly delighted with several of our other Comick Poets should give his Reasons to all the World why he has no Esteem for  Cato  If what I have said is not sufficient to appease the Fury of a Headlong Cabal but they will still cry out that the Critical Letters in this Volume upon the Tragedy of  Cato  are the Effects of Illnature I must beg leave to exclaim in my turn that those Persons let them be who they will shew a deplorable want of publick Spirit who can prefer the Reputation of one Man and a Reputation which he does not deserve to possess before the Advantage of a noble Art and the Honour of their Country  But perhaps 'tis not the Author of  Cato  that these Persons are so much concern'd for 'tis themselves 'Tis themselves and their own Satisfaction which they prefer to the Prosperity of the Commonwealth of Learning and to the Good and Honour of their Country There are in the World very vain Persons who are resolv'd to maintain the good Opinion which they have of themselves at the Expence of every thing and utterly detest  the Man who shall dare to disturb them in the Possession of it by shewing them that they have pass'd a very foolish Judgment  If any are disgusted that these Observations are publish'd after the Death of the Author of that Tragedy I can assure them that they were writ in two long Letters to a Friend immediately after the REMARKS which were printed By what Artifice those two Letters were got out of my Hands by what Fortune I recovered the Substance of them and how it came to take the form which it now has I shall not here declare not the first thro' regard to the Memory of the Dead nor the two latter thro' Respect to the precious Time of the Living  Before I take my leave of this Subject I think my self oblig'd to do Justice to the Memory of Mr ADDISON who was certainly a Learned and very Ingenious Man And several of the  Tatlers  and  Spectators  which were writ by him deserv'd the Applause which they met with  I hope that what I have said will suffice to satisfy every reasonable Impartial Reader who is a true Lover of His Country For the rest I have long since learnt to esteem their Censures according to their just Value  TABLE  A

Acts of the Play I sent you so many Reasons which oblig'd me to differ from you with respect to the Encomium which you give to that Tragedy in your  Essay  upon  Epick Poetry  And whenever you think fit to lay your Commands upon me I shall lay before you the Reasons for which I dissent from you with regard to the Commendation which you give to a  late Translation  At present I shall pass to Things more general and consequently of far great Importance  IN the Chapter which treats of the Moral you are pleased to affirm two Things The first is That one who writes an Epick Poem need not in his first Intention pitch upon some considerable Moral and then contrive his Fable suitable to that Design The Second Thing is That there is no occasion that an Epick Poem should end Fortunately with regard to the Principal Character  BUT Sir before I give my Reasons for dissenting from you with regard to these Two Points the first of which is of Consequence and the Second of the utmost Importance I desire that you would give me leave to enumerate some Things in which we perfectly Agree that by this Method we may facilitate an Agreement in Things in which we Differ  We agree then Sir in the following Points  That there must be a Fable  Essay  p  That there must be an Action  Ess  p  That the Action must be one p  ibid  That there must be a Moral p  That the Fable and the Action must be only for the Moral  Ibid  p  That the Moral must be the genuine Result of the Fable and the Action p  That Admiration ought to be the predominant Passion in the narration of the Action p  Nothing that is common or ordinary can excite Admiration p  That there ought to be an Allegory p  THESE Sir are Things in which we agree expresly There are other Things in which we agree implicitly because if these last are false they destroy the Truth even of those in which we agree expresly as that  The Moral must contain an undeniable Truth or else it cannot be a Moral For Falshood may delude but only Truth can instruct  That the Instruction which the Poem gives must be general Moral Philosophy being the Law of Nature and consequently instructive to Mankind  That the Poetick Action must remain general even after the Imposition of Names for if the Action is particular there can be no general Instruction deduced from it the Conclusion being false to generals from particulars  That for the same Reason the Characters at the bottom must be general likewise even after the Imposition of Names  That the Action and Characters being both general even after the Imposition of Names they must be consequently both Allegorical  LET us come now Sir to the two foremention'd Particulars  YOU say That an Epick Poet is not oblig'd to have the Moral first in his Mind For say you no Author can form the Narration of any great and memorable Action but some Moral  will arise from it whether the Writer intends it or not Suppose this were true a Poet is to Instruct by his Art and not by Chance But the very contrary of this is true a Poet may form the Narration of a Hundred great and memorable Actions if these Actions are Particular and Historical and not one Moral shall arise from them all as the Battle of  Pharsalia  the Death of  Brutus  and  Cassius  the Death of  Cato  the Death of King  Lear  the Death of  Hamlet  the Death of  Harry  the Fourth And I defie any Poet to form a general Action and general Characters but he must form them upon a Moral and consequently that Moral must be first in his Head Can any one believe that  Aesop  first told a Story of a Cock and a Bull and afterwards made a Moral to it Or is it reasonable to believe that he made his Moral first and afterwards to prove it contriv'd his Fable Now I know no difference that there is between one of  Aesop  's Fables and the Fable of an Epick Poem as to their Natures tho' there be many and great ones as to their Circumstances 'Tis impossible for a Poet to form any Fable unless the Moral be first in his Head  YOU say that since  Homer  and  Virgil  does not expresly draw any Doctrine from their Fables it is not certain whether they design'd any and it is still more uncertain you say whether they intended those particular Morals which are generally ascrib'd to them which is as much as to say that tho' we can see a Design a good a just and a great Design in those admirable Poems  yet the Authors of them saw none and that perhaps that is not their Design which appears to us and others but something which after so many Ages has appeared to no Man Could  Homer  or  Virgil  if they had studied a Thousand Years have contrived Morals which would have been more the genuine result of all the Parts of their Fables and of their Actions than those which are generally ascribed to them Or can those Morals be made to appear the genuine result of any other Poetick Actions unless they are Copies of those  YOU continue to say That as from Pulpit Discourses on Divine Subjects many useful Inferences may be deduc'd by the Preacher so in these superior Poems  c  But here Sir you appear not to consider that the grand Moral of every Sermon is the Text which certainly is or ought to be first in the Mind of every Preacher  TO conclude my Remarks on this first Point it appears to me evident that every Man who undertakes any great Action has the chief Design which he proposes by it first of all in his Head but you yourself are pleased to own p  That the principal End of an Epick Poet is to give Pleasure and Instruction  and p  That the Pleasure is only in order to the Instruction  and p  That the most important part of the Instruction ought to arise from the whole Fable because the Instruction that arises from the whole must be more important than that which arises from the Parts  By owning all  which it is clear to me that you implicitly own That the Moral of an Epick Poem must be first in the Head of the Poet  I now Sir come to the Second Point concerning which we differ You are pleas'd to affirm That it is not necessary that an Epick Poem should end happily with relation to the Principal Character but that the Poets and mere Criticks have laid down this Rule without consulting Reason in the Case being led into it by the  Iliad  and  Odysses  of  Homer  and the  Aeneis  of  Virgil  And here you deplore that servile Submission which the Poets and Commentators have made to naked Anthority by which they have advanc'd Maxims out of Reverence to great Names without any Discussion of the Subject or entering upon any Enquiry which supports their Assertion because say you the End of the Epick Poet may be equally attain'd tho' the Event should be Unfortunate into which we are now to Enquire  THE principal Character of an Epick Poem must be either morally good or morally vicious if he is morally good the making him end unfortunately will destroy all Poetical Justice and consequently all Instruction Such a Poem can have no Moral and consequently no Fable no just and regular Poetical Action but must be a vain Fiction and an empty Amusement Oh but there is a Retribution in Futurity But I thought that the Reader of an Epick Poem was to owe his Instruction to the Poet and not to  himself Well then the Poet may tell him so at the latter end of his Poem Ay would to God I could see such a latter End of an Epick Poem where the Poet should tell the Reader that he has cut an honest Man's Throat only that he may have an Opportunity to send him to Heaven and that tho' this would be but an indifferent Plea upon an Indictment for Murder at the OldBaily yet that he hopes the goodnatur'd Reader will have Compassion on him as the Gods have on his Hero But Raillery apart Sir What occasion is there for having recourse to an Epick Poet to tell our selves by the bye and by occasional Reflection that there will be a Retribution in Futurity when the Christian has this in his Heart constantly and directly and the Atheist and Freethinker will make no such Reflection Tell me truly Sir would not such a Poet appear to you or me not to have sufficiently consider'd what a Poetical Moral is And should not you or I Sir be oblig'd in order to make him comprehend the Nature of it to lay before him that universal Moral which is the Foundation of all Morals both Epick and Dramatick and is inclusive of them all and that is That He who does good and perseveres in it shall always be Rewarded and he who does ill and perseveres in it shall always be punish'd Should we not desire him to observe That the foresaid Reward must always attend and crown good Actions not sometimes only for then it would follow that sometimes a perseverance in good Actions has no Reward which would take away all Poetical Instruction  and indeed every sort of Moral Instruction resolving Providence into Chance or Fate Should we not Sir farther put him in Mind that since whoever perseveres in good Actions is sure to be Rewarded at the last it follows that a Poet does not assert by his Moral that he is always sure to be Rewarded in this World because that would be false as you have very justly observ'd  p  and therefore never can be the Moral of an Epick Poem because what is false may Delude but only Truth can Instruct Should we not let him know Sir that this universal Moral only teaches us That whoever perseveres in good Actions shall be always sure to be Rewarded either here or hereafter and that the Truth of this Moral is prov'd by the Poet by making the principal Character of his Poem like all the rest of his Characters and like the Poetical Action at the bottom Universal and Allegorical even after distinguishing it by a particular Name by making this principal Character at the bottom a meer Poetical Phantom of a very short duration thro' the whole extent of which duration we can see at once which continues no longer than the reading of the Poem and that being over the Phantom is to us nothing so that unless our Sense is satisfy'd of the Reward that is given to this Poetical Phantome whose whole duration we see thro' from the very beginning to the end instead of a wholsome Moral there would be a pernicious Instruction  viz  That a Man may persevere in good Actions and not be Rewarded for it thro' the whole extent  of his duration that is neither in this World nor in the World to come  BUT tho' the principal Character of an Epick Poem is morally vicious yet the Poem ought not to end unfortunately with relation to that principal Character But here Sir I think my self oblig'd to explain my self By a Character morally vicious I by no means mean a Villainous Character Because a Villain can never have greatness of Mind nor greatness of Capacity sufficient to perform Things deserving to be admir'd But Admiration is as it were the Instrument by which the Poet works his End which is Instruction as has been acknowledg'd  BY a Character morally vicious then I mean such a Character as is compounded of good and bad Qualities the good at the same time overcoming the bad and Hiding them as the Sun does Mercury by the greatness of their Neighbouring Lustre Now a Poet is not to make an Heroick Poem end Unfortunately with relation to such a Character because such an end would weaken and destroy that Admiration which is requisite for the Poet's attaining his End and destroy or weaken it in the very place where its Influence is most requisite For as the greatest Impression that a Poem is to make ought to be made at the end of it the reigning Passion of that Poem ought to predominate most there As therefore Terrour and Compassion ought to be most violently mov'd at the Catastrophe of a Tragedy and Laughter at that of a Comedy Admiration ought to be rais'd to its utmost height  at the end of an Epick Poem But if that Poem should end unfortunately with relation to such a compounded Character as we have just mention'd above it would cause great Indignation in some and great Compassion in others Now as great Indignation and great Compassion are always attended with Grief Admiration is constantly accompanied with Joy An Epick Poet therefore by exciting Compassion or Indignation at the latter end of his Poem instead of Admiration would make that Poem throw off its Nature and assume that of Tragedy which is as directly contrary to its own as Grief is to Joy or as Light is to Darkness  NOR would such a prosperous End in relation to such a Character be in the least a violation of Poetick Justice tho' for the most part in Tragedy it would be a very great one because the Hero of an Epick Poem always carries on some good and great Design for the Advantage of that Society of which he is the chief or an illustrious Member at least it has been so in all the Epick Poems I have yet seen tho' this is far from being always the Case in Tragedy now that publick Virtue makes Compensation for all Faults but Crimes and he who has this publick Virtue is not capable of Crimes The ancient  Romans  and  Athenians  while Liberty flourish'd among them would have look'd very coldly upon a Poet who should have shewn a great Patriot unfortunate only for being a great Patriot In order to encourage publick Virtue and publick Spirit and the Love of their Countrey  they oblig'd their Epick Poets to shew those Virtues crown'd with Glory and Felicity Nay the Ancients made the very future Happiness of their Heroes depend upon the Success of their good and great Designs for the Welfare of their Country Witness that famous passage in the Fragment of  Cicero    De somnio Ciceronis Sed quo sis Africane alacrior ad Tutandam Rempublicam sic Habeto Oomnibus qui patriam conservaverint adjuverint auxerint certum esse in caelo ac Definitum locum ubi Beati aevo sempiterno fruantur  FOR my part I have no Notion that a suffering Hero can be proper for Epick Poetry  Milton  could make but very little even of a Suffering God who makes quite another Impression with his Lightning and his Thunder in  Paradise Lost  than with his Meckness and his Stoicism in  Paradise Regain'd  That great Spirit which Heroick Poetry requires flows from great Passions and from great Actions If the suffering Hero remains insensible the generality of Readers will not be much concern'd for one who is so little concern'd for himself The Greatness of his Mind may perhaps be admir'd by a few who are themselves magnanimous but the Author of an Epick Poem ought to write to Mankind and not only to the Age wherein he lives but to remotest Posterity If the Hero of an Epick Poem should not appear insensible in his Sufferings his Sensibility will be attended with Passions which are not only incompatible with that Admiration which ought to be mov'd thro  the Poem but which will sink its Spirit and debase its Majesty  LET us then Sir leave the Virtues of Patience and long Suffering to be taught by Priests They will not fail to inculcate such Doctrines frequently as being at once consistent with their Duty and their Craft But never fear that they will intrench upon your Province and recommend publick Virtue and publick Spirit and the Love of their Country to a People whom they have shewn too clearly that 'tis their Design to enslave But for your part Sir that you may deserve more and more of your Country and of Mankind make Choice of a Hero whose every Action may flow from those noble Principles and Reform a degenerate Age which seems so fond of Slavery Let his great Actions be crown'd with Glory and Victory with the Joyful Acclamations of the People whom he has made happy by his Heroick Conduct and Virtue and with such transcendent Felicity as may raise the highest Admiration in the Breast of every Reader inflame every one of them with the love of his Country and with a burning Zeal to imitate what he admires  October  TO Henry Cromwell  Esq  On the  Vis Comica  SIR  WHEN I had the favour of a Visit from you the other Day I was in a great deal of Pain and had been so for a Day and a Night before you saw me and continued so for the same space of Time after you left me and then I voided a Stone about the bigness of a Pea and so thanks be to God have been ever since at Ease  BUT what perhaps may surprize you is this That in the midst of all this Misery I read over four Comedies of  Terence    viz  The  Eunuch  the  Heautontimorumenos  the  Adelphi  and the  Phormio  These I read over in the two Evenings ofmy Illness in the  Cambridge  Quarto Edition a very convenient one for a Person of my gravity in a Winter's Evening tho' he who had the Care of the Edition understood nothing of the Stage In  the two Mornings of my Illness I read over Mrs  Dacier  's Comment upon the Four Comedies and upon the Life of  Terence  writ by  Suetonius  I have told you more than once that when the Commentators had sometimes led me into a Bog my own Common Sense had help'd to guide me out again You may guess what a deference I pay to the Herd of Commentators when you will see by what follows that I have the Assurance to contradict Monsieur  Le Fevre  and Mrs  Dacier  his Daughter for whose Learning Judgment and fine Discernment I have always had a singular Regard and Esteem  YOU know very well Sir that  Suetonius  in the latter end of his Life of  Terence  has mention'd some Verses of  Julius Caesar  in which that Emperor calls  Terence  a Demy  Menander  and complains that the  Vis Comica  was wanting to that Comick Poet  Tu quoque Tu in summis O dimidiate Menander  Poneris merito puri Sermonis Amatôr  Lenibus at{que} utinam scriptis adjuncta foret vis  Comica ut aequato virtus polleret Honore  Cum Graecis ne{que} in hac despectus parte jaceres  Unum hoc maceror Doleo tibi deesse Terenti  Mrs  Dacier  in her Remarks upon that part of the Life says That it was the Opinion of her Father Monsieur  Le Fevre  that by the  Vis Comica Caesar  meant the Passions from which Opinion the Daughter dissents for the two following  Reasons First Because the Passions are natural and essential to Tragedy and but incidental to Comedy Secondly Because it is impossible to preserve the Characters as  Terence  has admirably done without making them Speak upon occasion with as much Passion as that occasion requires which is not only justly but very finely observ'd And Indeed we find that the Passions in  Terence  upon great surprizes are extream lively and strong And when  Horace  tells us in his Art of Poetry that Comedy sometimes usurps upon Tragedy and has Passions which are next to Tragical He brings his Example from the  Heautontimorumenos  of  Terence  Interdum tamen vocem Comoedia tellit  Iratusque Chremes tumido Delitigat ore  But the Explication which Mrs  Dacier  her Self gives of the Words of  Caesar  is not a jot better than her Father's For by  Vis Comica  says she  Caesar  meant the Vivacity of the Action and the tying and solving the Knot of the Intrigue which is wrong for two Reasons First Because these both belong to Tragedy as nearly as they do to Comedy And Secondly Because if  Caesar  had understood by his  Vis Comica  what Mrs  Dacier  thinks he did he could never have call'd  Terence  a Demy  Menander  For  Terence  having the Business of two of  Menander's  Comedies in one of his and the  Grecian  Comedy being of as great a length as the  Roman    Terence  must consequently have more Intrigue and a  greater Vivacity of Action than  Menander  and consequently if  Caesar  by his  Vis Comica  had meant the Intrigue and the vivacity of Action He would have nominated  Terence  a Double instead of a Demy  Menander  But since I have Declared my self not at all satisfied with either the Father's or the Daughter's Explication you may perhaps expect that I should give my own I shall do it with Submission but upon this Condition that if I am in the wrong you and your Commentators shall set me right  I am apt to believe both from the Terms and the Reason of the Thing that by the  Vis Comica  must be meant something Comical and peculiar to Comedy For the chief Force of any kind of Poem must consist in that which makes the Characteristick of it and which distinguishes it from all other Poems As the chief Force of Tragedy must proceed from the moving Compassion and Terror strongly and the Chief Force of Epick Poetry from the exciting Admiration Powerfully so the chief Force of Comedy must consist in exciting Laughter By the  Vis Comica  then can never be meant the bare Vivacity of the Action and the tying and solving the Knot of the Intrigue which is common to both kinds of Dramatick Poetry as has been observ'd above but the lively Ridicule resulting from the Intrigue the Ridicule of the Incidents and especially of the Catastrophe which yet is but a part of the  Vis Comica  for there is likewise the Ridicule of the Characters proceeding from their several Humours and the Pleasantry  of the Sentiments and of the Dialogue When  Caesar  therefore says that  Terence  is but a Demy  Menander  what does he say but that  Terence  had turn'd four or five of  Menander  's Comedies into Latin and lost half the Ridicule and the Pleasantry of that  Athenian  Poet in Translating him That this was  Caesar  's Meaning is plain to me not only from the Reason and the Nature of the Thing which has been shewn above but from the great Delight which  Caesar  took in the  Ridiculum  and the great Encouragement which he gave to the  Mimes  of  Laberius  and  Publius Syrus  which were low Farces compos'd on purpose only to make People Laugh as likewise from the Method which  Terence  took in his Versions For taking two of  Menander  's Plays into one of his he must of Necessity leave a great part of his Dialogue behind him and by consequence a great part of his Pleasantry So that the same thing happen'd to  Menander  formerly which has befallen  Moliere  in our Days Several  English  Authors have translated Parts of him but not one of them has enter'd into that  naiueté  which is the purest Source of his Pleasantry as indeed it is of Pleasantry in general for what the  French  call  naiueté  which is a charming Simplicity dictated by pure Nature is almost always Original For there is something in it so easie so free so flowing and so natural as  ies the restraint of a Copy I do not pretend to say that there was none of the  naiueté  of  Menander  in  Terence  but I may venture to say after  Caesar  that there is not above half of it and consequently not above half his Pleasantry tho' at the same time I believe that there is more of this Quality in  Terence  than ever there was in a Copy and if the God of Laughter does not always attend upon  Terence Venus  and the  Graces  never leave him 'Tis my humble Opinion that there is no Dialogue extant in any Language which has half the Charms of the  Terentian  Dialogue what comes nearest to it is that of  Etherege  in Sir  Fopling Flutter  I who have been acquainted with  Terence  above forty Years am now more delighted with him than ever And sure that Beauty must be no common Charmer in whom Time shall discover new Graces and whom long possession renders more desireable  THUS have I given you my Sentiments If what I take to be the Sense of  Caesar  be not your own I desire you would set me right  I am  c  TO N ROWE  Esq  On his being made Surveyor at the CUSTOMHOUSE and His MARRIAGE  SIR  I Have been for several Weeks together endeavouring to wait on you But I have lately had an Intermitting Feaver and several Fits of the Stone which have brought me very low So that I can only congratulate you thus by Letter upon your New Post in the CustomHouse I was very much surpriz'd when I saw it in the Publick News For knowing it to be only a Warrant Place and consequently a Place which a Man cannot supply by Proxy I did not understand how it could be compatible either with your Pleasures or with your other Business However if you are pleas'd I am so likewise and once more I Congratulate you  BUT Sir I had almost forgot myself Instead of Congratulating you upon one Office I should wish you Joy of Two You are become a Husband since I saw you last as well as a Land Surveyor Jesu What Alteration must not those two Offices have made in the Life of a Gentleman who lov'd to lie in Bed all Day for his Ease and to sit up all Night for his Pleasure I must confess you are not so much a Novice in the former of these Employments as you are in the latter I think you were heretofore several Years in the former But is not the Business and Duty of a Husband such that a Man grows less and less Qualify'd to Discharge it the longer he has been in the Office An Office in which the Incumbent grows incapacitated by too much and too long an Experience  I am Sir Your  c  Whitehall  Saturday Octob  To His GRACE the Duke of ARGYLE  Written in the Name and at the Request of Mr PENKETHMAN the Comedian when he was a Prisoner in the King'sBench and Just Recovering from a great Fit of Sickness  MY LORD  SINCE I had the Honour to play the Fool before your Grace here it has been my Misfortune in the same Place to Act a very Melancholy Part for which your Grace knows very well that Nature has not adapted me and for which I can assure your Grace that I have not the least Inclination But the Part that I have been forc'd to act to the Life and almost to the Death has had so much Tragedy in it that the Spectators thought more than once that I would have gone quite off the Stage in an ill Humour  I have may it please your Grace pass'd the beginning of this Winter in  Southwark  as my old Patron and your Grace's old Friend  Phoebus  pass'd it in  Greenland  I have never Risen 'till Twelve and after I have been up little more than an Hour have been forc'd to go to Bed again have like him look'd very Pale and Wan all the Time I have been up and have been for the most part of that Time as I may say under a Cloud and it has been constantly expected when like my old Patron I should have gone under the Horizon for a long time before I rose again  BUT while I was thus between Life and Death and in sore Tribulation my old Patron came to me by Night at the Time when he disappeared to all the other Mortals of this Hemisphere and giving me a swinging lug by the Ear that has made one side of my Head Sore ever since  Pinky  quoth he be of good Cheer I have found a way to free thee from all thy Troubles I have put my Old and Va+lued Friend in Mind of thee who has promised me to talk with Collonel  Churchil  about Ways and Means to release Thee What Friend said I may it please thy Godship▪ With that he directly nam'd your Grace to me he did my Lord as I hope once more to be a merry Fool instead of a sour Melancholly Sage as I at this Instant am My Old and valued Friend quoth he has a Kindness for all my Domesticks who do their Business  so as to please him and me His Star and mine shall Shine in benign Conjuction thee I will heal thee His Grace and the Collonel will order a Contribution for thee and thou shall shortly act a ridiculous Squire in  Drury  instead of a sullen dying Sophister in the  Borough  But quoth I to my old Patron may I put his Grace in Mind of this and will not he take it ill Thou mayst put him in Mind of it answered he and I will pawn my Divinity on it that he will not take it ill  THUS my Lord depending on his Divinity and on your Grace's Humanity I have presum'd to send you this and if your Grace takes it otherwise than it was meant which was to bespeak your Favour and to Entertain you I will never for the future believe in  Phoebus  and will have no more dependance on him than has a small Poet who tires successively four Pair of Horses to engage Persons of Quality to come to his third Night  I am My Lord Your Grace's most humble and most dutiful Servant  W Penkethman  POSTSCRIPT  MY LORD  SINCE I had the Honour to Write what is above to your Grace  Phoebus  has appeared again to me and by another Lug made t'other side of my Head Sore  Pinky  quoth he thou knowest that we great Wits have often bad Memories I quite forgot to order thee to remind his Grace of the Method which he has resolv'd to use in working thy Deliverance His Grace is resolv'd in a numerous Assembly to put a Guinea into a Green Purse and throwing it down upon the Table to cry that is for  Pinky  's Deliverance That Action and those Words will have Magick in them for strait upon the Pronuncing them every Man's Guinea will of its own accord fly from his Pocket to the Table and will run rowling towards the Green Purse 'till it has join'd and Saluted his Grace's under which when they are united in a firm Confederacy they will march in a Body to the  King's Bench  to deliver  Pinky  from Bondage Thus will Guineas answer the End of their Creation which was to promote Liberty as  Louis d'ors  were Coin'd on Purpose to work Bondage The Scoundrel who Arrested  thee had two  Louis d'ors  for his Labour The Mischief that  Lewis  his Image did thee King  William's  shall undoc This be assur'd of and I command thee to send this with my Respects by Way of Postscript to his Grace  Borough Southwark  Nov  To His GRACE the Duke of  Marlborough  MY LORD  ON the th of  December  last I had the Honour to Receive a Letter from Your Grace Directed to Mr  Walpole  and inclos'd in one from Mr  Hodges  to me I return'd Your Grace that very Night my humble Acknowledgment for the extraordinary Favour you had done me and if I have not yet had the Honour to acquaint you with the Effect it had 'tis because I have been in Daily Expectations of the Event which is still Depending But notwithstanding this Delay my Lord I am not yet like a Man without Hope It seems to me impossible that the Duke of  Marlbrough  's Recommendation can ever come in Vain It would be hard that he who has turn'd the Fortune of  Europe  should nor be able to alter mine and that  Your Grace should receive that Repulse from one of your Friends which a hundred Thousand of your Enemies assembled in a Body have never been able to give you  I am MY LORD Your Grace's most humble and most obedient Servant J DENNIS  TO Captain STEELE  July  SIR  I Sent a Letter on the th to your House Directed to Captain  Steele  and desiring to see himthat Night that I might have his Advice upon a Business of Importance softly intimating at the same Time that it was not in my Power to wait upon him But having neither seen him nor heard from him I fancy that my old Friend is departed and some Gentleman has succeeded him in the old House with the same Name and the same Martial Title a Chance that happens oftener in the World than some People imagine How should I have been surpriz'd in Case I had gone my self expecting from the Similitude of Name and Title to have seen my old Acquaintance How should I have been surpriz'd to have found a Man with quite another Mind and quite another Countenance My old Friend as I thought at least had Civility had Humanity had a good and engaging  Officiousness and as I did not take him to want good Nature so he had what the  French  call a good Countenance that is the Countenance of one who is pleas'd with him who talks to him But I suppose I should have found nothing of all this in the noble Captain who succeeds him You will say perhaps that you had no Reason to make a Visit to one whom you know not and are resolved not to know But then Noble Captain you ought to have sent back my Letter and to have given me to understand that you are not the Person that I took you for that you should have enough to do if you were obliged to own all the Acquaintance of the Captain your Predecessor That I am not the first Man who have made this Mistake and shall not probably be the last Had you done this I had had no Replication to make to so equitable an Answer I should only perhaps have advis'd you in order to the preventing some troublesome Visits and some impertinent Letters to cause an Advertisement to be inserted in Squire  Bickerstaff  's next  Lucubrations  by which the World might be inform'd That the Captain  Steele  who lives now in  BuryStreet  is not the Captain of the same Name who liv'd there two Years ago and that the Acquaintance of the Military Person who inhabited there formerly may go look for their old Friend e'en where they can find him  I am Your  c  TO THO SERGEANT  Esq  Upon the Prospect from LEITHHILL in  Surrey  SIR  I Have ever since I saw you last been either in Motion or in Places where Ink is a Liquor more precious than  Tockay  But tho' I have ever since the Beginning of  July  been in the Country I have enjoy'd small Satisfaction if you except what the sight of the Country itself affords me which is indeed an Entertainment of which I can never be weary  I never in all my Life time left it without Regret and always return'd to it with Joy The Sight of a Mountain is to me more agreeable than that of the most pompous Edifice and Meadows and natural winding Streams please me before the most beautiful Gardens and the most costly Canals So much does Art appear to me to be surpass'd by Nature and the Works of Men by the Works of God But  here I desire you to believe that I speak of the Mechanick Works of Men For as to the Productions of Human Mind the more Art some of them have as particularly some sorts of Poetry the more lovely they are and more estimable because the more they have in them of true Art the more they have of Nature whereas in the Mechanick Works of Men the contrary of this is seen for the more consummate an Art appears in them the more they recede from plain and simple Nature  BUT thither to return from whence I digress'd as the Sight of the Country has been always more pleasing to me than that of the Town so in a late Journey which I took into the Wild of  Sussex  I pass'd over a Hill which shew'd me a more transporting Sight than ever the Country had shewn me before either in  England  or  Italy  The Prospects which in  Italy  pleas'd me most were that of the  Valdarno  from the  Apennins  that of  Rome  and the  Mediterranean  from the Mountain of  Viterbo  of  Rome  at Forty and of the  Mediterranean  at Fifty Miles distance from it and that of the  Campagne  of  Rome  from  Tiuoli  and  Frescati  from which two Places you see every Foot of that famous Campaigne even from the Bottom of  Tiuoli  and  Frescati  to the very Foot of the Mountain of  Viterbo  without any thing to intercept your Sight But from a Hill which I pass'd in my late Journey into  Sussex  I had a Prospect more extensive  than any of these and which surpass'd them at once in Rural Charms in Pomp and in Magnificence The Hill which I speak of is call'd  Leith Hill  and is about five Miles  Southward  from  Darking  about six from  BoxHill  and near twelve from  Epsom  It juts its self out about two Miles beyond that Range of Hills which terminates the  North Downs  to the  South  When I saw from one of those Hills at about two Miles distance that side of  Leith Hill  which faces the  Northern Downs  it appeared the beautifullest Prospect to me I had ever seen But after we had conquered the Hill it self I saw a Sight that would transport a Stoick a Sight that look'd like Enchantment and Vision but Vision Beatifick Beneath us lay open to our View all the Wilds of  Surrey  and  Sussex  and a great Part of that of  Kent  admirably Diversifyed in every Part of them with Woods and Fields of Corn and Pastures those Fields of Corn and Pastures being every where adorn'd with stately Rows of Trees  This beautiful Vale is about thirty Miles in Breadth and about sixty in Length and is terminated to the  South  by the Majestick Range of the  Southern  Hills and the Sea And 'tis no easie matter to decide whether these Hills which appear at thirty Forty Fifty Miles distance with their Tops in the Sky appear more Awful and Venerable or the Delicious Vale between you and them  more inviting About Noon in a serene Day you may at thirty Miles Distance see the very Water of the Sea thro' a Chasm of the Mountains And that which above all makes it a noble and a wonderful Prospect is that at the same time that at chirty Miles Distance you behold the very Water of the Sea at the same time that you behold to the  South  the most delicious Rural Prospect in the World at that very time by a little turn of your Head towards the  North  you look full over  Box Hill  and see the Country beyond it between that and  London  and over the very Stomacher of it see St  Paul  's at five and twenty Miles Distance and  London  beneath it and  Highgate  and  Hampstead  beyond it It may perhaps appear incredible to some that a Place which affords so great and so surprising a Prospect should have remain'd so long in Obscurity in so great Obscurity that 'tis unknown to the very Frequenters of  Epsom  and  Box Hill  But alas we live in a Country more fertile of Great Things than of Men to admire them Who ever talked of  Cooper  's  Hill  till Sir  John Denham  made it Illustrious How long did  Milton  remain in Obscurity while twenty paltry Authors little and vile if compared to him were talk'd of and admir'd But here in  England  nineteen in twenty like by other Peoples Opinions and not by their  own That Fools by their Approbation should draw in Fools as Sheep leap after Sheep is no great matter of Wonder But that Fools by their Numbers should prove so powerful as to influence Men of Sense and engage them to approve of what they would otherwise utterly have contemned is what I have often wonder'd at but never could yet account for but such unnatural monstrous Things as these make the Town more odious and the Country more agreeable  I am  c  Hampstead  Aug  Oct    TO S  T  Esq  On the Deceitfulness of RUMOUR  SIR  IT was always my Opinion that Judgment is a cool and a slow Faculty and no more constantly attends a Man in the warmth of Wine and of Conversation than in the Fury and Rapture of a Poetical Composition If I had in the least doubted of this what past at your House on the first of this Month would have perfectly convinced me of it where for want of Coolness to consider Things I betray'd my own Cause and that of my departed Friend Mr  Wycherly  I shall say but a Word or two of my own but I desire to be a little longer about his  I then declared it to be my Opinion that  Freethinking  would at one time or other  endanger our Constitution That it invalidates the very Things which are the greatest Security both of Princes and People and those are the Oaths which the Subjects of  Great Britain  take either as Subjects or Witnesses To which a Gentleman in the Company answer'd that the Oaths derived their binding Force from the very Law of Nature as well as from the Christian Religion with which Answer for want of Coolness and Time to consider I remain'd at that instant satisfied  But as soon as I bad Coolness and Time to consider I found that a double Reply might justly be made to that Answer of your Friend For in the first Place the  Freethinkers  are divided into  Atheists  and  Deists  Now the former of these cannot be at all influenced by the Law of Nature For to them to whom there is no God there can be no Law of Nature And as for the latter tho'  Theists  are influenced by the Law of Nature yet we ought to consider that the Oath which an  Englishman  is oblig'd to take as a Subject or a Witness derives its most binding Force and its most sacred Solemnity from that which distinguishes it from all other Oaths and that is the laying Hands upon the Bible and kissing it which Ceremonies are certainly not deduceable from the Law of Nature but are wholly derived from that Revelation  which the  Theists  do not believe  Freethinking  then is the Cause why both  Atheists  and  Theists  by contemning those Ceremonies and disbelieving the Revelation from whence they are derived are come slightly to regard the very Oath it self Yes  Freethinking  is the Cause that at this time of day we have so many brave KnightsErrant of the Post both Spiritual and Secular  That eat perfidiously their Words  And swear their Ears thro' twoinch Boards  Can own the same thing and disown  And perjure booty  pro  and  con    Can make the Gospel serve their turn  And help them out to be forsworn  When 'tis laid Hands upon and kiss'd  To be betray'd and sold like Christ  Thus have I spoke to my own Cause in as few Words as I could I desire to dwell a little longer upon my late Friend Mr  Wycherly  's A Gentleman in the Company was pleased to say that the Comedy of the  Country Wife  had not a just Foundation because said he it was not practicable for  Horner  to make himself pass for an Eunuch How not practicable when he himself was at the bottom of the Design and had taken so many Precautions to make  it succeed I am so far from being of your Friend's Opinion that I would lay fifty to one if I were but capable of suborning half a dozen Rascals who should warmly and industriously spread the Report that I would make either you or your Friend pass for  Freethinkers  with a considerable part of the Town in spight of your utmost Attempts to undeceive them How can that be you'll say when there would be neither Truth nor Probability in such a Report But have Truth or Probability any thing to do with the Entertainments of publick Rumour When my Lord  Rochester  said  There's not a Thing on Earth that I can name  So Foolish and so False as Common Fame  did he banter do you think or speak it from a thorough Knowledge of the World and of Mankind There is another of our Poets who knew Mankind perfectly well who will tell you the same thing in Terms that are something stronger  The World is naturally averse  To all the Truth it sees or hears  But swallows Nonsense and a Lie  With Greediness and Gluttony  Butler Part Cant  'Tis true indeed if the Rabble and Scum of Mankind of whose Voices publick Rumour is compos'd had but so much true Sense as a sober Beast why then the Rule that  Horace  has laid down for the Tragick Stage might do pretty well for the Stage of the World  Segnius irritant animos demissa per aures  Quam quae sint oculis subjecta Fidelibus quae  Ipse sibi tradit Spectator  But since the case is far otherwise and so many Ideots will believe that they See what they only Hear where as no Dog no Horse nay no Ass is Fool enough to let his external Sense be impos'd upon by his beastly Imagination  Butler  has been so far from thinking that  Horace  's Rule for the Tragick Stage is proper for the Stage of the World that he has laid down for the Latter one which is the very Reverse of the other  For like the World Mens Jobbernoles  Turn round upon their Ears the Poles  And what they're confidently told  By no Sense else can be controul'd  What my Lord  Rochester  and the Author of  Hudibras  have declar'd in their Verses  our Dramatick Poets have endeavour'd to shew upon the Stage  viz  That the Eyes of the Rabble of Mankind are downright Cullies to their Ears and that they easily believe that they actually See what they are only impudently Told of Witness what passes between  Vindicius  and old  Brutus  in the  Junius Brutus  of  Lee  and between  Hamlet  and  Polonius  in the  Hamlet  of  Shakespear  which seems to be the original of the other And has not  Ben  Learned  Ben  who is so great a Master of his Art and consequently of Human life and nature shewn us the very reverse of this in the Catastrophe of his admirable Alchimist  viz  shewn us Persons who what before they had actually seen are made to believe that they only vainly imagin'd and for no other Reason but because they are impudently told that they only vainly imagin'd it  I tell you then again and again that I would undertake if I could but be brought to use the Means to make both you and your Friend pass for Eunuchs in spight of the Testimony of Twenty Females who might cry out in Mrs  Pinchwife  's Language they won't see poor Mr  Horner  abus'd for to their certain knowledgeFor tho' that perhaps might undeceive a few the general Opinion would still remain For why may it not be as practicable to geld you and your Friend as it has been to burst one of your old  Acquaintance in spight not only of Truth but of all manner of Probability in spight of his own solemn Asseverations to the contrary of the continual vigorous Exercises both of Riding and Walking which he has us'd of late and lastly in spight of ocular and manual Proof to the contrary given to eminent Chirurgeons and others when neither Truth nor reasonable and strong Presumption nor Evidence of Sense that has been given to several have been able to undeceive the many but the Rupture has still remained in the empty Heads of a thousand Fools who have still endeavour'd to propagate the senseless Error  For Fools are stubborn in their way  As Coins are hardned by th' Allay  And Obstinacy's ne'er so stiff  As when 'tis in a wrong Belief  Hudib  If any thing that I have said about this last Affair may happen to surprise you the Surprise I suppose will still be greater when you are told that the two Apostles of this new Doctrine like those of  Mahomet  are downright Ass and Widgeon  The gross of Mankind have infinitely more Propensity to censure than to praise They generally praise thro' Interest and they censure by Inclination And yet the Poison of false Praise has more than once  grown epidemically contagious by the Error and Imbecility of a few and the Conspiracy of a false Report You cannot have forgot what happened to that ugly Beau  Bovey  in the Time of King  Charles  the Second  Bovey  's a Beauty if some few agree  To call him so the rest to that degree  Affected are that with their Ears they see  You may remember that something like this has happen'd upon the Representation of several of our Dramatick Performances when blundering sustain Tragedies or trifling insipid Comedies have by the Conspiracy of a Cabal and their concerted Applauses been cogg'd upon the Town for Masterpieces to the Dishonour of our Country and Disgrace of the  British  Poetry Some Persons who have been in these Conspiracies knew or ought to have known better Things But one unaccountable Effect of Vanity among many others is that some Persons tho' they do not want Understanding yet at the Expence of the Reputation of their CommonSense are fond of shewing their Power are fond of shewing their Power to Fools at the Expence of the Reputation of their CommonSense with the thinking part of the World  How often has something like this happened among our Statesmen How often have they topp'd White for Black and Black for White upon the thoughtless Rabble How often have they who Yesterday were thought Heroes and Patriots and Demygods to Day been look'd upon as Villains and Thieves and Robbers and they who Yesterday were held Villains and Traitors have to Day been regarded as Heroes and Saints and Patriots Have not our Politicians more than once turn'd the Rehearsal out of Ridicule by turning the whole State topsy turvy in a Morning only by the Artillery of false Reports without so much as striking a real Blow and by that means proving to all the World that one might take Mr  Bays  for a Politician that Mr  Bays  's Politicks were good and sound and that his  quondum  Grace of  Bucks  was out when he pretended to make a Jest of them  But in short and Raillery apart the Prevalency of false Reports concerted by five or six dark Sophisters has more than once made some of the best and greatest Men in the Kingdom who but just before were approv'd applauded admir'd and cherish'd by all the Lovers of their Country become all at once the very Hatred and Scorn of the Rabble which I believe neither ever did or could have happen'd any  where but in  England  either as to the Excess of Malice in the Inventors or the Excess of Credulity in the Believers and Propagators of those false Reports For that which makes  England  the most splenetick Country in the Universe makes it the chief and residentiary Seat of Slander For there never was a very splenetick Man unless he was a Man of an extraordinary Understanding but he was at the same time a Slanderer And the same virulent Humour that causes so many noble  Britons  to hang and poison and drown themselves causes them likewise to do their utmost to murder the Reputation of their Neighbours and the same Humour that in some degree caus'd the Invention of the Slander at first causes likewise the Propagation of it and the Credulity of its Believers Judge then if in such a Country as this even an improbable false Report be not a just Foundation for a Comedy But the Report of  Horner  's Impotency since he himself invented it and prepared the Way for it is so highly probable that a Man must be very Hypercritical who upon that account censures my late most ingenious Friend I have a great deal more to say upon this Subject but I want Time at present  I am  c  To the Reverend Mr MANSELL Rector of COSGRAVE  SIR  YOURS of the d of the last Month came to my Hands in due time I had sooner returned you Thanks for the favour of it and had sooner congratulated you upon the return of your Health upon which so many Healths depend and which under God has been so often the cause of the Recovery of mine if I had not been engag'd in an Important Business which took up all my Hours I likewise return you my hearty thanks for setting the Affair between me and my BrotherinLaw in a true light tho' I perceive by what you write that there are Persons who continue to believe him But I would fain ask those Persons what Motive they have to restrain them from doing an unjust or a base thing which I have not in a much greater Degree They will  say perhaps that they have got a great deal more Money than I have But Sir is not their getting a great deal a sign of their great Love for it And if I have all my life time had but a little do they believe it has proceeded from my Incapacity of getting it or from my Contempt of it And which is most like to secure any one from doing Injustice the Love of Money or the Contempt of it Have their Purses been more constantly open to the Occasions of their Friends and Acquaintance Have they discover'd more magnanimous Thoughts and more exalted above Selfishness Have they more Understanding to discern their true Interest and to know that no Man can live happily without living reputably Have they had a more liberal Education or a more generous Conversation I was till five and forty plung'd in the Conversation of the great World and was every Day in company with Gentlemen who are universally known to be Men of no ordinary Merit who wanted no Discernment to know me and who have several of them given publick proofs of their Esteem for me Now if I mistake not before the Age of forty five the Manners of Men are unalterably form'd For these last fifteen Years I have retir'd from the World and confin'd my Conversation to three or four of my old Acquaintance who are publickly known to be Men  of Men of Honour and Understanding Can any reasonable Man then believe that I who while I was conversant in the World kept my Reputation clear should retire to be a Villain in Solitude If I refus'd to answer a Demand which my BrotherinLaw pretended he had upon me 'tis because he had no title to any thing from me but his want of it If he had ask'd me to give him the Money which he said I ow'd him I had certainly given it him But I could not think without Indignation that an ungrateful Wretch to whom I had endeavour'd at the expence of my Time and Interest to do the most Important Services should pretend to extort it from me by Insults and Brutality What those Services are I shall let you know in my next but I am weary at present and so without doubt are you  I am SIR Your most Humble Faithful Servant JOHN DENNIS  Aug  June  TO Mr * * *  In which are some Passages of the LIFE of Mr JOHN CROWN Author of Sir  Courtly Nice  SIR  I Shall now in compliance with the repeated Requests you have made to me say something concerning the Education of Mr JOHN CROWN and the most remarkable Passages of his Life Mr CROWN was bred under his Father an Independant Minister in that part of  Northern America  which is called  Nova Scotia  But the Vivacity of his Genius made him soon grow impatient of that sullen and gloomy Education and soon oblig'd him to get loose from it and seek his Fortune in  England  But it was his Fate at his first Arrival here to happen on an Employment more formal if possible than his  American  Education His Necessity upon his first Arrival here oblig'd him to become a GentlemanUsher to an old Independant Lady But he soon grew as weary of that precise Office as he had been before of the Discipline of  Nova Scotia  One would think that these were but indifferent Preparatives to the commencing polite Author But neither these nor his Poverty which was great could oppress his aspiring Spirit aspiring to Reputation and Distinction rather than to Fortune and Power His Writings soon made him known to the Court and Town Yet it was neither to the Favour of the Court nor of  Wilmot  Lord  Rochester  one of the shining Ornaments of it that he was indebted for the Nomination which the King made of him for the writing the Mask of  Calypso  but to the Malice of that noble Lord who design'd by that Preference to mortify Mr  Dryden  Upon the breaking out of the two Parties after the Discovery of the Popish Plot the Favour that he was in at Court the Gayety of his Youth and his being unacquainted with true political Principles engaged him to embrace the Party of the Tories About that time he writ  The City Politicks  on purpose to Satyrize and expose the Whigs a Comedy so agreeable that it deserv'd to be writ in a much better Cause But after he had writ  it he met with very great Difficulties in the getting it acted  Bennet  Lord  Arlington  who was then Lord Chamberlain of the King's Houshold and who had secretly espous'd the Whigs who were at that time powerful in Parliament in order to support himself against the Favour and Power of the Lord Treasurer  Danby  who was his declared Enemy us'd all his Authority to suppress it One while it was prohibited on the account of its being Dangerous another while it was laid aside on the pretence of its being Flat and Insipid till Mr  Crown  at last was forc'd to have Recourse to the King himself and to engage him to give his absolute Command to the Lord Chamberlain for the acting of it which Command the King was pleas'd to give in his own Person For that Monarch lov'd a Comedy above all Things excepting one Thing and had no mean Opinion of Mr  Crown  's Qualifications to succeed in it While he was thus in Favour with the King and the Court I have more than once heard him say that tho' he had a sincere Affection for the King he had yet a mortal Aversion to the Court The Promise of a Sum of Money made him sometimes appear there to solicit the Payment of it But as soon as he had got it he vanish'd and continued a long time absent from it of which he told me the  Dutchess of  Portsmouth  took once Occasion to complain to the King whose way of answering that Complaint puts me in mind of a Passage in  Boileau  's Epistle to  Lamoignon  Hier de vous on parla chez le Roy  Et d' attentat Horrible on traita la Satire  Et le Roy que dit il Le Roy se prit a rire  It was at the very latter End of King  Charles  's Reign that Mr  Crown  being tyr'd with the Fatigue of Writing and shock'd by the Uncertainty of Theatrical Success and desirous to shelter himself from the Resentments of those numerous Enemies which he had made by his  City Politicks  made his Application immediately to the King himself and desir'd his Majesty to establish him in some Office that might be a Security to him for Life The King had the Goodness to assure him he should have an Office but added that he would first see another Comedy Mr  Crown  endeavouring to excuse himself by telling the King that he plotted slowly and awkwardly the King replyed that he would help him to a Plot and so put into his Hands the  Spanish  Comedy called  Non pued Esser  Mr  Crown  was oblig'd immediately to go to work upon it but after he had writ three Acts of it found to his Surprise that the  Spanish  Play had some time before been translated and acted and damn'd under the Title of  Tarugo  's  Wiles or the Coffeehouse  Yet supported by the King's Command he went boldly on and finish'd it and here see the Influence of a Royal Encouragement  Mr  Crown  who had once before oblig'd the Commonwealth of Learning with a very agreeable Comedy in his  City Politicks  yet in Sir  Courtly Nice  went far beyond it and infinitely surpassed himself For tho' there is something in the part of  Crack  which borders upon Farce the  Spanish  Author alone must answer for that For Mr  Crown  could not omit the Part of  Crack  that is of  Tarugo  and the  Spanish  Farce depending upon it without a downright Affront to the King who had given him that Play for his Groundwork But all that is of  English  Growth in Sir  Courtly Nice  is admirable for tho' we find in it neither the fine Designing of  Ben Johnson  nor the general and masculine Satyr of  Wycherly  nor that Grace that Delicacy nor that Courtly Air which make the Charms of  Etherege  yet is the Dialogue so lively and so spirited and so attractively diversified and adapted to the several Characters four of those Characters are so entirely new yet so general and so important are drawn so truly and so graphically and oppos'd to  each other  Surly  to Sir  Courtly  and  Hothead  to  Testimony  with such a strong and entire Opposition those Extremes of Behaviour the one of which is the Grievance and the other the Plague of Society and Conversation excessive Ceremony on one side and on the other side Rudeness and Brutality are so finely expos'd in  Surly  and Sir  Courtly  and those Divisions and Animosities in the two great Parties of  England  which have so long disturb'd the publick Quiet and undermined the publick Interest are so happily represented and ridicul'd in  Testimony  and  Hothead  that tho' I have more than twenty times read over this charming Comedy yet I have always read it not only with Delight but Rapture And 'tis my Opinion that the greatest Comick Poet that ever liv'd in any Age might have been proud to have been the Author of it  The Play was now just ready to appear to the World and as every one that had seen it rehears'd was highly pleas'd with it every one who had heard of it was big with the Expectation of it and Mr  Crown  was delighted with the flattering Hope of being made happy for the rest of his Life by the Performance of the King's Promise when upon the very last Day of the Rehearsal he met  Cave Underhill  coming from the PlayHouse as he himself was going  towards it Upon which the Poet reprimanding the Player for neglecting so considerable a Part as he had in the Comedy and neglecting it on a Day of so much Consequence as the very last Day of Rehearsal Oh Lord Sir says  Underhill  we are all undone Wherefore says Mr  Crown  is the PlayHouse on Fire The whole Nation replys the Player will quickly be so for the King is dead At the hearing which dismal Words the Author was little better for he who but the Moment before was ravish'd with the Thought of the Pleasure which he was about to give to his King and of the Favours which he was afterwards to receive from him this Moment found to his unspeakable Sorrow that his Royal Patron was gone for ever and with him all his Hopes The King indeed reviv'd from his Apoplectick Fit but three Days after dyed and Mr  Crown  by his Death was replung'd in the deepest Melancholy  Thus Sir have I given you a short Account of the Education of Mr  John Crown  and of the most remarkable Circumstances of his Life to the Death of King  Charles  the Second I shall as soon as I have Opportunity continue this Relation from the Death of King  Charles  to the Death of Mr  Crown  I am SIR Your  c  To his Grace the Duke of BUCKINGHAM  My LORD  NOT being able to wait on your Grace by reason of an intolerable Headach I humbly desire that you would order the Letter which you have done me the Honour to write for me to be delivered to the Bearer  I humbly desire your Grace to believe that if you had given me no Caution I had by no means done any thing which might cause me to forfeit your good Opinion of me So far were my Thoughts from that that I never yet resolv'd to publish those Remarks 'Tis very likely that after your Grace and my Lord  Hallifax  and Two or Three more have perus'd them I may send them to the Author and content my self with letting him know my Power  BUT my Lord as I would not be thought to do a Barbarous thing I desire your Grace to believe that I had powerful  Motives to engage me to write these Remarks I was attack'd in the  in the very second or third and in several others Since your Grace is of opinion that the Author of the Tragedy did not write those particular Papers I am very willing to believe it But he was in Partnership with those who did He went share in the Profits and more than share in the Reputation And Mr  durst not have provok'd me without his Approbation or at least his Consent My Lord with submission to your Grace's Judgment I am apt to believe that what Mr  did in this Case was the Action of Mr  ▪ If a Man who is in Partnership wrongs me in Trade all the Partners are involv'd in the Guilt unless they disclaim it and signify their Abhorrence of it to the Person injur'd The Law of  England  allows of no Accessaries in Murder all who are concern'd in it are Principals And Reason upon which the Law of  England  is founded says that the Case is the same in the assassinating a Man's Reputation My Lord I appeal to your Grace if the attacking me in the  was not only an Assassination but one of the blackest sort It was done in the dark no Provocation in the least given no Name to the Paper and no Author known when at the very same Time they openly profest Friendship to me  I may add to this that it was done at a time when they basely took advantage of the great Misfortunes I lay under My Lord I appeal to your Grace if mine is not a more generous Proceeding I do not attack but retort I proceed frankly and openly and I who am in Adversity engage one who is in high Prosperity  Yet after all my Lord the Satyr of this Criticism for Reason is the severest Satyr in the World when it is terribly against a Man does not fall most heavily upon the Author of the Tragedy it falls most severely upon this partial and tastless Town The writing a foolish Play is a Piece of Ridicule that we have long been us'd to But the gaining a general violent Applause to a foolish Play is something new to us 'tis the reviving a Farce that had been acted but once before since King  Charles  the Second's Time  My Lord I am afraid of tiring your Grace's Patience by too long a Letter or I would proceed to the other Motives which prevailed upon me to write these Remarks But I hope to have the Honour of acquainting you with them another time  I am My Lord Your Grace's  c  Whitehall  June  TO Mrs * * *  Written upon the News of the Landing of the Pretender  Madam  I Have lately read over the famous Process between the Marquis  De Gueores  and Madamoiselle  de Mascranny  with which I have been agreeably entertain'd and which I here send you by the Bearer because a Lady of your Apprehension may easily discern that you may produce an Argument from it sufficient to convert your Friend Mrs  that termagant Stickler for divine unalienable indefeasible Right for can there be any Right to any Government so divine so unalienable so indefeasible as that of a Husband to the Government of his Wife Yet if this Monarch  by Right Divine appears unqualify'd to govern her well if he cannot answer the Ends of Government if he keeps not the original Contract which is on his part the giving due Benevolence she endeavours to depose her Sovereign immediately that is she sues out a Bill of Divorce and chuses another King The original Contract between a limited Monarch and a free People is that he shall govern them by Laws of their own making and that they shall obey him as long as they are so govern'd Now will your Friend Mrs  murmur at our Sexes enjoying that Privilege which you have always claim'd your selves We have already depos'd one Popish King for breaking this originnl Contract and can she expect that we will set up another who we know is not able to keep it Would she accept of one for a Husband whom she knew beforehand to be in a State of Impotence How then can she pretend that we should accept of such a Governour Is not a Popish Pretender as much unqualify'd to govern a freeborn Protestant People as one in a natural State of Impotence is to give due Benevolence Are not both Pretenders equally impotent as to what they pretend to Then pray Madam acquaint your Friend Mrs  that since our Sex is assistant to yours in throwing off your evil Governours when  you find upon Heartbreaking Disappointments that you cannot be happy under them 'tis altogether unreasonable in her to pretend that we ought to establish any one Ruler over us who is utterly incapable of rendring his Subjects happy Desire her to lay aside her Notions of Divine Right and Arbitrary Power She wrongs her self and her whole Sex by these fantastical Opinions No Power on Earth but that of Beauty can justly pretend to Right Divine for Beauty has its Power from Nature and consequently from God  I am Madam Yours  c  London  Jan  TO JUDAS ISCARIOT  Esq  On the present State of the Stage  SIR  I Have been about to write to you every Post for these ten Days but one Accident or other has still diverted me but I shall now make more than amends for  Ingentem tibi Epistolam Impingam  If I had had the greatest Inclination imaginable to accept of the Invitation which you sent me by your Familiar yet something has happen'd which would have been a Just tho' a Ridiculous Impediment For I had given my word to go another way in order to pull a certain Beast out of a Ditch who had fal'n into it thro' a more than Bestial Stupidity which engag'd him to look upon things above him instead of grazing and following the Instinct of Nature But  to speak plain  English  and return to your Invitation who could have expected any such thing from one who had so barbarously abandon'd his old Acquaintance who had never so much as once in Twenty Years miss'd an opportunity of serving him and abandon'd him contrary both to Friendship and Politicks For a Man who deserts his Friend in an Affair in which 'tis reasonable that he should espouse him does two Things at once to his own Disadvantage For first he shews the World that he has no Body's Interest at heart but his own which Indifference the World as soon as it perceives it will be sure to return in Kind Secondly he gives a pretty convincing Proof that he has not Capacity enough to understand his own Interest for he who in any Point that is reasonable is deaf to his Friend's Interest is certainly blind to his own Now what Dependance can I have on a Person who makes it evident to me that he neither cares for my Interest nor understands his own If you had laid aside the Alteration of  Coriolanus  for better Plays there had been a plausible Apology for your Breach of Promise But to sacrifice me to Fools was Impudent as 'twas Barbarous I have read the noble Stuff which you have acted this Winter all but  Busiris  which was not publish'd when I left the Town But some  Persons whom I have seen in this place tell me there is a Rape in it If that is true it has a Fault in it for which nothing can make Atonement A Rape is the peculiar Barbarity of our  English  Stage Neither  Greecians  nor  Romans  would suffer it nor can the  French  at present bear it The very Apprehension of a Rape tho' the thing did not follow it damn'd the  Theodore  of  Corneille  which if you will believe Monsieur  Hedelin  is one of his best Tragedies I would fain know from you who have had a twenty Years Experience of the Stage for what Reason the Women who will sit as quietly and passively at the Relation of a Rape in a Tragedy as if they thought that Ravishing gave them a Pleasure for which they have a just Apology will start and flinch like unback'd Fillies at the least Approach of  Rem  to  Re  in Comedy unless that Approach happens to be made in the House of Bondage I have been sometimes apt to entertain a Suspicion that 'tis not the luscious Matter which disturbs them in Comedy but the secret implicite Satire upon the Sex For a Woman in Comedy never grants the last Favour to one to whom she is not marry'd but it proclains the Man's Triumph and her Shame It always shews her Weakness and often her Inconstancy and sometimes her Fraud and Perfidiousness But a Rape in  Tragedy is a Panegyrick upon the Sex For there the Woman has all the Advantage of the Man For she is suppos'd to remain innocent and to be pleas'd without her Consent while the Man who is accounted a damn'd Villain proclaims the Power of Female Charms which have the Force to drive him to so horrid a Violence But to return to the other Plays which you acted this last Winter I have read two Comedies without one Jest in them But you will say perhaps that the PlayHouse was throng'd for eight or ten Days together at the Representation of these Comedies perhaps so But then if it was so throng'd at the Representation of damn'd Plays I hope my Ears will no more be stunn'd with the Noise of the Improvement of a general Taste and that for the future no Consequence will be drawn from the Numbers of an Audience to their Capacity For the very same Reason that the Builder's Trade the Carpenters and the Joyners are so very much improv'd for the very same Reason that so many fine Houses so many beautiful Streets so many stately Squares and as it were whole Towns are building in your NorthWest Suburbs for that very same Reason is your Theatre crowded A Penetration that comes far short of Conjuration may suffice to shew that the Numbers of the Nobility and Gentry of the  Town and consequently of their Dependants are exceedingly augmented by some great Events which have happen'd of late Years  viz  the Revolution the Union with  Scotland  the Return of our Armies from the Continent and the King's Accession to the Crown But as for the Improvement of a general Taste 'tis so great a Blunder that it could never be thought of among considerate People 'Tis improv'd indeed with a vengeance 'tis refin'd in a glorious manner improv'd as the Taste of a Greensickness Girl who leaves palatable Meat for Charcoal refin'd as the Taste of an Hysterick Woman who is cherish'd by a Stink and sickens at a Perfume or as the Taste of a modern Letcher who like a Swine prefers a Sirreverence to the finest thing in the World The ingenious Diversions which they follow'd this Winter their Masquerades their  Italian  Farces and their  French  Tumblings cannot chuse but shew the great Refinement of their Taste If the general Taste were improv'd two things would certainly follow good Plays would be writ and damn'd ones would not be endured But  Shakespear  's Plays you will say were crowded and  Tom D'Urfey  's neglected this Winter Be it so I shall shew you in my next that the Generality of  an Audience in spight of their Practice have it both in their Heads and their Hearts to value  Tom D'Urfey  and to despise  Shakespear  I am Your  c  HamptonCourt  April  LETTER written in behalf of one who was lately ruin'd by  StockJobbing  to his FatherinLaw who would not see him  SIR  THIS is the third Letter which I have writ to you without the Satisfaction of receiving an Answer which has been a great Accession to the Calamity which I labour'd under before and I have felt the Frowns of Fortune the more severely because they have been attended with yours 'Tis hard that it shou'd be in her Power to alienate not only our Possessions but even the Hearts and Souls of our dearest and most valued Friends As we learn from her hourly Inconstancy that there is no Man secure from her Power methinks it should be the common Interest of Mankind to alleviate her Strokes by using their FellowCreatures gently while they are under her Disgrace especially since long Experience has taught us that she is often the  most barbarous to those who deserve her Cruelty the least so that her Persecution being for the most part directly contrary to Reason should least of all be abetted by reasonable Men like you My Intentions have been very good tho' the Event has not been answerable to them and methinks when we pass a Judgment upon our Neighbours not by their Intentions but by Events we pass a severe Law against our+selves because our Intentions are in our Power but Events are not and no Man can foresee the future My very Enemies must confess that my Calamity has proceeded not from any Extravagance of Temper or a luxurious Life but only from the too eager Desire of Getting which if it be a Fault who at present is guiltless Sure no Man ever was justly blam'd for catching a Distemper whose Infection was epidemical And yet that very eager Desire of Getting has not proceeded from any sordid Avarice but only from my Excess of Love to your Daughter and an earnest Zeal to secure her Happiness before I should be prevented by Sickness or Death or that usual Change which attends on Human Affairs So that my Eagerness to make your Daughter happy has been the very thing that has made her miserable by bringing under her Father's Displeasure one for whom she believes it her Duty to be concern'd  So that what she suffers by your Displeasure causes it to be more grievous to me and makes me more passionately and impatiently desire that you would be reconcil'd to me My Fault has been my Error and not my Crime and I have Youth and Health and Vigour of Mind enough to retrieve my Fortune And when I have retriev'd her I have Reason to believe that she will then be constant to me because I have seen and experienc'd the only Error which could have oblig'd her to leave me and therefore as soon as I am reestablish'd I shall be more happy because more secure than if I had never falln In the mean while Sir to give you a convincing Proof that I prefer your Daughter's Happiness to my own I am willing to do any thing to secure her a Competency while my own Condition is doubtful I am willing to put it as much out of my Power as it is contrary to my Inclinations to touch the other two thousand Pounds  I am SIR Your  c  June  TO JUDAS ISCARIOT  Esq  On the Degeneracy of the Publick Taste  SIR  ABout the middle of the last Month I sent you a long Letter in which I endeavour'd to shew the Extravagance of that Opinion that there is at this time among us an Improvement of the general Taste with relation to Poetry and the  Belles Lettres  And I promis'd in my next to shew the Error or the Falacy of those who pretend to maintain that Opinion from the crowded Audiences at the Representation of  Shakespear  's Plays and the thin ones at those which were writ by Mr  D  y  I promis'd to shew that notwithstanding this Practice of the present Frequenters of the PlayHouse they have it both in their Heads and their Hearts to value Mr  D'Urfey  and to despise  Shakespear  that neither their Approbation nor their Contempt is their own but assumed and borrowed and that they approve by  Vogue and by Fashion as a late noble Poet has told us  Their private Wish obey the publick Voice  'Twixt Good and Bad Whimsey decides not Choice  Fashions grow up for Taste at Forms they strike  They know what they would have not what they like  I promis'd to shew that the one of these Authors has been esteem'd and the other contemn'd by Men of Sense so long that the Approbation of the one and the Contempt of the other is come at last to make an Impression on the Rabble when I mention that Word I do not mean such a Rabble as you have sometimes on the Stage at  Julius Caesar  or at  Coriolanus  but such a Rabble as is but too often beheld in your Pit and SideBoxes  A very great Part of those who pretend to be in Love with  Shakespear  if he were now living and his most celebrated Plays were to be acted  De novo  without a Cabal without Character or Prepossession wou'd Hiss and Damn the very Things of which they are now the fashionable Admirers which seems plain to me from this very Reason because the modern Plays which they most approve of are the very Reverse  of  Shakespear  's with respect either to his Excellencies or his Faults  Shakespear  is very justly celebrated for the Truth and Justness of his Characters for the Beauty of his Sentiments for the Simplicity and Dignity of his Dialogue and for his moving the Passions powerfully by the meer force of Nature But the present Spectators of Tragedies approve of those most in which the Passions are mov'd least They will endure no Modern Tragedy in whose principal Character Love is not the predominant Quality Now Love predominating in the principal Character too often falsifies and confounds those Characters and by Consequence but too often destroys the Beauty of the Sentiments because no Sentiment can be beautiful which is improper in him who speaks it Besides there are not three of our modern Tragedies which have any thing like those Sentiments which abound in  Shakespear  Sentiments which at the same time that they shew Sagacity and Penetration are easie just and natural  The modern Readers and Spectators of Tragedies will endure no Tragedy which has the Simplicity and  naiveté  of  Shakespear  's Dialogue a Simplicity wherever the occasion requires it attended with Force and Dignity and Pomp and Solemnity Instead of that noble and natural Dialogue  they are for a flatulant Style in which the Poet puts the Change upon himself and speaks almost always himself instead of making his Characters speak  But as the Readers and Spectators of Modern Tragedies approve of those most which are the very reverse of  Shakespear  's with respect to his Beauties and Excellencies so they declare very loudly against his Faults The Faults of  Shakespear  which are rather those of the Age in which he liv'd are his perpetual Rambles and his apparent Duplicity in some of his Plays or Triplicity of Action and the frequent breaking the Continuity of the Scenes The present Spectators declare against this in appearance but at the same time approve of this Multiplicity of Action in some Modern Plays concealed by a Jumble and a Confusion which is incomprehensible and altogether unintelligible Another of  Shakespear  's Faults is the Length of Time employ'd in the carrying on his Dramatick Action The present Spectators are extreamly shock'd at this in a modern Tragedy but at the same time approve of those in which the Unity of Time is preserved by offending all Common Sense  If a Modern Poet in one of his Tragedies should shew any Thing like  Shakespear  's Rambles should introduce a Tragedy upon the Stage which should begin in  Europe  and end in  Asia  like the Moor of  Venice  that Play would be exploded and damn'd with very great Damnation But the Modern Spectators of Tragedies greatly esteem and are fond of those in which the Unity of Place is preserv'd sometimes by whimsical comick Absurdities and sometimes by dreadful and prodigious Extravagancies  From all this I conclude as I said before that the Spectators of modern Tragedies having the greatest Esteem for those which have least of  Shakespear  's Excellencies and declaring loudly against his Faults would damn  Shakespear  if living  Nor can I believe that several who pretend to be passionate Admirers of  Milton  would treat him if living in any other manner for the following Reasons  Because they are so fond of nothing as of that soft and effeminate Rhyme which makes the very Reverse of the Harmony and of the manly and powerful and noble Enthusiasm of  Milton  Because the Generality of Poets and Wits his Contemporaries did not esteem him tho' they were by no means inferior in Understanding to his pretended living Admirers  Willmot  Earl of  Rochester  never so much as mention'd him in his Imitation of the Tenth Satyr of the first Book of  Horace  When he came to imitate that  Passage  Forte epos Acer ut nemo Varius ducit  instead of  Milton  he names  Waller  And when that noble Peer was some Years  erwards ask'd by Dr  Burnet  since Bishop of  Salisbury  for which of the Modern Poets he had most Esteem he answer'd without the least Hesitation for  Boileau  among the  French  and  Cowley  among the  English  Poets Mr  Rymer  in his first Book of Criticism treated the  Paradise Lost  with Contempt and the generality of the Readers of Poetry for twenty Years after it was published knew no more of that exalted Poem than if it had been writ in  Arabick  Mr  Dryden  in his Preface before  the State of Innocence  appears to have been the first those Gentlemen excepted whose Verses are before  Milton  's Poem who discover'd in so publick a Manner an extraordinary Opinion of  Milton  's extraordinary Merit And yet Mr  Dryden  at that time knew not half the Extent of his Excellence as more than twenty Years afterwards he confess'd to me and as is pretty plain from his writing  the State of Innocence  For Mr  Dryden  in that Poem which is founded on the  Paradise Lost  falls so infinitely short of those wonderful Qualities by which  Milton  has distinguish'd that noble Poem from all other Poems that one of these two Things must be granted either that Mr  Dryden  knew  not the Extent of  Milton  's great Qualities or that he design'd to be a Foil to him But they who knew Mr  Dryden  know very well that he was not of a Temper to design to be a Foil to any one  I hope I have said enough to convince you that the Approbations and Censures of the Generality of an Audience are deriv'd from Sentiments which are not their own and which are the Effects of Authority and not of Reason When Men who are and are esteem'd Persons of more than ordinary Judgment have declar'd themselves from time to time during a Century or half a Century concerning Poems Dramatick or others those Declarations are the Cause that other Persons at length being guided by the Light which is held out to them fondly imagine that it was kindled by that Particle of Heav'nly Fire which they fancy to be within them But the numerous and violent Cabals which are form'd to support or decry Dramatick Writings may serve instead of a thousand Arguments to convince the most obstinate that there is no such thing as a general Taste among us It being absolutely impossible that great Numbers of Persons of a fine Discernment and a true Taste should conspire to extol a Blockhead at the Expence of a noble Art at the Expence of their own Reputation and the Reputation of their  Country and consequently at the Ex  ence in a good measure of that Coun  ry's Power and Interest You and your  rethren who are the present Managers  the PlayHouse have of late very justly  ewn the extremest Contempt for the ge  eral Taste pretending to set off damn'd  lays by the glare of new Habits Which  onduct of you the Emperors and Kings  nd Princes of the Drama recalls to my Re  embrance what  Boccalin  says of some Princes of  Parnassus  They had half ru  'd themselves says that merry  Italian  by  he Expence they had been at to preserve  nd perfume Sirreverences Yet still says  e the more Cost they were at and the more Sweets they bestow'd upon them the more damnably their Conserves stunk in  he Nostrils of all who had really Noses Perhaps if you take the Word in the most diffusive Sense there never was a general good Taste for Poetry among any People in the World if you except the  Athenians  But there never was so general a one in  England  as there was in modern  France  and  Italy  before the Opera and some other Things debauch'd it in both those Countries  There has not one great Poet appear'd in  France  since the beginning of Cardinal  Richlieu  's Ministry but he has been protected and encourag'd and his Merit  as fast as it could spread has been generally acknowledg'd I wish I could as truly affirm the same thing of  England  The great Qualities of  Milton  were not generally known among his Countrymen till the  Paradise Lost  had been publish'd more than thirty Years But when that admirable Poet was among the  Italians  the Greatness of his Genius was known to them in the very Bloom of his Youth even thirty Years before that incomparable Poem was writ witness the Epigram of  Selvaggi  an  Italian  Poet of which  Dryden  's Epigram which is under  Milton  's Picture is nothing but a Paraphrase  Graecia Maeonidem jactet sibi Roma Maronem  Anglia Miltonum jactat utrique parem  Nay  Salsiki  a  Roman  Poet sacrifices the very Honour of his Country that is of modern  Italy  to him by preferring the  Italian  Poetry of  Milton  even to that of  Tasso  Cede Meles cedat depressâ Moxéius urnâ  Sebetus Tassum desinatusque loqui  At Thamesis victor cunctis ferat altior undas  Nam per Te Milto partribus unus erat  And  Giovanni Baptista Manso  a Noble  Neapolitan  who had been the intimate Friend of  Tasso  and the great Patron of  Marino  while they were living gives extraordinary Commendations to  Milton  tho' he was then but a Youth among them as appears by his  Latin  Verses addrest to that noble  Italian    Ergo ego Te Clius magni nomine Phoebi  Manse pater jubeo longum salvere per aevum  Missus Hyperboreo Juvenis peregrinus ab axe  Milton  had then been so far from writing the  Paradise Lost  that he had never so much as thought of that Subject but had at that time determin'd after his Return to  England  to write an Epick Poem upon the Exploits of  Arthur  and the Knights of the Round Table as appears by the same Verses to  Manso  Arthurumque etiam sub Terris bella moventem  Dicam atque invictae sociali federemensae  Magnanimos Heroas o modo spiritus adsit  Frangam Saxonicas Britonum sub marte phalanges  Thus you see the  Italians  by his juvenile Essays discover'd the great and  growing Genius of  Milton  whereas  Countrymen knew very little of him even thirty Years after he had publish'd among them the noblest Poem in the World  But as the general Taste of  England  could be never said to be good it was never so bad as it is at present a certain Proof of which is that Writings both Dramatick and others were never so infamous as they now are And Taste and Writing always keep Pace with each other When  Shakespear  first appear'd among us the Generality of his Readers and his Spectators were much better able to judge of him than they are at present Because as he was a very natural Writer and they were without Prejudice without Prepossession and without Affectation and without the Influence of a Coxcomical Senseless Cabal they were at Liberty to receive the Impressions which Things naturally made on their Minds  HamptonCourt  May  TO Sir RICHARD STEELE  Declaring the Reasons for which I publish'd the two Volumes of SELECT WORKS  SIR  I Here send you by the Bearer several Pieces in Verse and Prose writ formerly by me and lately printed in two Volumes but I send them not without a double Design on you For first I desire that you wou'd have the Goodness to oblige your Managers to make me some Recompence this Winter for the Wrong which they did me the last Secondly I desire that you will give me leave to say something concerning  he Pieces contain'd in these two Volumes  nd more particularly concerning the Motive which oblig'd me to write the chief of them at the first and to publish them lately together which I shall do with Pleasure  to one who has done so much Good in the same Cause in which most of them were writ  Several of the Pieces in Verse and Prose and three of the Plays were writ in the Cause of Liberty The narrative Poems of greater Length were all of them written upon Great and Publick Occasions and were design'd as so many Panegyricks upon those Illustrious Persons whoseGreat and Heroick Actions had made them Benefactors to  Great Britain  and Liberty  It has always been my Opinion that a free Nation can never be too zealous in maintaining their Liberties because we have been taught by too many fatal Events that they have at last been often lost by the Security and Corruptions of those who had for several Centuries enjoy'd them Witness the ancient  Grecians  and  Romans  and the ancient and modern  Spaniards  and  French  But whenever the Liberties of a great Nation are in manifest Danger there all the several Members of it who are not abjectly base will use their utmost Efforts in defending them The Liberties of  Great Britain  have in our own Memory been in so much Danger that they have been twice in thirty Years retrieved from immediate Ruin first by the Revolution and secondly by the Accession of King  George  to the Imperial Crown of this Island but even  now they by no Means appear to me to be entirely secur'd  Since the Revolution things appear to have been strangely reverst in  Great Britain  with regard to Liberty In four or five Reigns immediately preceding the Arrival of King  William  of Immortal Memory the Court was for Arbitrary Power and the People appear'd strenuous for Liberty But since that time the Court has for the most part contended for Liberty and the People I mean too great a Part of them have declar'd for Slavery Now if ever we  hould come to be under a King who wou'd  acrifice his Protestant Dissenting Subjects  the HighChurch Clergy we should  uickly see whether the Liberties of a Na  on are most secure when a considerable Part of the People who are their natural Guardians are resov'd to defend or deter  in'd to resign them In the mean time  it must be acknowledg'd to the im  ortal Honour of the present King that  endeavouring to secure the Dissenters  om such a Treatment in time to come he taking  the most effectual Method to im  ortalize Liberty  Thus Sir have I acquainted you with  only Motive of writing the chief of  ese Poems which was the Apprehension  had of the Danger which the Liberties  my Country were in and consequently  the Liberties of the Christian World of which ours are the strongest Bulwark I wrote them not then as one who espous'd a Party but as a Lover of my Country and one zealous to promote the Happiness of  Great Britain  I have been so far from having any ambitious Aims or any sordid Views of Interest that I have been contented to see several of the publick Rewards engross'd by some who are lukewarm and by others who are  Jacobites  in Whig Cloathing while I have remain'd very poor in a very advanc'd Age But one Thing indeed I have sometimes been apt to think exceeding hard and that is that these lukewarm Persons and these  Jacobites  in Whig Cloathing should be suffer'd to make use of the Power which they have acquir'd by their Falshood to the utter Ruin of one who has behav'd himself all along with the utmost Sincerity in the noblest Cause of Liberty  Thus Sir have I laid before you the Motive which engag'd me to write the greater part of the Pieces which are contain'd in the two Volumes I shall now shew you how the same Motive oblig'd me to use my Endeavours to preserve them▪ if they should appear worthy of it and consequently to publish them in the two fore+mention'd Volumes It was in  October  that I desir'd a Bookseller to collect them for me I thought that after so much Time had pass'd since the writing them I should be capable of forming as true a Judgment my self of them as any other Person whatsoever who has no better Judgment in Poetical Matters than I have or that the Precept of  Horace nonum prematur in annum  must be false and vain  Upon a very slow and deliberate Perusal of them I could not but conclude that with all their Faults they were not altogether depriv'd of that noble Fire which alone can make them pleasing nor of that Justness and Solidity which alone can make them lasting I believ'd that if they were publish'd together they might be able one Day to do some Good to the publick and no Discredit to me  And I was the more encourag'd to venture on this Publication because Sir you may be pleas'd to remember that they had been favourably receiv'd by the most illustrious Persons of both Parties for their Judgment in Poetry and their Knowledge of the  Belles Lettres  by the late Earls of  Godolphin  and  Halifax  Mr  Maynwaring  and others among the Whigs and by the present Duke of  Buckingham  and my Lord  Lansdown  among the Tories And if any Temptation could make me vain it would  be the favourable Opinions of the last two Noble Persons because as their Judgments in matters of Poetry are unquestion'd they can never be suppos'd to be partial to one who has all his Lifetime appear'd very zealous in contrary Principles to those of a Party which they by some have been suppos'd to favour My Lord  Lansdown  by making me a Present so noble as never has been made by a Subject to any Author now living sufficiently declar'd that what I had writ had not been altogether displeasing to him And 'tis to the warm Approbation which the Duke of  Buckingham  gave to the Poem on the Battel of  Blenheim  that I owe the Honour of being first known to the late illustrious Earl of  Godolphin  whose good and great Qualities and the Benefits which  Great Britain  receiv'd from his good and his wise Administration make me proud to own for the first and greatest of my Benefactors  Thus Sir I found Encouragement to preserve these Pieces and especially the Poems writ in the Cause of Liberty But I was convinc'd at the same time that the only way to preserve them would be to publish them together They were in a great many different Hands and some of them in the Hands of such who were mortal Enemies to the Cause in which they  were written Some of them had been very incorrectly printed The very Subject which ought to recommend them to all  Englishmen  as well as the Harmony without Rhyme in several of the Poems made some of them for the present less pleasing to above half the Readers of Poetry Some of them that had once appear'd with Applause seem'd to have been forgot For all things of late Days have been manag'd by Cabal and Party and there seems to have been a Conspiracy in the Commonwealth of Learning among Fools of all Sorts to exalt Folly at the Expence of Commonsense and make Stupidity triumph over Merit in the very Dominions of Wit which has been one of the Causes why Things are reduced to that deplorable State upon our  British Parnassus Apollo  and the Muses seem to have abandon'd it disdaining that their Divinities should honour a Place with their Songs where Fools and Pedants Buffoons Eunuchs and Tumblers have so often met with Applause  Who could have thought if he had been told twenty Years ago that he should outlive Tragedy and Comedy that he had been promis'd a Life of not quite twenty Years Yet 'tis very plain that the Promise had extended no further such is the Power of Cabal and Party  I have all along had a great Aversion to the making a Party or the entring into a Cabal and have sometimes look'd upon it with Horrour and sometimes with Contempt Who that has Commonsense can forbear laughing when he sees a Parcel of Fellows who call themselves Wits sit in Combination round a Coffee Table as Sharpers do round a Hazard Table to trick honest Gentlemen into an Approbation of their Works and bubble them of their Understandings  And yet I have all along known that nothing in the greater Poetry can grow immediately popular without a Cabal or Party I have a long time been convinced that the more sublimely any thing is writ in Poetry and the nearer it comes to Perfection the longer it will be before it grows popular without such a Cabal because the more sublimely it is writ and the nearer it comes to Perfection the more it is rais'd above the Apprehensions of the Vulgar And yet notwithstanding this Knowledge I have all along resolv'd to have no Reputation or to owe it to my Writings  Thus Sir you see the Reasons why the Writings that make up these two Volumes or at least the greater Part of them had been in danger of being lost if I had not taken Pains during my Lifetime to correct and publish them together There  is one more Reason remaining and that is the Malice of those People whom the World calls Poets whose Hatred I have been proud to incur by speaking bold and necessary Truths in the behalf of a noble Art which they have miserably abus'd by their vile Poems and their more vile Criticisms And yet 'tis from these People that the foolish Readers of Poetry which are nine Parts in ten take their Opinions of Poets and their Works little believing or once imagining that these Persons are of all Mankind the very worst qualify'd to judge of their own Art as having neither the Capacity nor the Impartiality which are requisite for the judging truly For it will be found generally speaking that Poets Painters and Musicians are capacitated less than other Men to judge of Poetry Painting and Musick This I must confess may appear to some to be so bold a Paradox that I shall endeavour to make it out both by Reason and Authority tho' I know very well at the same time that You can make no Doubt of it The Generality of Poets Painters and Musicians are such by the meer Power of a warm Imagination And 'tis very rarely that a strong Imagination and a penetrating Judgment are found in the same Subject We need go no further than  Boileau  to hear  that a celebrated Poet is often a contemptible Judge  Tel excelle a Rimer qui Juge sottement  Et tel s'est fait par ses Vers distinguer par la ville  Qui jamais du Lucain n'a distingue Virgile  As for what relates to Painters I shall content my self with the Citation of a Remark from the ingenious and judicious Author of the Observations upon  Fresnoy  's Art of Painting translated by Mr  Dryden  'Tis the Fiftieth Remark upon these Words of Mr  Dryden  's Translation 'As being the 'Sovereign Judge of his own Art  This Word Sovereign Judge or Arbiter of his own Art presupposes a Painter to be fully instructed in all the Parts of Painting so that being set as it were above his Art he may be the Master and Sovereign of it which is no easie Matter Those of that Profession are so seldom endow'd with that supream Capacity that few of them arrive to be good Judges of Painting And I should many times make more account of their Judgment who are Men of Sense and yet have never touch'd a Pencil than of the Opinion which is given by the greatest part of Painters All Painters therefore may be call'd Arbiters of their own Art but to  be Sovereign Arbiters belongs only to knowing Painters  What is said by this ingenious Gentleman of Painters is exactly true of Musicians For which I have the Opinion of more than one Master among them and as to the Truth of this Observation with relation to Poets I have said enough above  But as Poets are not capable so neither are they impartial Judges I speak of those who are only Rhimesters For a great Master is for the most part as impartial as he is knowing but for the rest the Readers of Poetry would do well to consider that if a Mistress who is courted by a great many passionate Rivals should ask any one of them his Opinion of the rest 'tis ten to one that he would prefer him most whom he esteem'd least and whom he believ'd  east capable of getting that Mistress from him  Thus Sir have I acquainted you with the Motive which oblig'd me to write the greater Part of these Treatises and which afterwards engag'd me to publish them in the two Volumes which you will receive with this I hope I shall not be thought troublesome if in a second Letter I say something in particular of the Pieces both in Verse and Prose However these two Letters will at least convince you of the  good Opinion which I have a long time entertain'd both of your Discernment and your Impartiality  I am SIR Your most Humble and most Obedient Servant JOHN DENNIS  Sep  TO THO SERGEANT  Esq  That all StockJobbers are Slaves  SIR  I Had sooner returned you my Thanks for the favour of your last and the good Advice in it if I had not entertain'd some Thoughts of waiting on you which I had certainly done before now if it had not been for the Reflection that here of late you are scarce any where to be found but in  ExchangeAlley  and what good Christian would go to a Place where he is sure to meet the Devil at every Turn that he takes there not indeed with his Infernal Equipage his Browantlers his Saucer Eyes his long Tail and his cloven Feet He wears nothing of all this in  ExchangeAlley  except sometimes his Horns But then I should meet him at every Turn in more frightful and more provoking Appearances as now in the Shape of a Roguish leering  Broker and anon like a ghastly ruin'd StockJobber sometimes in the Shape of a young Lady who has lost both the Modesty and the natural Desire of her Sex and sometimes I should see him in the same Shape in which he fell from Heav'n that is like a Star of the first magnitude shining in an azure Sky For that old Gentleman who understands his Interest better than any Mortal living frequents no one Spot on the  Globe  so much as  ExchangeAlley  For there he constantly finds new Occasion to exercise his old Talents his Tempting Lying Deluding and Betraying  I shew'd the Acclamation at the latter end of your Letter to a Friend who was with me when it came  Vive la Mer pacifique  What says he does this come from a Sharper I desir'd to know what made him ask that Question You know said he that there are two constant Hazard Tables or Wheels of Fortune that are establish'd by Authority in this wicked Town not to mention a third which is sometimes at  GuildHall  but transitory and occasional that one of these two is in the neighbourhood of  WhiteHall  establish'd by the Authority of the Court and the other near the  RoyalExchange  establish'd by another Authority Now the Table in the Neighbourhood of  WhiteHall  is a fair and impartial one at which only Men of Honour  play at least they are Men of Honour while they are there whatever they may be when they are in other Places But the Hazard Table near the  Exchange  is frequented by the greatest Sharpers about this tricking Town There are Bullies to be seen every Day in Crowds with their Boxes and their false Dice sometimes they make use of High Runners sometimes of Low Runners and sometimes of Doctors And this their Sharping and their Cheating is Christen'd forsooth their Being in the Secret So that Being in the Secret will shortly come to signifie something more scandalous even than open Infamy  Well but said I even at that tricking Table my Friend plays upon the Square and is in no Secret But then said he let me ask you another Question Is your Friend a Lover of his Country That is a stranger Question than the other said I Every one is a Lover of his Country or at least every one pretends to be so But replyed he can any one who would be so much as thought to love his Country approve so heartily of a Method which if 'tis practised much longer will infallibly ruin it For besides that Strangers run away with vast Sums of our Money who came in at Seventy perhaps and go out at Seven Hundred is not our Trade by this StockJobbing brought to a narrower Compass  They who are ruin'd by it are unable to carry on their Commerce and they who have gain'd vast Sums by it have been apt to think themselves above their Professions and laugh at the getting ten or twenty  per Cent  by a long Voyage when in  ExchangeAlley  they can propose to gain fifty  per Cent  in a Morning Now as our Trade decreases continued he our Seamen must decrease proportionably so that at last perhaps it will be impossible upon an exigence to Man our Royal Navy And then we may happen to become a Prey to the first Invader So that this Lover of his Country is heartily approving of a Method which may one Day bring this Island to be a conquered Province and his own Posterity to be wretched Slaves As soon as I perceived that he paus'd I told him that this would have been more  a propos  if he had spoke it before the late Act of Parliament for the putting down of the Bubbles But he answer'd they being put down by the Wisdom of the Legislature for this very Reason least any Prejudice should acrue to Trade from them and  Ram  's and  Onslow  's Bubbles being establish'd by the same Wisdom have not the Legislature plainly declared that Trade could receive no Damage from them and that we may deliver to the Winds our fears of Conquest and of Slavery Ought not every one to  acquiesce in what they have done and can any one be extravagant enough to believe that they would establish two Bubbles against the Publick Good only for the sake of a little transitory Pelf which is to come into particular Hands Very good said my Friend but are not those Gentlemen who constantly frequent  ExchangeAlly  actually Slaves already as errant as vile as miserable Slaves as those who rowe in the Galleys Say'st thou so my dear Friend said I do but make that out and thou shalt to me be  Apollo  and all the Muses But this is a new Paradox Not so new neither said he The whole Sect of the Stoicks embraced it The Stoicks I told him were fantastical People In some things he allow'd they were so but that for the most part their Morality was more sound  han that of any other Sect among  he Heathens  Horace  who was of no Sect but who took from each of them what he thought was just and solid and by the way he wanted no Judgment no Discernment that could enable him to make a right Choice made this Opinion  is own as you may see by the Sixteenth Epistle of his First Book  Qui melior Servo qui Liberior sit Avarus  Non video Nam qui cupiet metuet quoque porrò  Qui metuens vivet Liber mibi non erit unquam  But my dear Friend said I the Authority of a  Roman  Poet will hardly bring the Gentlemen in  ExchangeAlley  off from their StockJobbing This is an Authority he reply'd which carries Reason along with it For thus he argues The Covetous Man desires he who desires of consequence fears but he who lives in continual Fear must in my Opinion be always an errant Slave But continued he I will add my own Reasons to those of  Horace  There are two sorts of Liberties said he a Civil and a Philosophical Liberty What we call Civil Liberty gives us the command of our own Actions What we call Philosophical Liberty gives us the command of our own Thoughts Now neither the Galleyslave nor the StockJobbe can be said to enjoy Civil Liberty that is neither the one nor the other has the freedom of his own Actions For a GalleySlave must Row and a StockJobber must StockJobb And it signifies nothing to the purpose that the one upon his Refusal or upon his Neglect is corrected by a Cat of Ninetayls and the other by the Stings of his own base Passion since they are both  equally under Compulsion and the StockJobber though never so wealthy is as much afraid of missing the Hours of  Jonathan  's or of  Garroway  's as the poor Galleyslave is of being wanting to his turn at the Oar But now to come to Philosophical Liberty in that the Galleyslave has infinitely  he Advantage of the StockJobber For while the former is chain'd to his Oar his Thoughts may be as free as the Air his Thoughts may wander o'er the Universe may wander through Eternity and while his Body is in the utmost Agitation his Mind may be calm and compos'd But  e StockJobber's Thoughts are more con  in'd than the other's Body confin'd to Dirt and the sordid means of accumula  ng it and his Mind is often plagu'd by  he most tormentiug Passions The poor Galleyslave may be a virtuous and an ex  ellent Man but the wealthy StockJobber must always be in the number of pro  ligate Sinners  Perdidit arma locum virtutis deseruit qui  Semper in augenda festinat obruitur re  Ep Lib  That is he who has his Thoughts in  ent upon the Means of heaping up Mo  ey has thrown away his Buckler has deserted  his Post the noble Post of Virtue where his General placed him and which it was his Duty to maintain at the Expence of Life it self He has lost it he has been beaten out of it by his base Passions and by his abject Vices by his Fraud his Desire his Hope his Fear and his Rage The Galleyslave may have it firmly in his Mind and in his Will to do all the Duties of the best of Men to be a faithful Lover of his Country and to serve it to the utmost of his power to be a good Father a good Son a good Husband a good Brother he may be dear to all his Friends and Relations and have the heartiest kindest Wishes of all But as the miserable StockJobber cares only for himself he is dear to himself alone and contemptible and hateful to all besides and one may say to him in the Words of  Horace    Non uxor salvum te vult non filius▪ omnes  Vicini oderunt noti pueri atque puellae  Miraris quum tu argento post omnia ponas  Si nemo praestet quem non merearis amorem  For a true StockJobber will sacrifice Wife Father Child Brother and his Country it self for Gain He who sacrifice  the latter will sacrifice the rest And have we not a thousand Instances every Day that a StockJobber will sacrifice his Country  But there is still another thing in which the Galleyslave has by much the Advantage of the StockJobber The former is a redeemable Slave but the latter is in Chains for his Life Fortune or Time may release the Slaves who are at  Algiers  or  Tripoli  but Fortune and Time are both the StockJobbers Foes Length of Days will certainly augment his Avarice and make his Captivity ruder And the more Wealth there shall chance to flow in upon him the more will he desire the less will he enjoy and still the more abject a Slave will he be to the base Lust of Gold But my dear Friend said I who had heard him hitherto with Patience Thou certainly believ'st that thou art in a Pulpit for it is there that right or wrong a Man has the Priviledge of talking for an Hour without being interrupted Sir said he I stand corrected but I did not deserve this Remonstrance only for complying with your own Desire You know very well that 'tis not my custom to talk all and that I have more than once suffered you to Preach in your turn No Man he continued has a worse Opinion than I have of an eternal Talker That which makes him so insufferable  is that tho' he is for the most part a very empty Coxcomb yet he implicitely declares that into what Company soever he lights he alone has more Understanding than all the rest of the Company together that Nature has qualified him to prescribe to others and that God who made him created him perpetual Dictator But as I know you continued he to be sometimes an errant Wag with a very grave Countenance I am perhaps very much in the wrong to take what you say seriously I leave you to ruminate on what I have told you and shall expect to know your Opinion of it the next time I see you So we parted But before I give him my Opinion I desire to know yours  I am SIR Your  c  WhiteHall  June  TO Sir RICHARD STEELE  Patentee of the Theatre in  DruryLane  SIR  THO' at the time of writing this I am almost overwhelm'd both with Sickness and Grief yet I cannot forbear making a just Complaint to you for your being the Occasion of both these either by actually breaking your Word with me or being perfectly passive while your Managers broke it which if it has not reduc'd me to immediate Necessity yet has brought me within the Danger of it and consequently within the Apprehension of it which is as grievous almost as the Thing And that this Complaint is but too justly grounded you your self will acknowledge when I have laid my Case before you which I shall do in as few Words as I can  It was upon the th of  February  that I receiv'd a Letter from Mr  Booth  by your Direction and the Direction of the Managers under you desiring me to dine  at your House on the th and after Dinner to read the Tragedy of  Coriolanus  to you which I had alter'd from  Shakespear  You cannot but remember Sir that upon reading it the Play with the Alterations was approv'd of nay and warmly approv'd of by your self Mr  Cibber  and Mr  Booth  the other Manager was not there and that Resolutions were taken for the acting it in the beginning of this Winter Now I appeal to your self if any Dramatick Performance could be more seasonable in the beginning of a Winter when we were threatned with an Invasion from  Sweden  on the North and from  Spain  on the West than a Tragedy whose Moral is thus exprest in the last Lines of the Play  They who thro' Ambition or Revenge  Or impious Interest join with Foreign Foes  T' oppress or to destroy their native Country  Shall find like  Coriolanus  soon or late  From their perfidious Foreign Friends their Fate  I am sure Sir I need not tell one of your Understanding that this Moral is so apparently the Foundation of the Dramatick Action and must appear to every Spectator and Reader to be so truly the genuine Result of it that if I had not said one Word of it every Reader and Spectator  would have been able to have suggested so much to himself  Well Sir when the Winter came on what was done by your Deputies Why instead of keeping their Word with me they spent above two Months of the Season in getting up  All for Love or the World well lost  a Play which has indeed a noble first Act an Act which ends with a Scene becoming of the Dignity of the Tragick Stage But if  Horace  had been now alive and been either a Reader or Spectator of that Entertainment he would have passed his old Sentence upon the Author  Infelix operis summâ quia ponere totum  Nesciet  For was ever any thing so pernicious so immoral so criminal as the Design of that Play I have mention'd the Title of it give me leave to set before you the two last Lines  And Fame to late Posterity shall tell  No Lovers liv'd so great or dy'd so well  And this Encomium of the Conduct and the Death of  Anthony  and  Cleopatra  a Conduct so immoral and a Selfmurder so criminal is to give it more Force put into the Mouth of the HighPriest of  Isis  tho'  that Priest could not but know that what he thus commended would cause immediately the utter Destruction of his Country and make it become a Conquer'd and a  Roman  Province Certainly never could the Design of an Author square more exactly with the Design of  WhiteHall  at the time when it was written which was by debauching the People absolutely to enslave them  For pray Sir what do the Title and the two last Lines of this Play amount to in plain  English  Why to this that if any Person of Quality or other shall turn away his Wife his young affectionate virtuous charming Wife for all these  Octavia  was to take to his Bed a loose abandon'd Prostitute and shall in her Arms exhaust his Patrimony destroy his Health emasculate his Mind and lose his Reputation and all his Friends why all this is well and greatly done his Ruine is his Commendation And if afterwards in Despair he either hangs or drowns himself or goes out of the World like a Rat with a Dose of Arsenick or Sublimate why 'tis a great and an envied Fate he dies nobly and heroically It is Sir with extream Reluctance that I have said all this For I would not be thought to affront the Memory of Mr  Dryden  for whose extraordinary Qualities no Man has a greater Veneration than my self But  that all Considerations ought to give Place to the Publick Good is a Truth of which you of all Men I am sure can never doubt  And can you believe then after having recommended Virtue and Publick Spirit for so many Years to the World that you can give your Subalterns Authority to preach up Adultery to a Town which stands so little in need of their Doctrine Is not the Chastity of the Marriage Bed one of the chief Incendiaries of Publick Spirit and the Frequency of Adulteries one of the chief Extinguishers of it according to that of  Horace  Foecunda culpae secula nuptias  Primum inquinavere Genus Domos  Hoc Fonte derivata clades  In patriam populumque fluxit  For when Adultery's become so frequent especially among Persons of Condition upon whose Sentiments all Publick Spirit chiefly depends that a great many Husbands begin to believe or perhaps but to suspect that they who are called their Children are not their own I appeal to you Sir if that Belief or that Suspicion must not exceedingly cool their Zeal for the Welfare of those Children and consequently for the Welfare of Posterity  As I had infinitely the Advantage of  All  for Love  in the Moral of  Coriolanus  I had it by Consequence in the whole Tragedy for the  Coriolanus  as I have alter'd it having a just Moral and by Consequence at the Bottom a general and allegorical Action and universal and allegorical Characters and for that very reason a Fable is therefore a true Tragedy if it be not a just and a regular one but 'tis as just and as regular as I could make it upon so irregular a Plan as  Shakespear  's Whereas  All for Love  having no Moral and consequently no general and allegorical Action nor general and allegorical Characters can for that Reason have no Fable and therefore can be no Tragedy 'Tis indeed only a particular Account of what happen'd formerly to  Anthony  and  Cleopatra  and a most pernicious Amusement  And as I had the Advantage in the Merit of  Coriolanus  I had it likewise in the World's Opinion of the Merit and Reputation of  Shakespear  in Tragedy above that of Mr  Dryden  For let Mr  Dryden  's Genius for Tragedy be what it will he has more than once publickly own'd that it was much inferior to  Shakespear  's and particularly in those two remarkable Lines in his Prologue to  AurengeZebe  And when he hears his Godlike  Romans  rage  He in a just Despair would quit the Stage  And in the Verses to Sir  Godfrey Kneller  Shakespear  thyGift I place before my Sight  With Awe I ask his Blessing ere I write  With Reverence look on his majestick Face  Proud to be less but of his Godlike Race  And the same Mr  Dryden  has more than once declar'd to me that there was something in this very Tragedy of  Coriolanus  as it was writ by  Shakespear  that is truly great and truly  Roman  and I more than once answer'd him that it had always been my own Opinion Now I appeal to you and your Managers if it has lost any thing under my Hands  But what is more considerable than all this your Deputy Lieutenants for the Stage have ten times the Opinion of the Advantage which  Shakespear  has over Mr  Dryden  in Tragedy than either I or the rest of the World have Ever since I was capable of reading  Shakespear  I have always had and have always exprest that Veneration for him which is justly his due of which I believe no one can doubt who has read the Essay which I publish'd some Years ago upon his Genius and Writings But what they express upon all Occasions is not Esteem is not Admiration but flat Idolatry  And lastly I had the Advantage of the very Opinion which those People had of  their own Interest in the Case They knew very well that it was but twelve Years since  All for Love  had been acted And they were likewise satisfied that from its first Run as they call to the beginning of this last Winter it had never brought four Audiences together At the same time there was no Occasion to tell them that the  Coriolanus  of  Shakespear  had not been acted in twenty Years and that when it was brought upon the Stage twenty Years ago it was acted twenty Nights together  And now Sir I shall be oblig'd to you if you will acquaint me for what mighty and unknown Reason the  Coriolanus  notwithstanding yours and their warm Approbation of it notwithstanding your Words solemnly given to act it as soon as it could conve+niently be brought upon the Stage this Winter notwithstanding the Merit of the Play it self I speak of  Shakespear  's part of it notwithstanding the World's and their own Opinion of the superior Merit of  Shakespear  to Mr  Dryden  in Tragedy and their very Opinion of their own Interest in the Case nay notwithstanding the exact Seasonableness of the Moral for the Service of King  George  and of  Great Britain  which above all things ought to have been consider'd by those who call themselves the King's Servants and who act under his Authority I say Sir I should be extremely oblig'd to  you if you would tell me what powerful Reason could so far prevail over all those I have mention'd as to engage them to postpone the  Coriolanus  not only for  All for Love  but likewise for that lamentable Tragick Farce  Caezar Borgia  from which no Body expected any thing but themselves and a Comedy after it call'd  the Masquerade  from which they themselves declar'd they expected nothing  I am  c  March  TO Mr PENKETHMAN  I Had certainly call'd upon thee at  Richmond  before now if it had not been for the Easterly Winds which made the coming by Water impracticable to one who is indispos'd by reason of the cold attending them But thou hast no reason to be concern'd at my Delay For this is no time to write waggish Letters to his Grace In the mean while I have thought of a Project for thee which will certainly do thy Business Thou shalt e'en turn Author and write a Play Thou wilt tell me perhaps that thou art not qualified For that very Reason thou shalt write one because for that very Reason thou wilt certainly succeed But perhaps thou wilt tell me that thou shalt write a very damn'd Play indeed A stronger Reason still for thy Writing For the more damnable thy Play happens to be  the greater and more flaming will thy Success be And so like a modern Author or a modern Female Beggar thou shalt supply thy own infinite Wants by the infinite Wants of thy Offspring But why art thou not qualified Friend  Pinky  There are nowadays but three Qualifications requisite for the succeeding upon the Stage The first is the want of that same For thou know'st the Belly is  Ingenii largitor  The second Qualification is that as modern Criticks when they come to a new Play are never without a Catcall a modern Poet who writes such a Play should never be without a Foolcall He must have the knack of jugging Fools into a Pit as a Country Squire does Partridges into a Trammel The third Qualification and which is necessary for the inforcing the other two is what they call a Stock a very great Stock not a Stock of Silver nor yet of Gold but of a Metal more powerful than either and which commands them both Now upon the Foot of these three Qualifications who the Devil is half so well qualified for the writing a Comedy as thou art Is it Proctor  John Littlewit  or  Scribble Dash  the Inns of  Chancery  Bard Or the Czar's old Soldier Friend  Pinky  thou art never modest but in the wrong Place Why none of these are worthy to carry thy Cloak after thee and hardly worthy to  carry thy Friend  Tom  's For where as thou art a living breathing Comedy they are a leash of dull Devils who are Tragedy all over Their very Jests are deep Tragedy They never endeavour to make us laugh but they move Terror and Compassion Their very Offer at a Jest moves Terror and 'tis no sooner out but it moves Compassion But as for thee thou hast nothing to do but to write a long Part for thy self and then if thou hast no Jest in thy  Chit Chat  thou wilt have a perpetual one in thy Person and that will do thy Business  I am Thy very Humble  March  To RICHARD NORTON of  Southwick    Esq  sent to him by Mr BOOTH when the Players went last down to act at his House  SIR  I take this Occasion of Mr  Booth  's going down to  Southwick  to acquaint you  hat I have been several times to wait on you  his Summer in  Bloomsbury  with four Acts of  Appius  and  Virginia  in Obedience to a Summons which I receiv'd from you by Colonel  B  And I would take this Opportunity to wait on you at  Southwick  instead of writing to you if some Business of Consequence did not absolutely oblige me to be nearer the Town But as soon as ever I have finish'd this Tragedy  Appius  shall wait upon you in my stead You Sir have been always one of those whom I have been proud to please But it would give me a very particular Satisfaction to find this Tragedy which was written in the  Cause of Liberty agreeable to one who has always shewn himself so good a Patriot and so great a Judge I make no doubt Sir but that you do me the Justice to believe that tho' Fortune denies me the Happiness of going down to  Southwick  my Heart and Soul will be there If we had not a more than common Esteem and Respect for you we should certainly envy you for drawing down into the Country the noblest Diversion of the Town Nature has combin'd with Fortune to make you compleatly happy You have it in your Power and you have it in your Will to set before your Eyes ev'n in the midst of Solitude the most agreeable Conversation both of the Court and Town and to join the reasonable Delights of these with the Sweets of your own charming Retirement Thus you enjoy the Town in your Absence from it free from the Plagues that allay the Delights of it here And those Fools and Knaves that are always in our way to perplex us and disturb us here appear at  Southwick  only to give you Joy While the Calamities of Courts and the Follies and Villainies of great Towns set before you recommend the Security the Charms and the Innocence of so sweet a Retreat the more to you While most of the People of great Quality and of great Estates entertain their Neighbours and their Acquaintance either with unprofitable  empty Amusements or with pernicious Diversions which drown their Understandings and debase their Souls you please them with the noble Delights of Reason such as rightly made use of will enlarge their Understandings direct their Wills and exalt their Minds Good God How must they blush who spend great Estates or at least the Incomes of them in turning Men into Beasts while you with all the Oeconomy of Conduct have the Satisfaction of improving Beasts into Men As all Men who are capable of thinking right approve the Judgment of your Choice so we who are passionate Friends to the Stage think it our Duty to return you Thanks for the timing it For at the very time that several Persons of the greatest Quality and the greatest Interest have been endeavouring to banish the Drama from this Town and Island and to introduce instead of it an effeminate Musick to emasculate the Minds of Men to metamorphose the  British  Nation and with Songs like those of the Syrens to change our very Kinds you have generously made Choice of that very Time to appear the great Encourager of the Dramatick Muses and to afford them a Refuge and a Retreat so charming that while they are at  Southwick  they may not regret  Parnassus  So generous a Proceeding  has oblig'd all the hearty Friends to the Stage and has added one more sensible Obligation to those which you have been formerly pleas'd to confer upon  SIR  Your most Humble and most Obedient Servant JOHN DENNIS  London  Aug  To the Right Honourable the Earl of GODOPHIN Lord High Treasurer of GREAT BRITAIN  Concerning the Proposal for the Security of Commerce  My LORD  I Have here the Honour to send Your Lordship the Abstract of that Proposal which I laid before you about the middle of the last Sessions of Parliament I did not think fit to remind Your Lordship of it before because tho' you might have approv'd of it it was then too late for the Parliament to go through it and besides I had some Apprehension that that Parliament would not enter into it  My Lord at present I humbly conceive with all imaginable Submission to your Lordship's Judgment that the bringing this Proposal to Practice would be highly convenient and perhaps necessary absolutely  necessary if the War is like to be of any long continuance and highly convenient though it should be like to have a speedy end Because in this last Case I humbly conceive that we should have a better and more solid Peace than we should have without it For nothing with Submission to your Lordship's Judgment would more alarm the  French  than the reducing this Proposal to Practice For since they have but two ways of succeeding in their Designs against these Nations which are the Dividing us at Home and the ruining our Commerce Abroad they would lose the very Hope of Success if they should see themselves prevented in both to which the bringing this Proposal to Practice would contribute not a little I have been told by so many understanding People that the general Insurance which is a part of this Proposal would bring in such considerable Sums into the  Exchequer  as would make it equivalent to almost any other Tax that I can hardly doubt of it My Lord I humbly conceive that it would have some Advantages above all other Taxes For as far as I am able to make a Judgment upon a four Years scrutiny 'tis a Tax that is very much desir'd even after so long a War and which is remarkable it is most earnestly desir'd by those who are to pay the Money because by this Tax something would be done for them preferably to the  the rest of the People which cannot be said of any other Tax and whereas perhaps by all other Taxes both Trade and the ordinary constant Revenue are considerably diminish'd they would not only be both improv'd and augmented by this but the national Stock encreas'd and the whole Confederacy strengthned and bound indissolubly I shall have the Honour of waiting on your Lordship suddenly to know your Pleasure in this Affair If your Lordship encourages me to lay this Proposal before the House of Commons I shall prepare an Appendix by which I believe I can satisfie that Honourable House that the Advantages mention'd both in the Proposal at large and in the Abstract will really accrue to us from putting that Design in Practice  I am My LORD Your Lordship's  c  June  TO Mr GEORGE SEWEL  On the Preface to a Comedy call'd the MASQUERADE  SIR  I Have lately read over the Preface to a certain comical Rhapsody with an odd mixture of Laughter and Indignation upon which I shall here send you some Remarks that were made in a cursory manner He pretends to turn your own Canon upon you but he has done it to so fine a purpose that it has recoil'd with violence upon himself and quite demolish'd the paltry Works he has rais'd For what confounded Sot will read any thing of an Author who is capable of writing such a Preface Mr  Dryden  tells us in his Preface to the  Medal  that upon his writing  Absalom  and  Achitophel  he met with just such Adversaries What Reflections he makes upon that notable way of proceeding you will find in the  foresaid Preface But to return to that of our Author  He has very little Inclination he says to write Prefaces because I suppose 'tis not so easie to steal Prefaces as Plays However as difficult as 'tis he has brought it about He has boldly seiz'd upon yours and boasts of it as Plunder instead of Theft  He neither commends nor defends the Play which would be to waste his Breath in commending  Shirly  and  Taverner  But he spends his borrow'd Preface in commending the Actors who vouchsaf'd to be the Receivers and Venders of his stolen Goods His  Masquerade  he says owes all his Success to them And here the Panegyrick which others bestow upon some one substantial Patron he is for retailing among a Company of Actors which he distributes among them at so surprising a rate that not a Mortal of them can pretend to any Share of it For first the Success of this Play is owing to the just Performance of the Players in general then 'tis particularly owing to the Grace which with her usual Excellence Mrs  Oldfield  gave to her Part Indeed no one who has had the Happiness to know Mrs  Oldfield  can in the least doubt of her being qualified whenever she pleases to give extraordinary Pleasure by her Parts But now to shew that Fools as well as Children are for Boys Play  this Person the very next Moment resumes the Commendation which he so very generously granted to the Company in general and so very justly to Mrs  Oldfield  in particular and to shew his old Inclination to Arbitrary Power pretends to make a fresh Grant of it for the sole use of Master  Robert Wilks The Success of this Comedy  says he  is owing entirely to Master  Robert Well I have read many a gross fulsome flattering Fool but I never read any one before who was Fool enough to own that he flatter'd grossly and fulsomly For when he tells Mr  Robert Wilks  that the Success of the Play is entirely due to him and in the same Breath tells the whole Company 'tis due to them and in the same Breath tells Mrs  Oldfield  that 'tis very particularly due to her what does he do but laugh in Master  Robert  's Face and tell him that he takes him for the errantest Baby that ever was bit at Bobcherry But now to shew that this Fellow is more Fool than Knave and that he does not flatter on this Occasion so much as he thinks he does and owns that he does I will venture to bring him off a little nay I will venture to shew that when he says the Success of the Play is entirely due to Mr  Robert Wilks  he does not flatter at all For I have heard a grave Bird sing that if it had not been for him alone the  Masquerade  had never  een acted the rest of the Managers having  e last Contempt for it Some of the  layers told a Gentleman of my Acquain  nce that the Cause of this Author's being Master  Robert  's Favourite is because he  oes carry himself like a true Poet to him  o' not to the rest of the World For in  rder to please Master  Robert  and entire  y to gain his Affections he does not fail  om time to time to entertain him with  ertain quaint Inventions with certain in  enious Fictions while Master  Robert    ke other Auditors and Spectators being willing to be deceiv'd in order to be perfect  y pleas'd supposes all this to be true They  dded that Master  Robert  was so exceed  ngly delighted with Entertainments of this  ature that the other Managers paid for  is Pleasure of this kind very dearly it  tanding them in at least five hundred Pounds a Year I shall tell you things when I see you which are not fit to be writ  I am Your  c  Hampstead  March  TO THO SERGEANT  Esq  SIR  I Remember very well that before I went out of Town in  June  last I promis'd in a short time to give you some Account of the late  I make no doubt but that you have long before this time accus'd me of Breach of Promise But if you did but know what charming Places I have been in since I saw you last and what damnable Company for the most part I have kept in them how my Life has been chequer'd between Rapture and Chagrin and consequently unable to turn it self to Business did you but know this I am confident you would not blame me Besides I consider'd that Authors as well as Pettifoggers ought to have long Vacation and that it was but reasonable that the World should once a Year enjoy an Interval from being plagu'd with either that it was highly expedient that Minds sometimes should lye  Fallow as well as Fields as well as those Human Bodies which they inform that they who are too often in the Act of Generation produce but weak and puny Offsprings and peradventure none and that the Scriblers and common Whores of that vile Town seldom beget any thing unless something by Chance that like a  Dutch Sooterkin  is at once frightful and contemptible as all Monsters are Besides I thought it a Duty to my self to recruit those Spirits by a pleasing Indolence which a long Misfortune had almost exhausted And if at any time in spight of these reasonable Reflections I resolv'd to set heartily about the Performance of my Promise I immediately started at the Thought of what I was about to undertake For to make Remarks upon this  Death and Hell a Man must read it And who that has Quails and  Burgundy  before him would leave them for  Porter  and Ram Mutton Besides the Faults in it are so frequent and so gross that every Fool may find them and a Man cannot value himself or expect that the reasonable Part of the World should value him for his Sagacity or Penetration on the account of exposing them I flatter my self that you who have had a fourteen Years Experience of my Sincerity will believe that I speak my Sentiments at least I can assure you  that I have taken all imaginable Care and have kept the most watchful Guard upon my self that I might neither endeavour to deceive you thro' Malice nor be my self deceiv'd thro' Prejudice But since perhaps you or somebody to whom you may shew this Letter may be of another Opinion I shall send you in a Day or two some Observations upon the first which little may be enough to shew all the Beast For a Lyon is not better descry'd by his Claw than an Ass is known by his Ear  I am SIR Your  c  Hanworth  Sept  TO THO SERGEANT  Esq  SIR  I Wrote to you about a Week ago and design'd to write again by the next Post  ut that Raskal  Appius  has lately taken  so much of my Time that he will not  ffer me to be in good Humour enough  entertain my Friends Besides the very House where I am is sanctified to that de  ree that 'tis a mortal Enemy to Gayety  nctified to the very Names of the Persons  ho inhabit it The Name of the elder  on is  Aminadab  of the younger  Amos  of  e elder Daughter  Jemina  of the second  ezia  and of the youngest  KerenHap  ch  which you know are the Names of  he three Daughters of the most patient Man And you may take it on my word  hat Master  Aminadab  and Madam  KerenHappuch  are two very extraordinary Perons  In this House you must know Sir is  old Fanatical Pettifogger who has lately  married a young Wife There being not Room enough to receive her here she lives at present with her Father in a Village about seven Miles off And the old Pettifogger ambles to her in his Gambadoes once a Week to pay his natural Tax And then litterally returns to see his Uncle who is the Master of the House where we lodge It happen'd about a Month ago that some Business obstructed his Journey but having procured a Barrel of Oysters he ordered them with a Letter to be sent in his stead The Letter was delivered to a MarketMan who came from the Village and he was ordered to go to the Stable and to take a Sack which he should find there in which the Oysters it seems were wrapt which he was order'd to deliver to Spouse with the Letter In the mean while as the Devil would have it another Countryman had laid another Sack there which the former Countryman who knew nothing of the Freight took instead of that with the Oysters carried it to the Village and delivered it to Spouse with the Letter which was to this Effect  My Dear  BUsiness will not permit me to be happy in your Embraces Tonight But I intend to be with you on  Monday  In the mean time I have sent you something to supply  my Place with which I hope you will enjoy your self in my Absence  Your  c  Spouse was very well pleas'd with the Letter orders the Sack to be immediately open'd and greedily pulls out of itHalf a dozen Bunches of Carrots And so you have the Piece of rural Waggery which I promis'd you in my last  I am SIR Your  c  Newport  Oct  To Mr * * *  My good Friend  I Who in Town was great as  Caesar    Am here reduc'd to  Nebuchadnezzar  That is I have been for these three Weeks at Grass with meer white Cattle and have not so much as seen three reasonable Creatures since I left the neighbourhood of  Whitehall  When I arriv'd at this Place I had the Mortification to find that of my two Landlords in whose Houses I had here formerly pass'd so many delicious Hours the one was gone to live at  Epsom  and the other was run quite away Upon enquiry I found that there were but two Houses to lodge at a common boarding House or my Barber's I consider'd that by going to the common boarding House I should give up a good part of my Liberty which is the principal Thing that makes the Country so charming For there might be Women at that House or they might come the very Day after me who tho' old and ugly might expect as much Ceremony  as if they were young and beautiful Now that Ceremony which passes hourly among some People is founded like Law on a mutual Agreement between them to give up part of their natural Liberty for the Benefit of Society But tho' there is a sort of Necessity for an Observance of Forms and Ceremonies in great and Capital Towns yet when a Man retires into the Country he is desirous to be for a while at least like the Woods and Hills which he ranges in the State of Na  ure I must consess that even in great Towns I have always had a very indif  erent Opinion of a great deal of Ceremony and have been always apt to beieve that as  ubi plurimae leges pessima  espublica  so where there is the most Ce  emony there is always the worst Soci  ty Another Reason which inclin'd me  the Barber's was a Desire to know  he Nature of this Place For tho' I  ave been ten times here yet as my for  er Lodgings had the finest Meadows  nd Streams in the World behind them  scarce ever came into the Village  that till this last Arrival I knew no  ing of the People of  Cobham  of whom  my next I shall give you some Account  I am Yours  Cobham  ly  TO Dr * * * at  Shrewsbury  Of Ecclesiastical Quacks  SIR  I Return you Thanks for your agreeable Relation of the Progress of the Itinerant Doctor who travels it seems like one of those foolish Fires which lead People into Bogs and Ditches whose Misfortune it is to come in the way of their false and delusive Light Upon the Receipt of your entertaining Letter I made the following Queries to some of his gross Admirers  Whether some People who practice Divinity tho' they are called Doctors are not really Quacks and whether Mountebanks Ecclesiastical as well as Secular are not distinguish'd from true Professors by the following Marks  First  Whether the true Physician both of Soul and Body is distinguish'd from the Mountebank not by wearing an Academical  Bonnet but by Wisdom Learning  nd a long Experience in the Art of Heal  ng and whether he who thro' want of  hese continually mistakes the Distemper of  is Patient and by Consequence admini  ters Poison to him prescribes Opiates in  Lethargy or Brandy in a Calenture is not  ridiculous contemptible Empirick tho'  has been dubb'd both Batchelor and Do  tor at  Oxford    Secondly  Whether the true Physician  oth of Soul and Body does not consult the  aie and design the Health of the whole  ody politick and the whole Body natural  which 'tis his Fortune or Duty to admi  ster Whereas the Quack of both kinds  ever fails like the Tinker to make two  oles while he is emploied in mending of  e For Example the true Physician of  e Body natural purges and cleanses the  hole Mass of Blood in order to the heal  g an Ulcer in the  Pudenda  whereas the  mpirick by giving a sudden Check to it  rows it up into the nobler Parts And  e Spiritual Physician of the Body Poli  ck is for saving every Soul of that Body  which he happens to be a Member  hereas the Ecclesiastical Empirick as if  were the first Plenipo of Heav'n is for  ing some and damning others with an  solute Power  Thirdly  Whether the true Physician does not keep his Station and confine his Practice to his Neighbourhood whereas Folly and Imposture by remaining constantly with the same People would suffer too much thro' too long an Inspection And therefore the Mountebank finds his Account better in being Itinerant And when he has cheated the Fools of one Majoralty both of their Health and their Money seeks for fresh Cullies and fresh Idiots in a new Corporation  Fourthly  Whether the true and the sound Physician is not satisfied with the Approbation of his own Conscience and of those who have common Sense whereas the Mountebank makes it his Business to be the Idol of the Rabble and therefore has much more numerous Aplauders than the true Physician For Rabble is a most comprehensive Word Doctor and includes not only pitiful poor Mechanicks and wretched Rogues in Rags but many nay very many Persons who are distinguish'd by Fortune and dignified by Princes This comprehensive Word Doctor includes all who want Understanding and Virtue And so for Example the Rabble round the  Wrekin  includes not only the Butchers the Tinkers the Weavers and the Tailors of the adjacent Towns and Counties but often likewise too often the Mayor the  Sheriff the Alderman and the Doctor I mean the Mountebank both Spiritual and Secular for every one who seeks the Applause of Rabble is himself most certainly Rabble but how Emphatically Doctor are they Rabble who are the Admirers and the Applauders of Rabble  Thus has your Letter drawn Queries from me instead of an Answer which I hope you will look upon as an Equivalent and read with Candor and with Indulgence as coming from  Your  c  TO HENRY CROMWELL  Esq  Of an Expression in  Shakespear  and of the Comedy of the  Nonjuror  SIR  I Wrote to you this Morning for your more deliberate Opinion concerning the Passage of  Phaedrus  I now send this to you to consult you about an Expression in the  Othello  of  Shakespear  which  long ago occasioned a great Dispute at  CoffeeHouse between the Wits there and the Manager of the PlayHouse who acts the Part of  Othello  The Wits asked the Player how he lik'd this Expression in his own Part  Excellent Wretch  to which the latter answer'd that he lik'd it so ill that he always left it out Upon which they immediately extoll'd it to the Skies and look'd upon the Player with great Contempt Tho' that Tragedian has no more Judgment in Tragedy than an Ass has in Musick I am apt to believe that he was  this once in the right I know indeed very well that  miser  and  misellus  were sometimes among the  Romans  Terms of Tenderness I find that  miser  is in that Sense in the Eunuch of  Terence  Act the third Scene the last where  Chaerea  gives  Antipho  an Account of his enjoying  Pamphila  Ch  Edicit ne vir quisquam ad eam adeat et mihi ne ahscedam imperat  In interiore parte at maneam solus cum solâ Adnuo  Terram intuens modeste  An  Miser  Which Madam  Dacier  has translated  pauvre Garçon  But are there not two sorts of Tenderness a Comick and a Tragick Tenderness Now tho'  miser  was sometimes us'd by the  Romans  to express both the one and the other Tenderness yet in my Opinion it can never be translated into  English  by the Word  Wretch  in any but the Comick way  Wretch  in a serious Sense being always if I am not mistaken a Term of Reproach or Contempt And consequently the Terms  Excellent Wretch  being inconsistent and contradictory make the meaning absurd and the Expression Nonsense This is my Opinion at present but I know not how long it will be so because I have not as yet heard yours  But that is not the only Point in which I desire it I am told lately by one of my  Acquaintance that I have been too severe upon the Understanding of another of the Managers and that is of  Cibber  And the Reason that was given me was that  Cibber  writ  the Fool in Fashion  which says my Friend you have often said is a good Comedy To which I answer that 'tis true I have often said 'tis a good Comedy but I had always much ado to believe that  Cibber  writ it and that since I have seen the  Nonjuror  and the  Heroick Daughter  I do not believe it at all For which I shall give my Reasons and afterwards desire to know from you how convincing they appear to you  When  the Fool in Fashion  was first acted  Cibber  was hardly twenty Years of Age Now could he at the Age of twenty write a Comedy with a just Design distinguished Characters and a proper Dialogue who now at forty treats us with  Hibernian  Sense and  Hibernian English  Could he when he was an arrant Boy draw a good Comedy from his own raw uncultivated Head who is now at forty able to do nothing but what is poor and mean when he is supported by two such Masters as  Moliere  and  Corneille  I have often observ'd to you that there is not in his  Heroick Daughter  one Spark of the Force and noble Spirit of  Corneille  As for  Moliere  I am satisfied that he knows  nothing of him but that he built his  Non  uror  upon some spiritless dull Translation of him When I heard that a Play with  hat Title was to be acted I wish'd it as much Success as  Cibber  did upon account of the Cause in which it was writ But I  efus'd to see it acted because knowing  Moliere  's Play to be a Masterpiece I was  fraid I should be ask'd some Questions by my Friends which I should not care to an  wer I heard an advantagious Character of it from some with whom I conversed  nd what I heard I imparted to others but  coming from my Friends and not from my self After the Play was printed I wou'd not read it till it had been publish'd  Month during which time I was ask'd a hundred Questions about it When I saw that the Curiosity of the World was pretty well over I sent for the Play and read it Upon the reading it I was soon confirm'd in some of my former Thoughts that Persons of a very good Understanding might be impos'd upon at a Representation by the Liveliness and Grace of Action and that the Excellence of the Actor often makes amends for the Imperfections of the Author I soon found that there was little in the  English  Comedy of the Beauties of  Moliere  For  Moliere  's Characters in his  Tartuffe  are Masterpieces mark'd distinguish'd glowing bold touch'd with a fine  yet a daring Hand all of them stamp'd with a double Stamp the one from Art and the other from Nature No Phantoms but real Persons such as Nature produces in all Ages and Custom fashions in ours His Dialogue too is lively natural graceful easie strong adapted to the Occasion adapted to the Characters In short 'tis by this Comedy and by the  Misantrope  that  Moliere  perhaps has born away the Prize of Comedy from all Persons in all Ages except  Ben Johnson  alone But the Characters of the  English  Comedy are most of them daub'd and bungled and the Dialogue nothing but meer Fribble Now is it barely possible that this bungling Imitator can be the Author of  the Fool in Fashion  Is it barely possible that he should have known Mankind and the Stage and the  English  Tongue when he was an errant Boy who is grossly ignorant of them all at forty But  Cibber  's Name is prefix'd to  the Fool in Fashion  They know nothing of Mr  Cibber  who in the least wonder at that He who now he is turn'd of Forty sets his Name without any manner of Scruple or Ceremony to what all the World knows was writ by  Fletcher  and  Dryden  could not his Vanity when he was a Boy prevail upon him to own what an unknown tho' a very ingenious Gentleman writ Thus have I given you my Reasons why I cannot  believe that  The Fool in Fashion  was writ by Mr  Cibber  But I desire to know as I told you above how convincing these Reasons appear to you  I am SIR Your  c  June  TO Mr * * *  SIR  YOU desire me to send you some Arguments to convert your Neighbour from  Jacobitism  who you say is a Man of good Sense and a good Christian and good Protestant I have sent you the following Queries to present to him and am of the Opinion that if he is what you say they may have some Influence on him  I Whether 'tis possible that the Pretender should be settled here without the Subversion of our present Constitution and the Establishment of Absolute Power  II Whether the Establishment of Absolute Power under a Popish Prince will not extirpate the Protestant Religion from  Great Britain  and  Ireland  III Whether the Extirpation of the Protestant Religion from these Islands will not in all Human Appearance be follow'd by the utter Destruction of it throughout the Christian World  IV Whether the Destruction of the Pro  stant Religion throughout the Christian World will not in all human Appearance  followed by the utter Destruction of Christianity it self  V Whether since these Things are  sily prov'd as I my self will undertake to  ove any of the foresaid Consequences  who professes himself a Christian and  Protestant can have the Heart to wish  Conscience to promote a Design which will be the Ruin of that Religion on which  believes that all his Happiness depends  I am  c  ept  TO The Reverend Mr MANSELL  SIR  THE last of  July  I had the Honour to return an Answer to your most obliging and ingenious Letter I have since had the Curiosity to enquire after the Priests whom you mention but have been able to get no Intelligence from which I conclude that the Priests whom you mention must be two or three scandalous  Jacobite  Curates in your Neighbourhood But whatever Ill they may say of me I will presume that they do not call me Fool which implies all other Infamies For as  Rochefoucault  says a Fool has not Stuff enough to be good I will presume they do not say of me that every Word that every Action of my Life is a Contradiction to common Honesty and to common Sense that tho' I am most sordidly interested and most ridiculously proud I am endeavouring with Might and Main to make my self most miserable and most despicable that I am labouring with all my Might and with all my Strength to bring in a Tyrant in  order to secure Liberty and the Pope to secure Religion and my spiritual Property that I desire and endeavour nothing so vehemently as to bring my Wife and Children to Infamy and Beggary and to make of my self either a vile Vagabond or an execrable Apostate and that I have been all along labouring at this so strenuously that I have made my self a most perjur'd Villain in order to bring it about and scandalous enough to bring fresh Disgrace upon a Pillory or the Whippingpost  These Sir are things which I presume they do not say of me because these are Encomiums which are only worthy of them and which they have made upon themselves by their Actions But because what they  say of me they have in all Likelyhood from that Monster  J  S  I desire that in my next you will give me Leave Sir to say a Word concerning that Wretch to shew you how I resented the Prank which he would have plaid me in  Northamtonshire  I took the Will for the Deed and most religiously observed the Law of Retaliation with him upon the very first Opportunity  I am  c  London  Aug  To the Right Honourable the Lord PARKER Lord High Chancellor of GREAT BRITAIN  My LORD  AT a Time when so many Persons are shewing by the Presents they make your Lordship the Veneration which they have for your great Qualities and their Acknowledgments for the Benefits which they receive from them I humbly desire your Lordship to accept of the two Volumes which I here present to you which are no small part of the Labours of thirty Years in the Cause of Liberty and of  Great Britain  In presenting them to your Lordship I have the Satisfaction of offering them to a just and clearsighted Judge of Art as a discerning and righteous one of Equity May your Lordship's Glory and Happiness encrease as your Years are multiplied  that the Glory and Happiness of  Great Britain  may be proportionably augmented with them  I am My LORD Your Lordship's  c  Jan  TO J CHARLTON  Esq  SIR  THE Honour which I formerly had of being personally known to you tho' but a little gives me Encouragement at this time of  New Year's Gifts  to make you a trifling Present of the Books which you will receive with this which are no small Part of the Labour of thirty Years in the Cause of Liberty and of your Country If I should tell you that I send them without any Design I am sure Sir would not believe me I will therefore freely own that I have a Design but 'tis a just and innocent one which will put you to no Expence and but to a very little Trouble I shall beg Pardon for the Trouble when I acquaint you with the Design which will be in a few Days In the mean time Sir Inclination as well as Custom engages me to wish so good and so great a Patriot a long and a happy Life 'Tis the Interest of all the Lovers of their Country that such  you should long be serviceable to it and  wishing for the Happiness of those few who resemble you they certainly wish for their own  I am SIR Your  c  an  Written in the Name and at the Request of WILL PENKETHMAN the Comedian to her Grace the Dutchess of  THE  Humourous Lieutenant  being shortly oblig'd to tread the Stage for the Benefit of your Grace's most humble Servant to whom ought I sooner to have Recourse to encourage it than to your Grace who upon my last Benefit made such an Appearance for me as shew'd your Power to be great as your Goodness or as my Acknowledgments And I make this humble Request to your Grace with the less Despondence of obtaining it because  am assur'd from your noble Nature that I am far from offending you in giving you an Occasion to exert your Beneficence My Success depends in so great a measure upon your Grace's Favour that without it  the Humourous Lieutenant  is like to be a sad Fellow and the Rural Theatre in your Grace's Neighbourhood is  like to give a melancholy Lesson to Mortals of the Instability of Humane Affairs and the short Duration of the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World For that very Fabrick which was metamorphos'd from its original Form and adorn'd for the Entertainment of Nobility Wit and Beauty will relapse and dwindle into a Barn and fodder Cows and Horses  That your Grace may be always both here and hereafter compleatly happy as those blest Beings whom you resemble and whose Examples you imitate is the constant Wish and the zealous Prayer whenever I do happen to pray of  Madam  Your Grace's Most Humble and most Oblig'd Obedient Servant W P  April  TO Sir RICHARD BLACKMORE  On Two Verses in VIRGIL  SIR  I Desir'd in my last that you wou'd be Arbitrator in a Dispute which I lately had with Mr  Rowe  concerning some Verses of  Virgil  The Passage is in the d Eclogue  Malo me Galatea petit lasciva puella  Et fugit ad salices se cupit antè videri  Now Sir Mr  Rowe  affirm'd that the Nymph in acting and the Shepherd in relating meant nothing but Boys and Girls Play My Opinion is that such an Interpretation renders the Passage wholly flat and insipid and fit to please none but Children that the Nymph by throwing the Apple and then running away to the Willows but at the same time taking care that the  Shepherd should see her before she got to them design'd Mans and Womans Play Now Sir you are left to judge which of the Explications is most worthy of  Virgil  and which comes nearest up to that  Molle  and that  Facetum  which at that time of Day compos'd the Character of  Virgil  if we will take the Opinion of a very judicious Critick and that was his Friend  Horace    Molle atque Facetum  Virgilio annuerint gaudentes Rure Camaenae  For where is the  Molle  and the  Facetum  in these Verses if the Nymph and the Shepherd like Boys and Girls were only at hide and seek I could as soon believe that when  Silenus  in the Sixth Eclogue says speaking of  Aegle Huic aliud mercedis erit  he only intended to present her with a Pair of Gloves I know indeed very well that  Ruaeus  interprets  Lasciva  by  Jocosa Puella  But it ought to be consider'd that  Ruaeus  was a Priest and that the Dauphin was young and that it was the Business and Duty of the Jesuit to conceal from his young Pupil the Lubricity of the Poet's meaning Nor is  Lasciva  us'd upon this occasion tho' 'tis taken in the common Sense so very different from  Jocosa Puella  if we consider that  Homer  whenever he has occasion to mention  Venus  calls her the Laughterloving  Goddess Besides my Antagonist does not seem enough to consider either the Nature of Women in general or of the  Italian  Women in particular or of the Season when this was suppos'd to happen which was High Spring which is the Season of High Desire as  Palaemon  gives us to understand a little before this Passage in three Verses the two last of which are beautiful as their Subject  Dicite quandoquidem in molli consedimus herbâ  Et nunc omnis ager nunc omnis parturit arbos  Nunc frondent Sylvae nunc formosissimus annus  Now when we consider all these Things can we believe that  Virgil  who was so judicious so wise and who follow'd Nature so closely meant nothing but  Hide and Seek  by his  se cupit antè videri  That which makes this one of the beautifullest Passages of all the Eclogues is that there is a very wanton Meaning express'd in very modest Words and consequently occasion given to the Reader to shew his Discernment by piercing the Veil which the Poet has thrown over the Nudity which puts me in mind of a fine Passage of  Montaigne Essay Lih    Ch    The Verses of these two Poets  meaning  Lucretius  and  Virgil treating with so much Discretion and so much Reservedness of Lasciviousness as they treat of it do as it were discover more of it and shew it in a better and nearer Light Our Ladies cover their Breasts with a Veil as our Priests do their sacred Things and Painters shadow their finest Draughts in order to give them Lustre They say likewise that the Rays of the Sun and the Strokes of the Mind are more forcible by Reflection than when they come directly It was a wise Answer of the  Aegyptian  to him who ask'd him  What doest thou carry concealed there under thy Cloak I carry it conceal'd thus under my Cloak because thou shouldst not know what it is  But there are certain other things that are concealed only on purpose to be shewn  Ovid  is a great deal more bold but therefore a great deal weaker than the other two And when he says plainly  Et nudam pressi corpus adusque meum  Methinks he makes an errant Capon of me by his barefaced Lewdness He who says all satiates and disgusts us whereas he who expresses himself with Reserve and Caution draws us in to imagine more ev'n than he could have express'd There is as it  were Treachery in this kind of Modesty since it slyly opens so inviting a Path to a wanton Imagination  Thus far  Montaigne  When he speaks of the Modesty of  Lucretius  he means I suppose that Modesty which he shews in his Invocation where indeed in very modest Terms he treats of a very wanton Subject  I could say more upon this Subject but I am afraid that I have already tired you as well as my self  I am  c  Feb  TO WALTER MOYLE  Esq  At  Bake  near  Loo  in  Cornwall  SIR  TWenty tedious Years have now been past since I had the Honour either to see you or hear from you or write to you Tho' I had many a time done the latter if you had not prevented it by your unkind Prohibition when the last time I saw you you declared among a great number of your Friends that you would keep Correspondendence with no one But tho' by reason of that unkind Declaration we have a long time reckoned you dead and buried to the World and us yet we have been far from forgetting you so very far from it that we have had the more lively Remembrance of you because we have seen no body since you left us who by resembling you could put us in mind of you  Which recalls to my mind something that past at the Funeral Ceremonies of a great Lady in the Time of  Tiberius Caesar  The Images of her Ancestors were carried in Procession upon that Occasion but says  Tacitus eo praefulgebant Cassius at que Brutus quod eorum Imagines non visebantur  At length after twenty Years Silence I am oblig'd to write to you in order to do you Service and my self Justice  D  the Printer was with me Yesterday and had the Folly or the Impudence to shew me a Letter from you by which I found that that Scoundrel had arrogated to himself the little Present which I order'd him to make you last  May  was twelvemonth and to make it pass for his own Act and Deed I order'd him to send you the two Volumes which he printed for me before they were published and to send them in the large Paper which he ought to have done for his own Sake because then you wou'd have seen a Book very beautifully printed I ordered him likewise to send them as handsomly bound as the skilfull'st Workman could bind them But upon the bringing in his Account I found that that Wretch who has not Soul enough to do a handsome thing tho' he is sure it will cost him nothing had sent the common Paper without any binding at all  D  had as much forgot you before I mentioned you to him as if he had never known you unless by Sight and by Chance But upon his enquiring whose the Anonymous Letters were which were printed  one of the two Volumes I said enough to him of the Author and of the Expectation which I had of the Translation of  Dionysius Halicarnassaeus  to fire his dull Mass with the greedy desire of Gain  I am interrupted but I shall the very  ext Post without fail say something to you of that Translation and of the Pre  ace which is got into the Hands of a  riend of your Brother's and mine who I hope and believe has too much Ho  our ever to print it without your Con  ent I am oblig'd to take my leave of  ou till the next Post In the mean time  desire you to judge of the Respect the Esteem and Affection which I have and  ave always had for you since I had first  he Honour to know you by what I am  oing to tell you that for twenty Years  ogether I have never so much as once  en any of our common Acquaintance without mentioning you in such a man  er as shew'd that I very sensibly regret  ed your leaving us Sir George  Mark  am  can tell you something of this and  can Mr  Congreve  Mr  ein  and Mr  Welbye  But most of the rest alas are vanish'd like a Morning's Dream  I am SIR Your most Humble and Faithful Servant JOHN DENNIS  London  Jan  TO THO SERGEANT  Esq  SIR  I Have been not a little concern'd at my not being able to keep Touch with my Appointment to Day But  multa cadunt  nter calicem supremaque Labra  Many things have fallen out between my Lips and the Cups of Punch which I design'd to drink with my Friend Mr  Sergeant  to Day My only Associates in this Place are the same that the ingenious  Don Quixote  had at the famous  La Manche viz  the Barber and the Curate Now the Disappointment that I had from the former and the too great Punctuality of the latter have been the Occasion of my Misfortune For the Barber who should have come on  Saturday  at Three came not till  Sunday  at Eleven so that there was a Necessity of dining before I went After Dinner in comes the Curate and invites me to take part of an Ecclesiastical Collation in the Afternoon  Now Gentlemen of his Complexion are so hearty and so frank in their spiritual Hospitality that if you do not comply with their pressing Invitations you disoblige them for ever The Sorrow which oppress'd me for being disappointed of the Conversation of a Gentleman whom I esteem so much has been in some measure alleviated by the following Considerations First the Author whom I have at present under Consideration has serv'd me as he deserves to be us'd himself and has nail'd my Ears to his Book so fast that I could not without Pain unclinch my self The second Alleviation is the Consideration of my Health For though the Goddess smiles upon me here she has as great an Aversion to old  Sodom  as  Hugh Clodpate  of merry Memory and might for ought I know shake Hands with me at my Entrance into that damn'd Town I begin to be quite another thing than I was while I staid in the Tower and there is as much difference between me on my Hill here and me in my Den at  John Richardson  's as there is between a Lyon on a Mountain in  Africa  and one near the  SpurGuard  Another Comfort that I had was the extraordinary Beauty of the Day For it far'd between me and the Day without Vanity be it spoken as it does between a Pimp and a Lady whom he has in  his Power If she is but tolerably handsome he gives her to his Friend but if she is charmingly fair he is willing to enjoy her himself  This is the third Letter which I have writ to you since I heard from you I hope the other two came to your Hands I desire that you would have the Goodness to send me word in what Posture my Affairs are I shall be unwilling to see the Town till the latter end of this Week unless there is a Necessity for it  I am SIR Your  c  Jan at Night  To H  C  Esq  Of Simplicity in Poetical Compositions in Remarks on the th  Spectator  SIR  BY your last of the th you desire to know my Opinion of the notable Critick upon  Chevy Chase  in the  Spectator  of the st and that of the th of this Instant that is you desire to know whether I believe the Author of those two Papers to be in Jest or in Earnest To which I answer that he is neither in Jest nor in Earnest not in Earnest because he does not believe what he says nor in Jest because he does strenuously endeavour to convince the Reader of the Excellence of that old Dogrel His Design is to see how far he can lead his Reader by the Nose To give my Reasons for this Opinion I shall send you an Examen of those two  Spectators  in as little Compass as I can  When I travelled  says he  I took a particular Delight in hearing the Songs and  Fables that are come from Father to Son and are most in Vogue among the common People of the Countries thro' which I passed for it is impossible that any thing should be universally tasted and approved by a Multitude tho' they are only the Rabble of a Nation which hath not in it some peculiar Aptness to please and gratify the Mind of Man  Now is there any thing that has the least Air of a Jest On the other side do you think that the Author could be capable of meaning and thinking what he pretends to affirm here Is it not plain by the last Words which I have quoted  viz the Mind of Man  that he intended a Fallacy For to affirm this of the Mind of Man as 'tis cultivated and instructed is not only absurd and ridiculous but contradictory of himself Has not he himself observed in the th  Tatter  that there are Exercises and Diversions which universally please the Rabble which yet Men of Quality or Education either despise or abhor Such are the  ShroveTuesday  and  BearGarden  Diversions which he there particularizes I have known a Country Fidler who has been the Delight of three Counties tho' he could never play the Truth of one Tune and a SignPost Painter who has been the Admiration not only of the Rabble but even of most of the Squires of the North of  England  I appeal to the Booksellers who in this Case ought to be Judges without Appeal whether more of the common People do not approve of  Quarles  and  Bunyan  than esteem  Chevy Chase  Therefore 'tis plain that Author could not design that the Period abovementioned should run thus  For 'tis impossible that any thing should be universally tasted and approved of by a Multitude tho' they are only the Rabble of a Nation which has not in it some peculiar Aptness to please and gratify the Minds of Men of Quality and Education  And less can he design to make it run as follows  For it is impossible that any thing should be universally tasted and approv'd of by a Multitude tho' they are only the Rabble of a Nation which has not in it some peculiar aptness to please and gratify the Minds of the Rabble  For to mean this would make not only what he says but what he is a Jest So that the Author by  the Mind of Man  meaning neither the Mind of Man as it is rude and untaught nor the Mind of Man as 'tis cultivated and instructed can mean nothing in the World but to try how far he can impose upon his Reader But he goes on  Human Nature is the same in all reasonable Creatures and whatever falls in with it will meet with Admirers among Readers of all Qualities and Conditions  Moliere  as we are told by  Boileau  us'd  to read all his Comedies to a little old Woman who was his HouseKeeper as she sate at her Work by the Chimney Corner and could foretel the Success of his Play in his Theatre from the Reception it met at the Fire Side For he tells us the Audience always follow'd the old Woman and never failed to laugh in the same Place  Now can you Sir or any Man of good Sense believe that the Author does not know better what belongs to a Jest than to take false Reasoning for one and that he does not know better what belongs to false Reasoning than to mean what he says here Can he be so dull and so absurd as not to know how to distinguish between what Human Nature is and what Human Nature should be Human Nature was Human Nature before the Fall and 'tis Human Nature now 'tis degenerated from that perfect Virtue and that unclouded Knowledge which it enjoy'd before 'Tis the Business and Design of Education to endeavour to retrieve in some measure the Loss that Human Nature has sustain'd by the Fall and to recover some Measure of Knowledge and Virtue Now Heroick Poetry is an Imitation of Human Nature exalted and Comedy is an Imitation of Human Nature depraved What can be more absurd than to conclude that because the Rabble that is such as never had any Education are tolerable Judges of Human Nature depraved that therefore  they are Judges of Human Nature exalted of which none can be Judges but they who have had the best Education And therefore not only the Rabble but an universal Nation has been mistaken in their Judgments of Poets and Poetry when the Judgments have been made before that Nation came to be sufficiently cultivated  Rectè necne crocum floresque perambulet Attae  Fabula sidubitem clament periisse pudorem  Cuncti penè patres ea quum reprehendere coner  Quae gravis Aesopus quae doctus Roscius egit  Vel quia nil rectum nisi quod placuit sibi ducunt  Vel quia turpe putant parere minoribus quae  Imberbes didicere senes perdenda fateri  Hor Ep L  So that we see it was the Opinion of  Horace  that the People of Quality were sometimes mistaken as well as the Rabble nay that both Rabble and People of Quality were sometimes mistaken ev'n in their Judgments of Comedy  At nostri proavi Plantinos numeros  Laudavere sales nimium patienter utrumque  Ne dicam stultè mirati si modò ego vos  Scimus inurbanum lepido seponere dicto  Legitimumque sonum digitis callemus aure  Horat de Arte Po  And to shew you that 'tis impossible the  Spectator  can mean what he says here  Horace  declares in the very Verse which the  Spectator  has chosen for the Motto of his Paper that the Multitude is as often mistaken as it is in the Right  Interdum Vulgus rectum videt est ubi peccat  And he says particularly that they are often mistaken in their Judgments of Verses which have been writ by their Forefathers  Si veteres ita miratur laudatque poetas  Ut nihil anteferat nihilillis comparet errat  Si quaedam nimis antiquè si pleraque durè  Dicere credit eos ignave multa fatetur  Et sapit mecum facit Jove judicat aequo  Now is not here a Motto very judiciously chosen For from these Verses of  Horace  we may justly make this Observation that a Man by his real Approbation and Impertinent Commendation of superannuated Rhimes not only puts himself upon an equal Foot with the Rabble but ev'n of the  most injudicious and foolish part of the Rabble  In fine  Horace  was so far from being of Opinion that the universal Approbation of the Multitude was the Taste and Touchstone of good Poetry that in the last Satyr of his first Book he advises the Poet of his Formation to take no manner of Care about pleasing them  Neque Te ut miretur turba labores  Contentus paucis lectoribus  Now this Advice of  Horace  must either be impertinent and wrong or the Approbation of the Multitude is a Sign of an ill Poem But 'tis time to see how this judicious Author goes on  I know nothing that more shews the essential and inherent Perfection of Simplicity of Thought above that which I call the  Gothick  manner in writing than this that the first pleases all kinds of Palates and the latter only such as have formed to themselves a wrong artificial Taste upon little fanciful Authors and Writers of Epigrams  Homer    Virgil  or  Milton  so far as the Language of their Poems is understood will please a Reader of plain common Sense that would neither relish nor comprehend an Epigram of  Martial  or a Poem of  Cowley  so on the contrary an ordinary  Song or Ballad that is the Delight of the common People cannot fail to please all such Readers as are not unqualified for the Entertainment by their Affectation or their Ignorance and the Reason is plain because the same Paintings of Nature which recommend it to the most ordinary Reader will appear beautiful to the most refin'd  Now Sir can any thing be more plain than that the  Spectator  here cannot mean what he says Because 'tis impossible for a Man of common Sense much less for one of his notable Parts to be guilty of so many Absurdities as there are in this little Paragraph I will make no Objection at present about the  Gothick  Taste I think I have call'd it somewhere so my self tho' tis certain that the pointed conceited way of Wit was in Fashion long before the  Goths  were either a Name or a Nation For you find it not only in  Florus  in  Martial  in  Seneca  in  Tacitus  but even in some of the Writers of  Augustus Caesar  's Age as  Ovid  and  Paterculus  But here are more Important Errors to be taken Notice of For first the  Spectator  would make us believe that all People are Judges of Simplicity of Thought and that the Rabble are better Judges of it than they who have had a generous Education That more People comprehend the Excellency of  Homer  and  Virgil  and  Milton  than the Beauties of  Martial  and  Cowley  tho' perhaps there are not ten Persons living who know all the Merit of  Virgil  and  Milton  's  Paradise Lost  had been printed forty Years before it was known to the greatest Part of  England  that there barely was such a Book He would further insinuate that all those Songs or Ballads which are the delight of the Rabble cannot fail to please all such Readers as are not unqualified for the Entertainment by their Affectation or their Ignorance as if Men of Education in  Great Britain  were more ignorant than the Rabble or it requir'd an extraordinary Stock of Knowledge to comprehend the Excellence of old Dogrel The Reason which he gives for this and which he says is plain is because the same Paintings of Nature which recommend it to the most ordinary Reader will appear beautiful to the most refin'd as if some faint and imperfect Touches of Nature might not recommend a thing to those by reason of their Ignorance or their Stupidity know not how far an Author ought to go in such a Case to express the Truth of Nature which faint and imperfect Strokes would by no means satisfy those who are able to judge of that Truth  Sir the  Spectator  imagines here that there is nothing contrary to Simplicity of Thought but that pointed conceited way  of writing which we mention'd above whereas Simplicity of Thought is Thought which naturally arises from the Subject Ideas which bear a just Proportion to the Things they represent and which the Subject seems of it self as it were to offer to us instead of our obtruding them upon that If we truly consider what Simplicity of Thought in Poetry is we shall find that there are three things which are equally distant from it and those are Imbecility Affectation and Extravagance Imbecility when a Man wants Force to come up to the Truth of Nature Affectation when a Man goes beside it thro' Error Luxury and Wantonness of Soul and Extravagance when a Man goes beyond it thro' a false and  lltim'd Effort to shew his Strength and Excellence We shall find too that Simplicity of Thought is not sufficient to make what we call Metre Poetry that there must be likewise a Simplicity of Expression that a Simplicity of Expression is an Expression which is according to Nature that is an Expression proportion'd to the Ideas as they are to the Things and that consequently then the Expression in great Subjects and in great Thoughts is simple when it is passionate figurative sounding and harmonious and that an Author who in great Subjects and in great Thoughts shews an Expression which comes short of this  shews not a Simplicity but an Imbecility of Expression In short as all the Heroick Virtues are compatible with Simplicity of Heart so all the Magnificence of the most pompous Eloquence is on some Occasions consistent with Simplicity of Style But now let us see a little how the  Spectator  goes on  The old Song of  Chevy Chase    says he  is the favourite Ballad of the common People of  England  and  Ben Johnson  us'd to say he had rather have been the Author of it than of all his Works Sir  Philip Sidney  in his Discourse of Poetry speaks of it in the following Words I never heard the old Song of  Piercy  and  Douglas  that I found not my Heart more mov'd than with a Trumpet and yet it was sung by some blind Crowder with a Voice as rough as his Style which being so evil apparrelled in the Dust aad Cobweb of that uncivil Age what would it work trimm'd in the gorgeous Eloquence of  Pindar  For my own part  says the  Spectator  I am so professed an Admirer of this antiquated Song that I shall give my Reader a Critick upon it without any further Apology for so doing  Now Sir as I shew'd you before by his Sophistry that the  Spectator  is not in earnest so here it may appear by the Authorities he brings that he is not in Jest I am  so very well convinced of the solid Judgment of  Ben Johnson  that if  Ben  ever talk'd at that rate which I will not absoutely pretend to deny tho' I very much doubt it he only did it to laugh and to ridicule some of the sottish Admirers of that obsolete Song As for Sir  Philip Sidney  do but observe the Expression which that noble Gentleman uses he tells us not that his Heart was moved by the Song of  Piercy  and  Douglas  as often as he read it or heard it read but as often as he heard  sung nay tho' it was sung by an old Crowder I shrewdly suspect that there were some martial Notes in this old  Gothick  Tune which very much contributed to the working that Effect upon Sir  Philip Sidney  But instead of affirming that Sir  Philip Sidney  has gone too far he pre  nds to insinuate that he falls too short for the  Spectator  vindicates the very Expres  ion of  Chevy Chase  in which one thing I ust confess he does seem to me to come something near to a Jest and to make a  ne ironical Ridicule upon Sir  Philip Sidney  But be these things as they will besides that thro' the whole Course of this Criticism I have and shall oppose greater Authorities to these I shall confound them by invincible Reason before which no Authority could ever stand and by shewing he Nature of Poetry and what it is that  constitutes the Difference between that and Prose shall make it appear that the Writer of this old Song in spight of the Applause of so many Ages never knew what Poetry was In order to which let us give very near the same Account of it that we formerly did in the  Grounds of Criticism in Poetry  Poetry then is an Art by which a Poet excites Passion and to that very end entertains Sense by a bold and figurative Language and by measur'd harmonious Periods in order to satisfy and improve to delight and reform the Mind and so to make Mankind happier and better  Poetry therefore is Poetry because 'tis more passionate and sensual than Prose A Poet has two ways of exciting Passion The one by the Figurativeness and the other by the Harmony of his Expression but the Figures contribute more to the exciting of Passion than Harmony A Discourse that is writ in smooth and tolerable Numbers if 'tis not figurative can be but measur'd Prose but a Discourse that is every where bold and figurative and consequently every where extremely pathetick is certainly Poetry without Numbers Beside  this alone is a convincing Proof that a Fi…gurative Expression is more essential  Poetry than Harmony  viz  that Harmony  self if 'tis any thing perfect depends up+on  a figurative Expression there being no Example among the Antients themselves of a Ravishing Poetical Musick without figurative Language But as the Language of Poetry in general is to be bold and figurative the Language of great and exalted Poetry is to be very bold and figurative The Doctrine of  Horace  is exactly answerable to this  Primum ego me illorum dederim quibus esse poetas  Excerpam numero neque enim concludere versum  Dixeris esse satis neque siquis scribat utinos  Sermoni propiora putes hunc esse poetam  Ingenium cuisit cuimens divinior atque os  Magna sonaturumi des nominis hujus honorem  Idcirco quidam Comaedia necne poema  Esset quaesivere quodacer spiritus ac vis  Nec verbis nec rebus inest nisi quod pede certo  Differt sermoni sermo merus  For he tells us here three things in a very conspicuous manner First that poetical Measures are not sufficient to constitute a Man a Poet  Neque enim concludere versum  Dixeris esse satis  Secondly that there must be great Passion and a bold and a figurative Language nay very bold and very figurative  Ingenium cui sit cui mens divinior atque os  Magna sonaturum des nominis bujus honorem  And Thirdly That it was to be questioned whether any thing but the great and exalted Poetry was properly Poetry  Idcirco quidam Comaedia necne poema  Esset quaesivere quod acer Spiritus ac vis  Nec verbis nec rebus inest  Boileau  is exactly of the same Opinion and has in his Ninth Satyr as it were interpreted part of this Passage of  Horace  Mais Repondez un peu qu'elle verve indiscrete  Sans l'aveu des neuf soeurs vous a rendu Poete  Senties vous dites moy ces violens transports  Qui d un Esprit Divin font mouvoir les ressorts  And in his Eighth Reflection upon  Longinus  he tells us plainly that Monsieur  Perrault  having translated the beginning  of the first Ode of  Pindar  without Figures has translated it without Poetry  Rapin  is exactly of the same Mind in his Twenty Ninth Reflection upon Poetry in general For having told us that  Virgil  in  he Fourth of his Georgicks speaks of the Bees every where in the metaphorical Terms of Court Legions Armies Combats Fields of Battel Kings Captains Soldiers that by this figurative and lofty manner he may exalt the Lowness of his Mat  er he adds  C'est ainsi qu'un grand Ouvrier comme Virgile ne dit presque rien dans le propre c'est en quoy consiste le grand art de la Poesie de dire Figurement presque tout ce  u'elle dit Car d' ordinaire les Figures  urnissent des plus grands images que les  hoses mêmes Enfin le Poete doit scavoir  toutes choses ce que l' Eloquence a d' art de methode pour les Figures Ce n'est  ue par les Figures qu'il donne de la Force  ux Passions de l' eclat aux Discours du  ids aux Raisons de l' agreement a tout  qu'il dit Et ce n'est que par les Figures  plus vives de l' Eloquence que tous les  ovemens de l' ame deviennent ardens  assionnez  Which is in  English  thus  Thus a great Master like  Virgil  scarce  ys any thing in plain Language and the  reat Art of Poetry consists in saying almost every thing that is said figuratively  For the Figures generally supply us with Images greater than the Things themselves In short a Poet ought to be possessed of all that Art and that Method in which Eloquence is design'd to instruct us with regard to the Figures They are the Figures that enable him to give Force to the Passions Brightness to the Diction and to the Periods Weight to his Arguments and Charms to all that he says And 'tis only by the liveliest Figures of Eloquence that all the Motions of the Soul become ardent and pathetick  As for Simplicity of which the  Spectator  boasts so much the foresaid  Rapin  has remarkably told us in his Twenty Seventh Reflection that the Simplicity of Thought and even Simplicity of Expression in great Subjects is not incompatible with the greatest Pomp and Magnificence For Simplicity of Thought and Simplicity of Expression is nothing but such Thought and such Expression as Nature in such and such Cases voluntarily suggests and dictates to us  La Troisieme qualité de la Diction  says  Rapin est qu'elle soit naturelle sans affectations selon les Regles de la Biensance du bon sens Les Phrases trop etudiées un Style trop fleury les Manieres trop compassées les Beaux mots les termes trop recherchées toutes les Expressions extraordinaries sont insupportable a la veritable Poesie La seule Simplicité luy convient  pourv  qu'elle sait soutenue de noblesse le grandeur maiscette simplicité n'est con  ue que des grandes ames C'est le chef l' oeuvre de la Poesie le caractere de Homere de Virgile Les ignorans y cherchent de l' Esprit des Beaux Sentimens parce qu'ils sont ignorans La Diction doit etre relevée eclatante c'est sa quatrieme qualité Car tout ce qui est com  un ordinaire dans les Termes ne luy  pas propre Il faut des paroles qui  ayent rien de Bas de Vulgaire une Diction noble magnifique des expressions artes des couleurs vives des traits har dis  fin il faut un Discours qui puisse ega  r la grandeur des Idées d'un Ouvrier qui  it etre le Createur de son ouvrage La  nquieme qualité de la Diction est d'etre  mbreuse pour soutenir cet air grand Majesteux dont se sert la poesie pour  primer toute la Force toute la Dignité  es grandes choses qu' elle dit Il ne luy  ut que des Termes propres a Remplir la  ouche a contenter les oreilles pour  enir a ce merveilleux qu'elle recherche en  utes choses Mais ce n'est pas assez qu'il  a de la grandeur de la magnificence  ans l' Expression il doit y avoir aussi de  Chaleur de la Vehemence il faut  r tout qu'il regne dans les Discours un  rtain Air de Grace de Delicatesse qui  fasse le principal ornement la Beauté  la plus universelle  Which most remarkable Passage is render'd thus  The Third Quality of the Diction is that it ought to be natural without any manner of Affectation according to the Rules of Decorum and of good Sense Phrases that appear too much studied a Style that is too florid a Manner that is too nicely wrought Things that are finely said Terms that are too far fetch'd and all Expressions that are windy and swell Use are insupportable to the true Poetry Only Simplicity can agree with it provided that Simplicity be sustain'd by Nobility and by Greatness But that is a Simplicity with which only great Souls are acquainted 'Tis the Masterwork of Poetry and the Character of  Homer  and  Virgil  The Ignorant look for what they call Wit and fine Thoughts because they are ignorant The fourth Quality of the Diction is that it be exalted and sonorous For every thing that is vulgar in the Expression is below it It requires Words which have nothing that is base and common in them a Diction that is noble and magnificent Expressions that are strong and Colours that are lively and daring and audacious Strokes It requires to say all a Discourse that is able to come up to the Greatness of that Workman's Ideas who ought to be the Maker and Creator of his own Works The fifth  Quality of the Diction is that it be harmonious that it may maintain that great and majestick Air with which Poetry is wont to adorn it self and may express all the Force and the utmost Dignity of the great Things which it utters It ought to reject all Terms but those that are proper to fill the Mouth and content the Ear that it may attain to that Sublime and that Wonderful which it always and every where aims at But 'tis not sufficient that there be Greatness and Magnificence in the Expression there ought to be likewise Ardor and Vehemence and there ought especially to reign throughout the Discourse a fine a graceful and a delicate Air which ought to appear its principal Ornament and its most universal Beauty  Now what one of these great Qualities has the old Ballad of  Chevy Chase  Of all the Lines which the Captain has quoted 'tis remarkable that there is but one which has any thing like a Figure in it Now tho' the Subject of that Song is noble yet there being nothing figurative in it 'tis plain by consequence that there is nothing great nothing noble in it no Magnificence no Vehemence no Painting no Poetry To compare any of the Passages in it to  Virgil  is ridiculous and a Man may as well compare a dead Man to a living For Example  what manner of Comparison is there between these two Passages  The Hounds ran swiftly thro' the Wood  The nimble Deer to take  And with their Cries the Hills and Dales  An Eccho shrill did make  And that of  Virgil    vocat ingenti clamore Cithaeron  Taygetique canes Domitrixque Epidaurus equorum  Et vox assensu nemorum ingeminata remugit  What is there in the first but what is vile and trivial What Ploughman what Tinker what Trull is not capable of saying the like But that of  Virgil  where he gives Voice to the Mountains and Voice Consent and Soul to the Words is so bold so figurative so pompous so harmonious that a Man must be  Virgil  himself to say it What can be more ridiculous nay more monstrous than to find any thing resembling in the following abominable Dogrel  Sir  Charles Martell  of  Ratcliffe  too  His Sister's Son was he  Sir  David Lamb  so well esteem'd  Yet saved could not be  And the following Verses of  Virgil    Cadit Ripheus justissimus unus  Qui fuit in Teucris servantissimus Aequi  Diis aliter visum  Where the divine Harmony is the Result of uncommon Passion and productive of no vulgar Passion Thus we see that in spight of the pretended Resemblance the old Dogrel is contemptible and  Virgil  is incomparable and inimitable One might with a great deal more Justice pretend that there is a Resemblance between the th Psalm of  Sternhold  and that admirable Hymn of  Milton  in the Fifth Book of  Paradise Lost  And yet we need only transcribe them both and place them together here to convince the Reader that the one is bald and vile and wretched and the other great and exalted Poetry Let us begin with the Psalm of  Sternhold  Give laud unto the Lord  From Heav'n that is so high  Praise him in Deed and Word  Above the starry Sky  And also ye  His Angels all  Armies Royal  Praise joyfully  Praise Him both Sun and Moon  Which are so clear and bright  The same of you be done  Ye glittering Stars of Night  And ye no less  Ye Heav'ns fair  And Clouds o' th' Air  His Laud express  For at his Word they were  All formed as we see  At his Voice did appear  All things in their Degree  Which he set fast  To them he made  A Law and Trade  Alway to last  Extol and praise God's Name  On Earth ye Dragons fell  All Deeps do ye the same  For it becomes ye well  Him magnify  Fire Hail Ice Snow  And Storms that blow  At his Decree  The Hills and Mountains all  And Trees that fruitful are  The Cedars great and tall  His worthy Praise declare  Beasts and Cattel  Yea Birds flying  And Worms creepiug  That on Earth dwell  Thus have we laid before the Reader the contemptible Dogrel of  Hopkins  a Version which is despicable Dogrel in spight of its being figurative For every Line here is a different Apostrophe But these are Figures which are another Person's which the Transverser repeats like a Parrot without understanding them and without being mov'd by them and which consequently have neither Passion nor Sublimity to sustain them For 'tis a just Observation which is made by  Longinus  that as the Figures support the pathetick and the sublime they are wonderfully supported by each of them Let us now see how the Force of  Milton  's Genius hides and conceals the Assistance of Art while these lofty Figures at the very time that they raise and transport his exalted Soul are lost in his Enthusiasm and his Sublimity as the glittering of numberless Stars is swallow'd and lost in the blaze of Day and that golden Deluge of Light which on every side overwhelms them The following Hymn is spoken by our first Parents in the Morning at what time they first come out of the Bower in  Paradise  and survey the Works of God which the springing Day has restor'd to them  These are thy glorious Works parent of Good  Almighty Thine this universal Frame  Thus wondrous Fair Thy self how wondrous then  Unspeakable who sit'st above these Heav'ns  To us invisible or dimly seen  In these thy lowest works yet these declare  Thy Goodness beyond thought and pow'r divine  Speak ye who best can tell ye Sons of Light  Angels for ye behold him and with Songs  And Choral Symphonies day without night  Circle his Throne Rejoycing ye in Heav'n  On Earth joyn all ye Creatures to extol  Him first Him last Him midst and without End  Fairest of Stars last in the Train of Night  If better Thou belong not to the Dawn  Sure pledge of Day that crownst the smiling Morn  With thy bright Circlet praise him in thy Sphere  While Day arises that sweet Hour of prime  Thou Sun of this great World both Eye and Soul  Acknowledge Him thy Greater sound his Praise  In thy eternal Course both when thou climbest  And when high Noon hast gain'd and when thou fall'st  Moon that now meet'st the orient Sun now flee'st  With the fix'd Stars fix'd in their Orb that flies  And ye five other wand'ring Fires that move  In mystick Dance not without Song resound  His Praise who out of Darkness call'd up Light  Air and ye Elements the eldest Birth  Of Nature's Womb that in Quaternion run  Perpetual circle multiform and mix  And nourish all things let your ceaseless Change  Vary to our great Maker still new Praise  Ye Mists and Exhalatious that now rise  From Hill or steaming Lake duskie or grey  Till the Sun paint your fleecy Skirts with Gold  In Honour to the World's great Author rise  Whether to deck with Clouds th' uncolour'd Skie  Or wet the thirsty Earth with falling Showers  Rising and falling still advance his praise  His praise ye Winds that from four Quarters blow  Breath soft or loud and wave your Tops ye Pines  With ev'ry Plant in sign of Worship wave  Fountains and ye that warble as ye flow  Melodious Murmurs warbling tune his Praise  Joy  Voices all ye living Souls ye Birds  That singing up to Heav'ns Gates ascend  Bear on your Wings and in your Notes his Praise  Ye that in Waters glide and ye that walk  The Earth and stately tread or lowly creep  Witness if I be silent Morn or Even  To Hill or Valley Fountain or fresh Shades  Made vocal by my Song and taught his praise  Hail universal Lord be bounteous still  To give us only Good and if the Night  Has gather'd ought of evil or conceal'd  Disperse it as now Light dispels the Dark  Now I think nothing can be more plain than that notwithstanding the same Psalm of  David  is the groundwork both of  Milton  and  Sternhold  and notwithstanding a vain Appearance which may delude those who are not able to distinguish there is no more Resemblance between the Hymn of  Milton  and the Version of  Sternhold  than there is between Light and Darkness Heat and Cold Life and Death Heaven and Earth the Graces and Deformity no notwithstanding they both make use of the very same Figures but those Figures in  Sternhold  are dead and he himself seems dead and while he pretends to give Life and Soul and Thought and Spirit and Motion even to the insensible and inanimated Parts of the Universe he is himself without Spirit or Life or Soul or  Thought or Motion while  Milton  's matchless Genius animating the several Figures appears to give Life and Soul and Motion to their several Objects and seems to equal these several mighty Objects in their distinguishing Qualities to be lofty as the Heav'n and solid as the Earth firey as the Sun and changing as the Moon swift as the Winds and strong and terrible and sonorous as the Arms and Mouths of the great Deep Since then there is no manner of Resemblance between the Hymn and the Version which seem to have several things in common what Shadow of Likeness can there be between  Virgil  and  English  Dogrel where there is nothing common between them nor Groundwork nor Figure nor Harmony the Dogrel being utterly destitute both of Figure and Harmony and consequently void of the great Qualities which distinguish Poetry from Prose  I am Your  c  TO The Master of the REVELS  Writ upon the first acting of

Never say they was the Stage prostituted to so vile a degree before It has more than once been accus'd of promoting Vice but was never tax'd till now with encouraging Villany And is the Man say they who is set over it to restrain it from encouraging Vice is he become instrumental in its promoting Villany and such Villany such a Complication of contemptible Folly and of dreadful abominable Wickedness as was never beheld upon any Stage before Good God say they was any thing wanting to the Extravagance of this  degenerate Age but the making a Tarpawlin and a Swabber and a living Tarpawlin and a Swabber the Hero of a Tragedy who at the same time that he is strutting in Buskins here is lolling at  Madagascar  with some drunken sunburnt Whore over a Can of Flip The greatest Rogue and the most detestable Villain that ever the Sun or Moon beheld banish'd not only from his own but from all Countries declar'd the Pest of all Human Society and pursued to Death as a devoted Creature odious and noxious to Mankind the Stage of whose Tragedy if he is caught in  England  will undoubtedly be at  Wapping  Men of common Sense are in Amazement and  fting up their Hands and their Eyes ex  aim what could this judicious Author  ean by introducing upon the Stage a Hero of  ExecutionDock  unless that a Character might be shewn which should be  ought adequate to the Player and that  e Heroe of a Tragedy might at length  produced which might be acted to the  ery Life And this Rogue is christen'd  rsooth  the Successful Pyrate  But sure  y they this pious Christian had most Pa  Godfathers For is not this Name say  ey a Name of notable Instruction and of  e Morality Does it not speak plainly to  following Purpose Men Brethren  Children if any of you have a mind  to push on your Fortunes or supply your Luxuries by such vigorous Methods as Fools call wicked and violent begin to be Rogues and prosper We will encourage you to go on and to dispel the idle and vain Fears of Providence and Divine Vengeance by shewing a greater Rogue than any of you can pretend to be and shewing him prosperous and successful And we here declare upon our Honours that if any of you Gentlemen of the Galleries have a mind to turn Robbers upon the high Seas to plunder our Ships and to fill our Jayls with our Merchants and our Hospitals with their Wives and Children we here declare that if he succeeds rather than that fortunate Rogue should not be celebrated we will not only act him but write him our selves according to the best of  damnable Talents This say the Per…sons mention'd above is the blessed Mo+ral of this Play which must needs  wonderfully agreeable to a civiliz'd  a trading People As I said at first  thought it my Duty to acquaint y  with this  I am SIR Your  c  TO THO SERGEANT  Esq  Sent with a  Cicero  which I had borrow'd of him in a very small Print  SIR  I Here send you back your  Cicero  as I would return a Friend's Mistress to him who had entrusted me with her untouch'd tho' much desir'd and tho' very willing That I have an extream Passion for  Cicero  is but Truth but if I should say of him as a Spark did of a fair Lady that I love him more than my Eyes which made me love him that would be Hyperbolical Being willing then to preserve my Eyes for all my Friends for my mortal Friends in Cloth and Drugget and Silk and Crape and Linsey Woolsey and for my immortal Friends in Leather and for  Cicero  among the rest tho' last not least belov'd I here return him to you and desire you to deliver Sir  John Marsham  into the Hands of  the Bearer That is indeed as the Fable has it to lay the Body of dead  Sphinx  upon an Ass But the Knight was a sort of an Antiquary and an Ass you know was a Beast respected by Antiquity  I am SIR Your  c  Tower  Feb  TO Mr * * *  SIR  I Am not able to give you the Directions you desire to find Mr  B  R  nor have I seen him lately nor will I ever see him more if I can help it I hate a Traitor who is always bragging of his Honour and Honesty The Men of Honour and Honesty never bragg They let their Actions speak for them I never in all my Lifetime knew a Man who often bragg'd of his Honour or a Woman who often boasted of her Chastity but the one was a true bred Whore and the other a Rascal vile enough to bring a Pillory into fresh Disgrace When a Man boasts of his own moral Virtues is a sign for the most part that he is conscious of the contrary Vices and so has recourse to bragging to blind the Eyes of those with whom he converses But the very Trick by which he cheats Fools discovers him to Men of common Sense and  so his Brains are like the Foxes Heels by which the Beast escapes from Mungrils but is betray'd to the Hounds The greatest Coward boasts most of his Courage The eternal talkative noisie Fool of his Sense Even talking perpetually is implicit bragging For why should a Man talk always more than his Company if he did not believe that Nature had given him a Call for it and made him a perpetual Dictator One Hypocrite makes more Noise and more Shew of his Zeal than twenty real Saints There are Bullies in Honour and in Religion as well as there are in Courage  B  R  is a Bully in all three The Man who wants Gratitude can have no one Virtue whatever  I am Your  c  Whitehall  Oct  TO Mr BRADLEY  SIR  SINCE among the rest of the Obligations which I have to you you have been so generous as to defend me from that Accusation of Illnature which has been brought against me by some who are so far from knowing me that perhaps they never saw me I am animated by so friendly a Proceeding to send you my Thoughts upon this subject as they have from time to time come into my Mind as well as I am able to recollect them in that ill State of Health under which I labour at present  As this Accusation is brought against me by those who are utter Strangers to me it must proceed from the Books which I have publish'd and particularly from the Books of Criticism But if in my Criticism I am in the right my very being so must be a sufficient Apology against  that Accusation For he who accuses a Man of Illnature for writing a just Criticism knows not what is meant by either of the Terms either by Illnature or Criticism By Illnature must be meant something that is contrary to the true Nature of Man as by Goodnature must be understood something that is agreeable to it or the one can be no Term of Reproach nor the other of Commendation But the true Nature of Man must consist in Reason which distinguishes him from all other Creatures and therefore no Discourse or Action that is reasonable can possibly denominate him illnatur'd  But as the true Nature of Man is reasonable it is likewise social and Man is therefore the most social of Creatures because he is the most reasonable Now a just Criticism is perfectly agreeable to the Nature of Man consider'd as 'tis social For what does the good Critic design he designs to detect and disgrace Errour to disclose and honour Truth he designs the Advancement of a noble Art and by it the Interest and Glory of his Native Country which depend in no small measure upon the flourishing of Arts  If he has the greatest Goodness of Nature who has the largest share of social Virtue if he has the largest share of social Virtue who labours most for the Happiness  of the Society in which he lives and of all his FellowCreatures in general if the Happiness of ones Native Country and of Humankind in general depend more under God upon the Maintenance of Liberty than upon any other thing whatsoever who can justly pretend not only of the Writers of the present Age but of the  English  Writers in general to a greater Goodness of Nature than my self who have made it the constant Business of my Life to defend and maintain Liberty Who has taken more delight in praising her Benefactor or in branding and defaming her avowed and mortal Enemies In short Sir Liberty has been the continual Theme of my Pen and the constant Employment of my Life And have I taken all this Pains for my self No I wanted not common Sense to discern that the  British  Liberties would be of longer continuance than my Life But the growing Corruptions of my Countrymen gave me too just grounds to apprehend that Liberty in  Great Britain  would not last many Centuries I therefore resolv'd to cast in my Mite towards the rendring it perpetual in this Island And yet I knew very well and foresaw that by this very Endeavour to serve them I should draw upon me the Hatred of a great part of my Countrymen and by consequence a  thousand different Slanders They have given me distempers of Body and defects of Mind of which I have not the least Knowledge and the Opinion of my Illnature has proceeded as much from my Endeavours to maintain and prolong Liberty and by consequence to perpetuate Happiness to them and to their Posterity as from my detecting and exposing successful Poetasters For which if I am sorry for my self I am more sorry for my Country for a People so dispos'd can be free no longer than their Rulers are willing they should be so I am in so faint and languishing a Condition that I can proceed no further tho' I have many things to say But I will certainly resume this Subject if I ever retrieve my Vigour  I am  c  March  To the Right Honourable the Lord Treasurer GODOLPHIN  My Lord  I Here send your Lordship a Dramatick Poem call'd  Liberty Asserted  which I wrote before I had the Honour to be known to your Lordship and send upon occasion of its being the first  British  Play that is acted that is the first after the Accomplishment of this Happy Union which has been so nobly brought about by your Lordship's Wisdom and which has asserted and ensured the Liberties of  Great Britain  My Lord that this Play's being accidentally reviv'd at this extraornary Juncture may prove of happy Presage to the Prosperity of  Great Britain  and to your Lordship's Fame which must flourish Eternally with this Island's Prosperity is and shall be the zealous and perpetual Wish of  My Lord  Your Lordship's  c  To his GRACE The Duke of BUCKINGHAM  Written in the Name and at the Request of one who design'd to send him the Lives of some of our celebrated  English  Poets  My LORD  THE whole Body of  English  Narrative Poets have here the Honour to wait on your Grace and to desire your Patronage of whom the most celebrated among such of them as were your Contemporaries have so often attended upon you separately to implore your Protection My Lord those among them who are living look upon themselves as Probationers for Fame and cannot be assur'd of that Glory to which they aspire till your Grace has giv'n Judgment concerning them Few of those who are dead have been dead long enough for the World to be assur'  of their real Merit and whether it will be great and lasting enough to pass to our latest Posterity The Opinions of the Publick in Things of this nature are variable and uncertain and the Reputations of Authors are subject to strange Reverses Never any Poet left a greater Reputation behind him than Mr  Cowley  while  Milton  remain'd obscure and known but to few But your Grace knows very well that the great Reputation of  Cowley  did not continue half a Century and that  Milton  's is now upon the Pinacle of the Temple of Fame 'Tis hardly possible that so many Ages should have remain'd in the dark with regard to almost every thing that relates to  Homer  if his Poems had during his Life time been receiv'd with that vast that universal Applause which they met with after his Death  Fannius  an impertinent  Roman  Scribbler yet found so much Success in his own Time and so general an Approbation that both his Works and his Picture were set up in the Library which  Augustus  had consecrated in the Temple of  Apollo Palatine  while  Horace  complains that he was neither read nor known and yet your Grace knows very well that this happen'd at a time when the  Roman  Poetry and the  Roman  Taste were in their Heighth of Excellence But length of Days distinguish'd justly between them and satisfy'd the World of  the nice Judgment and the fine Discernment of  Mecaenas  and  Augustus Caesar  Length of Days my Lord consign'd  Horace  to eternal Fame and  Fannius  to eternal Infamy  The whole Body then of  English  Narrative Poets considering this Uncertainty and this Inconstancy of the People proceeding from their Ignorance and their want of Taste here bring their Causes before your Grace to be tryed by you in the last Appeal and depend no further on the fallible Decrees of the People than as they shall be affirmed by your Grace's Judgment from which they expect an Assurance of Fame and an Earnest of Immortality  My Lord it has been the common Custom of Authors on these Occasions to publish a Panegyrick on their Patron's Excellencies a Custom from which at present I am oblig'd to deviate because nothing is less entertaining than Stale News let the subject matter of it be never so great and glorious If I should relate with how much Bravery in your early Youth you affronted Death in the Cause of your Country when at the same time you were possess'd of every thing that makes Mortals fond of Life when at the same time you were crown'd with Honours laden with Riches and courted by Pleasure If I should tell  the World how muc`h you were distinguish'd by your Gallantry and your Politeness in the most polite and most gallant Court that ever this Island saw that you have been always as penetrating and profound in the Cabinet as you have been active and brave in the Field that in your Administration of the great Offices of the Crown you have shewn your self equal to the greatest  nd the sublimest Employments and that you have been always one of the most shining Ornaments of the most august Assembly in  he World the Reader would cry that this  reprinting an old  Gazette  and pretending to inform People of Actions and Qualities that have been many a Year in the Mouths of all the World and which have been long since much better describ'd by  he Pens of those very Gentlemen of whose Actions and Writings this Volume is compos'd As I should be confounded with so  ust a Reproach I shall confine my self with returning Thanks to your Grace for the Protection which you vouchsafe to grant  this Account of the Lives and Writings of so many Men of Merit in Conjunction  nd for that Protection and Encouragement by which you have several times distinguished several of them I shall content my self with wishing that your Grace may  ong continue to be the shining Ornament of your Country and the Protector of every  generous Art that you may live to see the Noble Marquess of  Normanby  inherit his Father's great Qualities and copy his bright Example to see him rival in Sense in Spirit and in Judgment the immortal Offspring of your Mind to see him rival your own  Brutus  in defending the Rights of his Country and asserting the Liberties of Mankind but defending the one and asserting the other with that glorious Success and that transcendent Happiness which ought always to attend the Champions of publick Liberty  I am My LORD Your Grace's  c  TO WALTER MOYLE  Esq  Dear SIR  I Was so very much tyr'd the last Post with sending away several Letters that I was incapable of writing any thing that could have been agreeable to you tho' it had been never so short I am sorry to hear of the Complaints you make of the Effects of the Spleen I desire you to pardon my plaindealing which proceeds purely from that Esteem and Affection which I have always had for you ever since I had the Honour to know you before I venture to tell you that a Person of your Fortune and Understanding need not have the Spleen any longer than he pleases The Spleen is nothing but the Effect of Stagnation and the Motion of vigorous Exercise must and will cure it Take a gentle trotting Horse and an honest careful Servant and come up and see your old Friends and this wicked Town but for one  Fortnight and if the Journey to this Town and back again into  Cornwal  and the strange Sights which you will see here do not remove the Spleen for one six Months I will be contented to have it for twelve For you who have now been absent twenty Years will find here a Town entirely new new Buildings new Men new Manners Avarice and Luxury and Profusion joyned in a Triple League and Liberty Property and Religion engag'd in a Battel Royal You will find here entirely new Setts of all Sorts of Men new Players at Chess who never could yet see two Removes before them new Whigs without one Dram of Publick Spirit and new Wits and Poets without one Grain of Common Sense You will find a new Idol worship'd in the midst of a Christian Country a base dirty contemptible Idol worship'd by all that once was thought great and noble and estimable You will find his Temple in the midst of that Country's Metropolis a Temple as dirty and despicable as its Deity a Temple without either Roof or Door or Desk or Pew or Altar yet its pragmatical Priests as proud as they are base and sordid his Priests compos'd of insolent Cits and Pe  rs and Pr  es his humble Worshippers who humbly worship nay abjectly adore both the Idol and his Priests  you will see his Worshippers arrive in Crowds from Morning to the Evening and mingled in his Temple in as monstrous a manner as the Elements were in Chaos where Fire with Water Earth with Air were blended and confounded As all these Sights will be new I believe they will be very diverting and what will be as new and as diverting as all the rest you will see in this Town old Friends with new Shapes and Faces For Example you will find your old Friend Mr  W  dwindled to those narrow Dimensions in which you formerly beheld me and your humble Servant enlarg'd to his  quondam  noble Bulk and Proportions  I am  c  London  May  To the Honourable Major PACK  Containing some remarkable Passages of Mr WYCHERLEY's Life  SIR  I Have lately had the Satisfaction to read over your Memoirs of Mr  Wycherley  which I had last Week from Mr  C  and found the Relation very entertaining and the Reflections just and pathetick If I give you Hints of some particular Passages which seem either to have slipt from your Memory or to have escaped your Knowledge I flatter my self that you will receive them kindly since they are only sent with Intention to give you an Opportunity whenever you have a mind to retouch your Memoirs to make them more compleat tho' they cannot be more agreeable  And now Sir to enter upon the Subject without any more Ceremony I never  could learn either from Mr  Wycherley  himself or from Mr  Dryden  or Sir  Harry Sheer  or Mr  Walkeden  or from any of those who had been longest acquainted with Mr  Wycherley  that he had ever resided at either of our Universities About the Age of Fifteen he was sent for Education to the Western Parts of  France  either to  Saintonge  or the  Angoumois  His Abode there was either upon the Banks of the  Charante  or very little remov'd from it And he had there the Happiness to be in the Neighbourhood of one of the most accomplish'd Ladies of the Court of  France Madame de Montausier  whom  Voiture  has made famous by several very ingenious Letters the most of which were writ to her when she was a Maid and call'd  Madamoiselle de Rambouillet  I have heard Mr  W  say that he was often admitted to the Conversation of that Lady who us'd to call him the Little  Hugenot  and that young as he was he was equally pleas'd with the Beauty of her Mind and with the Graces of her Person  Upon the writing his first Play which was  St James  's  Park  he became acquainted with several of the most celebrated Wits both of the Court and Town The writing of that Play was likewise the Occasion of his becoming acquainted with one of King  Charles  's Mistesses after a very particular manner  As Mr  Wycherley  was going thro'  Pallmall  towards St  James  's in his Chariot he met the foresaid Lady in hers who thrusting half her Body out of the Chariot cry'd out aloud to him  You  Wycherley  you are a Son of a Whore  at the same time laughing aloud and heartily Perhaps Sir if you never heard of this Passage before you may be surpris'd at so strange a Greeting from one of the most beautiful and best bred Ladies in the World Mr  Wycherley  was certainly very much surpris'd at it yet not so much but he soon apprehended it was spoke with Allusion to the latter End of a Song in the foremention'd Play  When Parents are Slaves  Their Brats cannot be any other  Great Wits and great Braves  Have always a Punk to their Mother  As during Mr  Wycherley  's Surprise the Chariots drove different ways they were soon at a considerable Distance from each other when Mr  Wycherley  recovering from his Surprise ordered his Coachman to drive back and to overtake the Lady As soon as he got overagainst her he said to her  Madam you have been pleased to bestow a Title on me which generally belongs to the Fortunate Will your Ladyship be at the Play to Night Well  she reply'd  what if I am  there Why then I will be there to wait on your Ladyship tho' I disappoint a very fine Woman who has made me an Assignation So  said she  you are sure to disappoint a Woman who has favour'd you for one who has not Yes  he reply'd  if she who has not favour'd me is the finer Woman of the two But he who will be constant to your Ladyship till he can find a finer Woman is sure to die your Captive  The Lady blush'd and bade her Coachman drive away As she was then in all her Bloom and the most celebrated Beauty that was then in  England  or perhaps that has been in  England  since she was touch'd with the Gallantry of that Compliment In short she was that Night in the first Row of the King's Box in  Drury Lane  and Mr  Wycherley  in the Pit under her where he entertained her during the whole Play And this Sir was the beginning of a Correspondence between these two Persons which afterwards made a great Noise in the Town  But now Sir I shall proceed to remind you of something more extraordinary and that is that the Correspondence between Mr  Wycherley  and the foresaid Lady was the Occasion of bringing Mr  Wycherley  into favour with  George  Duke of  Buckingham  who was passionately in Love with that Lady who was ill treated by her and who believed Mr  Wycherley  his happy Rival  After the Duke had long sollicited her without obtaining any thing whether the Relation between them shock'd her for she was his CousinGermain or whether she apprehended that an Intrigue with a Person of his Rank and Character a Person upon whom the Eyes of all Men were fix'd must of Necessity in a little time come to the King's Ears whatever was the Cause she refus'd to admit of his Visits so long that at last Indignation Rage and Disdain took Place of his Love and he resolv'd to ruin her When he had taken this Resolution he had her so narrowly watch'd by his Spies that he soon came to the Knowledge of those whom he had reason to believe his Rivals And after he knew them he never fail'd to name them aloud in order to expose the Lady to all those who frequented him and among others he us'd to name Mr  Wycherley  As soon as it came to the Knowledge of the latter who had all his Expectations from the Court he apprehended the Consequence of such a Report if it should reach the King He applied himself therefore to  Wilmot  Lord  Rochester  and to Sir  Charles Sedley  and entreated them to remonstrate to the Duke of  Buckingham  the Mischief which he was about to do to one who had not the Honour to be known to him and who had never offended him Upon their opening  the Matter to the Duke he cry'd out immediately  that he did not blame  Wycherley  he only accus'd his Cousin Ay but  they reply'd  by rendring him suspected of such an Intrigue you are about to ruine him that is your Grace is about to ruine a Man with whose Conversation you would be pleas'd above all things  Upon this Occasion they said so much of the shining Qualities of Mr  Wycherley  and of the Charms of his Conversation that the Duke who was as much in love with Wit as he was with his Kinswoman was impatient till he was brought to sup with him which was in two or three Nights After Supper Mr  Wycherley  who was then in the Height of his Vigor both of Body and Mind thought himself oblig'd to exert himself and the Duke was charm'd to that degree that he cry'd out in a Transport  By G  my Cousin is in the right of it  and from that very Moment made a Friend of a Man whom he believ'd his happy Rival  The Duke of  Buckingham  gave him solid sensible Proofs of his Esteem and Affection For as he was at the same time Master of the Horse to King  Charles  and Colonel of a Regiment as Master of the Horse he made him one of his Equeries and as Colonel of a Regiment he made him Captain Lieutenant of his own Company resigning to him at the same time his own  Pay as Captain and all other Advantages that could be justly made of the Company I remember that about that time I who was come up from the University to see my Friends in Town happen'd to be one Night at the Fountain Tavern in the  Strand  with the late Dr  Duke David Loggen  the Painter and Mr  Wilson  of whom  Otway  has made honourable Mention in  Tonson  's first Miscellany and that after Supper we drank Mr  Wycherley  's Health by the Name of Captain  Wycherley  He was not long after this in such high Favour with the King that that Monarch gave him a Proof of his Esteem and Affection which never any Sovereign Prince before had given to an Author who was only a private Gentleman Mr  Wycherley  happen'd to fall sick of a Feaver at his Lodgings in  Bowstreet Covent Garden  during which Sickness the King did him the Honour to visit him when finding his Feaver indeed abated but his Body extremely weaken'd and his Spirits miserably shatter'd he commanded him as soon as he was able to take a Journey to go to the South of  France  believing that nothing would contribute more to the restoring his former Vigour than the gentle salutiferous Air of  Montpelier  during the Winter Season At the same time the King was pleas'd to assure him  that as soon as he was capable  of taking that Journey he would order five hundred Pounds to be paid him to defray the Expence of it  Mr  Wycherley  accordingly went into  France  in the beginning of the Winter of if I am not mistaken and returned into  England  in the latter end of the Spring of entirely restor'd to his former Vigor both of Body and Mind The King receiv'd him with the utmost Marks of Favour and shortly after his Arrival told him that he had a Son who he was resolv'd should be educated like the Son of a King and that he could make Choice of no Man so proper to be his Governor as Mr  Wycherley  that for that Service he should have fifteen hundred Pounds a Year paid him for the Payment of which he should have an Assignment upon three several Offices whose Names I have forgot to which the King added  that when the Time came that his Office was to cease he would take care to make such a Provision for him as should set him above the Malice of the World and Fortune  And now Sir is it not matter of Wonder that one of Mr  Wycherley  's extraordinary Merit who was esteem'd by all the most deserving Persons of the Court of King  Charles  the Second and in high Favour with the King himself should in a little time after he had received these gracious  Offers which seem to have made and to have fix'd his Fortune be thrown into Prison for bare seven hundred Pounds and be suffer'd to languish there during the last four Years of that Monarch's Reign forsaken by all his Friends at Court and quite abandon'd by the King 'Tis no easie matter Sir to find a more extraordinary Instance of the Vicissitude of Human Affairs and if the Cause of so strange an Alteration is unknown to you I dare promise my self that you are very desirous to hear it  It was immediately after Mr  Wycherley  had received these gracious Offers from the King that the Waterdrinking Season coming on he went down to  Tunbridge  to take either the Benefit of the Waters or the Diversions of the Place when walking one Day upon the Wells Walk with his Friend Mr  Fairbeard  of  Grey'sInn  just as he came up to the Bookseller's my Lady  Drogheda  a young Widow rich noble and beautiful came to the Bookseller and enquir'd for  the Plain Dealer Madam  says Mr  Fairbeard since you are for the  Plain Dealer  there he is for you  pushing Mr  Wycherley  towards her  Yes  says Mr  Wycherley this Lady can bear plain Dealing for she appears to be so accomplish'd that what would be Compliment said to others spoke to her would be plain Dealing No truly Sir  said the Lady  I am not without  my Faults any more than the rest of my Sex and yet notwithstanding all my Faults I love plain Dealing and never am more fond of it than when it tells me of my Faults Then Madam  said Mr  Fairbeard you and the  Plain Dealer  seem design'd by Heaven for each other  In short Mr  Wycherley  walk'd with her upon the Walks waited upon her home visited her daily at her Lodgings while she staid at  Tunbridge  and after she went to  London  at her Lodgings in  Hatton Garden  where in a little time he got her Consent to marry her which he did by his Father's Command without acquainting the King for it was reasonably suppos'd that the Lady having a great Independant Estate and noble and powerful Relations the acquainting the King with the intended Marriage might be the likeliest way to prevent it As soon as the News of it came to Court it was look'd upon as an Affront to the King and a Contempt of his Majesty's Offers And Mr  Wycherley  's Conduct after his Marriage made this be resented more heinously For seldom or never coming near the Court he was thought downright ungrateful But the true Cause of his Absence was not known and the Court was at that time too much alarm'd and in too much Disquiet to enquire into it In short Sir the Lady was jealous of him to Distraction jealous to that  degree that she could not endure that he should be one Moment out of her Sight Their Lodgings were in  Bowstreet CoventGarden  overagainst the  Cock  whither if he at any time went with his Friends he was oblig'd to leave the Windows open that the Lady might see there was no Woman in Company or she would be immediately in a downright raving Condition Whether this outragious Jealousy proceeded from the excess of her Passion for she lov'd her Husband with the same Violence with which she had done her Lover or from the great Things which she had heard reported of his manly Prowess which were not answer'd by her Experience or from them both together Mr  Wycherley  thought that he was oblig'd to humour it and that he could not be too indulgent to a Lady who had bestow'd both her Person and her Fortune on him This Sir was the Cause that brought Mr  Wycherley  all at once into the utmost Disgrace with the Court whose Favour and Affection but just before he possessed in the highest Degree And these Sir are the Particulars of Mr  Wycherley  's Life which seem either to have slipt from your Memory or to have escaped your Knowledge  I am  c  Sept
