MY LORD  YOUR Grace's ready condescension in per∣mitting the following trifle to be dedicated to You shews how exceedingly an honour may be heightened by the manner of conferring it Permit me therefore to assure Your Grace in the words of the elegant Pliny  Dum tu occa∣siones obligandi ità me libenter amplecteris ego nemini libentiùs debeo  Which I beg leave to submit as the best reason I

PREFACE  THE Author presents his compliments to the Ladies and Gentlemen engaged in the Hotel particularly Mr  King  Mr  Parsons  and Miss  P Hopkins  With pleasure acquiesces in the general opinion that the principal success and uncommon applause the subsequent petite piece has been received with is very justly attributed to the great attention and excellence of the performance for which they have his best thanks and warmest good wishes  And with regard to any merit he might lay claim to in the production the situation of an author as described in the underwritten passage  Denique non omnes eadem mirantur amantque  Carmine tu gaudes hic delectatur lambis  Ille Bioneis sermonibus sale nigro  Tres mihi convivae prope dissentire videntur  Poscentes vario multum diversa palato  Quid

public prints  prevent his falling into that vanity and selfconceit which bears such strong ascendancy over the minds of most men and of authors in particular And if his scenes but amuse in the closet in proportion to their favourable reception on the stage his utmost wish is gratified  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr KING  To hear with candour ere we judge a cause  Is the known  Magna Charta  of all laws

view of  Low's Hotel  Time of Action  FIVE HOURS  N B  Some few passages are omitted in the Repre∣sentation as being judged too long  THE HOTEL OR THE DOUBLE VALET  ACT I SCENE I  An apartment in Sir Jacob's house  Flavia discovered working at the Tambour Tabby waiting  Flavia  AND are you sure Tabby the postman had no letters for me today I am cer∣tain it was his rap which has more music in it to the ears of an expecting lover than the most favourite air of a Fisher or Bach  Tabby  Indeed madam were I young and handsome as you are I would not be  balk'd  about it for tho' Mr Montague neglects writing Sir John Seymour would not had he the same opportunity  Flavia  Sir John Seymour What know you pray of Sir John Seymour  rising displeas'd at her pertness  Tabby  Nay nothing madam only  Flavia  Only what I charge you speak  Tabby  That he must love you madam and that dearly to be so vast generous as he is to me upon all occasions  Flavia  I hope you don't accept of any favors from him  Tabby  Lord madam he does  the favor  so genteely and so privately there's no refusing the gentleman  Flavia  I charge you as you value your place to decline any thing his generosity offers as you are not to learn of my father's having early contracted me to another abroad  Tabby  And yet madam I should think a bird in the cage is worth two in the air And as to my old master Sir Jacob so as he parts not with his money he cares not I believe had you married the Hoitytoity man from beyond sea or were to elope with our Robin  Flavia  I must tell you you give your tongue a liberty very unbecoming depending I suppose for your security on the confidence I have placed in you But as my prior engagement prevents I fear any ho∣nourable conclusion with Sir John I beg no more impertinence on that head  Tabby  pertly  Madam I can be secret as well as another when services are thus rewarded  Flavia  Leave me  reseating herself at the tambour  Tabby  They first make us familiar then wonder at our freedom  Aside Exit  Enter Sir Jacob not seeing Flavia  Sir Jacob  returned from walking fatigued  Mercy on me what a pity it is one cannot take a hackney∣coach as formerly I used a seat in a Playhouse at half price It would be the certain making of me Where∣as this walking every day to and from 'Change creates such an appetite that I foresee I shall eat myself out of house and home before Christmas unless indeed I should be fortunate enough to be laid up with a strong fit of the gout or visited by that old family complaint the rheumatism Rare disorders both for economy no eating no drinking no But why delay commu∣nicating the contents of friend Wentworth's letter to my daughter Flavia  going sees Flavia  Ah Flavia child good morrow  Flavia  rising  Sir good day to you  Sir Jacob  Ah child my good days are all over  Flavia  All over Sir you alarm me I do not un∣derstand you  Sir Jacob  Not any thing succeeds that I undertake deceived at home disappointed abroad every day brings on new expences and no money to pay with  Flavia  Excuse me if I conceive you torment your∣self Sir without a cause as in the city I know you to be esteemed a good man  Sir Jacob  Who me child good I good Heaven forgive them who say so ill of me  Flavia  Is it then saying any ill of you Sir to say you are rich  Sir Jacob  Can they say worse for supposing me rich how can I be safe shall I not be assassinated will not my house be surrounded night and day with thieves Double locks treble keys and a hamper of padlocks will not avail me any thing  Flavia  If your affairs are as desperate as you would have them thought permit me to enquire what it is you have in that strong box in your study so curiously chain'd to the wall which you keep lock'd with treble keys and visit so regularly twice aday  Sir Jacob  eagerly  Strong box child what strong box I have no strong boxThat you see is an old iron chest bought as a fixture with the house and I keep it locked because there is nothing in it fit to be seen  Flavia  How then Sir are you to defray the ex∣pences of my marriage when  Sir Jacob  interrupting her  Why that child is the very disappointment I was mentioning Your intend∣ed husband Mr Montague is coming over it's true but 'tis in his coffin I hear  Flavia  How Sir in his coffin say you  Sir Jacob  Yes Our neighbour Wentworth has been with me this morning with an account from abroad of his death in some absurd duelI don't like these same duelsshall ne'er like them againas by this means you are at present disappointed of getting a husbandand I  aside  in getting rid of a daughter Mercy on me how care as a body may say mounts behind a man  Flavia  The  manner  of his death Sir I own affects me and must have felt it severely had not our know∣ledge of each other been in its infancy when he left England Are you acquainted Sir with any other particulars relative to this unhappy affair  Sir Jacob  Not any one misfortune I thought suf∣ficient to know at a time Besides my thoughts were immediately turned on the hopes of recovering some∣thing from his executors on the contract for though he has lost his life child it is no reason I should lose my money  Flavia  How Sir recover on the contract And is it possible such an idea could enter into your mind at an hour like that you received the fatal news in  Sir Jacob  Night and day child business must be minded "Take care of business and it will take care of you" is an excellent saying and as the opinion I mean to take will cost me nothing why if I find myself without a remedy I'll e'en oblige you and think no more about it So child I'll just step in send Robin to market and then to cousin  Capias  make a case of it as of a pauper and return immediately  going returns  Do you hear not a word of my being a good man or any strong box I charge you  Exit  Flavia  How undesignedly do we oftentimes take pains to discover the very thing we would most wish to conceal Nor am I I fear if I examine my own heart less guilty in this particular than my father for with all my caution and reprimands to this maid of mine I fear she is more in the secret of my heart about Sir John Seymour than I could wish her Surely 'tis a strange weakness our sex are ever guilty of in thus making confidants of those whose very interest it is oftentimes to betray us But hark by the noise my father I fear is returned  looking out  as I live and with him Tabby trembling like quicksilver  Sir Jacob  noise without as he enters  So madam Minx you thought to escape me with this letter did you  Enter Sir Jacob holding Tabby trembling  Relying I warrant on my not having as much Mer∣cury in my heels now as formerly but you are mis∣taken you jade I have enough left yet to do your business And now pray tell me from whence comes it and for whom is it design'd For I can see no direction or postmark it has  looking at it as he con∣tinues holding her  Flavia  Thanks to the happy invention of lemon∣juice  Aside  Tabby  Dear Sir I am all over in such a fluster not knowing what you meant to be at upon the stairs that I scarce know whether I stand upon my head or my heels nor shall I be able to recover myself or tell you a single syllable this halfhour unless you take off your handcuffs  Sir Jacob  Whence had it you I say  Tabby  significantly  From a man Sir  Sir Jacob  As I suspected And for my daughter I suppose  Tabby  Yes Sir for your daughtermy mistress  Flavia  aside to Tabby  Why sure you do not mean to discover me  Tabby  aside  Trust me for that madam  Sir Jacob  to Flavia  And you know it's contents perhaps  Flavia  Not I truly Sir How is it possible I should know what a letter contains before it comes to my hands and you do not seem very willing to part with it  Sir Jacob  Not till Mrs Pert there satisfies my curio∣sity by telling me from what man she had it  Tabby  That then Sir I can soon do by assuring you I received it from Mr Edging the manmillener in Tavistockstreet and contains I suppose some new pattern for a ruffle taken from the Lady's Magazine  Flavia  aside  Female policy never fails a chambermaid at a pinch I see  Sir Jacob  Oh a pattern Is that all  Tabby  All yes Sir all And a very pretty pattern no doubt you have made of yourself in this business  Sir Jacob  Peace insolence Here then child  giving the letter to Flavia  take the pattern if it is one  Flavia  opens it and in opening drops the cover  Yes Sir it is a pattern I assure you and one when I have finish'd I hope you will approve  Sir Jacob  as Flavia is examining the supposed pattern  Not having any direction on it this cover may serve to keep a whole year's accounts Ah what would become of me if I did not  stoop  as he takes it up  to these things myself  Tabby  aside  What a miserable suspicious covetous oldHad he been my father I believe I should have poisoned him a twelvemonth ago  Sir Jacob  to Flavia expressing looks of great pleasure at the letter  Why daughter you seem to be wonder∣fully taken methinks with that same patternMy mind misgives me strangely  Aside  Tabby  aside  How truly now does he speak with∣out knowing it  Flavia  It contains to deceit believe me Sir  putting the letter in her pocket  and with your leave will in∣stantly go and  draw  it out  Sir Jacob  Well well do so child  Flavia  Come then Tabby follow me I shall have occasion for your assistance  Exit  Tabby  aside as she is taking the frame in her hand and following  He little suspects I believe that  fire  is the engine my mistress  draws  with upon these occa∣sions  Exit  Sir Jacob  Go for an impudent baggageAnd now for neighbour  Capias  whose opinion I must know before I discover  Enter Robin hastily with a basket of eggs  Softly rascal or you will break all the eggs Why where are you running in such a plaguy hurry  Robin  To get dinner ready quickly and not waste the fire  Sir Jacob  Blockhead fool ass have I not told you a thousand times never to light the fire till the things for dinner are all brought into the house How∣ever I have put it outtherefore stay and  Robin  Zooks what a  stopping his mouth as if going on  Sir Jacob  Why you rascal if I had not a little  oeconomy in these matters you could not eat as you do twice aday  Robin  aside  And when at father's I am sure I eat more at once  Sir Jacob  But come let's know what sort of a bargain you have made  Robin  Here they are the best in the market eggs at a halfpenny apiece  Sir Jacob  And a dear bargain too  Looking at them  Too small by the sixteenth of an inch I see already Oh Heavens if I send such an extravagant dog as you to market I shall soon be ruin'd Well spendthrift and how many have you brought me  Robin  A groat's worth  Sir Jacob  A groat's worth Did ever any body hear the like And what the devil sirrah can we do do you think with eight eggs  Robin  Why Sir a'n't we four in family  Sir Jacob  I know it puppy but can any person eat more than one egg blockhead Besides a good servant who minds his master's interest would go to the cook's cheapen every jointtaste allbuy noneand make a good meal into the bargain Therefore do you hear puppy take 'em in and measure me four by my own eggscaleyou'll find it in the studythe rest you may carry back I will not have them And be sure make haste as I'm but stepping to next door and shall not be long before I return  Exit  Robin  taking up the basket  Not having any bowels himself he never thinks of those who have Measure an egg  looking at them  was there ever such a  Save∣all  O  as he is going  PinchGutFarm how have I wrong'd you in the many wry words I have given thee  Exit  Enter Flavia with a letter Tabby following  Flavia  Well Tabby this attention and constancy of Sir John's knowing me contracted to another at the time he first profess'd a partiality for me I own is more than I expected for the men in general let them say what they will are  a mere changeable silk  Tabby  Yes madam but Sir John like your old garnet and white tabby  curtsying  is  laing  you see  A hint this I think she has worn it long enough I hope she'll take it  Aside  Flavia  giving the letter  And now Tabby to your care and management I commit this letter which if possible deliver to Sir John himself I have there confirm'd to him the unfortunate affair of Mr Mon∣tague and of my present situation  Tabby  taking the letter  Rather an unlucky affair for Mr Montague to be sure madam but it's an ill wind they say blows nobody good and your remedy I believe waits only to be taken to hand  Flavia  Waste no time good Tabby in talking but instantly go lest my father return and enquire for you Besides I'm all impatience to know the result of my letter before I speak to him on the subject  Tabby  Good or bad I'll not delay it madam and as the distance is not far I shall not be long in my return  going halfmeets Sir Jacob and slips on one side to avoid him  Enter Sir Jacob hastily and agitated  Sir Jacob  So so so misfortune on misfortune and no remedy on the contract How all mankind conspire to torment meBut may not cousin Capias have been guilty of a little mistake in practice here  The greatest lawyers have been  What if I send a Quaere or two to the AttorneyGeneral of the Ledger  He is in full practice  and gives his opinion gratis But then like many other opinions it may be worth nothing when I've got it as he's often more  knotty  than his tye Sure I was born a martyr to disappointments  Flavia  advancing sorward  What trifle has discon∣certed you now Sir  Sir Jacob  Trifle All alike I see seeking my ruin And where pray is that Jezebel your maid  Flavia  Gone out Sir  Sir Jacob  Gone out To lay out more money perhaps  Flavia  Rather I hope to bring some in Sir If you knew all  Sir Jacob  eagerly  Ay Flavia How my child That's a good girl tell me and be some comfort to me in the midst of my misfortunes  Flavia  Why Sirthe letter  Sir Jacob  Well childwhat of the letter tell me  Flavia  Was as you suspected no pattern but a letter from  Sir Jacob  From whom Speak for I long to be weighing the money  Flavia  But you must first Sirweigh the man if my happiness has any interest with you  Sir Jacob  That child depends entirely upon what the principal is therefore explain for as yet I un∣derstand you not  Flavia  You must know then Sir that letter was from Sir John Seymour  Sir Jacob  Well child from Sir John Seymour Go on  Flavia  Your impatience Sir prevents my pro∣ceeding  Sir Jacob  Proceed then  Flavia  Who has long been an admirer of mine  Sir Jacob  Why I protest I begin to admire you myself child  Flavia  Let me entreat you Sir to  Sir Jacob  Well well I have done child Go on  Flavia  But knowing the early contract you made with Mr Montague he despaired of success and declined carrying his partiality for me beyond a gene∣rous and polite friendship but being since inform'd of the unhappy fate of Mr Montague has ventured to write on that subject with a tender of his hand and heart in case I confirm'd the truth of this information  Sir Jacob  Well and you have confirm'd it have you not  Still eagerly  Flavia  I have Sir and Tabby is now gone with the answer  Sir Jacob  And wrote you nothing more  Flavia  Yes Sir that I would take an early opportunity of communicating the affair to you and if possible prevail on you to permit his visits more openly  Sir Jacob  That was dutiful and you know child I was ever easily prevail'd on to your advantageor my own Sir John expects no money I suppose  Flavia  My situation Sir has hitherto made it  impossible for me ever to know his sentiments on that head  Enter Tabby hastily  Tabby  eagerly with a letter not seeing Sir Jacob  Well madam I have seen Sir John and here is  Sir Jacob  snatching it out of her hand  Another pattern is it Mrs Contriver However Flavia take and read it that I may know what way I may be pre∣vailed on in this business  Tabby  So so my mistress has discovered all and now see who will I suppose  Aside  Flavia  opening the letter and reads  My admired and muchloved Flavia to a heart panting with suspense and fear your letter brought the most pleasing cordial and I shall be the happiest of men when you have gained Sir Jacob's consent to throw myself and fortune at your feet Therefore fail not to use your most powerful rhetoric in the favour of  Dear Flavia  Your ever affectionate JOHN SEYMOUR  Sir Jacob  Short sensible and to the purpose I like it well and from it's contents believe I shall not give your rhetoric child much trouble as I find myself more than half inclined to give my consent already  Tabby  pertly  As things then Sir should not be done by halves give your full consent at once and let me go tell Sir John you'll be glad to see him  Sir Jacob  Do you think hussey your mistress has not a tongue of her own that she needs your alarum to be always going  Flavia  Her good wishes for my happiness Sir may make her perhaps freer than is becoming you must excuse her therefore for my sake and as I have no reason to doubt the sincerity of Sir John let me pre∣vail on you to see him for I confess he won my heart when I had not a hand to give him  Sir Jacob  And now you have he must not look for a single guinea to cross it with if he expects my consent  Flavia  Well Sir but will it not be time enough to refuse when he makes the request  Sir Jacob  No child a request in moneymatters is better prevented than refused Therefore you had better send and let him know I am at home and shall be glad to see him and the sooner the better for delays I find are dangerous  going towards the table  Tabby  You see madamjust as I saidno matter who the man isfor I'll venture to say he knows no more of Sir John than I do the length of his bags or he the getting up small linen  Flavia  Well well Tabby  interrupting her  delay not but fly with your message instantly and in a lover's key tell him the pleasing news  Exeunt Flavia and Tabby different ways  Sir Jacob alone pulls out a leathern bag scales and weights sits down at the table pulling it forward  Sir Jacob  And now I'm alone I may safely examine neighbour Heeltap's rent for "Count money they say after your father" aye and weigh it too as the world goes if you would avoid being cheated And yet after all our care and caution a light guinea I see  taking one in his hand  will be creeping in This knave of a Crispin had but five pounds to pay me for a whole year's rent and three out of the five I see are short  weighing  Oh the hang dog the sweater I will instantly send him notice to quit at Christmas Here Robin Robin  gets up and goes towards the door to call looking every now and then at the table where the money is  Why Robin I say  as he returns to the table hears a knocking  Mercy on me what vile noise is that I hear Upon these occasions a man's money  putting it up  is never safer than in his own pocket and now come who will  Enter Robin introducing Wentworth and Sir John  Robin  Master Wentworth Sir and Sir and Sir John Sey∣mour  Sir Jacob  I am glad to see you neighbour and your friend there  Wentworth  A friend of mine Sir Jacob why he is more likely to be a friend of yours I understand  Sir Jacob  Ah that's as it may turn out  Sir John  Miss Flavia your daughter Sir has long been the object of my affection  Sir Jacob  Has sheHere Robin  eagerly  go call her downThe fight of her perhaps may throw him off his guard  Aside  Robin  Yes Sir  Exit  Sir John  And but for a prior engagement I under∣stood she was under should have declared my inten∣tions much sooner  Sir Jacob  She has no money Sir John a right philosopher she carries all she has about her But then she's a girl of such prudence  Sir John  And that's a rare quality in this age  Sir Jacob  Why she is prudence itself writes an admirable hand and casts accounts like a broker  Sir John  Uncommon talents these  Sir Jacob  And then she works with her needle like a nun  Sir John  A fortune in itself  Sir Jacob  And in my mind as good if not ac∣tually better than money Why prudence is worth at least a hundred ayear and a hundred ayear in the three and a half  per cent  is worth l there's one item Writing will save a steward's wages that's l ayear and in the three and a half  per cent  is worth at least l there's another item Needlework is dear now her needlework is worth at least l ayear l ayear long annuities is l more So you see Sir John there's a fortune of l paid down at once no bonds no mortgages all ready money prompt payment Mr Wentworth  Wentworth  And my friend Sir John I dare say will not have the least objection to settle the whole of the lady's fortune on her  Sir Jacob  Will he  Sir John  And a considerable addition from my own Sir Jacob sufficient I hope to make two affectionate hearts happy or rather one for  seeing Flavia  here comes all my soul holds dear  Flavia enters and retires with Sir John to the back of the stage  Sir Jacob  to Wentworth half whispering  But is Sir John neighbour tenant in fee or tenant for life only for that you know  Wentworth  Yes Sir Jacob I know you are the most fortunate man in the world in having such a soninlaw in himself amiable in his family noble in his fortune independent  Sir Jacob  Say you so why then if he settles her fortune upon her for life and his own upon first and other sons in tailmale I think I may venture to give my consent without further enquiry And so Sir John and daughter Flavia  as they come forward  as the making of others happy is two and a half  per cent  better than making one's self so why you have my consent to marry when you please In the mean time that I may not retract being old and have gotten but a shallow memory with your leave Sir John we will enter into a bit of a contract which our friend Went∣worth here will witness on your part and I on that of my daughter  Sir John  I cannot have the least objection Sir and with your leave Sir Jacob will ring for pen ink and paper  Sir Jacob  I believe I can save you the trouble  pull∣ing out the cover he pick'd up and a leather inkbottle  and at the table there we shall finish this business in the dispatch of a transferSee how  aside as they go to the table looking at the cover  time and accident bring things to use  seats himself at the table and writes  Of what place shall I write you  to Sir John  Sir John  Of SeymourPlace in Dorsetshire  Sir Jacob  writing  Of SeymourPlace in Dorset∣shire There  rises and gives the paper to Sir John  I believe little else is necessary now but to sign  Sir John  reads and returns it  Not any thing Sir  Wentworth  But should not the lady Sir Jacob have read to her what she is to sign  Sir Jacob  No she's a dutiful girl and will sign any thing I bid herThere  giving her the paper  Flavia  As for instance Sir  takes it to the table and signs it  Sir Jacob  But as you Sir John are principal in this business you'll please to sign next  Sir John  Most chearfully  goes and signs it  Sir Jacob  And now that jezebel Tabby once dis∣charged all my  she  cares are over  Tabby enters as Sir John is signing it  Tabby  hastily  Robin Sir being out of the way I answered the door myself and here is a strange ser∣vant below earnest to speak with you  Sir Jacob  eagerly taking the contract from the table comes forward  How with me say you  Tabby  Yes Sir with you and you only and that instantly he says  Exit  Enter Trimwell abruptly  Trimwell  My very words believe me Sir Jacob  Sir Jacob  hastily going up to him  Well fellow would you speak with any one here  Trimwell  Or I must return you no answer Sir  sig∣nificantly  Sir Jacob  And what want you who are you whence come you  earnestly  Trimwell  Softly good old gentleman if you please three interrogations in a breath are too much for any honest man to answer  Sir Jacob  Will you tell me fellow who you are I say or will you get out of my house  Trimwell  The first before the last if you please then and at a word I am the servant of my master  Sir Jacob  But who is your master jackanapes  Trimwell  A stranger good Sir therefore as a stranger with your leave I will return and say you give him welcome  as if going stops  Sir Jacob  Has this stranger no name varlet  Trimwell  Doubtless and I think a very honest one 'Tis  significantly  somewhat of the longest I confess his name is George Frederic Montague  Flavia Wentworth and Sir John expressing great surprize at hearing the name  Sir Jacob  Who how what  Trimwell  Yes SirGeorge Frederic Montague who as I said before has the good fortune to have me for his servantis just arrived post from Dover desires to see you sent me with this message and now expects my return with impatience to be admitted  to be delivered in a quick affected tone  And if you want to know who I am my nameor rather namesfor you must knowlike master like manI have my threeJohn Epaulet Trimwell gentleman and valetdechambre as you see to this very honorable stranger  Sir Jacob  'Tis all a lie rascal Mr Montague your master as you impudently call him is dead  Trimwell  significantly  Dead is he  Sir Jacob  Yes dead  Trimwell  Poor gentleman he must certainly walk then for he was alive and in tolerable good spirits not a quarter of an hour ago and they must have done him great injustice to have killed him without my knowing any thing of the matter  Sir Jacob  Just or unjust I tell you he is dead ab∣solutely dead  Wentworth  to Trimwell  I believe there is no doubt of it  Trimwell  Excuse me Sir if my doubts are not so easily satisfied and with your leave will step and soon convince ye ye are all in the wrong here  Exit  Wentworth  What can all this mean Sir Jacob this fellow is either a knave or a fool  Sir Jacob  Both neighbour Wentworth both and deserves to be set in the stocks A rascal I wish I were a justice of the peace for his sake  Wentworth  And yet what he says of Mr Montague seems very particular notwithstanding my letter  Flavia  But see he returns and with him the person whom he calls his master  Trimwell enters introducing Clarissa Montague persona∣ting her brother as if just arrived from Paris  Trimwell  Permit me gentlemen to introduce my dead master to you and pray peruse him well Do  Sir speak and convince this honorable company and particularly that good old gentleman there  pointing to Sir Jacob  that you are really flesh and blood and not the dead thing they took you for  Clarissa  Why really Sir Jacob I must confess it has more the appearance of the one than the other from the strange reception my sudden arrival has met with from you which ought to be what the French call  enjoué  and not hold a  barbare  English consultation to know whether you are at home or not  Sir Jacob  putting the contract into his pocket  Beggars and strangers young gentleman I am never at home to  Clarissa  But as I am neither one or the other Sir I  Sir Jacob  No why who are you I know you not Your gentleman puppy there indeed calls you George Frederic Montague but he fell in a duel by the hand of one Neville as my neighbour here can testify  point∣ing to Wentworth  Wentworth  Such certainly was the information I received from my correspondent by the last mail from Paris  Clarissa  A mere affair of gallantry believe me and a slight scratch soon settled the business as these letters and papers will confirm  going up to gives letters and papers to Sir Jacob  You know the hand and seal Trimwell give this note to that gentleman  pointing to Went∣worth  then instantly go to Lowe's Hotel enquire after my letters I have ordered them to be directed there as well as those for my sister Clarissa Be care∣ful of them till my return which will not be long first  Exit  Clarissa going up to Flavia retire back  Sir Jacob  aside  As I suspected and the whole of neighbour Wentworth's foreign intelligence a cursed lie perhaps and my daughter engaged in two contracts at once I shall go distracted had she died in her cradle I had been happy But what say the letters  Opens and reads  Sir John  Do dear Wentworth explain for I am on the rack  Wentworth  The papers he has given Sir Jacob and my note will I presume unravel this whole mystery  Reads aside  Sir  Inform'd you were here and fearing I might not have one favourable moment of seeing you alone this entreats you not to leave me till that opportunity offers having something of consequence to communicate to you and you only  Yours MONTAGUE  What may this mean I think I may safety comply with the request  Sir Jacob  to Sir John  Why these papers Sir John prove the bearer to be no other than the very Montague my daughter was contracted to but the frippery airs dress and manners of a French court have so altered and  womaniz'd  him as a body may say I knew him not Your contract therefore shall be return'd you and you child may go in and say your prayers and thank Heaven in the confusion you are likely to have any hust and at all Either way I part with no money that's my com∣fort in the worst of ills  aside  Sir John  angrily to Sir Jacob  Insolent unfeeling old wretch But know young man  going up to Cla∣rissa  it shall not end here for he must win her first who wears her now and that from the point of my sword You may perhaps see me again Sir  Exit agitated  Flavia  to Wentworth anxiously  Let me prevail on you Sir to follow your friend and divert him if possible from a resolution I so feelingly dread being put in execution on this strange discovery whilst I retire  Wentworth  as she is going  Strange indeed madam but by waiting the event of matters I may be the better able perhaps to prevent any ill consequences  Exit Flavia  Clarissa  advancing forward  Well Sir Jacob have the letters and papers confirm'd me the living or the dead Montague contracted to your daughter  Sir Jacob  returning the papers  Living or dead I  wish you were safely in bed together that I might at once know the end of all my care and expence  Clarissa  I have an hundred pound bill  turning to Sir Jacob  Sir  taking it out of a pocketbook  I must get you to discount for me as the expence of travelling has taken away all my ready money and in London I am told we are oftener in want of small change than sums  Sir Jacob  The bill I suppose is good  Looking at it  Clarissa  As a French banker's credit with an Eng∣lish acceptance can make it  Sir Jacob  Well well I'll step to a neighbour's and see what I can do You pay the discount for I see it has three days to run  Clarissa  By all means Sir and your coachhire into the bargain  Sir Jacob  half going returns  I shall find you here at my return  Clarissa  Or at the Hotel in CoventGarden I am there for the present And in case of my absence it may be lest with my servant I believe him honest and may be trusted  Sir Jacob  aside as he is going  As my own strong box is my neighbour upon these occasions to walk to it and charge coachhire would be a stroke known hitherto only to lawyers  Populus me sibilat at mihi plaudo  Exit  Clarissa  Since the opportunity Sir now offers in me behold  pulling off her hat  Clarissa sister to the  living  Montague and learning you were here presumed on the long intimacy which subsisted between you and my late father to write the note my servant gave you  Wentworth  Ah is it possible Time and the little knowledge I had of you whilst in England and your present disguise I confess made me not recollect you  Clarissa  I must rely for the present on your secrecy and friendship  Wentworth  Rely on both Pray proceed  Clarissa  The death of my brother and his falling by the hands of Mr Neville were mere reports the first taking rise from a duel he was engaged in at Rome on an affair of honourable love and the latter from Mr Neville's sudden departure from Paris on the cool  reception his addresses to me met with from my brother who no sooner recovered and married the lady than my love for Neville returned and deter∣mined me to personate my brother and follow him here to England  Wentworth  And have you been successful in your pursuit  Clarissa  Being but just arrived I have not his leaving Paris without ever daring to bid me adieu I know not where he is  Wentworth  And pray what may be the steps you mean to take  Clarissa  To remain in this disguise by the help of which and the letters I have brought Sir Jacob will not suspect the deceit and I shall be the better able to make those enquiries after Mr Neville which in my own character as a woman might perhaps be thought indelicate Besides from a Chancery trust reposed in Sir Jacob was he to know of my design he would certainly use every art to prevent my ever marrying at all  Wentworth  I see your situation and from the deli∣cacy of it will give you every assistance possible You lodge at the Hotel you say  Clarissa  And the short time I mean to stay this dis∣guise will protect me Favor me with your company there and I'll explain more to you  Exeunt  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II SCENE I  Scene CoventGarden with a view of Lowe's Hotel  Trimwell coming out and walks about  Trimwell  NEVER sure was Hounslow posthorse more weary in going a double stage than I in waiting for this same master of mine After a journey to  take  some refreshment suits most travel∣lers yet he  takes  nothing here but his portmanteau and humble servant then instantly sets out to pay a visit to a covetous old dog of a miser who knowing persons of my rank and order are at boardwages would sooner see a stranger break his neck in his house than his fast I can bear this airy diet no longer I will e'en go and appease the angry tumults within by finding some diversion for my teeth  going stops  But who have we here  Enter Neville in a travellingdress followed by a Chair∣man with his portmanteau  Chairman  Arrah my dear master your portman∣teau is so mortal heavy and little Timsey has padded so far with it he must be after giving his shoulders a holiday awhile  setting it down  Neville  Let it be short then as I am going only to that Hotel  pointing  Chairman  Long or short if I am to be after carry∣ing it any further I must get a brother of the strap I believe to lend me a cast of his office by carrying it for me  Neville  seeing Trimwell  Apropos you seem at leisure honest friend do lend this chairman a hand with this portmanteau into that Hotel  pointing to it  whilst I discharge him  Trimwell  With pleasure Sir but as he is tired  had I not better lend him  two  when I am about it  takes up the portmanteau and carries it in  Neville  A clever fellow this Here Sir  pulls out his purse and gives money  Chairman  looking at it  Little Tim's not paid your honour  bowing  Neville  Here then friend  gives more money  Chairman  looking at it  Oh long life to your honour you could not give me less for carrying your wigbox and I am sure your portmanteau made little Timsey reel again  Neville  angrily  There then now are you paid  kicks him  Chairman  Arrah faith am I and  in full  and so your sarvent  looks at the money  O my jewel that little Timsey was but a jontleman to return the civi∣lity  Exit  Neville  The impositions of these fellows are into∣lerable  Trimwell returns  So friend you have done as I desired you  Trimwell  bowing  I have Sir  Neville  And pray what sort of a house is this  Trimwell  An excellent Hotel Sir I assure you Good beds handsome furniture a mancook and civil waiters lodging sit for an Ambassador at least  Neville  You are a servant I presume  Trimwell  It being my misfortune as it is that of many others to have the appetite of a gentleman without the estate I am and in my services Sir  clocklike  to be set agoing either backward or for∣ward at a master's pleasure  Neville  Have you been long a servant  Trimwell  Coming Sir of a running generation I have been of the trade ever since I could go  Neville  Indeed  Trimwell  Even so Sir My father was ticket∣porter to one of the inns of court my mother went out awashing and when withchild of me a few shirts being missing from one of her customers out of pure modesty she fairly run the country so that you see Sir I was born to my trade and have it by birth and education  Neville  Are you in want of a master then  Trimwell  At present I am SirAnd no lie either  aside  Neville  And I in want of a servant during my stay here which is uncertain Would you choose to engage  Trimwell  Most readilyFor who knows our's being but a travelling engagement my first master may mean to give me the slip  aside  What are your terms Sir  Neville  Three guineas amonth  Trimwell  I am your man Sir my name Trim∣well and the best recommendation  Neville  interrupting him  Is your countenance on which I shall depend without further enquiries Here's money Enquire at the lodge if there are any letters for Mr Neville whilst I step in and give some neces∣sary orders  Exit  Trimwell solus  Let me see three guineas amonth and a bachelor's sineture place No bad circumstance this of the port∣manteau I think times are pressing and behoves men of my industry to look about them And as for my young Parisian should he mean to resign me why Trimwell's provided for And now for the letters Neville I think is the name  Going meets Clarissa and Wentworth  Clarissa  Trimwell  Trimwell  Oh the devil here's my other master before I was aware of him  aside  Clarissa  surprized at seeing him  Where are you going I ordered you to wait at the Hotel  Trimwell  confused  True Sir but being impatient for your return I kept upon the lookout and chance directed me this way  Wentworth  aside  This fellow of hers is a shrewd one I warrant by the ease and air of his dialect  Clarissa  Go then and enquire if there are any letters for me or for my sister as I ordered you  Trimwell  Where pray Sir am I to bring them  Clarissa  To my apartments in the Hotel You will find us there  Exeunt Wentworth and Clarissa  Trimwell  as they are going  The devil I shall A  rare town this halfanhour ago I scarce knew whe∣ther I had any master at all or not and now I have two and both in a house What shall I do with them for they say there is no serving two And yet why not Double wages double meals are great spurs to invention Courage Trimwell and go exe∣cute both thy masters' orders at once  going  Enter Sir John Seymour  Sir John  aside as he enters  A lucky circumstance this for if I mistake not this is Montague's ser∣vant I saw at Sir Jacob's Pray friend where can I find your master  Trimwell returning  Trimwell  not recollecting him  In that Hotel Sir Which master now does he mean I wonder  aside  Sir John  Go tell him then a gentleman wishes to speak with him whom if he is a man of honour he will not refuse seeing  Trimwell  By his manner all is not right I fear I will excuse myself therefore carrying the message  aside  It being an Hotel Sir if you please to step in the servants of the house will obey any of your commands as I am in haste to execute some orders I have just receivedfrom  Sir John  angrily  No trifling Sir but go this moment with my message  Trimwell  You must know Sir my master is  Sir John  Shew me the way this instant sirrah or  Trimwell  aside  Go I must I see so I'll e'en take him to the first master I find This way Sir if you please  Exeunt into the Hotel  Scene an apartment in the Hotel Table and chairs Sir John Seymour alone agitated  No never shall a rival carry off my lovely Flavia I must not will not lose her and tho' this Mon∣tague may have escaped death in Paris he  Enter Trimwell introducing Neville  Trimwell  to Neville  There that's the gentleman Sir and now with your leave I'll step to enquire about the letters Indeed I believe I had better step  any where than wait the event of this business  aside  Exit  They walk about some time exchanging civility of hat c without speaking  Neville  Your commands with me Sir  Sir John  surprised  With you Sir I do not re∣collect I ever had the honour of seeing you before  Neville  I was informed by the servant Sir you earnestly desired to see me and spoke in terms which carried some resentment with them  Sir John  He misunderstood me then most exceed∣ingly Sir and I ask pardon for the mistake but the person I spoke of is his master who is a  eagerly  Neville  interrupting  I am his master Sir and am what  Sir John  You his master Sir  Neville  Yes I most certainly am Sir  Sir John  Why then Sir there is the strongest re∣semblance I ever saw between your servant and the servant of a gentleman just arrived from Paris  Neville  It is not long since I left that place my∣self Sir  Sir John  The name of the gentleman I want is Montague  Neville  I knew him well Sir  expressing concern  Sir John  As the affair then between us does not require secrecy that gentleman by virtue of a con∣tract now seeks to rob me of the only woman I adore and am myself contracted to  Neville  He will never then accomplish his design or interrupt your felicity Sir as I have been informed within this hour he died soon after I left that place  Sir John  Pardon me Sir but the report is totally groundless as I this morning saw him alive and well and Sir Jacob Thrift the lady's father has taken every possible method to be assured of his iden∣tity and by letters and other credentials it is now be∣yond a doubt And as you say you have some know∣ledge of him if you should chance to meet him be∣fore I see him let me intreat you to tell him that if he merits the hand he aspires to Sir John Sey∣mour expects to hear from him as a man of honour ought who glories in being his rival and hope my  situation will justify the liberty of the request I am now making Sir your servant  Exit  Neville  Sir your servant A strange adventure this I am actually lost in astonishment Montague recovered and now in England In either case I will instantly return to Paris on the wings of love to behold my charming Clarissa once more and prevail on her if possible to be mine for Sir John Seymour's situation is not more distressing than my own  musing  Enter Trimwell  Trimwell  Here Sir here is your  feeling in his pocket  Neville  interrupting  Trimwell will you go with me to Paris  Trimwell  When Sir  Neville  Instantly  Trimwell  What tonight Sir  Neville  No we will sleep first and set out by daybreak  Trimwell  I'm for a nap then first Sir if you please as I entirely agree with friend Sancho that he was a wise man who first invented sleep Here are your letters Sir  pulling out letters  But I have made a strange mistake I fear by putting both masters' letters into one pocket what shall I do I have it  aside  A brother liveryman Sir desired me to en∣quire at the same time for his master's letters but being all foreigners and I not understanding the lan∣guage be pleased Sir to examine and take what are for you  gives them  and  Neville  Ah what do I see a letter directed to Clarissa Montague and to be left at Lowe's Hotel till called forWhat can this mean I am in a maze Can she too be in England and I not know itWhere is the servant for whose master you had this letter what is his name and with whom does he live speak instantly  eagerly  Trimwell  confused and hesitates  His name Sir isisisRichardand he lives withwithI ne∣ver heard with whom Sir  bowing  Neville  Why how could you ask for his master's letters if you did not know his name  Trimwell  True SirWhat invention now  aside  Oh he wrote it down on a piece of paper Sir with a direction where to find him  Neville  Give me that paper  Trimwell  I have it not Sir I have lost it out of my pocketI  feeling for it confusedly  Neville  How then is this letter to be delivered if you do not know where to find him  Trimwell  On second thoughts SirI recollect he was to meet me in the Piazza and if you please to give me the letter I will go find him  Neville  No Trimwell this letter concerns me nearly and I am determined to open it  as if going to open it halfbreaks the seal and stops  And yet the indelicacy of such a step cannot be justified I will not there∣fore open it But charge you as you regard my hap∣piness and your own interest go find Richard in∣stantly and learn from him where he is to carry the letter  giving the letter  and be not long in your re∣turn as I expect a person with money which in case of my absence you must receive  Trimwell  Your commands shall be obeyed Sir But what excuse have I Sir for it's having the seal broke  Looking at it  Neville  I will reseal it  seals it  and if you but find Richard all will be well again and you amply re∣warded  Exit  Trimwell  Richard  stifling a laugh  He little thinks I believe this same Richard is no other than my other master to whom I will instantly go and de∣liver this letter  Exit  Scene changes to another apartment in the Hotel  Clarissa at a table writing  Enter Trimwell  Clarissa  Trimwell what has delay'd you thus have you enquired about my letters as I ordered you  Trimwell  I have Sir and received only this one  Clarissa  Looking at it  How's this a letter from Paris and seal'd with Neville's arms  rising  What can this mean It is not his hand If he is returned there I am utterly undone  Examining it  It has  been openedTo whom Sir have you betrayed the secrets of this letter  Trimwell  Open'd Sir It cannot be why it has never been out of my hands since I received it  Agitated  Clarissa  And are you hardy enough to deny it villain why look  Shewing it him  Trimwell  falling on his knees  On my knees kind Sir I entreat your forgiveness but there coming a letter also for me from an old withered relation of mine in the country who wrote a hand I never could read I applied to a civil goodnatured gentleman to read it for me and in my hurry gave him your letter for mine which he resealed the moment we disco∣vered the mistake  Clarissa  half aside  From the arms this civil gen∣tleman could certainly be no other than Neville himself And where pray did you meet this kind friend of yours  Trimwell  Atatat  Agitated  Clarissa  half aside  By the confusion of his answers I suspect his veracity However I'll go communicate the circumstances to Mr Wentworth and in my way call on Sir Jacob lest he discover my situation before I receive my money  Putting on her hat Exit  Trimwell  What a fortunate planet must I have been born under to have matters go on thus swim∣mingly Egad Trimwell if your masters will find you in belief you will find them in lies I warrant What an immense sum now should I be worth to a primeminister as a porter for I can outlie a cour∣tier a lover a chambermaid a milliner's apprentice a lawyer or even the newspapers at a general election  Enter Sir Jacob with the money in a bag endeavours to conceal it  Sir Jacob  Well Mr Gentleman is your honour's master within I have urgent business with him  Trimwell  aside  Which now of my honourable masters can old  Cent per Cent  want To be inqui∣sitive is the very badge of our office I'll sift him What pray Sir may be your business with him  Sir Jacob  That's no answer to my question Mr  Inquisitive My business is with him not with you therefore is he within or no I say  Trimwell  Unless I know your business Sir he is not within  Sir Jacob  aside  Oh the insolence of office But when I have told you my business will he be within then think you  Trimwell  Perhaps he mayif I like your business  Aside  Sir Jacob  Why then Mr PrimeMinister be pleased to tell your master I have brought the money and desire to know if he be within or no  Trimwell  aside  I'll e'en venture then to say no in order to give one or other of my masters a proof of my honesty should old Squaretoes dare trust me with it thereforeNo Sir my master's not within I assure you  Sir Jacob  Where can I find him  Trimwell  I know not it's a question we seldom ask each other when we go out  affectedly  Sir Jacob  And his return  Trimwell  Like my own uncertain  Sir Jacob  Are you honest  Trimwell  Tolerably so Who dare doubt it  Sir Jacob  Here then take this bag of an hundred pounds and be sure you give it him when he returns and tell him I have book'd the discount and charges  Trimwell  Yes Sir  eagerly  Sir Jacob  going returns  And yet notwithstand∣ing my commission it were prudent methinks not to leave it without a receipt the hangdog with his tolerable honesty may say he never received it  aside  So do you hear you can write I suppose Mr Gentleman'sgentleman  Trimwell  Write Sir  hesitating  Sir Jacob  Yes Sir write as I don't chuse to leave the money without a receipt  Trimwell  Oh you are perfectly right Sir and if you please I'll take the money in with me and bring a receipt ready wrote  Sir Jacob  But I do not chuse any such thing Sir or to part with you or the money out of my sight  without a receipt therefore come to the table and write one instantly  Trimwell sets down to write and appears embarrassed  Trimwell  It would be better worded Sir I should think if you would please to set down and write it and let me sign it  rising from the table  Sir Jacob  What blockhead you cannot write a receipt I suppose  Trimwell  whilst Sir Jacob sets down and writes  To be sure Sir joining with a few pounds shillings and pence was as far as I went in my education more in one of my cloth would have been pedantry  Sir Jacob  rising from the table  Here then  giving him the paper  let us see what sort of a scrawl you make  Trimwell sets down signs and returns it  There that will do and now dispose of it as your  tolerable honesty  or knavery best advises I care not  Exit  Trimwell  A fair wind to you old trader And I shall not find it a difficult matter I believe to per∣suade either of my young captains to receive your lading and pay the duty  Exit  Scene changes to Neville's apartment in the Hotel  Enter Neville followed by Trimwell  Neville  Well Trimwell have you been and found Richard as I ordered you  Trimwell  No Sir but I have found a much better thingthis bag of money You expected to receive some  Neville  Yes an hundred pounds  Trimwell  The money is certainly yours then Sir exactly the sum  Neville  And while I examine it I once more de∣sire you not to rest till you have found Richard  Goes to the table as if to examine it  Trimwell  I will feek him high and low Sir instantly  Neville  Do so  Trimwell  going  I am glad however the right owner has got the money  Aside Exit  Neville  putting up the money comes forward  How distressed and agitated has this circumstance of the letter made me Its being directed "to be left till  called for" makes every present search after her uncer∣tain and carries with it the appearance of a secresy most alarming What if I go to Sir Jacob's on the information received from Sir John By pretending business with her brother I may hear perhaps some∣thing of my Clarissa without my design being even suspected It shall be so  Exit  Scene Sir Jacob's house Enter Sir Jacob followed by Flavia and Robin  Sir Jacob  Blockhead how often have I told you I am never at home to men without names come to rob me perhaps I will not see him  Robin  He looks like no such sort of a  parson  Sir  Sir Jacob  Looks fool who trusts to looks nowadays when thieves sharpers and swindlers are as well drest as lords and courtiers on a birthday no no I will not see him  Flavia  Let me prevail on you Sir it may be somebody you'd wish to see  Sir Jacob  Well then if I mustdo you hear go shew him upBut be sure daughter you do not leave the room for tho' you cannot defend me your∣self you can scream and raise the house  Exit Robin  Flavia  Perhaps somebody from Mr Montague or Sir John  Sir Jacob  Whoever it is he's here to answer for himself I see  Enter Clarissa  Clarissa  You see Sir Jacob I use the freedom of a soninlaw already but money you know  Sir Jacob  Is soon parted with You have been at some gamingtable at the west end of the town I warrant and now come to take up more to carry to the same market  Clarissa  You I see Sir Jacob are taking upon you the authority of a fatherinlaw and by your prudent care have prevented my being guilty of the excesses you lay to my charge as you have not yet paid me my money  Sir 'Jacob  How not paid you that's pleasant  Clarissa  Rather serious Sir as my errand here  is  to receive it  Sir Jacob  Reckon fair if you never pay young gentleman Come come you have received it  Clarissa  I beg Sir to be rightly understood and when  I  say I have not received it a gentleman tells you so and am now come to receive it  Sir Jacob  That's being serious indeed but Sir to be as serious as you the money has been paid  Clarissa  That's a mistake or something worse Sir Jacob and permit me to say it has not been paid  Sir Jacob  I have debited your account  Clarissa  Then Sir if you have debited my account as you call it act like an honest man and let it be for value received  Enter Trimwell  Trimwell  I have been in quest of my master  Sir Jacob  runs up to Trimwell  There's the man I paid it to  Trimwell  Why what's the matter now old gentle∣man  Sir Jacob  Sirrah you have received the money I paid it you Where's my hundred pounds villain  Trimwell  Hundred pounds gone into a hundred hands by this time  Sir Jacob  TherethereI said soI paid it you by your master's orders  Trimwell  You paid it me by my master's order and by my master's order I paid it to my master  Sir Jacob  There I said I had a witness The thing is clear you see you have received it young gentle∣man  Clarissa  I received it what does all this mean Rascal  to Trimwell  have you paid me an hundred pounds  Trimwell  No Sir  Clarissa  Now Sir Jacob  Sir Jacob  Have not you paid it to your master  Trimwell  Yes Sir  Sir Jacob  Now Mr Montague  Clarissa  Have you paid it to me  Trimwell  I have not paid it to you Sir  Sir Jacob  Pay it back to me then  Trimwell  I have paid it to my master  Clarissa  half draws a sword  Will you persist villain in saying you have paid me  Trimwell  No Sirnot youI never meant itI never paid you a shilling  Sir Jacob  Robber Villain Plunderer where's my hundred pounds you have it you have given a receipt  collars Trimwell  You shall go before a ma∣gistrate there's one just by he owes me money and will hang you for nothing  Trimwell  If you will but let me speakdo spare my life SirI performed my trust like an honest man Sirand my master  Clarissa  Your master again Sir  Enter Tabby with Neville  Trimwell  No not

man out of his senses  Sir Jacob  You dog you have hurried me out of my money and I'll hurry you out of your life  Trimwell  I tell you Sirthat is the gentleman I paid the money to by your order  Sir Jacob  Did he pay you an hundred pounds  Neville  The fellow tells you truth  Trimwell  There you see Sir I always tell truth  significantly  Sir Jacob  Then it was my money he paid you  Clarissa  No

step I have taken convince you of my affection More I cannot at present communicate  Trimwell  So so my master is my mistress then at last  Aside  Tabby  My young lady would have been finely off in a husband I shall never trust to the evidence of my eyes or ears again I believe  Aside  Enter Wentworth and Sir John  Sir Jacob  eagerly  Here's a discovery neighbour Wentworth This same George Frederick Montague is a woman at last and her hopeful brother my in∣tended soninlaw alive and merry I fear  Wentworth  I knew it all Sir Jacob and came to en∣joy the  denouement  Sir Jacob  And what pray Sir John came you to enjoy  Sir John  The news my friend Wentworth in∣formed me ofyour intended soninlaw being married at Rome and hope every obstacle to your daughter's happiness and my own is now removed What say you my Flavia  going up to her  Flavia  If my father consents Sir the inclination of my heart is sufficiently known to you  Sir Jacob  How what Alive and married say you worse and worse  Clarissa  Even so believe me Sir Jacob  Sir Jacob  Alive or dead then it shall go hard but I'll recover on the contractBut you baggage you what a spirit you must have to adventure thusA woman

good Sir call me as many as you pleasethey are slight wounds and will break no bonesScoundrel and rascal are the familiar terms of society and friendship is a greatcoat we put off and on as best suits our conveniency But will not you kind Sir  to Neville  be pleased to be my advo∣cate upon this occasion and set this matter right  Neville  I certainly Sir Jacob received an hundred pound from him

the Bastile or in bed with a high sever  aside  Sir Jacob  How like a hangdog do you look have you nothing to say for yourself impostor  Trimwell  To be sure I have been a little unlucky in my services of today both in this moneybusiness and in the affair of the letters but as every thing seems likely to find it's right owner and no ill conse∣quences have happen'd I hope I shall be pardon'd by you Sir  to Neville  by you Sirthat is to say by you madam  to Clarissa  and by you good Sir  to Sir Jacob  Clarissa  Most readily your mistakes have made me the happiest of women  Neville  And me the happiest of men  Sir Jacob  And as I see I'm to lose nothing by it why I forgive you But you're a sad dog  Trimwell  Why Sir you must acknowledge I am as gentlemen go now a kind of a person with a shabby fort of genteel about me I told you truth about the  money and you see I have been serving but  one master  all this time  Sir John  There seems some honesty about the fellow after allSir Jacob may I now aspire to take your daughter's hand  Sir Jacob  Ay ay Here  joining their hands  I give it you with all my soul and if I recover hand∣somely on the contract I may perhaps find in my heart to
