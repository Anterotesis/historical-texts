ACT I  A Country View with an Inn  Enter Carlo  AIR  THO' up to th' ears in sore disasters  Poor servants must obey their masters  Still born to move at their command  Must neither lie nor sit nor stand  Nor speak nor think but as they're told  But headlong go  Thro' hail and rain  And frost and snow  Nor once complain  Tho' trembling quaking  Shiv'ring shaking  They catch their death with cold  'Tis now eight days since here we come▪  I thought to have been quite at home  But for a whim  To pleasure him  Slapdash am I sent back to Rome  But pleasures are his only guides  While I am bruis'd head back and sides  Having put up my horse my next care is to see after my master Signor Lelio who I dare say expects me with impatience 'Twas here I left himbut here he comes  Enter Lelio  Lelio  Ah Carlo I am glad thou art returned  Carlo  I don't doubt it Sir for you must have been in a thousand frights and fears But the portrait is found Sir 'tis found and all our cares are over  Lelio  coldly  Give it me  Carlo  There devour it with kisses  Seeing Lelio put the portrait in his pocket without regarding it  Heyday how you receive it  Lelio  As a thing become perfectly indifferent to me  Carlo  The devilwhy whence comes this change when Signor Ascorino your father gave it you at Naples zounds there was no keeping you within bounds you had your best bib and tucker on in a minute  Lelio  I confess it  Carlo  The character he had given you of Isabella and the sight of her picture had so sired you you must set out to Leghorn to see her that very moment  Lelio  All this is true  Carlo  It is indeed for away we decamped immediately from Naples and came posthaste here On our arrival you perceived you had left the portrait of Isabella at our inn at Rome so not daring to appear before her without it away I was dispatched as if the devil was in me  to fetch it I have brought it back to you and now you put it in your pocket without looking at it  Lelio  I agree to this I will even tell thee that impatient to see her so far from having the resolution to wait thy return the very day after thy departure I set out to her house though I had not the portrait  Carlo  I guess what followed The painter was remarkable for taking handsome likenesses I warrant you  Lelio  No I have not seen her On my way I met with a person who took away all my inclination  Carlo  A person  Lelio  Yes a very respectable person a young Gipsy who offered to tell me my fortune  Carlo  Oh I understand you She looked at your line of life and found there certain crosses something in the shape of horns  Lelio  No no Carlo 'twas in looking in my face she did the business not in my hand  Carlo  How do you mean  Lelio  That my heart was stolen by the charms of this beautiful Gipsy who appeared to be a divinity  Carlo  Oh some pilgrim I suppose who knows very well how to sell her cockleshells  Lelio  Thou art deceived she has not less wisdom than beauty Imagine to thyself all the attractions all the graces together this is Spinetta She receives your praises with an honest disdain and if you are too free she opposes to your vivacity an agreeable severity  Carlo  That's as much as to say she holds the sugarplumb as high as she can  Lelio  Alas why is not her birth equal to her merit  Carlo  That's right Signor Lelio push the matter further be a perfect hero in this business and persuade yourself she is some princess in disguise whose misfortunes have reduced her royal highness to stroll about the country to tell fortunes and steal pigs and chickens  Lelio  Truce to pleasantryI confess it agrees but little with my birth to have a passion so delicate for a Gipsy but I am so entirely conquerred that let what will be the consequence I can think of nothing but her and the means of pleasing her  AIR  Why am not I that fragrant flow'r  Near to her heart Spinetta plac'd  Which proudly living a sweet hour  Died on that bosom it had grac'd  Why am not I that gentle gale  Which plays around her coral lips  Her breath like violets to exhale  Which there eternal nectar sips  Why am not I that crystal wave  At sultry noon with pride which heav'd  To which her heav'nly form she gave  Which tho' 'twas Venus it receiv'd  Gods had I been the limpid stream  But whither do my senses rove  Sunk in a dear delicious dream  I would be all to please my love  Carlo  Oh brave And where does this wonderful creature live pray Sir  Lelio  Just here with a brother named Clarin an honest and worthy lad  Carlo  Oh like sister like brother I dare say  Lelio  And they are at the head of a band of Gipsies  Carlo  Who are also very honest no doubtZounds you are got into a great deal of very honest company since I left you  Lelio  Peace I see Spinetta coming this way with Laura her companionHow my heart beatsDraw aside a moment before we accost them  Lelio and Carlo retire  Enter Spinetta and Laura  Spin  Yes Laura Lelio pleases my brother▪ and I love him But that is not enough I must have every proof of his affection while he believes me a Gipsy 'twill be a painful trial but 'tis necessary  AIR  Love's a cheat we overrate it  A flatt'ring false deceitful joy  A very nothing can create it  A very nothing can destroy  The light'ning's flash which wond'ring leaves us  Obscur'd and darker than before  The glowworm's tinsel which deceives us  A painted light and nothing more  Laura  I approve your delicacy What joy for Lelio when he finds  Spin  Hush he's here Leave us  Exit Laura  Signor Lelio I was searching for you to bid you adieu  Lelio  How adieu  Spin  My brother is determined to leave Leghorn immediately  Lelio  Ah my dear Spinetta what frightful news and with what barbarous tranquility you tell it me  Spin  Would to Heaven I could be as indifferent as you think me but 'tis time to discover my sentiments I cannot depart without telling you that I am not insensible to your love  Lelio  I'll follow you to the end of the world  Carlo  The man's gone mad  Spin  No Lelio I forbid you After the confession I have made what must you think of me you must forget me  Carlo  Hang me if she is not a very sensible girl  Lelio  Alas I cannot Your cruel kindness has taken away every hope Let me follow you  Spin  My delicacy will not permit me  Carlo  The delicacy of a Gipsy Oh dear  smothering a laugh  Lelio  My life depends on it  Spin  And my virtue which is as dear to me as my life will not suffer me to let a man accompany me who is not my husband  Lelio  That shall be no objection  Carlo  The devil it sha'n't  Spin  The son of a nobleman marry a Gipsy  Carlo  Very true my little dear 'twould be a damn'd shame would not it  Lelio  Love confounds all ranks  Spin  Suppose I consented how would it look for you to put on the habit of a Gipsy and live like us  Lelio  How SpinettaSurely after you were my wife you would not think of continuing the state of life in which I see you at present  Spin  You are mistaken I cannot resolve either to quit my brother or his fortune we must therefore part 'Tis a cruel stroke but Fate will have it so Besides how can I flatter myself that your love is any other than the effect of youth and vivacity  AIR  Praise is a mirror that flatters the mind  That tells us of goodness and virtues and graces  As that on our toilet instructs us to find  The dimples and smiles which appear on our faces  To which our attention we cannot refrain  Tho' we draw off confus'd yet but see its attraction  In spite of ourselves we return back again  Regard are abus'd and receive satisfaction  I know I'm deceiv'd and I say to my heart  You believe that sincere which is nought but profusion  Call pleasure what soon will severe make you smart  And hug that for a substance you'll find but delusion  Your praises are flatt'ry I know it as plain  As if you had said "I am false and deceive you"  But truth reason every thing argues in vain  For such is my weakness I blush and believe you  Exit  Carlo  This is all very well Now Sir I suppose I must go to Isabella and announce your arrival must not I  Lelio  I'll marry her  Carlo  Isabella Sir  Lelio  Spinetta blockhead  Carlo  Oh Lord Sir all the court of Naples will be charm'd to hear what an honourable choice you have made  Lelio  Say another word and I'll  drawing his sword  Carlo  upon his knees  Dear Sir I beg your pardon You are right perfectly right Sir please yourself get little Gipsies and let the world talk and be hang'd  Lelio  Alas Carlo instead of insulting me with railleries and reproaches pity me rather Do you believe I yield without remorse to this passion no 'tis impossible to describe the conflicts in my mind betwixt reason and love  Reenter Spinetta  Spin  Well Lelio I have consulted my brother and he thinks as I do that we ought to part and is coming to bid you adieu  Lelio  No Spinetta I can never part with you I consent to all you ask  in pronouncing these last words he pulls out his handkerchief and drops the portrait of Isabella Carlo picks it up and endeavours to hide it  Spin  What's that  Carlo  Nothing at all  Spin  I suspect something and will see  snatching  it out of Carlo's hand  Ah 'tis a portrait and of a very pretty woman too  Carlo  Lord 'tis only the portrait of his grandmama when she was in her teens  Spin  You seem uneasy Lelio What ought I to think of this  Lelio  Don't judge too rashly hear me a moment  Spin  I'll hear nothing  Lelio  Let me undeceive you  Spin  I am undeceived  Carlo  Nay hang it Madam Gipsy you are a little unreasonable this bout to refuse to hear is not the way to know the truth Let me get between you and I'll set the matter to rights in a moment  When he sings  to Lelio  he imitates Spinetta and when  to Spinetta  he imitates Lelio  AIR  What villainous trick you inconstant young log  To pass on me thus do you mean  To Lelio  None at all or may I be hang'd like a dog  My pretty Egyptian queen  To Spin  Then tell me what slamekin's picture is this  Which out of your pocket you drew  To Lelio  'Tis a cousin I've left I swear't by this kiss  Attempts to kiss Spin  To run round the country with you  To Spin  You're in love with her then and shall I but have part  Your nasty eyes out I could claw  To Lelio  No beautiful flow'r of that garden my heart  Isabella I never yet saw  To Spin  Were I certain indeed that 'tis true what you say  And that this is not one of your  nimps  To Lelio  'Tis true love or may I be taken away  By the devil and all his imps  To Spin  This being the case your anger abates and then you kiss and are friends  Lelio  He tells you the truth  Spin  This I must search into  Lelio  I desire no better  Enter Clarin  Clarin  Signor Lelio I comebut you seem moved both of you have you any cause of dispute  Spin  Yes brother and this is the subject Lelio dropt a portrait which he says is that of a cousin he has never seen and to whom he was to have been married  Clarin  Heavens 'tis the portrait of Isabella And do you really prefer my sister to so much beauty  Lelio  Was my cousin a thousand times handsomer I would make her that sacrifice with pleasure  Clarin  And for me I would prefer your cousin to all the women I ever saw  Lelio  You prefer my cousin What does he mean  Clarin  Your astonishment will cease when I inform you I have seen your cousin that I had the good fortune to do her a material service that I have resolved to pay my addresses to her and that this habit only has prevented me from having had a second interview with her  Spin  But that obstacle is now removed and you may see her whenever you chuse if Signor Lelio will consent to it  Lelio  Who meyou joke Spinetta  Spin  Not at all as you have never seen your cousin my brother may very easily pass for you  Lelio  For me it can't be  Spin  Why not he need but have the portrait to introduce him he can deport himself like a gentleman I assure you Sir nor will Isabella have any suspicion of the trick  Lelio  A man of the calling of your brother I can't consent to it  Carlo  Nor I neither Damn me they have a design against the whole familyWould you wish Ma'am that any body should marry his father he is devilish rich I assure you  Spin  Well what do you say Lelio  Lelio  Don't oblige me Spinetta to represent to you the absurdity of this project  Spin  Your resistance betrays you Lelio You've an attachment for Isabella  Lelio  'Tis not that you take that for the effect of love which is only a principle of honour The disparagement is too great a lady of quality marry a Gipsy  Carlo  Oh ho you begin to feel it now  Spin  Say no more I exact nothing from you Keep your noble pride you have need of it yourself I would have abandoned for you the greatest princes upon earth and you are always refusing every thing I request of you  Lelio  But consider  Spin  Go ungrateful you don't merit the heart of Spinetta Leave me and vaunt to Isabella  your scrupulous attention to her honour She'll pardon the contempt you have had for her charms Come my brotherAdieu noble Lelio If you think your cousin ought to disdain a Gipsy such as my brother believe me a Gipsy such as I am can disdain you in her turn  AIR  Go proud lover go  Take your heart back again  For me 'tis too low  Too unworthy a chain  Be haughty imperious this Gipsy despise  You rise but to fall while I fall to rise  True love never erring  Has no selfish fears  That the more 'tis conferring  The nobler appears  It has no sordid views no vile ends for its guide  'Tis ungovern'd by int'rest uninfluenc'd by pride  Exe Spin and Clarin  Carlo  What a devil of a spirit she has  Lelio  I'll persist even if I lose her  Carlo  That's right Sir  Lelio  I'll after and reason her out of her absurd folly  Carlo  Zounds Sir don't go to spoil all  Lelio  Never fear I'll represent to her the extravagance of such an idea  Carlo  Ah that's as much as to say you'll consent to whatever she pleas  s  Lelio  No no this has waked my senses out  of the lethargy in which they have been entrancedStay here while I bid her adieu for ever  AIR  Yes yes thank Heaven I've broke my chain  And while my liberty I gain  While I my heart redeem  Indifference succeeds at last  And my egregious follies past  Appear an idle dream  Thus from a perfidious snare  The linnet timid unaware  Hardly escapes with pain  The feathers he has left behind  Are lesson to him to remind  Not to be caught again  The warrior bravely counts each scar▪  Describes the peril of the war  Well  leas'd his danger's o'er  The slave at last exempt from pain  With smiles beholds that very chain  Which held him to the oar  Exit  Enter Laura  Carlo  A noble resolution and couragiously taken What a pity 'tis that one hypocritical tear should overturn itThe devil fly away with all the Gipsies upon earth I say  Laura  I thank you for the body in general and myself in particular  Carlo  You are welcome my dear if it was ten times as much  Laura  Then this Gipsy's dress that I have brought for you I may take back again  Carlo  You may indeed  Laura  And why so  Carlo  Because I am not in love  Laura  Oh your time will come never fearLet me see  Taking his hand  Carlo  Come come don't be palming of me and looking at my line of lifeI wish I may never stir if I an't afraid of her  Laura  You  are  in love  Carlo  Oh I am With who pray  Laura  With me  Carlo  With youShe's devilish handsome for the matter of thatzounds if I should get bewitched too  Laura  What's the matter with you  Carlo  I am considering  Laura  Considering what  Carlo  That it is not honest for a man to abandon his master  Laura  That's a good lad  Carlo  And that I am afraid you had some secret way of making my heart come out of my fingers' ends just now for I wish I may die if I have not lost it  Laura  Did not I tell you so  Carlo  I feel myself already almost as great fool as my master  Laura  And that's saying a great deal  Carlo  'Tis done I sacrifice my aunt my cousin my grandmother and all the whole shop  Laura  What a happy woman am I  Carlo  Yes we'll go and leap over the stick as soon as you pleaseBut all that troubles me is how the devil you do to tell peoples' fortunes  Laura  Oh there's nothing in the world so easy  AIR  When we promise an heir or a miser  This  gold  that  his father's free land  We pause and look grave to seem wiser  And his fortune read in his hand  If Miss at fifteen would discover  When she'll like her mother be wise  To promise a handsome young lover  Her fortune we read in her eyes  But if husbands with jealousy quaking  Would know if they areyou know how  We considerour heads gravely shaking  And their fortunes read on the brow  Carlo  So according to this I have only to tell a married woman her husband will die before her a young girl that she'll soon get married a physician that he'll have a great many patients a poet that all his pieces will succeed and in short what I think will please them bestBut what's all this  Laura  Our joyous band who are coming to perform the accustomed ceremonies upon receiving your master and you into the company  Carlo  Really the company do us a great deal of honour

Now for me And will the amiable Laura first lady of honour to the princess Matilda deign to cast a twinkle of affection upon the lovestricken Carlo as lord of the bedchamber  Laura  As you have followed the example of your master I think I cannot do better than imitate my mistress  FINALE  Isab  Our vessel has its port in view  If here no hov'ring tempest lours  We've others' fortune toldbut you  Must be the arbiters of ours  Do not our wishes disapprove  But let them have their freest scope  Our piece has the effects of love  For subject and for moralhope  Lelio  Hope scorns misfortunes the most rude  With hope the veriest wretch is blest  And poets write that every good  Is betterhop'd forthan possess'd  Hope cheers the most dejected hearts  Can ev'n despair itself controul  'Tis on that course the lover starts  Of his desires to reach the goal  Spin  Of sand a poor neglected grain  Bewailing did its fortune curse  "I am the vilest atom lain  "Upon the face o'th' universe"  But succouring heat and fruitful show'rs  This atom to a diamond brings  And now in brilliant pride it tow'rs  Upon the heads of Persia's kings  Carlo  Thus the effects of hope we preach  But words alas are empty air  For while that height we fain would reach  Your frowns would sink us to despair  One kind resounding cane or hand  To flatt'ring hope gives instant birth  Applause will raise our humble band  And give the Gipsies real worth  FINIS
