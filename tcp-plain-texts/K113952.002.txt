PaternosterRow MDCCLXIII  THE POETICAL CALENDAR  ODE TO FEBRUARY  WIth wreath of yellow crocus bound  See furrclad February creep  His beard with snow is silver'd o'er  Which still invests the hoary ground  Two dolphins wait him on the deep  And as they once Arion bore  Invite him to serener skies  Where the delighted springbird flies  But he intent to prune and plant  And throw his seeds around the soil  With decent grace the boon resigns  Lest autumn's treasures should be scant  Thence he renews his daily toil  And trims with care the tender vines  From rust he wipes his crooked knife  And gives the infant sap new life  Now earlier with her golden key  Aurora hastens to the east  And later now advances night  To draw her mantle o'er the day  Suspending the nocturnal feast  Diana sooner hails the light  And hark the jolly huntsman's horn  With sprightly note salutes the morn  What are the checquer'd months to me  Or if they lower or if they shine  So Myra but approves my flame  Throb not my heart be calm and free  For yonder comes old Valentine  The feather'd songsters shall proclaim  His festival with blither note  And dress anew their bridal coat  To Myra I enclos'd my heart  Each letter bore an ardent vow  St Valentine the thought inspir'd  And wrote the verse with Cupid's dart  Next morning with serener brow  She own'd her melting bosom fir'd  And gave her every charm to join  The avison of Valentine  W  STANZAS OCCASIONED BY THE FORWARDNESS OF THE SPRING  O'ER nature's fresh bosom by verdure unbound  Bleak winter blooms lovely as spring  Rich flowerets how fragrant rise wantonly round  And summer's wing'd choristers sing  To greet the young monarch of Britain's blest isle  The groves with gay blossoms are grac'd  The primrose peeps forth with an innocent smile  And cowslips crowd forward in haste  Dispatch gentle Flora the nymphs of your train  Thro' woodlands to gather each sweet  Then rob of its roses the dewspangled plain  And strew the gay spoils at his feet  Two chaplets of lawrel in verdure the same  For George O ye virgins entwine  From conquest's own temples these evergreens came  And those from the brows of the nine  What glories ye Britons one emblem implies  Shall to your lov'd monarch belong  What Miltons the other what Drydens arise  To make him immortal in song  To a wreath of fresh oak England's emblem of power  Whose honours with time shall increase  Add a fair olivesprig just unfolding its flower  Rich token of concord and peace  Next give him young myrtles by beauty's brigh queen  Collected the pride of her grove  How fragrant their odour their foliage how green  Sweet promise of conjugal love  Let Gaul's captive lillies cropt close from the ground  As trophies of conquest be tied  The virgins all cry"There's not one to be found  " Outbloom'd by his roses they died"  Ye foes of old England such fate shall ye share  With George as our glories advance  Thro' envy you'll sickenyou'll droopyou'll despair  And die like the lillies of France  SPRING ADDRESSED TO MYRA  AGain the circling sun in Pisces  The sign in the Zodiac which the sun occupies in February  rides  And up the steep of heaven his coursers guides  Stern winter stalks with sullen pace away  And night resigns her empire to the day  Now various beauty from the teeming earth  Awakes to life and rises into birth  Now floods from frost unbound spontaneous flow  The scaly breed now vig'rous sport below  New life the vernal sun diffusing wide  New life now quickens in the glassy tide  That life alas to fatal wilds a prey  The same soft season gives and takes away  The fishers now the specious bait apply  And unsuspected glides the mimic fly  Meanwhile the passing cloud and transient shower  Dim the clear mirror in a faithless hour  Thro' the false medium now the fry behold  The glittering wings mistook for native gold  Each springs impatient of the gawdy prize  And each grown wise too late repenting dies  Take heed ye fair by this example taught  Such are the wiles by which your sex is caught  In spring's soft season with most caution trust  If men are faithless to yourselves be just  Superior beauty now adorns the skies  Bright and more bright the vernal mornings rise  Now Kenna's  The snowdropSee Tickel's poem on Kensington gardens  love fair Albion's silver flower  In modest white adorns the genial hour  The lovely leader of the flowery race  The first in honour and the first in place  With these Pomona's blooming train appear  Sweet pledge of plenty to the closing year  Soft Zephyr's breath and kind prolific rains  With various hues and fragrance fill the plains  All all rejoice with nature in her prime  And pleasure wings the feather'd feet of time  Will gentle Myra listen while I sing  Wishful to join the music of the spring  By thee alone kind nature can bestow  One heartfelt joy that here I wish to know  Thy smile dispenses all that spring can give  For not to live with hope is not to live  ON THE FIRST OF FEBRUARY BEING THE BIRTHDAY OF A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY  LAst of the dreary winter's train  Hail February hail  In thee the swains salute again  The habitable vale  Call forth amidst the leafless glades  Thy crocuses and  Snowdrops in Suffolk are called fairmaids of February  fairest maids  From out thy springexpecting bowers  Or else an honour more divine  Around thy brows my nymph shall twine  Her artificial flowers  The smile of May the laugh of June  And autumn's joy fullblown  In rapture shall thy rough blasts tune  For Nancy was thy own  With beauty built upon her bloom  With sweets deriv'd from her perfume  You brave the forward charms of spring  Since author of so sweet a toast  The year no brighter gem can boast  In all its circling ring  HORACE ODE IV BOOK I IMITATED  NOW iceforming winter is melted away  And gentle Favonius refreshes the day  Spring sweetly in dimples now smiles on the streams  And wherries sail light on the bosom of Thames  No longer the cattle warm cover require  The lubber no longer hangs over the fire  No longer in snow the green meadows are lost  And the fields are disarm'd of their breastplate of frost  At noon the gay ladies like so many graces  In the Park if the sun shines display their fair faces  But so languid a lustre the sun now supplies  'Tis excell'd far excell'd by the ladies bright eyes  With wreaths of fresh flowers let us cover our heads  Crocus snowdrop and primrose that grow in the meads  But if in the meadows fresh flowerets are rare  Our soldiers have plenty of laurels to spare  St Valentine bids us be jovial and gay  And finish with wine love and friendship the day  Fill fill the large bowl and let enmity cease  Let us drink the king's health who has crown'd us with peace  Life is short and grim death alike knocks at the door  Of the monarch's proud dome and the cot of the poor  Let us live then nor longer procrastinate bliss  When we're dead we shall drink no such liquor as this  DEITY A POEM  BY THE LATE MR SAMUEL BOYSE  FRom earth's low prospects and deceitful aims  From wealth's allurements and ambition's dreams  The lover's raptures and the hero's views  All the false joys mistaken man pursues  The schemes of science the delights of wine  Or the more pleasing follies of the Nine  Recall fond bard thy long enchanted sight  Deluded with the visionary light  A nobler theme demands thy sacred song  A theme beyond or man's or angel's tongue  A theme that should the noblest warmth impart  To animate the soul and warm the heart  But oh alas unhallow'd and profane  How shalt thou dare to raise the heavenly strain  Do thou who from the altar's living fire  Isaiah's tuneful lips didst once inspire  Come to my aid celestial spirit come  From my dark mind dispel the dubious gloom  My passions still my purer breast inflame  To sing that God from whom existence came  Till heaven and nature in the concert join  And own the author of their birth divine  I ETERNITY  Whence sprung this glorious frame or whence arose  The various forms the universe compose  From what almighty cause what mystic springs  Shall we derive the origin of things  Sing heavenly guide whose allefficient light  Drew dawning planets from the womb of night  Since reason by thy sacred dictates taught  Adores a power beyond the reach of thought  First cause of causes sire supreme of birth  Sole light of heaven acknowledg'd life of earth  Whose word from nothing call'd this beauteous whole  This wideexpanded all from pole to pole  Who shall prescribe the boundary to thee  Or fix the aera of eternity  Should we deceiv'd by error's sceptic glass  Admit the thought absurdthat nothing was  Thence would this wild this false conclusion flow  That nothing rais'd this beauteous all below  When from disclosing darkness splendor breaks  Associate atoms move and matter speaks  When nonexistence bursts its close disguise  How blind are mortalsnot to own the skies  If one vast void eternal held its place  Whence started time or whence expanded space  What gave the slumbering mass to feel a change  Or bid consenting worlds harmonious range  Could nothing link the universal chain  No 'tis impossible absurd and vain  Here reason its eternal author finds  The whole who regulates unites and binds  Enlivens matter and produces minds  Inactive chaos sleeps in dull repose  Nor knowledge thence nor free volition flows  A nobler source those powers etherial show  By which we think design reflect and know  These from a cause superior date their rise  " Abstract in essence from material tyes"  An origin immortal as supreme  From whose pure day celestial rays they came  In whom all possible perfections shine  Eternal selfexistent and divine  From this great spring of uncreated might  This allresplendent orb of vital light  Whence all created beings take their rise  Which beautify the earth or paint the skies  Profuselywide the boundless blessings flow  Which heaven enrich and gladden worlds below  Which are no less when properly defin'd  Than emanations of th' eternal mind  Hence triumphs truth beyond objection clear  Let unbelief attend and shrink with fear  That what for ever wasmust surely be  Beyond commencement and from period free  Drawn from himself his native excellence  His date eternal and his space immense  And all of whom that man can comprehend  Is that he ne'er begun nor e'er shall end  In him from whom existence boundless flows  Let humble faith its sacred trust repose  Assur'd on his eternity depend  " Eternal father and eternal friend"  Within that mystic circle safety seek  No time can weaken and no force can break  And lost in adoration breathe his praise  High rock of ages antient sire of days  II UNITY  Thus recogniz'd the spring of life and thought  Eternal selfderiv'd and unbegot  Approach celestial muse th' empyreal throne  And awfully adore th' exalted one  In nature pure in place supremely free  And happy in essential unity  Bless'd in himself had from his forming hand  No creatures sprung to hail his wide command  Bless'd had the sacred fountain ne'er run o'er  A boundless sea of bliss that knows no shore  Nor sense can two bright origins conceive  Nor reason two eternal Gods believe  Could the wild Manichaean own that guide  The good would triumph and the ill subside  Again would vanquish'd Arimanius bleed  And darkness from prevailing light recede  In different individuals we find  An evident disparity of mind  Hence ductile thought a thousand changes gains  And actions vary as the will ordains  But should two beings equally supreme  Divided power and parted empire claim  How soon would universal order cease  How soon would discord harmony displace  Eternal schemes maintain eternal fight  Nor yield supported by eternal might  Where each would uncontrol'd his aim pursue  The links dissever or the chain renew  Matter from motion cross impressions take  As serv'd each power his rival's power to break  While neutral chaos from his deep recess  Would view the neverending strife increase  And bless the contest which secur'd his peace  Or new creations would opposing rise  With elemental war to blot the skies  And round wild uproar and confusion hurl'd  Would veil the heavens and waste the ruin'd world  Two independent causes to admit  Destroys religion and debases wit  The first by such an anarchy undone  The last acknowledges its source but one  As from the main the mountain rills are drawn  That wind irriguous thro' the flowery lawn  So mindful of their spring one course they keep  Exploring till they find their native deep  Exalted power invisible supreme  Thou sovereign sole unutterable name  As round thy throne thy flaming seraphs stand  And as they touch the lyre with trembling hand  Too weak thy pure effulgence to behold  With their rich plumes their dazzled eyes infold  Transported with the ardors of thy praise  The holy holy holy anthem raise  To them responsive let creation sing  Thee indivisible eternal king  III SPIRITUALITY  O say celestial muse whose purer birth  Disdains the low material ties of earth  By what bright images shall be defin'd  The mystic nature of th' eternal mind  Or how shall thought the dazzling height explore  Where all that reason canis to adore  That God's an immaterial essence pure  Whom figure can't describe nor parts immure  Incapable of passions impulse fear  In good preeminent in truth severe  Unmix'd his nature and sublim'd his powers  From all the gross allay which tempers ours  In whose clear eye the bright angelic train  Appear suffus'd with imperfection's stain  Impervious to the man'sor seraph's eye  Beyond the ken of each exalted high  Him would in vain material semblance feign  Or figur'd shrines the boundless God contain  Object of faithhe shuns the view of sense  Lost in the blaze of sightless excellence  Most perfect most intelligent most wise  In whom the sanctity of pureness lies  In whose adjusting mind the whole is wrought  Whose form is spirit and whose essence thought  Are truths inscrib'd by wisdom's brightest ray  In characters that gild the face of day  Reason confess'd howe'er we may dispute  Fix'd boundary discovers man from brute  But dim to us exerts its fainter ray  Depress'd in matter and allied to clay  In forms superior kindles less confin'd  Whose dress is aether and whose substance mind  Yet all from him supreme of causes flow  To him their powers and their existence owe  From the bright cherub of the noblest birth  To the poor reasoning glowworm plac'd on earth  From matter then to spirit still ascend  Thro' spirit still refining higher tend  Pursue on knowledge bent the pathless road  Pierce thro' infinitude in quest of God  Still from thy search the centre still shall fly  Approaching stillthou never shalt come nigh  So its bright orb th' aspiring flame would join  But the vast distance mocks the fond design  If he almighty whose decree is fate  Could to display his power subvert his state  Bid from his plastic hand a greater rise  Produce a master and resign his skies  Impart his incommunicable flame  The mystic number of th' eternal name  Then might revolting reason's feeble ray  Aspire to question God's allperfect day  Vain task the clay in the directing hand  The reason of its form might so demand  As man presume to question his dispose  From whom the power he thus abuses flows  Here point fair muse the worship God requires  The soul inflam'd with chaste and holy fires  Where love celestial warms the happy breast  Where from sincerity the thought's express'd  Where genuine piety and truth refin'd  Reconsecrate the temple of the mind  With grateful flames the living altars glow  And God descends to visit man below  IV OMNIPRESENCE  Thro' the unmeasurable tracts of space  Go muse divine and present godhead trace  See where by place uncircumscrib'd as time  He reigns extended and he shines sublime  Should'st thou above the heaven of heavens ascend  Could'st thou below the depth of depths descend  Could thy fond flight beyond the starry sphere  The radiant morning's lucid pinions bear  There should his brighter presence shine confess'd  There his almighty arm thy course arrest  Could'st thou the thickest veil of night assume  Or think to hide thee in the central gloom  Yet there all patient to his piercing sight  Darkness itself would kindle into light  Not the black mansions of the silent grave  Nor darker hell from his perception save  What power alas thy footsteps can convey  Beyond the reach of omnipresent day  In his wide grasp and comprehensive eye  Immediate worlds on worlds unnumber'd lie  Systems inclos'd in his idea roll  Whose allinforming mind directs the whole  Lodg'd in his view their certain ways they know  Plac'd in that sight from whence can nothing go  On earth his footstool fix'd in heaven his seat  Enthron'd he dictatesand his word is fate  Nor want his shining images below  In streams that murmur or in winds that blow  His spirit broods along the boundless flood  Smiles in the plain and whispers in the wood  Warms in the genial sun's enlivening ray  Breathes in the air and beautifies the day  Steals on our footsteps wheresoe'er we go  And yields the purest joys we taste below  Should man his great immensity deny  Man might as well usurp the vacant sky  For were he limited in date or view  Thence were his attributes imperfect too  His knowledge power his goodness all confin'd  And lost the notion of a ruling mind  Feeble the trust and comfortless the sense  Of a defective partial providence  Boldly might then his arm injustice brave  Or innocence in vain his mercy crave  Dejected virtue lift its hopeless eye  And deep distress pour out the heartless sigh  An absent God no abler to defend  Protect or punish than an absent friend  Distant alike our wants or griefs to know  To ease the anguish or prevent the blow  If he supreme director were not near  Vain were our hope and empty were our fear  Unpunish'd vice would o'er the world prevail  And unrewarded virtue toilto fail  The moral world a second chaos turn  And nature for her great supporter mourn  Even the weak embryo ere to life it breaks  From his high power its slender texture takes  While in his book the various parts inroll'd  Increasing own eternal wisdom's mould  Nor views he only the material whole  But pierces thought and penetrates the soul  Ere from the lips the vocal accents part  Or the faint purpose dawns within the heart  His steady eye the mental birth perceives  Ere yet to us the new idea lives  Knows what we sayere yet the words proceed  And ere we form th' intention marks the deed  But conscience fair vicegerentlight within  Asserts its author and restores the scene  Points out the beauty of the govern'd plan  " And vindicates the ways of God to man"  Then sacred muse by the vast prospect fir'd  From heaven descended as by heaven inspir'd  His allenlightening omnipresence own  Whence first thou feel'st thy dwindling presence known  His wide omniscience justly grateful sing  Whence thy weak science prunes its callow wing  And bless th' eternal allinforming soul  Whose sight pervades whose knowledge fills the whole  V IMMUTABILITY  As the eternal and omniscient mind  By laws not limited nor bounds confin'd  Is always independent always free  Hence shines confess'd immutability  Change whether the spontaneous child of will  Or birth of forceis imperfection still  But he allperfect in himself contains  Power selfderiv'd for from himself he reigns  If alter'd by constraint we could suppose  That God his fix'd stability should lose  How startles reason at a thought so strange  What power can force omnipotence to change  If from his own divine productive thought  Were the yet stranger alteration wrought  Could excellence supreme new rays acquire  Or strong perfection raise its glories higher  Absurdhis high meridian brightness glows  Never decreases never overflows  Knows no addition yields to no decay  The sacred blaze of inexhaustless day  Below thro' different forms does matter range  And life subsists from elemental change  Liquids condensing shapes terrestrial wear  Earth mounts in fire and fire dissolves in air  While we enquiring phantoms of a day  Inconstant as the shadows we survey  With them along time's rapid current pass  And haste to mingle with the parent mass  But thou eternal Lord of life divine  In youth immortal shalt for ever shine  No change shall darken thy exalted name  From everlasting ages still the same  If God like man his purpose could renew  His laws could vary or his plans undo  Desponding faith would droop its cheerless wing  Religion deaden to a lifeless thing  Where could we rational repose our trust  But in a power immutable as just  How judge of revelation's force divine  If truth unerring gave not the design  Where as in nature's fair according plan  All smiles benevolent and good to man  Plac'd in this narrow clouded spot below  Darkly we see around and darkly know  Religion lends the salutary beam  That guides our reason thro' the dubious gleam  Till sounds the hourwhen he who rules the skies  Shall bid the curtain of omniscience rise  Shall dissipate the mists that veil our sight  And show his creaturesall his ways are right  Then when astonish'd nature feels its fate  And fetter'd time shall know its latest date  When earth shall in the mighty blaze expire  Heaven melt with heat and worlds dissolve in fire  The universal system shrink away  And ceasing orbs confess th' almighty sway  Immortal he amidst the wreck secure  Shall sit exalted permanently pure  As in the sacred bush shall shine the same  And from the ruin raise a fairer frame  VI OMNIPOTENCE  Far hence ye visionary charming maids  Ye fancied nymphs that haunt the Grecian shades  Your birth who from conceiving fiction drew  Your selves producing phantoms as untrue  But come superior muse divinely bright  Daughter of heaven whose offspring still are light  O condescend celestial sacred guest  To purge my sight and consecrate my breast  While I presume omnipotence to trace  And sing that power who peopled boundless space  Thou present wert when forth th' Almighty rode  While chaos trembled at the voice of God  Thou saw'st when o'er th' immense his line he drew  When nothing from his word existence knew  His word that wak'd to life the vast profound  While conscious light was kindled at the sound  Creation fair surpriz'd th' angelic eyes  And sovereign wisdom saw that all was wise  Him sole almighty nature's book displays  Distinct the page and legible the rays  Let the wild sceptic his attention throw  To the broad horizon or earth below  He finds thy soft impression touch his breast  He feels the Godand owns him unconfess'd  Should the stray pilgrim tir'd of sands and skies  In Lybia's waste behold a palace rise  Would he believe the charm from atoms wrought  Go atheist hence and mend thy juster thought  What hand almighty architect but thine  Could give the model of this vast design  What hand but thine adjust th' amazing whole  And bid consenting systems beauteous roll  What hand but thine supply the solar light  For ever wasting yet for ever bright  What hand but thine the azure convex spread  What hand but thine trace out the ocean's bed  To the vast main the sandy barrier throw  And with that feeble curb restrain the foe  What hand but thine the wintry flood asswage  Or stop the tempest in its wildest rage  Thee infinite what finite can explore  Imagination sinks beneath thy power  Thee could the ablest of thy creatures know  Lost were thy unity for he were Thou  Yet present to all sense thy power remains  Reveal'd in nature nature's author reigns  In vain would error from conviction fly  Thou every where art present to the eye  The sense how stupid and the sight how blind  That fails this universal truth to find  Goall the sightless realms of space survey  Returning trace the planetary way  The sun that in his central glory shines  While every planet round his orb inclines  Then at our intermediate globe repose  And view yon lunar satellite that glows  Or cast along the azure vault thy eye  When golden day enlightens all the sky  Around behold earth's variegated scene  The mingling prospects and the flowery green  The mountain's brow the long extended wood  Or the rude rock that threatens o'er the flood  And say are these the wild effects of chance  Oh strange effect of reasoning ignorance  Nor power alone confess'd in grandeur lies  The glittering planet or the painted skies  Equal the elephant's or emmet's dress  The wisdom of omnipotence confess  Equal the cumb'rous whale's enormous mass  With the small insect in the crouded grass  The mite that gambols in its acid sea  In shape a porpus tho' a speck to thee  Even the blue down the purple plum surrounds  A living world thy failing sight confounds  To him a peopled habitation shows  Where millions taste the bounty God bestows  Great lord of life whose allcontrouling might  Thro' wide creation beams divinely bright  Nor only does thy power in forming shine  But to annihilate dread king is thine  Shouldst thou withdraw thy stillsupporting hand  How languid nature would astonish'd stand  Thy frown night's antient empire would restore  And raise a blankwhere systems smil'd before  See in corruption allsurprizing state  How struggling life eludes the stroke of fate  Shock'd at the scene tho' sense averts its eye  Nor stops the wonderous process to descry  Yet juster thought the mystic change pursues  And with delight almighty wisdom views  The brute the vegetable world surveys  Sees life subsisting even from life's decays  Mark there selftaught the pensile reptile come  Spin his thin shroud and living build his tomb  With conscious care his former pleasures leave  And dress him for the business of the grave  Thence pass'd the shortliv'd change renew'd he springs  Admires the skies and tries his painted wings  With airy flight the insect roves abroad  And scorns the meaner earth he lately trod  Thee potent let deliver'd Israel praise  And to thy name their grateful homage raise  Thee potent God let Egypt's land declare  Which felt thy justice awfully severe  How did thy frown benight the shadow'd land  Nature revers'd how own thy high command  When jarring elements their use forgot  And the sun felt thy overcasting blot  When earth produc'd the pestilential brood  And the foul stream was crimson'd into blood  How deep the horrors of that awful night  How strong the terror and how wild the fright  When o'er the land thy sword vindictive past  And men and infants breath'd at once their last  How did thy arm thy favour'd tribes convey  Thy light conducting point th' amazing way  Obedient ocean to their march divide  The watery wall distinct on either side  While thro' the deep the long procession led  And saw the wonders of the oozy bed  Nor long they march'd till blackening in the rear  The vengeful tyrant and his host appear  Plunge down the deepthe waves thy nod obey  And whelm the threatening storm beneath the sea  Nor yet thy power thy chosen train forsook  When thro' Arabia's sands their way they took  By day thy cloud was present to the sight  Thy fiery pillar led the march by night  Thy hand amidst the waste their table spread  With feather'd viands and with heavenly bread  When the dry wilderness no streams supplied  Gush'd from the yielding rock the vital tide  What limits can omnipotence confine  What obstacles restrain thy arm divine  Since stones and waves their settled laws forego  Since seas can harden and since rocks can flow  On Sinai's top the muse with ardent wing  The triumphs of omnipotence would sing  When o'er its airy brow thy cloud display'd  Involv'd the nations in its awful shade  When gloomy darkness fill'd its midmost space  And the rock trembled to its rooted base  Yet there thy majesty divine appear'd  There shone thy glory and thy voice was heard  Even in the blaze of that tremendous day  Idolatry its impious rites could pay  Oh shame to thoughtThy sacred throne invade  And brave the bolt that linger'd round its head  VII WISDOM  O thou who when th' Almighty form'd this all  Upheld the scale and weigh'd each ballanc'd ball  And as his hand compleated each design  Number'd the work and fix'd the seal divine  O wisdom infinite creation's soul  Whose rays diffuse new lustre o'er the whole  What tongue shall make thy charms celestial known  What hand fair Goddess paint thee but thy own  What tho' in nature's universal store  Appear the wonders of almighty power  Power unattended terror would inspire  Aw'd must we gaze and comfortless admire  But when fair wisdom joins in the design  The beauty of the whole result's divine  Hence life acknowledges its glorious cause  And matter owns its great disposer's laws  Hence in a thousand different models wrought  Now fix'd to quiet now allied to thought  Hence flow the forms and properties of things  Hence rises harmony and order springs  Else had the mass a shapeless chaos lay  Nor ever felt the dawn of wisdom's day  See how associate round their central sun  Their faithful rings the circling planets run  Still equidistant never yet too near  Exactly tracing their appointed sphere  Mark how the moon our flying orb pursues  While from the sun her monthly light renews  Breathes her wide influence on the world below  And bids the tides alternate ebb and flow  View how in course the constant seasons rise  Deform the earth or beautify the skies  First spring advancing with her flowery train  Next summer's hand that spreads the sylvan scene  Then autumn with her yellow harvests crown'd  And trembling winter close the annual round  The vegetable tribes observant trace  From the tall cedar to the creeping grass  The chain of animated beings scale  From the small reptile to th' enormous whale  From the strong eagle stooping from the skies  To the low insect that escapes thy eyes  And see if see thou can'st in every frame  Eternal wisdom shine confess'd the same  As proper organs to the least assign'd  As proper means to propagate their kind  As just the structure and as wise the plan  As in this lord of alldebating man  Hence reasoning creature thy distinction find  Nor longer to the ways of heaven be blind  Wisdom in outward beauty strikes the mind  But outward beauty points a charm behind  What gives the earth the ambient air or seas  The plain the river or the wood to please  Oh say in whom does beauty's self reside  The beautifier or the beautified  There dwells the Godhead in the bright disguise  Beyond the ken of all created eyes  His works our love and our attention steal  His works surprizing thought the maker veil  Too weak our sight to pierce the radiant cloud  Where wisdom shines in all her charms avow'd  O gracious God omnipotent and wise  Unerring Lord and ruler of the skies  All condescending to my feeble heart  One beam of thy celestial light impart  I seek not sordid wealth or glittering power  O grant me wisdomand I ask no more  VIII PROVIDENCE  As from some level country's shelter'd ground  With towns replete with green inclosures bound  Where the eye kept within the verdant maze  But gets a transient vista as it strays  The pilgrim to some rising summit tends  Whence opens all the scene as he ascends  So providence the friendly point supplies  Where all the charms of Deity surprize  Here goodness power and wisdom all unite  And dazzling glories whelm the ravish'd sight  Almighty cause 'tis thy preserving care  That keeps thy works for ever fresh and fair  The sun from thy superior radiance bright  Eternal sheds his delegated light  Lends to his sister orb inferior day  And paints the silver moon's alternate ray  Thy hand the waste of eating time renews  Thou shed'st the tepid morning's balmy dews  When raging winds the blacken'd deep deform  Thy spirit rides commission'd in the storm  Bids at thy will the slackening tempest cease  While the calm'd ocean smooths its ruffled face  When lightnings thro' the air tremendous fly  Or the blue plague is loosen'd to destroy  Thy hand directs or turns aside the stroke  Thy word the fatal edict can revoke  When subterraneous fires the surface heave  And towns are buried in one common grave  Thou suffer'st not the mischief to prevail  Thy sovereign touch the recent wound can heal  To Zembla's rocks thou send'st the cheerful gleam  O'er Lybia's sands thou pour'st the cooling stream  Thy watchful providence o'er all intends  Thy works obey their great Creator's ends  And all the ills we feelor bliss we share  Are tokens of a heavenly Father's care  When man too long the paths of vice pursued  Thy hand prepar'd the universal flood  Gracious to Noah gave the timely sign  To save a remnant from the wrath divine  One shining waste the globe terrestrial lay  And the ark heav'd along the troubled sea  Thou bad'st the deep his antient bed explore  The clouds their watery deluge pour'd no more  The skies were clear'dthe mountaintops were seen  The dove pacific brought the olive green  On Ararat the happy patriarch tost  Found the recover'd world his hopes had lost  There his fond eyes review'd the pleasing scene  The earth all verdant and the air serene  Its precious freight the guardian ark display'd  While Noah grateful adoration paid  Beholding in the manytinctur'd bow  The promise of a safer world below  When wild ambition rear'd its impious head  And rising Babel heaven with pride survey'd  Thy word the mighty labour could confound  And leave the mass to moulder with the ground  From the mad toil while social order sprung  A peopled worlddistinct by many a tongue  From thee all human actions take their springs  The rise of empires and the fall of kings  See the vast theatre of time display'd  While o'er the scene succeeding heroes tread  With pomp the shining images succeed  What leaders triumph and what monarchs bleed  Perform the parts thy providence assign'd  Their pride their passions to thy ends inclin'd  A while they glitter in the face of day  Then at thy nod the phantoms pass away  No traces left of all the busy scene  But that remembrance saysThe things have been  While learning thro' the gloom benighted strays  And the dim objects vanish as we gaze  " But questions doubt whence sickly nature feels breast  " The aguefits her face so oft reveals  " Whence earthquakes heave the earth's astonish'd  " Whence tempests rage or yellow plagues infest  " Whence draws rank Afric her empoison'd stores  " Or liquid fires explosive Aetna pours"  Go sceptic mole demand th' eternal cause  The secret of his allpreserving laws  The depths of wisdom infinite explore  And ask thy Makerwhy thou knowst no more  Thy error's still in mortal things as great  As vain to cavil at the ways of fate  To ask why prosperous vice so oft succeeds  Why suffers innocence or virtue bleeds  Why monsters nature must with blushes own  By crimes grow powerful and disgrace a throne  Why saints and sages mark'd in every age  Perish the victims of tyrannic rage  Why Socrates for truth and freedom fell  While Nero reign'd the delegate of hell  In vain by reason is the maze pursu'd  Of ill triumphant and afflicted good  Fix'd to the hold so might the sailor aim  To judge the pilot and the steerage blame  As we direct to God what should belong  Or say that sovereign wisdom governs wrong  Nor always vice does uncorrected go  Nor virtue unrewarded pass below  Oft sacred justice lifts her awful head  And dooms the tyrant and th' usurper dead  Oft providence more friendly than severe  Arrests the hero in his wild career  Directs the fever poinard or the ball  By which an Amnon Charles or Caesar fall  Or when the cursed Borgias  Pope Alexander VI and his son Caesar Borgia See Mr Gordon's History  brew the cup  For meritbids the monsters drink it up  On violence oft retorts the cruel spear  Or fetters cunning in its crafty snare  Relieves the innocent exalts the just  And lays the proud oppressor in the dust  But fast as time's swift pinions can convey  Hastens the pomp of that tremendous day  When to the view of all created eyes  God's high tribunal shall majestic rise  When the loud trumpet shall assemble round  The dead reviving at the piercing sound  Where men and angels shall to audit come  And millions yet unborn receive their doom  Then shall fair providence to all display'd  Appear divinely bright without a shade  In light triumphant all her acts be shown  And blushing doubt eternal wisdom own  Mean while thou great intelligence supreme  Sovereign director of this mighty frame  Whose watchful hand and allobserving ken  Fashions the hearts and views the ways of men  Whether thy hand the plenteous table spread  Or measure sparingly the daily bread  Whether or wealth or honours gild the scene  Or wants deform and wasting anguish stain  On thee let truth and virtue firm rely  Bless'd in the care of thy approving eye  Know that thy providence their constant friend  Thro' life shall guard them and in death attend  With everlasting arms their cause embrace  And crown the paths of piety with peace  IX GOODNESS  Ye Seraphs who God's throne encircling still  With holy zeal your golden censers fill  Ye flaming ministers to distant lands  Who bear obsequious his divine commands  Ye Cherubs who compose the sacred choir  Attuning to your voice th' angelic lyre  Or ye fair natives of the heavenly plain  Who once were mortalnow a happy train  Who spend in peaceful love your joyful hours  In blissful meads and amaranthine bowers  Oh lend one spark of your celestial fire  Oh deign my glowing bosom to inspire  And aid the muse's unexperienc'd wing  While goodness theme divine she soars to sing  Tho' all thy attributes divinely fair  Thy full perfection glorious God declare  Yet if one beam's superior to the rest  Oh let thy goodness fairest be confess'd  As shines the moon amidst her starry train  As breathes the rose amongst the flowery scene  As the mild dove her silver plumes displays  So sheds thy mercy its distinguish'd rays  This led Creator mild thy gracious hand  When formless chaos heard thy high command  When pleas'd thine eye thy matchless works review'd  And goodness placid spoke that all was good  Nor only does in heaven thy goodness shine  Delighted nature feels its warmth divine  The vital sun's illuminating beam  The silver crescent and the starry gleam  As day and night alternate they command  Proclaim this truth to every distant land  See smiling nature with thy treasures fair  Confess thy bounty and parental care  Renew'd by thee the faithful seasons rise  And earth with plenty all her sons supplies  The generous lion and the brindled boar  As nightly thro' the forest walks they roar  From thee Almighty Maker seek their prey  Nor from thy hand unfed depart away  To thee for meat the callow ravens cry  Supported by thy allpreserving eye  From thee the feather'd natives of the plain  Or those who range the field or plough the main  Receive with constant course th' appointed food  And taste the cup of universal good  Thy hand thou open'st million'd myriads live  Thou frown'st they faintthou smilst and they revive  On virtue's acre as on rapine's stores  See heaven impartial deal the fruitful showers  " Life's common blessings all her children share"  Tread the same earth and breathe a general air  Without distinction boundless blessings fall  And goodness like the sun enlightens all  Oh man degenerate man offend no more  Go learn of brutes thy Maker to adore  Shall these thro' every tribe his bounty own  Of all his works ungrateful thou alone  Deaf when the tuneful voice of mercy cries  And blind when sovereign goodness charms the eyes  Mark even the wretch his awful name blasphemes  His pity spareshis clemency reclaims  Observe his patience with the guilty strive  And bid the criminal repent and live  Recal the fugitive with gracious eye  Beseech the obstinate he would not die  Amazing tendernessamazing most  The soul on whom such mercy should be lost  But would'st thou view the rays of goodness join  In one strong point of radiance all divine  Behold celestial muse yon eastern light  To Beth'lem's plain adoring bend thy sight  Hear the glad message to the shepherds given  " Goodwill on earth to man and peace in heaven"  Attend the swains pursue the starry road  And hail to earth the Saviour and the God  Redemption oh thou beauteous mystic plan  Thou salutary source of life to man  What tongue can speak thy comprehensive grace  What thought thy depths unfathomable trace  When lost in sin our ruin'd nature lay  When awful justice claim'd her righteous pay  See the mild Saviour bend his pitying eye  And stop the lightning just prepar'd to fly  O strange effect of unexampled love  View him descend the heavenly throne above  Patient the ills of mortal life endure  Calm tho' revil'd and innocent tho' poor  Uncertain his abode and coarse his food  His life one fair continued scene of good  For us sustain the wrath to man decreed  The victim of eternal justice bleed  Look to the cross the Lord of life is tied  They pierce his hands and wound his sacred side  See God expires our forfeit to attone  While nature trembles at his parting groan  Advance thou hopeless mortal steel'd in guilt  Behold and if thou can'st forbear to melt  Shall Jesus die thy freedom to regain  And wilt thou drag the voluntary chain  Wilt thou refuse thy kind assent to give  When breathless he looks down to bid thee live  Perverse wilt thou reject the proffer'd good  Bought with his life and streaming in his blood  Whose virtue can thy deepest crimes efface  Reheal thy nature and confirm thy peace  Can all the errors of thy life attone  And raise thee from a rebelto a son  O blest Redeemer from thy sacred throne  Where saints and angels sing thy triumphs won  When from the grave thou rais'd thy glorious head  Chain'd to thy car the powers infernal led  From that exalted height of bliss supreme  Look down on those who bear thy sacred name  Restore their ways inspire them by thy grace  Thy laws to follow and thy steps to trace  Thy bright example to thy doctrine join  And by their morals prove their faith divine  Nor only to thy church confine thy ray  O'er the glad world thy healing light display  Fair sun of righteousness in beauty rise  And clear the mists that cloud the heathen skies  To Judah's remnant now a scatter'd train  Thou great Messiah show thy promis'd reign  O'er earth as wide thy saving warmth diffuse  As spreads the ambient air or falling dews  And haste the time when vanquish'd by thy power  Death shall expire and sin defile no more  X RECTITUDE  Hence distant far ye sons of earth profane  The loose ambitious covetous or vain  Ye worms of power ye minion'd slaves of state  The giddy vulgar and the sordid great  But come ye purer souls from dross refin'd  The blameless heart and uncorrupted mind  Let your chaste hands the holy altars raise  Fresh incense bring and light the glowing blaze  Your grateful voices aid the muse to sing  The spotless justice of th' almighty king  As only rectitude divine he knows  As truth and sanctity his thought compose  So these the dictates which th' eternal mind  To reasonable beings has assign'd  These has his care on every mind impress'd  The conscious seals the hand of heaven attest  When man perverse for wrong forsakes the right  He still attentive keeps the fault in sight  Demands that strict atonement should be made  And claims the forfeit on th' offender's head  But Doubt demands"why man dispos'd this way  " Why left the dangerous choice to go astray  " If heaven that made him did the fault foresee  " Thence follows heaven is more to blame than he"  Nohad to good the heart alone inclin'd  What toil what prize had virtue been assign'd  From obstacles her noblest triumphs flow  Her spirits languish when she finds no foe  Man might perhaps have been so happy still  Happy without the privilege of will  And just because his hands were tied from ill  O wonderous scheme to mend th' almighty plan  By sinking all the dignity of man  Yet turn thine eyes vain sceptic own thy pride  And view thy happiness and choice allied  See virtue from herself her bliss derive  A bliss beyond the power of thrones to give  See vice of empire and of wealth possess'd  Pine at the heart and feel herself unbless'd  And say were yet no farther marks assign'd  Is man ungrateful or is heaven unkind  " Yes all the woes from heaven permissive fall  " The wretch adoptsthe wretch improves them all"  From his wild lust or his oppressive deed  Rapes battles murders sacrilege proceed  His wild ambition thins the peopled earth  Or from his avarice famine takes her birth  Had nature given the hero wings to fly  His pride would lead him to attempt the sky  To angels make the pigmy's folly known  And draw ev'n pity from th' eternal throne  Yet while on earth triumphant vice prevails  Celestial justice balances her scales  With eye unbiass'd all the scene surveys  With hand impartial every crime she weighs  Oft close pursuing at his trembling heels  The man of blood her awful presence feels  Oft from her arm amidst the blaze of state  The regal tyrant with success elate  Is forc'd to leap the precipice of fate  Or if the villain pass unpunish'd here  'Tis but to make the future stroke severe  For soon or late eternal justice pays  Mankind the just desert of all their ways  'Tis in that awful alldisclosing day  When high omniscience shall her books display  When justice shall present her strict account  While conscience shall attest the due amount  That all who feel condemn'd the dreadful rod  Shall own that righteous are the ways of God  Oh then while penitence can fate disarm  While lingering justice yet withholds its arm  While heavenly patience grants the precious time  Let the lost sinner recollect his crime  Immediate to the seat of mercy fly  Nor wait tomorrowlest tonight he die  But tremble all ye sons of blackest birth  Ye giants that deform the face of earth  Tremble ye sons of aggravated guilt  And ere too late let sorrow learn to melt  Remorseless Murder drop thy hand severe  And bathe thy bloody weapon with a tear  Go Lust impure converse with friendly light  And quit the mansions of defiling night  Drop dark Hypocrisy thy thin disguise  Nor think to cheat the notice of the skies  Unsocial Avarice thy grasp forego  And bid the useful treasure learn to flow  Restore Injustice the defrauded gain  Oppression bend to ease the captive's chain  Ere awful justice strike the fatal blow  And drive you to the realms of night below  But Doubt resumes " If justice has decreed  " The punishment proportion'd to the deed  " Eternal misery seems too severe  " Too dread a weight for wretched man to bear  " Too harshthat endless torments should repay  " The crimes of lifethe errors of a day"  In vain our reason would presumptuous pry  God's counsels are beyond conception high  In vain would thought his measur'd justice scan  His ways how different from the ways of man  Too deep for thee his secrets are to know  Enquire not but more wisely shun the woe  Warn'd by his threatenings to his laws attend  And learn to make omnipotence thy friend  Our weaker laws to gain the purpos'd ends  Oft pass the bounds the lawgiver intends  Oft partial power to serve its own design  Warps from the text exceeding reason's line  Strikes biass'd at the person not the deed  And sees the guiltless unprotected bleed  But God alone with unimpassion'd sight  Surveys the nice barrier of wrong and right  And while subservient as his will ordains  Obedient nature yields the present means  While neither force nor passions guide his views  Ev'n evil works the purpose he pursues  That bitter spring the source of human pain  Heal'd by his touch does mineral health contain  And dark affliction quits its fearsome shrowd  At his command and brightens into good  Thus human justicefar as man can go  For private safety strikes the dubious blow  But rectitude divine with nobler soul  Consults each individual in the whole  Directs the issues of the mortal strife  And sees creation struggle into life  And you ye happier souls who in his ways  Observant walk and sing his daily praise  Ye righteous few whole calm unruffled breasts  No fears can darken and no guilt infests  To whom his gracious promises extend  In whom they centre and in whom shall end  Which blest on that foundation sure who build  Shall with eternal justice be fulfill'd  Ye sons of life to whose glad hope is given  The bright reversion of approaching heaven  With grateful hearts his glorious praise recite  Whose love from darkness call'd you out to light  So let your piety reflective shine  As men may thence confess his truth divine  And when this mortal veil as soon it must  Shall drop returning to its native dust  The work of life with approbation done  Receive from God your bright immortal crown  IX GLORY  But oh adventerous muse restrain thy flight  Dare not the blaze of uncreated light  His praise proclaim ye monsters of the deep  Who in the vast abyss your revels keep  Before whose glorious throne with dread surprize  Th' adoring seraph veils his dazzled eyes  Whose pure effulgence radiant to excess  No colours can describe or words express  All the fair beauties all the lucid stores  Which o'er thy works thine hand resplendent pours  Feeble thy brighter glories to display  Pale as the moon before the solar ray  See on his throne the Hebrew monarch plac'd  In all the pomp of the luxuriant east  While mingling gems a borrow'd day unfold  And the rich purple waves emboss'd with gold  Yet mark this scene of painted grandeur yield  To the fair lilly that adorns the field  Obscur'd behold that fainter lilly lies  By the rich bird's  The Bird of Paradise seen in the Spice Islands  inimitable dies  Yet these survey confounded and undone  By the superior lustre of the sun  That sun himself withdraws his lessen'd beam  From thee the glorious author of his frame  Transcendent power sole arbiter of fate  How great thy glory and thy bliss how great  To view from thine exalted throne above  Eternal source of light and life and love  Unnumber'd creatures draw their smiling birth  To bless the heavens or beautify the earth  While systems roll obedient to thy view  And worlds rejoicewhich Newton never knew  Then raise the song the general anthem raise  And swell the concert of eternal praise  Assist ye orbs that form this boundless whole  Which in the womb of space unnumber'd roll  Ye planets who compose our lesser scheme  And bend concertive round the solar frame  Thou eye of nature whose extensive ray  With endless charms adorns the face of day  Consenting raise th' harmonious joyful sound  And bear his praises thro' the vast profound  His praise ye winds that fan the cheerful air  Swift as ye pass along your pinions bear  His praise let ocean thro' her realms display  Far as her circling billows can convey  His praise ye misty vapours wide diffuse  In rains descending or in milder dews  His praises whisper ye majestic trees  As your tops rustle to the vocal breeze  His praise around ye flowery tribes exhale  Far as your sweets embalm the spicy gale  His praise ye dimpled streams to earth reveal  As pleas'd ye murmur thro' the flowery vale  His praise ye feather'd choirs distinguish'd sing  As to your notes the tuneful forests ring  Or ye fair natives of our earthly scene  Who range the wilds or haunt the pasture green  Nor thou vain lord of earth with careless ear  The universal hymn of worship hear  But ardent in the sacred chorus join  Thy soul transported with the talk divine  While by his works th' almighty is confess'd  Supremely glorious and supremely bless'd  Great lord of life from whom this humble frame  Derives the power to sing thy holy name  Forgive the lowly muse whose artless lay  Has dar'd thy sacred attributes survey  Delighted oft thro' nature's beauteous field  Has she ador'd thy wisdom bright reveal'd  Oft have her wishes aim'd the secret song  But awful reverence still withheld her tongue  Yet as thy bounty lent the reasoning beam  As feels my conscious breast thy vital flame  So blest

REV MR MOORE OF CORNWALL  STruck with religious awe and solemn dread  I view these gloomy mansions of the dead  Around me tombs in mix'd disorder rise  And in mute language teach me to be wise  Time was these ashes liv'da time must be  When others thus shall standand look at me  Alarming thought no wonder 'tis we dread  O'er these uncomfortable vaults to tread  Where blended lie the aged and the young  The rich and poor an undistinguish'd throng  Death conquers all and time's subduing hand  Nor tombs nor marblestatues can withstand  Mark yonder ashes in confusion spread  Compare earth's living tenants with her dead  How striking the resemblance yet how just  Once life and soul informed this mass of dust  Around these bones now broken and decay'd  The streams of life in various channels play'd  Perhaps that skull so horrible to view  Was some fair maid's ye belles as fair as you  These hollow sockets two bright orbs contain'd  Where the loves sported and in triumph reign'd  Here glow'd the lips there white as Parian stone  The teeth dispos'd in beauteous order shone  This is life's goalno farther can we view  Beyond it all is wonderful and new  O deign some courteous ghost to let us know  What we must shortly be and you are now  Sometimes you warn us of approaching fate  Why hide the knowledge of your present state  With joy behold us tremblingly explore  Th' unknown gulph that you can fear no more  The grave has eloquenceits lectures teach  In silence louder than divines can preach  Hear what it saysye sons of folly hear  It speaks to youO give it then your ear  It bids you lay all vanity aside  O what a lecture this for human pride  The clock strikes twelvehow solemn is the sound  Hark how the strokes from hollow vaults rebound  They bid us hasten to be wise and show  How rapid in their course the minutes flow  See yonder yewhow high it lifts its head  Around the gloomy shade their branches spread  Old and decay'd it still retains a grace  And adds more solemn horror to the place  Whose tomb is this it says 'tis Myra's tomb  Pluck'd from the world in beauty's fairest bloom  Attend ye fair ye thoughtless and ye gay  For Myra dy'd upon her nuptial day  The grave cold bridegroom clasp'd her in its arms  And the worm rioted upon her charms  In yonder tomb the old Avaro lies  Once he was richthe world esteemed him wise  Schemes unaccomplish'd labour'd in his mind  And all his thoughts were to the world confin'd  Death came unlook'd forfrom his grasping hands  Down dropt his bags and mortgages of lands  Beneath that sculptur'd pompous marblestone  Lies youthful Florio aged twentyone  Cropt like a flower he wither'd in his bloom  Tho' flatt'ring life had promis'd years to come  Ye silken sons ye Florios of the age  Who tread in giddy maze life's flowery stage  Mark here the end of man in Florio see  What you and all the sons of earth shall be  There low in dust the vain Hortensio lies  Whose splendour once we view'd with envious eyes  Titles and arms his pompous marble grace  With a long history of his noble race  Still after death his vanity survives  And on his tomb all of Hortensio lives  Around me as I turn my wandering eyes  Unnumber'd graves in awful prospect rise  Whose stones say only when their owners dy'd  If young or aged and to whom ally'd  On others pompous epitaphs are spread  In memory of the virtues of the dead  Vain waste of praise since flattering or sincere  The judgmentday alone will make appear  How silent is this little spot of ground  How melancholy looks each object round  Here man dissolv'd in shatter'd ruin lies  So fast asleepas if no more to rise  'Tis strange to think how these dead bones can live  Leap into form and with new heat revive  Or how this trodden earth to life shall wake  Know its own place its former figure take  But whence these fears when the last trumpet sounds  Thro' heaven's expanse to earth's remotest bounds  The dead shall quit these tenements of clay  And view again the long extinguish'd day  It must be sothe same Almighty power  From dust who form'd us can from dust restore  Cheer'd with this pleasing hope I safely trust  Jehovah's power to raise me from the dust  On his unfailing promises rely  And all the horrors of the grave defy  THE SHEPHERD'S INVITATION A SONG  BY CHRISTOPHER MARLOE  COme live with me and be my love  And we will all the pleasures prove  That valleys groves or hill or field  Or wood or steepy mountain yield  There will we sit upon the rocks  And see the shepherds feed their flocks  By shallow rivers to whose falls  Melodious birds sing madrigals  There will I make thee beds of roses  With a thousand fragrant posies  A cap of flowers and a kirtle  Embroider'd all with leaves of myrtle  A gown made of the finest wool  Which from our pretty lambs we pull  Slippers lin'd choicely for the cold  With buckles of the purest gold  A belt of straw and ivy buds  With coral clasps and amber studs  And if these pleasures may thee move  Come live with me and be my love  Thy silver dishes for thy meat  As precious as the gods do eat  Shall on an ivory table be  Prepar'd each day for thee and me  The shepherdswains shall dance and sing  For thy delight each Maymorning  If these delights thy mind may move  Then live with me and be my love  THE NYMPH'S ANSWER  BY SIR WALTER RALEIGH  IF all the world and love were young  And truth in every shepherd's tongue  These pretty pleasures might me move  To live with thee and be thy love  But time drives flocks from field to fold  When rivers rage and rocks grow cold  And Philomel becometh dumb  The rest complain of cares to come  The flowers that bloom in wanton field  To wayward winter reckoning yield  A honeytongue a heart of gall  Is fancy's spring but sorrow's fall  Thy gowns thy shoes thy beds of roses  Thy cap thy kirtle and thy posies  Soon break soon wither soon forgotten  In folly ripe in reason rotten  Thy belt of straw and ivy buds  Thy coral clasps and amber studs  All these in me no mind can move  To come to thee and be thy love  What should we talk of dainties then  Of better meat than's fit for men  These are but vain that's only good  Which God hath blest and sent for food  But could youth last and love still breed  Had joy no date and age no need  Then these delights my mind might move  To live with thee and be thy love  A POEM  BY SIR W RALEIGH  SHall I like an hermit dwell  On a rock or in a cell  Calling home the smallest part  That is missing of my heart  To bestow it where I may  Meet a rival every day  If she undervalues me  What care I how fair she be  Were her tresses angel gold  If a stranger may be bold  Unrebuked unafraid  To convert them to a brayde  And with little more ado  Work them into bracelets too  If the mine be grown so free  What care I how rich it be  Were her hands as rich a prize  As her hairs or precious eyes  If she lay them out to take  Kisses for goodmanners sake  And let every lover skip  From her hand unto her lip  If she seem not chaste to me  What care I how chaste she be  No she must be perfect snow  In effect as well as show  Warming but as snowballs do  Not like fire by burning too  But when she by change hath got  To her heart a second lot  Then if others share with me  Farewell her whate'er she be  IN IMITATION OF MARLOE  COme live with me and be my dear  And we will revel all the year  In plains and groves on hills and dales  Where fragrant air breeds sweetest gales  There shall you have the beauteous pine  The cedar and the spreading vine  And all the woods to be a screen  Lest Phoebus kiss my summer's green  The seat of your disport shall be  Over some river in a tree  Where silver sands and pebbles sing  Eternal ditties to the spring  There shall you see the Nymphs at play  And how the Satyrs spend the day  The fishes gliding on the sands  Offering their bellies to your hands  The birds with heavenlytuned throats  Possess wood's echo with sweet notes  Which to your senses will impart  A music to enflame the heart  Upon the bare and leafless oak  The ringdove's wooings will provoke  A colder blood than you possess  To play with me and do no less  In bowers of laurel trimly dight  We will outwear the silent night  While Flora busy is to spread  Her richest treasure on our bed  Ten thousand glowworms shall attend  And all their sparkling lights shall spend  All to adorn and beautify  Your lodging with more majesty  Then in my arms will I enclose  Lillies fair mixture with the rose  Whose nice perfections in Love's play  Shall tune me to the highest key  Thus as we pass the welcome night  In sportful pleasure and delight  The nimble Fairies on the grounds  Shall dance and sing melodious sounds  If these may serve for to entice  Your presence to Love's Paradise  Then come with me and be my dear  And we will strait begin the year  AMARYLLIS OR THE THIRD IDYLLIUM OF THEOCRITUS  TRANSLATED BY FF  TO Amaryllis lovely nymph I speed  Meanwhile my goats along the mountain feed  O Tityrus tend them with assiduous care  Lead them to crystal springs and pastures fair  And of the ridgil's butting horns beware  Sweet Amaryllis have you then forgot  Our secret pleasures in the conscious grot  Where in my folding arms you lay reclin'd  Blest was the shepherd for the nymph was kind  I whom you call'd your Dear your Love so late  Say am I now the object of your hate  Say is my form displeasing to your sight  This cruel love will surely kill me quite  Lo ten large apples tempting to the view  Pluck'd from your favourite tree where late they grew  Accept this boon 'tis all my present store  Tomorrow will produce as many more  Meanwhile these heartconsuming pains remove  And give me gentle pity for my love  Oh was I made by some transforming power  A bee to buzz in your sequester'd bower  To pierce your ivy shade with murmuring sound  And the light leaves that compass you around  I know thee Love and to my sorrow find  A god thou art but of the savage kind  A lioness sure suckled the fell child  And with his brotherwhelps maintain'd him in the wild  On me his scorching flames incessant prey  Glow in my bones and melt my soul away  Ah nymph whose eyes destructive glances dart  Fair is your face but flinty is your heart  With kisses kind this rage of love appease  For me fond swain even empty kisses please  Your scorn distracts me and will make me tear  The flowery crown I wove for you to wear  Where roses mingle with the ivywreath  And fragrant herbs ambrosial odours breathe  Ah me what pangs I feel and yet the fair  Nor sees my sorrows nor will hear my prayer  I'll doff my garments since I needs must die  And from yon rock that points its summit high  Where patient Olpis snares the finny fry  I'll leap and tho' perchance I rise again  You'll laugh to see me plunging in the main  By a prophetic poppyleaf I found  Your chang'd affection for it gave no sound  Tho' in my hand struck hollow as it lay  But quickly wither'd like your love away  An old witch brought sad tidings to my ears  She who tells fortunes with the sieve and sheers  For leasing barley in my fields of late  She told me I should love and you should hate  For you my care a milkwhite goat supplied  Two wanton kids run frisking at her side  Which oft the nutbrown maid Erithacis  Has begg'd and paid beforehand with a kiss  And since you thus my ardent passion slight  Her's they shall be before tomorrow night  My right eye itches may it lucky prove  Perhaps I soon shall see the nymph I love  Beneath yon pine I'll sing distinct and clear  Perhaps the fair my tender notes may hear  Perhaps may pity my melodious moan  She is not metamorphos'd into stone  Hippomenes provok'd by noble strife  To win a mistress or to lose his life  Threw golden fruit in Atalanta's way  The bright temptation caus'd the nymph to stay  She look'd she languish'd all her soul took fire  She plung'd into the gulph of deep desire  To Pyle from Othrys sage Melampus came  He drove the lowing herd yet won the dame  Fair Pero blest his brother Bias' arms  And in a virtuous race diffus'd her charms  Adonis fed his cattle on the

his lasting rest  Iasion slumbering on the Cretan plain  Ceres once saw and blest the happy swain  With pleasures too divine for ears profane  My head grows giddy love affects me sore  Yet you regard not so I'll sing no more  Here will I put a period to my care  Adieu false nymph adieu ungrateful fair  Stretch'd near the grotto when I've breath'd my last  My corse will give the wolves a rich repast  As sweet to them as honey to your taste  THE HONEYSTEALER OR THE XIXTH IDYLLIUM OF THEOCRITUS  TRANSLATED BY FF  AS Cupid the slyest young wanton alive  Of its hoard of sweet honey was robbing a hive  The sentinel bee buzz'd with anger and grief  And darted his sting in the hand of the thief  He sobb'd blew his fingers stamp'd hard on the ground  And leaping in anguish show'd Venus the wound  Then began in a sorrowful tone to complain  That an insect so little should cause so great pain  Venus smiling her son in such taking to see  Said "Cupid you put me in mind of a bee  " You're just such a busy diminutive thing  " Yet you make woeful wounds with a desperate sting"  AGAINST LIFE  FROM THE GREEK OF POSIDIPPUS  WHat tranquil road unvex'd by strife  Can mortals chuse thro' human life  Attend the courts attend the bar  There discord reigns and endless jar  At home the weary wretches find  Severe disquietude of mind  To till the fields gives toil and pain  Eternal terrors sweep the main  If rich we fear to lose our store  Need and distress await the poor  Sad cares the bands of hymen give  Friendless forlorn th' unmarried live  Are children born we anxious groan  Childless our lack of heirs we moan  Wild giddy schemes our youth engage  Weakness and wants depress old age  Would fate then with my wish comply  I'd never live or quickly die  FF  FOR LIFE  FROM THE GREEK OF METRODORUS  MAnkind may rove unvex'd by strife  Thro' every road of human life  Fair wisdom regulates the bar  And peace concludes the wordy war  At home auspicious mortals find  Serene tranquillity of mind  Allbeauteous nature decks the plain  And merchants plough for gold the main  Respect arises from our store  Security from being poor  More joys the bands of hymen give  Th' unmarried with more freedom live  If parents our blest lot we own  Childless we have no cause to moan  Firm vigour crowns our youthful stage  And venerable hairs oldage  Since all is good then who would cry  " I'd never live or quickly die"  FF  A PARODY ON THE EPIGRAM OF PODISIPPUS  BY FRANCIS LORD VERULAM  THE world's a bubble and the life of man  Less than a span  In his conception wretched from the womb  So to the tomb  Curs'd from the cradle and brought up to years  With cares and fears  Who then to frail mortality shall trust  But limns the water or but writes in dust  Yet since with sorrow here we live opprest  What life is best  Courts are but only superficial schools  To dandle fools  The rural parts are turn'd into a den  Of savage men  And where's a city from all vice so free  But may be term'd the worst of all the three  Domestic cares afflict the husband's bed  Or pains his head  Those who live single take it for a curse  Or do things worse  Some would have children those that have them none  Or wish them gone  What is it then to have or have no wife  But single thraldom or a double strife  Our own affections still at home to please  Is a disease  To cross the sea to any foreign

PETRONIUS TRANSLATED  FAllen are thy locks for woeful winter hoar  Has stolen thy bloom and beauty is no more  Thy temples mourn their shady honours shorn  Parch'd like the fallow destitute of corn  Fallacious gods whose blessings thus betray  What first ye give us first ye take away  Thou late exulting in thy golden hair  As bright as Phoebus or as Cynthia fair  Now view'st alas thy forehead

And let the cock with impotent essay  Recite his usual prologue to the day  For Ceres now herself assistance lends  And to the mills the greenhair'd naiads sends  See on the summit buxomly they bound  And with their gambols work the axle round  True to th' impulsive waters winds the wheel  While four huge millstones crush the mouldering meal  Allbounteous Ceres as in  Alluding to the golden age when the earth was supposed to yield corn spontaneously In this epigram the naiads or waternymphs are beautifully said to be substituted by Ceres in the room of the women who formerly worked their mills with their hands and feet  days of yore  Your toil remits yet still affords her store  CS  LUCIAN'S GREEK EPIGRAM INSCRIBED ON A COLUMN ERECTED IN A PIECE OF LAND THAT HAD BEEN OFTEN BOUGHT AND

thro' yonder vale  His hair all matted and his cheeks all pale  Robin sad swain by love and sorrow pain'd  Of slighted vows and Susan thus complain'd  Hear me ye groves who saw me blest so late  Echo ye hills my sad reverse of fate  Ye winds that bear my sighs soft murmurs send  Come pay me back ye streams the drops I lend  And you sweet Susan source of all my smart  Bestow some pity on a broken heart  Happy the times by painful memory blest  When you possessing Robin all possess'd  Pass'd by your side each day brought new delight  And one sweet slumber shorten'd every night  My play your service for no toil seem'd hard  When your kind favour was the hop'd reward  I rose to milking tho' 'twas ne'er so cool  I call'd the cows up I kept off the bull  Home on my head I bore the pail upright  The pail was heavy but love made it light  And when you spilt the milk and 'gan to cry  I took the blame and simply said'twas I  When by the haycock's side you sleeping lay  Sent by good angels there I chanc'd to stray  Just as a loathsome adder rear'd his crest  To dart his poison in your lilly breast  Strait with a stone I crush'd the monster's head  You wak'd and fainted tho' you found him dead  Then from the pond I water brought apace  My hat brimful and dash'd it in your face  Still blue as bilberry your cold lips did quake  Till my warm kisses call'd the cherry back  When looking thro' his worship's garden gate  Ripe peaches tempted and you long'd to eat  Tho' the grim mastiff growl'd and sternly stalk'd  Tho' guns were loaded and old Madam walk'd  Nor dogs nor darkness guns or ghosts could fright  When Robin ventur'd for his Sue's delight  Joyful of midnight quick I post away  Leap the high wall and fearless pluck the prey  Down in your lap a plenteous shower they fall  Glad you receiv'd them and you eat them all  When fairday came I donn'd my sunday suit  Brush'd the best pillion clean and saddled Cutt  Then up we got you clung about my waist  Pleas'd to be hugg'd I charg'd you clip me fast  And when you loos'd your hold and backward slipp'd  I held your petticoats and never peep'd  The posied garters and the topknot fine  The golden gingerbread and all was mine  I paid the puppetshow the cakes the sack  And fraught with fairings brought you laughing back  Susan but spoke and each gay flower was there  To dress her boughpot or adorn her hair  For her the choicest of the woods I cull  Sloes hips and strawberries her belly full  My hoard of apples I to her confest  My heart was hers well might she have the rest  And Susan well approv'd her Robin's care  Yes you was pleas'd at least you said you were  In love's soft fire you seem'd like me to burn  And sooth'd my fondness with a kind return  At our long table when we sat to dine  You stretch'd your knees and mingled feet with mine  With fattest bacon you my trencher plied  And slic'd my pudding from the plumby side  And well I wot when our smallbeer was stale  You stole into the barn and brought me ale  But oh the soldier blaster of my hopes  Curse on pretending kings and papish popes  He came from Flanders with the redcoat crew  To fight with rebels and he conquer'd you  His doulas ruffles and his copper lace  His brickdust stockings and his brazen face  These are the charms for which you slight my youth  Charms much too potent for a maiden's truth  Soon on the feather'd fool you turn'd your eyes  Eager you listen'd to the braggard's lyes  And scorning me your heart to him resign  Your faithless heart by vows and service mine  True he is gone by our brave duke's command  To humble Britain's foes in foreign land  Ah what is that the spoiler bears away  The only thing for which 'twas worth to stay  But sorrow's dryI'll slake it in the brook  O welladay how frightful pale I look  Care's a consumer so the saying speaks  The saying's true I read it in my cheeks  Fie I'll be cheerful 'tis a fancied pain  A flame so constant cannot meet disdain  I'll wash my face and shake off foul despair  My love is kind alas I would she were  Well says our parson and our parson said  " True love and tithes should ever well be paid"  Susan from you my heart shall never roam  If your's be wandering quickly call it home  TO DAPHNE  Miss Mo  ON VALENTINE'S DAY  BY WILLIAM DUNCOMBE ESQUIRE  SEE Daphne see the sun with purer light  Now gilds the morn and chaces gloomy night  Advancing each return with brighter beams  He spreads his glories o'er the fields and streams  The snow dissolves before the western gale  And vernal flowers adorn the smiling vale  To life renew'd the budding trees awake  And from the stem the roseate blossoms break  The Cyprian queen o'er every grove and plain  O'er beasts and birds resumes her welcome reign  The birds are pair'd and warble thro' the grove  And beasts obey the genial call of love  Hence first the venerable rite begun  For ages past convey'd from sire to son  For every swain on this auspicious day  To chuse some maid the coming year to sway  To crop the violet and primrose fair  And deck with decent wreaths her glossy hair  For me content with what wise heaven ordains  This chequer'd scene alternate joys and pains  For me the spring of life shall bloom no more  Nor summer shine nor autumn swell her store  Winter alone with cheerless hand will shed  Henceforth the snow of age around my head  But tho' this claybuilt tenement decline  Still may th' immortal guest unclouded shine  And if Euterpe not disdain to smile  Your bard from Helicon with pleasing toil  Will with fresh flowers

SECRETARY PITT  SO stream the sorrows that embalm the brave  The tears that science sheds on glory's grave  So pure the vows which classic duty pays  To bless another Brunswic's rising rays  O Pitt if chosen strains have power to steal  Thy watchful breast awhile from Britain's weal  If votive verse from sacred Isis sent  May hope to charm thy manly mind intent  On patriot plans which antient freedom drew  Awhile with fond attention deign to view  This ample wreath which all th' assembled Nine  With skill united have conspir'd to twine  Yes guide and guardian of thy country's cause  Thy conscious heart shall hail with just applause  The duteous muse whose haste officious brings  Her blameless offering to the shrine of kings  Thy tongue well tutor'd in historic lore  Can speak her office and her use of yore  For such the tribute of ingenuous praise  Her harp dispens'd in Grecia's golden days  Such were the palms in isles of old renown  She cull'd to deck the guiltless monarch's crown  When virtuous Pindar told with Tuscan gore  How scepter'd Hiero stain'd Sicilia's shore  Or to mild Theron's raptur'd eye disclos'd  Bright vales where spirits of the brave repos'd  Yet still beneath the throne unbrib'd she sate  The decent handmaid not the slave of state  Pleas'd in the radiance of the regal name  To blend the lustre of her country's fame  For taught like ours she dar'd with prudent pride  Obedience from dependence to divide  Tho' princes claim'd her tributary lays  With truth severe she temper'd partial praise  Conscious she kept her native dignity  Bold as her flights and as her numbers free  And sure if e'er the muse indulg'd her strains  With just regard to grace heroic reigns  Where could her glance a theme of triumph own  So dear to fame as George's trophied throne  At whose firm base thy stedfast soul aspires  To wake a mighty nation's antient fires  Aspires to baffle faction's specious claim  Rouse England's rage and give her thunder aim  Once more the main her conquering banners sweep  Again her commerce darkens all the deep  Thy fix'd resolve renews each fair decree  That made that kept of yore thy country free  Call'd by thy voice nor deaf to war's alarms  Its willing youth the rural empire arms  Again the lords of Albion's cultur'd plains  March the firm leaders of their faithful swains  As erst stout archers from the farm or fold  Flam'd in the van of many a baron bold  Nor thine the pomp of indolent debate  The war of words the sophistries of state  Nor frigid caution checks thy free design  Nor stops thy stream of eloquence divine  For thine the privilege on few bestow'd  To feel to think to speak for public good  In vain corruption calls her venal tribes  One common cause one common end prescribes  Nor fear nor fraud or spares or screens the foe  But spirit prompts and valour strikes the blow  O Pitt while honour points thy liberal plan  And o'er the minister exalts the man  Isis cogenial greets thy faithful sway  Nor scorns to bid a statesman grace her lay  For science still is justly fond to blend  With thine her practice principles and end  'Tis not for her by false connections drawn  At splendid slavery's fordid shrine to fawn  Each native effort of the feeling breast  To friends to foes in servile fear supprest  'Tis not for her to purchase or pursue  The phantom favours of the cringing crew  More useful toils her studious hours engage  And fairer lessons fill her spotless page  Beneath ambition but above disgrace  With nobler arts she forms the rising race  With happier tasks and less refin'd pretence  In elder times she woo'd munificence  To rear her arched roofs in regal guise  And lift her temples nearer to the skies  Princes and prelates stretch'd the social hand  To form diffuse and fix her high command  From kings she claim'd yet scorn'd to seek the prize  From kings like George benignant just and wise  Lo this her genuine loreNor thou refuse  This humble present of no partial muse  From that calm bower which nurs'd thy thoughtful youth  In the pure precepts of Athenian truth  Where first the form of British liberty  Beam'd in full radiance on thy musing eye  That form whose mien sublime with equal awe  In the same shade unblemish'd Somers saw  Where once for well she lov'd the friendly grove  Which every classic grace had learn'd to rove  Her whispers wak'd sage Harrington to feign  The blessings of her visionary reign  That reign which now no more an empty theme  Adorns philosophy's ideal dream  But crowns at last beneath a George's smile  In full reality

his hand the bleeding spear  Now deigns a happier form to wear  And peaceful turns the soil  Th' insatiate furies of his train  Revenge and hate and fell disdain  With heart of steel and eyes of fire  Who stain the sword which honour draws  Who sully virtue's sacred cause  To Stygian depths retire  Unholy shapes and shadows drear  The pallid family of fear  And rapine still by shrieks pursued  And meagre famine's squalid brood  Close the dire crewYe eternal gates display  Your adamantine folds and shut them from the day  For lo in yonder pregnant skies  On billowy clouds the goddess lies  Whose presence breathes delight  Whose power th' obsequious seasons own  And winter loses half his frown  And half her shades the night  Softsmiling Peace whom Venus bore  When tutor'd by th' enchanting lore  Of Maia's blooming son  She sooth'd the synod of the gods  Drove discord from the blest abodes  And Jove resum'd his throne  Th' attendant graces gird her round  And sportive Ease with locks unbound  And every muse to leisure born  And Plenty with her twisted horn  While changeful Commerce spreads her loosen'd sails  Blow as ye list ye winds the reign of Peace prevails  And see to grace that milder reign  Sweet Innocence adorns the train  And deigns a human frame to wear  In form and features Albion's heir  A future GeorgePropitious powers  Ye delegates of heaven's high king  Who guide the years the days the hours  That float on time's progressive wing  Exert your influence bid us know  From parent worth what virtues flow  Be to less happy realms resign'd  The warrior's unrelenting rage  We ask not kings of herokind  The storms and earthquakes of their age  To us be nobler blessings given  O teach us delegates of heaven  What mightier bliss from union springs  Future subjects future kings  Shall bless the fair example shown  And from our character transcribe their own  A people zealous to obey  A monarch whose parental sway  Despises regal art  His shield the laws which guard the land  His sword each Briton's eager hand  His throne each Briton's heart  THE MAN OF SORROW  AH what avails the lengthening mead  By nature's kindest bounty spread  Along the vale of flowers  Ah what avails the darkening grove  Or Philomel's melodious love  That glads the midnight hours  For me alas the god of day  Ne'er glitters on the hawthorn spray  Nor night her comfort brings  I have no pleasure in the rose  For me no vernal beauty blows  Nor Philomela sings  See how the sturdy peasants stride  Adown yon hillock's verdant side  In cheerful ignorance blest  Alike to them the rose or thorn  Alike arises every morn  By gay contentment drest  Content fair daughter of the skies  Or gives spontaneous or denies  Her choice divinely free  She visits oft the hamletcot  When want and sorrow are the lot  Of avarice and me  But seeor i  it fancy's dream  Methought a bright celestial gleam  Shot sudden thro' the groves  Behold behold in loose array  Euphrosyne more bright than day  More mild than Paphian doves  Welcome oh welcome pleasure's queen  And see along the velvet green  The jocund train advance  With scatter'd flowers they fill the air  The woodnymph's dewbespangled hair  Plays in the sportive dance  Ah baneful grant of angry heaven  When to the feeling wretch is given  A soul alive to joy  Joys fly with every hour away  And leave th' unguarded heart a prey  To cares that peace destroy  And see with visionary haste  Too soon the gay delusion past  Reality remains  Despair has seiz'd my captive soul  And horror drives without controul  And slackens still the reins  Ten thousand beauties round me throng  What beauties say ye nymphs belong  To the distemper'd soul  I see the lawn of hideous dye  The towering elm nods misery  With groans the waters roll  Ye gilded roofs Palladian domes  Ye vivid tints of Persia's looms  Ye were for misery made  'Twas thus the man of sorrow spoke  His wayward step then pensive took  Along th' unhallow'd shade  THE MAN OF PLEASURE  YES to the sages be it told  However great or wise or old  Fair pleasure's my pursuit  For her I breathe the joyful day  For her thro' nature's wilds I stray  And cull the flowers and fruit  Sweep sweep the lute's enchanting string  And all thy sweets lov'd luxury bring  " To enjoy is to obey"  The heavenly mandate still prevail  And let each unwise wretch bewail  The dire neglected day  Ah graceless wretch to disobey  And devious quit the flowery way  And slight the gods decree  Still still ye gods the blessings send  If e'er my guilty hands offend  Indeed my heart is free  In pleasure's ray see nature shine  How dull alas at wisdom's shrine  " 'Tis folly to be wise"  Collusive term poor vain pretence  Enjoyment sure is real sense  In philosophic eyes  I love the carol of the hound  Enraptur'd on the living ground  In dashing ecstacy  I love the aukward courser's stride  The courser that has been welltried  And with him eager fly  And yes I love ye sneering wise  Fair honour spurning still at lies  As courting liberty  Still hand in hand great nature goes  With joys to honour never foes  And all those joys are free  And welcome thrice to British land  From Italy's voluptuous strand  Ye destin'd men of art  Breathe on the thrilling meaning sound  Each grace shall still be faithful found  At your admirer's heart  Avert ye gods that curse of fools  The pride of theoretic rules  That dupery of sense  I ne'er refuse the proffer'd joy  With every goodthat can annoy  Most easily dispense  I catch each rapture as it flies  Each happy loss a gain supplies  And boon still follows boon  The smile of beauty gilds my day  Regardless of her frowns I stray  Thus thro' my hours I run  But let me not for idle rhime  Neglect ungrateful good old time  Dear watch thou art obey'd  'Twas thus the man of pleasure spoke  His jovial step then careless took  To Celiaor her maid  THE BACCHANALIAN  YE sordid wretches chain'd to rules  As asses dull and obstinate as mules  Whose minds ne'er knew one liberal thought  Back to your sneaking miserable cells  Where narrowness of thinking dwells  With not one social sense of feeling fraught  There free from tumult free from strife  In silence doze nor snuff the wick of life  But slowly let it waste away  While cunning prudence plauds the saving scheme  Nor let its flame so much as seem  To cast a glimpse of one eccentric ray  Give me the man of blither soul  Whose spirits thro' an ampler channel roll  Who spite of method's drowsy plan  Will plunge alert into a sea of joy  And float on active fancy's buoy  And snatch at fleeting pleasure whilst he can  See yonder festive jocund band  A nectar'd goblet gracing every hand  Mirth opes the storehouse of the soul  And on illnature turns her polish'd key  Sullen the Demon limps away  Nor dares exert the function of controul  Thither let me bend in haste  And embrace the bottle's waist  Charms Anacreontic prove  Quaffing to the God of love  Brighter blushes paint his face  And he looks a fresher grace  When with Bacchus he reclines  Underneath his purple vines  How the jolly hunting song  Emblematic loud and strong  On attention's organ dwells  And the force of care dispells  'Till the fullvoic'd bursting chorus  Sets the fox and hounds before us  Sons of sorrow quit your beds  Seek the path which Bacchus treads  Drown your avaricious notions  In the claret's lively potions  Mind not what the miser says  Folly 'tis to earn his praise  Or his constitution fails  Or his avarice prevails  Else he'd laugh and drink and be  Airy tipsy gay as we  WW  THE ADVENTURER AND THE TREASURE  A FABLE  BY MR CHARLES DENIS  A Knight we read tho' authors clash  Once sallied forth adventures to explore  Not as knighterrants did in days of yore  With one squire only and no cash  Our hero so my author sings  Was taught to lay down this position  That men and money were the things  On which depends an expedition  He therefore took of both 'tis said  And as along he chas'd for prey  To succour dames and giants slay  These words upon a rock engrav'd he read  " Deep in the earth a treasure lies  " Hid from the light of day  " Whoe'er would gain the glorious prize  " Thro' me must hew his way"  Away to work they go  With pickaxe and with crow  What will not constancy atchieve  It softens damsels hearts more hard by far  Than marble flint or diamonds are  Tho' 'tis what some folks can't conceive  And now the rock is pierc'd quite thro'  But yet the treasure's not the nearer  Knighterrants pay for things much dearer  For lo a precipice appears in view  Where 'twas inscrib'd upon a post  " The money lies on th' other coast  " Which no adventurer can obtain  " 'Till this gulph's levell'd to a plain"  After much labour and much cost  The gulph is fill'd the plain is crost  'Twas time the adventures now were ended  For all the money was expended  But still new obstacles arise  A dragon guards the glorious prize  Which by the knight must be surmounted  Before the treasure could be counted  I'll try quoth he what I can do  My purse is emptythat's too true  But I have all my courage left  Of that no knight can be bereft  When honour calls I am the man'  He spoke and on the dragon ran  To paint each blow and streaminggash  From nose and mouth the streams that flash  Demands the pen that did indite  The actions of la Mancha's knight  We'll say then after many a slash  The dragon lay as 'twas but meet  A breathless carcase at his feet  Not that our hero came off clear  The victory cost him very dear  And many a wound left many a scar  The marks of honour and th' effects of war  At length the treasure's foundthey count it o'er  And what d'ye think was in the purse  Penny for penny less nor more  The very sum it had before  And well it was no worse  For when contending princes fight  For private pique or public right  Armies are rais'd the fleets are mann'd  They combat both by sea and land  When after many battles past  Both tir'd with blows make peace at last  What is it after all each nation gets  Whywidows taxes woodenlegs and debts  THE CONQUEROR AND THE OLD WOMAN  A FABLE  BY THE SAME  A Persian monarch one of those  Whose great ambition knew no bound  Some Cyrus or Darius we'll suppose  In whom no other vice was found  If we dare name ambition so  For some doubt whether it be vice or no  I have not time at present to confute  So grant the question rather than dispute  This Sophi far and wide his conquests spread  Full thirty crowns or more  Were pil'd on his anointed head  And yet with ease the weight he bore  For 'twas his great and chief delight  To break the yoke his vanquish'd subjects wore  And make their burden light  Attentive to the voice of the distress'd  Justice and virtue flourish'd in his reign  When from the confines of his vast domain  A good old woman who had been oppress'd  Came to the footstool of his throne  To have her grievances redress'd  And thus in piteous tragic tone  His majesty address'd  " Encourag'd by your fame I come from far  " Sir you're our king by right of war  " By right of subject I for justice sue  " I claim it and you'll grant it 'tis my due  " My daughter ravish'd and my house destroy'd  " And all by one whom you employ'd  " To act the king in place of you"  " I doubt not but all this is true  The conscious prince replied  " But so far off what can I do  " To make my people happy is my price  " And yet I cannot everywhere reside  " The sun which all the world surrounds  " Shines and enlivens but to certain bounds  " The rest are dark and cold"  " That's argued ill if I may be so bold  Return'd the matron to the sovereign  " 'Twas weak to grasp at what you cannot hold  " And conquer more than you can govern"  While o'er the sea of life we take our trip  Kings are by heaven commission'd to command  Captains not owners of the ship  'Tis theirs to steer the people safe to land  And when the bark with prudence they convey  We row with pleasure and with pride obey  PEACE A FABLE  BY THE SAME  AMongst the gods a contest rose  Which put Olympus in uproar  Just so it happen'd once before  When on the banks where Simois flows  As Homer sings in times of yore  From words their godships came to blows  When Jupiter aloud exclaim'd  " Where's Peace are ye not all asham'd  " Thus to expose yourselves again  " And be the laughingstock of men"  Then sternly look'd the heavens around  But Peace was nowhere to be found  " Haste Mercury thy wings prepare  " Fly down to earth and seek her there"  The god his father's summons quick obeys  Arrives and first the court surveys  " Politeness lives among the great  " And Peace no doubt has there a seat  " Such complaisance smiles in each face  " Peace needs must bask in every heart"  But here the god mistook the case  The mask remov'd 'twas fraud 'twas art  All ready to receive commands  Embracing feigning squeezing hands  As fair and yet as foul as sin  All peace without all war within  He next to Themis' bench his steps inclin'd  Not that he thought within the hall  Amidst the lawyer's brawl  The heavenborn fair to find  He turn'd his eyes to that tremendous seat  Where justice sits with awful air  In stern majestic state  But Peace in vain he look'd for there  Not even great Hardwick he whose guardian cares  Protect the orphan from the harpy's claws  Whose heart as well as hand the ballance bears  Can quell the clamorous jarring of the laws  For law like Janus has a double face  And either shows according to the case  For as you find it suits you better  You take the sense and leave the letter  Or vice versa with as good pretence  The letter take and leave the sense  The God was glad to get from hence  And to the temples now he goes  Where far from all the busy cares of life  The holy priests should taste repose  Free from ambition noise and strife  But lo instead of harmony divine  Beneath religion's sacred veil  'Twas interest guilt mistaken zeal  All side in parties and in sects combine  Some for their idol others for their shrine  And curse and damn and plunge in brother's blood  For what perhaps few understood  And now Jove's messenger directs his way  To those fam'd domes close by where Isis glides  Where Alma Mater bears the sway  And all the muses sport and play  And little do besides  Peace might with learning dwell tho' not with wit  But here again the god was bit  Pride faction jealousy and spite  Were centred there as in a fort  Not for each other to support  But what is strange to fight  Hence pamphleteers and daily writers  Some barefac'd liars some backbiters  And all the mercenary set  That write to live on what they get  Not that I say there's any shame  To write for bread as well as fame  But oh beware nor prostitute an art  Design'd to mend and not corrupt the heart  Now into private life the god descends  And first he views the marriage state  Alas where seldom Peace attends  For two that love there's ten that hate  Here husbands nominal there maiden wives  Who sue for a divorce  Of course  And some who plague each other all their lives  Relations more or less divided  According as by interest guided  Ungrateful children parents too severe  In short 'twas discord everywhere  " I've made quoth Mercury a fine look out  " To father Jove▪ what message shall I bring"  So said he turn'd about  And back to heaven prepar'd to wing  When as he cast his eyes around  Close by a hermit's cell he spied  The beauteous fugitive with olive crown'd  And Contemplation by her side  " Oh oh fair maid at last you're found"  " Yes Peace replied 'tis here I dwell  " Within this hermit's tranquil cell"  For gods as well as men must own  Who'd quiet live must live alone  Nor happy then unless he find  Within himself sweet Peace of mind  MERCURY AND THE SHADES  TO MISS M  BY THE SAME  CHarming Annetta but that I'm forbid  Fain would I grace these fables with your name  But in each praise I sure may echo fame  And then you're finely hid  Yet hold nor let the blushes rise  Nor anger sparkle in those eyes  Where Love has fixt his throne  But wherefore do I pardon ask  Remember you impos'd the task  This fable is your own  The messenger of Jove as 'twas his post  Led to the Stygian coast  Four shades departed from this life  A maiden fair just going to be married  A good man torn from children and from wife  A general that ne'er in fight miscarried  And to complete the motly crew  A poet who had bid the stage adieu  Alas the virgin shade then cry'd  Where is ah where my lover now  I'm sure with me he would have died  Had he but known the manner how  For when alive on love relying  He clasp'd me to his tender breast  And talk'd of nothing else but dying  Now I am gone where can he rest  If death flies not to his relief  'Tis plain one cannot die of grief  And next the married man  His piteous tale began  Ah me  Said he  What sighs are fetch'd what tears are shed  Since I am number'd with the dead  Oh did they but regret me less  My loving and beloved wife  My children dearer far than life  My only sorrow I confess  Is to reflect on their distress  What signifies your petty private smart  Then spoke the hero with a frown  The public feels my loss in every heart  And with their tears write my renown  Each in the general woe assumes a part  Whilst Roubillac employs his art  To raise himself and to transmit me down  With weak materials said the bard  You build your future fame  No doubt but bronze is very hard  And marble much the same  Yet marble moulders brass decays  There's nothing but the poet's lays  Can fix the hero's name  Had Homer never wrote  Achilles never had been known  And as our brother Voltaire says  Marlbro' will live in Addison  When Blenheim and the pillar's gone  I don't presume myself to quote  Tho' to be sure most folks must own  Amongst the best I was of note  The god could not forbear to smile  To hear their conscious prate  And so indulg'd them for a while  Each in his fond conceit  But being near th' infernal gate  He wav'd his wand aloft in air  And first bespoke the maiden fair  For you sweet shade that think your lover dying  Already in his arms another is complying  And thou poor soul uxorious ghost  What hast thou to regret or boast  Thy wife and heirs are gone to law  For in thy will was found a flaw  Intent on nothing but thy store  They count recount it o'er and o'er  And curse thee for not leaving more  And you my noble man of might  So fam'd for spoils so great in fight  Once gone you are of no import  Another has your place at court  Much greater far than all that went before  You was as one may say  Like him the hero of a day  Like you when snatch'd away  His feats and name will be no more  You master poet thank the doctor's pill  That sav'd you from the public scoff  You was a going fast down hill  'Twas high time to leave off  All think themselves of more importance far  Than really what they are  We every day experience what we dread  Forgot when absent as forgot when dead  None thought of us before that we had breath  And few will be remember'd after death  Except those few who live to fame  Death and oblivion are the same  THE CONNOISSEURS A FABLE  BY THE SAME TO MR HAYMAN  POets and painters flock together  In fancy's flight birds of a feather  Then tell me Hayman brother in Apollo  That god of whim whom you and I both follow  Is not our case who paint or write  In all respects the same  Arraign'd by ignorance and judg'd by spite  Dubious of praise but sure of blame  In every other science great or small  A jury's call'd of the same art and knowledge  The surgeon is examin'd at the hall  The doctor at the college  But those who use the pencil and the pen  Submit their works to all degrees of men  The scrivener's clerk the boy who sweeps the shop  The squeamish beau the mawkish fop  And thousands more beside  Of equal judgment sense and spirit  Condemn approve decide  And fix the standard of our merit  But if my friend will listen to the tale  He'll find their sentence not without appeal  A famous painter one of those  Whose pencil was to nature true  A Hogarth you'll suppose  But I suppose 'tis you  No matter whichone of the two  A portrait undertook to draw  Three sittings o'er  Perhaps some more  Genius as yet is not confin'd by law  'Tis done the picture is expos'd to view  Friends come to judge as usual in such case  What don't you know the face  Not I indeed do you  'Tis mine replied the man who sat  Impossible here's neither grace nor air  Why this is brown and you are fair  I never saw a piece so flat  Besides the mouth is all askew  And then such shades and then such light  Pray wipe it out begin anew  For as it stands 'tis quite a fright  Our artist pleads his cause in vain  He needs must paint it o'er again  And now they cry out ten times more  Why this is worse than that before  If you would have your portraits take  Give us resemblances that strike  That seem to think and want to speak  A Rubens Titian or Vandyke  But as for this there's not one feature like  The Virtuosi gone the painter said  I have a thought that's just come in my head  T' expose these learned friends of yours  Who under name of connoisseurs  Of strokes and touches stile and manner chatter  But be so kind to join with me  And you tomorrow morn shall see  How much they know about the matter  Next day the picture was set forth to sight  At proper distance and in proper light  Just as between them 'twas agreed  And now the learned meet to speak their mind  But still they can't the least resemblance find  'Twas not their friendnot him indeed  " That's very strange the portrait made reply  " Why gentlemen 'tis I myself 'tis I"  For in the cloth a hole was cut  Thro' which our man his real face had put  To give these connoisseurs the lie  Then are there none whose judgment fix the test  With taste and true discernment blest  Whose very praise rewards the artist's toil  O yes no doubt there are  Sometimes tho' very rare  You'll find a Chesterfield or meet a Boyle  LOVE ELEGY  Nec lacrymis crudelis amor nec gramina rivis  Nec cytiso saturantur apes nec fronde capellae  VIRG  THE dewy morn her saffron mantle spreads  High o'er the brow of yonder eastern hill  Each blooming shrub a roseate fragrance sheds  While the brisk skylark sings his carol shrill  Now where the willows to the rivulet bend  That winds its channel thro' the verdant mead  I'll o'er the turf my waining form extend  And rest on sedges dank my anxious head  Not all the sweets that scent the morning air  Not all the flowers that paint the vernal year  Can ease my bosom of its weighty care  Or teach my eyes to stop the falling tear  In vain the stream o'er pebbles glides along  And murmurs sweetlylulling as it flows  In vain the stockdove chants the gurgling song  Inviting slumbers soft and kind repose  The cruel pangs of fierce desire I prove  And think with transport on my absent fair  Ah mournful state to scorch in flames of love  Amidst the chilling frosts of sad despair  'Tis not my Delia's scorn my Delia's pride  That sinks my hopes in everlasting night  No charms to her the lavish gods denied  Who form'd her perfect as they form'd her bright  But ah the influence of some baneful star  Which frown'd malignant on my hapless birth  Has to my wishes plac'd an envious bar  Superior to the strongest power on earth  If crouding myriads arm'd for deadly war  Held from my longing eyes my bosom's queen  And kept her deep in gloomy caves afar  While mountains rose and oceans flow'd between  I might not force thro' spears and swords my way  I might not reach secure the distant shore  Yet urg'd by Venus I'd provoke the fray  Or perish bravely in the tumult's roar  When fell ambition drives us to the plain  Dismay'd by fear the doubting squadrons move  But I alike should certain pleasure gain  To fall or conquer for the maid I love  Curs'd be the wretch who first with impious hand  Taught fervile error o'er the world to roll  This chases freedom from each groaning land  This warps ah fad effect my Delia's soul  But say shall love which boundless as the wind  On youthful pinions every region tries  And mocks even virtue's dictates be confin'd  By superstition's evergalling ties  Ye fairy forms of gay delusion hence  Your flattering visions but increase my smart  I'll hear the sacred voice of manly sense  And quell my passion tho' I break my heart  How frail my vows my fix'd resolves how vain  No daring arm the power of love can brave  One thought of Delia wounds my peace again  Renews my woes and binds me more her slave  VERSES OCCASIONED BY THE DEATH OF MRS OLDFIEDD  WHen greatness claims or merit gives  A more distinguish'd tomb  St Peter's shrine the corse receives  Beneath its awful dome  There kings in stately marble sleep  And into dust return  While emblematic virtues weep  Around the lofty urn  Profusive of expence and art  Their labour might be sav'd  Useful for them if on their heart  These virtues were engrav'd  Lo there inscrib'd the warrior's praise  The fife and laurelwreath  While Death more justly crown'd with bays  Grins horribly beneath  There statesmen lie emblazon'd forth  With virtues not their own  And Walpole there perhaps thy worth  May posthumous be known  In vain secure of deathless praise  There poets ashes come  Since obsolete grows Chaucer's phrase  And moulders with his tomb  Lest too in death thy pleasant vein  And humour should be lost  O Rare Ben Johnson there is seen  Thy tragicomic bust  Let Dryden's statue there enshrin'd  Of purest marble stand  Whose wit to virtue if confin'd  Might one of gold demand  There Congreve too consign'd to fame  With envied lustre shine  Yet who the Fair's respect can blame  To muse as chaste as thine  In vain the monuments we raise  To future ages live  Nor fond respect nor venal praise  Can conscious virtue give  When God our scatter'd dust shall call  And rescue us from death  Will virtue then or stand or fall  On fame or vulgar breath  Tho' Oldfield even in death thy fate  Continue still the scene  Lest thou shouldst seem to mimic death  And act not be a queen  Pageants and borrow'd pomp display  Where Albion's monarchs lie  Thy fancied worth till the last day  Thy real merit try  For acting of another's part  Thy praise may now be known  But then more comfort 'twill impart  T' have acted well thy own  ON THE OLD BUST WITH A SOUR AIR ON MR DRYDEN'S MONUMENT IN WESTMINSTERABBEY  AT Dryden's tomb inscrib'd with Shd's name  That mite slow offer'd to establish'd fame  Fill'd with raw wonder Tyro stopt to gaze  And bless'd his bounteous Grace in kind amaze  The guardian genius from the sacred dust  Rekindling upwards wak'd the quickening bust  Glowing from every awful featurebroke  Disdainful lifeand thus the marble spoke  " Teach thy blind love of honesty to see  " 'Tis not my monumenttho' built on me  " Great peers 'tis known can in oblivion lie  " But no great poet has the power to die  " At cheap expence behold engrafted fame  " The tack'd associate of a buoyant name  " The pompous craft one lucky lord shall save  " And Shd borrow life from Dryden's grave"  'Twas saidand ere the short sensation died  The stiffening marble writh'd its form aside  Back from the titled waste of mouldering state  He turn'dneglectful of the court too late  And sadly conscious of mispointed praise  Frowns thro' the stone and shrinks beneath his bays  ON THE BIRTHDAY OF THE LATE STEPHEN POYNTZ ESQ  WRITTEN BY A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHEN AT SCHOOL  FRiend to my life and parent of my youth  Accept with kindness what I give with truth  Accept and know it undisguis'd by art  Th' o'erflowing fullness of a grateful heart  While joy returns with this returning morn  And thousands bless the day that Poyntz was born  Shall I alone no pious wishes send  Forget the patron and neglect the friend  Notho' my mind no costly present prove  Exalt my joy and dignify my love  Yet cheerful truth shall aid the muse to pay  The silent tribute of an humble lay  Yet gratitude that heavendirected fire  That muse shall raise that humble lay inspire  Glow in each thought inspirit every line  And while it warms my breast enliven thine  Say Poyntz when smiling on thy natal hour  Friend neighbour child their various blessings pour  When love unvex'd by troubles or by cares  Hails thy fair series of revolving years  Does not more real bliss thy thoughts employ  Does not thy swelling heart dilate with joy  Superior joy to know those years were spent  With ease and virtue affluence and content  Yes conscious honour with true greatness join'd  Smiles in thy face and glows within thy mind  In vain unmov'd by false deluding pride  The modest breast would its own merits hide  Still gloriously conceal'd true worth we see  Take double lustre from obscurity  O could I live like thee with equal fate  Politely good and innocently great  Each noble act each generous thought is thine  Those acts those thoughts to imitate be mine  Come thou my guide philosopher and friend  Conduct improve protect me and defend  Teach me like thee low fortune to despise  Like thee by virtue dignified to rise  Thro' life's calm voyage happily to steer  Gay not presuming grave yet not severe  Together let us view the classic page  The sophist's moral and the poet's rage  Pursue the calm advice th' inspiring flame  Compare and know their generous end the same  O did my humble artless breast but know  The piercing judgment or the active flow  Sublime the muse should mount with stronger wing  Thy peaceful worth thy glorious toils to sing  To thee in loftier strains the song should raise  And with the friend's unite the patriot's praise  Even now whilst grateful truths my breast inflame  I dare to celebrate the glorious theme  And bold the wilds of poetry explore  Thro' devious tracts and paths unknown before  CONTENTS  ODE to February Page  Stanzas occasioned by the forwardness of the spring  Spring Addressed to Myra  On the first of February  Horace ode IV
