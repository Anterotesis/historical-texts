wanted sense nor tongue  Tom Will and Jack like other boys  Lov'd tops and marbles sport and toys  The father scouted that false plan  That money only makes the man  But to the best of his discerning  Was bent on giving them good learning  He was a man of observation  No scholar yet had penetration  So with due care a school he sought  Where his young sons might well be taught  Quoth he "I know not which rehearses  "Most properly his themes or verses  "Yet I can do a father's part  "And school the temper mind and heart  "The natural bent of each I'll know  "And trifles best that bent may show"  'Twas just before the closing year  When Christmas holidays were near  The farmer call'd to see his boys  And ask'd how each his time employs  Quoth Will "there's father boys without  "He's brought us something good no doubt"  The father sees their merry faces  With joy beholds them and embraces  "Come boys of home you'll have your fill"  "Yes Christmas now is near" says Will  "'Tis just twelve daysthese notches see  "My notches with the days agree  "Well" said the sire "again I'll come  "And gladly fetch my brave boys home  "You two the dappled mare shall ride  "Jack mount the poney by his side  "Mean time my lads I've brought you here  "No small provision of good cheer"  Then from his pockets strait he takes  A vast profusion of plumcakes  He counts them out a plenteous store  No boy shall have or less or more  Twelve cakes he gives to each dear son  When each expected only one  And then with many a kind expression  He leaves them to their own discretion  Resolv'd to mark the use each made  Of what he to their hands convey'd  The twelve days past he comes once more  And brings the horses to the door  The boys with rapture see appear  The poney and the dappled mare  Each moment now an hour they count  And slash their whips and long to mount  As with the boys his ride he takes  He asks the history of the cakes  Says Will "dear father life is short  "So I resolved to make quick sport  "The cakes were all so nice and sweet  "I thought I'd have one jolly treat  "Why should I balk said I my taste  "I'll make at once a hearty feast  "So snugly by myself I fed  "When every boy was gone tobed  "I gorg' them all both paste and plum  "And did not waste a single crumb  "Indeed they made me to my sorrow  "As sick as death upon the morrow  "This made me mourn my rich repast  "And wish I had not fed so fast"  Quoth Jack "I was not such a dunce  "To eat my quantum up at once  "And tho' the boys all long'd to clutch 'em  "I would not let a creature touch 'em  "Nor tho' the whole were in my power  "Would I myself one cake devour  "Thanks to the use of keys and locks  "They're all now snug within my box  "The mischief is by hoarding long  "They're grown so mouldy and so strong  "I find they won't be fit to eat  "And I have lost my father's treat"  "Well Tom" the anxious parent cries  "How did you manage" Tom replies  "I shun'd each wide extreme to take  "To glut my maw or hoard my cake  "I thought each day its wants wou'd have  "And appetite again might crave  "Twelve schooldays still my notches counted  "To twelve my father's cakes amounted  "So every day I took out one  "But never ate my cake alone  "With every needy boy I shar'd  "And more than half I always spar'd  "One ev'ry day 'twixt self and friend  "Has brought my dozen to an end  "My last remaining cake today  "I wou'd not touch but gave away  "A boy was sick and scarce cou'd eat  "To him it prov'd a welcome treat  "Jack called me spendthrift not to save  "Will dubb'd me fool because I gave  "But when our last day came I smil'd  "For Will's were gone and Jack's were spoil'd  "Not hoarding much nor eating fast  "I serv'd a needy friend at last"  These tales the father's thoughts employ  "By these" said he "I know each boy  "Yet Jack who hoarded what he had  "The world will call a frugal lad  "And selfish gormandising Will  "Will meet with friends and favours still  "While moderate Tom so wise and cool  "The mad and vain will deem a fool  "But I his sober plan approve  "And Tom has gain'd his father's love  APPLICATION  So when our day of life is past  And all are fairly judg'd at last  The miser and the sensual find  How each misus'd the gifts assign'd  While he who wisely spends and gives  To the true ends of living lives  'Tis self denying moderation  Gains the GREAT FATHER'S approbation  Z  THE END
