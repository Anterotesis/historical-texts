their talents contributed to entertain inform or improve our minds no one has so happily or universally succeeded as he whom we may justly stile our first our greatest Poet Shakespeare For more than a century and a half this Author has been the delight of the Ingenious the text of the Moralist and the study of the Philosopher Even his cotemporary writers have ingenuously yielded their plaudit to his fame as not presuming it could lessen theirs set at so great a distance Such superior excellence could never be brought into a comparative light and jealousy is dumb when competition must be vain For him then they chearfully twined the laurelwreath and unrepining placed it on his brow where it will ever bloom while sense taste and natural feelings of the heart shall remain amongst the characteristics of this or any other nation that can be able to construe his language He is a Classic and cotemporary with all ages  True Nature's Drama represents all time  Though old the last the first retains its prime  But amidst all this burst of applause one single discordant voice is faintly heard Voltaire has stood forth his opponent One might imagine such a writer to have had taste enough to relish his  poetical beauties  at least tho' possibly some doubt might arise about his sympathy with his  moral ones  But he unfairly tries him by Pedant laws which our Author either did not know or regarded not His compositions are a distinct species of the Drama and not being an imitation of the Greek one cannot be justly said to have infringed its rules Shakespeare is a  model  not a  copy  he looked into nature not into books both for men and works 'Tis learned ignorance therefore to quote the antient exemplars against him Is there no spring inspired but Aganippe's font No raptured vision but on Parnassus' mount The Grecian Bards themselves had conceived a more liberal notion in this particular who by making  Phoebus  the God of Poetry seem to have acknowledged inspiration to be universal  But as it may shew more impartiality upon this subject to oppose one French authority to another I shall here quote against M Voltaire the Abbé Le Blanc's opinion of our Author in his  Letters on the English Nation  written to his Friend  He is says he of all Writers antient or modern the most of an original He is truly a great genius and Nature has endowed him with powers to shew it His imagination is rich and strong he paints whatever he sees and embellishes whatever he describes The Loves in the train of Venus are not represented with more grace in  the Pictures of Albanus than this Poet gives to those that attend on Cleopatra in his description of the pomp with which that Queen presents herself to Mark Antony on the banks of the Cydnus  The reputation of this Author is so great that I shall not be surprized if you suspect me of exaggeration in this account of him Those of our nation who have ever mentioned him have been content to praise  without being capable of judging sufficiently of his merits    To the further honour of our Author be it said that a Lady  Mrs Mo  tag    of distinguished merit has lately appeared a champion in his cause against this  minor critic  this  minute philosopher  this  fly upon a pillar of St Paul  's It was her example which has stirred up my emulation to this attempt for I own that I am ambitious of the honour of appearing to think at least though I despair of the success of writing like her  Mr Pope in the Preface to his edition of this Author says  Of all the English Poets Shakespeare must be confessed to be the fairest and fullest subject for Criticism and to afford the most numerous as well as most conspicuous instances both of beauties and blemishes of all sorts  And again  I cannot however but mention some of his principal and characteristic excellencies for which notwithstanding his defects he is justly and deservedly elevated above all other Dramatic Writers  He might have added the following observation from Longinus to his remarks who says that  In reading Homer Plato or any other of the great geniuses of antiquity whenever we happen to meet with passages which appear to be unintelligible or absurd we ought fairly to conclude that were they alive to explain themselves in those places we should to our confusion be convinced that the ignorance or error lay in our own conceptions alone  Horace too may be referred to upon this occasion who indulgently says that  The blaze of fine writing gilds o'er its blots  Such was the candor such the modesty and such the deference shewn by Antient Commentators to the works of literature or genius The brightness of the sun concealed its spots from them but secondhand critics to speak in the words of a modern Author  peer through a smoked glass to observe them    The learned and ingenious Doctor Johnson has given us a just and beautiful simile on this subject  The works of a correct and regular writer says he is a garden accurately formed and diligently planted varied with shades and scented by flowers The composition of Shakespeare is a forest in which oaks extend their branches and pines tower in the air interspersed sometimes with weeds and brambles and sometimes affording shelter to myrtles and roses filling the eye with awful pomp and gratifying the mind with endless diversity  This lastmentioned Editor is the only one who has considered Shakespeare's writings in a  moral light and therefore I confess myself of opinion that he has best understood them by thus pointing to their highest merit and noblest excellence And from several passages in the Doctor's Preface particularly where he says that  From his writings indeed a system of  social duties  may be selected for he who thinks reasonably must think  morally    as well as from frequent reflections of my own respecting the oeconomical conduct of life and manners which have always arisen in my mind on the perusal of Shakespeare's works I have ventured to assume the task of placing his Ethic merits in a more conspicuous point of view than they have ever hitherto been presented in to the Public  My difficulty will not be  what to find  but  what to chuse  amidst such a profusion of sweets and variety of colours nay sometimes how to separate the moral from the matter in this Author's writings which are often so contexted that to continue Doctor Johnson's allegory above quoted they may be compared to an intermixture of the physic with the kitchen garden where both food and medicine may be culled from the same spot  Shakespeare is not only my Poet but my Philosopher also His anatomy of the human heart is delineated from  nature  not from  metaphysics  referring immediately to our intuitive sense and not wandering with the schoolmen through the pathless wilds of theory We not only  see  but  feel  his dissections just and scientificThe late ingenious Lord Lyttelton speaking of Sakespeare says  No author had  ever so copious so bold so creative an imagination with so perfect a knowledge of the passions the humours and sentiments of mankind He painted all characters from heroes and kings down to innkeepers and peasants with equal truth and equal force If human nature were quite destroyed and no monument left of it except his Works other Beings might learn what man was from those writings  Dialogues of the Dead    And Ben Johnson had long before said of him  Nature herself was proud of his designs  And joyed to wear the dressings of his lines  Shakespeare seems to possess that happy and peculiar kind of superiority over all other Dramatic Authors that the ancient poets and historians confessedly bear above the modern ones with regard to the genuine characters manners and sentiments of the persons exhibited in their respective writings In the first we see the  men of Nature  in the latter but  the children of the Schools    The world at present is held more in trammels than it formerly wasFrom our modes of education policies and breeding our conduct and demeanor are become more sophisticate our minds less candid and our actions more disguised Our modern literary painters represent us such as we appear but the genuine unadulterate heart can be moved by no affection allied by no sympathy with such factitious personages such puppets of polity such automata of modern refinement Hence love friendship patriotism are long since become  the obsolete sentiments of chivalry and romance But in all the representations of Shakespeare we are sensible of a connection his whole Dramatis Personae seem to be  our acquaintance and countrymen  while in most other exhibitions they appear to be  strangers and foreigners  Doctor Johnson upon comparing the Tragedy of Cato with one of our Author's plays says justly that  Addison speaks the language of  Poets  but Shakespeare that of  Men    Doctor Warburton says  Of all the literary exercitations of speculative men whether designed for the use or entertainment of the world there are none of so much importance or what are more of our immediate concern than those which let us into a knowledge of our nature Others may exercise the reason or amuse the imagination but these only can improve the heart and form the mind to wisdom Now in this science our Shakespeare is confessed to occupy the foremost place whether we consider the amazing sagacity with which he investigates every hidden spring and wheel of human action or his happy manner of communicating this knowledge in the just and lively paintings which he has given us of all our passions appetites and pursuits These afford a lesson which can never be too often repeated or too strongly inculcated  Shaftsbury though severe I think rather too much so against Shakespeare's faults allows that  By the justness of his moral the  aptness of his descriptions and the plain and natural turn of several of his characters he pleases his audience and gains their ear  without a single bribe from luxury or vice    Our Author's poetical beauties have been already selected though they needed it not as they are undoubtedly so striking as scarcely to require the being particularly pointed out to any Reader capable of conceiving or relishing them but a single line sometimes a word in many instances throughout his Works may convey a hint or impress a sentiment upon the heart if properly marked which might possibly be overlooked while curiosity is attending to the fable or the imagination transported with the splendor of diction or sublimity of images  There is a Moral sometimes couched in his Fable which whenever I have been able to discover I have pointed out to the Reader and from those pieces where this excellence is deficient in the Argument as particularly in his Historical Plays where poetical justice cannot always obtain human life not being the whole of our existence I have given his moral and instruction in detail by quoting the passages as they happen to lie detached or referring to the scope and tenor of the dialogue  In these remarks and observations I have not restricted myself to morals purely ethic but have extended my observations and reflections to whatever has reference to the general oeconomy of life and manners respecting prudence polity decency and decorum or relative to the  tender affections and fond endearments of human nature more especially regarding those moral duties which are the truest source of mortal blissdomestic ties offices and obligations  This code of morality has an advantage over any other of the kind on account of its not being conducted systematically In all books that treat upon these subjects the precepts are disposed methodically under separate heads or chapters as Ambition Bravery Constancy Devotion and so on to the end of the alphabet which mode though useful on account of references or as a commonplace book cannot be near so entertaining and consequently so well able to answer the  utile dulci  as a work of this sort where the documents rise out of the action immediately before our eyes and are constantly varying with the quick shifting of scenes person and subjects where love sometimes follows war jealousy succeeds friendship parsimony liberality and so proceeding throughout the intire  quicquid agunt homines  of human life  ERRATA  Page line last

other Dramatis Personae I insert the names of those only whom I have brought upon the Scene in the course of these remarks either as speaking themselves or being spoken to by others  THE MORALITY OF SHAKESPEARE's DRAMA ILLUSTRATED  The TEMPEST  THIS Play and the Midsummer Night's Dream which in all the latter editions immediately follows it are considered by Dr Warburton  as the noblest effort of that sublime and amazing imagination peculiar to Shakespeare which soars above the bounds of Nature without forsaking Sense or more properly carries Nature along with it beyond her terrestrial limits  He has indeed in both these exhibitions created Beings out of all visible existence or as he has himself most beautifully expressed it  Given to airy Nothing  A local habitation and a name  Yet by the powers of his genius has he contrived to make these chimeras of his brain think act and speak in a manner which appears so suited to the anomalous personages his magic has conjured up that  we readily adopt them into the scale of Nature from a presumption that were they really to exist they would probably resemble the characters which his wand has endowed them with  These two plays are generally supposed to have been the first and second of his writing though I believe there are no dates remaining to confirm this opinion which can therefore be founded only on the idea that his youthful imagination must naturally be thought to have been more sportive and exuberant than his riper judgment might have permitted the indulgence of And here indeed  She wantons as in her prime  And plays at will her virgin fancies  though if I may be allowed the liberty of a criticism about this matter I should be rather inclined to suppose this Play to have been one of his latter performances as all the  unities  are so strictly preserved in it  But though both these pieces possess all the  lesser merits  of poesy they are not so much suited to the purpose of my present undertaking especially the second as several others of the same author for the most material events in both being principally conducted by  machinery  or supernatural agency produce rather astonishment than reflection so that unless we adopt Dr Johnson's remark in the first scene of the Tempest  it may be observed of Gonzalo that being the only good man that appears with the King he is the only one who preserves his chearfulness in the wreck or his hope on the island  there is not so much to be collected from them as I could wish to be placed to the score of Morality However all that can be extracted from either referrible to this head shall be diligently pointed out to the reader With this view I shall lay the Fable of this Play before my reader for the sake of the Moral which may be so fairly deduced from it  Prospero a duke of Milan having been expelled his dominion by the usurpation of his brother Anthonio confederated with Alonzo a king of Naples is committed to the mercy of the winds and waves in a rotten bark accompanied only by his daughter Miranda a child of three years old but has had the good fortune to escape and be landed on an uninhabited island where the first scene is laid and the intire action continued during the whole representation  About twelve years after this event Anthonio with Alonzo Ferdinand his son and other attendants being on a voyage together are driven out of their course by a storm and wrecked upon this island but escape alive on shore where the Prince meeting with Miranda falls in love with her and a reciprocal passion is conceived on her part also  Prospero having thus got his enemies within his power on their repentance generously forgives them their cruelty and injustice recovers his dukedom again and the marriage of the lovers confirms an alliance on both sides  From this short story I think the following  general Moral  will naturally result That the ways the justice and the goodness of Providence are so frequently manifested towards mankind even in this life that it should ever encourage an honest and a guiltless mind to form hopes in the most forlorn situations and ought also to warn the wicked never to rest assured in the false confidence of wealth or power against the natural abhorrence of vice both in God and man  Many of the unforeseen events of life which appear to us but accident or contingency may possibly be parts of the secret workings of Providence  All chance direction which we cannot see  and have oftener been remarked rather as chastisements of vice than as reliefs from misery We are  sensible in our own nature of a stronger impulse to resent the first than even to commiserate the latter How much higher then must this sentiment rise in the Author of that very nature In wretchedness there is no contagion 'tis but particular and temporary the effects of vice are general and eternal  Part of a speech in this play may be better quoted here than elsewhere as it refers so immediately to this subject  ARIEL  speaking to the Conspirators  But remember  For that's my business to you that you three  From Milan did supplant good Prospero  Exposed unto the sea which hath requit it  Him and his innocent child for which foul deed  The Powers  delaying not forgetting  have  Incensed the seas and shores yea all the creatures  Against your peace Thee of thy son Alonzo  They have bereft and do pronounce by me  Lingering perdition worse than any death  Can be at once shall step by step attend  You and your ways whose wrath to guard you from  Which here in this most desolate isle else falls  Upon your heads is nothing but  heart's sorrow    And a clear life ensuing  Act III Scene iv    Let us now proceed to the particular maxims and sentiments which occur from the several parts of the Dialogue  ACT I  SCENE II  Miranda speaking of the shipwreck thus expresses her sympathetic feelings for the wretched  O I have suffered  With those that I saw suffer A brave vessel  Who had no doubt some noble creatures in her  Dash'd all to pieces O  the cry did knock  Against my very heart  Poor souls they perish'd  Had I been any God of power I would  Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere  It should the  good ship  so have swallowed and  The freighted souls within her  There is something in the fond expression of  good ship  in the last line but one which strikes me with an idea of a peculiar tenderness in her compassion for the unhappy sufferers  Prospero confessing the mad folly of trusting his reins of administration into other hands says  The Government I cast upon my brother  And to my State grew stranger  And again speaking of the same person  Being once perfected how to grant suits  How to deny them whom to advance and whom  To trash for overtopping new created  The creatures that were mine I say or changed them  Or else new formed them having both the key  Of officer and office set all things in the state  To what tune pleased his ear  that now he was  The ivy which had hid my princely trunk  And sucked my verdure out on't  In continuation  And my trust  Like a good parent did beget of him  A falsehood in its contrary as great  As my trust was which had indeed no limit  A confidence  sans  bound He being thus lorded  Not only with what my revenue yielded  But what my power might else exact like one  Who having unto truth by telling oft  Made such a sinner of his memory  To credit his own lie he did believe  He was indeed the Duke from substitution  And executing the outward face of Royalty  With all prerogative Hence his ambition growing  To have no screen between the part he played  And him he played it for he needs will be  Absolute Milan  In this account of the Duke's weakness with the natural consequences attending it the Poet has afforded a proper lesson to princes never to render themselves cyphers in their government by too dangerous a confidence in their favourites but ever to consider those persons to whom they depute the several offices of State as  ministers  in the  literal  sense of the word only not in the  political  one  When Prospero describes the hazards and difficulties of his forlorn voyage Miranda tenderly exclaims  Alack what trouble  Was I then to you  To which he in a kind of extasy of fondness replies  O a cherubim  Thou wast that did preserve me Thou didst smile  Infused with a fortitude from Heaven  When I have decked the sea with drops full salt  Under my burden groaned which raised in me  An undergoing stomach to bear up  Against what should ensue  Here the Poet finely points to that virtue of true manhood which serves to strengthen our fortitude and double our activity when objects whom the ties of Nature or the sympathy of affections have endeared to us require our solace or assistance in distress or danger While our cares centersolely in ourselves we are but  one  but become  two  where the heart is shared  Prospero  Here in this island we arrived and here  Have  thy schoolmaster made thee more profit  Than other princes can that have more time  For vainer hours and tutors not so careful  Here the too general dissipations of life are hinted at and those parents censured who transfer the pious duty of their children's education to mercenary preceptors except in the meaner articles of it the arts exercises and sciences Too few attend to the higher and more interesting charge of forming the mind and directing the heart to their proper objects and fewer still in deputing it to others seem to regard the chief requisites of character or capacity in those they intrust with this office looking upon competent scholarship to be alone sufficient  But a liberal education as far as it extends in Colleges and Schools does not always give a liberal  mind and as example is allowed to exceed precept so do those sentiments and principles which we imbibe in youth from the living manners of our tutors  Grow with our growth and strengthen with our strength  Those only are capable of sinking into the heart and imbuing the mind while mere didactic maxims remain a load upon the memory alone The first only  inspire us how to act  the latter but  instruct us how to speak    Prospero  And by my prescience  I find my zenith doth depend upon  A most auspicious star whose influence  If now I court not but omit my fortunes  Will ever after droop  This passage furnishes a prudent and necessary reflection to the mind of the reader that man's success in life often depends upon some lucky and critical occasion which suffered to slip by may ne'er return again Shakespeare expresses himself more fully on this subject in another place  There is a tide in the affairs of men c  JUL CAES Act iv Scene  Some other poet too presents us with a poetical image to the same purpose where he says that  opportunity is  bald behind  Post occasio calva    SCENE III  Prospero  to  Ariel  Dost thou forget  From what a torment I did free thee  Doctor Johnson in a note upon this passage has given us the traditionary system of the Hebrews relative to the Fallen Angels which has afforded me a hint that tempts me to consider the tenor of this scene in a more interesting light by observing upon the impatience of Ariel a condemned spirit claiming under his servitude the  promised redemption  before he had fulfilled the commands of his master This allusion whether Shakespeare intended it or no is so obvious that there would not require the  alteration of a syllable to have it inserted among the  Mysteries  Antient Dramatic exhibitions so called usually performed by the priests in the th and th centuries upon public theatres in which the several dispensations of the Gospel were profanely represented  Men would be Christians upon their own terms only and are too apt to think that  faith and fear  without  love or works  are sufficient for the purpose  ACT II  SCENE I  Gonzalo comforting and cheering up the spirits of his companions in the wreck speaks with a becoming resignation and proper gratitude towards Providence  Beseech you Sir be merryyou have cause  So have we all of joy for our escape  Is much beyond our loss our hint of woe  Is common every day some sailor's wife  The master of some merchant and the merchant  Have just our theme of woe But for the miracle  I mean our preservation few in millions  Can speak like us  Then wisely good Sir weigh  Our sorrow with our comfort  An uncouth or severe manner of giving reproof or offering advice is very justly and with equal good sense and tenderness reflected upon by Gonzalo in the following passage  My lord Sebastian  The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness  And time to speak it in You rub the sore  When you should bring the plaister  SCENE II  Trinculo most humourously ridicules the passion of the English for strange sights in the following reflection on seeing Caliban lying asleep on the ground whom he takes for a dead seamonster just cast ashore by the working of the waves  Were I in England now as once I was and had but this fish painted not a holyday fool there but would give a piece of silver There would this monster  make a man  any strange beast there  makes a man  When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian  Not however that this foible can fairly be induced against us as a national reflection by any means for it is not peculiar to this or any other particular people but will be found to be the common disposition and idle curiosity of mankind in general There is another piece of sarcasm also thrown out in the same speech as unjust as the former  When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar  No nation on the globe is more distinguished for charity humanity and benevolence than the English are at present And this must have been always their characteristic for manners may refine but cannot create virtues Polishing may give taste but feelings come from nature  After Trinculo has recovered from his fright and finds Caliban to be but an harmless savage so very simple as to believe Stephano to be the Man in the Moon he says  By this good light this is a very shallow monster  I afraid of him  a very shallow monster The man i' th' Moon a most poor credulous monster  'Tis to be observed here that he was not charged with having been afraid nor did any one know of it but himself and it was this very consciousness that forced such a bravado from him This is Doctor Warburton's remark 'Tis a just one and may be rendered general by observing that upon all occasions too prompt a defence of ourselves is a sort of selfaccusation  ACT III  SCENE I  Ferdinand's first speech here prettily expresses that kind of chearfulness with which a person undertakes labour or executes the meanest or most irksome offices for their  secondself  for those they love  There be some sports are painful but their labour  Delight in them sets off some kinds of baseness  Are nobly undergone and most poor matters  Point to rich ends This my mean task would be  As heavy to me as 'tis odious but  The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead  And makes my labour pleasure  My sweet mistress  Weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness  Had ne'er like executer I forget  But those sweet thoughts do even refresh my labour  Most busyless when I do it  The above speech has something of the same turn and spirit in it with that of Prospero in the second Scene of the First Act already observed upon  SCENE IV  The horrors and upbraidings of a wounded conscience are finely painted in the latter part of this scene  Alonzo  O it is monstrous monstrous  Methought  the billows spoke  and told me of it  The winds did sing it  to me and the thunder  That deep and dreadful organpipe  pronounced  The name of Prosper  It did bass my trespass  Gonzalo  All three of them are desperate  their great guilt    Like poison given to work a great time after  Now 'gins to bite the spirits  ACT IV  SCENE I  A chaste conduct between betrothed lovers is strongly urged and sanctified by severe maledictions and very natural predictions in the following passages  Prospero  giving his daughter to  Ferdinand  Then as my gift and thine own acquisition  Worthily purchased take my daughter But  If thou dost break her virgin knot before  All sanctimonious ceremonies may  With full and holy rite be ministered  No sweet aspersions shall the heavens let fall  To make this contract grow but barren hate  Soureyed disdain and discord shall bestrew  The union of your bed with weeds so loathly  That you shall hate it both Therefore take heed  As Hymen's lamps shall light you  Ferdinand  's reply  As I hope  For quiet days fair issue and long life  With such love as 'tis now the murkiest den  The most opportune place and strongest suggestion  Our worser Genius can shall never melt  Mine honour into lust to take away  The edge of that day's celebration  When I shall think that Phoebus' steeds are foundered  Or night kept chained below  A little after old Prospero being better acquainted with the fallibilities of human nature than the young lovers were repeats the same caution to Ferdinand again  Look thou be true do not give dalliance  Too much the rein the strongest oaths are straw  To th' fire i' th' blood be more abstemious  Or else good night your vow  To which Ferdinand answers as before  I warrant you Sir  The white cold virginsnow upon my heart  Abates the ardour of my liver  SCENE IV  There is a beautiful but humiliating reflection on the inconsiderableness of life and grandeur made by Prospero in this scene which is worthy of being added to the  golden verses of Pythagoras  and ought to be placed in gilt characters as an inscription on all the palaces monuments or triumphal arches of the earth  Our revels now are endedThese our actors  As I foretold you were all Spirits and  Are melted into air into  thin air  Aether    And like the baseless fabric of this vision  The cloudcapt towers the gorgeous palaces  The solemn temples the great globe itself  Yea all which it inherit shall dissolve  And like this unsubstantial pageant faded  Leave not a rack  Rack  the most ratified part of a cloud detached from it and floating in an higher region  behind  We are such stuff  As dreams are made of and our little life  Is rounded with a sleep  ACT V  SCENE I  The feelings and sentiments of humanity with the nobleness of remission upon repentance are here finely and most affectingly touched  Ariel  to  Prospero  The king  His brother and yours abide all three distracted  And the remainder mourning over them  Brimfull of sorrow and dismay but chiefly  Him that you termed the good old lord Gonzalo  His tears run down his beard like winter drops  From eaves of reeds your charm so strongly works them  That if you now beheld them your affections  Would become tender  Prospero  Dost thou think so Spirit  Ariel  Mine would sir were I human  Prospero  And mine shall  Hast thou which art but air a touch a feeling  Of their afflictions  and shall not myself  One of their  ind that relish all as sharply  Passion'd as they be kin  lier moved than thou art  Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick  Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury  Do I take part The rarer action is  In virtue than in vengeance  They being penitent  The sole drift of my purpose doth extend  Not a frown further Go release them Ariel  My charms I'll break their senses I'll restore  And they shall be themselves  This last passage closes the moral scene of the piece most beautifully in rising by degrees to the summit of all Ethic and Christian virtue humanity and forgiveness I shall therefore also conclude my remarks upon this performance with an allusion to a passage in Horace where he draws a contrast between Maevius and Homer which is perfectly applicable to our author when compared with almost any other Dramatic writer who has ever attempted the marvellous  One with a flash begins and ends in smoke  The other out of smoke brings glorious light  And without raising expectation high  Surprizes us with dazzling miracles  Roscommon's Translation of the Art of Poetry  A MIDSUMMER NIGHT's DREAM  Dramatis Personae  MEN  THESEUS Duke of Athens  LYSANDER in love with Hermia  DEMETRIUS in

with Lysander  HELENA in love with Demetrius  A Midsummer Night's Dream  I Shall not trouble my readers with the Fable of this piece as I can see no general moral that can be deduced from the Argument nor as I hinted before  Preface to the Tempest paragraph th  is there much sentiment to be collected even from the Dialogue But whatever harvest can be gleaned from this unfruitful field I shall endeavour to pick up as becomes a faithful steward of the farm  ACT I  SCENE I  Theseus  to  Hermia  To you your father should be as a God  One that composed your beauties yea and one  To whom you are but as a form in wax  By him imprinted and within his power  To leave the figure or disfigure it  In this speech the pious notion of the Antients with regard to this relation while genuine Nature was their sole Preceptor is fully expressed Here the duty of children to their parents is indeed carried to the height and yet methinks not at all too far They are the objects of our earliest affections of our first deference of our primary obligations Even superstition in this case as far at least as implicit obedience extends exceeds not true devotion  The Decalogue was originally written on two tables five in each The first refers solely to Religion the second to Morality only To honour our parents therefore as falling within the former line of obligations is by this distinction made one  of our  pious  duties as through them we honour the Creator who ordained this relation between us This precept then should seem to have a double tie upon us as partaking both of  piety  and  morals  and therefore however the latter bond may chance to be cancelled the first ought never to be dispensed with  In fine there is something so fond and endearing in the idea and exercise of a child's obedience and deference towards a parent that how rotten must the root be or how blighted the branches if such a tree should fail of producing its natural fruit  Thus far by way of general reflection only for I must notwithstanding admit that the particular instance of the daughter's compliance exacted by the father in this piece of resigning an husband of her own choice  upon equal terms  and accepting another chosen arbitrarily for her  by caprice merely  was too severe a trial of obedience Egeus here like Abraham would sacrifice his child at the altar not only without the command of God but contrary to his express purpose proclaimed aloud by the voice of Nature and further confirmed from the deductions of virtuous affection free will and rational election  When I said that the duty of a child was  natural  I did not mean to invest the parent with an authority which  was not so  and I cannot blame Hermia therefore upon the severe laws of Athens being declared to her for the chaste and spirited resolution she frames to herself on that occasion  So will I grow so live so die my lord  Ere I will yield my virgin patent up  Unto his lordship  to whose unwished yoke  My soul consents not to give sovereignty  SCENE II  Lysander the suitor elect of Hermia here makes an observation upon the state of love which is too often verified in life That a sympathy of affections  with other fitness of circumstances are seldom found to meet together so as to compleat an happy union  Lysander  Ah me  for ought that ever I could read  Could ever hear by tale or history  The course of true love never did run smooth  But either it was different in blood  Or else misgrafted in respect of years  Or else it stood upon the choice of friends  Or if there were a sympathy in choice  War Death or Sickness did lay siege to it  Making it momentary as a sound  Swift as a shadow short as any dream  Brief as the lightning in the collied night  That in a spleen  Spleen  for a sudden or hasty fit  unfolds both heaven and earth  And ere a man hath power to say Behold  The jaws of darkness do devour it up  So quick bright things come to confusion  SCENE III  In this scene we are charmed with that mildness modesty and generous eulogium with which the fond and unhappy Helena accosts a rival beauty and woo'd by the man she loves  Hermia  God speed fair Helena whither away  Helena  Call you me fair that fair again unsay  Demetrius loves you fairO happy fair  Your eyes are loadstars  The  polar star  by which mariners are guided in their course  and your tongue's sweet air  More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear  When wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear  Sickness is catchingOh were favour so  Yours would I catch fair Hermia ere I go  My ear should catch your voice my eye your eye  My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody  Were the world mine Demetrius being 'bated  The rest I'd give to be to you translated  O teach me how you look and with what art  You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart  Hermia had used no arts no coquetry to allure her lover from her for as she expresses it just after in the same dialogue  His folly Helena is no fault of mine  She had indeed happened to have done her an  injury  but  no wrong  and therefore the forsaken maid shews her justice in plaining her own ill fortune only without expressing the least manner of resentment against her unoffending rival  Hermia in the same scene alludes to the magic power of love which concenters all our ideas in one making us prefer a cottage to a palace and a desert to a grove according to the situation or circumstances of the object of our affections After having declared the purpose of flying her country with her lover she adds  Before the time I did Lysander see  Seemed Athens like a Paradise to me  O then what graces in my love do dwell  That he hath turned a heaven into hell  And Helena afterwards carries on the same idea in the following lines  Things base and vile holding no quantity  Love can transpose to form and dignity  Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind  And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind  Nor hath love's mind of any judgment taste  Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste  And therefore is love said to be a child  Because in choice he is so oft beguiled  Theseus too in a passage of his speech in the first Scene of the Fifth Act of this Play accords with the above sentiment  While the lover all as frantic  Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt  And Shakespeare has hinted a moral on this latter subject with regard to irregular or illplaced affection as Dr Warburton has justly observed  by as fine a metamorphosis as any in Ovid  in the last line of the following speech in the second Scene  of Act the Second the whole of which I shall transcribe here in order to shew how justly and poetically he has pointed to the different effects of passion upon busy and contemplative minds as well as on idle and dissipated ones  Oberon  to  Puck  That very time I saw but thou could'st not  Flying between the cold moon and the earth  Cupid all armed a certain aim he took  At a fair vestal throned by the West  This is meant as a compliment to Queen Elizabeth    And loosed his loveshaft smartly from his bow  As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts  But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft  Quenched in the chaste beams of the wat'ry moon  And the imperial votress passed on  In maiden in ditation fancy free  Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell  It fell upon a little western flower  Before milkwhite now purple with Love's wound  And maidens call it  Love in idleness    ACT V SCENE I  The deceptions of an enthusiastic or overheated fancy with the vain terrors of a dejected mind are well described in part of the following speech in which our author classes  the lunatic the lover and the poet  together and might have taken in the  fanatic  too along with them under the description of those who as he says in the first part of the same speech  Have such seething brains  Such shaping fantasies that apprehend  More than cool reason ever comprehends  Theseus  Such tricks hath strong imagination  That if it would but apprehend some joy  It comprehends some bringer of that joy  Or in the night imagining some fear  How easy is a bush supposed a bear  Among the  brief of sports  as it is called to be exhibited before Theseus on his weddingday this is the title of one  The thrice three Muses mourning for the death  Of Learning late  deceased in beggary    Mr Warton imagines this passage to have alluded to a poem of Spenser's stiled  The Tears of the Muses on the Neglect and Contempt of Learning  in his time Though this was not properly a complaint of that age only it has been so much the grievance of all times that it has long since obtained into a proverb  As poor as a poet    The case of such  unfortunate  persons  Of those whom Phoebus in his ire  Hath  blasted  with poetic sire  Swift    is certainly very hard Persons who apply their minds to letters must unavoidably neglect their temporal concerns and those who employ their time in the reformation or entertainment of the world should be supported by itNot by merely accidental and precarious emoluments but upon some more permanent foundation like the Clergy who have had a provision made for them for the same reason as above and the name of  Clerk  tho' now appropriated to the latter was formerly the common appellation of both The honour of such an establishment would be considerable to a State and the expence but small  for the numbers are but few    Theseus expresses a just sentiment in a prince when Philostrate the Master of his Revels objects to his being present at a play which the affections of the lowest rank of the Athenian citizens had framed for the celebration of his nuptials  Philostrate  No my noble Lord  It is not for you I have heard it over  And it is nothing nothing in the world  Unless you can find sport in their intents  Extremely stretched and conned with cruel pain  To do you service  Theseus  I will hear that play  For never any thing can be amiss  When simpleness and duty tender it  Hippolita also makes the same objection but from a motive of humanity only  I love not to see wretchedness o'ercharged  And duty in his service perishing  Theseus  Why gentle sweet  you shall see no such thing  Hippolita  He says they can do nothing in this kind  Theseus  The kinder we to give them thanks for nothing  Our sport shall be to take what they mistake  And what poor duty cannot do  Noble respect takes not in might but merit  Where I have come great clerks have purposed  To greet me with premeditated welcomes  Where I have seen them shiver and look pale  Make periods in the midst of sentences  Throttle their practised accent in their fears  And in conclusion dumbly have broke off  Not paying me a welcome Trust me Sweet  Out of their silence yet I picked a welcome  And in the modesty of fearful duty  I read as much as from the rattling tongue  Of saucy and audacious eloquence  Love therefore and tonguetied simplicity  In least speaks most to my capacity  I must here conclude my observations on this Play with the above beautiful passage as there does not appear to me to be any thing else in the remainder of it worthy to supply a reflection relative to the purposed scope or design of this Work  POSTSCRIPT  This Play is perfectly picturesque and resembles some rich landscape where palaces and cottages huntsmen and husbandmen princes and peasants appear in the same scene together  THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA  Dramatis Personae  MEN  DUKE of MILAN Father to Silvia  VALENTINE the two Gentlemen  PROTHEUS the two Gentlemen  ANTHONIO Father to Protheus  PANTHION Servant to Anthonio  WOMEN  SILVIA the Duke of Milan's Daughter beloved of Valentine  JULIA a Lady of Verona beloved of Protheus  THE Two Gentlemen of Verona  THE Fable of this Play has no more moral in it than the former nor does it make us much amends either by the number or variety of its documents I would therefore have passed it by as some of the editors have done on the supposition of its not being one of Shakespeare's but that I thought any thing which had ever been imputed to that author had a right to claim a place in this Work unless the rejection of it were established upon better grounds than the diversity of opinions about its authenticity among the Commentators  And indeed were I to offer any doubt upon this point myself it should not be so much from the objections adduced by the editors as on account of the unnatural inconsistency of character in the person of Protheus who in the first Act and during above half the second appears to stand in the most amiable and virtuous lights both of morals and manhood as a fond lover and a faithful friend and yet suddenly belies his fair seemings by an infidelity toward the first object and a treachery with regard to the second 'Tis true indeed that in the latter end he expresses a sort of contrition for his crimes but yet this still seems to remain equivocal as it does not appear to have arisen from any remorse of conscience or abhorrence of his baseness but rather from a disappointment in his pursuit and an open detection of his villainy  There are but few instances of this kind that I remember to have met with throughout the drama of Shakespeare for however he may sport as he often does with the three  unities  of Aristotle  time  place  and  action  he seldom sins against a fourth which I am surprised the Critics have not added as being worth them allnamely that of  character  the tenor of which is generally preserved from first to last in all his works This consistency is required in the epic and why not insisted on in the dramatic poem I cannot conceive  I am venturing I own beyond my purpose but I am tempted here upon mentioning his breach of the unities to observe that the Commentators do our author great injustice to examine him by the cold rules of artful construction Shakespeare's writings resemble the antient music which consisted in  melody  alone without regard to  harmony  which is a science of much later invention and it has been remarked that the original airs of every country which charm a natural ear most have been those that give offence to  modern composers  by an utter neglect of the  counterpoint  The compositions of our Bard have the same beauty with the same defect He ought therefore never to be considered but under the description which Milton has given of him  Our sweetest Shakespeare Fancy's child  Warbling his native woodnotes wild  Would they restrain him within the precincts of art the height the depth of whose imagination and creative genius found even the extent of Nature too streightly bounded for it to move in  Exhausted worlds and then imagined new  Like an eastern monarch his word was law his will and pleasure edicts and decrees But there are certain  mechanists  in criticism who have no other way of judging but by applying the  rule  and  compass  like antient gardeners who trimmed their foresttrees into cones and cylinders and reduced winding brooks to square canals A man must be  born  a critic as well as a poet but at this rate he may be  bred  both  But to return from this digression to the subject which lies more properly before us at present  ACT I  SCENE I  The great necessity and benefit of Travel are properly recommended and marked by apt phrase in the first speech here which opening with the addition of a few other passages seems to promise more than I am sorry to say the rest of the piece is responsible for And it is this circumstance which has induced the critics to suspect this Play not to have been originally one of Shakespeare's but only revised and enriched with fragments by him as it may be deemed to be not  a jewel  but only  a lump of paste  set round  with sparks    Valentine  Cease to persuade my loving Protheus  Homekeeping youth  have ever  homely wits  Were't not affection chains thy tender days  To the sweet glances of thy honoured love  I rather would intreat thy company  To see the wonders of the world abroad  Than living  dully sluggaraized  at home  Wear out thy youth in  shapeless idleness  Forming neither manners nor character    The tenderness and solicitudes of friendship are well and fondly expressed in the reply  Protheus  Wilt thou be gone Sweet Valentine adieu  Think on thy Protheus when thou haply seest  Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel  Wish me partaker in thy happiness  When thou dost meet good hap and in thy danger  If ever danger do environ thee  Commend thy grievance to my holy prayer  For I will be thy bead'sman Valentine  If ever danger do environ thee  This line strikes me with a peculiar beauty Protheus desires to be considered as a sharer in his friend's weal or woe during absence the first he mentions without any reserve  Wish me partaker in thy happiness  When thou dost meet good hap  But when he comes to speak of the latter he appears to catch himself up as if alarmed even at the idea of his danger and seems to have begun his prayers for him already  But not to quit the first subject hinted above only to reassume it again I shall introduce a speech from the fourth Scene following though somewhat out of its place here where Panthion speaking to the father of Protheus tells him the opinion of another person about him and his son  Panthion  He wondered that your lordship  Would suffer him to spend his life at home  While other men of slender reputation  Put forth their sons to seek preferment out  Some to the wars to try their fortunes there  Some to discover islands far away  Some to the studious Universities  For any or for all these exercises  He said that Protheus your son was meet  And did request me to importune you  To let him spend his time no more at home  Which would be great impeachment to his age  In having known no travel in his youth  Anthonie  Nor need'st thou much importune me to that  Whereon this month I have been hammering  I have considered well his loss of time  And how he cannot be a perfect man  Not being tried and tutored in the world  Experience is by industry achieved  And perfected by the  swift  Would not  shew  be a fitter word in this pla  e  course of time  But to return to the first Scene again In this and many of the subsequent ones the several parts of which shall be quoted as they follow in order to prevent the interruption of the subject our Author has truly described the nature the effects the anxieties the weaknesses the extravagancies and the miseries of the passion of love most philosophically poetically and experimentally  Valentine persuading Protheus to quit his mistress and accompany him on his travels says  To be in love where scorn is bought with groans  Coy looks with heartsore sighs one fading moment's mirth  With twenty watchful weary tedious nights  If haply won perhaps an hapless gain  If lost why then a grievous labour won  However but a folly bought with wit  Or else a wit by folly vanquished  Love is your master for he masters you  And he that is so yoked by a fool  Methinks should not be chronicled for wise  Protheus  Yet writers say as in the sweetest bud  The eating canker dwells so eating love  Inhabits in the finest wits of all  Valentine  And writers say as the most forward bud  Is eaten by the canker ere it blows  Even so by love the young and tender wit  Is turned to folly blasting in the bud  Losing his verdure even in the prime  And all the fair effects of future hopes  Protheus  alone    He after honour hunts I after love  He leaves his friends to dignify them more  I leave myself my friends and all for love  Thou Julia thou hast metamorphosed me  Made me neglect my studies lose my time  War with good counsel set the world at nought  Make wit with musing weak heart sick with thought  Valentine after his falling in love to Protheus  I have done penance for contemning love  Those high imperious thoughts have punished me  With bitter fasts with penitential groans  With nightly tears and daily heartsore sighs  For in revenge of my contempt of love  Love hath chaced sleep from my enthralled eyes  And made them watchers of my own heart's sorrow  O gentle Protheus love's a mighty lord  And hath so humbled me as I confess  There is no woe to his correction  Nor to his service no such joy on earth  Now no discourse except it be of love  Now can I break my fast dine sup and sleep  Upon the very naked name of love  Call her divine  Scene vii  Julia  and  Lucetta  A true devoted Pilgrim is not weary  To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps  Much less shall she who hath love's wings to fly  Oh knowest thou not his looks are my soul's food  Pity the dearth that I have pined in  By longing for that food so long a time  Didst thou but know the inly touch of love  Thou would'st as soon go kindle fire with snow  As seek to quench the fire of love with words  Lucetta  I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire  But qualify the fire's extreme rage  Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason  Julia  The more thou damm'st it up the more it burns  The current that with gentle murmur glides  Thou knowest being stopped impatiently doth rage  But when his fair course is not hindered  He makes sweet music with the enamelled stones  Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge  He overtaketh in his pilgrimage  And so by many winding nooks he strays  With willing sport to the wide ocean  Scene x  There are two other passages in this Play which I have not included among the above number of quotations because though they relate to the same subject yet not falling within the description of the passion but the artful or sinister conduct of it only I have reserved to a place by themselves  The first is where Valentine replies to the Duke who asks his advice how to gain a coy mistress  Win her with  gifts  if she respect not  words    Dumb jewels often in their silent kind  More than quick words do move a woman's mind  Act iii Scene ii  The second is in the fifth Scene following the above where the most effectual but basest method for curing a woman's love that can be devised is there pointed out  Duke  to  Protheus  What might we do to make the girl forget  The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio  Protheus  The best way is to slander Valentine  With falsehood cowardice and poor descent  Three things that women highly hold in hate  Duke  Ay but she'll think that it is spoke in hate  Protheus  True  if his enemy deliver it  Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken  By one whom she esteemeth as his friend  ACT V  SCENE IV  In the first speech here Valentine makes a reflection which cannot be too often marked to us upon the powerful effect of use or habit over the mind  of man Second nature is more than a match even for the first In this philosophy lie the manifest and manifold advantages of a good education which alone forms the different manners allotted to the sexes rendering men brave and preserving women chaste Exchange but the point of honour between them and you fill the world with amazons and dastards  How use doth breed a habit in a man  This shadowy desart unfrequented woods  I better brook than flourishing peopled towns  Here can I sit alone unseen of any  And to the nightingale's complaining notes  Tune my distresses and record my woes  In the same Scene he expresses himself most affectingly upon discovering the faithlessness of his friend and displays a noble and a generous nature in his ready forgiveness on the other's as prompt penitence  Thou treacherous man  Thou hast beguiled my hopes  nought but mine eye  Could have persuaded me  Now I dare not say  I have one friend alivethou would'st disprove me  Who should be trusted when one's own right hand  Is perjured to the bosom  Protheus    I'm sorry I must never trust thee more  But count the world a stranger for thy sake  The private wound is deepest Oh time accurst  'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst  Protheus  My shame and guilt confound me  Forgive me Valentine if hearty sorrow  Be a sufficient ransom for offence  I tender it here I do as truly suffer  As e'er I did commit  Valentine  Then I am paid  And once again I do receive thee honest  Who by repentance is not satisfied  Is nor of heaven nor earth  SCENE V and lost  The Duke  Now  by the honour of my ancestry  I do applaud thy spirit Valentine  And think thee worthy of an Empress' love  Know then I here forget all former griefs  Cancel all grudge repeal thee home again  Plead a new state in thy unrivalled merit  To which I thus subscribeSir Valentine  Thou art a gentleman and well derived  Take thou thy Silvia for thou hast deserved her  In this passage Valentine is justly commended f  his proper and becoming manhood in vindicatin the right both of his love and honour at the hazar  of his comparatively meaner life He has therefore a right to the appellation and character here given o him in the following line  Thou art  a gentleman  and  well derived  But what strikes me more particularly in this speech is the gallant Duke's asseveration in that truly noble expression  Now  by the honour of my ancestry  It was this generous spirited idea that continued down the race of heroes among us  while they did exist  and were the profession of heraldry never to be considered in any other light than as a record of men's worth  not titles  it would then become both a political and a liberal science Honours as Selden says should be  native  only and not  dative  derived from  Merits  not from  Gifts    MEASURE FOR MEASURE  Dramatis Personae  MEN  DUKE of Vienna  ANGELO Lord Deputy in the Duke's absence  ESCALUS an ancient Lord joined with him  CLAUDIO a young Gentleman  LUCIO his Friend  WOMEN  ISABELLA Sister to Claudio  JULIET with child by Claudio  MEASURE for MEASURE  I CANNOT see what moral can be extracted from the fable of this Piece but as the author of it seems to have thought otherwise I shall present the reader with his idea on this subject in his own words where the Duke passes sentence on Angelo his deputy for his double villainy  Haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure  Like doth quit like and  measure still for measure    Act v Scene vii  But as there is not matter enough here for further expatiating upon I shall proceed to collect together the dispersed maxims sentiments or morals which may be gathered from the field at large and which I shall arrange under their several heads without regard to the order of the drama as this method may best serve to give them an  united force  and enable them to act more strongly on the minds of my readers  ACT I  SCENE II  That our talents our faculties or powers are not our own properly but that we are to consider ourselves as endowed with such advantages by Providence for the more enlarged benefit of mankind is finely set forth in the following speech  Duke  Angelo  There is a kind of character in thy  life  Doctor Johnson reads  look  and I think rightly    That to the observer doth thy history  Fully unfold  Thyself and thy belongings  Are not thine own so proper as to waste  Thyself upon thy virtues them on thee  Heaven doth with us as we with torches do  Not light them for themselves for if our virtues  Did not go forth of us 'twere all alike  As if we had them not  Paulùm sepultae distat inertiae  Cel  ta virtus  Hor    Spirits are not finely touched  But to fine issues nor Nature never lends  The smallest scruple of her excellence  But like a thrifty Goddess she determines  Herself the glory of a creditor  Both thanks and use  The dangers to be apprehended to society from those who affect too much popularity are very justly remarked upon in the same Scene which judgment may be fully supported by innumerable instances of Demagogues to be met with in history both ancient and modern  Duke  I love the people  But do not like to stage me to their eyes  Tho' it do well I do not relish well  Their loud applause and  Ave's  vehement  Nor do I think the man of safe discretion  That does affect it  SCENE VI  That a spirit of liberty where the reins of government are suffered to relax is too apt to exceed into a licentiousness which counteracts its own ends is well noted here  Lucio  on seeing his friend carrying to prison  Why how now Claudio Whence comes this restraint  Claudio  From too much liberty  my Lucio liberty  As surfeit is the father of much fast  So every scope by the immoderate use  Turns to restraint our natures do pursue  Like rats that raven down their proper bane  A thirsty evil and when we drink we die  Again in the next Scene  Duke  We have strict statutes and most biting laws  The needful bits and curbs for headstrong steeds  Which for these nineteen years we have let sleep  Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave  That goes not out to prey Now as fond fathers  Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch  Only to stick it in their childrens sight  For terror not to use in time the rod  Becomes more mocked than feared so our decrees  Dead to infliction to themselves are dead  And liberty plucks justice by the nose  The baby beats the nurse and quite athwart  Goes all decorum  And just after condemning his own neglect in suffering the people to take such scope he carries his censure against himself so far as even to say that he had encouraged them to do so  For we bid this be done  When evil deeds have their permissive pass  And not the punishment  The same reflection is carried on in the fifth Scene of the Second Act where some one says  Lord Angelo is severe  To which Escalus his colleague in administration replies  It is but needful  Mercy is not itself that oft looks so  Pardon is still the nurse of second woe  But to recur back again to the first Act which I quitted in pursuit of the above argument started there in the sixth Scene where Claudio desires his friend to employ his sister to solicit his pardon he very judiciously urges that peculiar kind of persuasiveness which naturally dwells in youth and innocence  Acquaint her with the danger of my State  Implore her in my voice that she make friends  To the strict Deputy bid herself assay him  I have great hope in That for in her youth  There is a  prone  Doctor Johnson reads  power  or  prompt  either of which epithets would certainly render this passage more intelligible I prefer the latter expression  and speechless dialect  Such as moves men  And again in the last Scene of this first Act Lucio says to Isabella  Go to lord Angelo  And let him learn to know when maidens foe  Men give like gods but when they weep and kneel  All their petitions are as truly theirs  As they themselves would owe them  In the same Scene the nature and danger of irresolution is well described  Lucio  Our doubts are traitors  And make us lose the good we oft might win  By fearing to attempt  ACT II  SCENE I  The political arguments for justice with the humane motives for mercy are finely contrasted here between the two Deputies of the State  Angelo  We must not make a scarecrow of the law  Setting it up to fear the birds of prey  And let it keep one shape 'till custom makes it  Their perch and not their terror  Escalus  Ay but yet  Let us be keen and rather cut a little  Than fall and bruise to death  Let but your Honour know  Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue  That in the working of your own affections  Had time cohered with place or place with wishing  Or that the resolute acting of your blood  Could have attained the effect of your own purpose  Whether you had not sometime in your life  Erred in this point which now you censure him  And pulled the law upon you  Angelo  'Tis one thing to be tempted Escalus  Another thing to fall I not deny  The jury passing on the prisoner's life  May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two  Guiltier than him they try What's open made to justice  That justice seizes on What know the laws  That thieves do pass on thieves 'Tis very pregnant  The jewel that we find we stoop and take it  Because we see it but what we do not see  We tread upon and never think of it  You may not so extenuate his offence  For I have had such faults but rather tell me  When I that censure him do so offend  Let mine own judgment pattern out my death  And nothing come in partial Sir he must die  Escalus  Well heaven forgive him and forgive us all  Some rise by sin and some by virtue fall  Some run thro' brakes of ice and answer none  And some condemned for a fault alone  SCENE VII  We find the same subjects continued here with additional spirit and beauty  Isabella  to  Angelo  I have a brother is condemned to die  I do beseech you let it be his fault  And not my brother  Angelo  Condemn the fault and not the actor of it  Why every fault's condemned ere it be done  Mine were the very cypher of a function  To find the faults whose fine stands in the record  And let go by the actor  Isabella  O just but severe law Must he needs die  Angelo  Maiden no remedy  Isabella  Yes I do think that you might pardon him  And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy  Angelo  I will not do it  Isabella  But can you if you would  Angelo  Look what I  will not  Ought not  I should think to be a more proper expression here  that I cannot do  Isabella  But might you do it and do the world no wrong  If so your heart were touched with that remorse  As mine is to him  Angelo  He's sentenced 'tis too late  Isabella  Too late Why no I that do speak a word  May call it back again Well believe this  No ceremony that to great ones 'longs  Not the king's crown nor the deputed sword  The marshal's truncheon nor the judge's robe  Become them with one half so good a grace  As mercy does If he had been as you  And you as he you would have slipt like him  But he like you would not have been so stern  Angelo  Pray you be gone  Isabella  I would to heaven I had your potency  And you were Isabel should it then be thus  NoI would tell what 'twere to be a judge  And what a prisoner  Angelo  Your brother is a forfeit of the law  And you but waste your words  Isabella  Alas alas  Why all the souls that  were  Doctor Warburton has changed  were  to  are  because he says the expression in the text is  false divinity  I tremble at venturing to differ from so learned a judge in matters of theology but are we not taught that the  redemption  had released the  forfeit  We were then brought within the pale at least of salvation which the orthodoxy says we were not before and a second  forfeit  I should therefore suppose to be the consequence of our own transgression not that of our first parents  were forfeit once  And be that might the 'vantage best have took  Found out the remedy  How would you be  If he which is the top of judgment should  But judge you as you are Oh think on that  And mercy then will breathe within your lips  Like man new made  Angelo  Be you content fair maid  It is the law not I condemns your brother  Were he my kinsman brother or my son  It should be thus with him He dies tomorrow  Isabella  Tomorrow Oh that's sudden Spare him spare him  He's not prepared for death Even for our kitchens  We kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven  With less respect than we do minister  To our gross selves Good good my lord bethink you  Who is it that hath died for this offence  There's many have committed it  Angelo  The law hath not been dead tho' it hath slept  Those many had not dared to do that evil  If the first man that did th' edict infringe  Had answered for his deed Now 'tis awake  Takes note of what is done and like a prophet  Looks in a glass that shews what future evils  Or new or by remissness new conceived  And so in progress to be hatched and born  Are now to have no successive degrees  But ere they live to end  Isabella  Yet shew some pity  Angelo  I shew it most of all when I shew justice  For then I pity those I do not know  Which a dismissed offence would after gall  And do him right that answering one soul wrong  Lives not to act an other Be satisfied  Your brother diestomorrow  Isabella  Oh 'tis excellent  To have a giant's strength but it is tyrannous  To use it like a giant  Could great men thunder  As Jove himself does Jove would ne'er be quiet  For every pelting petty officer  Would use his heaven for thunder  Nothing but thunderMerciful heaven  Thou rather with thy sharp and sulph'rous bolt  Splittest the unwedgeable and gnarled oak  Than the soft myrtleO but man proud man  Drest in a little brief authority  Most ignorant of what he's most assured  His glassy essence like an angry ape  Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven  As make the angels weep who with our spleens  Would all themselves laugh mortal  We cannot weigh our brother with yourself  Great men may jest with saints 'tis wit in them  But in the less foul profanation  That in the captain's but a choleric word  Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy  Angelo  Why do you put these sayings upon me  Isabella  Because authority tho' it err like others  Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself  That skins the vice o' th' top Go to your bosom  Knock there and ask your heart what it doth know  That's like my brother's fault if it confess  A natural guiltiness such as his is  Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue  Against my brother's life  Angelo    Aside    She speaks and 'tis such sense  That my sense breeds with it    To  Isabel  Fare you well  Isabella  Gentle my lord turn back  Angelo  I will bethink me Come again tomorrow  Isabella  Hark how I'll bribe yougood my lord turn back  Angelo  How Bribe me  Isabella  Ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you  Not with fond shekele of the tested gold  Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor  As fancy values them but with true prayers  That shall be up at heaven and enter there  Ere funrise prayers from preserved souls  From fasting maids whose minds are delicate  To nothing temporal  I have transcribed perhaps more of this dialogue than may be thought strictly relative to the arguments of it but I found it impossible to break off before and I believe the reader would be sorry to have had me interrupt it sooner  SCENE VIII  The powerful attractions of virtue and modesty are finely shewn in Angelo's conflict and reflections here Isabella having in the last Scene received some hope of pardon for her brother takes leave of the Deputy with this expression  Save  your honour  Angelo  solus    From thee  even from thy virtue  What's this what's this Is this her fault or mine  The tempter or the tempted who sins most  Not shenor doth she temptbut it is I  That lying by the violet in the sun  Do as the carrion does not as the flower  Corrupt with virtuous season Can it be  That modesty may more betray our sense  Than woman's lightness having waste ground enough  Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary  And pitch our evils there Oh fie fie fie  What dost thou or what art thou Angelo  Dost thou desire her foully for those things  That make her good Oh let her brother live  Thieves for their robbery have authority  When judges steal themselves What do I love her  That I desire to hear her speak again  And feast upon her eyes What is't I dream on  Oh cunning enemy that to catch a saint  With saints dost bait thy hook most dangerous  Is that temptation that doth goad us on  To sin in loving virtue Ne'er could the Strumpet  With all her double vigour art and nature  Once stir my temper but this virtuous Maid  Subdues me quite Ever 'till this very now  When men were fond I smiled and wondered how  SCENE IX  The Duke here under the character of a friar in confessing Juliet gives an admirable lesson on the nature of  contrition  distinguishing it very properly from  attrition  merely and at the same time expresses a just but severe sentence against a woman's failure in the point of chastity their education their manners and the moral consequences of their frailty throwing so many more bars in their way than the modes of the world have opposed to the other sex  Duke  to  Juliet  Repent you fair one of the sin you carry  Juliet  I do and bear the shame most patiently  Duke  I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience  And try your penitence if it be found  Or hollowly put on  Juliet  I'll gladly learn  Duke  Love you the man that wronged you  Juliet  Yes as I love the woman that wronged him  Duke  So then it seems your most offenceful act  Was mutually committed  Juliet  Mutually  Duke  Then was your sin of heavier kind than his  Juliet  I do confess it and repent it father  Duke  'Tis meet so daughterBut repent you not  As that the sin hath brought you to this shame  Which sorrow's always towards ourselves not heaven  Shewing we'd not se  k Heaven as we love it  But as we stand in fear  Juliet  I do repent me as it is an evil  Duke  There rest  SCENE X  The frailty of human nature is well described in the wanderings of the mind in prayer and the struggle between virtue and passion in the first speech here which concludes with observing how apt the pageantry or false seemings of power are to impose on the world even  the great vulgar  as well as the  small    Angelo  solus    When I would pray and think I think and pray  To several subjects Heaven hath my empty words  Whilst my intention hearing not my tongue  Anchors on Isabel Heaven's in my mouth  As if I did but only chew its name  And in my heart the strong and swelling evil  Of my conception The state whereon I studied  Is like a good thing being often read  Grown feared and tedious yea my gravity  Wherein let no man hear me I take pride  Could I with boot change for an idle plume  Which the air beats for vain Oh place oh form  How often dost thou with thy case thy habit  Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls  To thy false seeming Blood thou art but blood  Let's write  good angel  on the Devil's horn  'Tis yet  Doctor Johnson's reading instead of  'tis not    the Devil's crest  SCENE XI  There is a proper sentiment of Christian humility expressed by Isabella in this place  Let me be ignorant and in nothing good  But graciously to know I am no better  And just after there is a virtuous argument finely supported by her against the insidious pleadings of the Deputy who after refusing her a pardon for her brother thus proceeds  Angelo  Admit no other way to save his life  As I subscribe not that nor any other  But in the  loss  Doctor Johnson more properly reads  toss  for  canvas  of the question  of question that you his sister  Finding yourself desired of such a person  Whose credit with the judge or own great place  Could fetch your brother from the manacles  Of the allbinding law and that there were  No earthly mean to save him but that either  You must lay down the treasures of your body  To this supposed or else let him suffer  What would you do  Isabella  As much for my poor brother as myself  That is were I under the terms of death  The impression of keen whips I'd wear as rubies  And strip myself to death as to a bed  That longing I've been sick for ere I'd yield  My body up to shame  Angelo  Then must your brother die  Isabella  And 'twere the cheaper way  Better it were a brother died for once  Than that a sister by redeeming him  Should die for ever  Angelo  Were not you then as cruel as the sentence  That you have slandered so  Isabella  Ignominy in ransom and free pardon  Are of two houses lawful mercy sure  Is nothing kin to foul redemp  on  ACT III  SCENE I  The Duke remaining still under the disguise of a friar comes to the prison to prepare Claudio for death upon which subject he makes a number of moral and philosophic reflections but these last mostly of the Stoic kind by observing on the precariousness and insignificancy of human life the whole of which I shall give here at full length  Duke  to  Claudio  Be absolute for death or death or life  Shall thereby be the sweeter Reason thus with life  If I do lose thee I do lose a thing  That none but fools would keep a breath thou art  Servile to all the skiey influences  That do this habitation where thou keep'st  Hourly afflict merely thou art death's fool  For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun  And yet runn'st toward him still Thou art not noble  For all the accommodations that thou bearest  Are nursed by baseness thou'rt by no means valiant  For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork  Of a poor worm Thy best of rest is sleep  And that thou oft provok'st yet grosly fear'st  Thy death which is no more Thou'rt not thyself  For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains  That issue out of dust Happy thou art not  For what thou hast not That thou striv'st to get  And what thou hast forget'st Thou art not certain  For thy complexion shifts to strange  effects  Dr Johnson reads  affects  and with good reason    After the moon If thou'rt rich thou'rt poor  For like an ass whose back with ingots bows  Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey  And death unloadeth thee Friend hast thou none  For thy own bowels which do call thee Sire  The mere effusion of thy proper loins  Do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum  For ending thee no sooner Thou hast nor youth nor age  But as it were an afterdinner's sleep  Dreaming on both for all thy  blasted  The Doctor also reads  blasted  instead of  blessed    youth  Becomes as aged and doth beg the alms  Of palsied eld and when thou'rt old and rich  Thou hast nor heat affection limb or beauty  To make thy riches pleasant What's yet in this  That bears the name of life Yet in this life  Lye hid more than a thousand deaths yet death we fear  That makes these odds all even  And in the next scene Isabella after hinting to her brother at certain base conditions on which his sentence might be remitted endeavours to strengthen his resolution to prefer death before dishonour by somewhat of the same manner of reasoning as above but more conclusive and concise  Oh I do fear thee Claudio and I quake  Lest thou a feverish life should'st entertain  And six or seven winters more respect  Than a perpetual honour Darest thou die  The sense of death is most in apprehension  And the poor beetle that we tread upon  In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great  As when a giant dies  To this suspicion of his weakness he replies with the spirit becoming a man of honour and virtue  Claudio  Why give you me this shame  Think you I can a resolution fetch  From flowery tenderness If I must die  I will encounter darkness as a bride  And hug it in my arms  But after having paid this compliment to heroism Human Nature comes in for its share in turn and he then pleads for life even on the most abject terms  Claudio  Oh Isabel  Isabella  What says my brother  Claudio  Death's a fearful thing  Isabella  And shamed life a hateful  Claudio  Ay but to die and go we know not where  To lie in cold obstruction and to rot  This sensible warm motion to become  A kneaded clod and the  delinquent  Instead of  delighted    Johnson  spirit  To bathe in fiery floods or to reside  In thrilling regions of thickribbed ice  To be imprisoned in the viewless winds  And blown with restless violence round about  The pendant world or to be worse than worst  Of those that lawless and uncertain thoughts  Imagine howling 'tis too horrible  The weariest and most loathed worldly life  That age ach penury and imprisonment  Can lay on Nature is a paradise  To what we fear of death  What an ignoble sentiment is here expressed in the four last lines of this speech and yet the great Maecenas had the same and declared it very nearly in the same words What a disgrace to letters But history describes him to have been a person of foppish and effeminate manners and 'tis but rarely that the outward character belies the inward one  Isabella's indignation against her brother on this occasion though it has no relation to the subjects we are upon yet as it may have an effect in raising the same resentment against vice and meanness in the minds of my readers I think it worthy to be inserted here  Isabella  Oh you beast  Oh faithless coward Oh dishonest wretch  Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice  Is't not a kind of incest to take life  From thine own sister's shame What should I think  Heaven grant my mother played my father fair  For such a warped slip of wilderness  Ne'er issued from his bloodTake my defiance  Die perish might my only bending down  Reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed  Oh fie fie fie  Thy sin's not accidental but a trade  Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd  'Twere best that thou diest quickly  SCENE VI  In the last speech of this scene our Author gives us a shocking but too just description of Slander  Duke  No might nor greatness in Mortality  Can censure 'scapebackwounding Calumny  The whitest virtue strikes What king so strong  Can tie the gall up in the slandering tongue  ACT IV  SCENE III  In the last passage of this Scene the Duke repeats the same reflection in still stronger terms  O place and greatness Millions of false eyes  Are stuck upon thee Volumes of report  Run with these false and most contrarious quests  Upon thy doingsthousand 'scapes of wit  Make thee the father of their idle dreams  And rack thee in their fancies  Such has been the complaint of all ages even when the scandal was merely  oral  but how much more intolerable has the offence become of late years when obloquy is not only privately spoken but publicly printed and openly circulated throughout these kingdoms The  Freedom  of the Press should be ever  held sacred among us 'Tis our  Palladium  But surely to restrain its  Licentiousness  can no more hurt the  Liberty  of it than the chastisement of felony can be said to injure the liberty of the subject  SCENE X  When Isabella upon a supposition of her brother's death curses Angelo for his perfidy the Duke reproves her in the following words  This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot  Forbear it therefore  give your cause to Heaven  Shakespeare seems to have wound up the several morals of his characters and dialogue in this place with an excellent Christian document against the rage of malediction and the passion of revenge for we find little more in the remainder of it sufficiently worthy of continuing any further remarks on the Piece  POSTSCRIPT  In Number of the SPECTATOR there is a parallel story with this of Angelo related though not in every circumstance the same of Rhynsault Governor of Zealand under Charles the Bald Duke of Burgundy which may amuse the reader to recur to after reading this Play  THE MERCHANT OF VENICE  Dramatis Personae  MEN  MOROCHIUS a Moorish Prince  PRINCE of Arragon  ANTHONIO the Merchant of Venice  BASSANIO his Friend  SALANIO Friends to Anthonio and Bassanio  SOLARINO Friends to Anthonio and Bassanio  GRATIANO Friends to Anthonio and Bassanio  LORENZO in love with Jessica  SHYLOCK a Jew  LAUNCELOT Servant to the Jew  WOMEN  PORTIA an Heiress  NERISSA her Maid  JESSICA the Jew's Daughter  THE MERCHANT of VENICE  I Shall take no further notice of the want of a moral fable in the rest of these Plays but shall proceed to observe upon the characters and dialogue without interruption for the future  ACT I  SCENE I  The forebodings or presentiments of evil natural to the human mind are strongly pointed at here It were in vain to attempt the investigation of this matter from philosophy any more than that of prophetic dreams so that all we have to do is simply to acquiesce in the fact itself which repeated experience has sufficiently vouched in too many remarkable instances to be imputed to common casualty  Anthonio Solarino  and  Salanio  Anthonio  In sooth I know not why I am so sad  It wearies me you say it wearies you  But how I caught it found it or came by it  What stuff 'tis made of whereof it is born  I am to learn  Upon which his two friends attempt to account for this impression on his mind in a very natural manneras  Where a man's treasure is there will his heart be also  Salanio  Your mind is tossing on the ocean  There where your  Argofies  with portly sail  Like Signiors and rich Burghers on the flood  Or as it were the pageants of the sea  Do overpeer the petty traffickers  That curtsie to them do them reverence  As they fly by them with their woven wings  Solarino  Believe me Sir had I such venture forth  The better part of my affections would  Be with my hopes abroad I should be still  Plucking the grass  To throw up into the air  to know where sits the wind  Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads  And every object that might make me fear  Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt  Would make me sad  Salanio  My wind cooling my broth  Would blow me to an ague when I thought  What harm a wind too great might do at sea  I should not see the sandy hourglass run  But I should think of shallows and of flats  And see my wealthy  Andrew  docked in sand  Vailing her high top lower than her ribs  To kiss her burial Should I go to church  And see the holy edifice of stone  And not bethink me strait of dangerous rocks  Which touching but my gentle vessel's side  Would scatter all the spices on the stream  Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks  And in a word but even now worth this  And now worth nothing Shall I have the thought  To think on this and shall I lack the thought  That such a thing bechanced would make me sad  But tell not meI know Anthonio  Is sad to think upon his merchandize  But when he denies that any reflection upon the state of his fortune or that even the passion of love has wrought this grave effect upon his spirits they then remain quite at a loss to account farther for it referring it merely to the peculiarity of his character or particular complexion of mind which is described and contrasted with one of an opposite cast with admirable humour  Solarino  Not in love neither Then let's say you're sad  Because you are not merry and 'twere as easy  For you to laugh and leap and say you're merry  Because you are not sad Now by twoheaded Janus  Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time  Some that will evermore peep through their eyes  And laugh like parrots at a bag piper  And others of such vinegar aspect  That they'll not shew their teeth in way of smile  Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable  Gratiano then coming in and taking notice of the seriousness of Anthonio's aspect alike imputes it to the same cause his other friends had done  You look not well Signior Anthonio  You have too much respect upon the world  They lose it that do buy it with much care  Believe me you are marvellously changed  To which he replies  I hold the world but as the world Gratiano  A stage where every man must play his part  And mine a sad one  Upon this Gratiano enters into the same humorous description of the different characters of men as Solarino had done  Let me play the fool  With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come  And let my liver rather heat with wine  Than my heart cool with mortifying groans  Why should a man whose blood is warm within  Sit like his grandfire cut in alabaster  Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice  By being peevish I tell thee what Anthonio  I love thee and it is my love that speaks  There are a sort of men whose visages  Do cream and mantle like a standing pool  And do a wilful stillness entertain  With purpose to be drest in an opinion  Of wisdom gravity profound conceit  As who should say "I am Sir Oracle  "And when I ope my lips let no dog bark"  O my Anthonio I do know of those  That therefore only are reputed wise  For saying nothing who I'm very sure  If they should speak would almost damn those ears  Which hearing them would call their  brothers fools  Alluding to the Scripture text  He that calleth his brother a fool  c    But fish not with this melancholy bait  For this fool's gudgeon this opinion  Another very common character in life is also described in the same scene though I think not fairly applicable to the person who was capable of making the speech above cited  Bassanio  Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in all Venice His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you may seek all day ere you find them and when you have them they are not worth the search  In the following passage of the same Scene there is a warmth of affection and generous friendship fondly and beautifully expressed  Bassanio  and  Anthonio  Bassanio  To you Anthonio  I owe the most in money and in love  And from your love I have a warranty  To unburden all my plots and purposes  How to get clear of all the debts I owe  Anthonio  I pray you good Bassanio let me know it  And if it stand as you yourself still do  Within the eye of honour be assured  My purse my person my extremest means  Lye all unlocked to your occasions  You know me well and herein spend but time  To wind about my love with circumstance  And out of doubt you do me now more wrong  In making question of my uttermost  Than if you had made waste of all I have  Then do but say to me what I should do  That in your knowledge may by me be done  And I am prest unto itTherefore speak  Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea  Nor have I money nor commodity  To raise a present sum therefore go forth  Try what my credit can in Venice do  That shall be rack'd even to the uttermost  To furnish thee to  Belmont  to fair  Portia    Go presently inquire and so will I  Where money is and I no question make  To have it of my trust or for my sake  Again in the third Scene of Act the Third the same noble spirit is carried on  Portia  and  Bassanio  Portia  Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble  Bassanio  The dearest friend to me the kindest man  The best conditionedan unwearied spirit  In doing courtesies and one in whom  The antient Roman honour more appears  Than any that draws breath in Italy  Portia  What sum owes  e the Jew  Bassanio  For me three thousand ducats  Portia  What no more  Pay him six thousand and deface the bond  Double six thousand and then treble that  Before a friend of this description  Shall lose a hair thro' my Bassanio's fault  And from the Fifth Scene of the same Act another passage may be quoted which breathes the same strain  Portia  and  Lorenzo  Lorenzo  Madam altho' I speak it in your presence  You have a noble and a true conceit  Of godlike amity which appears most strongly  In bearing thus the absence of your lord  But if you knew on whom you shew this honour  How true a gentleman you send relief to  How dear a lover of my lord your husband  I know you would be prouder of this work  Than customary bounty could inforce you  Portia  I never did repent of doing good  And shall not now for in companions  That do converse and waste the time together  Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love  There needs must be a like proportion  Of lineaments of manners and of spirit  Which makes me think that this Anthonio  Being the bosom lover of my lord  Must needs be like my lord If it be so  How little is the cost I have bestowed  In purchasing the semblance of my soul  From out the state of hellish cruelty  This comes too near the praising of myself  Therefore no more of it  There is a becoming reserve and modesty in this last sentence which gives an additional beauty to the character of Portia But I must now return again to the First Act that I may recover the order of the reflections which are made in this Piece  SCENE II  Here the golden mean is well recommended by shewing the excess on either side to be equally bad  Portia  and  Nerissa  Portia  By my troth Nerissa my little body is weary of this great world  Nerissa  You would be sweet madam if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are And yet for aught I see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing therefore it is no mean happiness to be seated in the  mean  superfluity comes sooner by white hairs but competency lives longer"  From thence Portia takes occasion to hint at the inefficacy of good counsel towards governing or restraining our passions  Portia  Good sentences and well pronounced  Nerissa  They would be better if well followed  Portia  If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor men's cottages princes palaces He is a good divine that follows his own instructions I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow my own teaching The brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip o'er the mashes of good counsel the cripple  ACT II  SCENE I  The next passage that occurs is a reflection on the casualties of fortune which no merit no industry no prudence can controul  Morochius  to  Portia  Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets  To try my fortune By this scimitar  That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince  That won three fields from Sultan Solyman  I would outstare the sternest eyes that look  Outbrave the heart most daring to the earth  Pluck the young sucking cubs from the shebear  Yea mock the lion when he roars for prey  To win thee lady But alas the while  If Hercules and Lichas  Page to Hercules  play at dice  Which is the better man the greater throw  May turn by fortune from the weaker hand  So is Alcides beaten by his page  And so may I blind Fortune leading me  Miss that which one unworthier may attain  And die with grieving  SCENE II  In this Scene the soliloquy of Launcelot is a strong picture of the mind of man whenever it debates within itself upon the right or wrong of a question in which it is any way interested for in such cases our passions even without our connivance are apt to plead their own cause and we but sophisticate while we think we reason In all doubtful matters where the arguments seem to be equally suspended 'tis prudent ever to suspect that side of the balance to be the lightest which we find our affections the most inclined to  Launcelot  Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew my master The fiend is at my elbow and tempts me saying to me Gobbo Launcelot Gobbo good Launcelot or good Gobbo or good Launcelot Gobbo use your legs take the start run away My conscience says no take heed honest Launcelot take heed honest Gobbo or as aforesaid honest Launcelot Gobbo do not run scorn running with the heels Well the most courageous fiend bids me pack  via  says the fiend away says the fiend for the heavens rouse up a brave mind says the fiend and run Well my conscience hanging about the neck of my heart says very wisely to me my honest friend Launcelot being an honest man's son or rather an honest woman's son for indeed my father did something smack something grow to he had a kind of tasteWell my conscience says budge not budge says the fiend budge not says my conscience Conscience says I you counsel ill fiend says I you counsel ill To be ruled by my conscience I should stay with the Jew my master who God bless the mark is a kind of devil and to run away from the Jew I should be ruled by the fiend who saving your reverence is the devil himself Certainly the Jew is the very devil  incarnal  and in my conscience my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew The fiend gives the more friendly counsel I will run fiend my heels are at your commandment I will run  SCENE IX  The description here given of the parting of two friends would make a beautiful and affecting subject for the pencil  Salanio  And even there his eye being big with tears  Turning his face he put his hand behind him  And with affection wond'rous sensible  He wrung Bassanio's hand and so they parted  SCENE X  The false or mistaken supputations of happiness which men are too often apt to frame to themselves are well remarked upon in this place  Prince  of  Arragon  on viewing the Caskets with their mottos  Fortune now  To my heart's hope Gold silver and base lead  Who choseth m  must give and hazard all he hath  Leaden c  s  et    You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard  What says the golden chest Ha let me see  Who chuseth me shall gain what many men desire  What many men desireThat may be meant  Of the fool multitude that chuse by shew  Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach  Which pries not to the interior but like the martlet  Builds in the weather on the outward wall  Even in the force and road of casualty  I will not chuse what many men desire  Because I will not jump with common spirits  And rank me with the barb'rous multitude  And immediately after in the same speech he makes a just and noble reflection distinguishing merit from dignities or titles  to  from titles  of  honour  Well then to thee thou silver treasurehouse  Tell me once more what title thou dost bear  Who chuseth me shall get as much as he deserves  And well said too for who shall go about  To cozen Fortune and be honourable  Without the stamp of merit Let none presume  To wear an undeserved dignity  O that estates degrees and offices  Were not derived corruptly that clear honour  Were purchased by the merit of the wearer  How many then should cover that stand bare  How many be commanded that command  How much low peasantry would then be  pickt  Pickt  ▪ instead of  glea  ed    From the true seed of honour How much honour  Gleaned  Gleaned  instead of  pickt    Johnson  from the chaff and ruin of the times  To be new  vanned  Vanned  of  in  ed  instead of  varnished    Warburton  These three alterations certainly preserve the purity of the metaphor from the manifest corruption of the text    ACT III SCENE I  The great principle of universal charity which soars above the partial respects of nations or of sects is strongly though indirectly inculcated in the Jew's speech here which according to this very principle should be received without prejudice though proceeding from the mouth of an Alien and an Infidel  Shylock speaking of Anthonio  He hath disgraced me and hindered me of half a million laughed at my losses mocked at my gains scorned my nation thwarted my bargains cooled my friends heated mine enemies and what's his reason  I am a Jew  Hath not a Jew eyes Hath not a Jew hands organs dimensions senses affections passions Fed with the same food hurt by the same weapons subject to the same diseases healed by the same means warmed and cooled by the same summer and winter as a Christian is If you prick us do we not bleed If you tickle us do we not laugh If you poison us do we not die  As the remainder of the speech exceeds the moderation of Christian ethics I think proper to stop the Jew's mouth here  The same person says something again to the like purport in the first Scene of Act the Fourth that ought to awaken our minds to proper sentiments of humanity upon this subject  Shylock  You have among you many  a purchased slave    Which like your asses and your dogs and mules  You use in abject and in slavish part  Because you bought them  Shall I say to you  Let them be free marry them to your heirs  Why sweat they under burdens Let their beds  Be made as soft as yours and let their palates  Be seasoned with such viandsYou will answer  The slaves are ours  Montesquieu in his  Spirit of Laws  speaking with a just contempt and humorous severity against all the arguments brought in defence of this cruelty  says that the strongest reason which can be given for the practice of using Negroes like beasts of burden is  their having black skins and flat noses    In the second Scene of the Third Act the difficulty of determining the true rate of persons or things is largely commented upon and as opinion is too often more under the dominion of fancy than of reason perhaps the stanzas which precede the reflections may serve as a proper prelude to the speech The reader at least I dare say will be pleased at finding them inserted here  A Song while  Bassanio  debates with himself on his choice of the caskets  Tell me where is fancy bred  In the heart or in the head  How begot how nourished  REPLY  It is engendered in the eyes  With gazing fed and fancy dies  In the cradle where it lies  Let us all  ing fancy's knell  I'll begin itDing dong bell  CHORUS  Ding dong bell  After which Bassanio speaks  So may the outward shows be least themselves  As the beginning of this speech is abrupt we are to suppose the former par  of the argument to have passed silently in his mind before he speaks aloud  is  tor Johnson's remark    The world is still deceived with ornament  In law what plea so tainted and corrupt  But being seasoned with a gracious voice  Obscures the shew of evil In religion  What damned error but some sober brow  Will bless it and approve it with a text  Hiding the grossness with fair ornament  There is no vice so simple but assumes  Some mark of virtue on its outward part  How many cowards whose hearts are all as false  As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins  The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars  Who inward searched have livers white as milk  And these assume but valour's excrement  To render them redoubtedLook on beauty  And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight  Which therein works a miracle in nature  Making them lightest that wear most of it  So are those crispy snaky golden locks  Which make such wanton gambols with the wind  Upon supposed fairness often known  To be the dowry of a second head  The skull that bred them in the sepulchre  Thus ornament is but the gilded shore  To a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf  Veiling an Indian  dowdy  Dowdy  The word in the text is  beauty  but reformed by Sir Thomas Hanmer  in a word  The seeming truth which cunning times put on  To entrap the wisest Then thou gaudy gold  Hard food for Midas I will none of thee  Nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge  'Twixt man and man but thou thou meagre lead  Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught  Thy  plainness  Instead of  paleness  Johnson  moves me more than eloquence  And here chuse IJoy be the consequence  Portia's rapture on finding her favourite lover has chosen right is warmly and finely expressed in the next speech in which the danger of an excess of joy is also pointed out  How all the other passions fleet to air  As doubtful thoughts and rashembraced despair  And shuddering fear and greeneyed jealousy  O love be moderate allay thy extasy  In measure  rein  Rein  ▪ instead of  rain  Ditto  thy joy scant this excess  I feel too much thy blessing make it less  For fear I surfeit  In the fifth Scene following there is a ridiculous but whimsical description of a vain boasting young man many of which sort are to be met with in life in courts in camps in coffeehouses  Portia  and  Nerissa  going into boy's cloaths  Portia  I'll hold thee any wager  When we are both apparelled like young men  I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two  And wear my dagger with the braver grace  And speak between the change of man and boy  With a reed voice and turn two mincing steps  Into a manly stride and  speak of frays    Like a fine bragging youth  and tell quaint lies  How honourable ladies sought my love  Which I denying they fell sick and died  Then I'll repent  And wish for all that that I had not killed them  And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell  That men shall swear I've discontinued school  Above a twelvemonthI have in my mind  A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks  Which I will practise  ACT IV SCENE II  The character of Mercy is here most beautifully described This passage can never be too often read There is no danger of its growing  feared and tedious  Measure for Measure Act II Scene X  as Angelo says of the laws of justice  Portia  pleading for  Anthonio  The quality of Mercy is not strained  It droppeth as the gentle rain of heaven  Upon the place beneath It is twice blessed  It blesseth him that gives and him that takes  'Tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes  The throned monarch better than his crown  His sceptre shews the force of temporal power  The attribute to awe and majesty  Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings  But mercy is above this sceptred sway  It is enthroned in the hearts of kings  It is an attribute to God himself  And earthly po  er doth then shew likest God's  When mercy seasons justice Therefore Jew  Tho' justice be thy plea consider this  That in the course of justice none of us  Should see salvation We do pray for mercy  And that same prayer doth teach us all to render  The deeds of mercy  There is also a passage in the same Scene where the Pro and Con for partial justice is rightly argued  on both sides but terminates as I fear it should do for the safety of a State in stoical strictness  Bassanio  to  Portia  in the character of a Judge    And I beseech you  Wrest once the law to your authority  To do a great right do a little wrong  And curb this cruel devil of his will  Portia  It must not be there is no power in Venice  Should alter a decree established  'Twill be recorded for  a precedent    And many an error by the same example  Will rush into the State  It cannot be  We have also here some philosophic reflections on the advantages of dying before we are encumbered with age and poverty with a manly spirit of acquiescence in the unavoidable ills of life joined to the affecting tenderness and generous regards of friendship  Anthonio when the Jew has obtained sentence against him  I am armed and well prepared  Give me your hand Bassanio fare ye well  Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you  For herein Fortune shews herself more kind  Than is her custom It is still her use  To let the wretched man outlive his wealth  To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow  An age of poverty from which lingering penance  Of such a misery doth she cut me off  Commend me to your honourable wife  Tell her the process of Anthonio's end  Say how I loved you speak me fair in death  And when the tale is told bid her be judge  Whether Bassanio had not once a love  Repent not you that you shall lose your friend  And he repents not that he pays your debt  For if the Jew do cut but deep enough  I'll pay it instantly  with all my heart    'Tis a pity this fine speech should be disgraced by the quibble in the last expression  ACT V  SCENE I  The enchanting powers and effects of music are here most poetically set forth There can never be said too much on this charming theme Men's minds may be sometimes too stern or obstinate to yield to argument but in melody there is  a sort of sentiment  that sinks into the heart and by awaking the softer passions of the soul often persuades where reason else would fail  Lorenzo  and  Jessica  A Sound of Music  J  ssica  I'm never merry when I hear sweet music  Lorenzo  The reason is your spirits grow attentive  For do but note a wild and wanton herd  Or race of youthful and unhandled colts  Fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud  Which is the mad condition of their blood  If they perchance but hear a trumpet sound  Or any air of music touch their ears  You shall perceive them make a mutual stand  Their savage eyes turned to a modest gaze  By the sweet power of music Therefore the Poet  Did feign that Orpheus drew trees stones and floods  Since none so stickish hard and full of rage  But music for the time doth change his nature  The man that hath no music in himself  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds  Is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils  The motions of his spirit are dull as night  And his affections dark as Erebus  Let no such man be trusted  His niger est hunc tu Romane Caveto  HOR  There is also a beautiful allusion made to the light of a candle in this place which with the moral deduced from it is I think worthy to be noted here  Portia  and  Nerissa  Por  ia  How far that little candle throws its beams  So shines a good deed in a naughty world  So says the Scripture "Let your light so shine" And in the continuation of the same dialogue the effects of time circumstance comparison and occasion are beautifully and justly pointed out  Nerissa  When the moon shone we did not see the candle  Portia  So doth the greater glory dim the less  A substitute shines brightly as a king  Until a king be by and then his state  Empties itself as doth an inland brook  Into the main of waters Musick hark  Nerissa  It is your music Madam of the house  Portia  Nothing is good I see without  respect  That is reference to time place or other circumstance    Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day  Nerissa  Silence bestows the virtue on it Madam  Portia  The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark  When neither is attended and I think  The nightingale if she should sing by day  When every goose is cackling would be thought  No better a musician than the wren  How many things by season seasoned are  To their right praise and true perfection  The next quotation and the last I shall transcribe from this Play is in the same Scene where Portia accosts her husband's friend Anthonio on his first visit to her after the catastrophe of the piece has been wound up  Sir you are welcome to our house  It must appear in other ways than words  Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy  In this speech she very justly expresses the true sentiment of affection which renders professions needless where intentions are sincere  AS YOU LIKE IT  Dramatis Personae  MEN  A DUKE exiled from his dominions  AMIENS attending upon the Duke in his banishment  JAQUES attending upon the Duke in his banishment  A LORD

CORIN an old Shepherd  SYLVIUS a young one  WOMEN  ROSALIND Daughter to the Duke  CELIA Daughter to Frederick his Brother the Usurper  AS YOU LIKE IT  ACT I  SCENE I  THIS Play begins with a reflection on the  first  and I may add the  principal  concern in life the education of children Men are often more sedulous in training the brutes of their kennels their mews and their stables than they seem to be about the heirs of their blood their fortunes or their honours In sad truth may it be said that we seldom meet with a jockey an huntsman or a sportsman who is half so  wellbred  as his horses his hawks or his hounds  Orlando speaking of the unkindness of his elder brother and guardian says  For my part he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more properly  flies  me here at home unkept for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the  stalling of an ox  His horses are bred better for besides that they are fair with their feeding they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly hired but I his brother gain nothing under him but growth for the which the animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I Besides this Nothing that he so plentifully gives me the Something that Nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me He lets me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a brother and as much as in him lies mines  Mines  for  undermines  my gentility with my education  SCENE III  The last speech here though it presents us with no moral I cannot pass by without remarking that it seems to be a perfect description of our author's own character  Oliver speaking of Orlando his younger brother says  Yet he's gentle never schooled and yet learned full of noble device and of all sorts enchantingly beloved  SCENE IV  There are some passages very tender generous and affecting in the first part of the dialogue between Rosalind and Celia who had been bred up from their infancy in friendship together the first daughter to the exiled Duke and the other child to his brother the Usurper  Celia  I pray thee Rosalind sweet my coz be merry  Rosalind  Dear Celia I shew more mirth than I am mistress of and would you yet I were merrier Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure  Celia  Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight that I love thee If my uncle thy banished father had banished thy uncle the Duke my father so thou hadst been still with me I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine and so wouldst thou if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee  Rosalind  Well I will forget the condition of my estate and rejoice in yours  Celia  You know my father hath no child but me nor none is like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce I will render thee again in affectionBy mine honour I willAnd when I break that oath let me turn monsterTherefore my sweet Rose my dear Rose be merry  The same fondness between them is repeated in the tenth Scene of the same Act upon Rosalind's being commanded to quit the dominions of the Usurper  Celia  O my poor Rosalind where wilt thou go  Wilt thou change fathers I will give thee mine  I charge thee be not thou more grieved than I am  Rosalind  I have more cause  Celia  Thou hast not cousin  Prithee be chearful knowest thou not the Duke  Has banished me his daughter  Rosalind  That he hath not  Celia  No Hath not Rosalind lacks then the love  Which teacheth me that thou and I are one  Shall we be sundered Shall we part sweet girl  No let my father seek another heir  Therefore devise with me how we may fly  Whither to go and what to bear with us  And do not seek to take your change upon you  To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out  For by this heaven now at our sorrows pale  Say what thou canst I'll go along with thee  As there are many vices in morals that are injurious to society and which the laws have not stigmatized or possibly cannot sufficiently provide against the reprehensions of Satire under proper restrictions may perhaps be deemed a necessary supplement to legislation The most worthless person would chuse to sin in secret as not being able to endure the being rendered an object of public detestation or ridicule the fear of being  pointed  at has often laid a restraint on vice in which sense  the finger  may be said to be stronger than  the arm  Othello pathetically describes such a situation  But alas to make me  A fixed figure for the hand of Scorn  To point his slow unmoving finger at  The passage which gave rise to these reflections is in this fourth Scene where Celia interrupts Touchstone in his abuse of an absent person  Enough Speak no more of him you'll be whipt for taxation one of these days  Touchstone  The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly  Celia  By my troth thou sayest true for since the little wit that fools have was silenced  Alluding to the  jesters  that were formerly entertained by kings and were the only courtiers that were suffered to speak their minds  This office has been  ng abolished  the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show  SCENE VIII  There is a very proper hint given here to women not to deviate from the prescribed rules and decorums of their sex Whenever they venture to step  the least out of  their walk  in life they are too generally apt to  wander astray    Rosalind  Oh how full of briars is this workingday world  Celia  They are but burs cousin thrown upon thee in holiday foolery  if we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them    SCENE X  Rosalind speaking of disguising herself in man's apparel gives a good description of a swaggering bully  Were it not better  Because that I am more than common tall  That I did suit me a  l points like a man  A gallant curtleax upon my thigh  A boarspear in my hand and in my heart  Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will  I'll have a swashing and a martial outside  As many other mannish cowards have  That do outface it with their semblances  See Portia's speech in the fifth Scene Third Act of the Merchant of  in the Work for a parallel passage of female sportive humour    ACT II  SCENE I  The first speech in this Scene is rich in reflection upon the newmoulding faculty of use or habit the preference of a  sincere  country life to a  false  city one the advantages of adversity and the benefits of retired contemplation  The  Duke Amiens  and other Lords in the forest of  Arden    Duke  Now my comates and brothers in exile  Hath not  old  ust  m  made this life more sweet  Than that of painted pomp  See  observation on Scene IV Act V of The Two Gentlemen of  the power of Use or Habit  Are not these woods  More free from peril than the envious court  Here feel we but the penalty of Adam  The seasons' difference as the icy fang  And chur  sh chiding of the winter's wind  Which when it bites and blows upon my body  Even 'till I shrink with cold I smile and say  T  flattery  these are counsellors  That feelingly persuade me what I am  Sweet are the uses of adversity  Which like the toad ugly and venomous  Wears yet a precious jewel in his head  This was an ancient notion    And this our life exempt from public haunt  Finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks  Sermons in stones and good in every thing  I would not change it  Amiens  Happy is your Grace  That can translate the stubbornness of fortune  Into so quiet and so sweet a stile  In the continuation of the same dialogue some humane sentiments are thrown out on the subject of hunting with an affecting description given of a wounded deer and also some moral allusions from human life to the different circumstances and situations of the poor victim which must equally engage the thought and feeling of the reader  Duke  Come shall we go and kill us venison  And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools  Being native burghers of this desart city  Should in their own confines with forked heads  Have their round haunches gored  First Lord  Indeed my Lord  The melancholy Jaques  A character distinguished for humanity contemplation and contempt of the world and consequently for  singularity    grieves at that  And in that kind swears you no more usurp  Than doth your brother that hath banished you  That is  you usurp as much    To day my Lord of Amiens and myself  Did steal behind him as he lay along  Under an oak whose antique root peeps out  Upon the brook that brawls along this wood  To the which place a poor sequestered stag  That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt  Did come to languish and indeed my Lord  The wretched animal heaved forth such groans  That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat  Almost to bursting and the big round tears  Coursed one another down his innocent nose  In piteous chase  And thus the hairy fool  Much marked of the melancholy Jaques  Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook  Augmenting it with tears  Duke  But what said Jaques  Did he not moralize this spectacle  First Lord  O yes into a thousand similies  First for his weeping in the needless stream  Poor Deer quoth he thou makest a testament  As worldlings do giving thy sum of more  To that which had too much Then being alone  Left and abandoned of his velvet friends  'Tis right quoth he thus misery doth part  The flux of company Anon a careless herd  Full of the pasture jumps along by him  And never stays to greet himAy quoth Jaques  Sweep on ye fat and greasy citizens  'Tis just the fashion wherefore do you look  Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there  Thus most invectively he pierceth through  The body of the country city court  Yea and of this our life swearing that we  Are mere usurpers tyrants and what's worse  To  ight the animals and to kill them up  In their assigned and native dwelling place  Duke  And did you leave him in this contemplation  Second Lord  We did my Lord weeping and commenting  Upon the  o  bing Deer  Duke  Shew me the place  I love to cope him in these sullen fits  For then he's full of matter  Whoever could read the above description and  eat venison  on the same day must have a better stomach or a stouter heart than they would do well to boast ofSuch  melancholy  such  sullen fits  as these of Jaques have something more charming in them than all  "The broadest mirth unfeeling Folly wears"  SCENE III  The dangers of preeminence and virtue in a wicked and envious world are finely noted here  Adam meeting Orlando after he had conquered the Usurper's champion  What my young master Oh my gentle master  Oh my sweet master Oh you memory  Of old Sir Rowland why what make you here  Why are you virtuous Why do people love you  And wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant  Why would you be so fond to overcome  The boney prizer  Wrestler  of the humorous  For  humorsome    Duke  Your praise is come too swiftly home before you  Know you not master to some kind of men  Their graces serve them but as enemies  No more do yours  your virtues gentle master    Are sanctified and holy traitors to you  O what a world is this when what is comely  Envenoms him that bears it  When Adam counsels him to fly from the persecution of his cruel brother his answer expresses a noble and virtuous acquiescence in any state of misery or danger rather than submit to support himself by base or dishonest means  Orlando  What would'st thou have me go and beg my food  Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce  A thievish living on the common road  This I must do or know not what to do  Yet this I cannot do do how I can  I rather will subject me to the malice  Of a diverted  For  estranged    blood and bloody brother  There is a charming glow of affection gratitude and spirit in the reply made by Adam with a pleasing description of the virtue and sobriety of the antient Peasantry of England and the difference of manners and morals between those times and the more modern ones is well remarked upon  Adam  But do not soI have five hundred crowns  The thrifty hire I saved under your father  Which I did store to be my fosternurse  When service should in my old limbs lie lame  And unregarded age in corners thrown  Take that and  He that doth the ravens seed  Yea providentially caters for the sparrow  Be comfort to my age  Here is the gold  All this I give you  let me be your servant    Tho' I look old yet I am strong and lusty  For in my youth I never did apply  Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood  Nor did I with unbashful forehead woo  The means of weakness and debility  Therefore my age is as a lusty winter  Frosly but kindly  Cicero say  A well spert y  h s  d  an  ly age  Let me go with you  I'll do the business of a younger man  In all your business and necessities  Orlando  Oh good old man how well in thee appear  The constant service of the antique world  When service sweat for duty not for meed  Thou art not for the fashion of these times  Where none will sweat but for promotion  And having that do cloak their service up  Even with the having It is not so with thee  But poor old man thou prun'st a rotten tree  That cannot so much as a blossom yield  In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry  But come thy ways we'll go along together  And ere we have thy youthful wages spent  We'll light upon some settled low Content  Adam  Master go on and I will follow thee  To the last gasp with truth and loyalty  From seventeen years 'till now almost fourscore  Here lived I but now live here no more  At seventeen years many their fortune seek  But at fourscore it is too late a week  Yet fortune cannot recompence me better  Than to die well and not my master's debtor  SCENE IV  The nature and follies of love are here extremely well described between the several speakers  Silvius  O Corin that thou knewest how I do love her  Corin  I partly guess for I have loved ere now  Silv  us  No Corin being old thou canst not guess  Tho' in thy youth thou wast as true a lover  As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow  But if  hy love were ever like to mine  As sure I think did never man love so  How many actions most ridiculous  Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy  Corin  Into a thousand that I have forgotten  S  lviu    O thou didst then ne'er love so heartily  It thou rememberest not the slightest folly  That ever love did make thee run into  Thou hast not loved  Or if thou hast not sate as I do now  Wearing the hearer in thy mistress' praise  Thou hast not loved  Or if thou hast not broke from company  Abruptly as my passion now makes me  Thou hast not loved  O Phebe Phebe Phebe    Exit    Rosalind  Alas poor shepherd Searching of thy wound I have by hard adventure found my own  Touchstone  And I mine I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming anights to Jane Smile and I remember the kissing of her  batlet  Or  Beatle  a sort of mallet which washwomen beat the dirt out of coarse linens with in a pond or stream  and the cow's dugs that her pretty chopt hands had milked and I remember the wooing a peascod instead of her from whom I took two peas and giving her them again said with weeping tears Wear these for my sake We that are true lovers run into strange capers but as all is mortal in nature so is all nature in love  mortal  Mortal  for  abounding    Johnson  in folly  There is a very pretty poem on the same subject and which seems to have taken its hint from this passage in Shakespeare though the instances are different and more in number written by Miss  Aikin  among a collection of her's lately published which I would insert here but that I suppose every reader of taste must be in possession of a work which so well deserves a place in the most select libraries as doing equal honour to literature and her sex  See page    of her Poems  SCENE V  The common or modern modes of civility are well enough ridiculed here which however does not by any means reprove the fond expressions of affection or the warm returns of gratitude  Jaques  Well then if ever I thank any man I'll thank you but that they call compliments is like the encounter of two dogapes And when a man thanks me heartily methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks for it  In the same place the melancholy Jaques as he is characterized though he be of a gloomy and unsociable complexion himself describes a character in one word that in my opinion is still more unqualified for the converse of the world than his own  When he is told that the Duke has been all the day to look for him he replies  And I have been all this day to avoid him He is too  disputable  For  disputaticus    for my company I think of as many matters as he but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them  That is  I enjoy my own reflections but force not my thoughts or opinions upon others    SCENE VI  There is something extremely pathetic and affecting in this short scene between Orlando and Adam on their pilgrimage  Adam  Dear master I can go no further O I die for food Here lie I down and measure out my grave Farewell kind master  Orlando  Why how now Adam no greater heart in thee live a little comfort a little chear thyself a little If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage I will be either food for it or bring it for food to thee Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers For my sake be  comfortable  For  comforted    hold death awhile at the arm's end I will be here with thee presently and if I bring the  not something to eat I'll give thee leave to die but if thou diest before I come thou art a mocker of my labour Well saidthou lookest cheerly and I'll be with you quickly Yet thou liest in the bleak air Come I will bear thee to some shelter and thou shall not die for the lack of a dinner if there live any thing in this desert Cheerly good Adam  SCENE VII  Trite observations and commonplace morals are well exposed here  Jaques  As I do live by food I met a fool  Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun  And raised on lady Fortune in good terms  In good set termsand yet a motley fool  Good morrow fool quoth I No Sir quoth he  Call me not fool 'till Heaven hath sent me fortune  And then he drew a dial from his poke  And looking on it with lacklustre eye  Says very wisely  It is ten o'clock  Thus we may see  quoth he  how the world wags  'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine  And after one hour more 'twill be eleven  And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe  And then from hour to hour we rot and rot  Duke  What fool is this  Jaques  A worthy fool one that hath been a courtier  And says if ladies be but young and fair  They have the gift to know itAnd in his brain  Which is as dry as the remainder bisket  After a voyage he hath strange places crammed  With observations the which he vents  In mangled forms  In the same scene there is a good defence made for general satire  Jaques being accused of slander says  Why who cries out on pride  That can therein tax any private party  Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea  Till that the very very means do ebb  What woman in the city do I name  When that I say the citywoman bears  The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders  Who can come in and say that I mean her  When such a one as she such is her neighbour  Or what is he of basest function  That says his bravery is not on my cost  Thinking that I mean him but therein suits  His folly to the metal of my speech  There then how then what then let me see wherein  My tongue hath wronged for  if it do him right    Then he hath wronged himself if he be free  Why then my taxing like a wild goose flies  Unclaim'd of any man  See the last remark on Scene IV Act I of this Play  SCENE VIII  The following passage requires no comment to point out its beauties or to mark its impression  Orlando travelling through the forest with his poor old friend leaves him for a while to go in quest of food as shewn before in the last Scene but one and coming where the Duke and his train are at dinner draws his sword to force some of the viands from them The former Scene already quoted prepares us finely for Orlando's violence here which must otherwise have created disgust and seem to have been inconsistent with his expression in the third Scene above where he says to Adam  What would'st thou have me go and beg my food  Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce  A thievish living on the common road  Upon this challenge the Duke says  What would'st thou have Your gentleness shall force  More than your force move us to gentleness  Orlando  I almost die for food and let me have it  Duke  Sit down and feed and welcome to our table  Orlando  Speak you so gently Pardon me I pray you  I thought that all things had been savage here  And therefore put I on the countenance  Of stern commandment But whate'er you are  That in this desart inaccessible  Under the shade of melancholy boughs  Less and neglect the creeping hours of time  If ever you have looked on better days  If ever been where bells have knolled to church  If ever sate at any good man's feast  If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear  And kn  w what 'tis to pity▪ and be pitied  Let gentleness my strong enforcement be  In he which hope I blush and hide my sword  Duke  True is it that we have seen better days  And have with holy bell been knolled to church  And sate at good mens feasts  and wiped our eyes  Of dr  ps that sacred pity hath engendered  And therefore sit you down in gentleness  And take upon command what help we have  That to your wanting may be ministered  Orlando  Then but forbear your food a little while  Whiles like a doe I go to find my fawn  And give it food  There is an old poor man  Who after me hath many a weary step  Limped in pure love  'till he be first sufficed  Oppressed with two weak evils age and hunger  I will not touch a bit  Duke  Go find him out  And we will nothing waste till your return  Orlando  I thank ye and be blessed for your comfort  Exit  SCENE IX  On Orlando's going out the Duke says  Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy  This wide and universal theatre  Presents more woeful pageants than the scene  Wherein we play  Upon which allusion Jaques gives a fine picturesque and dramatic description of life and character in the following speech  All the world's a Stage  And all the men and women merely Players  They have their  exits  and their entrances  And one man in his time plays many parts  His Acts being seven ages  The old plays were divided into seven Acts  Warburton  At first the infant  Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms  And then the whining schoolboy with his satchel  And shining morning face creeping like snail  Unwillingly to school And then the lover  Sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad  Made to his mistress' eyebrow Then a soldier  Full of strange oaths and bearded like the Pard  Jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel  Seeking the bubble reputation  Even in the cannon's mouth And then the justice  In fair round belly with good capon lined  With eyes severe and beard of formal cut  Full of wise saws and modern instances  And so he plays his part The sixth age shifts  Into the lean and slippered Pantaloon  Alluding to that general character in the Italian Comedy    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side  His youthful hose well saved a world too wide  For his shrunk shank and his big manly voice  Turning again towards childish tremble pipes  And whistles in his sound Last scene of all  That ends this strange eventful history  Is second childishness and mere oblivion  Sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans every thing  SCENE X  Some melancholy reflections on the base vice and most heinous sin of ingratitude are sweetly comprized in the following Air  Blow blow the winter wind  That art not so unkind  As man's ingratitude  Thy tooth is not so keen  Because thou art not seen  Altho' thy breath be rude  Heigh ho heigh ho unto the green holly  Most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly  Then heigh ho the holly  This life is most jolly  This line is left without a comment in all the editions  or am I able to supply one upon it Such a life as is here described appears rather to be a  sad  than a  jolly  one I am as much at a loss also to guess why the  bolly  is particularly invoked here    Freeze freeze thou bitter sky  That dost not bite so nigh  As benefits forgot  Tho' thou the waters warp  Thy sting is not so sharp  As friend remembered not  Heigh ho c  ACT III  SCENE III  No situation of life is satisfactory to us there is something we like in all but none that we would chuse to take up with  for better for worse  This impatience this dissatisfaction in the mind of man proclaims aloud that this world was never designed as our place of rest and to refer us for it  to the grave  is but infidel mockery surely  I am well aware that after so serious a reflection the following passage may be deemed too slight an illustration of the remark but as it gave rise to it I think in justice that I ought to quote it here for even a straw is an argument of Providence to the contemplative mind  Corin  and  Touchstone  Corin  And how like you this shepherd's life Mr Touchstone  Touchstone  Truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good life but in respect that it is a shepherd's life it is naught In respect that it is solitary I like it very well but in respect that it is private it is a very vile life Now in respect that it is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in respect it is not in the court it is tedious As it is a spare life look you it fits my humour well but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much against my stomach  SCENE IV  The common singsong of poetry is well observed upon here such verses as Horace says a person may compose two hundred of  standing on one leg  Stans pede in  n    "without one thought to interrupt the song"  Rosalind reading a paper written in her praise  From the East to Western Inde  No jewel is like Rosalind  Her worth being mounted on the wind  Thro' all the world bears Rosalind  All the pictures fairest limned  Are but black to Rosalind  Let no face be kept in mind  But the face of Rosalind  Upon which Touchstone says  I'll rhime you so eight years together dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted It is the right butterwoman's rate to market This is the very false gallop of verses Why do you infect yourself with them  SCENE VIII  The different computations of time which are made by persons variously interested in its progression  are well and humorously described in this place  Rosalind  and  Orlando  Rosalind  I pray you what is't a clock  Orlando  You should ask me what time o'daythere's no clock in the forest  Rosalind  Then there's no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect  the lazy foot of time  as well as a clock  Orlando  And why not  the swift foot of time  Had not that been as proper  Rosalind  By no means Sir Time travels in divers paces with divers personsI'll tell you whom time trots withal whom time ambles withal whom time gallops withal and whom he stands still withal  Orlando  I prithee whom doth he trot withal  Rosalind  Marry he trots hard  By  hard  is meant  high  which is the most fatiguing rate to a traveller  with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized If the interim be but a se'nnight time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven years  Orlando  Whom ambles time withal  Rosalind  With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning and the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury These time ambles withal  Orlando  Whom doth he gallop withal  Rosalind  With a thief to the gallows for though he go softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there  Orlando  Who stays at withal  Rosalind  With lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves  SCENE X  Enter  Rosalind  and  Celia  Rosalind  Never talk to meI will weep  Celia  Do I prithee but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man  She was then dressed in a male habit    Rosalind  But have I not cause to weep  Celia  As good cause as one would desire therefore weep  Rosalind  His very hair is of the dissembling colour  Celia  Something browner than Judas'sMarry his kisses are Judas's own children  Rosalind  No faith his hair is of a good colour  Celia  An excellent colour Your chesnut was ever the only colour  Rosalind  And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy beard  Celia  He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana a Nun of Winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously the very ice of chastity is in them  The abrupt commencement of this dialogue leads us to suppose that it is but the continuation of one they had engaged in before their appearance in this scene in which Celia had been endeavouring to quiet Rosalind's fears upon her lover's having broke his promise of meeting her and whether from being tired with her obstinacy or resolving to try her sincerity she here seems to join in her resentment by agreeing with her in every thing which has an effect very natural in all such cases that the plaintiff immediately becomes defendant whenever the person beloved happens to be censured by any one else but themselves  Hermione says  My heart tho' full of rage was free from malice  And all my anger but excess of love  Distrest Mother    And the danger of interfering between man and wife I should hope arises from this principle Resentments may interrupt affection but they must rise to something more to cancel one that ever has been thoroughly conceived  SCENE XI  Rosalind  Foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer  This is a just thought and it would be well if it were more attended to No persons have a right to censure others who are not free from blame themselves This maxim if extended to the strictness of it would silence all scandal detraction and reproach  and indeed it has been often observed that the most faultless persons are generally the least severe Heaven has more mercy than man  ACT IV  SCENE I  As I have already given the reader some extracts of the character and sentiments of the  melancholy  Jaques in this Play which must give a favourable impression of him I think he will be well pleased to see him introduced once more particularly in a part where he gives a description of himself as he does in this scene and where the lively Rosalind also equally and justly condemns the extremes both of a merry and a grave complexion of mind and manners  Rosalind  and  Jaques  Rosalind  They say you are a melancholy fellow  Jaques  I am soI do love it better than laughing  Rosalind  Those who are in the extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards  Jaques  Why 'tis good to be sad and say nothing  Rosalind  Why then 'tis good to be a post  Jaques  I have neither the scholar's melancholy which is emulation nor the musician's which is fantastic nor the courtier's which is proud nor the soldier's which is ambitious nor the lawyer's which is politic nor the ladies which is nice nor the lover's  which is all these  but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels on which my often rumination wraps me in a most  humorous  H  for    sadness  Rosalind  And your experience makes you sad I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it too  Rosalind then taking advantage of the word  travel  gives a description of the  alamode pilgrims  of Shakespeare's times which may answer full as well for the fashionable  emigrants  of our own days  Farewel monsieur traveller look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with  your nativity and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are or I shall scarce think you have swam in a  Gondola  Venice was then the polite  goal  as Paris is now so that  to swim in a Con  old  is as if we should say  ride  in a  visavis  at present    There is something upon the whole of this sombre character of Jaques that is interesting and makes me recollect a French line of some  uncommon  because  ingenious and indulgent  Critic who says  Un esprit né chagrin plait par son chagrin même  SCENE V  There is no passion which Shakespeare more frequently or so poetically describes as that of love and as it is the one which by its despotism in our youthful years often forms the destiny of our future life and holds so immediate a relation to morals we should suffer no occasion to pass unnoticed however humorously or ludicrously expressed which either defines its nature or remarks upon its effects  Rosalind  No that same wicked bastard of Venus that was  begot of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness  that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes because his own are out let him be judge how deep I am in love I tell thee Aliena I cannot be out of the sight of OrlandoI'll go find a shadow  Shadow  for  shade  and sigh till he come  ACT V  SCENE V  The uncertainty of opinion in things where the mind is anxious is hinted at here  The  Duke  and  Orlando  Duke  Dost thou believe Orlando that the boy  Can do all this that he hath promised  Orlando  I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not  As those that fear they hope and now they fear  This line is thus amended by Dr Johnson    SCENE VI  Touchstone  to the  Duke  Rich honesty dwells like a miser Sir in a poor house as your pearl in your soul oyster  Men who pretend to know the world are apt to jo  n in the above satire upon mankind by saying what I am sorry to repeat that if we were to seek for honesty we must look for it as the Clown hints among the middle ranks of life  The punctilios of honour with regard to the false bravery or Gothic chivalry of duelling is admirably jested on in the same scene  Jaques  and  Touchstone  Jaques  But for the seventh cause how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause  Touchstone  Upon a lye seven times removed as thus Sir I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier's beard he sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well he was in the mind it was This is called the  retort courteous  If I sent him word again it was not well cut he would send me word he cut it to please himself This is called the  qu  p modest  If again it was not well cut he disabled my judgment This is called the  reply churlish  If again it was not well cut he would answer I spake not true This is called the  reproof valiant  If again it was not well cut he would say I lye This is called the  countercheck quarrelsome  And so the  lye circumstantial  and the  lye direct    Jaques  And how oft did you say that his beard was not well cut  Touchstone  I durst go no further than the  lye circumstantial  nor durst he give me the  lye direct  and so we measured swords and parted  I suppose this must have been an antient usage to see whether the combatants has entered the lifts upon equal terms of chivalry    Jaques  Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lye  Touchstone  O Sir we quarrel in print by the book as you have books for good manners I will name you the degrees The first the  retort courteous  the second the  quip modest  the third the  reply churlish  the fourth the  reproof valiant  the fifth the  c  u  beck quarrelsome  the sixth the  lye with circumstance  and the seventh the  lye direct  All these you may avoid but the  lye direct  and you may avoid that too with an  If  I knew when seven  justices could not make up a quarrel but when the parties were met themselves one of them thought but of an  If  as  If  you said so then I said so and they shook hands and swore brothers Your  If  is your only peacemakerMuch virtue in an  If    Doctor Warburton in a note on this passage has quoted a similar one from Fletcher in his Queen of Corinth  Has he familiarly  Disliked your yellow starch or said your doublet  Was not exactly frenchified or drawn your sword  Cried 'twas ill mounted has he given the lye  In  circle  or  oblique  or  semicircle  Or  direct parallel  you must challenge him  As the humorous satire of Don Quixote came abroad into the world in Shakespeare's time perhaps he might have taken a hint for this piece of ridicule from that writing and Fletcher may have copied his raillery from him again  Malta  is the only place now where the old Gothic chivalry is still preserved and that duelling is established by law  SCENE VII  I shall now conclude my remarks on this Play with a song in this Scene which comprehends my favourite moral  AIR  Wedding is great Juno's crown  O blessed bond of board and bed  'Tis Hymen peoples every town  High Wedlock then be honoured  Honour high honour and renown  To Hymen God of every town  LOVE's LABOUR

person whose character is above contempt is beautifully described and distinguished from false heroism in this place To conquer ourselves is greater than to vanquish others  The king of Navarre and three of his principal courtiers Biron Longaville and Dumain had determined upon a course of retirement and study for three years in order to fit themselves the better for their several departments in the state  King  Let Fame that all hunt after in their lives  Live registered upon our brazen tombs  And then grace us in the disgrace of death  When spite of cormorant devouring time  The endeavour of this present breath may buy  That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge  And make us heirs of all eternity  Therefore  brave conquerors  for so you are  That war against your own affections  And the huge army of the world's desires  Our late edict shall strongly stand in force  Navarre shall be the wonder of the world  Our court shall be a little academy  Still and contemplative in living arts  Longaville  I am resolved 'tis but a three years fast  The mind shall banquet tho' the body pine  Fat paunches have lean pates  and dainty bits  Make rich the ribs but banker out the wits  Dumain  My loving Lord Dumain is  mortified  Resigned to abstinence    The grosser manner of these world's delights  He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves  To love to wealth to pomp I pine and die  And these are living in philosophy  Biron speaking on this latter subject and justly condemning all study which is not made referable  to the real uses or moral purposes of life says  Study is like the Heaven's glorious sun  That will not be deep searched with saucy looks  What have continual plodders ever won  Save base authority from other's books  These earthly godfathers of Heaven's lights  That give a name to every fixed star  Have no more profit of their shining nights  Than those that walk and wot not what they are  Too much to know is to know nought but fame  And every godfather can give a name  And again  So study evermore is overshot  While it doth study to have what it would  It doth forget to do the thing it should  And when it hath the thing it hunteth most  'Tis won as towns with fire so won so lost  Seneca seems to be of the same opinion with our author where he says that  to desire more knowledge than is sufficient for us here is intemperance  Upon revising the articles of their mutual agreement they find that one of them must unavoidably be dispensed with on account of a particular reason of state that had not occurred to them in the drawing them up upon which the folly and danger of making vows is very justly descanted on  They are made  says Doctor Johnson on this passage  without sufficient regard to the variations of life and are therefore broken by some unforeseen necessity They proceed commonly from a presumptuous confidence and a false estimate of human power  Biron  Necessity  will make us all forsworn  Three thousand times within this three years space  For every man with his  affects  Passions c  is born  Not by might mastered but by special grace  If I break faith this word shall speak for me  I am forsworn on mere  necessity    In the same scene our author exposes an extraordinary and yet no uncommon character in life  The  King  and his Courtiers  King  Our court you know is haunted  With a refined traveller of Spain  A man in all the world's new fashion planted  That hath a mint of phrases in his brain  One whom the music of his own vain tongue  Doth ravish like enchanting harmony  A man of compliments whom  right and wrong  Have chose as umpire of their mutiny  This child of Fancy that Armado hight  For interim to our studies shall relate  In highborn words the worth of many a knight  From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate  How you delight my lords I know not I  But I protest I love to hear him lye  And I will use him for my minstrelsy  Biron  Armado is a most illustrious wight  A man of fine new words  Fashion's own knight    The making  right and wrong  equally to chuse him for their arbitrator is an admirable trait of an obsequious disposition And since we are upon this subject here I think it will be better to groupe the rest of the characters in this Play together in this place though they refer to different scenes in it  In the Third Scene of this Act there is a description which proves that one of the characteristics of the present age is not quite  so modern  as one might otherwise be apt to imagine  Moth  You are  a gentleman and a gamester  Abbe Le Blanc speaking of the English passion for  Gaming  says  they have a way of getting rich with little pains or begga  ing themselves with little pleasure    Armado  I confess both they are both the varnish of a  compleat man    In another place Act II Scene I in a dialogue between the princess Maria Catharine and Rosaline speaking of the courtiers Maria says  In Normandy saw I this  Longaville    A man of sovereign parts he is esteemed  Well fitted in the arts glorious in arms  Nothing becomes him ill that he would well  The only foil of his fair virtue's gloss  If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil  Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will  Whose edge hath power to cut whose will still will▪  It should spare none that come within his power  Princess  Some merrymocking lord belikeIs't so  Maria  They say so most that most his humours know  Princess  Such shortlived wits do wither as they grow  The latter part of the character of Longaville above described is an unhappy quality frequently to the persons themselves who happen to be infected with it It often makes enemies but never once a friend Even those who are the most maliciously pleased with it against others still fear it against themselves Sterne's comparison of the  jester and jestee  to the  mortgager and mortgagee  In his  Trif  o  Shardy  is an excellent and just allusion The one may forget the debt but the other will not only remember but exact the penalty when  payday  comes  A  personal satirist  may be likened to a  hatchetman  sitting on the arm of a tree with his face turned to the trunk and cutting away before him who when he has dismembered the branch falls to the ground himself along with it  Princess  Who are the rest  Catharine  The young Dumain a wellaccomplished youth  Of all that virtue love for virtue loved  Most power to do most harm least knowing ill  For he hath wit to make an ill shape good  And shape to win grace tho' he had no wit  I saw him at the duke Alenson's once  And much too little of that good I saw  Is my report to his great worthiness  Rosaline  Another of these students at that time  Was there with him as I have heard o'truth  Biron they called him but a merrier man  Within the limit of becoming mirth  I never spent an hour's talk withal  His eye begets occasion for his wit  For every object that the one doth catch  The other turns to a mirthmoving jest  Which his fair tongue conceit's expositor  Delivers in such apt and gracious words  That aged ears play truant at his tales  And younger hearings are quite ravished  So sweet and voluble is his discourse  Lastly In the first Scene of Act IV there are two characters which appear the better for being placed in contrast with each other  Nathanael  and  Holofernes  Nathanael  I praise God for you Sir your  reasons  Discourse  or  conversation  at dinner have been sharp and sententious pleasant without scurrility witty without affectation  audacious  Animated  without impudency learned without  opinion  Opinionativeness  and  strange  New  without heresy I did converse this quondamday with a companion of the king's who is intitled nominated or called Don Adriano d'Armado  Holofernes  His humour is lofty his discourse peremptory his tongue filed his eye ambitious his gait majestical and his general behaviour vain ridiculous and thrasonical He is too piqued too spruce too affected too odd as it were too peregrinate as I may call it He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument I abhor such fanatical phantasms such unsociable and  pointdevise  companions such rackers of Orthography as to speak  dout  fine when he should say  doubt det  when he should pronounce debt d e b t not d e t He clepeth a  calf caulf half haulf neighbour  vocatur  nebour neigh  abbreviated  ne  This is  abominable  which he would pronounce  abhominable  It insinuates me of infanity to be mad frantic  But to return The pedantry of scholastic definitions and the verbose stile of law writings are properly ridiculed in the second Scene of the First Act in part of Armado's letter to the king giving an information of an offence committed against one of his statutes  So it isBesieged with fablecoloured melancholy I did commend the black oppressing humour to the most wholesome physic of  thy healthgiving air and as I am a gentleman betook myself to walk The time when About the sixth hour when beasts most graze birds best peck and men sit down to that nourishment which is called supperSo much for the time whenNow for the ground whichWhich I mean I walked uponIt is yeleped thy park Then for the place whereWhere I mean I did encounter that obscene and most preposterous event that draweth from my snowwhite pen the eboncoloured ink which here thou viewest beholdest surveyest or seestBut to the place where It standeth northnortheast and by east from the west corner of thy curiousknotted garden There did I see that lowspirited swain that base minion of thy mirth that unlettered smallknowing soul that shallow vas  al which as I remember hight  Costard  sorted and consorted contrary to thy established proclaimed edict and continent canon with a child of our grandmother  Eve  a female or for thy more understanding a woman Him have I sent to thee to receive the meed of punishment c  In the last Scene of this First Act there is a quaint description given of Love but as it is spoken in the person of Armado whose affected character has been already exposed I shall insert it here  Love is a familiar love is a devil there is no evil angel but loveYet was Sampson so tempted and he had an excellent strength yet was Solomon so seduced and he had a very good wit Cupid's Butshaft is too hard for Hercules's club and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapierThe passado he respects not the duello he regards notHis disgrace is to be called boy but his glory is to subdue men  ACTS II and III  What is worth noting in the Second Act has already been included in our excursion from the First and the Third affords us no matter for observation  ACT IV  SCENE I  The false glory of antient heroism is justly censured in the latter part of the following speech  The Princess taking the bow to go a stagshooting thus argues with herself on a supposition either of her hitting or missing the quarry  Thus will I save my credit on the shoot  Not wounding pity would not let me do't  If wounding then it was to shew my skill  That more for praise than purpose meant to kill  And out of question so it is sometimes  Glory grows guilty of detested crimes  When for fame's sake for praise an outward part  We bend to that the working of the heart  As I for praise alone now seek to spill  The poor Deer's blood that my heart means no ill  SCENE IV  Part of a speech here is very worthy of a quotation first as it is one of the many fond descriptions of love given us by our Author and next as it shews the effects of this passion in higher instances than any of his former ones by urging its advantages to the minds and manners as well as its operations upon the affections of men and in this light it may be considered as a good comment on the fable of Cymon and Iphigenia  Biron speaking to the King Dumain and Longaville after they had all fallen in love against the phlegmatic and fruitless study of monastic life in a seclusion from all female converse says  For when would you my liege or you or you  In  leaden  contemplation have found out  Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes  Of beauteous tutors have enriched you with  Other slow arts intirely keep the brain  And therefore finding barren practisers  Scarce shew a harvest of their heavy toil  But love first learned in a lady's eyes  Lives not alone immured in the brain  But with the motion of all elements  Courses as swift as thought in every power  And gives to every power a double power  Above their functions and their offices  It adds a precious seeing to the eye  A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind  A lover's ear will hear the lowest  ound  When the suspicious  hand  of theft is stopt  The fears of a thief are naturally alarmed upon the slightest noise I have ventured to alter  head  to  hand  in the above line    Love's feeling is more soft and sensible  Than are the tender horns of cockled snails  Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus ross in taste  For  flavour  The word in the text is  valour  but Theobald changes it to  savour  in order to compleat the enumeration of the senses and I prefer the word  flavour  as this refers more to fruits as the other to viands  is not love an Hercules  Still climbing trees in the Hesperides  Subtle as Sphinx as sweet and musical  As bright Apollo's lute strung with his hair  And when love speaks the voice of all the Gods  Make heaven drowsy with the harmony  Never durst poet touch a pen to write  Until his ink were tempered with love's  tears  I prefer  tears  to  s  hs  which is the text word as water is a fitter element than wind to temper ink withThe last word of the next line I have also changed from  ears  to  breasts  in order to elude the rhime    O then his lines would ravish savage  breasts    And plant in tyrants mild humanity  The text word is  humility  I have ventured to change it to one that is more fitly opposed to  tyranny      From women's eyes this doctrine I derive  They sparkle still the right Promethean fire  They are the books the arts the academies  That shew contain and nourish all the world  Else none at all in aught proves excellent  ACT V  SCENE III  That persons of the best understandings are generally remarked to be the greatest fools in love the superiority of their talents adding strength to their passion is well noted in the following observations which as Doctor Johnson says upon this passage  are worthy of a man who has surveyed human nature with the closest attention  The  Princess Rosaline  and  Maria  Princess  None are so surely caught when they are catched  As wit turned fool folly in wisdom hatched  Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school  And wits' own grace to grace a learned fool  Rosaline  The blood of youth burns not in such excess  As gravity's revolt to wantonness  Maria  Folly in fools bears not so strong a note  As foo'ery in the wise when wit doth dote  Since all the power thereof it doth apply  To prove by wit worth in simplicity  These ladies seem to speak very philosophically upon this subject but might yet have improved  their lecture by observing on as certain a fact still more extraordinary which is that to render a man of sense the compleatest slave in love he must be captivated  by a fool  provided she has what is generally met with in persons of that character a proper proportion of art or cunning  Sense is always a match for sense and can be overreached by folly only as here no danger is apprehended to put a man on his guard the fair one's wiles seeming to be all nature  naïveté  and charming simplicity and 'tis natural to humour those fondlings whom 'tis thought vain to reason with  SCENE X  I shall finish my remarks on this Play with a passage in this Scene which continues the subject above last mentioned and is a further description of the nature and effects of that passion  Biron to the ladies  For your fair sakes have we neglected time  Played foul play with our oaths your beauty ladies  Hath much deformed us fashioning our humours  Even to the opposed end of our intents  And what in us hath seemed ridiculous  As love is full of unbefitting strains  All wanton as a child skipping in vain  Formed by the eye and therefore like the eye  Full of straying shapes of habits and of forms  Varying in subjects as the eye doth rowl  To every fancied object in his glance  With partycoated presence of loose love  Put on by us if in your heavenly eyes  Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities  Those heav'nly eyes that look into those faults  Suggested us to make them  THE WINTER's TALE  Dramatis Personae  MEN  LEONTES King of Sicilia  POLIXENES King of Bohemia  FLORIZEL Prince of Bohemia  CAMILLO Sicilian Lords  CLEOMINES Sicilian Lords  Another Sicilian Lord  ARCHIDAMUS a Bohemian Lord  A GENTLEMAN  AUTOLICUS a Sharper  CLOWN  WOMEN  HERMIONE Queen of Sicilia  PERDITA Daughter to Leontes and Hermione  PAULINA a Lady of the Sicilian Court  THE WINTER's TALE  ACT I  SCENE I  THE rational sociable and friendly manner in which crowned heads used formerly to live pleasantly with one another is described hereWhy is it no longer so Does modern polity oppose itself to humanity Kings may have mistresses indeed but friend or favourite they must have none What amends can the whole  regalia  of their solitary pomp afford them for being denied one of the sweetest the dearest and the most virtuous enjoyments of life a manly sympathy of affections and a chaste intercourse of souls Modern kings may say as Richard the Third did  I am myself alone Incedo solus  but not in the happy sense that Horace meant itthe  quacunque libido est  is wanting  Camillo  Sicilia cannot shew himself overkind to Bohemia they were trained together in their childhoods and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which cannot chuse but branch now Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society their encounters though not personal have been royally attornied with interchange of gifts letters loving embassies that they have seemed to be together though absent shook hands as over a vast and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds The heavens continue their loves  Archidamus  I think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it  The passion in mankind for life and the pretences they make to themselves for still wishing to defer their departure from time to time is well enough pointed out in the following passage  Camillo speaking of the young Prince of Sicilia says  He makes old hearts fresh they that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man  Archidamus  Would they else be content to die  Camillo  Yes if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live  Archidamus  If the king had no son they would desire to live on crutches till he had one  SCENE II  The happy state of youth and consequently of innocence is here well described  Polixenes  We were fair Queen  Two lads that thought there was no more behind  But such a day tomorrow as today  And to be boy eternal  We were as twinned lambs that did frisk i' th' sun  And bleat the one at th' other what we changed  Was innocence for innocence we knew not  The doctrine of illdoing no nor dreamed  That any didHad we pursued that life  And our weak spirits ne'er been higher reared  With stronger blood we should have answered heaven  Boldly  not guilty the imposition cleared  Setting aside  the Fall of Man    Hereditary ours  SCENE III  When Leontes having conceived a jealousy of Polixenes commands Camillo whom he had appointed cupbearer to his guest to poison him this good man makes an admirable reflection on disloyalty and rebellion in the following soliloquy  Camillo  If I could find example  Of thousands that had struck anointed kings  And flourished after I'd not do't but since  Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one  Let villainy itself forswear it  ACT II  SCENE III  The dumb rhetoric of innocence is finely noted here When Paulina the Queen's friend purposes  to present the newborn child of Leontes before him in hopes of abating his resentment against its mother she says  We do not know  How he may soften at the sight o' th' child  The silence often of pure innocence  Persuades when speaking fails  ACT III  SCENE II  The unhappy Queen of Sicilia when she is called upon her public trial for a supposed adultery speaks with a noble spirit of parental sentiment on the occasion  Hermione  Behold me  A fellow of the royal bed which  owe  For  own    A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter  The mother to a hopeful prince here standing  To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore  Who please to come and hear For life I prize it  As I weigh grief which I would spare  For honour    'Tis a derivative from me to mine  And only that I stand for  The beautiful sentiment expressed in the last lines which must draw tears of pity from virtuous mothers and should those of another kind from vicious ones puts me in mind of a parallel passage in Scripture  A mother in dishonour is a reproach to her children  Ecclesiasticus Chapter iii verse    SCENES III and IV  The sudden ebbs of warm and violent tempers with the  revealing  nature of a guilty conscience which is apt to confess its crime even before 'tis charged with it as Leontes does here with regard to the intended murder of Polixenes which remained yet a secret in his own breast are strongly depicted in this Scene  Leontes on hearing that his son had died of grief and seeing his wife fall into a swoon on that  event is suddenly struck with compassion and remorse  Leontes  Apollo's angry and the heavens themselves  Do strike at my injusticeHow now there  Hermione  faints    Paulina  This news is mortal to the queenLook down  And see what death is doing  Leontes  Take her hence  Her heart is but o'ercharged she will recover  Exeunt  Paulina  and Ladies with  Hermione    I have too much believed my own suspicion  'Beseech you tenderly apply to her  Some remedies for life Apollo pardon  My great prophaneness 'gainst thy oracle  Which had vouched the innocence of Hermione    I'll reconcile me to Polixenes  New woo my queen recall the good Camillo  Whom I proclaim a man of truth of mercy  For being transported by my jealousies  To bloody thoughts and to revenge I chose  Camillo for the minister to poison  My friend Polixenes which had been done  But that the good mind of Camillo tardied  My swift command tho' I with death and with  Reward did threaten and encourage him  Not doing it and being done he most humane  And filled with honour to my kingly guest  Unclasped my practice quit his fortunes here  Which you knew great and to the certain hazard  Of all incertainties himself commended  No richer than his honourNow he glisters  Through my dark rust and now his piety  Does my deeds make the blacker  SCENE V  Paulina too being likewise a person of strong passions and an ungovernable temper shews as quick a revulsion in the midst of her rage against Leontes upon finding him repentant though she had even told him the moment before that neither penance nor penitence itself could aught avail him  Lord  Say no more  Howe'er the business goes you have made fault  I'th' boldness of your speech  This fault is reprehended before by Gonzalez in the Tempest Act I Scene I See the second speech there in this Work    Paulina  I am sorry for't  All faults I make when I shall come to know them  I do repentAlas I've shewed too much  The rashness of a woman he is touched  To the nobler heart What's gone and what's past help  Should be past grief Do not receive affliction  At my petition I beseech you rather  Let me be punished that have minded you  Of what you should forget Now good my Liege  Sir royal Sir forgive a foolish woman  The love I bore your queenlo fool again  I'll speak of her no morenor of your children  I'll not remember you of my own lord  Who is lost too  sake you your patience to you  And I'll say nothing  Though I cannot help observing here that her vindictive spirit appears plainly not to have yet subsided but only taken a different course by the latter part of her speech for she continues still to accumulate her charges against him as if only by way of enumerating the articles of her forgiveness  Our Author who almost every where manifests a perfect knowledge in the anatomy of the human mind proves his science more particularly in a passage of this Scene by shewing a property in our natures which might have escaped any common dissecter of morals and this is our suffering upon true penitence and contrition not only all reproach thrown out against us with meekness and submission but even encouraging and augmenting the abuse by joining in our own condemnation This may possibly arise from a strong wish or sanguine hope that such a voluntary penance may in part be accepted both by heaven and the world as some sort of atonement for our crimes  Leontes while Paulina is arraigning him with the utmost virulence and severity instead of having her cast out from his presence cries  Go on go on  Thou canst not speak too much I have deserved  All tongues to talk their bitterest  Again when she seems to relent of her severity towards him  Thou did'st say but well  When most the truth which I receive much better  Than to be pitied of thee Prithee bring me  To the dead bodies of my queen and son  One grave shall be for both Upon them shall  The causes of their deaths appear unto  Our shame perpetual once a day I'll visit  The chapel where they lie and tears shed there  Shall be my recreation So long as nature  Will bear up with this exercise  So long I daily vow to use it Come  And lead me to these sorrows  In the First Scene of the Fifth Act the same subject is renewed where Leontes manifests the same humiliation and contrition for his crime that he did before but as an interval of sixteen years spent in sorrow and repentance had passed between these two aeras he as would be natural then shews an uneasiness at the reproach and intreats to be relieved from it for the future but this in a manner so gentle and submissive as none but Shakespeare himself could have conceived The whole passage is worthy of being quoted  Leontes Cleomines  and  Paulina  Cleomines  Sir you have done enough and have performed  A saintlike sorrow no fault you could make  Which you have not redeemed indeed paid down  More penitence than done trespass At the last  Do as the Heavens have done forget your evil  With them forgive yourself  Leontes  Whilst I remember  Her and her virtues I cannot forget  My blemishes in them and so still think of  The wrong I did myself which was so much  That heirless it hath made my kingdom and  Destroyed the sweet'st companion that e'er man  Bred his hopes out of  Paulina  True too true my lord  If one by one you wedded all the world  Or from the All that are took something good  To make a perfect woman  she you killed    Would be unparalleled  Leontes  I think so Killed  Killed She I killed I did soBut thou strik'st me  Sorely to say I didIt is as bitter  Upon thy tongue as in my thought  Now good now    Say so but seldom  ACT IV  SCENE IV  There is a poetical history of love given here which closes with a beautiful description of a chaste and pure passion in a lover  Florizel  The gods themselves  Humbling their deities to love have taken  The shapes of beasts upon them Jupiter  Became a bull and bellowed the green Neptune  A ram and bleated and the firerobed god  Golden Apollo a poor humble swain  As I seem now Their transformations  Were never for a piece of beauty rarer  Nor in a way so chaste  since my desires  Run not before mine honour nor my lusts  Burn hotter than my faith  SCENE V  Here is a passage that I am particularly fond of because it vindicates the rights of Nature even over those arts which seem to vie and cooperate with her for her  general laws  can never be controlled but by  bye ones  of her own making  Perdita  and  Polixenes  Perdita  The fairest flowers o' th' season  Are our carnations and streaked gillyflowers  Which some call Nature's bastards of that kind  Our rustic garden's barren and I care not  To get slips of them  Polixenes  And wherefore gentle maiden  Do you neglect them  Perdita  For I have heard it said  There is an art which in their piedness shares  With great creating Nature  I have been told that different coloured silk threads inserted in the roots would have this effect    Polixenes  Say there be  Yet Nature is made better by no mean  But Nature makes that mean  so over that art  Which you say adds to Nature  is an art    That Nature makes  you see sweet maid we marry  A gentler scyon to the wildest stock  And make conceive a bark of baser kind  By bud of nobler race This is an art  Which does mend Nature  change it  ratherbut  The art itself is nature  Perdita  So it is  Polixenes  Then make your garden rich in gillyflowers  And do not call them bastards  Perdita  I'll not put  The dibble  A setting stick  in earth to set one slip of them  No more than were I painted I would wish  This  Florizel standing by  youth should say 'twere well and only therefore  Desire to breed by me  I have continued the above dialogue beyond the philosophy of its subject in order to treat my reader with one of the most refined sentiments of a chaste and delicate mind that can possibly be conceived Perdita shews a charming genuineness of nature in her latter speech for though she confesses the truth of Polixenes' position yet is she so jealous of the honour of our great parent that even the appearance of a violation against her rights offends her And the parallel she makes upon the occasion is beautiful Readers see not half the  greatness  of Shakespeare who overlook his  minutiae    In the same scene the praise that Florizel bestows on Perdita is equally fond and beautiful  What you do  Still betters what is done When you speak sweet  I'd have you do it ever when you sing  I'd have you buy and sell so so give alms  Pray so and for the ord'ring your affairs  To sing them too When you do dance I wish you  A wave o' th' sea that you might ever do  Nothing but that move still still so  And own no other function Each your doing  So singular in each particular  Crowns what your doing in the present deeds  That all your acts are queens  To which she replies with very good sense and prudence  O  Doricles    Your praises are too large but that your youth  And the true blood which peeps forth fairly through it  Do plainly give you out an unstained shepherd  With wisdom I might fear my Doricles  You woo'd me the false way  In answer to this he says  I think you have  As little skill to fear  As little skill to fearAs little suspicion in your nature  as I have purpose  To put you to't  This is the true character of youth in the different sexes Sincerity on one side and confidence on the other Deceit and diffidence are the fruits of  riper  or more  rotten  years  SCENE IX  There is a reflection made here which if true would be one of the heaviest articles of affliction  Camillo  and  Perdita  Camillo  Prosperity's the very bond of love  Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together  Affliction alters  But I shall rather hope and believe with the charming Perdita in the faith and fidelity she expresses in her reply  One of these is true  I think affliction  may subdue the cheek  But not take in the mind  SCENE XI  There is a good ridicule here on the affectations of persons of rank in the description of the manners by which the vulgar often distinguish their  betters  perhaps their  superiors  only  The old shepherd and his son upon seeing Autolicus the sharper dressed up in a suit of the prince's cloaths debate thus about him  Son  This cannot be but a great courtier  Shepherd  His garments are rich but he wears them not handsomely  Son  He seems to be the more noble  in being fantastical  A great man I'll warrant  I know by the picking of his teeth    ACT V  SCENE I  There is a good remark made here on the wrong timing of reproof in the speech of Cleomines to Paulina upon her rough treatment of Leontes on the subject of his misfortunes when she is dissuading him from marrying  You might have spoke a thousand things that would  Have done the time more benefit and graced  Your kindness better  SCENE V  This Comedy is full of welldescribed character and beautiful description but these not happening to fall within the scope I had prescribed to myself in this work I have reluctantly passed them by without noting However there is one passage among them which luckily affords me a proper subject of remark in the account given of Leontes and Camillo on their being certified of the preservation of Perdita  Autolicus  and a  Gentleman  Autolicus  Beseech you Sir were you present at this relation  Gentleman  I was by at the opening of the fardel and heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it whereupon after a little amazedness we were all commanded out of the chamber Only this methought I heard the shepherd say he found the child  Autolicus  I would most gladly know the issue of it  Gentleman  I make a broken delivery of the business but the changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were very notes of admiration they seemed almost with staring on one another to tear the cases of their eyes There was a speech in their dumbness language in their very gesture  they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed or one destroyed  a notable passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if the importance were joy or sorrow but in the extremity of the one it must needs be  This description not only contains the beautiful and the sublime but rises to a still higher sublimity or to speak in the stile of the Psalmist to the  most  highest  in the allusion to sacred writ relating to the two principal articles in the Old and New Testament the fall of man and his redemption Shakespeare makes frequent references to the sacred text and writes often not only as a moralist but as a divine  Autolicus having by accident had some hand in bringing about the discovery of Perdita which was a circumstance that might have been sufficient to make another man's fortune makes only this sad soliloquy upon the occasion  Now had I not the dash of my former life in me would preferment drop on my head  I brought the old man and his son aboard the Prince told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know not what but he at that time overfond of the shepherd's daughter so he then took her to be who began to be much seasick and himself little better extremity of weather continuing this mystery remained undiscovered  But 'tis all one to me for had I been the finder out of this secret it would not have relished among my other discredits  That  honesty is the best policy  is a homely proverb but this only the more vouches the truth of it by its having stood the test of all experience Character is the  immediate jewel of the soul  not only in its own worth but even in the temporal advantages which frequently accrue from it Lost health may be repaired lost fortune be regained even lost senses may be recovered but a forfeited character is rarely ever to be retrieved  This is a theme which cannot be too largely or too frequently expatiated upon which I hope will serve as my apology for having taken the hint from so mean and trifling an instance as the foregoing  SCENE VI  The old shepherd and his son having by the medium of the princess Perdita obtained into favour at Court Autolicus asks forgiveness of the Clown for the tricks he had played him  I humbly beseech you Sir to pardon me all the faults I have committed to your worship and to give me your good report to the prince my master  This request is seconded by the old man in words which describe the proper character of that rank of life to which he had been just elevated  Sh  pherd  Prithee son do  for we must be gentle now we are gentlemen    But 'tis pity that the conduct and behaviour of too many in so respectable a class should afford cause for the severe sarcasm couched in the following words of the son  Clown  Give me thy hand    to Autolicus    I will  swear  to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia  Shepherd  You may  say  it but not  swear  it  Clown  Not swear it now I am a gentleman  Let boors and franklins  Yeemen  say  it I'll  swear  it  Shepherd  How if it be false son  Clown  If it be ne'er so false a true gentleman may swear it on the behalf of his friend  SCENE VII  Paulina says to Leontes on perceiving him to be strongly affected on seeing Hermione represented so much to the life as a supposed statue  I'm sorry Sir I have thus far stirred you but I could  Afflict you further  To which he replies  Do Paulina  For this affliction has a taste as sweet  As any cordial comfort  This is spoken with a true sense of a propitiatory and a contrite grief A sincere repentance is indeed an healing balm to the wounded conscience a  cordial comfort  to the soul  TWELFTH NIGHT OR WHAT YOU WILL  Dramatis Personae  MEN  DUKE of Illyria  SEBASTIAN brother to Viola  ANTONIO friend to Sebastian  VALENTINE an attendant on the Duke  CLOWN servant to Olivia  WOMEN  OLIVIA beloved by the Duke  VIOLA in love with the Duke  Twelfth Night or What You Will  ACT I  SCENE I  THIS Play opens with a sweet passage in which the charms of music and the nature of love are beautifully described  Duke  If music be the food of love play on  Give me excess of it that surfeiting  The appetite may sicken and so die  That strain againIt had a dying fall  O it came o'er my ear like the sweet south  That breathes upon a bank of violets  Stealing and giving odour Enough no more  'Tis not so sweet now as it was before  O spirit of love how quick and fresh art thou  That notwithstanding thy capacity  Receiveth as the sea nought enters there  Of what validity and pitch soe'er  But falls into abatement and low price  Even in a minute so full of shapes in fancy  That it alone is  hight  Hight  yeleped or called instead of  high Warburton  fantastical  As I have hitherto observed upon Shakespeare's critical knowledge in human nature I hope it will not appear invidious now if I should here remark upon his deficiency in a passage abovelines second and third The duke is there made to wish his passion were extinct which I believe the most unhappy lover never yet did We wish to remove every uneasy sensation it afflicts us with by any means whatever sometimes even by death itself but never by the extinction of the affection  This is not peculiar to love alone 'tis the same in all the tender feelings We wish the object of our grief brought back again to life but desire not to forget our sorrow We wish to relieve the subjects of our pity but would not be deprived of our compassion  Heaven hath so framed us and Heaven be praised for having endowed and adorned us with such  sweet compunctious visitings of Nature  'tis in these features only that we can resemble our Maker In the more heroic qualities of bravery and fortitude can be traced no likeness of the Deity because superfluous in a perfect state The subject of love is touched upon again twice in the same Scene  Duke  O when my eyes did see Olivia first  Methou  ht she purged the air of pestilence  That instant was I turned into a hart  And my desires like fell and cruel hounds  E'er since pursue me  A fine allusion to the story of Act  on and a beautiful exposition of the sable    And when Valentine acquaints the Duke with Olivia's vow of sequestering herself from the world for seven years to mourn the death of her brother he cries out in an extasy  O she that hath an heart of that fine frame  To pay this debt of love but to a brother  How will she love when the rich golden shaft  Hath killed the flock of all affections else  That live in her When liver brain and heart  Three sovereign thrones are all supplied and filled  O sweet perfection with one selfsame king  I am happy that this latter passage happens to occur so immediately after my remark above as it affords me an opportunity of doing justice to Shakespeare by observing that his inference from Olivia's grief to the nature of her heart in love shews a perfect knowledge in this species of philosophy The passions are divided into but two classes the tender and the violent and any one of either affords an earnest of all others of the same kind  His distinction too of the  three thrones  the  liver brain  and  heart  is admirable These are truly the seats of the three chief affections of love the heart for passion the mind for esteem and the liver for jealousy if Horace's anatomy is to be credited  Diff  h b  e tu  je  r    SCENE XI  In the last speech of this Act Olivia speaks in the usual manner of all infatuated persons who are apt to make the Fates answerable for those follies or vices which they have not sense or virtue enough to extricate themselves from by their own exertions For upon a consciousness of having too weakly betrayed her passion for Viola appearing under the character of a cavalier she acquiesces in her indiscretion by saying  I do I know not whatand fear to find  Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind  That my eye has revealed a secret which my mind should have concealed  Johnson    Fate shew thy force ourselves we do not owe  For  own  or are  masters  of    What is decreed must beand this be so  She repeats the same idle apology for herself again in the second Scene of the next Act  For such as we are made if such we be  Alas our frailty is the cause not we  ACT II SCENE VI  There are some good rules and reflections here upon that principal and interesting event of life our marriage which are well worth attending to as the natural consequences of an improper assortment in that state have been too strongly marked by the general experience of the world  Duke  and  Viola  as a Man  Duke  Let still the woman take  An elder than herself so wears she to him  So sways she level in her husband's heart  For boy  however we do prize ourselves  Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm  More longing wavering sooner lost and won  Than women's are  Viola  I think it well my lord  Duke  Then let thy love be younger than thyself  Or thy affection cannot hold the bent  For women are as roses whose fair flower  Being once display'd doth fall that very hour  Viola  And so they areAlas that they are so  To die even when they to perfection grow  ACT III  SCENE I  There is a slight stroke thrown out here against an affected refinement on common speech which however I shall lay hold of as one should animadvert upon every species of pedantry which is an incumbrance to literature and casts a damp upon all free and liberal conversation  Clown  My lady is within Sir I will  construe  to her whence you came who you are and what you would is out of my  welkin  I might say  element  but the word is  overworn    SCENE XIV  There is a most delicate sensibility expressed by a person here in his reproach to one whom by a similarity of appearances he had mistaken for a friend on whom he had formerly conferred obligations which he seemed then to have forgotten  Antonio  and  Viola  Will you deny me now  Is't possible that my deserts to you  Can lack persuasion  Do not tempt my misery  Lest that it make me so unsound a man  As to upbraid you with th  se kindnesses  That I have done for you  To which the innocent and mistaken Viola replies with a becoming spirit of conscious virtue  I hate ingratitude more in a man  Than lying vainness babbling drunkenness  Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption  Inhabits our frail blood  There is an antient adage which says that  the sin of ingratitude includes every vice  Ingratum fi dixeris omnia dixeris  It renders us unworthy  of all the goods and enjoyments of life even of our very existence for we owe them all to favour and benevolence Religion and virtue are therefore but barely the acknowledging a debt which must ever remain undischarged  All the moral I have been able to extract from this Piece concludes in this Scene with a position which  it were devoutly to be wished  had as much truth in physics as it has in philosophy That the outward form is but the visible sign of the internal mind  Antonio  Thou hast Sebastian done good feature shame  In Nature there's no blemish but the mind  None can be called deformed but the unkind  Virtue is beauty but the beauteous evil  Are empty trunks o'erflourished by the Devil  I shall here give a quotation from a modern dramatic poem of distinguished merit as the passage relates so immediately to the subject above last mentioned  Beauty and virtue are the same  They differ only in the name  What to the soul is pure and bright  Is beauty in a moral light  And what to sense does charms convey  Is beauty in the natural way  Each from one source its essence draws  And both conform to Nature's laws  SOCRATES  THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR  Dramatis Personae  MEN  SIR JOHN FALSTAFF  MR FORD  FENTON in love with Anne Page  WOMEN  ANNE PAGE in love with FENTON  The Merry Wives of Windsor  THIS is one of the best acting Comedies of Shakespeare and is replete with character humour and incident but supplies very little toward the purpose of this Work However whatever there is has a right to class with the rest so I shall proceed to take it in its course  ACT II  SCENE I  Upon Mrs Page's reading Falstaff's Loveletter to her she makes the following reflection  What unweighed behaviour hath this Flemish drunkard pickt i' th' Devil's name out of my conversation that he dares in this manner essay me Why he hath not been thrice in my company What should I say to him I was then frugal of my mirth"  And in the next Scene on communicating this adventure to Mrs Ford she recurs to the same thought again  Nay I know notIt makes me almost ready to wrangle with mine own honesty I'll entertain myself like one that I am not acquainted withal for sure unless he knew some stain in me that I know not myself he would never have boarded me in this fury  This is a very natural sentiment for a delicate mind to conceive upon meeting with an affront of this sort and 'tis extremely proper upon all such occasions to enter into such a selfexamination by way of inquiring what part of our own conduct or  unweighed behaviour  as she expresses it might have encouraged the offence and upon an impartial scrutiny we shall generally find that 'tis more our indiscretion than our charms which prompts the attack  SCENE IX  To preserve a charity in censure from a consciousness of our own frailties is very properly recommended  here though spoken in a feigned character  Ford  to  Falstaff  I shall discover a thing to you wherein I must very much lay open mine own imperfections b  t good Sir John as you have one eye upon my follies as you hear them unfolded  turn another into the register of your own  that I may pass with a reproof the easier fith you yourself know how easy it is to be an offender  The vice and folly of unlawful love are well exposed by an excellent allusion in the same Scene  Falstaff  Of what quality was your love then  Ford  Like a fair house  built upon another man's ground  so that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where I have erected it  ACT III  SCENE XII  Where Fenton tells Anne Page her father's objections to him for his soninlaw he gives a just description and character of those spendthrift men of quality who go into the City to look for wives to repair their broken fortunes  He doth object I am too great of birth  And that my state being galled with my expence  I seek to heal it only by his wealth  Besides these other bars he lays before me  My riots past my wild societies  And tells me 'tis a thing impossible  I should love thee but as a property  SCENE XIII  Anne Page lamenting her father's tyranny in condemning her to marry a man she detested on account of his fortune says  O what a world of vile illfavoured faults  Look handsome in  a thousand  I have made this alteration to correspond with the different rates of the times  pounds a year  ACT V  SCENE IV  There was something very pleasing and advantageous to morals in the antient superstition which  supposed the actions of men to have been under the immediate cognizance of certain superior Beings who used to distribute rewards and punishments on the instant  Evans personating the King of the Fairies  Cricket to Windsor's chimneys shalt thou leap  Where fires thou find'st unraked and hearths unswept  There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry  Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery  Go you and where you find a maid  That ere she sleep hath thrice her prayers said  Rein up the organs of her fantasy  Sleep she as sound as careless infancy  But those that sleep and think not on their sins  Pinch them arms legs backs shoulders sides and shins  The metaphorical exposition of this fable is I believe and kindly hope too most fully experienced by the difference of slumbers between an approving and an upbraiding mind An evil conscience is a  shrew  and gives most shocking  curtain lectures    SCENE V  There is a very good reflection made here upon the nature of fear or guilt being apt to confound our reason and senses so as to lead us to mistake appearances for realities  Falstaff upon the mockery of the Fairies being discovered to him says  And these are not Fairies I was three or four times in the thought they were not Fairies and yet  the guiltiness of my mind with the sudden surprise of my powers drove the grossness of the foppery into a received belief in despite of the teeth of all rhime and reason that they were Fairies See now how wit may be made a Jacka  t when 'tis upon ill employment  THE TAMING OF THE SHREW  Dramatis Personae  MEN  VINCENTIO Father of Lucentio  LUCENTIO in love with Bianca  PETRUCHIO a suitor to Catharine

business of this Play declared by the title of it is I fear a work rather of  discipline  than of  precept  we are to expect but few helps from it toward the enrichment of this collection There are as many receipts for effecting this purpose as there are prescriptions for a toothach and for the same reason because none of them answer the end but the getting rid of it for the old proverb still stands bluff against all such documents that  Every man can cure a scold but he who has her    THE INTRODUCTION SCENE III  Among the preparations which are making in order to deceive the drunken Tinker into the notion of his having been a mad Lord just recovering his senses some Strollers are introduced to perform a Play for his entertainment and the Actors meaning to exhibit one of the old religious Farces stiled the  Mysteries  upon enumerating the  properties  necessary toward the representation ask for  a little  vinegar  to make their Devil roar  Upon which passage Dr Warburton gives the following note  When the acting the  Mysteries  of the Old and New Testament was in vogue at the representation of the  Mystery  of the  Passion  Judas and the Devil made a part And the Devil wherever he came was always to suffer some disgrace to make the people laugh as here the buffoonery was to apply the  gall and vinegar  to make him roar And the  Passion  being that of all the  Mysteries  which was most frequently represented  vinegar  became at length the standing implement to torment the  Devil and used for this purpose even after the  Mysteries  ceased and the  Moralities  Certain allegorical pieces where the Virtues and Vices were personified which succeeded to the stage upon the prohibition of the former  came in vogue where the Devil still continued to bear a considerable part The mention of it here was designed to ridicule so absurd a circumstance in these old Farces  The giving such theatrical representations of Sacred Writ was rather something more than barely  absurd  it was extremely profane but the device of tormenting the Devil with  gall and vinegar  had a mystic conceit in it being certainly intended by the authors of these exhibitions as an allusion to a circumstance in the  Passion  mentioned by St Matthew where he says  they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall  Chap xxvii ver And as the sufferings on the  Cross  were undergone for our  redemption from sin  the priests who were the contrivers of this strange and improper species of drama might have intended this particular to shew the distress of the Devil upon that occasion

I study  Virtue and that part of philosophy  Will I apply that treats of happiness  By virtue specially to be achieved  Tell me thy mind for I have Pisa left  And am to Padua come as he that leaves  A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep  And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst  The following reply adds a more liberal scope to the uses of study and travel  Tranio  Me pardonato  gentle master mine  I am in all affected as yourself  Glad that you thus continue your resolve  To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy  Only good master while we do admire  This virtue and this moral discipline  Let's be no  Stoics  nor no  stoeks  I pray  Or so devote to Aristotle's checks  As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured  Talk logic with acquaintance that you have  And practise rhetoric in your common talk  Music and poetry use to quicken you  The mathematics and the metaphysics  Fall to them as you find your stomach serves  No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en  In brief Sir study what you most affect  SCENE III  A truth is here spoken which is too frequently evinced by the general practice of the selfinterested or more properly speaking  avaricious  world where Gremio and Hortensio are conferring together about providing a husband for Catharine as the younger sister is not to be married till the elder is disposed of  Gremio  Think'st thou Hortensio though her father be very rich any man is so very a fool to be married to hell  Hortensio  Tush Gremio though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarms why man there be good fellows  in the world an a man could light on them  would take her with all her faults and money enough    SCENE IV  Love conceived at first sight is the subject of most Romances and the philosophy of these Northern climes looks for it only there but if we consult the volume of Nature more at large we shall find that such extempore passions are not infrequent in the more Southern regions of the world and the clear and warm air of Italy communicates a brisker motion to the heart and spirits than our natural phlegm can possibly be sensible of  Tranio upon perceiving the emotion of Lucentio on his first view of Bianca says to him  I pray you Sir tell me is it possible  That love should on a sudden take such hold  Lucentio  O Tranio till I found it to be true  I never thought it possible or likely  But see while idly I stood looking on  I found the effect of  love in idleness    And now in plainness do confess to thee  That art to me as secret and as dear  As  An  a  to the queen of  Carthage  was  Tranio  I burn I pine I perish  Tranio    If I achieve not this young modest girl  Counsel me  Tranio  for I know thou canst  Assist me  Tranio  for I know thou wilt  Tranio replies very judiciously  Master it is no time to chide you now  Affection is not  rated  Rated  to be chid or counselled away  from the heart  If love hath  toiled  Toiled ensnared  instead of  touched    Warburton  you nought remains but so  Redime te captum quàm queas minimô  Get out of the  as well as you can  Terence    ACT II SCENE II  Mildness opposed to violence with regard to their different effects upon the passions and affections of the mind is justly illustrated here by the following simile  Petruchio  Though little fire grows great with little wind  Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all  ACT IV SCENE VIII  Among the various methods that Petruchio makes use of after his marriage with Catharine to tame her spirit the following passage presents us with one which the satirists of our sex will be apt to say was a severe test of female temper  Catharine Petruchio Milliner  and  Mantuamaker  Milliner  Here is the cap your worship did bespeak  Petruchio  Why this was moulded on a porringer  A velvet dish fy fy 'tis lewd and filthy  Why 'tis a cockle or a walnutshell  A knack a toy a trick a baby's cap  Away with it come let me have a bigger  Catharine  I'll have no bigger this doth fit the time  Is fashionable    And  gentlewomen  wear such caps as these  Petruchio  When you are  gentle  you shall have one too  And not till then  Catharine  Why Sir I trust I may have leave to speak  And speak I will I am no child no babe  Your betters have endured me say my mind  And if you cannot best you stop your ears  My tongue will tell the anger of my heart  Or else my heart concealing it will break  And rather than it shall I will be free  Even to the utmost as I please in words  Petruchio  Why thou say'st true it is a paltry cap  A custard coffin a bauble a silken pie  I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not  Catharine  Love me or love me not I like the cap  And I will have it or I will have none  Petruchio  The gownwhy ayCome taylor let us see't  O mercy Heaven what masking stuff is here  What this a sleeve 'tis like a demicannon  What ups and downs carved like an appletart  Here's snip and snip and slish and slash  Like to a censer in a barber's shop  Why what a devil's name taylor call'st thou this  Mantuamaker  You bid me make it orderly and well  According to the fashion of the time  Catharine  I never saw a better fashioned gown  More quaint more pleasing nor more commendable  Belike you mean to make a puppet of me  Upon this passage Doctor Warburton has passed the following stricture  Shakespeare has here copied Nature with great skill Petruchio by frightening starving and overwatching his wife had tamed her into gentleness and submission and the audience expects to hear no more of the shrew when on her being crossed in the article of fashion and finery the most inveterate folly of the sex she flies out again though for the last time into all the intemperate rage of her character  This is being severe on our sex at a very cheap rate indeed foibles passions and inconsiderable attachments are equally common to all mankind without distinction of gender and the difference of objects gives no sort of advantage to men over us as all eager pursuits except those of virtue are alike ridiculous and unimportant in the candid and impartial estimation of reason and philosophy  "Another Florio doating on a flower"  YOUNG  Petruchio having gained a conquest in this material point proceeds to dress her and himself in poor attire and proposes that they should go pay a visit to her family in such mean garments upon which occasion he expresses a sentiment so just in itself that it betrays a sad corruption in the morals of mankind that experience cannot support it  Petruchio  Well come my Kate we will unto your father's  Even in these honest mean habiliments  Our purses shall be proud our garments poor  For 'tis th  mind that makes the body rich  And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds  So honour peereth in the meanest habit  What is the jay more precious than the lark▪  Because his feathers are more beautiful  Or is the adder better than the eel  Because his painted skin contents the eye  Oh no good Kate neither art thou the worse  For this poor furniture and mean array  ACT V SCENE V  After Catharine has been thoroughly reclaimed she takes an occasion from a circumstance in the Play of reproving another married woman in an admirable speech wherein the description of a wayward wife with the duty and submission which ought to be shewn to a husband are finely set forth  Fy fy unknit that threatening unkind brow  And dart not scornful glances from those eyes  To wound thy lord thy king thy governor  It blots thy beauty as frosts bite the meads  Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds  And in no sense is meet or amiable  A woman moved is like a fountain troubled  Muddy illseeming thick bereft of beauty  And while it is so none so dry or thirsty  Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it  Thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper  Thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee  And for thy maintenance commits his body  To painful labour both by sea and land  To watch the night in storms the day in cold  While thou lyest warm at home secure and safe  And craves no other tribute at thy hands  But love fair looks and true obedience  Too little payment for so great a debt  Such duty as the subject owes the prince  Even such a woman oweth to her husband  And when she's froward peevish sullen sour  And not obedient to his honest will  What is she but a foul contending rebel  And graceless traitor to her loving lord  I am ashamed that women are so simple  To offer war where they should kneel for peace  Or seek for rule supremacy and sway  When they are bound to serve love and obey  Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth  Unapt to toil and trouble in the world  But that our soft conditions and our hearts  Should well agree with our external parts  Come come you froward and unable worms  My mind has been as big as one of yours  My heart as great my reason haply more  To bandy word for word and frown for frown  But now I see our lances are but straws  Our strength as weak our weakness past compare  That seeming to be most which we indeed least are  I have stopped short here as thinking that the following lines might have marred the whole beauty of the speech the doctrine of  passive obedience and nonresistance  in the state of marriage being there carried perhaps rather a little too far But I shall quote them here as they afford me an opportunity of remarking on the nature of too prompt reformees who are apt to run into the very contrary extreme at once betraying more of the  timeserver  than the  convert    But in general indeed it has been observed that the most haughty tyrants become on a reverse of fortune the most abject slaves and this from a like principle in both cases that they are apt to impute the same spirit of despotism to the conqueror they were before imprest with themselves and consequently are brought to tremble at the apprehension of their own vice  The lines I allude to are these  Then vail your stomachs for it is no boot  And place your hands beneath your husband's foot  In token of which duty if he please  My hand is ready may it do him ease  To vail  is to submit to be awed by authority  THE COMEDY OF ERRORS  Dramatis Personae  MEN  ANTIPHOLIS  BALTHAZAR  WOMEN  An Abbess  ADRIANA wife to Antipholis  LUCIANA her Sister  THE COMEDY of ERRORS  ACT II SCENE I  THE first passage that I find worthy of being noted in this Play happens to be a repetition of the same moral which concluded my remarks on the last piece but as this hint cannot be too often repeated I shall supply the quotation though it may be needless to make any further observations upon the subject  Adriana  and  Luciana  Adriana  Neither my husband nor the slave returned  That in such haste I sent to seek his master  Sure Luciana it is two o'clock  Luciana  Perhaps some merchant hath invited him  And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner  Good sister let us dine and never fret  A man is master of his liberty  Time is their master and when they see time  They'll go or come If so be patient sister  Adriana  Why should their liberty than ours be more  Luciana  Because their business still lies out adoor  Adriana  Look when I serve him so he takes it ill  Luciana  O know he is the bridle of your will  Adriana  There's none but asses will be bridled so  Luciana  Why  headstrong liberty is lashed with woe  There's nothing situate under heaven's eye  But hath its bound on earth in sea or sky  The beasts the fishes and the winged fowls  Are their male's subjects and at their controuls  Man more divine the master of all these  Lord of the wide world and wide watery seas  Indued with intellectual sense and soul  Of more preeminence than fish or fowl  Are masters to their females and their lords  Then let your will attend on their accords  Adriana  This servitude makes you to keep unwed  Luciana  Not this but troubles of the marriagebed  Adriana  But were you wedded you would bear some sway  Luciana  Ere I learn love I'll practise to obey  In the continuation of the same dialogue where Luciana preaches patience to her sister Adriana points out to her very naturally the great difference between giving and taking of advice  Adriana  Patience unmovedNo marvel tho' she pause  Pause  acquiesces or submits  Johnson    They can be meek who have no other cause  A wretched soul bruised with adversity  We bid be quiet when we hear it cry  But were we burdened with like weight of pain  As much or more we should ourselves complain  So thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee  With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me  But if thou live to see like right bereft  This  foo  begged  Al  ding to the Law term  of begging the guardianship  of an Idiot  Ditto    patience in thee will be left  ACT III SCENE I  In a passage here there is a sentiment of great propriety and delicacy argued upon in the dissuading a person from the commission of an unseemly action even though the thing itself might be sufficiently justified in one's own breast A respect to decency and the opinion of the world is an excellent bulwark to our virtues  When Antipholis upon being denied admittance into his house from a mistake in his wife and domestics is in resentment preparing to force open the door his friend intreats his forbearance in the following words  Balthazar  Be ruled by me depart in patience  And let us to the Tyger  A Tavern so called from the sign  all to dinner  And about evening  me yourself alone  To know the reason of this strange restraint  If by strong hand you offer to break in  Now in the stirring passage of the day  A vulgar comment will be made of it  And that supposed by the common rout  That is the world will be apt to frame suppositions c    Against your yet ungalled estimation  That may with foul intrusion enter in  And dwell upon your grave when you are dead  For slander lives upon succession  For ever housed where once it gets possession  Prior speaks very refinedly on the same nice subject  Beyond the fixed and settled rules  Of vice and virtue in the schools  Above the letter of the law  Which holds our men and maids in awe  The better sort should set before 'em  A grace a manner a decorum  Something that gives their acts a light  Makes them not only just but bright  And sets them in that open fame  Which witty malice cannot blame  ACT V SCENE II  There are some excellent documents for wives laid down in this place upon the following occasion  Antipholis in this  Comedy of Errors  being supposed to be out of his senses takes sanctuary in a Priory to screen himself from Adriana and her friends who attempt to seize him and the Abbess coming forth to forbid their entrance first artfully draws a confession from Adriana of her manners and conduct toward her husband upon her having conceived some jealousy of him and then proceeds to infer the cause of his distraction from her behaviour  Abbess  Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck at sea  Buried some dear friend Hath not else his eye  Strayed his affection in unlawful love  A sin prevailing much in youthful men  Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing  Which of these sorrows is he subject to  Adriana  To none of these except it be the last  Namely some love that drew him oft from home  Abbess  You should for that have reprehended him  Adriana  Why so I did  Abbess  Ay but not rough enough  Adriana  As roughly as my modesty would let me  Abbess  Haply in private  Adriana  And in assemblies too  Abbess  Ay but not enough  Adriana  It was the copy of our conference  In bed he slept not for my urging it  At board he fed not for my urging it  Alone it was the subject of my theme  In company I often glanced at it  Still did I tell him it was vile and bad  Abbess  And therefore came it that the man was mad  The venom clamours of a jealous woman  Poison more deadly than a mad dog's tooth  It seems his sleeps were hindered by thy railing  And therefore comes it that his head is light  Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings  Unquiet meals make ill digestions  Therefore the raging fire of fever bred  And what's a fever but a fit of madness  Thou say'st his sports were hindered by thy brawls  Sweet recreation barred what doth ensue  But moody and dull melancholy  Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair  And at its heels a huge infectious troop  Of pale distemperatures and foes to life  In food in sport and life preserving rest  To be disturbed would mad or man or beast▪  The consequence is then thy jealous fits  Have scared thy husband from the use of 's wits  MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING  Dramatis Personae  MEN  LEONATO Governor of Messina  ANTONIO his brother  DON PEDRO Prince of Arragon  CLAUDIO his friend  DON JOHN bastard brother to Don Pedro  CONRADE his friend  BENEDICK a young lord a marriagehater  A FRIAR  A MESSENGER  WOMEN  HERO daughter to Leonato  BEATRICE niece to Leonato  Much Ado About Nothing  ACT I SCENE I  Leonato  and  Messenger  A Messenger from the camp telling Leonato of his having given an account of the gallant behaviour of Claudio to his uncle says  I have already delivered him letters and there appears much joy in himeven so much that joy could not shew itself  modest  enough without a badge of  bitterness    Upon this passage Doctor Warburton has given a note so full and ingenious that it would be presumption in me to offer my comment on it in any other sense or words than his own  This is judiciously expressedOf all the transports of joy that which is attended with tears is the least offensive because carrying with it this mark of pain it allays the envy that usually attends another's happiness This he finely calls a  modest  joy such a one as did not insult the observer by an indication of happiness unmixed with pain  ACT II  SCENE I  Physiognomists say that the features of the mind usually mark their impressions on the countenance A mirthful or melancholy aspect a wanton or malicious one in fine every characteristic trait of visage throughout denote their correspondent passions or affections in the soul Socrates acknowledged the certainty of this science by confessing a description of himself to be true as to his nature though false regarding his character  According to this piece of philosophy a person of a severe and saturnine complexion is humorously described in this place  Beatrice  How tartly that gentleman looks I never can see him but I am heartburned an hour after  From hence this lively girl proceeds to draw a contrast between him and another person of a contrary disposition very justly censuring both of the extremes  He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick the one is too like an image and says nothing and the other too much like my lady's eldest son evermore tattling  SCENE III  The absolute dominion which love is found to usurp not only over our passions but our very principles is too justly described in a passage here which may lead one to pronounce that neither man or woman can truly boast a friend whom they have not had an occasion of first trying as a rival  Claudio  Friendship is constant in all other things  Save in the office and affairs of love  Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues  Use their own tongues  for  let use    Let every eye negotiate for itself  And trust no agent Beauty is a witch  Against whose charms faith melteth into blood  This is an accident  Accident  for  article  of hourly proof  SCENE V  The effect of strong passion in the prevention of utterance is well expressed here  Claudio  Silence is the perfectest herald of joy  I were but little happy if I could say how much    SCENE VIII  The total metamorphosis of character manners and disposition wrought in us by love is well described in a speech in this Scene  Benedick  I do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviour to love will after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by falling himself in love And such a man is Claudio I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor  and the pipe I have known when he would have walked ten miles a foot to see a good armour and now will he lye ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turned orthographer his words are a very fantastical banquet just so many strange dishes  From these reflections Benedick goes on holding a debate with himself upon this subject and like most people before their hearts have become a party in the matter draws a vain portrait of the peerless paragon who only can be capable of triumphing over his affections leaving nothing in the choice of his mistress to Heaven itself except  the colour of her hair    May I be so converted and see with these eyes I cannot tell I think not I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but I'll take my oath that till he have made one of me he shall never make me such a fool One woman is fair yet I am well another is wise yet I am well another virtuous yet I am well But till all graces meet in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace Rich she shall be that's certain wise or I'll none virtuous or I'll never cheapen her fair or I'll never look on her mild or come not near me noble or not I for an angel of good discourse an excellent musician  and her hair shall be of what colour it please God    SCENE IX  Modesty is as sure an attendant on Merit as its companion as Envy is as  its shade  Envy does merit as its  shade  pursue  And like its  shadow  proves the  substance  too  POPE    Pedro  It is the witness still of excellency  To put a strange face on its own perfection  In the same Scene Don Pedro speaking of Benedick says  The man doth fear God howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make  This is too common a character in life of persons who scoff at religion with as much  fear and trembling  as would be sufficient to  work out their salvation  The whole of infidelity is owing to a foolhardy disposition  of this sort The strongest Deists are but Sceptics and the Atheist no more than a Deist in reality nay often as Pope humorously expresses it on another occasion  "May be  a sad good Christian  in his heart"  SCENE X  The scheme for inducing Benedick and Beatrice to fall in love with each other which is commenced with him in the preceding Scene and concluded with her in the first one of the Third Act is most admirably laid The surest method that artifice can contrive to inspire a passion in any one is by giving them a notion of the other party's predilection for them for as Hero says to Ursula in the plot on Beatrice  Let it be thy part  To praise him more than ever man did merit  My talk to thee must be how Benedick  Is sick in love with Beatrice  Of such matter  Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made  That often wounds by hearsay  Act III Scene I  And again  If it prove so then loving goes by haps  Some Cupids kill with arrows some with traps  Ditto  When every other circumstance of years of rank and fortune happens to be on a par such arts may perhaps be allowed to pass under the title of  pious frauds  at least for gratitude is a good cement of affections as it serves to confirm passion by principle  The readiness with which we are apt to run into the snare ourselves with the kind of logic we use in order to make a  sudden resolve  appear a  deliberate purpose  may be seen displayed in the soliloquy of Benedick just after Don Pedro Claudio and Leonato had played off their part against him as supposing him not to be within hearing  Benedick advancing from the arbour  This can be no trick the conference was  sadly  Sadly  for  gravely  or  seriously  borne They have the truth of this from Hero they seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have the full bent Love me Why it must be requitedI hear how I am censured they say I will bear myself proudly if I perceive the love to come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affectionI did never think to marryI must not seem proudhappy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending They say the lady is fair 'tis a truth I can bear them witnessAnd virtuous'Tis so I cannot reprove itAnd wisebut for loving meBy my troth it is no addition to her witnor no great argument of her folly neither for I will be horribly in love with herI may chance to have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because I have railed so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age Shall quips and sentences these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour No the world must be peopledWhen I said I would die a bachelor I did not think I should live 'till I were married Here comes Beatrice By this day she's a fair ladyI do spy some marks of love in her  The speech of Beatrice also in the first Scene of the Third Act has a right to take place here though somewhat before its time as  a companion  to the preceding  Beatrice advancing after Hero and Ursula had quitted the Scene  What fire is in my ears Can this be true  Stand I condemned for pride and scorn so much  Contempt farewel and maiden pride adieu  No glory lives behind the back of such  And Benedick love on I will requite thee  Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand  If thou dost love thy fondness shall incite thee  To bind our loves up in a holy band  For others say thou dost deserve and I  Believe it better than reportingly  ACT III SCENE I  A most unamiable character of pride and selfconceit is given in this place which falls very properly  within the moral tendency of these notes to expose to view though it is only spoken in consequence of the plot against Beatrice  Hero  But nature never framed a woman's heart  Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice  Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes  Misprizing what they look on and her wit  Values itself so highly that to her  All matter else seems weak she cannot love  Nor take no shape nor project of affection  She is so selfindeared  The same character is continued in the same Scene with the addition of a satirical vein which is extremely well and humorously described  Hero  I never yet saw man  How wise how noble young how rarely featured  But she would spell him backwardIf fairfaced  She'd swear the gentleman should be her sister  If black why Nature drawing of an  antick  A Harlequin    Made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded  If low an  aglet  Agl  ts  were little Images made use of as tags to be suspended at the points of the old fashioned laced cravats somewhat like those the Roman Catholics king at the bottom of their  rosaries    very vilely cut  If speaking why a vane blown with all winds  If silent then a block moved by none  So turns she every man the wrong side out  And never gives to truth and virtue that  Which simpleness and merit purchaseth  Hero in the same Scene pretending to lay a scheme with Ursula for curing Benedick of his supposed passion for Beatrice while she is listening says  No rather I will go to Benedick  And counsel him to fight against his passion  And truly I'll devise some honest slanders  To stain my cousin with  One doth not know  How such an ill word may impoison liking  The success of such a wicked device I have already remarked on in a passage of the  Two Gentlemen of Verona  Act Third and Scene Fifth  "The best way is to slander Valentine c"  and I shall therefore make no further note on the subject here  I have not been so much an oeconomist in other places where the recurring of similar topics afforded me opportunities of saving myself trouble by references but this one is so very irksome a theme that it disgusts me to dwell upon it for a moment for which reason should I happen to meet with it again in the course of this Work I shall pass it by unnoticed for the future  ACT IV  SCENE II  Hero being falsely accused of an act of dishonour is examined before her father her lover and a Friar with other friends who had all met together in a convent to attend her nuptials and the bitterness of a parent's anguish and resentment on so trying an occasion is most feelingly expressed in the following speech  Leonato  to his daughter on her fainting    Do not live Hero do not ope thy eyes  For did I think thou wouldst not quickly die  Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames  Myself would on the rereward of reproaches  Strike at thy life Grieved I I had but one  Chid I for that at frugal Nature's frame  I've one too much by thee Why had I one  Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes  Why had I not with charitable hand  Ta'en up a beggar's issue at my gates  Who smeared thus and mired with infamy  I might have said No part of it is mine  This shame derives itself from unknown loins  But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised  And mine that I was proud of mine so much  That I myself was to myself not mine  Valuing of her why sheO she is fallen  Into a pit of ink that the wide sea  Hath drops too few to wash her clean again  And salt too little which may season give  To her foul tainted flesh  Upon this occasion the good Friar with that charity and humanity which so well become the sacred office of Priesthood and from that observation which his long experience in the business of  auricular confession  had enabled him to form stands forth an advocate for Hero's innocence in the following poetical and philosophical oration  Hear me a little  For I have only silent been so long  And given way into this course of fortune  By noting of the lady I have marked  A thousand blushing apparitions  To start into her face a thousand innocent shame  In angel whiteness bear away those blushes  And in her eye there hath appeared a fire  To burn the errors that these princes  Who were her accusers  hold  Against her maiden truthCall me a fool  Trust not my reading nor my observations  Which with experimental seal do warrant  The tenor of my  book  I do not comprehend the meaning of this expression unless it be allowed to be figurative of his art science or knowledge in phys  ognemy  trust not my age  My reverence calling nor divinity  If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here  Under some biting error  But a little after this good casuist asks her suddenly this trying question  Lady what man is he you are accused of  Upon which passage Doctor Warburton makes the following judicious remark  The Friar had just before boasted his great skill in sifting out the truth and indeed he appears in this instance to have been no fool He was by all the while at the accusation and heard no names mentioned Why then should he ask her what man she was accused of But in this lay the subtilty of his examination For had Hero been guilty it was very probable that in the hurry and confusion of spirits into which the terrible insult of her lover had thrown her she  would never have observed that the man's name was not mentioned and so on this question might have betrayed herself by naming the person she was conscious of an affair with The Friar observed this and so concluded that were she guilty she would probably have fallen into the trap he had laid for her I only take notice of this to shew how admirably well Shakespeare knew how to sustain his characters  But this noble defence for the unhappy Hero not being sufficient to obviate the strong impressions of her guilt which the father had conceived against her the honest Priest then goes on to propose a scheme of conduct to him which might peradventure bring about some crisis or event that would clear her innocence at least silence the infamy and remove her from being any longer an object of obloquy In this proposal there is shewn a just knowledge of the world and an intimate acquaintance with the secret movements of the human heart  Friar  Pause a while  And let my counsel sway you in this case  Your daughter here the princes left for dead  On her fainting    Let her a time be secretly kept in  And publish it that she is so indeed  Maintain a mourning ostentation  And on your family's old monument  Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rite  That appertain unto a burial  Leonato  What shall become of this What will this do  Friar  Marry this well carried shall on her behalf  Change slander to remorse that is some good  But not for that I dream on this strange course  But on this travail look for greater birth  She dying as it must be so maintained  Upon the instant that she was accused  Shall be lamented pitied and excused  Of every hearer for it so falls out  That what we have we prize not to the worth  Whiles we enjoy it but being lacked and lost  Why then we reck the value then we find  The virtue that possession would not shew us  Whilst it was ours so shall it fare with Claudio▪  When he shall hear she died upon his words  The idea of her life shall sweetly creep  Into his study of imagination  And every lovely organ of her life  Shall come apparelled in more precious habit  More moving delicate and full of life  Into the eye and prospect of his soul  Than when she lived indeed Then shall he mourn  If ever love had interest in his liver  And wish he had not so accused her  No though he thought his accusation true  Let this be so and doubt not but success  Will fashion the event in better shape  Than I can lay it down in likelihood  But if all aim but this be levelled false  The supposition of the lady's death  Will quench the wonder of her infamy  And if it sort not well you may conceal her  As best befits her wounded reputation  In some reclusive and religious life  Out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries  To this innocent deception the father at length consents expressing himself at the same time in a manner that every person's experience who has ever had the misfortune to have been in such situations must have felt the justness of  Leonato  Being that I flow in grief  The smallest twine may lead me  Doctor Johnson's note upon this passage is worthy of being quoted here  This is one of our Author's observations upon life Men overpowered with distress eagerly listen to the first offers of relief close with every scheme and believe every promise He that has no longer any confidence in himself is glad to repose his trust in any other that will undertake to guide him  SCENE III  Beatrice in spiriting up Benedick to avenge her cousin Hero's quarrel thus expresses her resentment against the offender  Is he not approved in the height a villain that hath slander'd scorn'd dishonour'd my kinswoman O that I were a man What bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then with public accusation uncover'd slander unmitigated rancour O God that I were a man I would eat his heart in the marketplace O that I were a man for his sake or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake But manhood is melted into courtesies valour into compliment and men are only turned into tongue and trim ones tooHe is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie and swears to itI cannot be a man with wishing therefore I will die a woman with grieving  There is a generous warmth of indignation in this speech which must certainly impress a female reader with the same sentiments upon such an occasion I am not so disingenuous to take advantage of this passage as an historical fact but am willing to rest it upon the sole authority of the Poet's assumption as this will sufficiently answer the design of my introducing it which is to vindicate my sex from the general but unjust charge of being prone to slander for were this the case were not the resentment of Beatrice in this instance natural how could it move our sympathy which it actually does here even though we acknowledge the circumstance to have been merely imaginary  I believe that there is nothing which a woman of virtue feels herself more offended at than defamation or scandal first against her own character and proportionably when others are made the victims There are women indeed who may be fond of flander as having an interest in depreciating an idea of chastity but this is owing to their frailty not their sexVice is neither masculine nor feminine  'tis the common of two    ACT V  SCENE I  While the abovementioned experiment was depending and before the honour of Hero had been cleared Antonio her uncle endeavours to comfort his brother under this misfortune who replies to him in a manner very natural for a person labouring under the immediate pressure of affliction to speak to all advisers who do not suffer the same portion of grief themselves  Leonato  I pray thee cease thy counsel  Which falls into mine ears as profitless  As water in a sieveGive me not counsel  Nor let no comforter delight mine ear  But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine  Bring me a father that so loved his child  Whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine  And bid him speak of patience  Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine  And let it answer every strain for strain  And thus for thus and such a grief for such  In every lineament branch shape and form  If such a one will smile and stroke his beard  Cry Sorrow wag and hem when he should groan  Patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk  With candlewasters bring him yet to me  And I of him will gather patience  But there is no such man for brother men  Can counsel and give comfort to that grief  Which they themselves not feel but tasting it  Their counsel turns to passion which before  Would give preceptial medicine to rage  Fetter strong madness in a silken thread  Charm ach with air and agony with words  No no'tis all men's office to speak patience  To those that wring under the load of sorrow  But no man's virtue or sufficiency  To be so moral when he shall endure  The like himselftherefore give me no counsel  My griefs cry louder than  advertisement  Advertisement  for  adm  nition    Antonio  Therein do men from children nothing differ  Leonato  I prithee peace I will be flesh and blood  For there was never yet philosopher  That could endure the toothach patiently  However they have writ the stile of Gods  And made a pish at chance and sufferance  SCENE II  Upon the two brothers meeting Claudio soon after the father challenges him to single combat for the scandal he had thrown upon his daughter's fame which being passed off in a sort of contemptuous manner the resentment of the younger brother is roused and he immediately steps between and takes the quarrel upon himself retorting the affront by a just description of the bragging profligates of those or indeed of any times Horatio's taunt to Lothario  In the Fair Penitent  seems to have been borrowed from this passage  Claudio  to  Leonato  Away I will not have to do with you  Leonato  Canst thou so  daffe  An old English expression for  putting of  or  setting aside    me Thou hast killed my child  If thou kill'st me boy thou shalt kill a man  Antonio  He shall kill two of us and men indeed  But that's no matter let him kill one first  Win me and wear me let him answer me  Come follow me boyCome boy follow me  Sir boy I'll whip you from your foining fence  Nay as I am a gentleman I will  Leonato  Brother  Antonio  Content yourselfGod knows I loved my niece  And she is dead slandered to death by villains  That dare as well answer a man indeed  As I dare take a serpent by the tongue  Boys apes braggarts jacks milksops  Leonato  Brother Anthony  Antonio  Hold you contentWhat man I know them yea  And what they weigh even to the utmost scruple  Scambling outfacing fashionmonging boys  That lye and cog and flout deprave and slander  Go antickly and shew an outward hideousness  And speak off half a dozen dangerous words  How they might hurt their enemiesif they durst  And this is all  As I commenced my remarks on this Play with a note of Doctor Warburton's I shall conclude them also with another very judicious observation of the same critic upon this last passage  This brother Anthony is the truest picture imaginable of human nature He had assumed the character of a Sage to comfort his brother o'erwhelmed with grief for his only daughter's affront and dishonour and had severely reproved him for not commanding his passion better on so trying an occasion Yet immediately after this no sooner does he begin to suspect that his age and valour are slighted but he falls into the most intemperate fit of rage himself and all his brother can say or do is not of power to pacify him This is copying Nature with a penetration and exactness of judgment peculiar to Shakespeare As to the expression too of his passion nothing can be more highly painted  ALL's WELL THAT ENDS WELL  Dramatis Personae  MEN  KING of France  BERTRAM Count of Rousillon  LAFEU an old Lord  PAROLLES a Parasite and Coward attendant on Bertram  A Lord  A Steward  WOMEN  COUNTESS of Rousillon Mother to Bertram  HELENA her Ward Daughter to a famous Physician long since dead  All's Well That Ends Well  ACT I  SCENE I  THE Countess of Rousillon speaking of Helena her Ward says  I have those hopes of her good that her education promises her disposition she inherits which makes fair gifts fairer for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities there commendations go with pity they are virtues and traitors too in her they are the better for her simpleness she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness  The Commentators are not agreed in opinion upon the  verbal  sense of this passagebut no matter I shall leave their criticism undecided and proceed to the moral interpretation of it which is that a  derived  virtue which implies a natural good disposition affords considerable assistance to a good education that accomplishments without such a foundation are a disadvantage to the possessors as but tending to their condemnation and reproach that the innocence and simplicity of Helena's mind and heart made use of no arts but left her talents to the natural effect of their own operations and that though a good disposition may be  inherited  virtues must be  purchased    In the same Scene when Bertram comes to take leave of his mother in order to attend the king she gives him her blessing in a most pathetic manner and the most effectual too where the seeds of virtue are by setting his noble father before him as a pattern To this she likewise adds some precepts for the conduct of his life which would have done honour to the first Sages of Aegypt Greece or Rome  Countess  Be thou blest Bertram and succeed thy father  In manners as in shape Thy blood and virtue  Contend for empire in thee and thy goodness  Share with thy birthright Love all trust a few  Do wrong to none be able for thine enemy  Rather in power than use and keep thy friend  Under thy own life's key be checked for silence  But never taxed for speech What Heaven more will  That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down  Fall on thy head Farewel my son  SCENE II  Frequent descriptions of love recur in almost every one of Shakespeare's Plays The enamoured Helena speaks very affectingly on this subject here first by reproving the vain ambition of her passion for Bertram a young nobleman so far above her hopes and then proceeding notwithstanding though very naturally to give an account of the fond indulgencies with which she still nourishes her flame  Helena  My imagination  Carries no favour in it but my Bertram's  I am undone There is no living none  If Bertram be awayIt were all one  That I should love a bright particular star  And think to wed it he is so above me  In his bright radiance and collateral light  Must I be comforted not in his sphere  The ambition in my love thus plagues itself  The hind that would be mated by the lion  Must die for love'T was pretty tho' a plague  To see him every hour to sit and draw  His arched brows his hawking eye his curls  In our heart's tablet heart too capable  Of every line and trick of his sweet favour  But now he's gone and my idolatrous fancy  Must sanctify his relicks  The preferences which worthless people flatterers and parasites too often gain by address and compliances before persons of unsupple merit and virtue are well set forth in this place  Helena speaking of Parolles says  I know him a notorious lyar  Think him a great way fool wholly a coward  Yet these fixed evils sit so sit in him  That they take place when Virtue's steely bones  Look bleak in the cold wind full oft we see  Cold  wisdom waiting on  superfluous  folly  Cold for  naked  and superfluous for  wellcloathed    Warburton    SCENE IV  There are some excellent wellspirited reflections here thrown out to encourage men in the exertion of all their active faculties towards the advancement of their fortunes and to earn their independance by the manly means of industry instead of poorly crouching at the gates of Providence whining for an alms  Helena upon her resolving to undertake the cure of the king's disorder in hopes through that means to raise her rank and fortune to a respect not unworthy of Bertram says  Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie  Which we ascribe to heaven The fated sky  Gives us free scope only doth backward pull  Our flow designs when we ourselves are dull  What power is it which mounts my love so high  That makes me see and cannot  feed mine eye  Feed mine eye  that is  with hope    Through mightiest space in fortune nature brings  Likes to join likes and kiss like native things  Impossible be strange attempts to those  That weigh their pain in sense  Who judge from the common appearances of things    and do suppose  What ha'n't been cannot beWho ever strove  To shew her merit that did miss her love  The king's disease My project may deceive me  But my intents are fixed and will not leave me  SCENE V  There is a most beautiful character given here of a gallant soldier and virtuous courtier in the description of Bertram's deceased father with some just strictures on the deficiency of these qualities in the succeeding generation which being the principal parts of the speech I have first noted in it but as there is also a charming mixture of the old  man and the  old  friend in the rest of it I shall here give the whole together  King  to  Bertram  I would I had that corporal soundness now  As when thy father and myself in friendship  First tried our soldiership he did look far  Into the service of the time and was  Discipled of the bravest He lasted long  But on us both did haggish age steal on  And wore us out of actIt much repairs me  To talk of your good father in his youth  He had the wit which I can well observe  Today in our young lords but they may jest  Till their own scorn return to them unnoted  Ere they can bide their levity in honour  Doctor Johnson has given the following note upon this line "This is an excellent observation Jocose follies and slight offences are "only allowed by mankind in him that overpowers them by great qualities"    So like a courtier contempt nor bitterness  Were in his pride or sharpness if they were  His equal had awaked them and his honour  Clock to itself knew the true minute when  Exceptions bid him speak and at that time  His tongue obeyed the hand Who were below him  He used as creatures of another place  And bowed his eminent top to their low ranks  Making them proud of his humility  In their poor praise he humbled Such a man  Might be a copy to these younger times  Which followed well would now demonstrate them  But goers backward  Would were with him he would always say  Methinks I hear him nowHis plausive words  He scattered not in ears but grafted them  To grow there and to bearLet me not live  Thus his good melancholy oft began  On the catastrophe and heel of pastime  When it was outLet me not live quoth he  After my flame lacks oil to be the snuff  Of younger spirits whose apprehensive senses  All but new things disdain whose judgments are  Mere fathers of their garments whose constancies  Expire before their fashionsThis he wished  I after him do after him wish too  Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home  I quickly were dissolved from my hive  To give some labourers room  The selfinterruptions in the above speech how admirably are they in the usual stile of a narrative old man What age what sex what character station or office of life escapes the touches of Shakespeare's plastic hand  SCENE VI  The diffidence which every one should manifest respecting their own merits is well recommended in the following passage  The steward speaking to the Countess  Madam the care I have had to even  To  even  to keep pace with  your content I wish might be rather found in the calendar of my past endeavours  for then we wound our modesty and make foul the cleanness of our deservings when of ourselves we publish them    ACT II  SCENE VI  There are a number of moral and philosophic thoughts on worth and virtue and on the severe laws which the pride and vanity of mankind have established against their own happiness and enjoyments  Quam temerè in nosmet legem sancimus iniquam  HOR  delivered here on the occasion of Bertram's declining a marriage with Helena who had confessed her love for him to the king because the happened to have neither birth or means to intitle her to the honour of his alliance  King  Strange is it that our bloods  Whose colour weight and heat poured out together  Would quite confound distinction yet stand off  In differences so mighty If she be  All that is virtuous save what thou dislikest  A poor physician's daughter thou dislikest  Of virtue for a name But do not so  From lowest place when virtuous things proceed  The place is dignified by the doer's deed  Where great addition swells and virtue none  It is a dropsied honourVirtue alone  Is good without a name Helen is so  The property by what it is should go  Not by the titleShe is young wise fair  In these to Nature she's immediate heir  And these breed honour That is honour's scorn  Which challenges itself as honours born  And is not like the sire Honours best thrive  When rather from our acts we them derive  Than our foregoers The mere word's a slave  Debaucht on every tomb on every grave  A lying trophy and as oft is dumb  Where dust and  damned  Repr  ful  to the living who neglect monumental inscriptions to the meritorious dead I am surprized that the Commentators have left this obscure expression without a light  oblivion is the tomb  Of honoured bones indeed  SCENE VII  When Lafeu has quitted the scene after having bullied and abused Parolles the latter being left alone makes this soliloquy  Parolles  Well thou hast a son that shall take this disgrace of me scurvy old filthy lord WellI must be patient there is no fettering of authority I'll beat him by my life if I can meet him with any convenience an he were double and double a lord I'll have no more pity of his age than I would have ofI'll beat him an if I could but meet him again  Upon this passage Doctor Warburton takes occasion to pay the following just compliment to our Author  This the Poet makes Parolles to speak alone and this is nature A coward would endeavour to hide his poltroonery even from himself An ordinary writer would have been glad of such an opportunity to bring him to a confession  ACT III SCENE IV  When Bertram whom the king had compelled to espouse Helena flies from France to avoid any farther connection with her and had engaged in the Tuscan war her mourning and reflections upon that occasion are extremely moving and tender particularly in her manner of accusing herself with having been the cause of all his perils  Helena  Poor lord is't I  That chase thee from thy country and expose  Those tender limbs of thine to the event  Of the nonesparing war And is it I  That drive thee from the sportive court where thou  Wast shot at with fair eyes to be the mark  Of smoky muskets O ye leaden messengers  That ride upon the violent speed of fire  Fly with false aim pierce the stillmoving air  That sings with piercingDo not touch my lord  Whoever shoots at him I set him there  Whoever charges on his forward breast  I am the caitiff that do hold him to it  And though I kill him not I am the cause  His death was so effected  Better it were  I met the ravening lion when he roared  With sharp constraint of hunger better it were  That all the miseries which Nature owes  Were mine at once No Come thou home Rousillon  Whence honour but of danger wins a scar  As oft it loses all I will be gone  My being here it is that holds thee hence  Shall I stay here to do it No no although  The air of paradise did fan the house  And angels officed allI will be gone  That pitiful rumour may report my flight  To consolate thine ear  ACT IV SCENE III  I shall conclude these observations with a reflection made in this place on the mixed character of human nature in general in which virtue and vice are often so balanced or blended as to prevent perfection on one hand and total depravation on the other  A Lord  The web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and ill together Our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not and our crimes would despair if they were not cherished by our virtues  POSTSCRIPT  I have here finished my notes upon all the Comedies of Shakespeare and hope that the indulgent Reader will be so kind as to dismiss me in this part of my work with a favourable application of the last title or  All's well that ends well    Perhaps I may not be allowed the distinction of  Comedies  as referred to the fourteen foregoing Plays as the shipwreck in the Tempest Antigonus being devoured by a bear and the Prince dying of grief in the Winter's Tale c are not very comic circumstances but this is the division that is generally made of our author's drama though strictly speaking his Plays cannot properly be stiled either Tragedies or Comedies but are in truth a more natural species of composition than either  KING JOHN  Dramatis Personae  MEN  KING JOHN  PHILIP King of France  ARTHUR Nephew to King John  LEWIS the Dauphin  CARDINAL PANDULPHO the Pope's Legate  SALISBURY an English Lord  FAULCONBRIDGE bastard son to Richard the First  HUBERT lieutenant of the Tower  WOMEN  CONSTANCE Mother to Arthur  KING JOHN  ACT II  SCENE VI  THE following speech though delivered with an air of levity and expressed in humorous words and images supplies occasion for three very just reflections The first That  self interest  in the mere worldly sense of the term is the ruling principle of mankind Secondly That men are too apt to inveigh against corruption more from the being void of temptation themselves than their being free from this vice and lastly That bad examples in the superior ranks of life have a dangerous tendency to injure the morals of the inferior classes of a people  Upon a peace being made between the kings of England and France in which the right of Arthur to the British throne is betrayed on the one hand and but poorly compensated on the other Faulconbridge makes this soliloquy  FIRST PART  Mad world mad kings mad composition  John to stop Arthur's title in the whole  Hath willingly departed with a part  And France whose armour conscience buckled on  Whom zeal and charity brought to the field  As God's own soldier  To support Arthur's claim  rounded in the ear  With that same  purposechanger  that fly devil  That broker that still breaks the pate of faith  That daily breakvow he that wins of all  Of kings of beggars old men young men maids  Who having no external thing to lose  But the word  maid  cheats the poor girl of that  That smoothfaced gentleman tickling commodity  Commodity the bias of the world  The world which of itself is poized well  Made to run even upon even ground  Till this advantage this vile drawing bias  This sway of motion this commodity  Makes it take head from all indifferency  From all direction purpose course intent  And this same bias this commodity  This bawd this broker this allchanging word  Clapped on the outward eye of fickle France  Hath drawn him from his own determined aid  From a resolved and honourable war  To a most base and vileconcluded peace  SECOND PART  Yet why rail I on this commodity  But for because he hath not wooed me yet  Not that I have the power to clutch my hand  When his fair angels would salute my palm  But that my hand as unattempted yet  Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich  Well while I am a beggar I will rail  And say there is no sin but to be rich  And being rich my virtue then shall be  To say there is no vice but beggary  THIRD PART  Since kings break faith upon commodity  Gain be my lord for I will worship thee  The astonishment of Constance on hearing that her son's interests are sacrificed to the league with the doubts which we are naturally inclined to conceive of the truth of sudden ill news and the weak state of mind and spirits to which persons in misfortune especially helpless women are generally reduced are all finely painted and described in the following speech  Constance Arthur  and  Salisbury  Constance  to  Salisbury  Gone to be married  One of the articles of the compact was an alliance between a niece of John's and the Dauphin the inheritances which of right belonged to Arthur being the dowry  Gone to swear a peace  False blood to false blood joined Gone to be friends  Shall Lewis have Blanch and Blanch those provinces  It is not so thou hast misspoke misheard  Be well advised tell o'er thy tale again  It cannot bethou dost but say 'tis so  I trust I may not trust theefor thy word  Is but the vain breath of a common man  Believe me I do not believe thee man  I have a king's oath to the contrary  Thou shalt be punished for thus frighting me  For I am sick and capable of fears  Oppressed with wrongs and therefore full of fears  A widow husbandless subject to fears  A woman naturally born to fears  And tho' thou now confess thou didst but jest  With my vexed spirits I cannot make a truce  But they will quake and tremble all this day  What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head  Why dost thou look so sadly on my son  What means that hand upon that breast of thine  Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum  Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds  Be these sad sighs confirmers of thy words  Then speak again not all thy former tale  But this one word whether thy tale be true  A little further upon Salisbury's confirming the bad news she conceives a very natural though unreasonable idea with which however we are apt to be impressed toward all messengers of bad tidings however innocent of the evil  Fellow be gone I cannot brook thy sight  This news hath made thee a most ugly man  That partiality in favour of beauty which it is natural for all persons to be sensible of even where their duty and interests in different objects are equal is strongly marked by Constance when her son begs her to sustain his wrongs with patience The whole speech is affecting  Constance  If thou that bid'st me be content were grim  Ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb  Full of unpleasing blots and  sightle  s  For  unsightly  Shakespeare often places the negative at the end of the adjective instead of the beginning This varies his phrases and enriches his language Modern writers are too much  dictionarybound    stains  Lame foolish crooked swart  prodigious  For  portentous  monstrous births being reckoned ominous formerly    Patched with foul moles and eyeoffending marks  I would not care I then could be content  For then I should not love thee no nor thou  Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown  But thou art fair and at thy birth dear boy  Nature and Fortune joined to make thee great  Of Nature's gifts thou may'st with lilies boast  And with the halfblown rose  In the same Scene when Salisbury tells her that the two kings had sent for her and that  be must not return without her  the answer she makes is full of that dignity which grief mixed with resentment is capable of conferring on illustrious unfortunates and her whole demeanour upon that occasion is expressive of a great soul rendered still braver by misfortunes  Constance  Thou may'st thou shalt  I will not go with thee  I will instruct my sorrows to be proud  For grief is proud and makes his owner stout  To me and to the state of my great grief  Let kings assemble for my grief's so great  That no supporter but the huge firm earth  Can hold it up Here I and sorrow fit  Here is my throne bid kings come bow to it  Sits down on the floor  Doctor Johnson has given us a very judicious note on this passage and as it relates to the passions which as well as morals are a subject of this work I shall present the reader with a transcript of it here  In  Much Ado About Nothing  the father of Hero depressed by her disgrace declares himself so subdued by grief that  a thread may lead him  Being that I  low in grief  The  may lead me  Act IV Scene II  How is it that grief in Leonato and Lady Constance produces effects directly opposite and yet both agreeable to Nature Sorrow softens the mind while it is yet warmed by hope but hardens it when 'tis congealed by despair Distress while there remains any prospect of relief is weak and flexible but when no succour appears is fearless  and stubborn angry alike at those who injure and at those who do not help careless to please where nothing can be gained and fearless to offend when there is nothing further to be dreaded Such was this Author's knowledge of the Passions  SCENE II  What expressions can be stronger in themselves or more shocking to the ears of her oppressors than the following short exclamation  Constance  Arm arm ye Heavens against these perjured kings  A widow cries be husband to me Heaven  Here the speech should have ended the four remaining lines but weaken and disgrace it  SCENE III  When Philip is urged by the Pope's Legate to break the league he had just entered into with John he offers to compound the treachery by  ceasing to be his friend  but  without becoming his enemy    I may disjoin my hand but not my faith  To which Pandulpho makes him this reply  So mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith  And like a civil war set'st oath to oath  Thy tongue against thy tongue O let thy vow  First made to Heaven first be to Heaven performed  That is to be the champion of the Church  What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself  And may not be performed by thyself  For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss  Is't not amiss when it is truly done  And being not done where doing tends to ill  The truth is then most done not doing it  The better act of purposes mistook  Is to mistake again though indirect  Yet indirection thereby grows direct  And falsehood falsehood cures as fire cools fire  Within the scorched veins of one new burned  It is religion that doth make vows kept  But thou hast sworn against religion  By which thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st  And mak'st an oath the surety for thy truth  Against an oath The truth thou art unsure  To swear swear only not to be forsworn  Else what a mockery should it be to swear  But thou dost swear only to be forsworn  And most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear  Therefore thy latter vow's against thy first  Is in thyself rebellion to thyself  And better conquest never canst thou make  Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts  Against these giddy loose suggestions  Upon which better part our prayers come in  If thou vouchsafe them But if not then know  The peril of our curses light on thee  So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off  But in despair die under their black weight  The old Jesuit argues here as ingeniously for the dispensing power of the Papacy as Satan does in Milton for his rebellion The object of both is the same namely  the absolute and exclusive dominion of Heaven    SCENE VI  The wild and enthusiastic manner with which the fondness and despair of Constance for her son impels her to speak of him has something extremely moving in it  Father cardinal I have heard you say  That we shall see and know our friends in Heaven  If that be I shall see my boy again  For since the birth of Cain the first male child  To him that did but yesterday suspire  There was not such a gracious creature born  But now will canker sorrow eat my bud  And chase the native beauty from his cheek  And he will look as hollow as a ghost  As dim and meagre as an aguefit  And so he'll die and rising so again  When I shall meet him in the court of Heaven  I shall not know him therefore never never  Must I behold my  pretty  Arthur more  There is something very tender and affecting in her making use of the epithet  pretty  in the last line It has a better effect there than  dearest angel  or even  lovely  though this last has a more comprehensive sense would have had in that place I must beg leave to refer to the Reader's own taste for  the justness of this observation for I own I cannot explain why it strikes me in this manner myself  The reason why we are apt to cherish grief in our breasts that species of it I only mean which may be distinguished by the name of  tender  sorrow from a peculiar sort of indulgence it is capable of affording us is admirably well expressed in the following passage  Pandulpho  You hold too heinous a respect of grief  Constance  He talks to me who never had a son  Philip  You seem as fond of grief as of your child  Constance  Grief fills the room up of my absent child  Lies in his bed walks up and down with me  Puts on his  pretty  looks repeats his words    Remembers me of all his gracious parts  Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form  Then have I reason to be fond of grief  Fare you well Had you such a loss as I  I could give better comfort than you do  I will not keep this form upon my head  Tearing off her headdress  When there is such disorder in my wits  O Lord my boy my Arthur my fair son  My life my joy my food my all the world  My widow's comfort and my sorrow's cure  These last three lines are almost suffocating I believe no woman with a mother's feeling could ever be able to pronounce them articulately even in representation  Doctor Johnson gives a good note on one of the passages of the above speech  Had you such a loss as I  I could give better comfort than you do  l and  This is a sentiment which great sorrow always dictates Whoever cannot help himself casts his eyes on others for assistance and often mistakes their inability for coldness  I remember a couple of French lines on this subject of grief which contain the same thought that Constance expresses above  Men deuil me plait et doit toujours me plaire  Il me tient lieu de celu  que je pleurs  SCENE VIII  Lewis  Life is as tedious as a twicetold tale  Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man  This may be a just image of life to those who have exhausted its variety and palled their senses with its pleasures The speech might not have ill become his father old Philip then labouring under baffled hopes and disappointed wishes who had just then suffered the mortification of having lost a battle in the heart of his own dominions and whose mistaken faith in heaven had obliged him to break faith on earth without effect too but it was certainly rather too premature a sentence to have proceeded from the lips of a young prince who had been but just married to a woman he loved Such an impropriety in the character of a speaker hurts the effect of a thought or sentiment  In the same Scene there is a strong description given of the situation of a sovereign with regard to the people after he has forfeited their love confidence or esteem  Pandulpho speaking of John's keeping Arthur in prison  This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts  Of all his people and freeze up their zeal  That no so small advantage shall step forth  To check his reign but they will cherish it  No natural exhalation in the sky  No  scape of Nature  See the note before in this Play on the word  prodigious  in the first Scene of this Act  no distempered day  No common wind no customed event  But they will pluck away its natural cause  And call them meteors prodigies and signs  Abortives and presages tongues of Heaven  Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John  And then the hearts  Of all his people shall revolt from him  And kiss the lips of unacquainted change  And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath  Out of the bloody fingers ends of John  ACT IV  SCENE IV  The several useful reflections and morals to be collected from the following speeches are so many and so mixed that it is difficult to separate or distinguish them I shall therefore lay the whole passage together before the Reader to draw his own inferences from and shall also begin the Scene a little earlier than may at first appear to be necessary not only on account of the admirable painting presented to us in the beginning of it but in order to shew the situation of circumstances in which the principal speaker stands at the time  King  John  and  Hubert  Hubert  My lord they say five moons were seen tonight  Four fixed and the fifth did whirl about  The other four in wonderous motion  John  Five moons  Hubert  Old men and beldams in the streets  Do prophecy upon it dangerously  Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths  And when they talk of him they shake their heads  And whisper one another in the ear  And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist  Whilst he that hears makes fearful action  With wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes  I saw a smith stand with his hammer thus  The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool  With open mouth swallowing a taylor's news  Who with his shears and measure in his hand  Standing on slippers which his nimble haste  Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet  Told of a many thousand warlike French  That were embattled and ranked in Kent  Another lean unwashed artificer  Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death  John  Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears  Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death  Thy hand hath murdered him I had a cause  To wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him  Hubert  Had none my lord Why did you not provoke me  Provoke me  for  prompt  or  solicit me    John  It is the curse of kings to be attended  By slaves that take their humours for a warrant  To break into the bloody house of life  And on the winking of authority  To understand a law to know the meaning  Of  dangerous  Difficult  to be dealt with  majesty when perchance it frowns  More upon humour than advised respect  Hubert  Here is your hand and seal for what I did  John  Oh when the last account 'twixt Heaven and earth  Is to be made then shall this hand and seal  Witness against us to damnation  How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds  Makes deeds ill done for hadst not thou been by  A fellow by the hand of Nature marked  Quoted and signed to do a deed of shame  This murder had not come into my mind  But taking note of thy abhorred aspect  Finding thee fit for bloody villainy  Apt liable to be employed in danger  I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death  And thou to be endeared to a king  Madest it no conscience to destroy a prince  Hubert  My Lord  John  Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause  When I spake darkly what I purposed  Or turned an eye of doubt upon my face  Or bid me tell my tale in express words  Deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off  And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me  But thou didst understand me by my signs  And didst in signs again parley with sin  Yea without stop didst let thy heart consent  And consequently thy rude hand to act  The deed which both our tongues held vile to name  Out of my sight and never see me more  My nobles leave me and my state is braved  Even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers  Nay in the body of this fleshy land  This kingdom this confine of blood and breath  Hostility and civil tumult reign  Between my conscience and my cousin's death  Doctor Johnson has made a comment on the latter part of this Scene which the Reader has a right to claim in this place  There are many touches of Nature in this conference of John with Hubert A man engaged in wickedness would keep the profit to himself and transfer the guilt to his accomplice These reproaches vented against Hubert are not the words of art or policy but the eruptions of a mind swelling with the consciousness of a crime and desirous of discharging its misery on another  This account of the timidity of guilt  hadst thou but shook thy head  c is drawn  ab ipsis recessibus mentis  from an intimate knowledge of mankind particularly that line in which he says that  to have bid him tell his tale in express words  would have  struck him dumb  Nothing is more certain than that bad men use all the arts of fallacy upon themselves palliate their actions to their own minds by gentle terms and hide themselves from their own detection in ambiguities and subterfuges  SCENE VII  When Hubert has been suspected and charged with the murder of prince Arthur the speech of Faulconbridge to him is finely expressive of the strength of despair arising from a guilty conscience  If thou didst but consent  To this most cruel act do but despair  And if thou want'st a cord  the smallest thread    That ever spider twisted from her womb  Will strangle thee a rush will be a beam  To hang thee on  Or would'st thou drown thyself  Put but a little water in a spoon  And it shall be as all the ocean  Enough to stifle such a villain up  ACT V  SCENE I  The manner and spirit with which great personages should act on extraordinary occasions of difficulty or danger are bravely pointed out by the gallant Faulconbridge in the following speech to king John when the French had invaded his kingdom  Faulconbridge  But wherefore do you droop Why look you sad  Be great in act as you have been in thought  Let not the world see fear and sad distrust  Govern the motion of a kingly eye  Be stirring as the time be fire with fire  Threaten the threatener and outface the brow  Of bragging horror So shall inferior eyes  That borrow their behaviours from the great  Grow great by your example and put on  The dauntless spirit of resolution  Away and glitter like the God of War  When he intendeth to become the field  Shew boldness and aspiring confidence  What shall they seek the lion in his den  And fright him there and make him tremble there  O let it not be said  Forage  Forage  to range abroad this is its original sense and so used here  and run  To meet displeasure farther from the doors  And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh  SCENE II  The struggles and compunctions of a good mind upon the being necessitated to take that part in a public cause which in polity is stiled Rebellion and also the horrid nature of a Civil War are finely and justly drawn here  Salisbury  and the  Dauphin  Salisbury  And noble Dauphin albeit we swear  A voluntary zeal and unurged faith  To your proceedings yet believe me Prince  I am not glad that such a sore of time  Should seek a plaister by contemned revolt  And heal the inveterate canker of one wound  By making manyOh it grieves my soul  That I must draw this metal from my side  To be a widowmakerOh and there  Where honourable rescue and defence  Cries out upon the name of Salisbury  But such is the infection of the time  That for the health and physic of our right  We cannot deal but with the very hand  Of stern injustice and confused wrong  And is't not pity oh my grieved friends  That we the sons and children of this isle  Were born to see so sad an hour as this  Wherein we step after a stranger march  Upon her gentle bosom and fill up  Her enemies ranks I must withdraw and weep  Upon the spot of this enforced cause  To grace the gentry of a land remote  And follow unacquainted colours here  What hereO nation that thou couldst remove  That Neptune' arms who clippeth thee about  Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself  And grapple thee unto a Pagan shore  Where these two Christian armies might combine  The blood of malice in a vein of league  And not to spend it so unneighbourly  The answer to this speech is fine it pays due honour to the generous conflict in the speaker's breast and makes a distinction between the effects of male and female tears paying the usual but too partial compliment to the former Be it soThe first are stronger on account of their being more rare owing solely to the superior harshness of men's natures but as the passions and feelings which the spectator is sensible of from each are so very different in their nature too I cannot see how any sort of comparison can be fairly made between them  Dauphin  A noble temper dost thou shew in this  And great affection wrestling in thy bosom  Doth make an earthquake of nobility  Oh what a noble combat hast thou fought  Between compulsion and a brave respect  Let me wipe off this honourable dew  That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks  My heart hath melted at a lady's tears  Being an ordinary inundation  But this effusion of such manly drops  This shower blown up by tempest of the soul  Sta  tles mine eyes and makes me more amazed  Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven  Figured quite o'er with burning meteors  Lift up thy brow renowned Salisbury  And with a great heart heave away this storm  Commend these waters to those babyeyes  That never saw the giant world enraged  Nor met with fortune other than at feasts  Fullwarm of blood of mirth of gossipping  SCENE X  Salisbury speaking to King John perceives him dead  My Liege my Lord  but now a kingNow thus  This would make a good epitaph for a royal Sepulchre  This Play closes with one truth in fact and another in prophecy which I hope all time will vouch the inspiration of  Faulconbridge  This England never did nor ever shall  Lye at the proud foot of a conqueror  But when it first did help to wound itself  Now these her  Princes  The revolted Nobles  are come home again  Come the three corners of the world in arms  And we shall shock them  Nought shall make us rue    If England to itself do rest

motive by which the accuser appears to be actuated that the credit of his testimony may be rated accordingly  When the King calls the suit of Bolinbroke against Norfolk upon trial he speaks thus to the father of the former  King  Old John of Gaunt  timehonoured  Lancaster  Hast thou according to thy oath and bond  Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son  Here to make good the boisterous late appeal  Which then our leisure would not let us hear  Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray  Lancaster  I have my liege  King  Tell me moreover hast thou sounded him  If he appeal the Duke on antient malice  Or worthily as a good subject should  On some known ground of treachery in him  Lancaster  As near as I could sift him on that argument  On some apparent danger seen in him  Aimed at your Highness no inveterate malice  King  Then call them to our presence face to face  And frowning brow to brow Ourselves will hear  The accuser and the accused freely speak  SCENE II  When the King forbids the combat and commands the Duke of Norfolk to throw down Bolinbroke's gage  A  gage  or  ga  ntlet  was a sort of iron glove or piece of armour for the hand thrown down in defiance in the old Chivalry and taken up by the antagonist upon an acceptance of the challenge  he answers with the true spirit of a gallant nobleman  Norfolk  Myself I throw dread sovereign at thy foot  My life thou shalt command but not my shame  The one my duty owes but my fair name  Despite of death that lives upon my grave  To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have  I am disgraced impeached and baffled here  Pierced to the soul with slander's venomed spear  The which no balm can cure but his heartblood  Which breathed the poison  It was an old notion in physic that the blood of a viper applied to the wound would cure its      King  Rage must be withstood  Give him his gageLions make leopards tame  Norfolk  Yea but not change their spots Take but my shame  And I resign my gage My dear dear lord  The purest treasure mortal times afford  I  spo  reputation that away  Men are but gilded loam or painted clay  A jewel in a tentimesbarr'dup chest  Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast  Mine honour is my life both grow in one  Take honour from me and my life is done  Then dear my liege mine honour let me try  In that I live and for that I will die  Afterwards when Bolinbroke is called upon to the same purpose he also replies as bravely but as he expresses himself in so much an inferior manner to the former I think it could afford the reader no great entertainment to have the passage quoted  SCENE IV  When the King sentences these two champions to exile he exacts an oath from them both not to be reconciled to one another abroad so far as to confederate against the state of England in the administering of which bond he desires them to  Swear by the duty that you owe to Heaven  Our part therein we banish with yourselves  Upon which latter line Doctor Warburton gives the following note  It is a question much debated among the writers on the  Law of Nations  whether a banished man be still tied in allegiance to the state which sent him into exile Tully and Clarendon declare for the affirmative Hobbes and Puffendorf hold  the negative Our Author by this line seems to be of the latter opinion  But I agree intirely with Cicero and Clarendon The undergoing any penalty of law cannot dissolve either the moral or the political duty we owe our country Socrates by refusing to escape out of prison shewed that he thought his obedience and submission to the state continued still to be obligatory on him even though the decree was unjust and the sentence death And under the  Ostracism  which imposed banishment upon men for their very eminence and virtue we do not hear of the illustrious exiles either speaking or acting as if they deemed their allegiance to have been cancelled  Nay Aristides carried the submission of a good subject so far as to think himself obliged in duty to write his own name on a  shell  at the request of an illiterate citizen of Athens who voted against him on that very law And Themistocles though banished through the spirit of faction not that of the laws and kindly entertained and preferred in the armies of Persia chose to swallow poison rather than march against his country  'Tis not the community that banishes a man but the laws which govern it  "It is the law not I condemns your brother  Angelo to Isabella  Measure for Measure    These surely are no object of resentment and to rise in arms against a nation because one of its statutes had fallen heavy upon us would be just as rational as to set a forest on fire because we had received the bastinado by a cudgel that was taken out of it  SCENE V  King  and  Lancaster  King  Why uncle Thou hast many years to live  Lancaster  But not a minute king that thou canst give  Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow  And pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow  Thou canst help time to furrow me with age  But step no wrinkle in his pilgrimage  Thy word is current with him for my death  But dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath  Upon which passage there is the following reflection in the note by Doctor Johnson  It is matter of very melancholy consideration that all human advantages confer more power of doing evil than good  A very melancholy reflection indeed were we to suppose it true  In the instance before us the hand of power strength or treachery may certainly deprive us of a life which it cannot restore but Shakespeare does not mean to make the reflection universal A good Prince may render his whole people happy a bad one can only affect a part When tyranny becomes general it defeats itself at the cost of the oppressor  If my objection to the above uncomfortable maxim be valid in the highest example it would be trifling to adduce any lesser ones to prove it  SCENE VI  Lancaster by way of comforting his son upon the sentence of banishment paraphrases and poeticises the old English sentence of  every place is an honest men's home  in these words  All places that the eye of heaven visits  Are to a wise man po  ts and happy havens  which lines are followed by a long and equivocal declamation in the stile of the Stoic philosophy to which Bolinbroke impatiently replies in a manner perfectly natural to the unhappy for it requires  leisure  to grow wise nor is this ever effected by our becoming better able to bear misfortune but by our feeling it less from use and habit  B  l    Oh who can hold a fire in his hand  By thinking on the frostly  Caucasus  Or wallow naked in December's snow  By thinking on fantastic summer's heat  Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite  By bare imagination of a feast  I have transposed these four lines to preserve the order of the images    Oh no the apprehension of the good  Gives but the greater feeling to the worse  Fell Sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more  Than when it bites but lanceth not the sore  ACT II  SCENE I  The weight of persuasion which the admonitions of a dying person are apt to impress upon the mind more than the most lively remonstrances of one in perfect health is well expressed here The circumstances of the time impress us with an awe which imprints the advice more strongly on our memory and gives it additional authority  Lancaster brought in sick attended by the Duke of York  Lancaster  Will the king come that I may breathe my last  In wholesome counsel to his unstayed youth  York  Vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath  For all in vain comes counsel to his ear  Lancaster  Oh but they say the tongues of dying men  Enforce attention like deep harmony  Where words are scarce they're seldom spent in vain  For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain  He that no more must say is listened more  Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose  To  glose  to flatter    More are men's ends marked than their lives before  The setting sun and music in the close  As the last taste of sweets is sweetest last  Writ in remembrance more than things long past  Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear  My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear  In the continuation of this dialogue the fatal consequences to a Prince of illchosen favourites the danger of suffering foreign fashions and manners to be introduced into a state with an enumerative description of the peculiar advantages of England with regard to its situation and other happy circumstances are strongly pointed out  York  His ear is stopt with other flattering charms  As praises of his state there are beside  Lascivious meeters  Companions or associates in debauch  to whose venomed sound  The open ear of youth doth always listen  Report of fashions in proud Italy  Whose manners still our tardy apish nation  Limps after in base aukward imitation  Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity  So it be new there's no respect how vile  That is not quickly buzzed into his ears  Then all too late comes counsel to be heard  Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard  Direct not him whose way himself will chuse  'Tis breath thou lack'st and that breath wilt thou lose  Lancaster  Methinks I am a prophet new inspired  And thus expiring do foretel of him  His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last  For violent fires soon burn out themselves  Small showers last long but sudden storms are short  He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes  With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder  Light vanity insatiate cormorant  Consuming means soon preys upon itself  This royal throne of kings this sceptred isle  This earth of majesty this seat of Mars  This other Eden demiparadise  This fortress built by Nature for herself  Against infection and the hand of war  This happy breed of men this little world  This precious stone set in the silver sea  Which serves it in the office of a wall  Or as a moat defensive to a house  Against the envy of less happy lands  This nurse this teeming womb of royal kings  Feared for their breed and famous for their birth  For Christian service and true chivalry  Renowned for their deeds as far from home  As is the Sepulchre in stubborn  Jewry  In the text the word is  Jury  which must be a mistake though it has run through all the editions The alterations and transpositions in the three foregoing lines are copied from Doctor Johnson's hint    Of the world's ransom blessed Mary's son  This land of such dear souls this dear dear land  Dear for her reputation through the world  Is now leased out I die pronouncing it  Like to a tenement or pelting farm  England bound in with the triumphant sea  Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege  Of watery Neptune is bound in with shame  With inky blots and rotten parchmentbonds  That England that was wont to conquer others  Hath made a shameful conquest of itself  The latter part of this speech seems to be as prophetical as the first if we compare it to the state of our national debtto our stocksby which we have long since become  tenants  to foreigners  SCENE V  There are undoubtedly certain notices or premonitions in the order of Providence which mankind have been frequently sensible of sometimes from dreams at other times from unaccountable impressions on the mind foreboding particular misfortunes of our lives let philosophy reason against the notion ever so wisely  Indeed there appears one argument to oppose this opinion which in any indifferent case might be thought sufficiently able to overthrow it which is that such hints rarely if ever have been found to answer any other purpose than to render us unhappy before our time  But matter of fact is not to be controverted by syllogism The objection only serves to resolve it into a mystery and leaves it still uninvestigable by human science The more of such inexplicable secrets of Providence which fall under our observation the better as they may serve to rouze the Atheist from his lethargy and afford the Deist occasion to suspect at least that what he calls  Natural Religion  is not the intire scheme of the Divine oeconomy with regard to men  There are more things in heaven and earth  Horatio  Than are dreamt of in your philosophy  HAMLET  Here follows the passage which gave rise to the above reflection  The  Queen  and  Bushy    Bushy  Madam your majesty is much too sad  You promised when you parted from the king  To lay aside selfharming heaviness  And entertain a chearful disposition  Queen  To please the king I did to please myself  I cannot do it yet I know no cause  Why I should welcome such a guest as grief  Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest  As my sweet Richard Yet again methinks  Some unborn sorrow ripe in fortune's womb  Is coming toward me and my inward soul  With something trembles yet at nothing grieves  This line is altered for the better by Doctor Warburton    More than with parting from my lord the king  Bushy  Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows  Which shew like grief itself but are not so  For sorrow's eye glazed with blinding tears  Divides one thing intire to many objects  Like perspectives which rightly gazed upon  Shew nothing but confusion eyed awry  Distinguish form  A  ng a method of drawing called  inverted perspective  among the mathematical re  tions  So your sweet majesty  Looking awry upon your lord's departure  Finds shapes of grief more than himself to wail  Which looked on as it is is nought but shadows  Of what it is not Gracious Queen then weep not  More than your lord's departure more's not seen  Or if it be 'tis with false sorrow's eye  Which for things true weeps things imaginary  Queen  It may be so but yet my inward soul  Persuades me otherwise Howe'er it be  I cannot but be sad so heavysad  As though on thinking on no thought I think  Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink  Bushy  'Tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady  Queen  'Tis nothing less conceit is still derived  From some forefather grief mine is not so  For nothing hath begot my something grief  Not something hath the nothing that I grieve  'Tis in reversion that I do possess  That is  ▪  has possessed my mind  Johnson    But what it is that is not yet known what  I cannot name is nameless woe I wot  Shakespeare has given a description of the same complexion of mind before in the person of Anthonio in the Merchant of Venice See my first remark on the First Scene of the First Act of that Play  SCENE IX  Hope has been often termed the  assuager of our grief  but Shakespeare has justly raised it to an higher character by making it an  augmentation to our joys  also  Bolinbroke  And hope to joy is little less in joy  Than hope enjoyed  ACT III  SCENE II  The bishop of Carlisle endeavouring to awaken the king to a manly exertion of his spirit against the rebellion and neither to trust to the weak defence of right against might nor expect that Providence shall out of respect to his  divine right  fight his battles for him while he looks idly on says  The means that Heaven yields must be embraced  And not neglected else if Heaven would  And we would not Heaven's offer we refuse  The proffered means of succour and redress  To which the king after expressing a contempt for Bolinbroke and his adherents makes a reply agreeable to the vain notion and political superstition of those times with regard to the absurd doctrine of  indefeasible right    King  Not all the water in the rough rude sea  Can wash the balm from an anointed king  The breath of worldly men cannot depose  The deputy elected by the Lord  For every man that Bolinbroke hath prest  To lift sharp steel against our golden crown  Heaven for his Richard hath in heavenly pay  A glorious angel then if angels fight  Weak men must fall for Heaven still guards the right  SCENE III  However he afterwards begins to speak more rationally upon this subject for though he appears a little cast down at first yet on hearing some further ill news he rouzes himself again in the following speech  King  I had forgot myself Am I not king  Awake thou coward majesty thou sleep'st  Is not the king's name fortythousand names  There is the same thought in Richard the Third "Besides the king's name "is a  of strength"    Arm arm my name a puny subject strikes  At thy great glory Look not to the ground  Ye favourites of a king are we not high  High be our thoughts  SCENE IV  But this poor abdicating king had no true heroism in his soul for upon the intelligence of some more cross events arriving to him just after he suddenly drops the character of a fighting prince and immediately sinks into that of a preaching priest  Enter  Scroop  Scroop  More health and happiness betide my liege  Than can my caretun'd tongue deliver him  King  Mine ear is open and mine heart prepared  The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold  Say is my kingdom lost Why 'twas my care  And what loss is it to be rid of care  Strives Bolinbroke to be as great as we  Greater he shall not be if he serve God  We'll serve him too and be his fellow so  Revolt our subjects that we cannot mend  They break their faith to God as well as us  Cry woe destruction ruin loss decay  The worst is death and death will have his day  This kind of homily he continues afterwards in the same Scene including however some good reflections on the unstable and unsatisfactory state of mortality even in the highest spheres of life which would have become his confessor better than they did himself as the spirited Bishop a true son of  the church militant  tells him in the close of the following passage  Aumerle  Where is the duke my father with his power  King  No matter whereOf comfort no man speak  Let's talk of graves of worms of epitaphs  Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes  Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth  Let's chuse executors and talk of wills  And yet not sofor what can we bequeath  Save our deposed bodies to the ground  Our lands our lives our all are Bolinbroke's  And nothing can we call our own but death  And that small model of the barren earth  Which serves as paste and cover to our bones  For Heaven's sake let us sit upon the ground  And tell sad stories of the death of kings  How some had been deposed some slain in war  Some haunted by the ghosts they dispossessed  Some poisoned by their wives some sleeping killed  In these three lines our author seems to have minuted down notes for his Henry VI Richard III Macbeth and Hamlet    All murtheredFor within the hollow crown  That rounds the mortal temples of a king  Keeps Death his court and there the antick sits  Scoshing his state and grinning at his pomp  Allowing him a breath a little scene  To monarchize be feared and kill with looks  Infusing him with self and vain conceit  As if this flesh which walls about our life  Were brass impregnable and humoured thus  Comes at the last and with a little pin  Bores thro' his castlewalls and farewel king  Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood  With solemn reverence throw away respect  Tradition  By this expression may be meant the popular superstition of  the divine right of kings    form and ceremonious duty  For you have but mistook me all this while  I live on bread like you feel want like you  Taste grief need friends like youSubjected thus  How can you say to me Thou art a king  Bishop  My lord wise men ne'er wail their present woes  But presently prevent the ways to wail  To fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength  Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe  And so your follies fight against yourself  Fear and be slain no worse can come from fight  And fight and die is death destroying death  Where fearing dying pays death servile breath  There are several other passages of the same kind in this and the subsequent Act where Richard alternately rises to a vain confidence in his  indefeasible right  and then sinks again under a despondency about his fortunes which I shall not disgust the Reader with here as the representation of a great  man suffering misfortunes meanly is rather an object of contempt than of compassion  In the latter part of this Scene upon his finding matters growing worse and worse he exclaims  By Heaven I'll hate him everlastingly  That bids me be of comfort any more  Doctor Johnson has prevented my observation on this passage by a note of his upon it  This sentiment is drawn from Nature Nothing is more offensive to a mind convinced that its distress is without a remedy and preparing to submit quietly to irresistible calamity than those petty and conjectured comforts which unskilful officiousness thinks it virtue to administer  ACT V  SCENE I  There is something however extremely affecting in what this unhappy man says to his queen upon her lamenting the misery of his situation  King  Join not with grief  fair woman  do not so  To make my end too sudden  This short sentence lays hold of the heart makes us forget him as a king and feel for him as a man The fondness of his expression too of  fair woman  increases the tenderness of our regret at the additional unhappiness of their separation  SCENE II  This poor moralizing prince makes a very just observation here on the nature of all alliances in vice  The  King  to  Northumberland  Northumberland thou ladder wherewithal  The mounting Bolinbroke ascends my throne  The time shall not be many hours of age  More than it is ere soul sin gathering head  Shall break into corruption thou shalt think  Though he divide the realm and give thee half  It is too little helping him to all  And he shall think that thou who know'st the way  To plant unrightful kings wilt know again  Being neer so little urged another way  To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne  The love of wicked friends converts to fear  That fear to hate and hate turns one or both  To worthy danger and deserved death  A further and stronger reflection upon such vicious connections occurs in the last Scene of this Play which I shall bring forward here before its time where Exton who had murdered Richard brings an account of his great service to Bolinbroke  Bolinbroke  They love not poison that do poison need  Nor do I theethough I did wish him dead  I hate the murderer love him murdered  The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour  But neither my good word nor princely favour  With Cain go wander through the shade of night  And never shew thy head by day or light  SCENE X  The following soliloquy in which the state of the mind is compared to that of the world though the thought is rather too much laboured deserves to be quoted on account of the beauties it contains the reflections it supplies as well as for the moral compassion and generous resentment with which it is capable of inspiring the virtuous Reader for the unhappy speaker  King  in prison at  Pomfret  Castle  I have been studying how to compare  This prison where I live unto the world  And for because the world is populous  And here is not a creature but myself  I cannot do it yet I'll hammer on't  My brain I'll prove  Prove  for  suppose  the female to my soul  My soul the father and these two beget  A generation of stillbreeding thoughts  And these same thoughts people this little world  In humour like the people of this world  For no thought is contented  The better sort  As thoughts of things divine are intermixt  With scruples and do set the  word  itself  Against the  word  as thus  Come little ones    And then again  It is as hard to come as for a camel  To bread the p  s  on of a needle's eye  I do not see how these texts contradict each other They are spoken of different objects Children surely may go to Heaven though misers may not    Thoughts tending to ambition they do plot  Unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails  May tear a passage through the flinty ribs  Of this hard world my ragged prison walls  And for they cannot die in their own pride  Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves  That they are not the first of fortune's slaves  And shall not be the last like silly beggars  Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame  That many have and others must sit there  And in this thought they find a kind of ease  Bearing their own misfortune on the back  Of such as have before endured the like  Thus play I in one prison many people  And none contented  Sometimes am I a king  Then treason makes me wish myself a beggar  And so I am Then crushing penury  Persuades me I was better when a king  Then am I king'd again and by and by  Think that I am unking'd by Bolinbroke  And straight am nothing But whate'er I am  Nor I nor any man that but man is  With nothing will be pleased till he be eas'd  With being nothing  The last reflection has been so often made and remarked upon before in the course of this Work that I shall leave it unnoticed here and so conclude my observations on this Play  HENRY the FOURTH FIRST PART  Dramatis Personae  MEN  HENRY the Fourth  HENRY Prince of Wales  EARL OF WORCESTER  HOTSPUR  GLENDOWER  MORTIMER  DOUGLAS  FALSTAFF  WOMEN  LADY PERCY wife to Hotspur  LADY MORTIMER  HENRY the FOURTH FIRST PART  ACT I  SCENE I  IN the first speech here Henry the Fourth in order to encourage his subjects to attend him with the better spirit on the  Crusade  expedition which he had then resolved upon gives a horrid description of their former state of civil war which the kingdom was happily at that time free from  King  No more the thirsty  entrails  The word in the text is  entrance  which has puzzled all the Commentators I am surprized at it for I think the alteration I have made so obvious that I hardly claim any merit from it  of this soil  Shall  trempe  Soak  or  sleep  her lips with her own children's blood  No more shall trenching war channel her fields  Nor bruise her flowrets with the armed hoofs  Of hostile paces Those opposed files  Which like the meteors of a troubled Heaven  All of one nature of one substance bred  Did lately meet in the intestine shock  And furious close of civil butchery  Shall now in mutual wellbeseeming ranks  March all one way and be no more opposed  Against acquaintance kindred and allies  The edge of war like an illsheathed knife  No more shall cut his master  SCENE II  The method that men take to disguise the nature of their vices by palliating epithets is of dangerous consequences in life It not only serves to blunt the edge of remorse in ourselves but often helps to induce a milder censure in others upon the most flagrant enormities  Thus a prostigate fellow who debauches every woman in his power is stiled  a man of galantry  a pennyless adventurer who carries off a rich heiress  is called  a soldier of fortune  a duellist dubbed with the title of  a man of honour  a sharper  un chevalier d'industrie  an atheist a  freethinker  and so forth  A good specimen of this sort of deceitful phraseology is presented to us in part of this Scene  Falstaff  to the Prince    Marry then sweet wag when thou art king let not us that are  squires  of the night's body be called thieves of the day's booty Let us be  Diana's foresters gentlemen of the shade minions of the moon  and let them say we be  men of good government  being governed as the sea is by  our noble and chaste mistress the moon  under whose countenance we steal  Pistol in some other place says of  stealing    convey  the wise it call  Merry Wives of Windsor    SCENE III  I think I may venture to pronounce for the honour of human nature that the most abandoned person breathing means not to pass his whole life in a state of profligacy He purposes from time to time  to take up  as the phrase is but is too apt from time to time to procrastinate his amendment thus silencing the clamours of his conscience by the hopeful design of reformation and thinking his repentance sufficiently advanced by a selfconfession of his vice or immorality  The danger of this species of  quietism  is strongly pointed out in part of a work lately published and as it may afford a useful warning to some of my dissipated readers I shall quote the passage I allude to here  An  EPITAPH  on Human Life  Eheu fugaces Postume P stume  Labuntur anni  HOR  Be early wise lest prudence come too late  Think how  tomorrow  steals from us  today    And leaves the spendthrift further in arrear  To purposes unfinished till old Time  Who lends on usury  calls in the account  And takes the body for its debt unpaid  Foreclosing life in the insolvent tomb  Something New    The following speech affords us a beautiful instance of this method of amusing our too flexible and indolent tempers of mind which I copy here with the greater pleasure as the speaker of it did effectually reform his life and manners and has enriched the annals of England with a memoir of true glory  The Prince of Wales speaking of his loose companions who had just quitted the scene says  I know ye all and will awhile uphold  The unyoked humour of your idleness  Yet herein will I imitate the sun  Who doth permit the base contagious clouds  To smother up his beauty from the world  That when he please again to be himself  Being wanted he may be more wondered at  By breaking through the soul and ugly mists  Of vapours that did seem to strangle him  If all the year were playing holidays  To sport would be as tedious as to work  But when they seldom come they wished for come  And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents  So when this loose behaviour I throw off  And pay the debt I never promised  By how much better than my word I am  By so much shall I  falsify  Falsify  for  exceed  Doctor Johnson  men's hopes  And like bright metal on a sullen ground  My reformation glittering o'er my fault  Shall shew more goodly and attract more eyes  Than that which hath no soil to set it off  I'll so offend to make offence a skill  Redeeming time when men think least I will  SCENE IV  When the brave Hotspur is taxed by the king with having refused to surrender the prisoners which he had taken at the gallant action of  HolmedonMoor  to his order the speech he makes upon that occasion in excuse for his refractoriness presents us with a  very natural description of the uneasy froward and difficult temper of mind a person is subject to in such circumstances as he paints himself to be at the time mentioned and also entertains us with a character admirably and humorously drawn of a pert foppish and affected Court minion The contrast of the two figures here before us would make an excellent picture on canvas  Hotspur  My liege I did deny no prisoners  But I remember when the fight was done  When I was dry with rage and extreme toil  Breathless and faint leaning upon my sword  Came there a certain lord neat trimly drest  Fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reaped  Shewed like a stubble land at harvest home  He was perfumed like a milliner  And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held  A pouncetbox which ever and anon  He gave his nose and took't away again  And still he smiled and talked  And as the soldiers bare dead bodies by  He called them untaught knaves unmannerly  To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse  Betwixt the wind and his nobility  With many holiday and lady terms  He questioned meAmong the rest demanded  My prisoners on your majesty's behalf  I then all smarting with my wounds grown cold  Out of my grief and my impatience  To be so pestered with a popinjay  These lines are transposed as hinted by Doctor Johnson    Answered neglectingly I know not what  He should or should not for he made me mad  To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet  And talk so like a waiting gentlewoman  Of guns and drums and woundsGod save the mark  And telling me the sov'reignest thing on earth  Was  Parmacity  A corruption of the word  sperma  e  i    for an inward bruise  And that it was great pity  so it was    That villainous saltpetre should be digg'd  Out of the bowels of the harmless earth  Which many a good tall fellow had destroyed  So cowardly And but for these vile guns  He would himself have been a soldier  This bold unjointed chat of his my lord  I answered indirectly as I said  And I beseech you let not this report  Come current for an accusation  Betwixt my love and your high majesty  The king not being satisfied with his apology says to him after some prior altercation between them  Send me your prisoners with the speediest means  Or you shall hear in such a kind from me  As will displease you  Send us your prisoners or you'll hear of it  Exit  Upon this menace the impatient temper of Hotspur breaks out into the following expressions which though the substance of them does not fall within the purpose of this Work I shall however repeat here and also continue the dialogue a good deal further as it leads to the character of the speaker which I design to give a description of in the close of my observations on the two next Plays  Hotspur  And if the devil come and roar for them  I will not send them I'll after strait  And tell him so for I will ease my heart  Although it be with hazard of my head  And again to the same purpose  I'll keep them all  By Heaven he shall not have a Scot of them  No if a Scot would save his soul he shall not  I'll keep them by this hand  Worcester  You start away  And lend no ear unto my purposes  Those prisoners you shall keep  Hotspur  I will that's flat  He said he would not ransom Mortimer  Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer  This was in part of the altercation between them in this scene not quoted above    But I will find him when he lies asleep  And in his ear I'll holla Mortimer  Nay I will have a starling taught to speak  Nothing but Mortimer and give it him  To keep his anger still in motion  Worcester  Hear you cousin a word  Hotspur  All studies here I solemnly defy  Save how to gall and pinch this Bolinbroke  And that same swashbuckler the Prince of Wales  But that I think his father loves him not  And would be glad he met with some mischance  I'd have him poisoned with a pot of ale  Worcester  Farewel my kinsman I will talk to you  When you are better tempered to attend  Northumberland  Why what a wasptongued and impatient fool  Art thou to break into this woman's mood  Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own  Hotspur  Why look you I am whipt and scourged with rods  Nettled and stung with pismires when I hear  Of this vile politician Bolinbroke  In Richard's timeWhat do you call the place  A plague upon'tit is in Glostershire  'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept  His uncle Yorkwhere I first bowed my knee  Unto this  king of smiles  this Bolinbroke  When you and he came back from Ràvenspurg  Northumberland  At Berkley Castle  Hotspur  You say true  Why what a deal of candied courtesy  This fawning greyhound then did proffe me  Look  when his infant fortune came of age  And  gentle Harry Percy  and  kind cousin    The devil take such  cozeners  God forgive me  Good uncle tell your tale for I have done  The precarious confidence that men can venture to place in unwarrantable services performed for another is well marked in the same scene by one of the disloyal conspirators who had assisted Henry to dethrone king Richard  Worcester  For bear ourselves as even as we can  The king will always think him in our debt  And think we deem ourselves unsatisfied  Till he hath found a time to  pay us home    The Reader may here refer back to the quotation from the Second Scene in the Fifth Act of the former Play  ACT III  SCENE I  In this truly  comic  Scene which may be the rather stiled so because there is no  buffoonery  in it and which I therefore think preferable even to the humour of Falstaff the vanity of old Glendower in supposing himself to have been a peculiar object of the notice of Providence which has however been the foible of several great men Caesar c with the vulgar ignorance of mistaking natural events for miracles is finely contrasted with the careless humour sturdy spirit and rational investigation of Hotspur  It would be doing injustice to the dialogue to parcel it out as it refers singly to the several articles above specified therefore I shall entertain my readers with the whole passage intire leaving them to mark the application in their own minds which will occur in their proper places  Glendower Hotspur Worcester  and  Mortimer  Mortimer  These promises are fair the parties sure  And our induction  Beginning  or  entrance upon action  full of prosperous hope  Hotspur  Lord Mortimer and cousin Glendower  Will you sit down  And uncle Worcestera plague upon't  I have forgot the map  Glendower  No here it is  Sit cousin Percysit good cousin Hotspur  For by that name as oft as Lancaster  Doth speak of you his cheek looks pale and with  A rising figh he wisheth you in Heaven  Hotspur  And you in hell as often as he hears  Owen Glendower spoke of  Glendower  I blame him notAt my nativity  The front of Heaven was full of fiery shapes  Of burning cressets  Bonfires  or any blazing light  Know that at my birth  The frame and the foundation of the earth  Shook like a coward  Hotspur  And so it would have done  At the same season if your mother's cat  Had kittened though yourself had ne'er been born  Glendower  I say the earth did shake when I was born  Hotspur  I say the earth then was not of my mind  If you suppose as fearing you it shook  Glendower  The Heavens were all on fire the earth did tremble  Hotspur  O then the earth shook to see the Heavens on fire  And not in fear of your nativity  Diseased Nature oftentimes breaks forth  In strange eruptions and the teeming earth  Is with a kind of cholic pinched and vext  By the imprisoning of unruly wind  Within her womb which for enlargement striving  Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down  High towers and mossgrown steeples At your birth  Our grandam earth with this distemperature  In passion shook  Glendower  Cousin of many men  I do not bear these crossings Give me leave  To tell you once again that at my birth  The front of Heaven was full of fiery shapes  The goats ran from the mountains and the herds  Were strangely clamorous in the frighted fields  These signs have marked me extraordinary  And all the courses of my life do shew  I am not in the roll of common men  Where is he living clipt in with the sea  That chides the banks of England Wales or Scotland  Who calls me pupil or hath read to me  And bring him out that is but woman's son  Can trace me in the tedious ways of art  Or hold me pace in deep experiments  Hotspur  I think there's no man speaks better Welch  I'll to dinner  Mortimer  Peace cousin Percy you will make him mad  Glendower  I can call spirits from the vasty deep  Hotspur  Why so can I or so can any man  But will they come when you do call for them  Glendower  Why I can teach thee to command the devil  Hotspur  And I can teach thee coz to shame the devil  By telling truth  Tell  uth and shame the devil    If thou hast power to raise him bring him hither  And Ill be sworn I've power to shame him hence  O while you live  till truth and shame the devil    Mortimer  Come come  No more of this unprofitable chat  Glendower  Three times hath Henry Bolinbroke made head  Against my power thrice from the banks of Wye  And sandybottomed Severn have I sent  Him bootless home and weatherbeaten back  Hotspur  Home without boots and in soul weather too  How scaped he agues in the Devil's name  Glendower  Come here's the map shall we divide our right  According to our threefold order taken  Hotspur  Methink my portion north from Burton here  In quantity equals not one of yours  See how this river comes me crankling in  And cuts me from the best of all my land  An huge half moon a monstrous cantle out  I'll have the current in this place dammed up  And here the smug and silver Trent shall run  In a new channel fair and evenly  It shall not wind with such a deep indent  To rob me of so rich a bottom here  Glendower  Not wind It shall it must you see it doth  Hotspur  I'll have it so a little charge will do it  Glendower  I will not have it altered  Hotspur  Will not you  Glendower  No nor you shall not  Hotspur  Who shall say me  nay  Glendower  Why that will I  Hotspur  Let me not understand you then  Speak it in Welch  Glendower  I can speak English lord as well as you  For I was trained up in the English court  Where being young I framed to the harp  Many an English ditty lovely well  And gave the tongue  The English language  a helpful ornament  A virtue that was never seen in you  Hotspur  Marry and I'm glad of it with all my heart  I had rather be a kitten and cry  mew  Than one of these same metre balladmongers  I'd rather hear a brazen candlestick turned  Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree  And that would nothing set my teeth on edge  Nothing so much as mincing poetry  'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag  Glendower  Come you shall have Trent turned  Hotspur  I do not careI'll give thrice so much land  To any welldeserving friend  But in the way of bargain mark ye me  I'll cavil on the ninth part of an hair  SCENE II  Again after Glendower goes away  Mortimer  Fie cousin Percy how you cross my father  Hotspur  I cannot chuse Sometimes he angers me  With telling of the moldwarp and the ant  Hall's Chronicles say that some such prediction had induced Glendower to rise against Henry the Fourth    Of dreamer Merlin and his prophecies  And of a dragon and a finless fish  A cliptwing griffin and a moulting raven  A couching lion and a rampant cat  And such a deal of skimble skamble stuff  As puts me from my faith I tell you what  He held me the last night at least three hours  In reckoning up the several devils names  That were his lackeysI cried  hum  and  well    But marked him not a wordO he's as tedious  As a tired horse or as a railing wise  Worse than a smokey house I'd rather live  With  cheese and garlic  Welch fare  in a windmill far  Than seed on  ca  es  V  ands or savoury meats  and have him talk to me  In any summerhouse in christendom  SCENE III  Here is a beautiful description given of that most pleasing crisis of mind and body between sleeping and waking when the passions are just subsiding to rest but the senses not yet deprived of their notices  Lady Mortimer daughter to Glendower not being able to speak any language but Welch to her husband which he does not understand the father undertakes to interpret between them  Mortimer  O I am ignorance itself in this  Glendower  She bids you  All on the wanton rushes lay you down  And rest your gentle head upon her lap  And she will sing the song that pleaseth you  And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep  Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness  Making such difference betwixt wake and sleep  As is the difference betwixt day and night  The hour before the heavenly harnessed team  Begins his golden progress in the east  There is neither  metreballadmongers  stuff nor  mincing poetry  in the above speech If Glendower is not original in it he has at least the merit of a good translator  A little further on in the same scene the usual expletives of conversation and childish phrases of asseveration are humorously turned into ridicule  After lady Mortimer has sung her Welch song Hotspur in order to amuse his mind then pondering on momentous intents says to his wife  Come I'll have your song too  Lady Percy  Not mine  in good sooth    Hotspur  Not yours  in good sooth  Why you swear like a comfitmaker's wifeNot you  in good sooth  and  as true as I live  and  as God shall mend me  and  as sure as day  and givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths as if thou hadst never walked further than Finsbury  Swear me Kate like a lady as thou art  A good mouthfilling oath and leave  in sooth    And such protest of  pepper gingerbread  This is but an odd sort of simile for a  mild  note of affirmation The Commentators neither explain the meaning nor confess their ignorance about it 'Tis easy to be a critic on these terms    To velvet guards and Sunday citizens  Come sing  SCENE IV  This whole Scene is so beautiful so spirited and so affecting that it would be a massacre in literature to fever its members asunder which I should lay myself under the barbarous necessity of doing were the several sentiments observations and reflections which naturally arise from it suffered to challenge their several references separately I shall therefore serve up the compact body of it unbroken before the Reader and leave the dissection of its parts to his own judgment taste and feeling  Let the father who has an untoward son here learn how best to reprove let the youth whose  virtues are obscured by his errors be instructed how to reform let the sovereign who would preserve his dignity be hence taught how to maintain it and the king whose soibles have rendered him the object of contempt be herein warned of the dangerous consequences of his becoming despised  The  King  and the  Prince  of  Wales    King  I know not whether God will have it so  For some displeasing service I have done  That in his secret doom out of my blood  He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me  But thou dost in thy passages of life  Make me believe that thou art only marked  For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven  To punish my mistreadings Tell me else  Could such inordinate and low desires  Such poor such base such lewd such mean attaints  Such barren pleasures rude society  As thou art matched withal and grafted to  Accompany the greatness of thy blood  And hold their level with thy princely heart  Prince  So please your majesty I would I could  Quit  all  offences with as clear excuse  As well as I am doubtless I can purge  Myself of  many  I am charged withal  Yet such extenuation let me beg  As on reproof of many tales devised  Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear  By smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers  I may for some things true wherein my youth  Hath faulty wandered and irregular  Find pardon on my true submission  King  Heaven pardon thee Yet let me wonder Harry  At thy affections which do hold a wing  Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors  Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost  Which by thy younger brother is supplied  And art almost an alien to the hearts  Of all the court and princes of my blood  The hope and expectation of thy time  Is mined and the soul of every man  Prophetically does forethink thy fall  Had I so lavish of my presence been  So common hackneyed in the eyes of men  So stale and cheap to vulgar company  Opinion that did help me to the crown  Had still kept loyal to possession  True to the late king Richard the Second    And left me in reputeless banishment  A fellow of no mark or likelihood  But being seldom seen I could not stir  But like a comet I was wondered at  That men would tell their children  This is he    Others would say  Where Which is Bolin  roke  And then I stole all courtesy from heaven  Alluding to the theft of Prometheus    And dressed myself in such humility  That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts  Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths  Even in the presence of the crowned king  Thus I did keep my person fresh and new  My presence like a robe pontifical  Ne'er seen but wondered at and so my state  Seldom but sumptuous shewed like a feast  And won by rareness such solemnity  The skipping king he ambled up and down  With shallow jesters and rash  bavin  Bavin  a sort of slight fuel that catches fire quickly but wants substance to preserve it long  wits  Soon kindled and soon burnt 'scarded his state  Mingled his royalty with carping fools  Had his great name profaned with their scorns  And gave his countenance against his name  Sunk his dignity in mean familiarity    To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push  Of every beardless vain  comparative  Comparative  Any idle companion that would set himself on a level with him    Grew a companion to the common streets  Enfeoff'd himself to popularity  Gave the  livery and seizin  of his person away by exposing it too frequently to the public view    That being daily swallowed by men's eyes  They surfeited with honey and began  To loath a taste of sweetness  whereof a little  More than a little is by much too much  They deny Shakespeare to have been a classic scholar but one would fancy that he was both a master and admirer of Ovid by the  manly  and  puerile  stile he frequently mixes together in the same passage as in this instance for one among many    So when he had occasion to be seen  He was but as the cuckoo is in June  Heard not regarded seen but with such eyes  As sick and blunted with community  Afforded no extraordinary gaze  Such as is bent on sunlike majesty  When it shines seldom in admiring eyes  But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down  Slept in his face and rendered such aspect  As cloudy men use to their adversaries  Being with his presence glutted gorged and full  And in that very line Harry stand'st thou  For thou hast lost thy princely privilege  With vile participation not an eye  But is aweary of thy common sight  Save mine which hath desired to see thee more  Which now doth what I would not have it do  Make blind itself with foolish tenderness  Prince  I shall hereafter my most gracious lord  Be more myself  King  For all the world  As thou art at this hour was Richard then  When I from France set foot at Ravenspurg  And even as I was then is Percy now  Now by my sceptre and my soul to boot  He hath more worthy interest in the state  Than thou the shadow of succession  That is worth and the affections of the people are stronger pretensions to empire than hereditary title alone unsupported by virtue    For of no right nor colour like to right  He doth fill fields with  harness  Harness  Armour or coats of mail  in the realm  Turns head against the lion's armed jaws  And being no more in debt to years than thou  Leads antient lords and reverend bishops on  To bloody battles and to bruising arms  What neverdying honour hath he got  Against renowned Dowglas whose high deeds  Whose hot incursions and great name in arms  Hold from all soldiers chief majority  And military title capital  Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ  Thrice hath this Hotspur Mars in swathing cloaths  This infant warrior in his enterprizes  Discomfited great Dowglas ta'en him once  Enlarged him and made a friend of him  To fill the mouth of deep defiance up  And shake the peace and safety of our throne  And what say you to this Percy Northumberland  Th' Archbishop's Grace of York Dowglas and Mortimer  Confederate against us and are up  But wherefore do I tell this news to thee  Why Harry do I tell thee of my foes  Which art my nearest  Dearest  for most fatal  and dearest enemy  Thou that art like enough thro' vassal fear  Base inclination or the start of  spleen  Spleen  Shakespeare uses this word in a sense peculiar to himself for  sudden hasty  and  rash  In the Midsummer Night's Dream he applies it to lightning  Brief as the  lightning  in the collied night  That in a  spleen  unfolds both heaven and earth    To fight against me under Percy's pay  To dog his heels and curtsie at his frown  To shew how much thou art degenerate  Prince  Do not think soYou shall not find it so  And heaven forgive them that so much have swayed  Your majesty's good thoughts away from me  I will redeem all this on Percy's head  And in the closing of some glorious day  Be bold to tell you that I am your son  When I will wear a garment all of blood  And stain my favours in a bloody mask  Which washed away shall scower my shame with it  And that shall be the day when e'er it lights  That this same child of honour and renown  This gallant Hotspur this all praised knight  And your unthought of Harry chance to meet  For every honour sitting on his helm  'Would they were multitudes and on my head  My shames redoubled for the time will come  That I shall make this northern youth exchange  His glorious deeds for my indignities  Percy is but my factor good my lord  To engross up glorious acts on my behalf  And I will call him to so strict account  That he shall render every glory up  Yea even the slightest worship of his time  Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart  This in the name of heaven I promise here  The which if I perform and do survive  I do beseech your majesty may salve  The longgrown wounds of my intemperance  If not the end of life cancels all bonds  And I will die an hundred thousand deaths  Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow  King  An hundred thousand rebels die in this  Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein  Our hands are full of businessLet's away  Advantage feeds him fat while men delay  There is hardly a line in the above speech of the King that is not worth the whole of what Sophocles  makes Oedipus say to his son in the same circumstances But I don't expect that  the learned  will ever give up this point to me  while one passage remains in Greek and the other only in English    SCENE I  The nobleness of Hotspur's character is admirably sustained throughout this Play The following speech shews a fine part of it  Hotspur  to  Dowglas  Well said my noble Scot If speaking truth  In this fine age were not thought flattery  Such attribution should the Dowglas have  As not a soldier of this season's stamp  Should go so general current through the world  By heaven I cannot flatter I defy  The tongues of soothers but a braver place  In my heart's love hath no man than yourself  Nay task me to my word approve me lord  The precarious and critical situation of unwarrantable and hazardous undertakings is well reflected upon in the following passage of the same Scene when the conspirators are informed that Northumberland is prevented by sickness from attending the rendezvous  Worcester  to  Hotspur  But yet I would your father had been here  The quality and  hair  of our attempt  Brooks no  division  The quality and  hair  of our attempt  Books no  division    The Commentator by the word  hair  in this place understands  complexion or character  and finds fault with the harshness of the metaphor But I think from the last part of the sentence that the Poet meant the expression literally Worcester compares the stightness of their cause to a single  hair  which is a thing of too subtile a nature to bear being  divided    it will be thought  By some that know not why he is away  That wisdom loyalty and meer dislike  Of our proceedings kept the Earl from hence  And think how such an apprehension  May turn the tide of fearful faction  And breed a kind of question in our cause  For well you know we of the offending side  Must keep aloof from strict arbitrament  And stop all sightholes every loop from whence  The eye of reason may pry in upon us  This absence of your father draws a curtain  That shews the ignorant a kind of fear  Before not dreamt upon  The gallant spirit of Hotspur is well shewn in his reply  You strain too far  I rather of his absence make this use  It lends a lustre and more great opinion  A larger dare to our great enterprize  Than if the earl were here for men must think  If we without his help can make a head  To push against the kingdom with his aid  We shall o'erturn it topsyturvy down  Yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole  Upon this occasion Dowglas makes a boast which though intended by him as an exclusive compliment to his own nation may be challenged as the general characteristic of Great Britain at large  Dowglas in continuation of Hotspur's speech  As heart can thinkthere is not such a word  Spoke of in Scotland as this term of  fear    ACT V  SCENE I  Upon a parley or convention held between the chiefs of the two parties Worcester enumerates the several grievances of the nation that had induced the Percy family to rise in arms for redress In reply to these charges the King gives a very just account of the nature pretences and artifices of rebellion  King  These things indeed you have articulated  Proclaimed at marketcrosses read in churches  To face the garment of rebellion  With some fine colour that may please the eye  Of fickle changelings and poor discontents  Which gape and rub the elbow at the news  Of hurlyburly innovation  And never yet did insurrection want  Such watercolours to impaint its cause  Nor moody beggars starving for a time  Of pellmell havock and confusion  The liberal mind and brave heart of the Prince of Wales are beautifully marked in the following speech where he makes a generous encomium on Hotspur and sends him a spirited defiance to single combat at the same time  Prince  to  Worcester  In both our armies there is many a soul  Shall pay full dearly for this bold encounter  If once they join in trial Tell your nephew  The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world  In praise of Henry Percy By my hopes  This present enterprize set off his head  I do not think a braver gentleman  More activevaliant or more valiantyoung  More daring or more bold is now alive  To grace this latter age with noble deed  For my part I may speak it to my shame  I have a truant been to chivalry  And so I hear he doth account me too  Yet this before my father's majesty  I am content that he shall take the odds  Of his great name and estimation  And will to save the blood on either side  Try fortune with him in a single fight  SCENE II  The arguments of cowardice are whimsically discussed and exposed in the following passage The Prince just as he goes out says to Falstaff  Why thou owest Heaven a death  Upon which the fat Knight takes occasion to hold this humorous soliloquy with himself  Falstaff  'Tis not due yetI would be loath to pay him before his day What need I be so forward with him that calls not on me Well 'tis no matter honour pricks me on but how if honour pricks me off again when I come on Can honour set to a leg NoOr an arm NoOr take away the grief of a wound No Honour hath no skill in surgery then No What is honour A wordWhat is that word Honour AirA trim  reckoningWho hath it He that died on Wednesday Doth he feel it NoDoth he hear it NoIs it insensible then Yea to the deadBut will it not live with the living NoWhy Detraction will not suffer it Therefore I'll none of itHonour is but a meer  scutcheon  The  hatchment  placed over the door of a person deceased  and so ends my catechism  SCENE III  When the King has made the proffer of a general amnesty to the conspirators the natural distrust and diffidence which rebels must ever labour under is well descanted upon in this Scene  Worcester  It is not possible it cannot be  The king should keep his word in loving us  He will suspect us still and find a time  To punish this offence in other faults  Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes  For treason is but trusted like a fox  Who ne'er so tame so cherished and locked up  Will have a wild trick of his ancestors  Look how we can or sad or merrily  Interpretation will misquote our looks  And we shall feed like oxen at a stall  The better cherished still the nearer death  If the Reader will take the trouble to revert to the last observation on the fourth Scene in the First Act of this Play he will meet with a like reflection there made by the same person This repetition is a stroke of Nature given us by the Poet to shew the perturbation of spirits and distrust of mind which persons in his situation are ever sensible of But indeed this reflection may more generally be applied to every species of vice for in guilt there can be no peace within nor confidence without  SCENE IX  The magnanimity of the Prince of Wales is preserved throughout his character After he has slain Hotspur he makes his elegy in these words  Prince  Brave PercyFare thee well great heart  Illweaved ambition  A metaphor taken from cloth which  shrinks  when it is woven with too loose a contexture Johnson  how much art thou shrunk  When that this body did contain a spirit  A kingdom for it was too small a bound  But now two paces of the vilest earth  Is room enough This earth that bears thee dead  Bea  s not alive so stout a gentleman  If thou wert sensible of courtesy  I should not make so great a shew of zeal  But let my favour hide thy mangled form  And even in thy behalf I thank myself  For doing these fair rites of tenderness  Throwing his scarf over him  Adieu and take thy praise with thee to heaven  Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave  But not remembered in thy epitaph  POSTSCRIPT  I thought that my task was done with this Play when I had got to the end of it but there is something so very great singular and attractive in the two principal characters of this historic piece that I find a pleasure in keeping them still in view and contemplating them both in my mind  Whenever Hotspur or the Prince  filled the Scene  which they are either of them singly sufficient to do I confess that my heart was sensible of such an emotion as Sir Philip Sidney said he used to be affected with on a perusal of the old Ballad of ChevyChase  as if he had heard the sound of a trumpet  Perhaps the following observation may better account for my impulse  Women are apt to esteem the  antient virtue  of courage at an higher rate than men in general are and this for these two especial reasons The first that it is peculiarly necessary to their personal defence and the next that their weakness induces them to form a sublimer notion of this quality than the stronger and therefore braver sex may naturally be supposed to compliment it with Men feeling the principles of it in their own breasts conceive no very supernatural idea of it while  women having no such premisses to reason from look on it as something more than human  These reflections with the frequent occasions I have had thoughout this Play of comparing the two heroes of it with each other have tempted me to undertake a Parallel between them after the manner of Plutarch which however I did not mean to have given the Reader as hinted above 'till I should come to the end of the second Play after this where our Author has concluded all he had to say about Henry the Fifth  But as Shakespeare has opened enough of this Prince's character here to supply sufficient materials for the comparison and that his unfortunate rival is just slain I thought the Parallel might have a better effect on the mind of my Readers in this place than it would be likely to produce after the delay had suffered the impression of Hotspur's qualities to wear out of their remembrance  A PARALLEL BETWEEN HOTSPUR AND HENRY PRINCE OF WALES  THEY are both equally brave but the courage of Hotspur has a greater portion of fierceness in it The Prince's magnanimity is more heroic The first resembles Achilles the latter is more like Hector The different principles too of their actions help to form and justify this distinction as the one  invades  and the other  defends  a right Hotspur speaks nobly of his rival Dowglas to his face but after he is become his friend the Prince does the same of Hotspur behind his back and while he is still his enemy  They both of them possess a sportive vein of humour in their scenes of common life but Hotspur still preserves the surly and refractory haughtiness of his character throughout even in the relaxations  he indulges himself in The Prince has more of ease and nature in his delivering himself over to mirth and dissipation without reserve Hotspur's festivity seems to resemble that of Hamlet as assumed merely to relieve anxiety of mind and cover sanguinary purposes the Prince's gaiety like that of Faulconbridge  In King John  appears to be more genuine arising from natural temper and an healthful flow of spirits The Prince is AlcibiadesPercy ishimself  There is likewise another character in this rich Play of a most peculiar distinction as being not only  original  but  inimitable  alsoNo copy of it has ever since appeared either in life or description Any one of the Dramatis Personae in Congreve's Comedies or indeed in most of the modern ones might repeat the wit or humour of the separate parts with equal effect on the audience as the person to whose rôle they are appropriated but there is a certain characteristic peculiarity in all the humour of Falstaff that would sound flatly in the mouths of Bardolph Poins or Peto In fine the portrait of this extraordinary personage is delineated by so masterly a hand that we may venture to pronounce it to be the only one that ever afforded so high a degree of pleasure without the least pretence to merit or virtue to support it  I was obliged to pass by many of his strokes of humour character and description because they did not fall within the rule I had prescribed to myself in these notes but I honestly confess that it was with regret whenever I did so for were there as much moral as there certainly is physical good in laughing I might have transcribed every Scene of his throughout this the following Play and the Merry Wives of Windsor for the advantage of the health as well as the entertainment of my readers  HENRY the FOURTH

species of that kind of foreboding often unaccountably arising in the mind which I have taken notice of in former places  Richard II Act II Scene V and Merchant of Venice Act I Scene I First remark    Northumberland  Lord  Bardolph  and  Morton  Morton giving an account of the action at Shrewsbury says to Northumberland  Dowglas is living and your brother yet  But for my lord your son  Here Northumberland hastily interrupts him  Why he is dead  See what a ready tongue suspicion hath  He that but fears the thing he would not know  Hath by instinct knowledge from other's eyes  That what he feared is chanced  Bardolph  Yet for all this say not that Percy's dead  Northumberland  to  Morton  I see a strange confession in thine eye  Thou shak'st thy head and hold'st it fear or sin  To speak a truth If he be slain say so  The tongue offends not that reports his death  And he doth sin that doth belie the dead  Not he that saith the dead is not alive  Morton  Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news  Hath but a losing office and his tongue  Sounds ever after as a sullen bell  Remembered tolling a departed  The word in the Text is  departing    friend  I was just going to observe upon the latter part of this dialogue when I happened to recollect that I had already taken notice of a parallel passage in my second remark on the First Scene of the Third Act of King John and to which I beg leave to refer my Reader  The human mind when roused by danger or inflamed with passion is capable of inspiring the brave heart with additional courage and of supplying new vigour to exhausted strength This admirable oeconomy in the human frame is contrived by nature as being necessary to selfdefence as well as in order to render injury the more difficult and hazardous to the offender  Northumberland  For this I shall have time enough to mourn  In poison there is physic and this news  That would had I been well have made me sick  Being  ck hath in some measure made me well  And as the wretch whose feverweakened joints  Like strengthless hinges buckle under life  Impatient of his fit breaks like a fire  Out of his keeper's arms even so my limbs  Weakened with grief being now enraged with grief  Are thrice themselves Hence therefore thou nice crutch  A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel  Must glove this handAnd hence thou sickly quoif  Thou art a guard too wanton  light  or  effeminate  for the head  Which princes flushed with conquest aim to hit  Now bind my brows with iron and approach  The rugged'st hour that time and spite dare bring  To frown upon the enraged Northumberland  Let heaven kiss earth now let not Nature's hand  Keep the wild flood confined let order die  And let this world no longer be a stage  To feed contention in a lingering act  But let one spirit of the firstborn Cain  Reign in all bosoms that each heart being set  On bloody courses the rude scene may end  And darkness be the burier of the dead  I have continued this speech for eight lines further than my preface to it required but I thought the whole spirit and language of it too fine to suffer it to be mangled by stopping short Besides this latter part of it shews that extravagance of despair and rage to which grief resentment and misfortune are apt to drive a person whose mind is not happily tempered by philosophy or restrained by religion  See the second remark with the passage it refers to in the First Scene of Act the Fourth of the preceding Play as it will save me the trouble of making a new observation here or of repeating the same again as applicable to the following speech  Morton  My lord your son had only but the corpse  But shadows and the shews of men to fight  For that same word  Rebellion  did divide  The action of their bodies from their souls  And they did fight with queasiness constrained  As men drink potions that their weapons only  Seemed on our side but for their spirits and souls  This word  Rebellion  it had froze them up  As fish are in a pond  SCENE VI  There is a most disgusting picture but a too historically just one given in this place of the unstable and fluctuating affections of the multitude No popularity can be permanent which is not earned by virtue and preserved by perseverance in it The Public is a WeatherCock it continues steady only while the wind remains so when that shifts the  vane  turns also  York  Let us on  And publish the occasion of our arms  The Commonwealth is sick of their own choice  Their overgreedy love hath surfeited  An habitation giddy and unsure  Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart  O thou fond Many with what loud applause  Did'st thou beat heaven with blessing Bolinbroke  Before he was what thou would'st have him be  And now being trimmed up in thine own desires  Thou beastly feeder art so full of him  That thou provokest thyself to cast him up  So so thou common dog didst thou disgorge  Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard  And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up  And howl'st to find it What trust is in these times  They that when Richard lived would have him die  Are now become enamoured of his grave  Thou that threw dust upon his goodly head  When through proud London he came sighing on  After the admired heels of Bolinbroke  Criest now O earth yield us that king again  And take thou this O thoughts of men accurst  Past and to come seem best things present worst  ACT II  SCENE IV  The extravagant and superstitious notions of the vulgar in former times with regard to kings and heroes though not really supposed in this Scene are however very humorously ridiculed in it  The  Prince  and  Poins  Prince  Trust me I am exceeding weary  Poins  And is it come to that I had thought that weariness durst not have attacked one of so high blood  Prince  It doth me though it discolours the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it Doth it not shew vilely in me now to desire small beer  Poins  Why a Prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition  Prince  Belike then my appetite was not princely got for in troth I do now remember the poor creature small beer But indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness What a disgrace is it in me now to remember thy name or to know thy face tomorrow or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast  Videlicet  these and those that were once the peachcoloured onesor to bear the inventory of thy shirts as one for use and another for superfluity  That common disposition of vaunting ourselves above others so natural to mankind that some writer  stiles it  a mint at every one's tongue's end to coin their own praise  is well marked in the latter part of this Scene But I shall commence the dialogue a little earlier than may be just necessary to this reference in order to treat my reader with a beautiful trait in the Prince's character who is made to preserve his virtue untainted in the midst of all his debauchery and dissipation  Poins being piqued at the Prince's having exposed the shabbiness of his wardrobe replies  Poins  How ill it follows after you have laboured so hard you should talk so idly Tell me how many good young princes would do so their fathers lying so sick as yours at this time is  Prince  Shall I tell thee one thing Poins  Poins  Yes and let it be an excellent good thing  Prince  It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine  Poins  Go to I stand the push of your one thing that you'll tell  Prince  Why I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad now my father is sick albeit I could tell thee as to one it pleases me for fault of a better to call my friend I could be sad and very sad indeed too  Poins  Very hardly upon such a subject  Prince  By this hand thou think'st me as far in the Devil's book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency Let the end try the man But I tell thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow  Poins  The reason  Prince  What would'st thou think of me if I should weep  Poins  I would think thee a most princely hypocrite  Prince  It would be every man's thought and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks Never a man's thought in the world keeps the roadway better than thine Every man would think me an hypocrite indeed And what excites your most worshipful thought to think so  Poins  Why because you have seemed so lewd and so much ingrafted to Falstaff  Prince  And to thee  Poins  Nay by this light I am well spoken of I can hear it with my own ears The worst they can say of me is that I am  a second brother and that I am  a proper fellow of my hands  This was an expression in those times for  a person forward in fighting    and those two things I confess I cannot help  The delicacy of the Prince's difficulty upon this occasion in not being able to manifest the concern he was really sensible of for his father's illness lest from the former complexion of his life and manners he might be suspected of insincerity in such professions must have a fine effect on the sentiment of a reader who is possessed of the least refinement of principle or virtue  A most useful lesson might be framed upon the very singular character of this amiable person The pattern is not perfect and thereforeshall I venture to say it the example is the better for that reason His manners are idle but his morals uncorrupt He suffers Falstaff to make as free with him as he pleases but breaks his head as Mrs Quickly tells us in a former Scene for his having thrown out a jest upon his father Young men may learn from him never to be guilty of more vice than the temptation to it might precipitate them into He connives at the robbery of his companions for the diversion of playing the same game upon them again but resolves to make ample restitution for the wrong  See the last Scene of Act II in the first part of this Play  He offends his father by the dissoluteness of his conduct but his filial affection and respect are still unremitted towards him He shews a spirit of justice in injustice and of duty even in disobedience  I here offer this comment as a supplement to the character I have already drawn of this Prince at the end of the former Play I could not have fairly added it there as any thing that did not immediately relate to the comparison between him and Hotspur would have been improperly introduced in the Parallel  SCENE V  The vanity with which men are apt to plume themselves with regard to titles of honour to which they can claim no merit in themselves is humorously ridiculed here by Poins in his notes on Falstaff's letter to the Prince which is given him to read  Poins  reading    John Falstaff Knight  Every man must know that as often as he hath occasion to name himself even like those that are akin to the king for they never prick their finger but they cry  there is some of the king's blood spiltHow comes that  says he that takes upon him not to conceive it The answer is as ready as a borrower's cap  Always  cap in hand  to his creditor    I am the king's poor cousin Sir    Prince  Nay they will be akin to us or they will fetch it from  Japhet    SCENE VI  The servile adulation usually paid to great or distinguished persons even to an imitation of their very defects and which Alexander properly reprehended by giving a box on the ear to one of his courtiers who had mimicked the wryness of his neck is well represented here  Lady Percy speaking of Hotspur  He was indeed the glass  Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves  He had no legs that practised not his gait  And speaking thick  Might we not venture to substitute the word  quick  in this passage as being better opposed to the description in the second line following of  low and tardily  Those who speak  quick  generally speak  loud  also which compleats the opposition  which nature made his blemish  Became the accents of the wouldbe valiant  For those that could speak low and tardily  Would turn their own perfection to abuse  To seem like him So that in speech and gait  In diet in affections of delight  In military rules humours of blood  He was the mark and glass copy and book  That fashioned others  In the last passage of this Scene the uncertain and irresolute deliberation of mind in which men are apt to be held in suspence upon the crisis of doubtful adventures is well described by an apt simile  Northumberland  'Tis with my mind  As with the tide swelled up unto its height  That makes a still stand running neither way  Fain would I go to meet the archbishop  Y  then up in arms on his side    But many thousand reasons hold me back  I will resolve for Scotland there am I  'Till time and 'vantage crave my company  SCENE X  In this Scene Doll makes a speech that is worthy to be remarked upon When Pistol is stiled  captain  she says  Captain thou abominable damned cheater art thou not ashamed to be called captain If captains were of my mind they would truncheon you out of taking their names upon you before you have earned them A captain these villains will make the word captain odicustherefore captains had need look to it  There is a punctilio of the kind hinted at here already established in the Army but it is confined only to one article namely courage If an officer declines a challenge or suffers an affront to pass unresented his corps refuse  to roll  with him It would be better if this po  nt of honour respected the  moral  as well as the  natural  part of a soldier's character and better still if the same spirit and virtue were exerted in every class or distinction of life among lords commoners lawyers parsons and physicians A rule of this sort would go further towards the reformation of manners than all the laws and preachments that ever were made  SCENE XI  The sl  ght merits and superficial accomplishments which too often connect young persons in fellowship with each other are here well exposed When Fortune  is whirling her wheel about the turning of a tobaccostopper or of a straw may  make a man  according to Trinculo's expression  In the Tempest    Falstaff  and  Doll Tearsheet  Doll  Sirrah what humour is the prince of  Falstaff  A good shallow young fellow he would have made a good pantler he would have chipped bread well  Doll  They say Poins has a good wit  Falstaff  He a good wit hang him baboon His wit is as thick as Tewksbury mustard There is no more conceit in him than is in a mallet  Doll  Why does the prince love him so then  Falstaff  Because their legs are both of a bigness and he plays at quoits well and eats conger and fennel  As I know of no story that this circumstance can be applied to it may be supposed to allude to the particular taste for 'tis far from a general one of the Prince which Poins might have adopted as lady Percy says the flatterers of Hotspur affected him even in  his diet  From which hint I should think that  a senneleater  would be a better expression for  fawners  than  toad eater  because the authority of the phrase is better as being vouched by this passage  and drinks off candles ends for flapdragons  This article I can only explain by another boyish trick called  making fireships  An almond is lighted put into a glass of any liquor and swallowed down before the flame is extinguished  and rides the wild mare with the boys and jumps over joint stools and swears with a good grace and wears his boot very smooth like the sign of the leg and breeds no bate with telling of indiscreet stories and such other gambol faculties he hath that shew a weak mind and an able body for the which the prince admits him for he is himself such another the weight of an hair would turn the scales between their  avoirdupois    ACT III  SCENE I  In the fine speech which fills this Scene the anxieties of the  great  with the content of the  commonalty  the difference between the labour of the mind and that of the body are beautifullly contrasted and most poetically compared  The  King  alone in his nightgown  How many thousands of my poorest subjects  Are at this hour asleep O gentle sleep  Nature's soft nurse how have I frighted thee  That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down  And steep my senses in forgetfulness  Why rather sleep liest thou in smoky cribs  Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee  And hushed with buzzing nightflies to thy slumber  Than in the perfumed chambers of the great  Under the canopies of costly state  And lulled with sounds of sweetest melody  O thou dull god why liest thou with the vile  In loathsome beds and leav'st the kingly couch  A watchcase  A sentrybox to which was fixed an alarum bell that the sentinel was to ring in order to give notice of any attack on his post  or a common larumbeil  Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast  Seal up the shipboy's eyes and rock his brains  In cradle of the rude imperious surge  And in the visitation of the winds  Who take the ruffian billows by the top  Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them  With deaf'ning clamours in the slippery shrouds  That with the hurley death itself awakes  Canst thou O partial sleep give thy repose  To the wet seaboy in an hour so rude  And in the calmest and the stillest night  With all appliances and means to boot  Deny it to a king Then happy lowly clown  Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown  SCENE II  There is a sad because a too true prospect of human life presented to us here which justifies the goodness of Providence  "And vindicates the ways of God to man"  in hiding the future from our view  Quid sit futurum cras fuge quaerere  All the knowledge that is necessary to true wisdom the intire volume of morality and devotion lies open before us the contingencies of events only of little import upon the whole of our existence being veiled from our sight  Heaven from all creatures hides the book of fate  All but the page prescrib'd their  present state    From brutes what men from men what spirits know  Or who could  suffer being  here below  Pope's Essay on Man  Were we capable of foreseeing effects in their causes and admitted to peer through the  telescope of  time  it would more frequently and generally make us unhappy before our sufferings would render the future and precarious evil present and certain dull the sense of anticipated good by giving us enjoyment before possession hope the enhancer of expected bliss would be lost in assurance and that dear cordial of despair be then struck off from the  materia medica  of affliction  Cicero speaks finely upon this subject I forget the place but 'tis where he supposes Priam Pompey and Caesar to have had their several pages in the book of Fate laid open before them in the height of their prosperity  The  King Warwick  and  Surry  King  Oh Heaven that one might read the book of Fate  And see the revolution of the times  Make mountains level and the continent  Weary of solid firmness melt itself  Into the sea and other times to see  The beachy girdle of the ocean  Too wide for Neptune's hips How chances mock  And changes fill the cup of alteration  With divers liquors O if this were seen  The happiest youth viewing his progress through  What perils  pressed  The word is  past  in the text about which the Commentators raise a difficulty but don't remove it I hope that this mere verbal alteration will obviate the objection and supposing it to have been spelt  prest  in the original manuscript the transcriber might easily have made the mistake  what crosses to ensue  Would shut the book and sit him down and die  'Tis not ten years gone  Since Richard and Northumberland great friends  Did feast together and in two years after  Were they at wars It is but eight years since  This Percy was the man nearest my soul  Who like a brother toiled in my affairs  And laid his love and life under my foot  Yea for my sake even to the eyes of Richard  Gave him defiance But which of you was by  You cousin Nevil as I may remember  To Warwick  When Richard with his eye brimful of tears  This line is very affecting Shakespeare's humanity prompted him to make this unfortunate prince appear an object of compassion even where he is not exhibited in the scene by describing a circumstance that was no otherwise necessary to this passage    Then checked and rated by Northumberland  Did speak these words now proved a prophecy  "  Northumberland  thou ladder by the which  "My cousin  Bolinbroke  ascends my throne"  Though then Heaven knows I had no such intent  But that necessity so bowed the state  That I and greatness were compelled to kiss  This is sometimes the case but always the pretence for usurpation    "  The time will come  " thus did he follow it  "The time will come that foul sin gathering head  "Shall break into corruption"  so went on  Foretelling this same time's condition  And the division of our amity  However the reply to this reflection says very justly That in many cases the ignorance of the future may be often supplied by those who have made proper observations on past experience and are capable of forming judgments upon character  Warwick  There is an history in all men's lives  Figuring the nature of the times deceased  The which observed a man may prophecy  With a near aim of the main chance of things  As not yet come to life which in their seeds  And weak beginnings lie intreasured  Such things become the hatch and brood of time  And by the necessary form of them  King  Richard  might create a perfect guess  That great  Northumberland  then false to him  Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness  Which should not find a ground to root upon  Unless on you  SCENE III  The usual prate or as Hotspur phrases it  the bald unjointed chat  of old fellows among their cotemporaries the fond and vain boastings of their youthful frolics and their trite reflections intermixed at the same time with a particular attention to their own interests are all most excellently well displayed in this Scene which I have a double purpose in laying before the Reader to warn the old from rendering themselves tedious or ridiculous by such foibles and also to incline the young to shew some tenderness to natural weaknesses arising not from the peculiarities  of the persons being characteristical only of respectful years and  timehonoured  age  This is an epithet of Shakespeare's own framing Richard II Act I Scene I    Shallow  and  Silence  two Justices meeting  Shallow  Come on come on come on give me your hand Sir an early stirrer by the  rood  The  cross    And how doth my good cousin  Silence    Silence  Good morrow good cousin  Shallow    Shallow  And how doth my cousin your bedfellow and your fairest daughter and mine my goddaughter  Ellen  Silence  Alas a black  ousel  Ousel  is a blackbird but why he calls her so I can't tell unless it be in opposition to Shallow's complimenting her with the epithet of  fair    cousin  Shallow    Shallow  By yea and nay Sir I dare say my cousin  William  is become a good scholar He is at Oxford still is he not  Silence  Indeed Sir to my cost  Shallow  He must then to the  Inns of Court  shortly I was once of  Clement's Inn  where I think they will talk of  mad Shallow  yet  Silence  You were called  lusty  Shallow then cousin  Shallow  I was called any thing and I would have done any thing indeed too and roundly too There was I and little  John Doit  of  Staffordshire  and black  George Barc  and  Francis Pickbone  and  Will Squelt  a  Cotswold man  you had not four such swingebucklers  Swinge buckler  This is the only place where we meet with this epithet for a rioter or bully or indeed for any thing else in all other authors before or since that aera the word used for this purpose is  swash  buckler and properly so for the first part of the compound where the character lies is fully described by the expression of  swash  upon Shakespeare's own authority having severally applied it in such a sense in other places to  swash  a  swasher  for to  swagger  a  sw  ggerer  but  swinge  so far from supplying the meaning here intended conveys no sort of idea at all that I can conceive The expression of  swash  buckler is made use of applied to the Prince of Wales by Hotspur in the fourth Scene of Act I first part of this Play  in all the  Inns of Court  again and I may say to you we knew where the  bonaroba's  were and had the best of them all at commandment Then was  Jack Falstaff  now  Sir John  a boy and page to  Thomas Mowbray  duke of  Norfolk    Silence  This  Sir John  cousin that comes hither anon about soldiers  Shallow  The same  Sir John  the very same I saw him break  Schoggan  's head at the court gate when he was a crack not thus high and the very same day did I fight with one  Sampson Stockfish  a fruiterer behind  Gray's Inn  O the mad days that I have spent And to see how many of my old acquaintance are dead  Silence  We shall all follow cousin  Shallow  Certain 'tis certain very sure very sure Death as the Psalmist says is certain to all all

seeHe drew a good bowAnd dead He shot a fine shoot  John of Gaunt  loved him well and betted much money on his head DeadHe would have clapt in the clowt at twelve score and carried you a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen and a half  Terms of art in the exercise of the bow and arrow not worth explaining  that it would have done a man's heart good to see How a score of ewes now  Silence  Thereafter as they be A score of good ewes may be worth ten pounds  Shallow  And is old Double dead  SCENE IV  The ridicule in the following passage is directed against the affectation of using what the vulgar call  hard words  in familiar conversation with the synonimous explications of ignorance by throwing the same word into different tenses or cases as if the sense of it could be hit off by the repetition of its own sound  Bardolph  and  Shallow  Bardolph  My captain Sir commends him to you my captain  Sir John Falstaff  a tall gentleman by Heaven and a most gallant leader  Shallow  He greets me well Sir I knew him a good backsword man How doth the good knight May I ask how my good lady his wife doth  Bardolph  Sir pardon a soldier is better accommodated than with a wife  Shallow  It is well said Sir and it is well said indeed too  better accomm  dated  It is good yea indeed is itGood phrases surely are and ever were very commendable  Accommodated  It comes of  accommodo  very good a good phrase  Bardolph  Pardon me Sir I have heard the  word Phrase  call you it By this day I know not the  phrase  but I will maintain the  word  with my sword to be a soldierlike word and a word of exceeding  good command  Accommodated  that is when a man is as they say  accommodated  or when a man is being whereby he may be thought to be  accommodated  which is an excellent thing  ACT IV  SCENE VIII  There is a striking description given of the Prince here which does honour likewise to the speaker Parents in general while they are fond of their children are apt either to see them without blemish or when they are offended with them to shew no indulgence to their failings But the good old king speaks here impartially of his son fairly balancing his merits with his blames and weighing them with the charity that Heaven itself will do hereafter  The  King  Duke of  Clarence  and  Warwick  King  Thomas of Clarence  How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother  He loves thee and thou dost neglect him  Thomas    Thou hast a better place in his affection  Than all thy brothers cherish it my boy  And noble offices thou may'st effect  Of mediation after I am dead  Between his greatness and thy other brethren  Therefore omit him not blunt not his love  Nor lose the good advantage of his grace  By seeming cold or careless of his will  For he is gracious if he be observed  He hath a tear for pity and a hand  Open as day for melting charity  Yet notwithstanding being incensed he's flint  As humorous as winter and as sudden  As flaws  Air congealed by the coldness of the night and exploded in gusts by the warmth of the morning sun  congealed in the spring of day  His temper therefore must be well observed  Chide him for faults but do it reverently  When you perceive his blood inclined to mirth  But being moody give him line and scope  Till that his passions like a whale on ground  Confound themselves with working Learn this  Thomas    And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends  A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in  That the united vessel of their blood  Mingled with venom of suggestion  As forceperforce the age will pour it in  Shall never leak though it should work as strong  As  acc  itum  or rash gunpowder  One cannot help loving such a character taking the whole together The good part of it is its  nature  the bad one but its  youth  Fruits of a wild favour are the choicest when well cultivated  In part of the above speech there is a good direction given to those who have to deal with passionate or capricious persons  Chide him for faults  c  I should have expatiated on the unanimity of the royal family recommended here as necessary to the safety of the crown but that I could not possibly have urged any new argument on the subject stronger than the old simile of the  bundle of twigs  in the Fable  Just after the king speaks again of the prince with the same tenderness and in a most affecting manner upon hearing that he still continues to associate with his loose companions  King  Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds  And he the noble image of my youth  Is o  read with them therefore my grief  Stretches itself beyond the hour of death  In answer to this melancholy prospect Warwick endeavours to make an apology for the prince in a very pretty and ingenious allusion wherein is implied what happens to have too much truth in it that no one can know the world or be fit to govern in it who is not sufficiently acquainted with the base and corrupt part of mankind  Warwick  My gracious lord you look beyond him quite  The prince but studies his companions  Like a strange tongue wherein to gain the language  'Tis needful that the most immodest word  Be looked upon and le  rned which once attained  Your highn  ss knows comes to no farther use  But to be known and hated So like gross terms  The prince will in the perfectness of time  Cast off his followers and their memory  Shall as a pattern or a measure live  By which his grace must mete the lives of others  Turning past evils to advantages  To this piece of soothing flattery the king replies with as apt a simile on his part to express his diffidence in the hopeful prophecy  King  'Tis seldom when the bee forsakes her comb  In the dead carrion  Intimating that our affections like the honeycomb however improperly placed at first will too naturally continue still to attract us even in spite of our b  tter reason The simile here made use of tho' it may appear somewhat too coarse at first thought will quickly be found to contain a very poetical beauty in it upon recollecting the episode of  Aristaeus  at the end of the Fourth  Georgic  where the miraculous generation of bees from the putrid carcase of an ox is related by Virgil and to which this image may be looked upon as an allusion  SCENE IX  There is a reflection made here upon the unsatisfactory or perverse state of things in this life which will have double its effect as being delivered from that so much  falsely envied state  a throne  Upon hearing that the rebels had been overthrown the king says  And wherefore should these good news make me sick  Will fortune never come with both hands full  But write her fair words still in foulest letters  She either gives a stomach and no food  Such are the poor in health or else a feast  And takes away the stomach such the rich  Who have abundance and enjoy it not  SCENE X  The prince sitting by his dying father in a slumber with the crown lying by him lays open the scene and exposes to view the real or as it may more properly be expressed  the private state of greatness  in the following soliloquy  Prince  Why doth the crown lye there upon his pillow  Being so troublesome a bedfellow  O polished perturbation golden care  That keeps the ports of slumber open wide  To many a watchful night Sleep with it now  Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet  As he whose brow with homely biggen bound  Snores out the watch of night O majesty  When thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sit  Like a rich armour worn in heat of day  That s  s with safety By his gates of breath  Ther  s a down  feather which stirs not  Did he  u  p  re that light and weighless down  Peri  e must mo  My gracious lord my father  This sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep  That from the golden  rigol  in i  common sense Here 'tis put for a  diadem    hath divorced  So many English kings Thy due from me  Is tears a  eavy sorrows of the blood  Which nature love and si  l tenderness  Shall O my father pay thee plenteously  I have continued this speech further than was merely necessary to the purpose for which it was introduced because I am fond of exhibiting my heroe in the best lights of his character  ACT V  SCENE I  There are some good observations made here on the powerful effects of the company we associate with over both our minds and manners and the truth is not the less serious or worthy of attention for being humorously urged or ridiculously expressed  Falstaff on Shallow's going out  If I were sawed into quantities I should make four dozen of such b  d  d h  rmitslaves as master  Shallow  It is a wonderful thing to see the  ble coherence of his men's spirits and hisThey by observing of him do bear themselves like foolish justices he by  versing w  th them is turned into a justicelike servingman Their sp  are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they stock together in consent like so many wild  If I had a suit to master  Shallow  I would humour his men  the imputation of being near their master if to his men I  carry with master  Shallow  that no man could better command  his servants It is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is c  ught as men take diseases one of another therefore  let men take heed of their company  I will devise matter enough out of this  Shallow  to keep prince  Henry  in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions which is four terms or two  actions  The humour here lies in calculating the time of a spendthrift by law  terms  or  actions  for debt  Johnson    and he shall laugh without  intervallums  The vacations between the  Terms    O it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad  Sad  for  serious  brow will do with a fellow that never had the ach in his shoulders O you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up  SCENE II  The following passage though long will not be found tedious and is so full of excellent matter for observation that it would be unpardonable to shorten it The particulars worthy of notice in it are already so strongly marked by the principal speakers themselves that it would be an useless and impertinent labour in me to point them out to the Reader  The prince of Wales now king with the dukes of Lancaster Gloucester Clarence and the Lord Chief Justice  Chief Justice  Heaven save your majesty  Henry  This new and gorgeous garment majesty  Sits not so easy on me as you think  Brothers you mix your sadness with some fear  This is the  English  not the  Turkish  court  The sultan puts all his brothers to death when he mounts the throne 'Tis said so at least    Not  Amurath  an  Amurath  succeeds  But  Harry Harry  Yet be sad good brothers  For to speak truth it very well becomes ye  Sorrow so royally in you appears  That I will deeply put the fashion on  And wear it in my heart Why then be sad  But entertain no more of it good brothers  Than a joint burden laid upon us all  For me by Heaven I bid you be assured  I'll be your father and your brother too  Let me but bear your love I'll bear your cares  Yet weep that  Harry  's dead Well so will I  But  Harry  lives that shall convert those tears  By number into hours of happiness  The Brothers  We hope no other from your majesty  Henry  You all look strangely on me and you most  Who are I think assured I love you not  To the Chief Justice  Chief Justice  I am assured if I be measured rightly  Your majesty hath no just cause to hate me  Henry  No might a prince of my great hopes forget  So great indignities you laid upon me  What rate rebuke and roughly send to prison  The immediate heir of England Was this easy  May this be washed in  Lethe  and forgotten  Chief Justice  I then did use the person of your father  The image of his power lay then in me  And in the administration of his law  While I was busy for the common weal  Your highness pleased to forget my place  The majesty and power of law and justice  The image of the king whom I presented  And struck me in my very seat of judgment  Whereon as an offender to your father  I gave bold sway to my authority  And did commit you  This is a  historic fact  If the deed were ill  Be you contented wearing now the garland  To have a son set your decrees at nought  To pluck down justice from your awful bench  To trip the course of law and blunt the sword  That guards the peace and safety of your person  Nay more to spurn at your most royal image  And mock your working in a second body  Question your royal thoughts make the case yours  Be now the father and propose a son  Hear your own dignity so much profaned  See your most sacred laws so loosely slighted  Behold yourself so by a son disdained  And then imagine me taking your part  And in your power so silencing your son  After this cold considerance sentence me  And as you are a king speak in your state  What I have done that misbecame my place  My person or my liege's sovereignty  Henry  You are right Justice and you weigh this well  Therefore still bear the ballance and the sword  And I do wish your honours may increase  Till you do live to see a son of mine  Offend you and obey you as I did  I should chuse to alter the line thusOffend  not but  obey you as I did    For which I do commit into your hand  The unstained sword that you have used to bear  With this remembrance that you use the same  With a like bold just and impartial spirit  As you have done 'gainst me There is my hand  You shall be as a father to my youth  My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear  And I will stoop and humble my intents  To your wellpractised wise directions  And princes all believe me I beseech ye  My father is gone  wild  Wild  The sense of the word in this place is obscure and the figure of speech necessary to explain it must be extended on the rack to confess its meaning But as the best way of studying an author is to make him a comment on himself by this rule we must suppose this expression to intend that the reality of his  wildness  an impression of which his father carried with him to the grave is as much buried there as his idea of it is The prince's  wildness  is spoken of in other places and is mentioned in such a manner as to support this explication  into his grave  For in his tomb lie my affections  Affections  Loose habits and dissipated manners    And with his spirit  sadly  Sadly  for soberly seriously or thoughtfully  I survive  To mock the expectations of the world  To frustrate prophecies and to raze out  Rotten opinion which hath set me down  After my seeming Though my tide of blood  Hath proudly flowed in vanity till now  Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea  Where it shall mingle with the state of floods  And flow henceforth in formal majesty  Now call we our high court of Parliament  And let us chuse such limbs of noble counsel  That the great body of our state may go  In equal rank with the bestgoverned nation  That war or peace or both at once may be  As things acquainted and familiar to us  In which you father shall have foremost hand  Our coronation done we will accite  As I before remembered all our state  And Heaven consigning to my good intents  No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say  Heaven shorten  Harry  's happy life one day  This judge's name was  Hankford  But the favourable event here described never happened with regard to him Shakespeare I suppose only introduced it by way of heightening our idea of the young king and in this light though the fact be false it may however according to the distinction of some moral writer be considered as a  secondary truth  because it corresponds with the character of the agent and  would probably have happened had the poor man lived to have appeared before him  But alas the inconsistencies of human nature This upright judge this brave man was struck with such a panic on the demise of  Henry the Fourth  that he instantly formed a scheme for destroying himself in the following manner He gave strict orders to his park keeper to shoot any person that should attempt to pass through his grounds without giving an account of his name and business In the middle of that night he put himself in the way refused to answer and was immediately killed according to the mad scheme of his pusillanimous purpose  SCENE VII  I shall close my remarks on this Play with the following noble speech of the young king in which his truly great and amiable character is finely wound up  Falstaff Pistol  and others    Falstaff  My king my Jove I speak to thee my heart  King  I know thee not old man fall to thy prayers  How ill white hairs become a fool and jester  I have long dreamed of such a kind of man  So surfeitswelled so old and so prophane  But being awake I do despise my dream  Make less thy body hence and more thy grace  Leave gormandizing Know the grave doth gape  For thee thrice wider than for other men  Reply not to me with a foolborn jest  Presume not that I am the thing I was  For Heaven doth know so shall the world perceive  That I have turned away my former self  So will I those that kept  it  company  When thou dost hear I am as I have been  Approach me and thou shalt be as thou wast  The tutor and the feeder of my riots  Till then I banish thee on pain of death  As I shall do the rest of my misleaders  Not to come near our person by ten miles  For competence of life I will allow you  That lack of means enforce you not to evil  And as we hear you do reform yourselves  We will according to your strength and qualities  Give you  cement  HENRY the FIFTH  Dramatis Personae  MEN  HENRY the Fifth  KING OF FRANCE  THE DAUPHIN  DUKE OF YORK Uncles to Henry  DUKE OF EXETER Uncles to Henry  DUKE OF BEDFORD

and WILLIAMS English Soldiers  WOMEN  ISABEL Queen of France  CATHARINE her Daughter  A LADY of the French Court  HENRY the FIFTH  ACT I  SCENE I  THE sudden reformation of Henry Prince of Wales upon his succession to the crown is a fact recorded in history and there have been sufficient instances of such an exertion of latent virtue in mankind upon record to evince its not being a thing unnatural though sad to say it not enough to prevent its being reckoned in the class of uncommon events Let us but lend our own assistance and grace will seldom be found wanting This extraordinary character is most beautifully described in the example now before us  Canterbury  and  Ely  discoursing about the King    Canterbury  The courses of his youth promised it not  The breath no sooner left his father's body  But that his  wildness  mortified in him  Seemed to die too yea at that very moment  Consideration like an angel came  And whipt the offending Adam out of him  Leaving his body as a paradise  To invelop and contain celestial spirits  What a beautiful and poetical allusion is here made to the circumstance of our first parents being exiled from Eden    Never came reformation in a flood  With such an heady current scowering faults  Alluding to Hercules turning the course of a river through the Augaean stables    Nor ever hydraheaded wilfulness  Shakespeare having hinted at one of the labours of Hercules a second immediately occurred and I should not have been surprized in the exuberance of his imagery if he had gone through the whole dozen if it was only for an opportunity of making this reflection that  a reformation from vice was an harder task than them all put together    So soon did lose his seat and all at once  As in this king  SCENE II  Here follows a fine lesson for states and potentates to reflect seriously upon when they are publishing manifestos or meditating a war  The King and Canterbury who was president of his council  Henry  My learned lord we pray you to proceed  And justly and religiously unfold  Why the law  Salic  that they have in France  Or should or should not bar us in our claim  And God forbid my dear and faithful lord  That you should fashion wrest or bow your reading  Or nicely charge your understanding soul  With opening titles miscreate whose right  Suits not in native colours with the truth  For God doth know how many now in health  Shall drop their blood in approbation  In approbation  In support of a cause he had pronounced to be just  Of what your reverence shall incite us to  Therefore take heed how you impawn your person  Pledge your character and conscience    How you awake the sleeping sword of war  We charge you in the name of God take heed  For never two such kingdoms did contend  Without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops  Are every one a woe a sore complaint  'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords  That make such waste in  brief mortality    Under this conjuration speak my lord  For we will hear note and believe in heart  That what you speak is in your conscience washed  As pure as sin with baptism  There is a just description of the nature of government given a good deal further in the same Scene  Canterbury  and  Ely  Ely  While that the armed hand doth fight abroad  The advised head defends itself at home  For government though high and low and lower  Put into parts doth keep in one consent  Congreeing in a full and natural close  Like music  Both the distinction and the simile here made use of are almost a literal translation of a parallel passage  in Cicero and there are so many other allusions of the same kind to be met with throughout our author's writings as might lead one into an opinion of his being a tolerable classical scholar notwithstanding Ben Johnson's invidious line  "Altho' thou hadst small Latin and less Greek"  But in denying him the accomplishment of literature he paid an higher compliment to his genius than perhaps he meant as this was to impute to him the greater merit of being possessed of the same fancy and judgment with the best of the Antients without the advantages of their example or instruction  The subject of the above speech is considered more at large and treated in detail in the deduction drawn from it in the reply  Canterbury  Therefore Heaven doth divide  The state of man in divers functions  Setting endeavour in continual motion  To which is fixed as an aim or butt  Obedience For so work the honeybees  Creatures that by a rule in nature teach  The art of order to a peopled kingdom  They have a king and officers of sort  Where some like magistrates correct at home  Others like merchants venture trade abroad  Others like soldiers armed in their stings  Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds  Which pillage they with merry march bring home  To the tentroyal of their emperor  Who busied in his majesty surveys  The singing mason building roofs of gold  The civil citizen kneading up the honey  The poor mechanic porters crowding in  Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate  The sadeyed justice with his surly hum  Delivering o'er to executors pale  The lazy yawning drone I thus inser  That many things having full reference  To one consent may work contrariously  As many arrows loosed several ways  Come to one mark as many ways meet in one town  As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea  As many lines close in the dial's center  So may a thousand actions once afoot  End in one purpose and be all well borne  Without defeat  SCENE III  When the ambassadors of France come before Henry they ask him whether they may speak their errand in express words or must be restrained to deliver the substance of it only in more covert terms To which he replies  Henry  We are no tyrant but a Christian king  Unto whose grace our passion is as subject  As are our wretches fettered in our prisons  Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness  Tell us the Dauphin's mind  The above speech is worth noting considering the maxim generally Resentment may be excusable in a man but is unpardonable in a king In this character he is to consider himself but as one of the states of government only and legislature is dispassionate Shall a judge suffer himself to be biassed by private pique when pronouncing a public sentence When power is made use of to revenge personal affronts royalty ceases and tyranny begins  ACT II  SCENE I  Chorus  O England model to thy inward greatness  Like little body with a mighty heart  What might'st thou do that honour would thee do  Were all thy children kind and natural  This is a reflection which cannot too frequently be made and should be the preamble to every act or deed of Kings Lords and Commons See the speech and reflection which concludes King John in this Work  SCENE III  If I had attended to the order of the subjects without regarding that of the Scenes I should have added the following passage to the last observation on the former Act and to which note I beg leave now to refer the Reader  The King on sentencing the conspirators Cambridge Scroop and Grey says  God quit you in his mercy Hear your sentence  You have conspired against our royal person  Joined with an enemy proclaimed and from his coffers  Received the golden earnest of our death  Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter  His princes and his peers to servitude  His subjects to oppression and contempt  And his whole kingdom into desolation  Touching our person seek we no revenge  But we our kingdom's safety must so tender  Whose ruin you three sought that to her laws  We do deliver you Go therefore hence  Poor miserable wretches  to your death  The taste whereof God of his mercy give  You patience to endure and true repentance  Of all your dear offences  SCENE V  The  King  of  France  and the  Dauphin  Dauphin  My most redoubted father  It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe  For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom  Though war and no known quarrel were in question  But that defences musters preparations  Should be maintained assembled and collected  As were a war in expectation  Therefore I say 'tis meet we all go forth  To view the sick and feeble parts of France  But let us do it with no shew of fear  No with no more than if we heard that England  Were busied with a Whitsun morrisdance  Such ought to be the vigilance of all states When sovereigns repose their heads supinely in the lap of peace they must expert to be taken napping at some unguarded hour or other The best way of making peace is with sword in hand they say Yesand to preserve it too  In the continuation of this Scene the same speaker adds another rule of prudence and safety to the former  Dauphin  In causes of defence 'tis best to weigh  The enemy more mighty than he seems  So the proportions of defence are filled  Which of a weak and niggardly projection  Doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting  And again the same subject is in some sort carried on with additional reflections  French King  You see this chase is hotly followed friends  Dauphin  Turn head and stop pursuit for coward dogs  Most spend their months  Open  or  ark  Huntsman's phrase  when what they seemed to threaten  Runs far before them Good my sovereign  Take up the English short and let them know  Of what a monarchy you are the head  Selflove my liege it not so vile a sin  As selfneglecting  SCENE VI  In the speech of the English Ambassador to the French King claiming the rights of Henry there are some truly alarming reflections proposed to the consideration of all states that undertake or maintain a war in an unjust cause and may be considered as a supplement to Henry's first speech in the former Act  Exeter  He bids you in the bowels of the Lord  Deliver up the crown and to take mercy  On the poor souls for whom this hungry war  Opens his vasty jaws upon your head  Turning the dead men's blood the widows' tears  The orphans' cries the pining maidens' groans  The Text is much improved by a transposition of the images in these two lines according to a note of Doctor Johnson's on the passage    For husbands fathers and betrothed lovers  That shall be swallowed in this controversy  ACT III  SCENE IV  The same subject and reflections are repeated here before the besieged gates of Harfleur  Henry  How yet resolves the governor of the town  This is the latest parle we will admit  Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves  Or like to men proud of destruction  Defy us to our worst As I'm a soldier  A name that in my thoughts becomes me best  If I begin the battery once again  I will not leave the halfachieved Harfleur  Till in her ashes the lie buried  The gates of mercy shall be all shut up  And the fleshed soldier rough and hard of heart  In liberty of bloody hand shall range  With conscience wide as hell mowing like grass  Your fresh fair virgins and your flowering infants  What is it then to me if impious war  Arrayed in flames like to the prince of fiends  Do with his smircht complexion all fell feats  Enlinked to waste and desolation  What is't to me when you yourselves are cause  If your pure maidens fall into the hand  Of hot and forcing violation  What rein can hold licentious Wickedness  When down the hill he holds his fierce career  We may as bootless spend our vain command  Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil  As send our precepts to th' Leviathan  To come ashore Therefore ye men of Harfleur  Take pity of your town and of your people  While yet my soldiers are in my command  While yet the cool and temperate wind of grace  Disperse  Disperse  The word in the Text is  o'er  low  The Commentator finds fault with the harshness of the metaphor but leaves it so I have ventured on this alteration and have put the verb into the potential mood to preserve the metre of the line  the filthy and contagious clouds  Of heady murder spoil and villainy  If not why in a moment look to see  The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand  Defile the locks of your shrillshrieking daughters  Your fathers taken by the silver beards  And their most reverend heads dashed to the walls  Your naked infants spitted upon pikes  While the mad mothers with their howls confused  Do break the clouds as did the wives of Jewry  At Herod's bloodyhunting slaughtermen  What say ye Will ye yield and this avoid  Or guilty in defence be thus destroyed  What an horrid representation is here given of the too general state of routed battle A civil war excited among all the wild beasts of the forest could not afford so shocking a picture No creature but  man joins cruelty with fierceness or adds malice to rage None but the  inhuman human  savage Man  The above description of a victorious enemy is too true a one if historic evidence can force reluctant creditFor war has its barbarous  rights  or  wrongs  ratherwhich neither humanity can prevent nor discipline restrain nor justice punishWar is its own legislator and victory to itself a law  "It is War's prize to take all 'vantages  Henry VI Third Part  "  SCENE VIII  After the surrender of Harfleur when Henry is on his march to Calais he is met by Mountjoy the French Herald who delivers an insolent defiance from the king of France requiring to know what ransom he will compound to pay for leave to retire alive out of the kingdom to which he replies  Thou dost thy office fairly Turn thee back  And tell thy king I do not seek him now  But could be willing to march on to Calais  Without impeachment for to say the  sooth  S  b  an old Saxon word for  truth      Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much  Unto an enemy of craft and vantage  My people are with sickness much enfeebled  My numbers lessened and those few I have  Almost no better than so many French  Who when they were in health I tell thee Herald  I thought upon one pair of English legs  Did march three FrenchmenYet forgive me God  That I do brag thus this your air of France  Hath blown that vice in me I must repent  Go therefore tell thy master here I am  My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk  My army but a weak and sickly guard  Yet God before tell him we will come on  Though France himself and such another neighbour  Stand in our way There's for thy labour Mountjoy  Go bid thy master well advise himself  If we may pass we will if we be hindered  We shall your tawny ground with your red blood  Discolour and so Mountjoy fare you well  The sum of all our answer is but this  We would not seek a battle as we are  Yet as we are we say we will not shun it  So tell your master  There is something extremely fine in Henry's reply to the French gasconading taunt above It is uncommon to meet with so much carelessness and courage in the same characterThere is no such description in history nor have many people probably ever been acquainted with it among the living manners of men and yet the representation of it appears to be so perfectly natural that we must greatly admire the talents of a writer who could thus realize in effect a mere idea  The bravery of Henry scorned to deny the condition of his troops either with regard to their health or numbers these circumstances the enemy pretended to have been acquainted with already or were determined to make an experiment of at least he therefore openly acknowledges the truth of his weak situation and this with the same ease and humour as he would have delivered himself to Falstaff had he been his aidducamp for the day  Upon his royal face there is no note  How dread an army have enrounded him  Chorus to Act IV    But at the same time he most resolutely declares his purpose of trying the event at every hazard of life claim and liberty  The contemptuous sarcasms he throws out in this speech against the French nation besides shewing an admirable temper and composure of mind in such difficult circumstances convey also an apt repartee to the scornful insolence of the Dauphin who in return to Henry's demanding his right of succession to the crown of France sent him a parcel of tennisballs to play with in allusion to the slight repute of his former life and manners Pertness is impertinence but repartee has the  lex talionis  or law of retaliation on its side  Shakespeare has a great resemblance to Ariosto whose stile had a mixture of humour with sublimity in it The late ingenious Mr Hawkins says of the latter  His heroes are full of merriment in the midst of danger and he seldom describes a battle without a jest  SCENE II  The same magnanimity of character in Henry is displayed throughout this Play One of the instances of it we may see in this Scene out of which also some other things worthy of notice may be picked up The Reader will mark them as he peruses  The English camp at  Agincourt  Henry  and  Gloucester  Henry  Glo'ster 'tis true that we are in great danger  The greater therefore should our courage be  Enter  Bedford  Goodmorrow brother BedfordGod Almighty  There is some soul of goodness in things evil  Would man observingly distil it out  For our bad neighbours make us early stirrers  Which is both healthful and good husbandry  Besides they are our outward consciences  And preachers to us all admonishing  That we should dress us fairly for our end  Thus may we gather honey from the weed  And make a moral of the Devil himself  Enter  Erpingham  Good morrow old Sir Thomas Erpingham  A good soft pillow for that good white head  Were better than a churlish turf of France  Erpingham  Not so my liege this lodging likes me better  Since I may say now lie I like a king  Henry  'Tis good for men to love their present pain  Upon example so the spirit is eased  And when the mind is quickened out of doubt  The organs though defunct and dead before  Break up their drowsy grave and newly move  With casted  s  ough  The skin of a snake the casting of which was thought formerly to renew its vigour  and fresh legerity  Lend me thy cloak Sir Thomas Brothers both  Commend me to the princes in our camp  Do my good morrow to them and anon  Desire them all to my pavilion  Gloucester  We shall my liege  Erpingham  Shall I attend your grace  Henry  No my good knight  Go with my brothers to my lords of England  I and my bosom must debate awhile  And then I would no other company  Erpingham  The Lord in heaven bless thee noble Harry  Henry  God amercy old heart thou speak'st chearfully  SCENE IV  And again his excellent composure of mind is manifested further in this Scene where he answers the challenges of the guards going their rounds but without revealing himself I shall here present the intire passage to the Reader referring as in the former instance the several parts of it which deserve observation to his own apprehension  Henry going out enter Bates and Williams two Soldiers  Williams  Who goes there  Henry  A friend  Williams  Under what Captain serve you  Henry  Under Sir Thomas Erpingham  Williams  A good old commander and a most kind gentleman I pray you what thinks he of our estate  Henry  Even as men wrecked upon a sand that look to be washed off the next tide  Bates  He hath not told his thought to the king  Henry  No nor is it meet he should for though I speak it to you I think the king is but a man as I amThe violet smells to him as it doth to me all his senses have but human conditions His ceremonies laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing therefore when he sees reason of fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by shewing it should dishearten his army  Bates  He may shew what outward courage he will but I believe as cold a night as 'tis he could wish himself in the Thames up to the neck and so I would he were and I by him at all adventures so we were quit here  Henry  By my troth I will speak my conscience of the king I think he would not with himself any where but where he is  Bates  Then would he were here alone so should he be sure to be ransomed and many poor men's lives saved  Henry  I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone however you speak this to feel other men's minds Methinks I could not die any where so contented as in the king's company his cause being just and his quarrel honourable  Williams  That's more than we know  Bates  Ay or more than we should seek after for we know enough if we know we are the king's subjects if his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us  Williams  But if the cause be not good the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in a battle shall join together at the latter day and cry all  we died at such a place  some swearing some crying for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them some upon the debts they owe some upon their children rawly left I am afeared there are few die well that fall in battle for how can they charitably dispose of any thing when blood is their argument Now if these men do not die well it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it whom to disobey were against all proportion of subjection  Henry  So if a son that is sent by his father about merchandize do fall into some lewd action and miscarry the imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon the father that sent him or if a servant under his master's command transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities you may call the business of the matter the author of the servant's damnation But this is not soThe king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their deaths when they purpose their services Besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitrament of swords can try it with all unspotted soldiers Some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery Now if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment  though they can cutstrip men they have no wings to fly from God  War is his beadle war is his vengeance so that herein men are punished for beforebreach of the king's law in the king's quarrel  nowWhere they feared death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish Then if they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for which they are now visited Every subject's duty is the king's but every subject's soul is his own Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every moth out of his conscience and dying so death is to him an advantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained and to him that escapes it were not sin to think that making God so free an offer he let him outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach others how they should prepare  Williams  'Tis certain that every man that dies ill the ill is upon his own head the king is not to answer for it  In the continuation of this Scene Williams quarrels with the king still unknown and they exchange gages with each other to fight on their next interview Henry does all this in sport and I should not have brought it forward to the Reader's view but that this particular is alluded to just now in the Sixteenth Scene of this Act  SCENE V  The following beautiful speech is replete with fine reflection rich language and poetical imagery It immediately follows the above dialogue when the soldiers quit the Scene and is a meditation naturally arising from the argument there discussed  Henry  solus    Upon the king  let us our lives our souls  Our debts our careful wives our children and  Our sins lay on the king he must bear all  O hard condition and twinborn with greatness  Subject to breath of every fool whose sense  No more can feel but his own wringing  What infinite heartease must kings neglect  That private men enjoy And what have kings  That private have not too save ceremony  Save general ceremony  And what art thou thou idol ceremony  What kind of God art thou that sufferest more  Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers  What are thy rents What are thy comings in  O ceremony shew me but thy worth  What is thy soul O adoration  Art thou aught else but place degree and form  Creating awe and fear in other men  Wherein thou art less happy being feared  Than they in fearing  What drink'st thou oft instead of homage sweet  But poisoned flattery O be sick great greatness  And bid thy ceremony give thee cure  Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out  With titles blown from adulation  Will it give place to flexure and low bending  Can'st thou wnen thou command'st the beggar's knee  Command the health of it No thou proud dream  That playest so subtly with a king's repose  I am a king that find thee and I know  'Tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball  The sword the mace the crown imperial  The entretissued robe of gold and pearl  The farsed  Farsed  signifies  puffed  or  tumid    title running 'fore the king  The throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp  That beats upon the high shore of this world  No not all these thricegorgeous ceremonies  Nor all these laid in bed majestical  Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave  Who with a body filled and vacant mind  Gets him to rest crammed with distressful bread  Never sees horrid night the child of hell  But like a lacquey from the rise to set  Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night  Sleeps in Elysium next day after dawn  Doth rise and help Hyperion  The morning star  to his horse  And follows so the everrunning year  With profitable labour to his grave  And  but for ceremony  such a wretch  Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep  Hath the forehand and vantage of a king  The slave a member of the country's peace  Enjoys it but in gross brain little wots  What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace  Whose hours the peasant best advantages  What is indeed the superior state of kings but greater pomp anxiety and danger  SCENE VI  Henry makes a good prayer here just before the engagement in the first part of which is expressed a proper theological sense in the referring all events to the disposition of Providence but in the latter end of it the Popish doctrine of  Commutation  the making atonement for misdeeds by pious acts without performing the justice of  Retribution  is fully set forth  Henry  O God of battles steel my soldiers hearts  Possess them not with fear take from them now  The sense of reckoning lest the opposed numbers  Pluck their hearts from themNot to day O Lord  O not to day think not upon the fault  My father made in compassing the crown  I Richard's body have interred new  And on it have bestowed more contrite tears  Than from it issued forced drops of blood  Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay  Who twice aday their withered hands hold up  Toward heaven to pardon blood and I have built  Two chauntries where the sad and solemn priests  Sing still for Richard's soul More will I do  Though all that I can do is nothing worth  Since that my penitence comes after all  Imploring pardon  SCENE VII  The brisk presumptuous and gasconading spirit of the French nation is well exposed in the following Scene laid in their camp just before the action  The  Dauphin Duke  of  Orleans Rambures  c  Orleans  The sun doth gild our armour up my lords  Dauphin  Montez cheval  My horse valet lacquey ha  Orleans  O brave spirit  Enter  Constable  Now my lord Constable  Constable  Hark how our steeds for present service neigh  Dauphin  Mount them and make incision in their sides  That their hot blood may spin in English eyes  And daunt them with superfluous courage Ha  Rambures  What will you have them weep our horses' bloo  How shall we then behold their natural tears  Enter a  Messenger  Messenger  The English are embattled you French peers  Constable  To horse ye gallant princes strait to horse  Do but behold yon poor and starved band  And your fair shew shall suck away their souls  Leaving them but the shales  Shale  corrupt English for  shell    and husks of men  There is not work enough for all our hands  Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins  To give each naked curtleax a stain  That our French gallants shall today draw out  And sheath for lack of sport Let's but blow on them  The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them  'Tis positive 'gainst all exception lords  That our superfluous lacqueys and our peasants  Who in unnecessary action swarm  About our squares of battle were enow  To purge this field of such a hilding  Hilding mean  or  contemptible    foe  Though we upon this mountain's basis by  Took stand for idle contemplation  But that our honours must not What's to say  A very little little let us do  And all is done Then let the trumpet sound  The  tucketsonance  and the note to mount  For our approach shall so much  dare the field    That England shall  couch down  in fear and yield  The words marked in Italics in these three last lines are borrowed from the sporting phrase particularly falconry to express a scorn of the English forces    Enter  Grandpree  Grandpree  Why do ye stay so long my lords of France  Yon island carrions desperate of their bones  Illfavouredly become the morning field  Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose  And our air shakes them passing scornfully  Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggared host  And faintly through a rusty bever peeps  The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks  With torchstaves in their hands and their poor jades  Lob down their heads dropping the hide and hips  The gum downroping from their pale dead eyes  And in their pale dull mouths the gimmalbit  A curb bridle  Lies foul with chewed grass still and motionless  And their executors the knavish crows  Fly o'er them all impatient for their hour  Description cannot suit itself in words  To demonstrate the life of such a battle  In life so liveless as it shews itself  Constable  They've said their prayers and they wait for death  Dauphin  Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits  And give their fasting horses provender  And after fight them  Grandpree's description given here of a fatigued dispirited and weatherbeaten host is most masterly drawn in the true picturesque stile in the above passage and if the French had fought on that memorable day but as well as Shakespeare has made them speak upon the occasion England might not perhaps have numbered France among the titles of its crown  SCENE VIII  The gallant spirit of a soldier is nobly set forth in this scene which were it founded merely in the imagination of the poet would not be so material to be remarked upon but being grounded on historic fact ought to be taken notice of for the honour of our English heroe  Henry  and  Westmorland  Westmorland  O that we now had here  But one ten thousand of those men in England  That do no work today  The battle of Agincourt was fought on St Crispian's day a great festival then observed in England    King  What's he that wishes so  My cousin Westmorland No my fair cousin  If we are marked to die we are enow  To do our country loss and if to live  The fewer men the greater share of honour  God's will I pray thee wish not one man more  By Jove I am not covetous of gold  Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost  It yerns me not if men my garments wear  Such outward things dwell not in my desires  But if it be a sin to covet honour  I am the most offending soul alive  No 'faith my lord wish not a man from England  God's peace I would not lose so great an honour  As one man more methinks would share from me  For the best hopes I have Don't wish one more  Rather proclaim it Westmorland through my host  That he who hath no stomach to this fight  Let him depart his passport shall be made  And crowns for convoy put into his purse  We would not die in that man's company  That fears his fellowship to die with us  This day is called the feast of Crispian  He that outlives this day and comes safe home  Will stand a tiptoe when this day is named  And rouse him at the name of Crispian  He that shall live this day and see old age  Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours  And say Tomorrow is Saint Crispian  Then will he strip his sleeve and shew his scars  Old men forget yet shall not all forget  But they'll remember with advantages  With  adva  tages  Magnifying their own prowess    What feats they did that day Then shall our names  Familiar in their mouths as houshold words  Harry the king Bedford and Exeter  Warwick and Talbot Salisbury and Glo'ster  Shakespeare seems to have made the king purposely leave the name of Westmorland out of this illustrious roll from a pique at his having wished for additional forces or more probably to preserve the chastity of historic enumeration as he had not distinguished himself in the action    Be in their flowing cups freshly remembered  This story shall the good man teach his son  And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by  From this day to the ending of the world  But we in it shall be remembered  We few we happy few we band of brothers  For he today that sheds his blood with me  Shall be my brother be he ne'er so vile  This day shall gentle his condition  And gentlemen in England now abed  Shall think themselves accursed they were not here  And hold their manhoods cheap while any speaks  That fought with us upon saint Crispian's day  The latter part of this speech though somewhat too declamatory contains many of those reflections  and considerations which used  formerly  to inspire our troops with courage while that virtuous and noble spirit was yet retained among our brave ancestors which led them to respect what their country or posterity might think or say of them  SCENE IX  The tenor of Henry's character is still finely preserved in the following passage which as his cause was just and that his magnanimity and resolution so happily bore him through the infinite odds of opposition deserves well to be observed upon  When the two armies are just on the point of joining battle the French Herald comes again to the English camp repeating the same challenge as before from the Constable requiring to know what terms the king would propose for his ransom as supposing him already a captive  Henry  I pray thee bear my former answer back  Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones  Good God why should they mock poor fellows thus  The man that once did sell the lion's skin  While the beast lived was killed with hunting him  And many of our bodies shall no doubt  Find native graves upon the which I trust  Shall witness live in brass of this day's work  Let me speak proudly tell the Constable  We are but warriors for the working day  We have no holiday change of apparel to put on  We are men about our business    Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched  With rainy marching in the painful field  There's not a piece of feather  A soldier's plume▪  in our host  Good argument I hope we will not fly  And time hath worn us into slovenry  But by the mass our hearts are in the trim  And my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night  They'll be in fresher robes or they will pluck  The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers heads  And turn them out of service If they do  As if God please they shall my ransom then  Will soon be levyedHerald save thy labour  Come thou no more for ransom gentle Herald  They shall have none I swear but these my joints  Which if they have as I will leave 'em them  Shall yield them littleTell the Constable  SCENE XII  Here follows a noble example of bravery friendship loyalty and composure of mindin fine of every manly excellence and virtue most beautifully described in the recital of one short and single action on the field of battle  Henry  and  Exeter  Henry  Well have we done thrice valiant countrymen  But all's not done the French yet keep the field  Exeter  The Duke of York commends him to your majesty  Henry  Lives he good uncle Thrice within this hour  I saw him down thrice up again and fighting  From helmet to the spur all bleeding o'er  Exeter  In which array brave soldier doth he lie  Larding the plain and by his bloody side  Yokefellow to his honourowing wounds  The noble earl of Suffolk also lies  Suffolk first died and York all haggled over  Comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped  And takes him by the beard kisses the gashes  That bloodily did yawn upon his face  And cries aloud "Tarry my cousin Suffolk  "My soul shall thine keep company to heaven  "Tarry sweet soul for mine then fly abreast  "As in this glorious and wellfoughten field  "We kept together in our chivalry"  Upon these words I came and cheered him up  He smiled me in the face gave me his hand  And with a feeble gripe says "Dear my lord  "Commend my service to my sovereign"  So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck  He threw his wounded arm and kissed his lips  And so espoused to death with blood he sealed  A testament of noble ending love  The pretty and sweet manner of it forced  Those waters from me which I would have stopped  But I had not so much of man in me  But all my mother came into my eyes  And gave me up to tears  Henry  I blame you not  For hearing this I must perforce compound  With mistful eyes or they will issue too  An Alarm  But hark what new alarum is this same  The Poet has most judiciously interrupted Henry's speech in this critical place It would have been expected from him to have said something more upon so interesting an occasion and yet it would have been impossible to have carried either sentiment or expression higher than Exeter had just done on the same subject Shakespeare has herein imitated the address of Timanthes who in his picture of the sacrifice of Iphigenia covers her father's head with a veil  SCENE XIV  Henry  I was not angry since I came to France  Until this instant Take a trumpet Herald  Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill  If they will fight with us bid them come down  Or void the field they do offend our sight  If they'll do neither we will come to them  And make them sker away as swift as stones  Enforced from the old Assyrian slings  The first sentence in the above speech is one among the many instances in which Shakespeare has manifested his thorough knowledge in human nature Henry acts with an heroic resolution during the whole of this perilous conflict and replies with a daring and careless spirit to all the insolence and contempt of a powerful enemy but he expresses no rage nor betrays the least manner of resentment throughout The dangers and difficulties of his situation required the utmost command and preservation of his temper Distress and affliction are sovereign specifics for the pride and fierceness of man's nature But these restraints being now removed by his victory he begins to yield the rein a little to passion upon seeing the obstinacy of the enemy still continuing after their defeat  SCENE XVI  Here the passage hinted above from the latter part of the Fourth Scene in this Act comes to be cleared up when the soldier finds that the unknown person he had engaged to fight with was his king Upon this occasion he makes an apology for himself which may have its use in being extended to a general reflection applicable to all the superior ranks of life That those who demean themselves below their character or dignity can have no right to challenge that respect from the world which they might otherwise be intitled to  Henry  and the  Soldier  Henry  How canst thou make me satisfaction  Soldier  All offences my lord come from the heart never came any from mine that might offend your majesty  Henry  It was ourself thou didst abuse  Soldier  Your majesty came not like yourself you appeared to me but as a common man witness the night your garments your lowliness and what your highness suffered under that shape I beseech you take it for your fault and not mine for had you been as I took you for I made no offence therefore I beseech your highness pardon me  SCENE XVII  Henry preserves the same spirit of piety after his victory as he had expressed just before the action in Scene the Sixth of this Act in imputing his success to the arm and protection of Omnipotence alone  Henry Exeter  and  Fluellin  Henry  O God thy arm was here  And not to us but to thy arm alone  Ascribe we all When without stratagem  But in plain shock and even play of battle  Was ever known so great and little loss  On one part and on t'other Take it God  For it is only thine  Exeter  'Tis wonderful  Henry  Come go we in procession to the village  And be it death proclaimed through our host  To boast of this or take that praise from God  Which is his only  Fluellin  Is it not lawful an please your majesty to tell how many are killed  Henry  Yes captain but with this acknowledgment  That God fought for us  ACT V  SCENE III  In this Scene a congress is held between the English and French which is opened by the duke of Burgundy with a declamatory representation of a country during a state of war which moves me more even than the description of a battle would do The barbarous scene here set forth is more general and permanentThe latter passage which mentions the condition of uneducated youth is by much the most affecting part of the picture The former damage by labour money and a good harvest may be repaired but neither industry mines nor less than an age can retrieve the other loss  Burgundy  Since then my office hath so far prevailed  That face to face aad royal eye to eye  You have congreeted let it not disgrace me  If I demand before this royal view  What rub or what impediment there is  Why that the naked poor and mangled peace  Dear nurse of arts plenties and joyful births  Should not in this best garden of the world  Our fertile France put up her lovely visage  Alas she hath from France too long been chased  And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps  Corrupting in its own fertility  Her vine the merry chearer of the heart  Unpruned dies her hedges even pleached  Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair  Put forth disordered twigs her fallow leas  Leas  inclosed grounds    The darnel hemlock and rank fumitory  Doth root upon while that the coulter rusts  That should deracinate such savagery  The even mead that erst brought sweetly forth  The freckled cowslip burnet and green clover  Wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank  Conceives by idleness and nothing teems  But hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs  Losing both beauty and utility  And all our vineyards fallows meads and hedges  Defective in their nurtures grow to wildness  Even so our houses and ourselves our children  Have lost or do not learn for want of time  The sciences that should become our country  But grow like savages as soldiers will  That nothing do but meditate on blood  To swearing and stern looks diffused  Dif  used  for    attire  And every thing that seems unnatural  When a council is selected to retire apart and confer upon the preliminaries of peace the queen of France who is present at the treaty is asked by Henry whether she chuses to go with the plenipotentiaries or would stay where she is  Isabel  Our gracious brother I will go with them  Haply a woman's voice may do some good  When articles too nicely urged be stood on  What Isabel says upon this occasion is very true Men may be sometimes too sturdy with one another even in matters of mere punctilio or of trifling concern each too proud or obstinate to recede when the interposition of a woman may remove the difficulty or compose the ferment without either of the parties appearing to give up to the other  The interfering of a woman in disputes between men is seldom an indifferent matter It generally renders them either more gentle or more refractory  SCENE IV  Shakespeare appears to be so fond of the personage of Henry that though he has already raised him to the highest pitch in our admiration and esteem he continues to recommend him to us still further by introducing him in a new character and situation that of a lover and a courtier He did the same for Falstaff before in the Merry Wives of Windsor at the request of Queen Elizabeth but here he enters a volunteer in the service Had any other writer ventured on such an attempt he would have rendered him a quite different man from himself  as Racine has  misrepresented  Achilles but Henry continues to be the same person still only appearing in new circumstances the same humour playful spirit and careless ease remain in his courtship as may be seen in his rallying of Falstaff replying to Mountjoy or exchanging gages with the soldier  It is necessary to transcribe the intire dialogue between him and his mistress to support my observation as well as for the entertainment of my Reader  Henry Catharine  and a  French Lady  Henry  Fair Catharine most fair  Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms  Such as will enter at a lady's ear  And plead his lovesuit to her gentle heart  Catharine  Your majesty shall mock at me I cannot speak your England  Henry  O fair Catharine if you will love me soundly with your French heart I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue Do you like me Kate  Catharine  Pardonnez moy  I cannot tell what is  like me    Henry  An angel is like you Kate and you are like an angel  Catharine  Que dit il que je suis semblable à les anges  Lady  Oui vrayment sauve votre grace ainsi dit il  Henry  I said so dear Catharine and I must not blush to affirm it  Catharine  O bon Dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies  Henry  What says she fair one that tongues of men are full of deceit  Lady  Ouy  dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits Dat is de princess  Henry  The princess is the better English woman I'faith Kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding I am glad thou canst speak no better English for if thou could'st thou would find'st me such a plain king that thou would'st think I had sold my farm to buy a crown I know no ways to mince it in love but directly to say  I love you  then if you urge further than to say  do you in faith  I wear out my suit Give me your answer i'faith do and so clap hands and a bargain How say you lady  Catharine  Sauf votre honneur  me understand well  Henry  Marry if you put me to verses or to dance for your sake Kate why you undid me for the one I have neither words nor measure and for the other I have as little address If I could  win a lady at leapfrog or by  volting  Volting  for  vaulting  I have taken the liberty of spelling the word so to distinguish it from the builder's term according to an observation I have made on it in another place  To voit  comes from  voltiger to fly  and it is not pedantry to stick closely to an etymology when a deviation from it confounds the sense See Series of Letters vol vi page  into my saddle with my armour on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken I should quickly leap into matrimony Or if I might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favours I could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jackanapes  A monkey  never off But before God Kate I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence nor have I cunning in protestation only downright oaths which I never use till urged and never break for urging  This passage was so clear to all the Comentators I suppose that they have not given us any note upon it but I think it needs explanation The sense of it I take to be this I never swear except when urged by passion but the oath once  I never urge the rashness of it as an excuse for its breach  If thou canst love a fellow of this temper Kate whose face is not worth sunburning that never looks in his glass for love of any thing he sees there let thine eye be thy cook I speak plain soldier if thou canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that I shall die 'tis true but or thy love by the Lord no yet I love thee too And while thou livest Kate take a fellow of plain and uncoined  By this epithet the poet means to compare sincerity to  bulliongold  before it is alloyed for  coinage  The editors differ about the word but Shakespeare explains it in this sense before he finishes the sentence  because he hath not the gift to woe in other places  or gold is not so current as when turned into  specie    constancy for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for those fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into ladies favours they do always reason themselves out again  Reason themselves out again  The finding success so easy tempts them to pursue in  conquests forsaking their former  What a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad a good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curled pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart Kate is the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly If thou would'st have such a one take me take a soldier take a king And what say'st thou then to my love Speak my fair and fairly I pray thee  Catharine  Is it possible dat I should love de enemy of France  Henry  No it is not possible that you should love the enemy of France Kate but in loving me you should love the friend of France for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it I will have it all mine and Kate when France is mine and I am yours then yours is France and you are mine  Catharine  I cannot tell vat is dat  Henry  No Kate I will tell thee in French which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a bride about her husband's

Let me seeWhat then St Dennis be my speed  Donc votre est France vous etes mienne  It is as easy for me Kate to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French I shall never move thee in French unless it be to laugh at me  Catharine  Sauf votre honneur le Francois que vous parlez est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle  Henry  No faith it's not Kate but thy speaking of my tongue and I thine most truly falsely must needs be granted to be much at one But Kate dost thou understand so much English Canst thou love me  Catharine  I cannot tell  Henry  Can any of your neighbours tell Kate I'll ask them Come I know thou lovest me and at night when you come into your closet you'll question this gentlewoman about me and I know Kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you like best but good Kate mock me mercifully the rather gentle Princess because I love thee cruelly If ever thou beest mine Kate as I have saving faith within me tells me thou shalt I get thee with

dost notwithstanding the poor and untempting effect of my visage Now beshrew my father's ambition he was thinking of civil wars when he got me therefore was I created with a stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when I come to woo ladies I fright them but in faith Kate the elder I wax the better I shall  appear My comfort is that old age that ill layer up of beauty can do no more spoil

Catharine  Laissez mon Seigneur laissez laissezMa foy je ne veux point que vous abaissiez vostre grandeur en baisant la main de votre ind  gne serviteure  There is no such modern French word in the feminine gender    excusez moy je vous supplie mon tres puissant Seigneur  Henry  Then I will kiss your lips Kate  Catharine  Les dames demoiselles ne faut pas etre bais  es devant leur nopçesIl n'est

Mademoiselle    Lady  Your majesty  entendre  better  que moy    Henry  'Tis not a fashion for the maids of France to kiss before they are married would she say  Lady  Ouy vrayement  Henry  O Kate nice customs curtsie to great folks Dear Kate you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country's fashionWe are the makers of manners Kate and the liberty  The privileges or authority of superior rank  that follows our places stops the mouth of all findfaults as I will do yours for the upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kissThereforepatiently and yielding    Kissing her    You have witchcraft in your lips Kate there is more eloquence in a touch of them than in all the tongues of  the French council and they would sooner perswade Harry of England than a general petition of monarchs Here comes your father  In the last passage of the foregoing dialogue Henry affords a good subject for reflection where he speaks of the powerful influence of kings over the manners of a people The maxim appears to be plausible but is not true in every respect  Rank and example  alone will not be sufficient for this effect unsupported by  dignity and precept  It is not enough for a prince to act well himself and intend well to moralsHe must form a purpose for their support and be active in his general as well as private capacity A sovereign indeed has it in his power whenever it is in his will most effectually to encourage virtue and discourage vice if he chuses to make this object the rule of his polity This would be the surest and safest method of rendering himself absolute for as poor Cardinal Wolsey saysupon a maxim too late discovered  "Corruption wins not more than honesty"  Religion itself has judged it necessary to hold out distant rewards and punishments to allure and deter mankind and kings can only have a right to be stiled the vicegerents of Heaven when they render these sanctions more immediate A king is said to have long hands but they are of no use except to wrap himself up  while he keeps them folded    Lewis the Fourteenth happily brought such a  golden age  to bear toward the latter part of his illustrious reign if we may give credit to what St Evremond says in a letter of his to Ninon de l'Enclos  You live in a country where people have extraordinary advantages towards saving their souls There vice is almost as much against the fashion as against virtue Sinning passes for illbreeding shocks decency and offends good manners as much as religion Formerly it sufficed to be  wicked but at present one must be a scoundrel to be damned in France They who have not regard enough for another life are led to salvation by the consideration and duties of this  In order to leave the impression of this most interesting and moral reflection more strongly on the minds of the great the powerful and the opulent I shall here conclude my observations on this Piece so fruitful of example and document throughout  HENRY the SIXTH  FIRST PART  Dramatis Personae  MEN  HENRY THE SIXTH  DUKE OF GLOUCESTER Protector and Uncle to the King  BISHOP OF WINCHESTER Cardinal and Great Uncle to the King  RICHARD PLANTAGENET afterwards Duke of York  DUKE OF SOMERSET  DUKE OF ALANSON A French Peer  MORTIMER Earl of March  EARL OF WARWICK  EARL OF SUFFOLK  LORD TALBOT  WOMEN  None are brought upon the Scene throughout the few remarks I have had any opportunity of making on this Play  HENRY the SIXTH FIRST PART  ACT I  SCENE I  WINCHESTER speaking of the death of Henry the Fifth  He was a king blest of the King of Kings  Unto the French the dreadful judgment day  So dreadful will not be as was his sight  The battles of the Lord of Hosts he fought  The Church's prayers made him so prosperous  We may remember in the former Play that Henry the Fifth like a true Christian heroe imputes all his successes immediately to Heaven but the good Bishop I am sorry to say it like a true priest  of those days  here interposes between them and attributes his prosperity solely to the mediation of the Church  SCENE V  There is a good description given of the common English in the following speech  Alanson  They want their porridge and their fat bullbeeves  Either they must be dieted like mules  And have their provender tied to their mouths  Or piteous they will look like drowned mice  A true physical knowledge is here expressed A great part of personal courage depends upon the animal spirits and to keep men stout you must keep them strong If philosophy should be so difficult as to deny that good feeding can render a soldiery more brave it must admit however that it will render it more serviceable at least which is all that we mean to contend for here  ACT II  SCENE V  The partiality which we are all apt to manifest towards our own interests is well noted in this place This principle is so powerful in human nature that it not only engages our affections but warps our judgments also so that it often imposes on our reason and frequently makes us continue obstinate more from error than selfishness Our opinions differ even in matters of no concernment to us and how much less is it to be expected that we should be of accord when we are become a party in the question ourselves  Somerset and Plantagenet being engaged in a warm dispute appeal to the umpirage of a third indifferent person with all the seeming candor imaginable  Somerset  Judge you my lord of Warwick then between us  Warwick  Between two hawks which flies the higher pitch  Between two dogs which hath the deeper mouth  Between two blades which bears the better temper  Between two horses which doth bear him best  Between two girls which hath the merriest eye  I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment  But in these nice sharp quillets of the law  Good faith I am no wiser than a daw  Plantagenet  Tut tut here is a mannerly forbearance  The truth appears so naked on my side  That any purblind eye may find it out  Somerset  And on my side it is so well apparelled  So clear so shining and so evident  That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye  SCENE VI  There is something extremely moving in the first part of this Scene which shews a prison from whence old Earl Mortimer is brought forth in a chair before the gates attended by his gaolers He had been unfortunately declared heir to the Crown by Richard the Second and was therefore kept a  prisoner of State during the reigns of Henrys the Fourth and Fifth and continued still in confinement under the present king also  We are naturally more affected at the distresses of age infancy or women than with what we see suffered by the adult or robust unfortunate Our compassion rises in proportion to the weakness of the victim as we become sensible of the inability of resistance along with the weight of the oppression  The earnest desire which the unhappy old man expresses here for the relief of death is very natural to a person in his circumstances and can by no means be deemed reprehensible in such a situation when the completion of the wish is not forwarded by any act of violence or impatience in the sufferer  Mortimer  Kind keepers  of my weak decaying age  Let dying Mortimer here rest himself  Even like a wretch new haled from the rack  So fare my limbs with long imprisonment  And these grey locks the  pursuivants of death    Nestorlike aged in an age of care  Argue the end of hapless Mortimer  These eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent  Wax dim as drawing to their exigent  ExigentEnd  We meet with the word no where in this sense but here    Weak shoulders overborn with burdening grief  And pithless arms like to a withered vine  That drops his sapless branches to the ground  Yet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numb  Unable to support this lump of clay  Swiftwinged with desire to get a grave  As witting I no other comfort have  The first expression above of  kind keepers  is most tenderly affectingA noble and a gallant mind is here represented as being so subdued by the hardness of its condition as to be reduced to the mortifying necessity of soothing and temporizing with the vile ministers of cruelty and oppression A sad object this indeed  ACT IV SCENE I  Here is given a description of the qualifications which had intitled the first Knights of the Garter to that honourable mark of distinction upon the original institution of the Order a respect to which has been ever since so  minutely  attended to that  the same dresses badges and vows of chivalry  have been still preserved free from all violation The character likewise we are surely to suppose has been as critically regarded  Talbot to the King and Princes upon an arraignment of  Sir John Fastolfe  This is not our quondam merry Knight though the near resemblance of the names and pusillanimity of the characters might possibly render the person equivocal to the reader  Knight of the Garter for cowardice  When first this Order was ordained my lords  Knights of the Garter were of noble birth  Valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage  Such as were grown to credit by the wars  Not fearing death nor shrinking for distress  But always resolute in most extremes  He then that is not furnished in this sort  Doth but usurp the sacred name of Knight  Prophaning this most honourable Order  And should if I were worthy to be judge  Be quite degraded like a hedgeborn swain  That doth presume to boast of gentle blood  ACT V  SCENE II  The following reflection has too often been made both before and since the aera here pointed out It is shocking to humanity as well as to religion to think that there should ever have been and should still continue such frequent occasions to repeat it  King  I always thought  It was both impious and unnatural  That such immanity and bloody strife  Should reign among professors of one faith  In the same Scene when the king is urged to think of marrying he very properly objects to the  proposal both on account of his youth and the necessity of applying his mind to the studies becoming his rank and situation  King  Marriage Alas my years are yet too young  And fitter is my study and my books  Than wanton dalliance with a paramour  Such considerations it seems were regarded in those days and in the time of our Author likewise or he would not have commented on the subject Are we grown wiser  SCENE VIII  This same topic of matrimony is fully discussed and in a more general and liberal manner in the present Scene upon Exeter's objecting to the match proposed on account of the Princess mentioned not being sufficiently endowed with fortune  Suffolk  A dower my lords Disgrace not so your king  That he should be so abject base and poor  To chuse for wealth and not for perfect love  Henry is able to enrich his queen  And need not seek a queen to make him rich  So worthless peasants bargain for their wives  As marketmen for oxen sheep or horse  But marriage is a matter of more worth  Than to be dealt in by attorneyship  Not whom we will but whom his grace affects  Must be companion of his nuptial bed  And therefore lords since he affects her most  It most of all these reasons bindeth us  In our opinions she should be preferred  For what is wedlock forced but a hell  An age of discord and continual strife  Whereas the contrary bringeth forth bliss  And is a pattern of celestial peace  These arguments are certainly conclusive in private life and if  reasons of state  may be allowed to stand against them in the supremest rank I shall only conclude my remarks on this Piece with a line of an old song in favour of our natural and chartered liberties  "If so happy's  a miller  then who'd be  a king  "  HENRY the SIXTH  SECOND

lord your faulcon made  And what a pitch she flew above the rest  To see how God in all his creatures works  Yea man and birds are fain of climbing high  Here the king has made a philosophic reflection on the aspiring but commendable nature of man which is improved with a religious sense in the reply  Gloucester  My lord 'tis but a base ignoble mind  That mounts no higher than a bird can soar  This passage seems to be an imitation of a Latin sentence I have somewhere met with▪ and venture to quote from memory only  Spes aquilas supervola  Hope soars beyond an eagle's flight  I do not mean to adduce this instance in order to support an opinion of Shakespeare's learning but merely to shew that good wits may sometimes  fly  as well as  jump  together The severest critic may surely pardon a play on words in a comment upon so sportive an author It would be an invidious reflection on our poet's fame to suppose him to have been a scholar A genius  lends  thoughts a scholar but  borrows  them    SCENE III  When a charge has been exhibited against the duchess of Gloucester for treason and sorcery the Cardinal a declared enemy to the duke her husband takes occasion to insult him upon this misfortune to which he thus answers  Gloucester  Ambitious churchman leave to afflict my heart  Sorrow and grief have vanquished all my powers  And vanquished as I am I yield to thee  Or to the meanest groom  The above is one of Shakespeare's just delineations of human nature That spirit which could not be subdued by any personal difficulty or danger becomes suddenly abated on the mortification arising from the shame and vice of one so nearly and dearly allied to him  I have been much obliged throughout this Work to the Commentators for not having noted many such passages as this They have rarely touched upon our Author's anatomy of human nature contenting themselves like sculptors or painters with only marking its outward form its colours and proportions the veins arteries and finer capillaries of the inward man remaining often undissected  SCENE VII  Here the good duke upon the occasion of his wife's ignominy and penance makes a reflection on the general nature of human life which he illustrates with an apt allusion  Gloucester  Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud  And after summer evermore succeeds  The barren winter with his nipping cold  So cares and joys abound as seasons fleet  Just after this he speaks of the unhappy woman with a moving tenderness and concludes his speech with a description frequently given by Shakespeare of the base nature of the whiffling multitude  Unneath  Unneath  hardly or scarcely a Saxon or Norman adverb  may she endure the flinty streets  To tread them with her tender feeling feet  Sweet Nell ill can thy noble mind abrook  The abject people gazing on thy face  With envious looks still laughing at thy shame  That erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels  When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets  ACT III  SCENE VII  The following passage needs no comment  King  What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted  Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just  And he but naked though locked up in steel  Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted  SCENE X  This whole scene is so justly commended by all the critics that I shall give it to the Reader intire  The King Salisbury and Warwick standing by the Cardinal on his sickbed  King  How fares my lord Speak Beaufort to thy sovereign  Cardinal  raving  If thou beest Death I'll give thee England's treasure  Enough to purchase such another island  So thou wilt let me live and feel no pain  King  Ah what a sign it is of evil life  Where death's approach is seen so terrible  Warwick  Beaufort it is thy sovereign speaks to thee  Cardinal  Bring me unto my trial when you will  Died he not in his bed  Raving of Humphrey whom he had caused to be murdered  Where should he die  Can I make men live whether they will or no  Oh torture me no more I will confess  Alive again Then shew me where he is  I'll give a thousand pounds to look upon him  He hath no eyes the dust hath blinded them  Comb down his hairlook look it stands upright  Like limetwigs set to catch my winged soul  Give me some drink and bid the apothecary  Bring the strong poison that I bought of him  King  O thou Eternal Mover of the Heavens  Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch  O beat away the busy meddling fiend  That lays strong siege upon this wretch's soul  And from his bosom purge this black despair  Warwick  See how the pangs of death do make him writhe  Salisbury  Disturb him notlet him pass peaceably  King  Peace to his soul if God's good pleasure be  Lord Cardinal if thou think'st on Heaven's bliss  Hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope  He dies and makes no signO God forgive him  Warwick  So bad a death argues a monstrous life  King  Forbear to judge for we are sinners all  Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close  And let us all to meditation  The above scene closes very properly with a truly Christian sentiment by the King who is all through represented by Shakespeare as a religious▪ moral domestic easytempered man  Famed for mildness peace and prayer  Third Part    Just such a prince whose very goodness for want of sense and spirit must ever render the dupe of Ministers and the sport of Faction  No document no example are so effectual a warning to the mind as the view of a wicked person in his last moments This speaks to the heart as well as to the understanding We then see things and actions in their true light which the false glare of gain or pleasure or the involved and complicated nature of sin are but too apt to hide from our notice Vice would disgust even those that practise it if they did not use arts to conceal the vileness of it from their own view We drink liquors out of a cup which are too foul to bear a glass  He who has betrayed a friend deceived a mistress wronged the orphan or oppressed the poor must surely never have seen a penitent on his deathbed What desperate madness then must it be ever to do a deed for any advantage in life which after so short  so very short  a space of time we would give a galaxy of worlds to have undone again  This is the only way of rendering dramatic deaths profitable to the spectators All the pantomime contortions writhings and flouncings of modern representations cannot possibly produce such an effect on the audience as this single expression  He dies and makes no sign    ACT IV SCENE VIII  King  Was ever king that joyed an earthly throne  And could command no more content than I  No sooner was I crept out of my cradle  But I was made a king at nine months old  Yet never subject longed to be a king  As I do long and wish to be a subject  Shakespeare lays hold of every occasion that fairly presents itself to put his readers out of conceit with greatness And in truth the state of kings in general even the happiest of them who are undoubtedly  those whose power is limited  is not much to be envied Their public care if they rule alone or their private hazard if they depute the helm must deny them ease the only foundation for earthly happiness or enjoyment to rest upon Kings may in some sort be compared to Popish idols which are worshipped and led about in pageant procession for the purpose of procuring some partial wish of the people which if not obtained however unreasonable the petition they are then scourged and laid by in disgrace  HENRY THE SIXTH  THIRD PART  Dramatis Personae  MEN  HENRY THE SIXTH

obsolete expressions in them  alderlievest unneath mailed meseemeth darraign exigent abrook  c  Mr Theobald does not enumerate the words but I have taken this task upon me in order to give the fullest force to his criticism The Antients have left us an humane maxim  that we should never speak ill of the dead  I think we should carry this moral even further  by doing them every justice in our power  What has particularly induced me to make this remark is that Doctor Johnson says he can observe but two expressions of the old phraseology throughout these three Plays I do not mean to make any comparison between the sense knowledge or literature of these two critics but Dr Johnson is alive to answer for himself and poor Theobald must now speak by another's tongue  and Doctor Warburton is of the same opinion from the want of spirit and effect in the composition If I was to offer an objection to the authenticity of these Pieces it should be rather from their barrenness of sentiment or reflection though I think there is enough of the stile and manner of Shakespeare in them all to evince them to be his  ACT II  SCENE III  There is a natural instinct even stronger than that of selfpreservation implanted in all the brute creation for the safety of their youngThe simplest animals manifest an art and the most pusillanimous shew a courage in the defence of their progeny but this only till they become capable of taking care of themselves Account for this Providence upon the principle of uninspired  mechanism  if ye can ye  unphilosophic  Sophisters  Clifford  Unreasonable  Irrational  creatures feed their young  And though man's face be fearful to their eyes  Yet in protection of their tender ones  Who hath not seen them even with those wings  Which sometimes they have used with fearful flight  Make war with him that climbs unto their nest  Offering their own lives in their young's defence  SCENE VI  The ease and security of the subject is finely contrasted with the anxiety and danger of the Prince in one of our Author's oftrepeated reflections upon this subject in a soliloquy made by the King reclining on a hillock during the warfare between the houses of York and Lancaster  Would I were dead if God's good will were so  For what is in this world but grief and woe  O God methinks it were a happier life  To be no better than a homely swain  To sit upon a hill as I do now  To carve out dials quaintly point by point  Thereby to mark the minutes as they run  How many make the hour  Throughout this speech and many other places our Author uses  hour  as a word of two syllables  full compleat  How many hours bring about the day  How many days will finish up the year  How many years a mortal man may live  When this is known then to divide the time  So many hours must I tend my flock  So many hours must I take my rest  So many hours must I contemplate  So many hours must I sport myself  So many days my ewes have been with young  So many weeks ere the poor fools will yean  So many months ere I shall sheer the fleece  So minutes hours days weeks months and years  Past over to the end they were created  Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave  Ah what a life were this how sweet how lovely  Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade  To shepherds looking on their silly sheep  Than doth a richembroidered canopy  To kings that fear their subjects' treachery  O yes it dotha thousandfold it doth  And to conclude the shepherd's homely curds  His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle  His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade  All which secure and sweetly he enjoys  Is far beyond a prince's delicates  His viands sparkling in a golden cup  His body couched on a curious bed  When care mistrust and treasons wait on him  ACT III SCENE I  Upon the occasion of Queen Margaret and Warwick's going to France one to solicit the aid of Lewis for Lancaster and the other for York poor Henry makes a very natural reflection foreboding how the ballance will probably incline where interest holds the scales between two supplicants whereof one has only something  to ask  and the other something  to proffer    King  My queen and son are gone to France for aid  And as I hear the great commanding Warwick  Is thither gone to crave the French king's sister  To wife for Edward If this news be true  Poor queen and son your labour is but lost  For Warwick is a subtle orator  And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words  By this account then Margaret may win him  For she's a woman to be pitied much  Her sighs will make a battery in his breast  Her tears will pierce into a marble heart  The tyger will be mild while she doth mourn  And Nero would be tainted with remorse  To hear and see her plaints▪ her brinish tears  Ay but she's come to begWarwick to give  She on his left side craving aid for Henry  He on his right asking a wife for Edward  She weeps and says her Henry is deposed  He smiles and says his Edward is installed  That she poor wretch for grief can speak no more  While Warwick tells his title smooths the wrong  Inferreth arguments of mighty strength  And in conclusion wins the king from her  With promise of his sister and what else  To strengthen and support king Edward's place  O Margaret thus 'twill be and thou poor soul  Art then forsaken as thou went'st forlorn  In the same Scene this unhappy Prince who appears throughout to be more fit for a subject than  a king and yet not the less fit to be the latter  for this very reason  replies with philosophy and virtue to the person who is going to take him prisoner and who asks him  But if thou be a king where is thy crown  King  My crown is in my heart not on my head  Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones  Not to be seen my crown is called  Content    A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy  In the last line we may see that Shakespeare takes one of his many occasions to humble ambition and depreciate greatness He is eternally acting the part of the slave placed behind the triumphal car not indeed to shew his own envy but to abate another's pride  ACT IV  SCENE I  The true policy of England with regard to all foreign states is given here in a very few words with a particular hint of ministerial prudence respecting all leagues or treaties with France  Hastings  'Tis better  using  France than  trusting  her  Let us be backed with God and with the seas  Which he hath given for fence impregnable  And with their helps alone defend ourselves  In them and in ourselves our safety lies  SCENE V  After the observation above made in the Third Scene Act II upon the fond instinct of all irrational animals for the preservation of their brood it would be unjust as well as unphilosophic too not to pay a like compliment to our own species by quoting a passage in this Scene where the wife of Edward the Fourth marks the same kind of tenderness and attention in a becoming manner upon hearing that her husband has been made prisoner by Warwick  Rivers  These news I must confess are full of grief  Yet gracious madam bear it as you may  Warwick may lose that now hath won the day  Queen  'Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay  And I the rather wean me from despair  For love of Edward's offspring in my womb  This is't that makes me bridle in my passion  And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross  Ay ay for this I draw in many a tear  And stop the rising of blood sucking sighs  Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown  King Edward's fruit true heir to England's crown  SCENE VII  Here Shakespeare takes an occasion by the means of an  ex post facto  prophecy to pay a compliment to Queen Elizabeth resembling the  Tu Marcellus eris  of Virgil to Livia  The  King  to  Richmond  laying his hand on his head    Come hither England's hopeIf secret powers  Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts  This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss  His looks are full of majesty  His head by nature formed to wear a crown  His hand to wield a scepter and himself  Likely in time to bless a regal throne  Make much of him my lords for this is he  Must help you more than you are hurt by me  This Earl of Richmond was afterwards Henry the Seventh and united the two houses of York and Lancaster in his own person He was grandfather to Queen Elizabeth  ACT IV SCENE VII  I shall here conclude my remarks on this Play with a truth which is not the less worth attending to for being spoken by a villain as this character might have but the better enabled him to ascertain the fact  Gloucester  Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind  The thief doth fear each bush an officer  RICHARD THE THIRD  Dramatis Personae  MEN  RICHARD Duke of Gloucester afterwards Richard the Third  EARL OF RICHMOND afterwards Henry the

ELY  BRACKENBURY Lieutenant of the Tower  SIR JAMES TYRREL  SIR RICHARD RATCLIFF  WOMEN  QUEEN of Edward the Fourth  LADY ANNE Widow of the Prince of Wales Son to Henry the Sixth  DUCHESS OF YORK Mother to Richard the Third  COUNTESS OF RICHMOND Mother to the Earl of Richmond and Wife to Lord Stanley  RICHARD the THIRD  ACT I  SCENE I  EVERY representation either of a scene or season of peace is peculiarly soothing to the human mind 'Tis its own most natural and pleasing state But when it is contrasted with the opposite condition of tumult and war the delight rises infinitely higher There are many such descriptions as this in Shakespeare and as the imbuing the mind with such contemplations must certainly have a moral tendency in it I am glad to transcribe every passage of the kind I meet with in him  Richard  alone  Now is the winter of our discontent  Made glorious summer by this sun of York  Edward the Fourth    And all the clouds that lowered upon our house  In the deep bosom of the ocean buried  Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths  Our bruised arms hung up for monuments  Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings  Our dreadful marches to delightful measures  Grimvisaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front  And now instead of mounting barbed steeds  To fright the souls of fearful adversaries  He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber  To the lascivious pleasing of a lute  In the following part of the same speech our poet zealous for the honour of the human character most artfully contrives to make Richard's wickedness appear to arise from a resentment against the partiality of Nature in having stigmatized him with so deformed a person joined to an envious jealousy towards the rest of mankind for being endowed with fairer forms and more attractive graces By this  admirable address he moves us to a sort of compassion for the misfortune even while he is raising an abhorrence for the vice of the criminal  Richard  But I that am not shaped for sportive tricks  Nor made to court an amorous lookingglass  I that am rudely stampt and want love's majesty  To strut before a wanton ambling nymph  I that am curtailed of this fair proportion  Cheated of feature by dissembling Nature  T  wo  s here strained to express  partial  or  malicious      Deformed unfinished sent before my time  Into this breathing world scarce half made up  And that so lamely and unfashionably  That dogs bark at me as I halt by them  Why I in this weak piping time of peace  Have no delight to pass away the time  Unless to spy my shadow in the sun  And descant on my own deformity  And therefore since I cannot prove a lover  To entertain these fair wellspoken days  I am determined to prove a villain  And  bate  Bate  re  gn or scorn instead of  hate  which was the word in the text    the idle pleasures of these days  SCENE II  This long Scene in which Richard courts Lady Anne relict of the first Prince of Wales son to Henry the Sixth whom he had murdered is so well known to every one who has ever read or seen this Play that I need not be at the trouble of transcribing it though I shall take the liberty of remarking on the very improbable conclusion of it  Women are certainly most extremely ill used in the unnatural representation of female frailty here given But it may perhaps be some palliation of his offence to observe that this strange fable was not any invention of the poet though it must indeed be confessed that he yielded too easy a credence to a fictitious piece of history which rested upon no better authority than the same that affirmed the deformity of Richard which fact has lately from a concurrence of cotemporary testimonies been rendered  problematical at least by a learned and ingenious author  See a Tract upon this subject by the Honourable Horatio Walpole    The conclusion of the Fifth Scene of Act the Fourth in this Play where the Queen widow of Edward the Fourth after the death of Lady Anne promises her daughter to this tyrant and usurper who had killed her sons is founded likewise upon the same disingenuous authority with the two former passages  SCENE III  Lord Stanley upon the Queen's expressing a suspicion that his wife the countess of Richmond bears her some ill will makes her defence in a speech which would conduce greatly to the peace of our minds and the preserving many of our most friendly connections unbroken if properly attended to and made the rule of our conduct through life  Stanley  I do beseech you either not believe  The envious slanders of her false accusers  Or if she be accused on true report  Bear with her weakness which I think proceeds  From wayward sickness and no grounded malice  The evil report of things said to be spoken to the disadvantage of others behind their backs has so frequently been found to proceed either from the malice or mistake of eavesdroppers listeners or incendiaries that it should warn us upon such occasions to suspend our resentments against the persons charged till we find the indictment to be grounded on better evidence than those pests of society the informers intermeddlers or talebearers Besides which as is above observed every reasonable allowance ought to be made for the natural frowardness and peevishness of disorder or other uneasiness of body or mind which often sets us first at variance with ourselves before it inclines us to quarrel with others  Infirmity doth still neglect all office  Whereto our health is bound  LEAR  SCENE V  Shakespeare is here again at his frequent reflections on the vanity of ambition and the cares of greatness  Brackenbury  Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours  Makes the night morning and the noontide night  Princes have but their titles for their troubles  Troubles  for  glories  well exchanged by Doctor Johnson    An outward honour for an inward toil  And for unfelt imaginations  They often feel a world of restless cares  So that between their titles and low name  There's nothing differs but the outward fame  ACT II  SCENE II  When the Queen is lamenting the death of Edward the Fourth the marquis of Dorset her son by a former husband says to her  Dorset  Comfort dear mother God is much displeased  That with unthankfulness you take his doing  In common worldly things 'tis called ungrateful  With dull unwillingness to pay a debt  Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent  Much more to be thus opposite with Heaven  For  For  to be understood here in the sense of  because    it requires the royal debt it lent you  Shakespeare is extremely rich in such sentiments of piety and resignation It is a vast ease to the distressed mind to communicate its griefs to the ear of a friend though he can only condole but not relieve them How infinitely higher then must the comfort rise to repose them on the bosom of our God who can not only console but compensate them Christ has not taken the  sins  alone but the  sorrows  also of mankind upon himself for those who place their hope and put their trust in him He not only says "Thy sins are forgiven thee" but adds this comfort in affliction  Come unto me all ye that  labour  and are  heavy laden  and I will give ye  rest    SCENE IV  There is a natural representation of a distempered state just preceding a revolution given in this Scene  Three citizens conferring together on the circumstances of the times hold the following dialogue together  First Citizen  Come come we fear the worst  all may be well    Second Citizen  When clouds are seen wise men put on their cloaks  When great leaves fall then winter is at hand  When the sun sets who doth not look for night  Untimely storms make men expect a dearth  All may be well  But if God sort it so  'Tis more than we deserve or I expect  Third Citizen  Truly the hearts of men are full of fear  You cannot reason almost with a man  That looks not heavily and full of dread  Second Citizen  Before the days of change still is it so  By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust  Ensuing danger as by proof we see  The waters swell before a boisterous storm  But leave it all to God  Now nothing can demonstrate the investigating faculties of Shakespeare more than this passage does He never lived in any times of commotion himself therefore the particular knowledge he here shews in the general nature of such a crisis must be owing more to philosophy than experience rather to his own reflection than any knowledge of history I speak with regard to the English writers only on such subjects who were all before his time most barren of observation and maxim And as to the Greek and Roman historiographers who were rich in both the invidious Commentators of our Poet have denied him any manner of acquaintance with such  outlandish literati  and I also though from a very different principle have  joined issue  with them before in this particular  In a note on Ely's speech Hen V Act I Scene II  For learning gives no  talents but only supplies the faculty of shewing them and this he could do without any foreign assistance  ACT III  SCENE I  The poor unhappy Prince of Wales successor to Edward the Fourth makes a reflection here so becoming the natural spirit of a noble mind that it must raise a regret in the Reader that he was not permitted to l  ve and reign over a brave and a free people  When his wicked uncle Richard appoints the Prince's residence at the  Tower  till his coronation he asks who built that fortress and being told it was Julius Caesar he says  That Julius Caesar was a famous man  With what his valour did enrich his wit  His wit set down to make his valour live  Death makes no conquest of this conqueror  For still he lives in fame though not in life  SCENE V  Richard  My lord of Ely when I was last in  Holborn    I saw good strawberries in your garden there  I do beseech you send for some of them  Ely  Marry and will my lord with all my heart  Exit Ely  Could any writer but Shakespeare have ever thought of such a circumstance in the midst of a deep tragedy as the sending an old grave Bishop on an errand for a  leaf of strawberries  and this in the most formal scene of the Play too where the lords are met in council to settle about the day for the coronation  But could any writer but himself have attempted such a whim without setting the audience alaughing at the ridiculousness and absurdity of such an incident And yet he contrives somehow or other to hold us in awe all the while though he must be a very ingenious critic indeed who can supply any sort of reason for the introduction of such a familiar and comic stroke upon so serious an occasion And  what renders the solution of this passage still more difficult is that the request is made by a person too whose mind was deeply intent on murder and usurpation at the very time  None of the editors have taken the least notice of this article and the first notion that occurred to me upon it was that perhaps Richard wanted to get rid of old Ely after any manner however indecent or abrupt in order to be at liberty to plot with Buckingham in private for the moment the Bishop goes out on his errand he says  Cousin of Buckingham a word with you  But as he did not send the rest of the CouncilBoard apacking after him and adjourn them from  the bed of justice  to the  strawberry bed  but retires immediately himself with his complotter Buckingham we cannot suppose this idea to have been the purpose intended by so extraordinary a motion  There is then no other way left us to resolve this text than to impute it solely to the peculiar character that Shakespeare has given us all along of this extraordinary personage whom he has represented throughout as preserving a facetious humour and exerting a sort of careless ease in the midst of all his crimes  I am sorry not to be able to give a better account of this particular than what I have here offered because if it is to rest upon such a comment our author must in this instance be thought to have betrayed a manifest ignorance in human nature or the nature of guilt at least as no vicious person I do not mean those of profligate manners merely but no designing or determined villain was ever chearful yet or could possibly be able to assume even the semblance of carelessness or ease upon any occasion whatsoever  In the latter part of this Scene poor Hastings just before he mounts the scaffold makes a reflection which too frequently occurs to those  who put their trust in princes  or indeed in general to all who rest their hope on any other stay but their own uprightness and virtue  Hastings  O momentary grace of mortal men  Which we more hunt for than the grace of God  Who builds his hope in air of your fair looks  Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast  Ready with every nod to tumble down  Into the fatal bowels of the deep  ACT IV  SCENE III  Among the various crimes of man murder stands in a distinct class above them all except perhaps suicide as being of the same species may be allowed to rank with or even to exceed it The latter par  of this position tho' has been disputed by some moral casuists but I shall enter no further into the argument here than just to observe that one of these acts does not shock the human mind so much as the other We are sensible of a tenderness and compassion for the unhappy selfdevoted victim but are impressed both with an horror and detestation against the homicide  But the circumstance which most eminently distinguishes both of these crimes from every other species of guilt is their being so wholly repugnant to nature In other vices we may suffer a temptation and have only a moral struggle to conquer but one must be trained be  educated  to these must stifle sympathy and overcome our  first  by a  second  nature  And of all murders from the days of  Herod  to these the killing a child must surely raise a stronger war in the most hardened villain's breast than the slaughter of an adult Its innocence its engaging manners even its very helplessness must plead so movingly in its defence as to render the deed one should think impossible Might not the idea of a  child's coming so recently out of the hands of its Creator serve also to impress an additional awe on the mind of the malefactor at such a time If superstition can ever be excused for its weakness it must surely be in such an instance as this  Shakespeare has wrought up an horrid and affecting picture in this scene upon the latter part of this subject where he makes one of the murderers give an account of the massacre of Edward's two children  Tirrel  The tyrannous and bloody act is done  The most arch deed of piteous massacre  That ever yet this land was guilty of  Dighton  and  Forrest  whom I did suborn  To do this piece of ruthless butchery  Albeit they were flesht villains bloody dogs  Melting with tenderness and mild compassion  Wept like two children in their deaths' sad story  O thus quoth  Dighton  lay the gentle babes  Thus thus quoth  Forrest  girdling one another  Within their innocent alabaster arms  Their lips were four red roses on a stalk  And in their summer beauty kissed each other  A book of prayers on their pillow lay  Which once quoth  Forrest  almost changed my mind  But oh the devilThere the villain stopt  When  Dighton  thus told onWe smothered  The most replenished sweet work of nature  That from the prime creation e'er she framed  Hence both are gone With conscience and remorse  They could not speak  In the latter part of the same Scene is expressed a just and spirited maxim which I believe will be sufficiently vouched by experience That in difficult matters quick resolves and brisk actions generally succeed better than slow counsels and circumspect conduct  Richard on hearing of the defection of his forces  Come I have learned that fearful commenting  Is leaden servitor to dull delay  Delay leads impotent and snailpaced beggary  Then fiery expedition be my wing  Jove's Mercury and herald for a king  Go muster men my council is my shield  We must be brief when traitors brave the field  SCENE IV  The temporary relief which an opportunity of expressing its sorrows affords to the mind of a person in affliction is poetically described in a passage here  The  Queen  and  Duchess  of  York  Duchess  Why should calamity be full of words  Queen  Windy attornies to their clientwoes  Airy succeeders of  intestate joys  Intestate joys  This expression is difficult The only editor who has taken notice of it is Theobald but his comment is as obscure as the text I shall not attempt it    Poor breathing orators of miseries  Let them have scope though what they do impart  Help nothing else yet they do ease the heart  ACT V SCENE V  In this Scene the adverse camps are supposed to be pitched near each other at night ready to join battle in the morning and in the space between the spirits of all the persons murdered by  Richard  arise threatening destruction to him and promising success to  Richmond  But the ghosts here are not to be taken literally they are to be understood only as an allegorical representation of those images or ideas which naturally occur to the minds of men during their sleep referring to the actions of their lives whether good or bad  Sweet are the slumbers of the virtuous man  says Addison in his Cato and a modern writer in a poem on the subject of dreams most emphatically expresses himself thus  Nor are the oppressor's crimes in sleep forgot  He starts appalled  for conscience slumbers not  Something New  Chap XLIX    That this is the sense in which our Poet meant this scene to be accepted is fully evident from his representing both  Richard  and  Richmond  to have been asleep during the apparition and therefore capable  of receiving those notices in  the mind  's  eye  only as Hamlet says which intirely removes the seeming absurdity of such an exhibition  The soliloquy of selfaccusation which Richard enters upon alone immediately after the spectral vision is closed though so strongly marked is nothing more than might be supposed natural in the circumstances and situation of the speaker as there described  Richard  starting from his couch    Give me another horsebind up my wounds  Have mercy JesuSoft I did but dream  O coward conscience how dost thou afflict me  The lights burn blueis it not dead midnight  Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh  What do I fear myself there's none else by  My conscience hath a thousand several tongues  And every tongue brings in a several tale  And every tale condemns me for a villain  All several sins all used in each degree  Throng to the bar all crying  Guilty guilty  I shall despairThere is no creature loves me  And if I die no soul shall pity me  Nay wherefore should they Since even I myself  Find in myself no pity for myself  Enter  Ratcliff  Richard  Who's there  Ratcliff  My lord the early village cock  Hath twice done salutation to the morn  Your friends are up and buckle on their armour  Richard  Ratcliff I fear I fear  Ratcliff  Nay good my lord be not afraid of shadows  Richard  By the apostle  Paul  shadows tonight  Have struck more terror to the soul of  Richard    Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers  Armed in proof and led by shallow  Richmond    I shall here close my observations on this Play with a reflection upon the last paragraph above  Such is the nature of man that the slightest alarm arising from within discomfits him more than the greatest dangers presenting themselves from without Body may be overcome by body but the mind only can conquer itself Notions of religion are natural to all men in some sort or other The good are inspired by devotion the bad terrified by superstition The admonitions of conscience are taken for supernatural emotions and this awes us more than any difficulty in the common course of things Man has been severally defined a  risible  a  rational  a  religious  and a  bashful  animal May I take the liberty of adding the farther criterion of his being a  conscientious  one And this distinction I shall venture to say is less equivocal than any of the others  HENRY the EIGHTH  Dramatis Personae  MEN  HENRY THE EIGHTH  DUKE OF NORFOLK  DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM  CARDINAL WOLSEY  CARDINAL

well arrive at by the sole advantages of learning and natural endowments and whose end was unfortunate through vanity insolence and the unstable favour of princes there may be an useful lesson deduced from every circumstance of his life respecting either his rise grandeur or decline  In a dialogue between Buckingham and Norfolk in this Scene the former speaking of his vanity and presumption with that contempt which persons of  noble families and hereditary fortunes  are sometimes too apt to express towards men  whose whole worth is centered in themselves  the latter engages in his defence upon a very just and liberal argument  Norfolk  Yet surely Sir  There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends  For not being propt by ancestry whose grace  Chalks successors their way nor called upon  For high feats done to the crown neither allied  To eminent assistants but spiderlike  Out of his selfdrawing webThis gives us note  The force of his own merit makes his way  A gift that Heaven gives to him which buys  A place next to the king  Doctor Young treats the same subject in as proper a manner but with the addition of satire and ridicule  Let high birth triumph What can be more great  Nothing  but merit in a low estate  UNIVER PAS  SCENE II  The angry Duke repeats his spleen against him in this Scene also upon the same proud prejudice or mistaken estimate of things  Buckingham  A beggar'sbook outworths a noble's blood  This  most noble and puissant prince  The stile and title of a Duke  was unlucky in having lived in such an  ignoble  age  Nobles  meet with no such mortifications  nowadays    In the continuation of this dialogue the impatient spirit of Buckingham is finely contrasted with the calm temper of Norfolk who illustrates his documents of prudence to him with equal philosophy and poesy  The Cardinal had just crossed the Scene in all his state casting a look of disdain on Buckingham which the more raised his choler  Norfolk  What are you chafed  Ask God for temperance  that's the appliance only  Which your disease requires  Buckingham  I read in's look  Matter against me and his eye reviled  Me as his abject object at this instant  He bores  I do not comprehend the meaning of this expression and the Commentators have given me no assistance  me with some trick He's gone to th' king  I'll follow and outstare him  Norfolk  Stay my lord  And let your reason with your choler question  What 'tis you go about To climb steep hills  Requires slow pace at first  Anger is like  A fullhot horse who being allowed his way  Self mettle tires him  Not a man in England  Can advise me like youBe to yourself  As you would to your friend  Buckingham  I'll to the king  And from  a mouth of honour  quite cry down  This  Ipswich  The place of Wolsey's nativity  fellow's insolence or proclaim  There's difference in no persons  Norfolk  Be advised  Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot  That it shall singe yourself  We may outrun  By overswiftness that which we run at  And lose by overrunningKnow you not  The fire that mounts the liquor 'till 't run o'er  Seeming to augment but wastes it  Be advised  I say again there is no English soul  More stronger to direct you than yourself  If with the sap of reason you would quench  Or but allay the fire of passion  The character which Norfolk here gives to Buckingham of himself is too common in life Persons whose sense and judgment are sufficiently qualified to direct others but who from the force of passion and indiscretion are rendered incapable of guiding themselves  To advise  and to  be advised  are by no means the  active  and  passive  of the same  verb  as they differ so widely in their  moods  and  tenses  I have made my apology before  Hen VI Part II Act II Scene II The note  for such  jeux de mots  which our Author's stile is apt to lead one into  SCENE IV  There is an excellent lesson for kings given in this place as well as in many other passages of Shakespeare The honour and safety of princes are so much confided to the sense and conduct of their Ministers that such trustees for the State should be ever selected with the nicest judgment and strictest impartiality in which choice virtue should be at least  equally  regarded with talents Were the crown testamentary a sovereign should be circumspect to whose hands he intrusted the government of his people even after his death and how much more solicitous ought he to be with respect to those appointed to rule while his own glory and interest lie so immediately at stake  The great  Condé  complimented  Corneille  's Play of  Cinna  by stiling it  The Breviary of Kings  I think that many of Shakespeare's pieces much better deserve that name But indeed his writings may well  challenge a more general and comprehensive title and be called the  Manual of Mankind  as containing rules and reflections for every state and condition of life throughout the intire compass of human nature from the peasant to the prince  The Council Chamber  The  King  the  Cardinal  and the Nobles seated The  Queen  enters walks up to the foot of the throne and kneels before the  King  in the quality of a suitor    Catharine  I am solicited not by a few  And those of true condition that your subjects  Are in great grievance There have been commissions  Sent down among them which have flawed the heart  Of all their loyalties wherein although  My good lord Cardinal they vent reproaches  Most bitterly on you as putter on  Of these exactions  yet the king our master    Whose honour Heaven shield from soil even  e 'scapes not  Language unmannerly yea such which breaks  The s  des of loyalty and almost appears  In loud rebellion  This makes bold mouths  Tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze  Allegiance in them all their curses now  Live where their prayers did and it's come to pass  That tractable obedience is a slave  To each incensed will I would your highness  Would give it quick consideration for  There is no primer business  But before we close this Scene let us shew our impartiality by suffering the Minister to speak a few words in his own defence which he does very well by urging reflections that have a good deal of truth in them and shew the danger and difficulty of such a station even in the best and ablest hands  Wolsey  If I am traduced by tongues which neither know  My faculties or person yet will be  The chronicles of my doing let me say  'Tis but the fate of place and the rough brake  That virtue must go through We must not stint  Our necessary actions in the fear  To cope malicious censurers which ever  As ravenous fishes do a vessel follow  That is new trimmed but benefit no further  Than vainly longing What we oft do best  By sick interpreters or weak ones is  Not ours or not allowed what worst as oft  Hitting a grosser quality  Quality  for  conception    is cried up  For our best act If we stand still in fear  Our motion will be mocked or carped at  We should take root here where we sit or sit  Statestatues only  SCENE VI  The following Scene must have had an admirable effect at the time of its first representation nor indeed is it passed by even now without applause from the Pit and Galleries where the most rational and virtuous part of our audiences are generally seated though it may perhaps be looked upon but as a remain of our antient barbarism by the Boxes among those who have inadvertently chosen to  stigmatize  themselves by a distinction which accidentally took its rise from the very foible here ridiculed namely persons of  Fashion    An Apartment in the Palace  Enter  Lord Chamberlain  and  Lord Sands  Lord Chamberlain  Is't possible the spells of France should juggle  Men into such strange mysteries  Sands  New customs  Though they be never so ridiculous  Nay let them be unmanly yet are followed  Chamberlain  As far as I see all the good our English  Have got by the last voyage  When Henry the Eighth went to the congress or interview with Francis the First between G  isnes and Ardres with a most sumptuous retinue  is but merely  A fit or two o' th' face  Grimace  but they are shrewd ones  For when they hold 'em you would swear directly  Their very noses had been counsellors  To  Pepin  or  Clotharius  they keep state so  Sands  They've all new legs and lame ones one would take it  That never saw them pace before the spavin  And springhalt reigned among 'em  Chamberlain  Death my lord  Their cloaths are after such a Pagan cut too  That sure they've worn out Christendom  Enter  Sir Thomas Lovell  How now  What news Sir Thomas Lovell  Lovell  Faith my lord  I hear of none but the new proclamation  That's clapped upon the courtgate  Chamberlain  What is't for  Lovell  The reformation of our travelled gallants  That fill the court with  quarrels talk and tailors    Chamberlain  I'm glad 'tis thereNow I would pray our  Monsieurs  To think an  English  courtier may be wise  And never see the  Louvre    Lovell  They must either  For so run the conditions leave those remnants  Of fool and feather that they got in  France    With all their  honourable points of ignorance    Pertaining thereunto as fights and fireworks  Abusing better men than they can be  Out of a foreign wisdom clean renouncing  The faith  hey have in  T  nis  and tall stockings  Short bolstered breeches and such types of travel  And understand again like honest men  Or pack to their old playfellowsThere I take it  They may  cum privilegio  wear away  The lagend of their lewdness and be laughed at  Sands  'Tis time to give them physic their diseases  Are grown so catching  ACT II  SCENE II  Here the unhappy Buckingham in his  last speech  as it may be called just before his execution on recapitulating the vicissitudes and misfortunes of his family makes proper reflections on the indiscretion of placing a confidence in the fidelity of mean dependants  Whether it arises from low birth or base condition of life which are apt to depress the native vigour of the mind and render all its principles and ideas servile and selfish I shall not loiter here to  make an inquisition into it being sufficient to the present argument that the fact itself from the experience of mankind affords us but too much authority to pronounce the truth of the observation  Buckingham  My noble father  Henry  of  Buckingham    Who first raised head against usurping  Richard    Flying for succour to his servant  Banister    Being distressed was by that wretch betrayed  Henry the Eighth life name honour and all  That made me happy at one stroke has taken  For ever from the world  Thus far we are one in fortune both  Fell by our servants  This Duke was betrayed by his surveyor chancellor and confessor  by those men we loved most  A most unnatural and faithless service  Heaven has an end in allYet you that hear me  This from a dying man receive as certain  Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels  Be sure you are not loose those you make friends  And give your hearts to when they once perceive  The least rub in your fortunes fall away  Like water from ye never found again  But where they mean to sink ye All good people  Pray for me I must leave ye the last hour  Of my long weary life is come upon me  Farewel and when you would say something sad  Speak how I fellI've done and God forgive me  I designed to have left off above at the period in the last line but four as the speech ended properly there as far as it related to the argument I had framed upon it but I actually felt myself impressed with somewhat like an idea of impiety to interrupt the speaker before he had concluded his prayerI am sensible of a certain refined pleasure in the sentiment which prompted my pen further on this passage however the  stronger mind  of the Reader may amuse himself at the weakness and superstition of my motive  SCENE VI  The character of Queen Catharine is finely drawn in this Play A becoming demeanour is preserved  throughout every situation and circumstance she is placed in She discovers that dignity and spirit which become the wife and daughter of a king shews the duty and obedience which a husband and a sovereign have a right to claim and speaks on her own part with such a noble confidence as injured innocence may fully warrant One can never be too much assured in a just cause either of their own or of others for whoever defends the rights of the oppressed fights under the banner of Providence  I shall not interrupt the following dialogues as far as they relate to her to point out the passages which may be applied to the several parts of the character above given of her but as in former instances of the same kind in the course of these notes shall leave the Reader to mark and refer them himself as he goes along  BlackFryers  The  King  with his Bishops Nobles c assembled in a Council of Inquest to try the validity of the marriage where  Catharine  appears as summoned on the examination    Crier  Catharine Queen of England come into the court  The  Queen  makes no answer but rising from her seat goes to the king kneels and then speaks  Catharine  Sir I desire you do me right and justice  And to bestow your pity on me for  I am a most poor woman and a stranger  Born out of your dominions having here  No judge indifferent  Impartial  and no more assurance  Of equal friendship and proceeding Alas Sir  In what have I offended you What cause  Hath my behaviour given to your displeasure  That thus you should proceed to put me off  And take your good grace from me Heaven witness  I've been to you a true and humble wife  At all times to your will conformable  Ever in fear to kindle your dislike  Yea subject to your countenance glad or sorry  As I saw it inclined When was the hour  I ever contradicted your desire  Or made it not mine too Which of your friends  Have I not strove to love although I knew  He were mine enemy What friend of mine  That had to him derived your anger did I  Continue in my liking Nay gave not notice  He was from thence discharged Sir call to mind  That I have been your wife in this obedience  Upward of twenty years and have been blest  With many children by you if in the course  And process of this time you can report  And prove it too against mine honour aught  My bond of wedlock or my love and duty  Against your sacred person in God's name  Turn me away and let the foul'st contempt  Shut door upon me and so give me up  To th' sharpest kind of justice Please you Sir  The king your father was reputed for  A prince most prudent of an excellent  And unmatched wit and judgment Ferdinand  My father king of Spain was reckoned one  The wisest prince that there had reigned by many  A year before It is not to be questioned  That they had gathered a wise council to them  Of every realm that did debate this business  Who deemed our marriage lawful Wherefore humbly  Sir I beseech you spare me 'till I may  Be by my friends in Spain advised whose counsel  I will implore If not i' th' name of God  Your pleasure be fulfilled  Rises  Wolsey  You have here lady  And of your choice these reverend fathers men  Of singular integrity and learning  Yea the elect o' th' land who are assembled  To plead your cause It shall be therefore bootless  That longer you defer the court as well  For your own quiet as to rectify  What is unsettled in the king  Campeius  His grace  Hath spoken well and justly therefore madam  It's fit this royal session do proceed  And that without delay their arguments  Be now produced and heard  Catharine  Lord Cardinal  To you I speak  Wolsey  Your pleasure madam  Catharine  Sir  I am about to weep but thinking that  We are a Queen or long have dreamed so certain  The daughter of a king my drops of tears  I'll turn to sparks of fire  Wolsey  Be patient yet  Catharine  I will when you are humbleNay before  Induced by potent circumstances that  You are mine enemy I make my challenge  Challenge  is a law term for persons on their trial objecting to a Juryman  You shall not be my judge For it is you  Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me  Which God's dew quench Therefore I say again  I utterly abhor yea from my soul  Refuse you for my judge whom yet once more  I hold my most malicious foe and think not  At all a friend to truth  Here Wolsey enters into a justification of himself in a long speech which relates not to the present purpose in which he demeans himself with great respect toward the Queen and speaks in his own defence with all seeming moderation and temperTo which she replies  Catharine  My lord my lord  I am a simple woman much too weak  To oppose your cunning You are meek and humblemouthed  You sign  Sign  That is you make an  outward shew  of your holy function  your place and calling in full seeming  With meekness and humility but your heart  Is crammed with arrogancy spleen and pride  You have by fortune and his highness' favours  Gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted  Where powers are your retainers and your words  Domesticks to you serve your will as't please  Yourself pronounce their office  You have arrived at such an height of power that you may do and undo or say and unsay whatever you please without controul  I must tell you  You tender more your person's honour than  Your high profession spiritual that again  I do refuse you for my judge and here  Before ye all appeal unto the Pope  To bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness  And to be judged by him  Here she makes an obeissance to the king and offers to depart the court  Campeius  The queen is obstinate  Stubborn to justice apt to accuse it and  Disdainful to be tried by't'Tis not well  She's going away  Henry  Call her again  Crier  Catharine Queen of England come into the court  Griffith  Madam you are called back  Catharine  What need you note it Pray you keep your way  When you are called returnNow the lord help  They vex me past my patience Pray you pass on  I will not tarryNo nor ever more  Upon this business my appearance make  In any of their courts  Exeunt  Queen  and her Train    ACT III  SCENE I  I shall not prevent the Reader's own feelings and reflections upon this fine and affecting Scene in which the Queen's character is further displayed by any remarks of my own upon the several parts of it  The  Queen's  Apartment    The  Queen  and her Women as at Work  This is an  antiquated  English Scene but has been revived again I hear by Her Majesty in the present reign  Who shines Penelope among  Her chosen female band who ply  The needle's art and fix the flower's perennial dye  BELLAMY Ethic Amusements    Catharine  Take thy lute wench my soul grows sad with troubles  Sing and disperse them if thou can'st leave working  Song  Enter  Groom  of the Chambers    Catharine  How now  Groom  An't please your grace the two great Cardinals  Wait in the presence  Catharine  Would they speak with me  Groom  They willed me say so madam  Catharine  Pray their graces  To come near What can be their business  With me a poor weak woman fallen from favour  Exit  Groom  I do not like their coming Now I think on't  They should be good men their affairs  Affairs  Office profession or calling  are righteous  But all hoods make not monks  A literal translation of the latin proverb  Cucullus non facit monachum      Enter the  Cardinals Wolsey  and  Campeius  Wolsey  Peace to your highness  Catharine  Your graces find me here part of a housewife  I would be all against the worst may happen  What are your pleasures with me reverend lords  Wolsey  May't please you noble madam to withdraw  Into your private chamber we shall give you  The full cause of our coming  Catharine  Speak it here  There's nothing I have done yet o' my conscience  Deserves a corner'Would all other women  Could speak this with as free a soul as I do  My lords I care not so much I am happy  Above a number if my actions  Were tried by every tongue every eye saw them  Envy and base opinion set against 'em  I know my life so even If your business  Do seek me out and that way I am wise in  That is if you are come to examine my title as a wise or my behaviour under that character  Johnson    Out with it boldly Truth loves open dealing  Wolsey  Tanta est erga te mentis integritas Regina serenissima  Catharine  O good my lord no Latin  I am not such a truant since my coming  As not to know the language I have lived in  A strange tongue makes my cause more strange suspicious  Pray speak in English here are some will thank you  If you speak truth for their poor mistress' sake  Believe me she has had much wrong Lord Cardinal  The willing'st sin I ever yet committed  May be absolved in English  Wolsey  Noble lady  I'm sorry my integrity to you  And service to his majesty should breed  I have ventured to transpose some of the words in these two lines in order to render the sense more intelligible  So deep suspicion where all faith was meant  We come not by the way of accusation  To taint that honour every good tongue blesses  Nor to betray you any way to sorrow  You have too much good lady but to know  How you stand minded in the weighty difference  Between the king and you and to deliver  Like free and honest men our just opinions  And comforts to your cause  Campeius  Most honoured madam  My lord of  York  Wolsey was Archbishop of York  out of his noble nature  Zeal and obedience he still bears your grace  Forgetting like a good man your late censure  Both of his truth and him which was too far  Offers as I do in a sign of peace  His service and his counsel  Catharine  To betray me  My lords I thank you both for your good wills  Ye speak like honest men pray God ye prove so  But how to make ye suddenly an answer  In such a point of weight so near mine honour  More near my life I fear with my weak wit  And to such men of gravity and learning  In truth I know not I was set at work  Among my maids full little God knows looking  Either for such men or such business  For her sake that I have been for I feel  The last fit of my greatness good your graces  Let me have time and counsel for my cause  Alas I am a woman friendless hopeless  Wolsey  Madam you wrong the king's love with those fears  Your hopes and friends are infinite  Catharine  In England  But little for my profit can you think lords  That any English man dare give me counsel  Or be a known friend 'gainst his highness' pleasure  Though he be grown so desperate to be honest  And live a subject Nay forsoothMy friends  They that must weigh out  The Ed  tors are at a loss about this expression  To weigh out  certainly means here  to unload  'Tis a mercantile phrase for unfreighting a cargo  my afflictions  They that my trust must grow to live not here  They are as all my comforts are far hence  In my own country lords  Campeius  I would your grace  Would leave your griefs and take my counsel  Catharine  How Sir  Campeius  Put your main cause into the king's protection  He's loving and most gracious 'Twill be much  Both for your honour better and your cause  For if the trial of the law o'ertake you  You'll part away disgraced  Wolsey  He tells you rightly  Catharine  Ye tell me what ye wish for both my ruin  Is this your christian counsel Out upon ye  Heaven is above all yet there sits a Judge  That no king can corrupt  Campeius  Your rage mistakes us  Catharine  The more shame for youHoly men I thought ye  Upon my soul two reverend cardinal virtues  But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear you  Mend them for shame my lords Is this your comfort  The cordial that you bring a wretched lady  A woman lost among ye laughed at scorned  I will not wish you half my miseries  I have more charity But say I warned ye  Take heed take heed for Heaven's sake lest at once  The burden of my sorrows fall upon you  Wolsey  Madam this is a meer distraction  You turn the good we offer into envy  Envy  put for  malice  or  mischief      Catharine  Ye turn me into nothing Woe upon you  And all such false professors Would ye have me  If ye have any justice any pity  If ye be any thing but Churchmen's habits  Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me  Alas h' as banished me his bed already  His love too long ago I'm old my lords  And all the fellowship I hold now with him  Is only my obedience What can happen  To me above this wretchedness All your studies  Make me a curse like this  Campeius  Your fears are worse  Catharine  Have I lived thus longlet me speak myself  Since virtue finds no friends a wife a true one  A woman I dare say without vain glory  Never yet branded with suspicion  Have I with all my full affections  Still met the king loved him next Heaven obeyed him  Almost forgot my prayers to content him  And am I thus rewarded 'Tis not well lords  Bring me a constant woman to her husband  One that ne'er dreamed a joy beyond his pleasure  And to that woman when she has done most  Yet will I add an honour  A great patience    Wolsey  Madam you wander from the good we aim at  Catharine  My lord I dare not make myself so guilty  To give up willingly that noble title  Your master wed me to nothing but death  Shall e'er divorce my dignities  Wolsey  Pray hear me  Catharine  'Would I had never trod this English earth  Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it  Ye've angels' faces but Heaven knows your hearts  What shall become of me now wretched lady  I am the most unhappy woman living  Alas poor wenches where are now your fortunes  To her Women  Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom where no pity  No friends no hope no kindred weep for me  Almost no grave allowed me Like the lily  That once was mistress of the field and flourished  I'll hang my head and perish  Wolsey  If your grace  Could but be brought to know our ends are honest  You'd feel more comfort Why should we good lady  Upon what cause wrong you Alas our places  The way of our profession is against it  We are to cure such sorrows not to sow them  For goodness' sake consider what you do  How you may hurt yourself nay utterly  Grow from the king's acquaintance by this carriage  The hearts of princes kiss obedience  So much they love it but to stubborn spirits  They swell and grow as terrible as storms  I know you have a gentle noble temper  A soul as even as a calm pray think think us  Those we profess peacemakers friends and servants  Campeius  Madam you'll find it so You wrong your virtues  With these weak woman's fears A noble spirit  As yours was put into you ever casts  Such doubts as false coin from it The king loves you  Beware you lose it not for us if you please  To trust us in your business we are ready  To use our utmost studies in your service  Catharine  Do what you will my lords and pray forgive me  If I have used myself unmannerly  You know I am a woman lacking wit  To make a seemly answer to such persons  Pray do my service to his majesty  He has my heart yet and shall have my prayers  While I shall have my life Come reverend fathers  Bestow your counsels on me She now begs  That little thought when she set footing here  She should have bought her dignities so dear  Exeunt  SCENE VI  The present Scene presents us with a second object of compassion which though it interests us after a different manner from the former as neither being so innocent nor suffering so unjustly yet shall I hazard the expression affects us almost as much We do not indeed feel our minds impressed with such a tender sensibility towards the latter as the first but for the honour and dignity of human nature let me say that our commiseration in the second case arises from principles of a nobler kind from our forgiveness of the penitent and our compassion for his misfortunes softened still more by our sorrow for his guilt so that upon the whole the generosity of our sentiment in one instance nearly equals the sympathy of it in the other  The true supputation of the precariousness and instability of all worldly happiness and greatness with the fit temper and resignation to bear their loss are most pathetically and poetically set forth in the following beautiful and affecting scene  Wolsey  in his disgrace    Farewel a long farewel to all my greatness  This is the state of manToday he puts forth  The tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms  And bears his blushing honours thick upon him  The third day comes a frost a killing frost  And when he thinks good easy man full surely  His greatness is a ripening nips his root  And then he falls as I do I have ventured  Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders  These many summers in a sea of glory  But far beyond my depth my highblown pride  At length broke under me and now has left me  Weary and old with service to the mercy  Of a rude stream that must for ever hide me  Vain pomp and glory of this world I hate ye  I feel my heart new openedOh how wretched  Is that poor man that hangs on Princes' favours  There is between that smile we would aspire to  That sweet aspect of princes and our ruin  More pangs and fears than war or women have  And when he fails he falls like Lucifer  Nev  r to h  pe again  Enter  Cromwell  standing amaz  d    Why how now Cromwell  Cromwell  I have no power to speak Sir  Wolsey  What amazed  At my misfortunes Can thy spirit wonder  A great man should decline Nay  if you weep    I'm fallen indeed  Cromwell  How does your grace  Wolsey  Why well  Never so truly happy my good Cromwell  I know myself now and I feel within me  A peace above all earthly dignities  A still and quiet conscienceThe king has cured me  I humbly thank his graceand from these shoulders  These ruined pillars out of pity taken  A load would sink a navy too much honour  O 'tis a burden Cromwell 'tis a burden  Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven  Cromwell  I'm glad your grace has made that right use of it  Wolsey  I hope I have I'm able now methinks  Out of a fortitude of soul I feel  T' endure more miseries and greater far  Than my weakhearted enemies dare offer  What news abroad  Cromwell  The heaviest and the worst  Is your displeasure with the king  Wolsey  God bless him  Cromwell  The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen  Lord Chancellor in your place  Wolsey  That's somewhat sudden  But he's a learned man May he continue  Long in his highness' favour and do justice  For truth's sake and his conscience that his bones  When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings  May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on them  What more  Cromwell  That Cranmer is returned with welcome  Installed Lord Archbishop of Canterbury  Wolsey  That's news indeed  Cromwell  Last that the lady Anne  Whom the king hath in secrecy long married  This day was viewed in open as his queen  Going to chapel and the voice is now  Only about her coronation  Wolsey  There was the weight that pulled me down O Cromwell  The king has gone beyond me all my glories  In that one woman I have lost for ever  No sun shall ever usher forth my honours  Or gild again the noble troops that waited  Upon my smiles Go get thee from me Cromwell  I am a poor fallen man unworthy now  To be thy lord and master Seek the king  That sun I pray may never set I've told him  What and how true thou art he will advance thee  Some little memory of me will stir him  I know his noble nature not to let  Thy hopeful service perish too Good Cromwell  Neglect him not make use now and provide  For thine own future safety  Cromwell  O my lord  Must I then leave you must I needs forego  So good so noble and so true a master  Bear witness all that have not hearts of iron  With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord  The king shall have my service but my prayers  For ever and for ever shall be yours  Wolsey  Cromwell I did not think to shed a tear  In all my miseries but thou hast forced me  Out of thy honest truth to play the woman  Let's dry our eyes and thus far hear me Cromwell  And when I am forgotten as I shall be  And sleep in dull cold marble where no mention  Of me must more be heard say then I taught thee  Say Wolsey that once rode the waves  Rode the waves  instead of  trod the waves  so altered by Warburton to preserve the metaphor pointed out in the two next lines  waves depth shoals  and    of glory  And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour  Found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in  A sure and safe one though thy master missed it  Mark but my fall and that which ruined me  Cromwell I charge thee fling away ambition  By that sin fell the angels how can man then  The image of his Maker hope to win by't  Love thyself last cherish those hearts that wait  Wait  instead of  bate  Warburton A more natural sensible and political sense of the passage  thee  Corruption wins not more than honesty  Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace  To silence envious tongues Be just and fear not  Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's  Thy God's and truth'sThen if thou failest O Cromwell  Thou fallest a blessed martyr Serve the king  And prithee lead me in  There take an inventory of all I have  To the last penny 'Tis the king's My robe  And my integrity to Heaven is all  I dare now call my own O Cromwell Cromwell  "Had I but served my God with half the zeal  "I served my king he would not in mine age  "Have left me naked to mine enemies  This last sentence Wolsey did really speak as recorded in history  "  Cromwell  Good Sir have patience  Wolsey  So I have Farewel  The hopes of Court  my hopes in Heaven do dwell    ACT IV SCENE II  Our first great object before mentioned is here presented to us again to charm us with that truly Christian spirit with which though deeply suffering under the supposed enmity of Wolsey she not only forgives him her injuries but listens to his praise without resentment and even commends his honest Welch encomiast  Kimbolton  Castle  Enter  Catharine  sick and led in between  Griffith  her GentlemanUsher and  Patience  her Woman    Griffith  How does your grace  Catharine  O Griffith sick to death  My legs like loaded branches bow to the earth  Willing to leave their burden Reach a chair  Sonow methinks I feel a little ease  Sitting down  Didst thou not tell me Griffith as thou led'st me  That the great child of honour Cardinal Wolsey  Was dead  Griffith  Yes madam but I think your grace  Out of the pain you suffered gave no ear to it  Catharine  Prithee good Griffith tell me how he died  If well he stept before me happily  For my example  Griffith  Well the voice goes madam  For after the stout earl of Northumberland  Arrested him at York and brought him forward  As a man sorely tainted to his answer  He fell sick suddenly and grew so ill  He could not sit his mule  Catharine  Alas poor man  Griffith  At last with easy roads he came to Lei'ster  Lodged in the abbey where the reverend abbot  With all his convent honourably received him  To whom he gave these words "O father abbot  "An old man broken with the storms of state  "Is come to lay his weary bones among ye  "Give him a little earth for charity  These words are likewise recorded of him  "  So went to bed where eagerly his sickness  Pursued him still and three nights after this  About the hour of eight which he himself  Foretold should be his last full of repentance  Continual meditations tears and sorrows  He gave his honours to the world again  His blessed part to heaven and slept in peace  Catharine  So may he rest his faults lie gently on him  Yet thus far Griffith give me leave to speak him  And yet with charity he was a man  Of an unbounded stomach ever ranking  Himself with princes one that by suggestion  Suggestion  By having the freedom of the king's ear he had an opportunity of suggesting his own schemes and politics into his mind  Tied all the kingdom Simony was fair play  His own opinion was his law I' th' presence  He would say untruths and be ever double  Both in his words and meaning He was never  But where he meant to ruin pitiful  His promises were as he then was mighty  But his performance as he now is nothing  Of his own body he was ill and gave  The clergy ill example  Griffith  Noble madam  Men's evil manners live in brass their virtues  We write in water May it please your highness  To hear me speak his good now  Catharine  Yes good Griffith  I were malicious else  Grif  th  This Cardinal  Though from an humble stock undoubtedly  Was fashioned to much honour from his cradle  This line is thus pointed in the text  Was fashioned to much honour from his crad  e  The alteration I have made in the stop gives the best sense of the passage for Wolsey was a remarkable scholar even in his infancy  He was a scholar and a ripe and good one  Exceeding wise fair spoken and persuading  Lofty and sour to them that loved him not  But to those men that sought him sweet as summer  And though he were unsatisfied in getting  Which was a sin yet in bestowing madam  He was most princely Ever witness for him  Those twins of learning that he raised in you  Ipswich and Oxford One of which fell with him  Unwilling to outlive the good he did it  The other though unfinished yet so famous  So excellent in art and still so rising  That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue  His overthrow heaped happiness upon him  For then and not till then he felt himself  And found the blessedness of being little  And to add greater honours to his age  Than man could give him  he died fearing God    Catharine  After my death I wish no other herald  No other speaker of my living actions  To keep mine honour from corruption  But such an honest chronicler as  Griffith    Whom I most hated living thou hast made me  With thy religious truth and modesty  Now in his ashes honour Peace be with him  Patience  The name of her woman  be near me still and set me lower  I have not long to trouble thee Good Griffith  Cause the musicians play me that sad note  I named my knell whilst I sit meditating  On that celestial harmony I go to    Sad and solemn music and a vision of Cherubims while she sleeps    Here the Reader will please to advert to my remark on the vision in Scene the Fifth of the last Act of the preceding Play This one also was meant by Shakespeare but as an allegorical representation of those beatific dreams or reveries which the virtuous mind and clear conscience may be supposed sometimes to be inspired with  Catharine  waking    Bid the music leave  'Tis harsh and heavy to me  Music ceases  Enter Lord  Capucius  If my sight fail not  You should be lord ambassador from the Emperor  My royal nephew and your name Capucius  Capucius  Madam the same

service to your grace the next  The king's request that I would visit you  Who grieves much for your weakness and by me  Sends you his princely commendations  And heartily intreats you take good

forthAlthough unqueened yet like  A queen and daughter to a king interr me  I can no more  Doctor Johnson has given us his sentiments on this rich and noble passage in the following words  This scene is above any other part of Shakespeare's Tragedies and perhaps above any scene of any other poet tender and pathetic without gods or furies or poisons or precipices without the help of romantic circumstances without improbable sallies of poetical lamentation and without any throes of tumultuous misery  LEAR  Dramatis Personae  MEN  LEAR  ALBANY  KENT  GLOSTER  EDGAR  EDMUND  FOOL  Gentlemen and Attendants  WOMEN  GONERIL  REGAN  CORDELIA  Scene lies in Britain  LEAR  IT may be necessary to many Readers to premise that the Piece here under consideration is the Play as originally written by Shakespeare left the bearing it in mind as altered by  Tate  and generally acted so might occasion confusion or mistakes in the following notes and observations  The Critics are divided in their opinions between the original and the altered copy Some prefer the first as a more general representation of human life where fraud too often succeeds and innocence suffers others prefer the latter as a more moral description of what life should be  But argument in this as in many other cases had better be left quite out of the question for our feelings are often a surer guide than our reason and by this criterion I may venture to pronounce that the reader or spectator will always be better pleased with the happy than the unfortunate catastrophe of innocence and virtue  Besides if Dramatic exhibitions are designed as they certainly should be to recommend virtue and discourage vice there cannot remain the least manner of dispute in our minds whether Shakespeare or Tate have fulfilled Horace's precept of  utile dulci  the best However if  pity  and  terror  as the Critics say are the principal objects of Tragedy surely no Play that ever was written can possibly answer both these ends better than this performance as it stands in the present text  The Reader I hope will not think that I have exceeded the  line  I had prescribed to myself in the conduct of this Work by my hazarding the above criticism as the subject may be still considered as of  a moral nature or tendency and may therefore not improperly be consorted with the rest of my remarks upon this estimable author  ACT I  SCENE I  Kent  and  Gloster  Kent  I thought the king had more affected the duke of  Albany  than  Cornwall    Gloster  It did always seem so to us but now in his division of the kingdom it appears not which of the dukes he values most for qualities are so weighed that curiosity  Curiosity  for  scrutiny    in neither can make choice of either's moiety  This is a fine description of a parent's distributive justice in the division of a fortune between his children Their claims are all equal in nature and should be still preserved so in equity except where particular usages may have obtained or political laws have made a difference in which cases to observe the rule of nature would be a species of injustice  I speak here with regard to conduct of principle only and not of affection for 'tis often impossible for the most virtuous or impartial parent to refrain from loving one child better than another A inndiscriminate regard in any case towards two objects though ever so much alike or estimable is unnatural to the most impartial mind and though our reason should not be able to give a preference our feelings will  The oftdisputed  free will  of man may be sufficiently proved from this innate selfdetermination which his mind possesses We must make a choice even without our being able to make a distinction It must be an ass indeed that can remain in suspence even  between two bundles of hay  But this involuntary election we are not answerable for in  ethics we are accountable only for our manner of acting towards our children in which their moral merits alone can justify superior marks of preference or favour  SCENE II  Lear  And 'tis our fast intent  To shake all cares and business from our age  Conferring them on younger strengths while we  Unburdened crawl toward death  This is a rational a manly and a virtuous purpose But how few are possessed of souls  great  enough to relinquish  greatness  Indeed the rare examples of those who have done so as Charles the Fifth and some others would not encourage one to make the experiment But then it ought to be enquired into whether the instances of abdication had been prompted by any of the principles abovementioned or no for mere fits of devotion or disgust are seldom long or strong enough to support the mind under such a dereliction  Besides habit is a most powerful thing and persons used to occupation of any kind are apt to feel an irksome vacuity and weariness in themselves with an oppressive tediousness of time lying on their hands whenever they cease from employment This has been the confession of all the merchants lawyers farmers and physicians I have ever known or heard of who had retired from their professions or quitted their ordinary scenes of action late in life Whenever therefore such an experiment is attempted it should arise from a  principle  not from a  preference  because the choice must be ventured upon before the comparison can be tried  In the same Scene when Lear requires his three daughters to declare the several portions of their love and respect towards him the eldest addresses herself to him thus  Goneril  Sir  I love you more than words can wield the matter  Dearer than eyesight space and liberty  Beyond what can be valued rich or rare  No less than life with grace health beauty honour  As much as child e'er loved or father found  A love that makes breath poor and speech unable  Beyond all manner of so much I love you  Upon this speech the youngest daughter says to herself aside  What shall Cordelia do Love and be silent  After Goneril has had her portion marked out the second steps forward in order to earn her's  Regan  I'm made of that selfmetal as my sister  And prize me at her worth In my true heart  I find she names my very deed of love  Only she comes too short that I profess  Myself an enemy to all other joys  Which the most precious square of sense possesses  And find I am alone felicitate  In your dear highness love  Here the sincere and unprofessing Cordelia whispers to herself again  Then poor Cordelia  And yet not so since I am sure my love's  More ponderous than my tongue  When Lear has endowed Regan also he next proceeds to challenge Cordelia upon the same question asking her what she has to say to shew her love equal to her sisters her only answer is  Nothing my lord  But indeed what was there left for her to say after such hyperbolical professions as had been just made before her However I dare pronounce that any reader who is at all acquainted with human nature without looking any further into the story beyond the present scene must have already determined the point in his own mind which of the daughter's duties or affections were most to be relied upon  No passion can either bear or justify exaggeration but love alone There the extravagance of transport and the enthusiasm of devotement prove the  luxuriance  of the soil but in every other instance betray the  sterility  of it There is in reality no other passion in the human breast but love All other affections such as avarice duty envy revenge or ambition arise from some foreign sentiment are founded on principle or instigated by vice or pride These we may be educated tempted or provoked to but the former is a spontaneous and involuntary impulse of the soul a certain attractive force that can neither be dictated to us by moral nor restrained by document  First bid physicians preach our veins to temper  And with an argument new set a pulse  Then think of reasoning into love  The REVENGE  SCENE VI  Edmund  solus    Thou Nature art my goddess to thy law  My services are bound wherefore should I  Stand in the plague  The Commentators are not agreed upon the sense of this word in the place where it is here used but I think that the meaning of it would be sufficiently clear if it was exchanged for  tyranny    of custom and permit  The courtesy  By  courtesy  is meant certain  usages  so stiled in the common law of England  of nations to deprive me  Thus do all profligates who deserve to be the outcasts of society betake themselves to the asylum of Nature Whenever the laws of God or man oppose their vices they immediately adopt her for their deity and their legislator whom they cannot fail to find a most indulgent patroness as they are sure to interpret all their own wills and passions to be her unerring dictates  Lucretius the expositor of Epicurus in his unphilosophic poem on the nature of things addresses himself to the same goddess under the appellation of  Venus  whom he makes to precede and supersede the gods representing them as a set of lethargic beings of  her creation and leaving them to doze away their immortalities wrapt up in their empyreal  Pantheon    The pride of man is amazing Rather than acknowledge any Intelligence superior to themselves they chuse to refer the manifest wisdom and power of the Deity to blind chance and inert matter alone  "And call God's providence a lucky hit"  POPE  And yet this can hardly be deemed impious because 'tis so miserably stupid  SCENE VII  Shakespeare as I have had opportunities of observing before takes frequent occasions of representing the horrid condition of a nation under the infliction of a civil war His descriptions deserve to be collected together into one chapter as a document both to prince and people for the warning is equally necessary to each as whatever may be the final event they must be alike sufferers under such a calamity For in such a conflict those are likely to gain most who have the least to lose These reflections refer to the following passage in this Scene  Gloster  Love cools friendship falls off brothers divide In cities mutinies in countries discord in palaces treason and the bond crack'd 'twixt son and father We have seen the best of our time Machinations hollowness treachery and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves  SCENE VIII  The impious and unphilosophic method that people are too generally apt to apply toward the lightening of their consciences and relieving their miseries by imputing their vices and misfortunes to fate necessity or the harmless stars presiding at their births instead of their own wickedness or indiscretions is well satirized and exposed in the following speech though it has not I think been put into a proper mouth to speak  E  mund  This is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune often the surfeits of our own behaviour we  make guilty of our own disasters the sun the moon and stars as if we were villains on necessity fools by heavenly compu  sion knaves thieves and treacherous by spherical predominance drunkards lyars and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting on An admirable evasion of whoremaster man to lay his goatish disposition on the change of a star  SCENE XII  Kent here gives a good character of a man in recommending his own services to Lear  I do profess to be no less than I seem to serve him truly that will put me in trust to love him that is honest to converse with him that is wise and says little to fear judgment  To respect the laws  and to fight when I cannot chuse  Neither forward to begin nor backward to end a fray    SCENE XIII  The following passage comes in here very properly after the foregoing one as it gives good and prudent advice for our conduct in life  Fool  Have more than thou shewest  Speak less than thou knowest  Lend less than thou owest  To owe  in old English is to own or possess    Ride more than thou goest  Learn more than thou trowest  To  trow  is to  believe  The line means not to embrace all opinions because delivered under the sanction of philosophy or learning    Set less than thou throwest  That is never set equal to the stake you throw for    Leave thy drink and thy whore  And keep within door  And thou shalt have more  Than two tens to a score  A phrase for improving one's capital    These maxims should not lose their credit or effect on account of the character which utters them for Shakespeare's fools are not those of  modern times  but speak a great deal of good sense throughout all his Plays Besides these sort of privileged persons stiled formerly  kings' jesters  were usually men of wit and parts a sort of free speakers who were indulged  in a liberty of telling truths or making reflections on their master's conduct without being reprehended or restrained And as they were the only courtiers who were permitted such a licence they deserved more properly to be deemed the  king  's  friends  than to have been stigmatized by either of the other denominations  SCENE XV  The curses which the justly provoked father denounces here against his unnatural daughters are so very horrid and shocking to humanity that I shall not offend my Reader by quoting them though Shakespeare I am convinced supplied them merely in order to raise an abhorrence in his audience against two of the greatest crimes in the black list of deadly sins namely ingratitude and undutifulness and to shew as the injured parent most emphatically expresses it in the same passage  How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is  To have a thankless child  ACT II  SCENE VI  In this same Scene and upon account of Kent's warmth and impatience of speech and temper though still under the disguise of an hireling attendant on Lear there is a very good description given of such a person as he appears to be a character frequently to be met with in life though the speaker is mistaken in the application of it to the honest Duke who might very properly be said in the sense of the expression above given to have been the  King  's  friend    Cornwal  This is some fellow  Who having b  en praised for bluntness doth affect  A saw  y  o  ghn  s and constrains the garb  Quite from his nature He can't flatter he  An honest mind and plain he must speak truth  And they will ta  it soIf not he's plain  These kind of  I know which in this plainness  Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends  Than twenty silly ducking observants  That stretch their duties nicely  SCENE X  When Gloster makes an apology to Lear here for not pressing his son the duke of Cornwal a second time to an interview with him on account of the  fiery quality  of the Duke as also having brought an answer from him that he was not well the injured Monarch resents it thus  Lear  The king would speak with CornwalThe dear father  Would with his daughter speakcommands her service  Are they informed of this My breath and blood  Fiery The fiery duke  Tell the hot duke that  Gloster  offers to go    No but not yetMay be he is not well  Infirmity doth still neglect all office  Whereto our health is bound we're not ourselves  When nature being opprest commands the mind  To suffer with the bodyI'll forbear  And am fall'n out with my more headier will  To take the indisposed and sickly fit  For the sound man  The surprize and resentment expressed in the first part of the above speech is just and natural but the pause of recollection which afterwards abates his anger is extremely fine both in the reasonableness of the reflection and the humanity of the sentiment  This beautiful passage with many others of the same tender kind which follow in the course of developing Lear's character and which I shall occasionally refer back from to this note render this unhappy man a real object both of commiseration and esteem notwithstanding the weakness passion and injustice he has so fully exposed in the beginning of this Play  No writer that ever lived was capable of drawing a mixed character equal to Shakespeare for no one has ever seemed to have dived so deep into  Nature as himselfFrequent instances of this admirable talent in him may be selected from his Works Most other authors in their descriptions of men present us either with  a flowery mead  or  a savage desart  but the  demesne  of human nature which includes both the fruitful field and the barren waste within one inclosure is rarely delineated by common writers  SCENE XII  Lear  to  Goneril  upon her abridging his train    I prithee daughter do not make me mad  I will not trouble theeMy child farewel  We'll no more meet no more see one another  But yet thou art my flesh my blood my daughter  Or rather a disease that's in my flesh  Which I must needs call mine thou art a bile  A plaguesore or imbossed carbuncle  In my corrupted blood But I'll not chide thee  Let shame come when it will I do not call it  I do not bid the thunderbearer shoot  Nor tell tales of thee to highjudging Jove  Mend when thou canstBe better at thy leisure  I can be patient  Here poor Lear seems to make some kind of amends for his former violence for though the provocation continues still the same nay rather indeed is increased by the repetition of it yet he contents himself in this place with barely upbraiding and reviling the offender but refrains from adding curses to his reproaches  Human nature is equally discernible in both these instances The suddenness of his rage on the first injury might have wrested those anathemas from him involuntarily but before the second occasion presented itself his fury had had time to abate and he then restrains his speech within the bounds of a  ustifiable resentment  ACT III  SCENE II  The Fool  Here's a night that pities neither wise men nor fools  He must be very ignorant of human life who does not know that as  the sun shines equally on the just and the unjust  so sickness perils and afflictions are alike the  casual  portion of the good and bad the wise and foolish But then all this happens without the least manner of imputation upon ProvidenceFor this world is not a state of  retribution  And in reality it would be a most uncomfortable reflection if it was for then we could have no reason to presume a fond and flattering hope upon a better  SCENE III  Lear  in the midst of thunder and lightning    Let the great gods  That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads  Find out their enemy nowTremble thou wretch  That hast within thee undivulged crimes  Unwhipt of justice Hide thee thou bloody hand  Thou perjure and thou simular of virtue  That art incestuous Caitiff shake to pieces  That under covert and convenient seeming  H  th practised on man's life Close pentup guilts  Rive your concealing continents and ask  These dreadful summoners grace  Can there be a finer passage or a more admonitory one than this If upon all our dangers or calamities we should enter thus into a strict selfexamination of our consciences and conduct it might naturally produce a most salutary effect on our future lives as on such a scrutiny we should perhaps oftener find our misfortunes to be not our  diseases  but our  medicines  and from thence be brought to say with the Psalmist  Happy has it been for me that I have been afflicted  In the same Scene Lear speaking to the Fool who was appointed to shew him the way to Edgar's hovel where he might be able to shelter himself from the storm says  Where is the straw my fellow  The art of our necessities is strange  That can make vile things precious  The truth of this observation is too obvious from experience to need being insisted on but I shall here add the remainder of the speech as it may be referred to and helps to justify the second paragraph of my remark on the Tenth Scene above in the former Act  Lear  Come your hovel  Poor fool and knave  I've one part in my heart    That's sorry yet for thee  SCENE V  When they have arrived near the hovel Lear changes his purpose on account of a reason he afterwards gives regarding the distracted state of his mind and being pressed by Kent who just then joins him to take shelter from the outrage of the night he cries  Let me alone  And being intreated a second time he repeats the same answer But upon being further urged by the kind earnestness of his poor servant which Kent still preserves the appearance of he then exclaims with emotion  Wilt break my heart  How truly affecting is this short expostulation if quickly conceived It was not the importunity of Kent that he meant to observe upon the expression needed not to have been so tender to have marked such an offence Princes are apt to resent the controlement of their wills or actions in a severer stile But it was the instantaneous comparison between the barbarity of his own daughters which had reduced him to such a wretched condition and the humanity of a common alien kindly pressing him to a shelter from it that so suddenly struck and affected his mind at that momentThis thought indeed might well be said to  break his heart  and to have added a single word more to explain this sentiment would have marred the whole beauty of the passage  Upon Kent's still continuing his entreaty he still refuses to comply but reasons with him thus  Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm  Invades us to the skinSo 'tis to thee  But where the greater malady is fixt  The lesser is scarce feltThou'dst shun a bear  But if thy flight lay toward the roaring sea  Thou'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth When the mind's free  The body's delicateThe tempest in my mind  Doth from my senses take all feeling else  Save what beats there  This is the true nature of the human mind the greater evil always swallowing up the lesser as the rod of Moses did the other serpents And in great calamities I do not know but it might perhaps be an advantage to have some other ills of an inferior nature to combat with at the same time for as Lear says just after as his reason for refusing to take shelter  This tempest will not give me leave to ponder  On things would hurt me more  When he consents at last to enter the hut he presses his two attendants to go in first saying  I'll pray and then I'll sleep  Upon which he immediately falls into the following beautiful apostrophe  You houseless poverty  Poor naked wretches wheresoe'er you are  That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm  How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides  Your looped and windowed raggedness defend you  From seasons such as these  O I have ta'en  Too little care of thisTake physic Pomp  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel  That thou may'st shake the super  ux to them  And shew the Heavens more just  Here also I shall beg leave to refer the Reader back to the second paragraph of my remark on the Tenth Scene of the Second Act  This puts me in mind of two good lines on the same subject which I met with in a very pretty little moral Poem lately published  By Miss More of Bristol    Ask what we have to giveit is not ours  Heaven has but lent it us to make it yours  SCENE IX  Edgar  When we our betters see bearing our woes  We scarcely think our miseries our foes  Who alone suffers suffers most i' th' mind  Leaving free things and happy shows behind  States of life free from distress and likely to continue so    But then the mind much suff'rance does o'erskip  When grief hath mates and bearing fellowship  How light and portable my pain seems now  When that which makes me bend makes the king bow  He utters this reflection upon considering the comparative distresses to which Lear had been reduced and his observation being drawn both from nature and the immediate object then before him has a double beauty and force in this place and should be remembered and applied in all such cases Let us compare our own ills with those of others especially of persons who from their superior rank and fortune may be supposed to be better defended from injury than ourselves and it may conduce to render our minds often more acquiescent in our own sufferings  ACT IV  SCENE I  Edgar  Yet better thus and known to be contemned  Than still contemned and flattered To be worst  The lowest most dejected thing of fortune  Stands still in esperance lives not in fear  The lamentable change is from the best  The worst returns to laughter  Shakespeare gives us here a poetical paraphrase on the flattering old English proverb that  when things are at the worst they'll mend  He has commenced the speech with a noble and liberal sentiment  and concludes it with a reflection drawn from the adage in these lines  World world O world  But that thy strange mutations make us wait  Wait  instead of  hate    Theobald  thee  Life would not yield to age  That is If the vicissitudes of life did not suffer us to amuse our sufferings still with hope few would have patience enough to wait 'till old age should bring its slow relief to all our cares  Enter  Gloster  blind and led by an old Man    Old Man  You cannot see your way  Gloster  I have no way and therefore want no eyes  I stumbled when I saw Full oft 'tis seen  Our maims  Maims  instead of  mean    Johnson  secure us and our mere defects  Prove our commodities  This is a truth often verified in life but the most general instances are that women and children are safer from harms than men areThey hazard less from being less able to achieve  Gloster  As flies to wanton boys are we to the Gods  They kill us for their sport  This is a most impious and unphilosophic reflection Poor Gloster seems by this expression to have been rather soured than softened by his misfortunes which his attempted suicide afterwards proves still further Such a sentiment must certainly surprize us in Shakespeare when uttered by a person of so good a character as GlosterIt could not so offend in the mouth of Edmund though better not spoken at all  Gloster  when he has given his purse to the guide    Heavens deal so still  Let the superfluous  Superfluous  for  superabundant    and lustdieted man  That braves  Braves  instead of  slaves    Warburton  your ordinance that will not see  Because he does dot feel feel your power quickly  So distribution should undo excess  And each man have enough  Lear had before given us the same moral as taken notice of in my remark on the Fifth Scene of the former Act but I have quoted this passage notwithstanding as containing a sentiment which cannot be too often inculcated Offer it as a  proposition  and all the world will agree with you in the  precept  but make it a  proposal  and how few will join issue in the  practice  SCENE II  Albany  and  Goneril  When this good Duke is reproaching his wife here for the barbarous treatment she had given her father she interrupts him with  No more'Tis foolish  To which he replies very justly  Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile  Filths savour but themselves  It is indeed too much the horrid nature of vice and folly not only to rejoice in its own wickedness and weakness but as Albany says to depreciate all wisdom and goodness in others The Moor would have all faces black  He says further on in the same speech  If that the Heavens do not their visible spirits  Send quickly down to tame these vile offences  Humanity must perforce prey on itself  Like monsters of the deep  This sentiment was as emphatically expressed before on the close of the last Scene of the former Act by two mean attendants who were witnesses to the cruelties exercised by Cornwal and Regan on Gloster's eyes but I forbore to quote it 'till I came to this passage  Manent  two Servants    First Servant  I'll never care what wickedness I do  If this man come to good  Second Servant  If she live long  And in the end meet the old course of death  Women will all turn monsters  But to return again to the Scene with Albany and Goneril  She replies to his humane remonstrances and just reproaches in these words  Milklivered man  That bear'st a cheek for blows a head for wrongs  Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning  Thine honour from thy suffering that not know'st  Fools do those villains pity who are punished  Ere they have done their mischief  On which Albany exclaims  See thyself devil  Proper deformity seems not in the fiend  So horrid as in woman  Diabolical qualities appear not so horrid in the Devil to whom they properly belong as in woman to whom they are unnatural  Warburton    What she means by the last lines is that it is necessary to guard against foreseen evils as well as to defend against those that press us but fools being too shortsighted to see the prevention in the punishment are apt to bewail the sufferer  SCENE III  Kent  and a  Gentleman  The honest old  king  's  friend  having sent off this person with dispatches to Cordelia then Queen of France importing the miserable situation of her father questions him here on his return what kind of effect the perusal of his letter had upon her and nothing surely can be more beautiful nor more interesting than the description he gives of that fine struggle between patience and sorrow which she manifested upon this occasion with the delicacy and  decency of her quick retiring from view when she found her grief beginning to master her philosophic seemings  Kent  Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief  Gentleman  Ay Sir she took them read them in my presence  And now and then an ample tear trilled down  Her delicate cheek it seemed she was a queen  Over her passion which most rebellike  Sought to be king o'er her  Kent  O then it moved her  Gentleman  Not to a rage Patience and sorrow strove  Who should express her goodliest you have seen  Sun shine and rain at onceHer smiles and tears  Were like a wetter May Those happy smiles  That played on her ripe lip seemed not to know  What guests were in her eyes which parted thence  As pearls from diamonds droptIn brief  Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved  If all could so become it  Part of the above description resembles what Viola says in TwelfthNight  She sat like patience on a monument  Smiling at grief    Kent  Made she no verbal question  Gentleman  Yes once or twice she heaved the name of Father  Pantingly forth as if it press'd her heart  Cried sisters sisters shame of ladies sisters  Kent father sisters What i' th' storm i' th' night  Let pity ne'er believe itThere she shook  The holy water from her heavenly eyes  And clamourmotioned  Motioned  instead of  moistened    Warburton  then away she started  To deal with grief alone  Theobald hints that Shakespeare had borrowed this fine picture of Cordelia's grief from Joseph  in Holy Writ  who being no longer able to restrain his affections ordered his retinue from his presence and then wept aloud  SCENE VII  The adulation and hyperbolical flattery which princes are too generally  abused  by is well exposed here  Lear  They flattered me like a dog and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were thereTo say ay and  no to every thing that I saidAy and no too was no good divinityWhen the rain came to wet me once and the wind to make me chatter when the thunder would not peace at my bidding there I found them there I smelt them out Go to they are not men of their wordsThey told me I was every thing 'tis a lie I am not agueproof  The great Canute took a method of reproving the sycophants of his court who affected to treat him as a God by standing on the beach till the sea surrounded him notwithstanding his stern behest to the tide to arrest its course  SCENE VIII  A person here who has been witness to one of the Scenes of Lear's madness makes this very natural reflection  A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch  Past speaking of in a king  Strict philosophy perhaps may not admit of such a distinction in men merely from the difference of outward circumstances alone but the habits and opinions of the world will always operate both on our sentiments and feelings on a comparison to the full extent of the maxim here laid down  Besides indeed without having the least manner of respect to persons that superior degree of calamity which can be capable of piercing through the stronger shields of station opulence and power before it can inflict its arrows upon princes must doubtless render them still greater objects of commiseration than those whose condition in life may be supposed to lye more open to the ordinary assails of misfortune See my remark upon the last Scene of the former Act  Gloster seems to have the same sense of things when in the following Scene he expresses a surprize that because Lear is disordered in his senses he should still be able to retain his own though indeed he makes but a sad deduction from the reflection  The king is mad how stiff is my vile sense  That I stand up and have ingenious feeling  Of my huge sorrows Better I were distract  So should my thoughts be severed from my griefs  And woes by wrong imagination lose  The knowledge of themselves  SCENE IX  When Edgar by killing of Goneril's steward gets possession of the dispatches he was carrying to the enemy he takes a resolution to open them which he prefaces thus  By your leave gentle wax and mannersBlame us not  To know our enemies minds we rip their hearts  Their papers are more lawful  But however certain  reasons of State  may possibly render such an action necessary there is something in it notwithstanding at which the liberal and ingenuous mind naturally revolts  Beyond the fixed and settled rules c  The comparison he makes indeed is certainly strong in favour of the lesser evil regarding merely the simple position of the question but then he should have restrained himself to the saying the latter was more  reasonable  or  humane  than have pronounced it to be more  lawful  For it is this very circumstance the  legality  of the former Act which marks the difference between them and which though severe yet being founded on the maxims of the  CivilLaw  that  no person shall be convict of a crime without his own confession  Shaftesbury makes  ridicule  and the Civil Law as wisely makes  torture  the  est of Truth    appears to be more justifiable in the constitution of things than even a milder act which has no such principle to support it nay which rather militates as in this case it apparently does against that very maxim by obtaining a surreptitious proof of guilt  without confession  besides the compassing it by an ungenerous baseness  SCENE X  The following speech is replete with filial tenderness as well as excess if that can possibly be of humanity  Cordelia  speaking to her father while he sleeps    Had you not been their father  That is had you been even an alien or a stranger  these white flakes  Did challenge pity of them Was this a face  To be exposed against the warring winds  To stand against the deep dreadbolted thunder  In the most terrible and nimble stroke  Of quick cross lightning To watch poor  Perdu    With this thin helm  My very enemy's dog  Though he had bit me should have stood that night  Against my fire  And wast thou fain poor father  To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn  In short and musty straw Alack alack  'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once  Had not concluded  ACT V  SCENE I  There is a noble and a just maxim delivered in the following speech though not indeed very consonant with the profligate notions of antient barbarism commonly called heroism  Albany  to  Edmund  Sir this I hear the king is come to his daughter  To Cordelia    With other whom the rigour of our state  Forced to cry out  Where I could not be honest    I never yet was valiant  SCENE V  When Lear and Cordelia are brought in prisoners the latter asks if they may not be permitted to a conference with  these daughters and these sisters  in hopes of working on their compassion to set them freeTo which Lear answers with that mixture of extravagance and sound sense which so obviously run through the whole of his delirium  No no no no Come let's away to prison  We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage  When thou dost ask me blessing I'll kneel down  And ask of thee forgiveness so we'll live  And pray and sing and tell old tales and laugh  At gilded butterflies and hear poor rogues  Talk of court news and we'll talk with them too  Who loses and who wins who's in who's out  And take upon's the mystery of things  As if we were God's spies And we'll wear out  In a walled prison packs and sets  Sets  instead of  sects    Johnson  of great ones  That ebb and flow by th' moon  In the above speech besides the wildness of the first part which is however extremely affecting for passion moves us more than reason there is here as in all this poor king's rhapsodies as hinted before  a document in madness  which excellently describes the character of the old  Quid Nunc's  so well ridiculed in the Spectator indeed of the Coffeehouse Politicians of all times and which well rebukes the idle presumption of those vain ignorants who pretend to canvass the mysteries of state and investigate the arcana of government as if they were of a superior order of intelligence without any knowledge in the science of civil polity or the least capacity for the arts of empire  Such intermeddlers by working themselves in to be the demagogues of the populace have often perplexed councils and sometimes overthrown kingdoms For as it is the  Few  who govern in all states their strength must necessar  ly be founded more in  authority  than  force  and when once rule or royalty have been rendered the objects of general diffidence or contempt what curb is there left to restrain the  Many  Slaves and fools then  Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench  And minister in their steads  TIMON  SCENE VI  A respect for regality supported by a just claim is ever so strongly impressed in the general bosom  of a people that rebels never think they can sufficiently secure themselves against it From whence the common saying that  princes seldom remove from a prison but to a grave  This thought is well expressed in the following speech  Edmund  to  Albany  who commands him to deliver up his prisoners    Sir I thought it fit  To send the old and miserable king  To some retention and appointed guard  Whose age has charms in it whose title more  To pluck the common bosoms on his side  And turn our imprest lances in our eyes  Which do command them  SCENE VIII  After Edgar has wounded and vanquished Edmund he makes the following reflection  The gods are just and of our  several  I have ventured to make a slight alteration here because the word  pleasant  in the Text had no relation to the speech as far as I have quoted it besides that the expression I have substituted renders the maxim more general  vices  Make instruments to scourge us  There have been such frequent instances in life of the above observation that those vices which we have most indulged ourselves in have become the peculiar means of our chastisement that it might naturally lead us into a belief that this may possibl  be one among the many secret ways of Providence with its creatures  At least the  adaptions  have often been so very extraordinary and remarkable that it might tempt one to suppose there must have been something more than the common casualty or contingency of events in such cases I could wish however for the sake of morals to encourage the persuasion and render it universal  Albany Edgar  and  Edmund  Edgar  giving an account of his last interview with his father    Never O fault revealed myself to him  Until some half hour past when I was armed  Not sure though hoping of this good success  I asked his blessing and from first to last  Told him my pilgrimage But his flawed heart  Alack too weak the conflict to support  'Twixt two extremes of passion joy and grief  Burst smilingly  Edmund  Speak you on  You look as you had something more to say  Albany  If there be more more woeful hold it in  For I am almost ready to dissolve  Hearing of this  Edgar  This would have seemed a period But such  As love to amplify another's sorrow  To much would add much more  And top extremity  The T  has been altered here by Doctor Warburton much to the advantage of its  ense and perspicuity    The difference of natures between Albany a man of virtue and consequently of a compassionate disposition and Edmund a vicious person and of course of blunted feelings is well marked in the above dialogue The latter would have the sad story continued but the former intreated to hear no more of it And Edgar has well observed upon these opposed characters in the preface he makes to the second part of his tale  This would have seemed a period c  SCENE IX  The same Albany however immediately after upon seeing the dead bodies of Goneril and Regan brought in says  This judgment of the Heavens that makes us tremble  Touches us not with pity  Here a hasty Reader might be apt to think  hat the good Duke had forfeited his character for h  manity a little in this instance but there is something inimitably just and fine in the passage We certainly feel ourselves differently affected towards the wretched in the common lot of life and  those who seem to be distinguished as the more immediate objects of divine chastisement Our minds in the latter case become impressed with a sort of pious awe which restrains our compassion lest the too free indulgence of it might seem to arraign the justice of Providence  This is a trait of human nature so very little obvious to common capacities that though all must have been sensible of the feeling so few have had penetration enough to investigate the cause that I dare say many have been ashamed to confess it as imputing it to a deficiency of tenderness in their own hearts  SCENE X  This Play concludes with the following most excellent moral  Albany  All friends shall taste  The wages of their virtue and all foes  The cup of their deservings  It were a consummation devoutly to be wished  that the examples of this precept were more numerous in the world than they are'Tis a peculiar reproach to the character which utters it when they are not  Albany was a king  See my last reflection upon Henry V  TIMON  Dramatis Personae  MEN  TIMON  ALCIBIADES

upon their patrons lessens the value of praise to the deserving few We will admit a lover to compliment his mistress beyond her merits because he may be supposed from the blindness of his passion not to intend any exaggeration as has been already taken notice of on a passage in the preceding Play  See Lear Act I Scene II The last remark on Cordelia's answer  But in every other such case we sin with our eyes open and thereby offend against that great and universal moral which ought to be the principal rule both of our words our thoughts and our actions namely  Truth    In the continuance of the same Scene in a dialogue between the Poet and a Painter the former ketches out the plan of a moral or didactic Poem  e was then composing for the warning and instruction of his great patron the Lord Timon in which there is much merit both in the design and contrivance of the piece as well as in the description of it  Poet  I have in this rough work shaped out a man  Whom this beneath world

speech in the above dialogue well describes the general and truly moral satire and properly distinguishes it from the bastard or invidious kind of personal invective stiled the libel or lampoon  My free drift  Halts not  particularly  c"  SCENE II  Timon upon hearing of his friend Ventidius being thrown into a gaol says to the messenger  Commend me to him I will send his ransom  And being enfranchised bid him come to me  'Tis not enough to help the feeble up  But to support him after  The last lines contain a noble sentiment of friendship charity and generosityIt has merit enough in itself to stand alone but would have double the effect on an hearer if pronounced by a person of a more prudent and provident character  This thought is beautifully expressed in an old Elegy written on the good bishop Boulter who died Primate of Ireland some years ago  He thought it mean  Only to help the poor to beg again  Timon says soon after in the same dialogue  This gentleman of mine hath served me long  To build his fortune I will strain a little  For 'tis a bond in men  And again in Scene V for I chuse to collect like sentiments under the same head he says to  Ventidius who comes to thank him for his friendship and to repay the debt  You mistake my love  I gave it freely ever  and there's none  Can truly say he gives if he receives  But to return to our former SceneWhen Timon asks the old Athenian whether his daughter likes the young man that courts her he replies  She is young and apt  Our own precedent passions do instruct us  What levity's in youth  This is a sensible and philosophic reflection and should be more attended to than it generally is for there are no persons fit to educate to guide or instruct young people but those who have not forgotten their own youth Parents and grandparents are apt too often to require their children and grandchildren should benefit of their earned knowledge and long experience and so go on from thence improving still in sense and virtue It would be a happy thing indeed if we could put morals on the foot of science which is thus progressive but they must be very ignorant of human nature who expect it  "Old folks" as an ingenious modern author expresses it  would have young ones as  wise  as themselves without considering that they must be  fools  if they were so  The Friends or Original Letters Vol II Letter LXXIX    Meaning for he does not stay to explain himself that they must be persons of dull phlegmatic natures without passions without sensibility and consequently incapable of improvement or virtue  Whenever I have happened to observe what are called  the virtues of age  to be innate in youth I have naturally expected to meet with the vices of it there also and have but rarely found any one of such character uninfected with selfishness or avarice  When Timon receives a portrait from the Painter he makes a satirical reflection upon it which tho' too just in itself seems to be a good deal out of character in him at that time as being previous to the experience which soon after might have instructed him to have made it  The painting is almost the natural man  For since dishonour trafficks with man's nature  He is but outside penciled figures are  Even such as they give out  SCENE III  Apemantus on seeing and hearing much embracing and professing between Timon and Alcibiades mutters thus to himself  That there should be small love amongst these sweet knaves and all this courtesy The strain of man is bred out into baboon and monkey  Sterne said of French politeness that  it might be compared to a smooth coin it had lost all mark of character  To which I think we may add that courtesy like counters by having attained a currency in the world have come at length to bear an equal rate we might say a superior one with pieces of intrinsic value so that one who should make a difference between them in the  modern  traffic of life would be looked upon as a mere  virtuoso  who preferred an  Otho  to a  Georgius    We must take up with the world at present as we do with the stage to which it has so often been compared There is  a fable  in both and if the actors but perform their  personated characters  well we are not to quarrel with them for not exhibiting their  natural ones    SCENE V  The noble Timon being rendered uneasy at the too servile deferences paid him by his clients justly says  Nay ceremony was but devised at first  To set a gloss on faint deeds hollow welcomes  Recanting goodness sorry ere 'tis shewn  But where there is true friendship there needs none  There is a parallel thought in the Merchant of Venice taken notice of before in my last remark on that Play  Further on in this Scene there occurs a passage which well deserves to be quoted but needs no note  Timon Lucius  and others    Lucius  Might we but have the happiness my lord that you would once use our hearts whereby we might express some part of our zeals we should think ourselves for ever perfect  That is arrived at the perfection of happiness    Timon  O no doubt my good friends but the gods themselves have provided that I should have much help from you how had you been my friends else Why have you that charitable title from thousands did I not chiefly belong to your hearts  The sense of this passage in the original text is made clearer by an alteration of Doctor Johnson's  I have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf And thus far I confirm you Oh ye gods think I what need we have any friends if we should never have need of them They would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their sounds to themselves Why I have oft wished myself poorer that I might come nearer to you We are born to do benefits And what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends O what a precious comfort 'tis to have so many like brothers commanding one another's fortunes O joy e'en made away ere 't can be born Mine eyes cannot hold water  SCENE VII  Apemantus  Oh that men's ears should be  To counsel deaf but not to flattery  It is indeed an unhappy reflection to think how few examples there are in life to controvert this maxim If the first were not the case there would be no such thing as the latter for men would then  deserve the praise  they get  ACT II  SCENE I  The following speech may serve to hint a common truth that all gifts or presents from inferiors  may be considered but as petitions to their superiors  Senator  If I want gold steal but a beggar's dog  And give it Timon why the dog coins gold  If I would sell my horse and buy ten more  Better than he why give my horse to Timon  Ask nothing give it him it foals me straight  Ten able horse  SCENE IV  The honest and anxious steward of Timon makes a reflection here which the experience of all times hath too fully vouched  Flavius  Heavens have I said the bounty of this lord  How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants  This night englutted Who now is not Timon's  What heart head sword force means but is lord Timon's  Great Timon's noble worthy royal Timon's  Ah when the means are gone that buy this praise  The breath is gone whereof this praise is made  Feastwon feastlost one cloud of winter showers  These flies are couched  Couched  smothered    SCENE V  When the reduced and unhappy Timon finds himself involved in poverty and distress he directs his steward to call upon the Body of the Senators who had shared his bounties for its assistance in this exigence in answer to which the steward acquaints him that he had taken the liberty to do this already upon his own prior knowledge in the situation of his affairs The account he then proceeds to give of the reception his application had met with among these  shadows  of friendship is such I am sorry to say as those who have ever been under a necessity of making the same experiment will readily acknowledge to be genuine Faint expressions of good will with a strong reproof for extravagances which they themselves had both encouraged and partaken of and finally closed with an absolute denial of relief  Flavius  They answer in a joint and corporate voice  That now they are at fall want treasure cannot  Do what they would are sorryYou are honourable  But yet they could have wishedThey know not  Something hath been amissA noble nature  May catch a wrenchWould all were well'Tis pity  And so intending  Intending  for  attending to    other serious matters  After distasteful looks and these hard fractions  Fractions of speech  as  you are honourablethey could have wished'tis pity  c    With certain halfcaps and coldmoving nods  They froze me into silence  To which Timon replies with a competent knowledge of human nature for he seems to be inspired here as before  See the last passage of Scene II of the former Act with the remark upon it    These old fellows  Have their ingratitude in them hereditary  By  hereditary  he means naturally or connate with old age    Their blood is caked is cold it seldom flows  'Tis lack of friendly warmth they are not kind  And nature as it grows again tow'rd earth  Is fashioned for the journey dull and heavy  After having thrown out this stricture against Age and Avarice he desires his steward to apply to Ventidius a young man lately come into the possession of a large fortune whom he had just redeemed from the miseries of a gaol and restrains him only to borrow from him the exact sum he had before paid for his release saying  Ne'er speak or think  That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink  To which the more experienced steward replies to himself  Would I could not That thought is bounty's foe  Being free itself it thinks all others so  The same sentiment is well expressed by Zanga in the description he gives of his conqueror  Is not Alonzo rather brave than cautious  Honest than subtle  above fraud himself    Slow therefore to suspect it in another  The REVENGE  ACT III  SCENE I  When Ventidius has declined to lend his assistance though this circumstance is only hinted at but not produced upon the scene Timon dispatches the steward  In the text this person's name is  Flaminius  but I have not here distinguished him from  Flavius  to avoid a confusion of persons under the same character of steward  to Lucullus another young man of promising hopes who answers in the same strain with the evasive and sarcastical reply given before by the Senators as related in the Fifth Scene of the preceding Act pleading incapacity and reprehending the too profuse liberality of Timon After which he forces some pieces into Flavius's hand by way of bribing him to pretend to his master that he had not met with him and then goes off Upon which the honest and indignant steward flinging away the money cries out  May these add to the number that may scald thee  Let molten coin be thy damnation  Thou disease of a friend and not himself  Has friendship such a faint and milky heart  It turns  Turns  alluding to milk's growing sour  in less than two nights O ye gods  I feel my master's passion This slave  Unto this hour has my lord's meat in him  Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment  When he is turned himself to poison  O may diseases only work upon it  And when he's sick to death let not that part  Of nurture my lord paid for be of power  To expel sickness but prolong his hour  The generous and feeling mind must naturally sympathize with the warmth of resentment here expressed though its moral and charity may refrain it from concurring in the anathemas of it  I cannot quit this scene till I have remarked upon the character of Ventidius as represented by two seeming contradictory circumstances in the first and second Acts  In the former he shews his honesty and gratitude to his benefactor by offering to repay the money which had been given to redeem his liberty  Scene V of the Play but only hinted at here in one of the excursions from Scene II by way of introducing Timon's fine reply to the offer  and here he betrays the very reverse of these principles Is Shakespeare inconsistent No 'Tis nature still Ventidius had just then succeeded to an ample patrimony A sudden afflux of fortune especially to a person newly emerging from distress is apt to swell and enlarge the heart at first but then in mean minds it is as apt to shrink and contract it as suddenly again  SCENE II  Enter  Lucius  and three Strangers    That disingenuous nature in mankind which prompts to censure those vices in others which themselves are capable of is well exposed here  When the first stranger has mentioned the forlorn state of Timon's fortunes and related the story of Lucullus's unkindness towards him Lucius exclaims with surprize  What a strange case was that Now before the gods I am ashamed on't Denied that honourable man There was very little honour shewn in that For my own part I must needs confess I have received some small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels and such like trifles nothing comparing to his yet had he not mistook him and sent to me  The sense is corrected here by Doctor Johnson's alteration of the text in a note  I should ne'er have denied his occasions so many talents  But immediately after in the same scene upon application made to himself by Servilius to the same purpose he thus defends his purse  What a wicked  Wicked  for  unlucky    beast was I  speaking to the messenger  to disfurnish myself against so good a time when I might have shewn myself honourable How unluckily it happened that I should purchase the day before for a little dirt  Dirt  instead of  pa  t  Theobald  and undo a great deal of honour Servilius now before the gods I am not able to doThe  more beast I sayI was sending to use lord Timon myself these gentlemen can witness but I would not for the wealth of Athens I had done it now Commend me bountifully to his good lordship and I hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me because I have no power to be kind And tell him this from me I count it one of my greatest afflictions that I cannot pleasure such an honourable gentleman Good Servilius will you befriend me so far as to use my own words to him  Then turning to the first stranger he says what is too generally experienced through life  True as you said Timon is shrunk indeed  And he that's once denied will hardly speed  Upon Lucius and Servilius's going out the following dialogue is held between the remaining persons in which some  scandalum magnatums  are thrown out against the dignity of human nature  First Stranger  Do you observe this Hostilius  Second Stranger  Ay too well  First Stranger  Why this is the world's soul  And just of the same piece is ev'ry flatterer's spirit  Who can call him his friend  That dips in the same dish for in my knowing  Timon has been this lord's father  And kept his credit with his purse  Supported his estate nay Timon's money  Has paid his men their wages He ne'er drinks  But Timon's silver treads upon his lip  And yet oh see the monstrousness of man  When he looks out in an ungrateful shape  He does deny him in respect of his  In respect of his  of Lucius's fortune    What charitable men afford to beggars  Third Stranger  Religion groans at it  First Stranger  For mine own part  I never tasted Timon in my life  Nor any of his bounties came o'er me  To mark me for his friend yet I protest  For his right noble mind illustrious virtue  And honourable carriage  Had his necessity made use of me  I would have put my wealth into partition  Partition  substituted for  donation  Hanmer    And the best half should have attorned  Attorned  instead of  returned    Warburton  to him  So much I love his heartBut I perceive  Men now must learn with pity to dispense  For policy  Poli  y  for  selfishness    sits above conscience  This latter speech savours too much of the former one of Lucius and as the Queen says in Hamlet  the gentleman doth profess too much  but we shall charitably accept it as sincere since the speaker's virtue has not been put to the proof  SCENE III  Sempronius another of Timon's  friends  is here assailed who evades the request by pleading surprize that he should be the first person applied to on such an exigence before Lucius Lucullus and Ventidius who had each of them so much higher obligations to his services than himself But being beaten out of that argument by being informed of their all having been before  touched and found base metal  as the messenger tells him he then makes use of a device not uncommon in such cases to pretend a quarrel or affect a jealousy with a person in order to have one's resentment pass as an excuse for refusing the favour required  Sempronius  How denied him  Ventidius Lucullus Lucius all denied him  And does he send to me Three Hum  It shews but little love or judgment in him  ust I be his last refuge His friends like physicians  Thrice  Thrice  instead of  thrive    Johnson  give him overMust I take th' cure upon me  H' has much disgraced me in'tI'm angry at him  He might have known my place I see no sense for't  But his occasions might have wooed me first  For in my conscience I was the first man  That e'er received gift from him  And does he think so backwardly of me  That I'll requite it last No  So it may prove an argument of laughter  To th' rest and I 'mongst lords be thought a fool  I'd rather than the worth of thrice the sum  He had sent to me first but for my mind's sake  I'd such a courage  Courage  for  heart  or  good will    then to do him good  But now return  And with their faint reply this answer join  Who 'bates mine honour shall not know my coin  When Sempronius retires the servant who had brought the message to him makes some reflections which with many other instances of the same kind in these writings shew that Shakespeare was as prodigal of his wit and sentiment as Timon was of his favour and fortune for he often squanders them both upon clowns and lacqueys  Servant  Excellent your lordship's a goodly villain The Devil knew what he did when he made man politic  Politic  again for  selfish  See note last but two  He crossed  Crossed  for  blessed  himself in the Romish sense of the word  himself by't and I cannot think but that in the end the villanies of man will set him clear  Set him clear  Leave him no longer chargeable with the crime of tempting them  How fairly this lord strives to appear foul takes virtuous copies to be wicked  By pretending a pique of honour and a generous resentment at not having been first applied to  Like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire  Alluding to religious wars    Of such a nature is his politic  Politic  encore in the same sense  love  This was my lord's best hope now all are fled  Save the gods only  I have transposed these words for the sake of the measure In the text they stand thus  Save only the gods      SCENE IV  Another  sentimental footman  sent by one of Timon's creditors to press him for his debt speaks the following couplet the last line of which deserves to be made an adage of  I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealt    And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth  SCENE VI  Alcibiades pleading before the Senate for the life of a friend who had killed his antagonist in  a fair rencounter thus addresses himself to the court  Health honour and  compassion  to the Senate  I am an humble suitor to your virtues  For pity is the virtue of the law  And none but tyrants use it cruelly  Our author is always most remarkably strong in his expression and rich in his argument upon the subject of this divine attribute of Mercy Witness Portia's speech in the Merchant of Venice Isabella's in Measure for Measure and several other passages of the same kind throughout his writings To make  pity the virtue of the law  is a fine idea and a beautiful expression  The argument for and against the practice of Duelling is here very philosophically urged on one side and as artfully evaded on the other  S  nator  You undergo  Undergo  for  undertake    too strict a paradox  Striving to make an ugly deed look fair  Your words have took such pains as if they laboured  To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling  Upon the head of valour which indeed  Is valour misbegot and came into the world  When sects and factions were but newly born  He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer  The worst that man can breathe and make his wrongs  His outsides wear them like his raiment carelessly  And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart  To bring it into danger  If wrongs be evils and inforce us kill  What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill  Alcibiades  My lord  Senator  You cannot make gross sins look clear  It is not valour to revenge but bear  Alcibiades  My lords then under favour pardon me  I  I speak like a captain  Why do  end men expose themselves to battle  And not endure all threatenings sleep upon't  And let the foes quietly cut their throats  Without repugnancy But if there be  Such valour in the bearing what make we  Abroad Why then sure women are more valiant  That stay at home  If bearing carry it then is the ass  More captain than the lion and the felon  Loaden with irons wiser than the judge  If wisdom be in suffering  The text has been much improved in this latter part by Doctor Johnson    I shall submit this difficult punctilio of honour  Duelling  to the decision of my male Readers for as a woman I cannot be supposed to be a competent judge of it However I shall venture to proceed so far as to observe that as this piece of antient chivalry is said to have been originally instituted for our defence I must confess I think it should have rested there  Alcibiades then concludes the above speech by petitioning again for mercy  Oh my lords  As you are great be pitifully good  Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood  To kill I grant is sin's extremest gust  But in defence by mercy 'tis most just  To be in anger is impiety  But who is man that is not angry  Weigh but the crime with this  SCENE VII  When Timon meets his late delinquent friends at the mock banquet he had prepared and pressed them to he makes a just sarcasm as well as a justly provoked one upon the insincerity of their professions  Senator  The swallow follows not summer more willingly than we your lordship  Timon  aside  Nor more willingly leaves winterSuch summerbirds are men  He again carries on the same strain in the first part of the grace he pronounces before the covers are taken off  Timon  The gods require our thanks  You great benefactors sprinkle our society with thankfulness For your own gifts make yourselves praised but reserve still to give lest your deities be despised Lend to each man enough that one  need not lend to another for were your godheads to borrow of men men would forsake the gods  When the dishes are exposed filled only with warm water he thus expresses his resentment in just description and apt epithets for such guests  May you a better feast never behold  You knot of mouthfriends smoke and lukewarm water  Is your perfection  That is your perfect resemblance  This is Timon's last  Who stuck and spangled you with flatteries  Flatteries  for  bounties  or  favours      Washes it off and sprinkles in your faces  Your reeking villainy Live loathed and long  Most smiling smooth detested parasites  Courteous destroyers affable wolves meek bears  You fools of fortune trencherfriends timeflies  Summer insects    Cap and knee slaves vapours and minutejacks  Machines of motion which require frequent winding up or a phrase framed for timeservers    ACT IV  SCENE II  In this Scene another of Timon's servants or rather  one of Shakespeare  's  See my note following Sempronius's speech in Scene III of the foregoing Act  delivers himself most affectionately and affectingly upon the unhappy condition of his master  As we do turn our backs  From our companion thrown into his grave  So his familiars from his buried fortunes  Slink all away leave their false vows with him  Like empty purses pick'd and his poor self  A dedicated beggar to the air  With his disease of allshunned poverty  Walks like contempt alone  SCENE III  There are so many unfavourable pictures of the world already given by Shakespeare that though each of them may be very proper in its respective place to adorn the fable and maintain the characters in the several Dramas yet some of them it may be thought might be spared in a work of this general  kind which requires not such minute attentions but as my scope here is not only to instruct the ignorant to warn the unwary and inculcate the moral of our author both from his precepts and examples but to do him honour also as a writer I think it would be a sort of injustice in me to suffer any passage in him to remain unnoted which besides conducing to such great ends may serve to shew the fecundity of his powers and genius which has enabled him to treat the same subject in so many different ways with still new thoughts and varied expression  The following speech is a beautiful instance of this observation  Timon  Twinned brothers of one womb  Whose procreation residence and birth  Scarce is dividant touch with several fortunes  The greater scorns the lesser Not even nature  To whom all sores lay siege can bear great fortune  But by contempt of nature  This sentence is obscure It means that men tho' conscious of the imperfection of human nature when puffed up by fortune will despise others for their common imperfections as if they were themselves exempt from them    Raise me this beggar and denude  Denude  strip or deprive him of his possessions  that lord  The senator shall bear contempt hereditary  He uses the word  hereditary  here with the same latitude he has done before See note th on Scene V of Second Act In this place it means that contempt is the usual portion or patrimony of poverty    The beggar native  Native  is used in the same sense with  hereditary  as above explained  honour  It is the pasture lards the wether's sides  The want that makes him lean  The text has been cleared of its difficulty and much improved in its sense in this passage by Doctor Warburton  Who dares who dares  In purity of manhood stand upright  And say This man's a flatterer If one be  So are they all for every greeze  Greeze  step or degree  of fortune  Is smoothed by that below The learned pate  Ducks to the golden fool All is oblique  There's nothing level in our cursed natures  But direct villainy  In the Sixth Scene following he exclaims against the world again  But myself  Who had the world as my confectionary  The mouths the tongues the eyes the hearts of men  At duty more than I could frame employments  That numberless upon me stuck as leaves  Do on the oak have with one winter's brush  Fallen from their boughs and left me open bare  For every storm that blows  But to return At the end of the former speech upon finding gold while he was digging for roots he says  Thus much  Of this will make black white fair foul wrong right  Base noble old young coward valiant  You gods why thisthis you gods why this  Will lug your priests and votaries from your sides  Pluck stout men's pillows from beneath their heads  Kill them before their time for the sake of their wealth    This yellow slave  Will knit and break religions bless th' accursed  Make the hoar leprosy adored place thieves  And give them title knee and approbation  With senators on the bench this is it  That makes the mourning  The word in the text is  wappened  but the Commentators not agreeing about the sense of the expression I have ventured to substitute one that needs no explanation  widow wed again  Come damned earth  Thou common whore of mankind that putt'st odds  Among the rout of nations I will make thee  Do thy right nature  Lie hid in the bowels of the earth where kind Providence meant to conceal thee    Burying it  And again in the Sixth Scene of this Act looking on the gold he renews the same reflections  O thou sweet kingkiller and dear divorce  'Twixt natural son  This adjective is meant in the liberal sense of the word not the legal one  and sire thou bright defiler  Of Hymen's purest bed thou valiant Mars  Thou ever young fresh loved and delicate wooer  Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow  That lies on Dian's lap  What a beautiful and poetical passage is here both in the imagery and the expression  thou visible god  That solderest close impossibilities  And mak'st them kiss that speak'st with ev'ry tongue  To ev'ry purpose O thou touch of hearts  Think thy slave man rebels and by thy virtue  Set them into confounding odds that beasts  May have the world in empire  I have suffered these last lines to pass as they seem as well to continue the enumeration of the fatal effects of avarice as to denounce a curse against it  SCENE IV  When Alcibiades meets with Timon wild in the woods he asks with concern and surprize  How came the noble Timon to this change  To which he severely replies but in Shakespeare's usual sport of fancy even on the most serious subjects  As the moon does by wanting light to give  But then renew I could not like the moon  There were no suns to borrow of  Alcibiades  I've heard in some sort of thy miseries  Timon  Thou saw'st them when I had prosperity  And in the next Scene in an invocation to the earth he says  Dry up thy marrows vines and ploughtorn leas  Whereof ingrateful man with lickerish draughts  And morsels unctuous greases his pure mind  That from it all consideration slips  SCENE VI  Here also are some more strictures thrown out  contra mundum  with which I shall conclude this Act  Timon  and  Apemantus  Apemantus  What man didst thou ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means  Timon  Who without those means thou talk'st of didst thou ever know beloved  ACT V  SCENE I  Flavius the good steward upon seeing his master sitting before the mouth of his cave makes the following fond and pathetic exclamation succeeded by  reflections in the same stile with those which mostly fill this Play  Oh ye gods  Is yon despised and ruinous man my lord  Full of decay and failing  Oh monument and wonder of good deeds  Evilly bestowed  What change of honour desperate want has made  What viler thing upon the earth than friends  Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends  How rarely  Rarely  for  fitly    does it meet with this time's guise  When man was wished to love his enemies  Grant I may ever love and rather woo  Those that  would  mischief me than those that  do  This passage is difficult Doctor Warburton has altered the text to accommodate it to his explanation and Doctor Johnson has restored it The meaning of it as it here stands is that  open enemies  are less dangerous than  false friends  We can shield ourselves from the  ne but are prisoners at discretion with the other Mr J  hnson quotes a Spanish proverb to the same effect "Defend me "from my friends and from my enemi  I will defend myself"  SCENE II  Here also in the same strain our Author proceeds When two of Timon's former sycophants upon hearing that their patron is suddenly become rich again are going together to cajole him as before they hold the following dialogue with each other  Poet  and  Painter  Poet  What have you now to present unto him  Painter  Nothing at this time but my visitation only I will promise him an excellent piece  Poet  I must serve him so too tell him of an intent that's coming toward him  Painter  Good as the best Promising is the very air of the time it opens the eyes of expectation Performance is ever the duller for his act and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people the deed is quite out of use To promise is most courtly and fashionable performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it  Poet  I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him It must be a personating  Personating    of his own situation and circumstances  of himself a satire against the softness of prosperity with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency  Nay let's seek him  Then do we sin against our own estate  When we may profit meet and come too late  Painter  True  While the day serves before blackcornered night  Find what thou want'st by free and offered light  Timon overhearing their conversation from behind his cave casts out another invective against gold and concludes his speech with an expression which I have also let pass for the reason beforementioned in the last note on Scene III of the former Act For though used in the form of a curse it may however be hardly considered in that light as 'tis but the natural consequence of the vice and is no more than to say  May the man who swallows poison die  which he certainly will do  Timon  What a god's gold that he is worshipped  In baser temples than where swine do feed  'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam  Settlest admired reverence in a slave  To thee be worship and thy saints for aye  Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey  I shall here conclude my remarks upon this Play with Dr Johnson's character of it as far as the fable has any relation to moral  The catastrophe says he affords a very powerful warning against that ostentatious liberality which scatters bounty but confers no benefit and buys flattery but not friendship  TITUS ANDRONICUS  Dramatis Personae  MEN  TITUS ANDRONICUS a noble Roman General against the Goths  MARCUS ANDRONICUS his brother and a Tribune of the People  BASSIANUS second Son of the late Emperor  WOMEN  TAMORA Queen of the Goths a Captive  TITUS ANDRONICUS  IT has been much disputed among the Commentators whether this Play be originally Shakespeare's or only the work of some elder Author revised and improved for representation by him though if I might be allowed to venture a criticism upon this subject I should suppose the intire Piece to be his and for a very singular reason Because the whole of the fable as well as the conduct of it is so very  barbarous  in every sense of the word that I think however he might have been tempted to make use of the legend in some hurry or other for his own purpose he could hardly have adopted it from any other person's composition We are quicksighted to the faults of others though purblind to our own Besides he would never have strewed such sweet flowers upon a  caput mortuum  if some child of his had not lain entombed underneath Many of the beauties I hint at being merely poetical imagery without any mixture of moral in them are therefore not inserted among the following notes as not being the proper object of my remarks which must in consequence appear to fall short of the above compliment  The arguments  pro  and  con  for the authenticity of this Play are not material to our present purpose for as we find it among the musterroll of our Author's forces it challenges a right to pass in review along with the rest though there are but very few passages in it to answer the design of this work  I should imagine from the many shocking spectacles exhibited in this Play that it could never have been represented on any theatre except the  Lisbon scaffold where the duke d'Aveiro the Marquis of Tavora  cum suis  were so barbarously massacred for the supposed Jesuits' plot against the present king of Portugal And yet Ben Johnson assures us that it was performed in his time  with great applause  and we are also told that it was revived again in the reign of Charles the Second  with the same success  The different humours and tastes of times It would be not only hissed but driven off the stage at present  ACT I  SCENE II  Tamora queen of the Goths and a captive pleading here to Titus Andronicus for her son's life who was going to be offered up as a victim of war speaks in Shakespeare's usual stile as remarked before  See Timon Act III Scene VI the first remark  on the great article of mercy  Would'st thou draw near the nature of the gods  Draw near them in being merciful  Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge  There is something so soothing to the mind in a description of the sequestered Scene free from the tumult the vices and the violences of the world that it naturally pleases us even though the grave itself be made the subject of it  I affirm that I was sensible of such a feeling myself on reading the following passage in this Scene though without the least manner of disgust to life all the while  Titus Andronicus  On the interment of his sons  In peace and honour rest you here my sons  Rome's readiest champions repose you here  Secure from worldly chances and mishaps  Here lurks no treason here no envy swells  Here grow no damned grudges here no storms  No noise but silence and eternal sleep  SCENE III  When Bassianus applies to Titus for his interest in support of his election to the Roman empire he says  My faction  This innocent word is not to be understood here in the common acceptation of it Shakespeare uses it simply to denote any party in a state  if thou strengthen with thy friends  I will most thankful beAnd thanks to men  Of noble minds is honourable meed  There is something truly great in the above sentiment and shews the speaker of it worthy of being an emperor A grateful heart is all that Heaven itself requires for its numerous blessings and mercies toward us  ACT III SCENE IV  Marcus Andronicus endeavouring to repress his brother Titus's excess of grief who was labouring under the most unheard of cruelties and misery both in himself and his children addresses him thus  Oh brother speak with possibilities  And do not break into these deep extremes  To which Titus replies  Is not my sorrow deep having no bottom  Then be my passions bottomless with them  Marcus  But yet let reason govern thy lament  Titus  If there were reason for these miseries  Then into limits could I bind my woes  When Heaven doth weep doth not the earth o'erflow  If the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad  Threat'ning the welkin with his bigswoln face  And wilt thou have a reason for this coil  Then give me leave for losers will have leave  To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues  Titus in this speech says a great deal to excuse the shews and expressions of grief though in too  poetical a stile rather for so sad a subject but I think the first argument of it a very strong one upon this occasion  If there were reason for these miseries c  For we certainly suffer those misfortunes which happen to our lot in the common course of nature or of justice with much more resignation of mind than we can do those which are inflicted on us by the violences of tyranny cruelty or maliceHere our detestation and abhorrence of the agent serves to heighten our resentment of the injury  In the two last lines above Shakespeare has given an elevation to the common expression of  losers have leave to speak  There are instances of the same kind in our Author before taken notice of This is one of his characteristics and indeed I think that his stile and manner are so strongly marked throughout this Play take the above speech for one instance  The whole of it for I have transcribed it short  that I own it surprizes me Doctor Johnson should say  he did not think Shakespeare's touches discernible in it  In the same Scene when some shocking objects of his wretchedness are presented to the view of Titus he makes a very natural reflection upon them for a person in such unhappy circumstances  Ah that this sight should make so deep a wound  And yet detested life not shrink thereat  That ever death should let life bear his name  Where life hath no more interest than to breathe  In the extremities of anguish either of mind or body we are apt to be surprised at that toughness in our frame which prevents its dissolution and are often tempted to wish our miseries might of themselves have sufficient force to bring us that relief which our virtue or religion forbids us to supply ourselves  MACBETH  Dramatis Personae  MEN  MACBETH  DUNCAN  MACDUFF  BANQUO  MALCOLM  ROSSE  CATHNESS  ANGUS  DOCTOR  OLD MAN  WOMEN  LADY MACBETH  LADY MACDUFF  MACBETH  ACT I  SCENE V  anquo  BUT 'tis strange  And oftentimes to win us to our harm  The instruments of darkness tell us truths  Win us with honest trifles to betray us  In deepest consequence  From this speech may be deduced the nature of temptation to evil which by suggesting some immediate pleasure or profit prompts us on to unhappy consequences  SCENE VI  The following description of the death of a brave man after he has made a peace with his conscience by contrition is a fine one  Malcolm  speaking to the King of the execution of the Thane of  Cawdor  Very frankly he confessed his treasons  Implored your highness' pardon and set forth  A deep repentanceNothing in his life  Became him like the leaving it He died  As one that had been studied  Who had frequently philosophised upon it  in his death  To throw away the dearest thing he owed  Owed  for  owned      As 'twere a careless trifle  The bravery of spirit which so many persons both antient and modern have manifested in this great and last article of their lives seems to argue something more in human nature  than mere animal existence    The specious appearances of men by which the ingenuous and unwary are liable to be deceived in  their commerce with the world are marked and lamented by Duncan in this Scene where speaking of the abovementioned rebel he says  There is no art  To find the mind's construction  Natural disposition  in the face  He was a gentleman on whom I built  An absolute trust  Momus well wished a window in every man's breast Physiognomists pretend they can take a peep through the features of the face but this is too abstruse a science to answer the general purposes of life besides that education may render such knowledge doubtful as in the case of Socrates The diseases or unsoundness of the body are generally visible in the countenance and complexion of the invalid how infinitely more useful would it be if the vices of the mind were as obvious there It is not necessary in the first case because the patient can tell his disorder but in the other instance  the infected person is dumb    O heaven that such resemblance of the Highest  Should yet remain where faith and realty  Remain not  MILTON  See the last remark upon Twelfth Night  SCENE IX  Macbeth in his meditations on the murder of Duncan has some fine and just reflections on the nature of conscience  If it were  done  when 'tis done then 'twere well  It were done quicklyIf th' assassination  Could trammel up the consequence and catch  With its success surcease  Success surcease  These two words were reversed in the original but prop  rly transposed by Theobald  that but this blow  Might be the beall and the endall  here    But  here  upon this bank and shoal of time  We'd jump the life to comeBut in these cases  We still have judgment  here  that we but teach  Bloody instructions which being taught return  To plague th' inventor this evenhanded justice  Commends  Commends  for  returns    the ingredients of our poison'd chalice  To our own lips  SCENE X  And in this Scene when Lady Macbeth upbraids her husband with cowardice for not being more determined on the purpose of the murder he makes the following noble reflection  Prithee peace  I dare do all that may become a man  Who dares do more is none  Doctor Johnson very justly says  That these lines ought to bestow immortality on the Author though all his other productions had been lost  ACT II  SCENE II  AgainThe horrors of a guilty mind are strongly and finely painted in the following speech The images of our crimes not only haunt us in our dreams but often become the visions of our waking thoughts All the bars that Providence could oppose to vice it has set against it It could no more without depriving man of his freewill and so rendering him equally incapable of merit or blame  Macbeth  going to commit the murder    Is this a dagger which I see before me  The handle toward my hand Come let me clutch thee  I have thee not and yet I see thee still  Art thou not fatal vision sensible  To feeling as to sight Or art thou but  A dagger of the mind a false creation  Proceeding from the heatoppressed brain  I see thee yet in form as palpable  As that which now I draw  Thou marshal'st me the way that I was going  And such an instrument I was to use  Mine eyes are made the fools o' th' other senses  Or else worth all the restI see thee still  And on the blade o' th' dudgeon gouts  Gouts drops  from  goute  French  of blood  Which was not so beforeThere's no such thing  It is the bloody business which informs  Thus to mine eyes  The remainder of this speech is worth quoting both on account of the fine poetical imagery it contains and in order to shew the strong terror which guilt had impressed on his mind by his invoking even inanimate matter not to inform against him  Now o'er one half the world  Nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse  The curtained sleep now Witchcraft celebrates  Pale Hecate's offerings and withered Murder  Alarum'd by his centinel the wolf  The wolf and all wild beasts go out to prowl at midnight    Whose howl's his watch thus with his stealthy pace  Like Tarquin's theft  Alluding to a Poem of our Author's on the story of Tarquin and Lucrece where he describes his stealing to her chamber in the dead of night  And in Cymbeline he makes Jachimo say  Our Tarquin thus  Did softly press the rushes ere he wakened  The chastity he wounded  Act II Scene II  gliding tow'rd his design  The Commentators have disagreed about the original line in this place I do not think any of them have sufficiently squared the sense to the expression The liberty I have ventured to take with it has at least rendered the passage intelligible    Moves like a ghostThou sound and firmset earth  Hear not my steps which way they walk for fear  Thy very stones prate of my whereabout  And take the present horror from the time  The  horror  he means is the  dread silence  that would be interrupted by the exclamation of the stones which his terror makes him here suppose possible    Which now suits with it  SCENE III  Lady Macbeth speaking here of Duncan's grooms says  That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold  What hath quenched them hath given me fire  Our sex is obliged to Shakespeare for this passage He seems to think that a woman could not be rendered compleatly wicked without some degree of intoxication  It required two vices in her one to intend and another to perpetrate the crime He does not give  wine and wassail  Wassail  An antient beverage of ale apples and honey mixed  to Macbeth leaving him in his natural state to be actuated by the temptation of ambition alone  Macbeth after he had committed the murder speaking of the Grooms who lay in the antechamber he had just passed through says  One cried  God bless us  and  Amen  the other  As they had seen me with these hangman's hands  List'ning their fearI could not say  Amen    When they did say  God bless us    But wherefore could I not pronounce  Amen  I had most need of blessing yet  Amen  Stuck in my throat  This is naturalOne of the most horrid circumstances of guilt is that total suppression a wicked person is apt to labour under for a time of the ability to pray I should think that from this very extraordinary circumstance Divines might deduce a good argument to strengthen the Christian system of theology If as the advocates for Natural Religion say our vices proceed from the violence of our passions merely contrition upon their scheme might immediately succeed the gratification of our purpose but as we are taught that temptation arises from the instigation of an evil spirit the fiend has still a further interest in the postponing of our repentance Suicide must certainly be a strong instance of this latter doctrine as it prompts us even contrary to the intent of nature and the general scope both of our affections impressions and feelings to the destruction of our own existence  Macbeth  Methought I heard a voice cry  sleep no more  Macbeth doth murder sleep  The innocent sleep  Sleep that knits up the ravelled sleeve  A loose skein of silk Doctor Seward  of care  The birth  Instead of  death    Warburton  of each day's life sore labour's bath  Balm of hurt minds great Nature's second course  Chief nourisher in life's feast  In the first part of my remark on the second Scene above I have observed upon the impressions that a disturbed mind is apt to stamp on our dreams and sight This passage adds our sense of hearing also to the testimony of our conscience  Toward the latter end of this Scene there is another hint given to the same admonitory purpose  Macbeth  Whence is that knocking  Starting  How is't with me when every noise appals me  What hands are here Hah they pluck out mine eyes  I continued the quotation of the last speech above but one to the end of it in order to treat my Reader with the beautiful description of sleep there given by our Author And again at the latter end of the Fifth Scene of the Third Act Lady Macbeth says to her husband  You lack  the season of all Nature  sleep  The expression here is not only poetical but philosophical also for the vegetable world requires sleep or rest as well as the animal one  SCENE IV  Macbeth  The labour we delight in physicks pain  This expression is very just in general but more particularly so in the present case supposed respecting the offices of friendship and good will How pleasant how easy is duty when inspirited by affection  ACT III  SCENE II  The awe with which a bad man though ever so valiant is naturally impressed by the superiority  which virtue gives another brave man is well depicted here  Macbeth  To be thus is nothing  But to be safely thusOur fears in Banquo  Stick deep and in his royalty of nature  Reigns that which would be feared 'Tis much he dares  And to that dauntless temper of his mind  He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour  To act in safety There is none but he  Whose being I do fear and under him  My genius is rebuked  The text adds the allusion here  as Anthony  's  was by Caesar  which Doctor Johnson very judiciously rejects as spurious I agree with himI do not think it is in Shakespeare's stileThe passage is too warm and immediate to admit of so cold and remote an image Besides this is a soliloquy and the speaker needed not to have explained his meaning to himself supposing the expression of  rebuked  had a reference to that idea  The general causes which render men desperate arising from necessities or vices are here set forth  First Murderer  I am one  Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world  Have so incensed that I am reckless  Heedless or careless  what  I do to spite it  Second Murderer  And I another  So weary of disastrous tuggs with Fortune  This line is altered for the better by Warburton    That I would set my life on any chance  To mend it or be rid on't  SCENE III  The wretched condition of a mind not only labouring under the sense of guilt but dreading the immediate chastisement of it is more strongly  painted in this Scene than any where else in Shakespeare  Lady  Macbeth  sola  Nought's had all's spent  Where our desires are got without content  'Tis safer to be that which we destroy  Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy  Enter  Macbeth  How now my lord why do you keep alone  Of sorriest fancies your companions making  Using those thoughts which should indeed have died  With them they think on Things without all remedy  Should be without regardWhat's done is done  Macbeth  We have scotched  To  scotch  is to cut across to slash or wound  the snake not killed it  She'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice  Remains in danger of her former tooth  But let both worlds disjoint and all things suffer  Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep  In the affliction of these terrible dreams  That shake us nightlyBetter be with the dead  Whom we to gain our place have sent to peace  Than on the torture of the mind to lie  In restless extasy  Extasy  Any strong perturbation or distraction of the mind may be so called though the word is seldom used by any other writer but as an expression of pleasure or joy  Duncan is in his grave  After life's fitful fever he sleeps well  Treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison  Malice domestic foreign levy nothing  Can touch him further  See my second remark on Scene II Act I of the former Play    O full of scorpions is my mind dear wife  SCENE V  The true spirit of hospitality is well described in the following expostulation from Lady Macbeth to her husband upon his neglect of the guests▪  My royal lord  You do not give the cheer the feast is sold  That is not often vouched while 'tis making  'Tis given with welcomeTo feed were best at home  From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony  Meeting were bare without it  In the same Scene Macbeth speaking in soliloquy upon the appearance of Banquo's ghost expresses a common notion which however cannot be too strongly inculcated in the mind of man as whatever tends to the service of religion or virtue ceases to be weakness or superstition though perhaps strict philosophy may not assist to support it  It will have bloodThey say blood will have blood  Stones have been known to move and trees to speak  See last line but two of the last speech in Scene II of the former Act    Augurs that understand relations have  By magpies and by choughs  Choughs  seagulls  and rooks brought forth  The secret'st man of blood  SCENE VI  Hecate delivers a truth here which would better have become a more moral speaker But Shakespeare can  Gather honey from the weed  And make a moral of the Devil himself  HEN V  After having mentioned the magic arts by which she is drawing on Macbeth to his destruction she adds  He shall spurn fate scorn death and bear  His hopes 'bove wisdom grace and fear  And you all know  security  Is mortal's chiefest enemy  ACT IV  SCENE II  Macbeth upon hearing that Macduff had escaped from his design against his life by flying into England makes a reflection which though wickedly applied in the present case may notwithstanding if it is allowable to extract medicine from poison  or gather honey from the weed  be considered  as a good general rule of action in all enterprises of moment  Time thou anticipat'st  Anticipate  for  prevent    my dread exploits  The flighty purpose never is o'ertook  Unless the deed go with it From this moment  The very firstlings of my heart shall be  The firstlings of my hand And even now  To crown my thoughts with acts be't thought and done  The castle of Macduff I will surprize  Seize upon  Fife  give to the edge o' th' sword  His wife his babes and all unfortunate souls  That trace him in his lineNo boasting like a fool  This deed I'll do before this purpose cool  It was a saying of Charles the Fifth  That we should deliberate under  Saturn  but execute under  Mercury    SCENE III  In the following dialogue the Reader will meet with many just natural and prudent reflections too obvious to need any comment though perhaps those urged by Lady Macduff are carried a little too far in the present exigence  Lady Macduff  and  Rosse  Lady Macduff  speaking of her husband's flight  What had he done to make him fly the land  Rosse  You must have patience madam  Lady Macduff  He had none  His flight was madness when our actions do not  Our fears do make us traitors  Our laws put the same construction upon itFlight is taken to imply a tacit confession of guilt and whenever this is the case it is always made one of the articles of the ind  ctment that the person charged with a fact had  fled for the same      Rosse  You know not  Whether it was his wisdom or his fear  Lady Macduff  Wisdom To leave his wife to leave his babes  His mansion and his titles in a place  From whence himself does flyHe loves us not  He wants the natural touch for the poor wren  The most diminutive of birds will fight  Her young ones in her nest against the owl  See a parallel passage before quoted in these remarks  "Unreasonable  Unreasonable  for  irrational    creatures feed their young c  Henry VI Part III Act II Scene III    All is the fear and nothing is the love  As little is the wisdom where the flight  So runs against all reason  Rosse  My dearest cousin  I pray you school yourself but for your husband  He's noble wise judicious and best knows  The fits o' th' season I dare not speak much further  I take my leave of you  Shall not be long but I'll be here again  Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward  To what they were before  But when Lady Macduff is warned herself to fly she begins at first to reason upon the proposition as she had before done on her husband's flight by pleading the security of her innocence but it becoming now  her own case  she quickly falls into a more prudent and rational manner of argument upon the subjectThis is Nature  Whither  Whither  for  wherefore    should I fly  I've done no harm But I remember now  I'm in this earthly world where to do harm  Is often laudable to do good sometime  Accounted dangerous folly Why then alas  Do I put up that womanly defence  To say I'd done no harm  SCENE IV  The different natures of men shewn in the same circumstances and situations are well discriminated here  Malcolm  and  Macduff  Malcolm  Let us seek out some desolate shade and there  Weep our sad bosoms empty  Macduff  Let us rather  Hold fast the mortal sword and like good men  Bestride our downfall'n birthdame  Stand over and defend our country from its enemies Doctor Johnson has supplied the hint of  birthdame  instead of  birthdoom  which had no meaning  Each new morn  New widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows  Strike Heaven on the face  Assault echo  that it resounds  As if it felt with Scotland and yelled out  Like syllables of dolor  Malcolm betrays the same timidity of spirit still further in the continuation of this dialogue in refusing to trust his person with Macduff though he supports his apprehensions however upon very reasonable grounds of diffidence  What I believe I'll wail  What know believe and what I can redress  As I shall find the time to friend I will  What you have spoke it may be so perchance  This tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues  Was once thought honest you have loved him well  He hath not touched you yet I'm young but something  You may deserve of him through me and wisdom  And you might think it wisdom  Shakespeare often sets grammar at defiance His text seldom needs improvement though it sometimes requires explanation  To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb  T' appease an angry God  Macduff  I am not treacherous  Malcolm  But Macbeth is  A good and virtuous nature may recoil  In an imperial charge  The influence of kings may be too strong for virtue  I crave your pardon  That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose  Transpose  Alter the nature of    Angels are bright still though the brightest fell  Though all things foul should bear the brows of grace  Yet grace must look still so  If you be honest my suspicions touch you not Appearances may deceive for virtue can wear no garb but what hypocrisy can assume    Macduff  I've lost my hopes  Malcolm  Perchance even there where I did find my doubts  Why in that rawness  Rawness  Unadvisedly and unprovidedly  left you wife and children  Those precious motives those strong knots of love  Without leavetaking I pray you  Let not my jealousies be your dishonours  But mine own safeties You may be rightly just  Whatever I shall think  Further on he makes an admirable enumeration of those qualities which a good prince ought to be principally possessed of  Malcolm  The kingbecoming graces  As justice verity temperance stableness  Bounty persev'rance mercy lowliness  Devotion patience courage fortitude  This indeed is to be a king whose first subjects should be his own appetites and passions  SCENE VI  Here follows a true but melancholy description of a people suffering under a state of anarchy and civil war The reader has met with many passages of the same kind quoted in this work before  Macduff Malcolm  and  Rosse  just arrived in  England  Malcolm  to  Rosse  Stands Scotland where it did  Rosse  Alas poor country  Almost afraid to know itself It cannot  Be called our mother but our grave where nothing  But who knows nothing is once seen to smile  Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air  Are made not mark'd where violent sorrow seems  A modern extacy  Alluding to the grimace of the Fanatics Warburton  the dead man's knell  Is there scarce ask'd for whom and good men's lives  Expire before the flowers in their caps  Dying or ere they sicken  Macduff  Oh relation  Too nice and yet too true  Malcolm  What's the newest grief  Rosse  That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker  For telling an  old story      Each minute teems a new one  In the same dialogue when Rosse has given Macduff an account of the murder of his wife and children at which he seems to stand petrified with sorrow Malcolm justly warns him of the dangerous  consequences of restraining the natural shews and expressions of grief  Malcolm  Merciful Heaven  What man Ne'er pull your hat upon your brows  Give sorrow words the grief that does not speak  Whispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break  Dispute it like a man  To which Macduff as justly replies without any disgrace to philosophy or religion  I shall do so  But I must feel it as a man  I cannot but remember such things were  That were most precious to me  But he then proceeds to a reflection which though natural and common for the unhappy to make in such circumstances offends against both the principles abovementioned philosophy and religion as being at once impious and unjust  Did Heaven look on  And would not take their part  Lear on seeing Cordelia dead makes an expostulation of the same sort  Why should a dog a horse a rat have life  And thou no breath at all  In the last Scene of the Play    But all this arises from a too presumptuous and overweening notion of our own consequence in the creation The pride of man prompts each to consider himself as the principal object of Providence and we would all of us wrest the stated order of Nature to serve our own purposes But the true philosophy of the matter is as Pope very justly expresses it in different parts of his Essay on Man  The Universal Cause  Acts not by  partial  but by  general  laws  And sees with equal eye as Lord of all  An heroe perish or a sparrow fall  Atoms or systems into ruin hurl'd  And now a bubble burst and now a world  ACT V  SCENE I  The effects of a guilty and disturbed mind are extremely well represented here in the person of Lady Macbeth by the words and actions with which she betrays her crime while she is walking in her sleep "A great perturbation in Nature" as her Doctor says  to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching  The Doctor upon discovering the cause of her malady very justly declares her to be no fit patient for his art and turns her over accordingly to Heaven and her confessors for a cure saying  Unnatural deeds  Do breed unnatural troubles infected minds  To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets  More needs she the  Divine  than the  Physician    God God forgive us all  And again in the Third Scene the same subject is continued  Macbeth  How does your patient doctor  Doctor  Not so sick my lord  As she is troubled with thickcoming fancies  That keep her from her rest  Macbeth  Cure her of that  Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased  Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow  Raze out the written troubles of the brain  And with some sweet oblivious antidote  Cleanse the full  The word is  stuff'd  in the text which I have taken the liberty of changing to  full  to avoid the tautology which occurs at the end of the line  bosom of that perilous stuff  Which weighs upon the heart  Doctor  Therein the patient  Must minister unto himself  Macbeth  Throw physic to the dogs I'll none of it  SCENE II  The situation and description of a wicked usurper involved in a domestic war to defend himself is finely painted here  Cathness and Angus speaking of Macbeth  Cathness  Some say he's mad others that lesser hate him  Do call it valiant fury but for certain  He cannot buckle his distempered cause  Within the belt of rule  Angus  Now does he feel  His secret murder sticking on his hands  Now minutely revolts upbraid his faithbreach  Those he commands move only in command  Nothing in love  now does he feel his title  H  ng  about him like a giant's robe  Upon a dwarfish thief  Cathness  This speech is spoken by Monteth in the original but I thought it needless to encumber the Drama with an additional character for so few lines  Who then shall blame  His pestered senses to recoil and start  When all that is within him does condemn  Itself for being there  SCENE III  But in this Scene the tyrant gives a just and shocking description of such a character himself  peaking in and of his own person  Macbeth  I have lived long enoughMy way  Way  for  stage    of life  Is f  l'n into the fear  S  ar  is  d  y  by  hich he alludes to the autumn of his life as is plain from the nex  exp  essi  n  yellow l  af    the yellow leaf  And that which should accompany old age  As honour love obedience troops of friends  I mu  t not look to have but in their stead  Curses  loud but deep mouthhomage  I have substituted  homage  for  honour  as the latter word is made use of just before  breath  Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not  SCENE V  The effect of habitual guilt in blunting all the fine feelings of the human heart is well noted here  Macbeth  on hearing a cry within  I have almost forgot the taste of fears  The time has been my senses would have cool'd  To hear a night shriek and my fell  Fell  is the  scalp  or skin of the head through which the hair grows  of hair  Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir  As life were in't I have supped full with horrors  Direness familiar to my slaught'rous thoughts  Cannot once start me  He then falls into a reflection on the nature of human life which presents us with but a melancholy prospect of our present state of existence  Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow  Creeps in this petty pace from day to day  To the last syllable of recorded time  And all our yesterdays have lighted fools  The way to dusty death Out out brief candle  Life's but a walking shadow a poor player  That struts and frets his hour upon the stage  And then is heard no more It is a tale  Told by an idiot full of sound and fury  Signifying nothing  POSTSCRIPT  As I cannot bear the thought of suffering the last gloomy passage cited in the foregoing remarks to dwell upon my Reader's mind which by tempting him to repine at the ways of Providence might give him cause to lament his having ever been sent into such a  world of woe  I shall endeavour to argue as far as I am able against such representations of life as our author frequently gives us of our condition in it and in which he is too generally seconded by many of the more professed writers on Morality  These philosophers are apt to speak too severely upon the sum of human life but only seem to condemn it from distinct parts and particular instances which vice folly passions casualty or intemperance too often furnish for observation But I shall here venture to treat this subject more impartially by considering it upon the whole and according to the general state or condition in which the great Author of Nature has most benevolently supplied it to us  We are created with five perfect senses and the world is stored with variety of objects to afford pleasures to them all and these we are naturally framed to retain the possession of even to the full term of life prescribed by the Psalmist of  threescore years and ten  till that period of time when we may ourselves become weary of a longer continuance here not from the  disgust  of our disappointments but merely from the  satiety  of our enjoyments And though our strength may then or even before become weakness it may not however be encumbered either with decrepitude or pain and even to the last we may be still capable of using as much exercise as age requires or if any accidental ail should render more necessary an horse may restore the full benefit at least though perhaps not the use of our limbs  Let us add to these the pleasures of hope imagination reflection reading science conversation love friendship  Relations dear and all the charities  Of father son and brother  Even our most moderate satisfactions and enjoyments though their impressions may not be so sensibly felt during their continuance yet if their  moment  be calculated by multiplying the degree into the duration we shall find the amount to exceed the quantity of more poignant but shorter sensations  Let us also take into our account the vicissitude and variety of seasons with the alternation of day and night  Sweet is the breath of morn her rising sweet  With charm of earliest birds pleasant the sun  When first on this delightful land he spreads  His orient beams on herb tree fruit and flower  Glitt'ring with dew fragrant the fertile earth  After soft show'rs and sweet the coming on  Of grateful evening mild then silent night  With this her solemn bird and this fair moon  And these the gems of Heaven her starry train  Thus are described the delights of Eden by a Poet so enamoured of the beauties of Nature that he has certainly exerted his utmost powers to enhance her charms and yet even Milton's imagination was not able to transcend the reality of those objects and enjoyments which our common fields and gardens afford us every day  This is the common life of man this the condition of the yeoman the husbandman the labourer the artist the mechanic the servantthe  many  of mankind And where sickness pain loss of any sense or limb happens to the lot of individuals this is not according to the  course  of Nature but rather a  violence  against it And these accidents afflict not the  many  but the  few  nor is Providence any more answerable for the  natural  than for the  moral  ills of life one is but incidental to the general constitution and necessity of things and the other to the appetites and freewill of man  But sloth luxury ambition vicious passions envy hatred and malice may render some diseased in body and others discontented in mind This is not however the  condition  of their nature but the  corruption  of it and these are still not the  many  but the  few  not the  body  of the people but the  excrescences  which arise out of it and must be nourished at its costnamely the great the opulent and the proud  The happiness of life  Depends on our discretion  Look into those they call  unfortunate    And closer view'd you'll find they are  unwise    Some flaw in their own conduct lies beneath  And 'tis the trick of fools to save their credit  Which brought another language into use  The REVENGE  If what I have here said upon this comparative view of human nature were not true Providence must have shewn a manifest partiality to the inferior creation which is certainly placed in an happier state than man according to someto many writers But Plato speaks upon this subject with a much better philosophy than any of these moral sophisters when he says that  God is good for he bestows all that is good upon all creatures  according to their several capacities  Each is as happy as it can be or  as its nature permits  and if any thinks the several creatures could have been happier it is because he does not understand their natures  Who sees not Providence all good and wise  Alike in what it gives and what denies  POPE  It may not be improper to quote a passage here out of a letter from Mr Pope to Doctor Swift upon the subject of his  Essay on Man    I am just now says he writing or rather planning a book to bring mankind to look upon this life with comfort and pleasure  and put morality in good humour with itself    This is the true philosophy of sense and virtue Gloomy minds are deficient in both  CORIOLANUS  Dramatis Personae  MEN  CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS  COMINIUS  MENENIUS AGRIPPA  BRUTUS  SICINIUS  SENATORS  CITIZENS  WOMEN  VOLUMNIA  VIRGILIA  CORIOLANUS  ACT I  SCENE I  Enter a Number of mutinous Citizens armed with various Weapons  First Citizen  BEFORE we proceed any further hear me speak  All  Speak speak  First Citizen  You are all resolved rather to die than to famish  All  Resolved resolved  First Citizen  First you know Caius Marcius is the chief enemy to the people  All  We know't we know't  First Citizen  Let us kill him and we'll have corn at our own price Is't a verdict  All  No more talking on't let it be done Away away  Second Citizen  One word good citizens  First Citizen  We are accounted poor citizens the Patricians good What authority surfeits on would relieve us If they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear  Not worth the charge of maintaining  The leanness that afflicts us the object of our misery is as an inventory to particularize their abundance our sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with our  pikes  ere we become  rakes  This miserable clinch is not worth the trouble of correcting or explaining  for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge  The nature and reasoning of all mutinous caballers are fully shewn in the above short scene The common people are apt to impute all national grievances or calamities to the fault of their rulers tho' ever so unavoidable from the nature of things failure of seasons or other incidental misfortunes whatsoever If freedom of speech and the liberty of the press were not restrained in Turkey I make no  doubt but a Mussulman populace would charge the plague to the account of their Sultans or their Viziers  In the same scene that abatement of esteem and praise which is the natural consequence of persons appearing to overrate their own merits more especially when this is betrayed by shewing pride or contempt to others is very justly remarked on  Second Citizen  Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius  All  Against him first He's a very dog to the commonalty  Second Citizen  Consider you what services he has done for his country  First Citizen  Very well and could be content to give him good report for't but that  he pays himself with being proud    All  Nay but speak not maliciously  First Citizen  I say unto you what he hath done famously he did it to that end Though softconscienced men can be content to say it was for his country he did it  to please his mother  and to be partly proud which he is even to the altitude of his virtue  The above expression of  to please his mother  is taken verbatim from Plutarch who in the Life of Coriolanus says of him  The end which others proposed in their acts of valour was glory but he pursued glory  because the acquisition of it delighted his mother    Though this seems to be a childish reason yet 'tis very well to be accounted for His father died when Caius Marcius was but an infant the care of his education then devolved upon the mother who gave him his first lessons of bravery and honour and took pains to inspire his youth with that martial spirit which she thought became a Roman and a Patrician It was natural then that his exploits should still bear a reference to the person under whose tutelage he had been trained to arms  SCENE II  Here Menenius Agrippa expostulates with the unruly populace in a manner conformable to my first remark on the preceding Scene  Menenius  Why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours  Will you undo yourselves  Citizen  We cannot Sir we are undone already  Menenius  I tell you friends most charitable care  Have the Patricians of you For your wants  Your sufferings in this dearth you may as well  Strike at the heavens with your staves as lift them  Against the Roman state whose course will on  The way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs  Of more strong links asunder than can ever  Appear in your impediment For the dearth  The gods not the Patricians make it and  Your knees to them not arms must help Alack  You are transported by calamity  Thither where more attends you and you slander  The helms o' th' state who care for you like fathers  When you curse them as enemies  But this argument not quieting the tumult he proceeds to give them the famous apologue of  The Belly and Members  borrowed from Aesop which though already so generally known that it need not be related yet as the Reader may chuse to see the story in Shakespeare's stile and manner of telling it I shall supply the fable here leaving out the several breaks and interruptions of the dialogue in which 'tis recited  Menenius  Either you must  Confess yourselves wond'rous malicious  Or be accused of folly I shall tell you  A pretty tale it may be you have heard it  But since it serves my purpose I will venture  To stale 't  Stale it  to render it more  stale  by repeating it Theobald The word in the text is  scale    a little more  There was a time when all the body's members  Rebelled against the belly thus accused it  That only like a gulph it did remain  I' th' midst o' th' body idle and unactive  Still cupboarding the viand never bearing  Like labour with the rest where  Fitly  for  exactly  Warburton  the other instruments  Did see and hear devise instruct walk feel  And mutually participate did minister  Unto the appetite and affection common  Of the whole bodyThe belly answered  And tauntingly replied  To th' discontented members th' mutinous parts  That envied his receiptsEven so most fitly  Where  for  whereas  Johnson    As you malign our senators for that  They are not such as youNote me good friend  Your most grave belly was deliberate  Not rash like his accusers and thus answered  True is it my incorporate  The word  incorporate  has a double propriety in this place as applying equally to the body natural and the body politic The Commentators have given notes upon more insignificant passages  friends quoth he  That I receive the general food at first  Which you do live upon and fit it is  Because I am the storehouse and the shop  Of the whole body But if you do remember  I send it through the rivers of your blood  Even to the court the heart to th' seat o' th' brain  And through the cranks  Cranks  put here for the circulation of the blood and other juices of the body  Crank  signifies a winding passage  and offices of man  The strongest nerves and small inferior veins  From me receive that natural competency  Whereby they live And though that all at once  You my good friends this says the belly mark me  Though all at once you cannot  See what I do deliver out to each  Yet I can make my audit up that all  From me do back receive the  flour  of all  And leave me but the  bran    He then gives them the exposition of the allegory in the following words  The senators of Rome are this good belly  And you the mutinous members for examine  Their counsels and their cares digest things rightly  Touching the weal o' th' common you shall find  No public benefit which you receive  But it proceeds or comes from them to you  And no way from yourselves  SCENE III  Here Coriolanus in a stile of austerity and haughtiness which he preserves through the whole of his spirited but harsh character rates the malecontent citizens in a speech which truly describes the nature of every populace in all free states  He that will give good words to thee will flatter  Beneath abhorring What would ye have ye curs  That likes  Like  instead of  like nor peace nor war  Whose dispositions belong both cowardly and insolent are neither suited to a state of peace or war  nor peace nor war The one affrights you  The other makes you proud He that trusts to you  Where he should find you lions finds you hares  Where foxes geese you are no surer no  Than is the coal of fire upon the ice  Or hailstone in the sun Your virtue  Virtue  for  nature  or  quality    is  To make him worthy whose offence subdues him  And curse that justice did it  This passage surely needed an explanation to all but the quick conceptions of the Commentators who have therefore neglected it The meaning I take to be this  You would chant  ut hymns of triumph to the conqueror who should enslave while you'd  in arms against the laws that would restrain you  Who deserves greatness  Deserves your hate and your affections are  A sick man's appetite who desires most that  Which would encrease his evilHe that depends  Upon your favours  swims with fins of lead    And hews down oaks with rushes  Hang yeTrust ye  With every minute you do change a mind  And call him noble that was now your hate  Him vile that was your garland What's the matter  That in the several places of the city  You cry against the noble senate who  Under the gods keep you in awe which else  Would feed on one another  And afterwards speaking of them to Menenius he adds  They'll sit by the fire and presume to know  What's done i' th' Capitol who's like to rise  Who thrives and who declines side factions and give out  Conjectural marriages  Marriages  for  leagues  or  alliances    making parties strong  And feeble such as stand not in their liking  Below their cobbled shoes  SCENE VI  This place affords us a description of the characteristic  Roman Matron  of those times set in contrast with the  Woman of Nature    Volumnia  the Mother and  Virgilia  the Wife of  Coriolanus  after he had marched against the  Volscians  Volumnia  I pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a more comfortable sort If my son were my husband I would freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would shew most love When yet he was but tender bodied and the only son of my hope when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze that way when for a day of a king's entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding I considering how honour would become such a person that it was no better than picturelike to hang  the wall if renown made it not stir was pleased to see him seek  anger where he was like to find fame To a cruel war I sent him from whence he returned his brows bound with oak  The  wreath  given as a mark of distinction to those who had saved the l  of a citizen in battle  I tell thee daughter I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man  Virgilia  But had he died in the business madam how then  Volumnia  Then his good report should have been my son I therein would have found issue Hear me profess sincerely Had I a dozen sons each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my good Marcius I had rather eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action  There appears to be a vast difference here between the sentiments of these two matrons but this may well be accounted for from the difference of their situations and circumstances of life Volumnia having been left a widow in the infancy of her son and taking upon herself the charge of his education had it may be supposed soon silenced the tenderness of a mother in her breast and assumed the spirit of a father to fulfil her trust and by constantly endeavouring to inspire her pupil with the chief virtues of a Roman magnanimity and love of his country she may be said in a manner to have educated herself at the same time to bravery fortitude and contempt of death  SCENE IX  The true character of a soldier is well described in this Scene When Coriolanus in the heat of battle and covered with blood demands a fresh supply of troops from Cominius the General answers  Take your choice of those  That best can aid your action  Coriolanus  Those are they  That are most willing If any such be here  As it were sin to doubt that love this painting  Wherein you see me smeared if any fear  pointing to his bloody front  Less for his person than an ill report  If any think brave death outweighs bad life  And that his country's dearer than himself  Let him alone or many if so minded  Wave thus t' express his disposition  Waving his hand  And follow Marcius  ACT II  SCENE II  That warmth of affection with which Menenius greets good news from his friend must charm the sensible Reader On hearing that Coriolanus had defeated the Volscians and written a letter to him on that occasion he cries out in transport  Take my cap  Meaning I'll throw up my  cap  to the skies for joy Doctor Warburton changes the word to  cup  as designing a  libation  of thanksI think unnecessarily  Jupiter and I thank thee Hoo Marcius coming home I will make my house reel tonight A letter for me It gives me an estate of seven years health in which time I will make a lip at the physician  Scorn the aid of physic  the most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiric and to this preservative of no better report  Of no more value or estimation  than a horsedrench  And again in the next Scene upon meeting him he expresses the fulness of his heart which exceeds even to pain in very strong and apt terms  A hundred thousand welcomes  I could weep  And I could laugh I'm light and heavy  Welcome  These speeches have a double beauty in them if 'tis considered by whom they are delivered It would not have near the effect upon the Reader if spoken by a more stayed and sober person for virtues are apt to strike us more forcibly in slight characters than in solid ones and Menenius has already given us a description of himself in the preceding Scene which sufficiently justifies me in this distinction  I am known to be a humorous Patrician and one that loves a cup of  wine without a drop of allaying Tiber in't said to be somethi  g imperfect in savouring the first complaint  Apt too quickly to follow the suggestions of my appetite  hasty and tind  like upon too trivial motion one that converses more with t  buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning Wha  I think I utter and spend my malice in my breath  SCENE III  As I have quoted several descriptions of character before in the course of this work for the reason already given in its proper place as being within the prescription of moral and besides that those were merely imaginary though truly copied from real life I think that this one of Coriolanus being sufficiently vouched from authentic story  Plutarch Livy c  ought therefore to be more particularly remarked upon in these notes  In the first Scene of the former Act in a passage above quoted second remark one of the discontented citizens charges him with paying himself for his services  with being proud  and his reproach was just But yet here he seems to appear in a light the very reverse of such a character for when the herald in the voice of Rome is proclaiming his merits he stops him short by crying out  No more of this it does offend my heart  Pray now no more  He manifests the same modesty also in the Sixth Scene following When he appears to be uneasy in his seat upon the applause given him for his prowess one of the senators says to him  Sit Coriolanus never shame to hear  What you have nobly done  To which he replies  Your honour's pardon  I'd rather have my wounds to heal again  Than hear say how I got them  Brutus  Sir I hope  My words disbenched you not  This alludes to a speech of his in this S  ene not quoted here where he charges Coriolanus with his contempt of the people    Coriolanus  No Sir yet oft  When blows have made me stay I fled from words  You soothe not therefore hurt not  but your people  I love them as they weigh  Menenius  Pray now sit down  Coriolanus  I had rather have one scratch my head i' th' sun  When the alarum were struck than idly sit  To hear my  nothings  monstered  Monstered  so much wondered at    Menenius  You see  To the people  He had rather venture all his limbs for honour  Than one of 's ears to hear it  Afterwards Cominius speaking of him says  Our spoils he kicked at  And looked upon things precious as they were  The common muck o' th' world he covets less  Than misery  Misery  for  avarice    itself would give rewards  His deeds with doing them and is content  To spend his time to  spend  it  To do great actions for the sake of doing them The comment and the alteration of the text from  end it  to  spend it  is Doctor Johnson's    Again when he is pressed to harangue the people in order to get himself elected Consul he answers in the same stile and spirit of character  I beseech you  Let me o'erleap that custom for I cannot  Put on the gown stand naked  Exposing his body to shew his wounds  and intreat them  For my wounds' sake to give their suffrages  Please you that I may pass this doing  S  cinius  Sir the people must have their voices  Nor will they bate one jot of ceremony  Menenius  Put them not to'tPray  it you to the custom  And take t' ye as your predecessors have  Your honour with your form  Coriolanus  It is a part  That I shall blush in acting and might well  Be taken from the people  To brag unto them thus I did and thus  Shew them th' unaching scars which I would hide  As if I had received them for the hire  Of their breath only  But these seeming contradictions form in effect but one character still The overvaluing his merits and the undervaluing the applause of them are both equally founded in pride fierceness and impatience Plutarch draws a comparison of Coriolanus with Alcibiades but I think he more resembles Achilles as described by Horace  Vigilant irascible inflexible harsh and above all laws acknowledging no rights but those of conquest  Impiger iracundus inexorabilis acer  J  ra neget fibi nata nihil non arroge  armis    Let us now return to the third Scene again from whence the pursuit of our subject had tempted us to wander  When Coriolanus comes home victorious from the Volscian war his family and friends gather about him complimenting and congratulating him on his bravery and success all but Virgilia his wife whose heart being fuller of joy and fondness than them all put together was therefore rendered incapable of uttering a syllable on that occasion Upon which he salutes her thus  My gracious silence hail  Doctor Warburton gives the following note upon this passage  The epithet joined to  silence  shews  it not to proceed from sullenness or reserve but to be the effect of a virtuous mind possessing itself in peace The expression is extremely sublime and the sense of it conveys the finest praise that can be given to a woman  I perfectly agree with the Doctor in his opinion both of the beauty of the expression and the merit of the character implied in it I have taken the liberty of leaving out the adjunct  good  joined to the last word in his note as being superfluous in that place for no  bad  one can possibly deserve praise  SCENE VII  Coriolanus preserves still the same kind of indomitable sturdiness and severity in the following speech where he also takes occasion very justly to censure the superstitious reverence the world is too apt to bear towards customs which are not founded in reason  When he has with infinite difficulty been prevailed upon by his friends to solicit votes for the Consulate and having obtained them being left alone he speaks thus to himself  Most sweet voices  Better it is to die better to starve  Than crave the hire which first we do deserve  Why in this woolvish  The candidates gown was made of rough undyed wool  gown should I stand here  To beg of Hob and Dick that do appear  Their needless voucher Custom calls me to't  What custom wills in all things should we do't  The dust on antique time would lie unswept  And mountainous error be too highly heapt  For truth to o'erpeerRather than fool it so  Let the high office and the honour go  To one that would do thus  ACT IV  SCENE I  The difference between the philosophy we preach and that we practise is properly distinguished in this Scene  When Coriolanus is going into exile and taking leave of his family and friends he endeavours to restrain the immoderate grief of his mother on that occasion by repeating those stoical precepts to her which she had often inculcated to him during the term of his pupilage  Coriolanus  Come leave your tearsA brief farewel The beast  With many heads butts me awayNay mother  Where is your antient courage You were used  To say extremity was the trier of spirits  That common chances common men could bear  That when the sea was calm all boats alike  Shewed mastership in floating Fortune's blows  When most struck home being gentle wounded craves  A noble cunning  This passage is confusedly expressedThe meaning is that when fortune has given us severe blows to preserve a mild or gentle temper under our wounds requires a well practised  philosophy  which he calls  cunning  as being a difficult art  science  You were used to load me  With precepts that would make invincible  The heart that conned them  Volumnia  Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome  And occupations perish  Coriolanus  What what what  I shall be loved when I am lackedNay mother  Resume that spirit when you we  e wont to say  If you had been the wife of Hercules  Six of his labours you'd have done and saved  Your husband so much sweat Cominius  Droop not adieuFarewel my wife my mother  I'll do well yetThou old and true Menenius  Thy tears are salter than a younger man's  And venomous to thine eyes My sometime general  I've seen thee stern and thou hast oft beheld  Hearthard'ning spectacles Tell these sad women  'Tis fond  s weak idle or foolish  to wail inevitable strokes  As 'tis to laugh at them  SCENE III  In the following speech there is too true a picture given of the instability of human friendships and connections  Coriolanus  Oh world thy slippery turns friends now fast sworn  Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart  Whose hours whose bed whose meal and exercise  Are still together who twine as 'twere in love  Unseparable shall within this hour  On a dissention of a doit break out  To bitterest enmity So fellest foes  Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep  To take the one the other by some chance  Some trick  Some slight occasion or trivial motive  not worth an egg shall grow dear friends  And interjoin their issues  ACT V  SCENE I  Menenius when he is going to parley with Coriolanus on the part of Rome makes a speech which shews a perfect knowledge of human nature for certainly a proper attention to times seasons and circumstances goes a considerable way towards the success of our requests  I'll undertake it  I think he'll hear meYet to bite his lip  And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me  He was not taken well he had not dined  The veins unfilled our blood is cold and then  We pout upon the morning are unapt  To give or to forgive but when we've stuff'd  These pipes and these conveyances of blood  With wine and feeding we have suppler souls  Than in our priestlike fasts Therefore I'll watch him  Till he be  dieted  to my request  And then I'll set upon him  SCENE III  Coriolanus upon seeing his wife mother and son come habited in mourning to solicit in favour of Rome says  My wife comes foremost then the honoured mould  Wherein this trunk was framed and in her hand  The grandchild to her bloodBut out Affection  All bond and privilege of nature break  Let it be virtuous to be obstinate  Virgilia bends  What is that curt'sie worth Or those dove's eyes  Which might make gods forsworn I melt and am not  Of stronger earth than others My mother bows  As if Olympus to a molehill should  In supplication nod and my young boy  Hath an aspect of intercession which  Great Nature cries  Deny not  Let the Volscians  Plough Rome and harrow Italy I'll never  Be such a gosling to obey instinct  but stand  As if a man were author of himself  And knew no other kin  Coriolanus has here carried his sternness and the strained principles of stoical pride whose throne is only  in the mind  as far as they could go and now great Nature whose more sovereign seat of empire is  in the heart  takes her turn to triumph for upon the joint prayers tears and intreaties of his family he becomes  a man  at last▪ crying out  Not of a woman's tenderness to be  Requires nor child nor woman's face to see  I've sat too long  Endeavours to go but is withheld  And afterwards being quite overcome by his affections he thus exclaims  O mother mother  Holding her hands and keeping silent for some time  What have you done Behold the heavens do ope  The gods look down and this unnatural scene  Do laugh at  Look down with contempt on the unequal strife between pride and nature  Oh my mother mother oh  You've won a happy victory to Rome  But for your sonBelieve it oh believe it  Most dangerously you have with him prevailed  If not most mortal to himLet it come  The expressions in the first part of this latter speech with the prophetical conclusion of it are taken almost literally from Plutarch in his Life of Coriolanus  JULIUS CAESAR  Dramatis Personae  MEN  JULIUS CAESAR  MARK ANTONY  BRUTUS  CASSIUS  OCTAVIUS  METELLUS CIMBER  MESSALA  LUCILIUS  ARTEMIDORUS  WOMEN  NONE  JULIUS CAESAR  IN this Scene there is a notion delivered which may be productive of good or bad effects according to the characters of the persons who embrace it In rational and virtuous minds it may inspire an active pursuit of fortune in whatever profession or scene of life they are engaged in but in weak or wicked natures may betray to hazardous schemes or tempt to vicious courses The same principle has made generals and admirals of common soldiers and sailors chancellors and bishops of attorneys' clerks and sizers  Sizer  the lowest rank of students in an University  on the one part projectors conspirators usurpers and assassins on the other  Cassius  Men at some times are masters of their fates  The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars  But in ourselves that we are underlings  Brutus and Caesar What should be in that Caesar  Why should that name be sounded more than yours  Write them together yours is as fair a name  Sound them it doth become the mouth as well  Weigh them it is as heavy conjure with them  Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar  Now in the names of all the gods at once  Upon what meat does this our Caesar feed  That he is grown so great  SCENE IV  There is a truly philosophic reflection made here on the several characters of men taken both from their persons and manners This is one of the many instances of our Author's knowledge and observation upon human nature  Caesar  and  Antony  Let me have men about me that are fat  Sleekheaded men and such as sleep anights  You Cassius has a lean and hungry look  He thinks too muchSuch men are dangerous  Antony  Fear him not Caesar he's not dangerous  He is a noble Roman and well given  Caesar  'Would he were fatter  But I fear him not  Yet if my name  I was temped to change this word to  mind  as being more intelligible but I recollected that Shakespeare meant to make Caesar affect to speak of his  name  as his  person  He says afterwards in the same speech  For always I am Caesar  and throughout in the same s  ile  were liable to fear  I do not know the man I should avoid  So soon as that spare Cassius He reads much  He is a great observer and he looks  Quite through the deeds of men He loves no plays  As thou dost Antony he hears no music  Seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort  As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit  That could be moved to smile at any thing  Such men as he be never at heart's ease  Whilst they behold a greater than themselves  And therefore are they very dangerous  SCENE V  Brutus  and  Cassius  Brutus  speaking of  Casca  What a blunt fellow is this grown to be  He was quick mettle when he went to school  Cassius  So is he now in execution  Of any bold or noble enterprize  However he puts on this tardy form  This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit  Which gives men stomach to digest his words  With better appetite  The above is a sort of character we often meet with in life and which has generally the effect here attributed to it  In the same Scene there is a just and prudent maxim set forth with regard to the persons and characters that men should associate themselves with who would preserve either their understanding their honour or integrity  Cassius  Well Brutus thou art noble yet I see  Thy honourable metal may be wrought  From what it is disposed therefore  'tis meet  That noble minds keep ever with their likes  For who so firm that cannot be seduced  Some moral writer says  That if men of sense taste or virtue have not an opportunity of conversing with their equals they had much better live alone  They will certainly be able to preserve these rare qualities much better in solitude than in unequal societyThere is a contagion in minds and manners as well as in bodies when corrupt  ACT II  SCENE I  Brutus  solus    It must be by his death and for my part  I have no personal cause to spurn at him  But for the generalHe would be crowned  How that might change his nature there's the question  It is the bright day that brings forth the adder  And that craves wary walkingCrown himthat  And then I grant we put a sting in him  That at his will he may do danger with  Th' abuse of greatness is when it disjoins  Remorse from power and to speak truth of Caesar  I have not known when his affections swayed  More than his reason But 'tis a common proof  That lowliness is young Ambition's ladder  Whereto the climber upwards turns his face  But when he once attains the utmost round  He then unto the ladder turns his back  Looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees  By which he did ascend So Caesar may  Then lest he may preventAnd since the quarrel  Will bear no colour for the thing he is  We have no pretence for destroying him from his present appearance of character    Fashion it thus that what he is augmented  Would run to these and these extremities  And therefore think him as a serpent's egg  Which hatched would as his kind grow mischievous  And kill him in the shell  \  In this soliloquy or selfdebate upon the intended assassination of Caesar the too common frailty of  man in the circumstances of successful ambition is strongly described under two very just and poetical images but the inference drawn from it in the conclusion is certainly carried too far It might perhaps have become an Heathen to prevent an ill without respecting the means but a Christian thank God is forbidden  to do evil even though good should come of it    In the continuance of this soliloquy Brutus gives a strong description of the state of mind which precedes the execution of any great or hazardous purpose  Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar  I have not slept  Between the acting of a dreadful thing  And the first motion all the interim is  Like a phantasma or a hideous dream  The genius and the mortal instruments  He supposes a struggle between the good genius and the passions  Are then in council and the state of man  Like to a little kingdom suffers then  The nature of an insurrection  Mr Addison in his Cato has a reflection of the same kind but it would be illiberal to quote it here after the strength of imagery and expression in this of Shakespeare'sBesides indeed as Doctor Warburton candidly allows  There was a great difference between the two occasions  Even as much we may add as there is between the two speeches  SCENE II  The needlessness of oaths to bind compacts between honest men to which indeed might be added the insufficiency of them to bind knaves is well urged in this place  When the cautious Cassius proposes to the conspirators that they shall all enter into a solemn covenant together to sanctify their mutual engagements  the nobler Brutus opposes it in the following words  No not an oath If not the face of men  The face of men  either the dejected looks of the people or their countenance and approbation of the measure    The sufferance of our souls the times abuse  If these be motives weak break off betimes  And ev'ry man hence to his idle bed  So let highsighted tyranny range on  'Till each man drop by lotteryBut if these  As I am sure they do bear fire enough  To kindle cowards and to steel with valour  The melting spirits of women then countrymen  What need we any spur but our own cause  To prick us to redress What other bond  Than secret Romans that have spoke the word  And will not palter  To  palter  to  shift  or  shuffle    And what other oath  Than honesty to honesty engaged  That this shall be or we will fall for it  Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous  Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls  That welcome wrongs Unto bad causes swear  Such creatures as men doubt but do not stain  The even virtue of our enterprize  Nor th' insuppressive mettle of our spirits  To think that or our cause or our performance  Did need an oath when every drop of blood  That ev'ry Roman bears and nobly bears  Is guilty of a several bastardy  If he doth break the smallest particle  Of any promise that hath past from him  Cicero is then proposed to be added to their league and for the following good and prudent reason  Metellus Cimber  O let us have him for his silver hairs  Will purchase us a good opinion  And buy men's voices to commend our deeds  It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands  Our youth and wildness shall no whit appear  But all be buried in his gravity  But he is objected to on account of a sort of character which is not uncommon in life and is justly descriptive also of the person to whom it is applied who though certainly a very great man  was notwithstanding a vain and selfopinionated one likewise  Brutus  O name him not let us not break with him  Impart the secret to him    For he will never follow any thing  That other men begin  Afterwards when Cassius urges the expediency of involving Antony in the same doom with Caesar Brutus very nobly refuses to concur upon the following reasons  Our course will seem too bloody Caius Cassius  To cut the head off and then hack the limbs  Like wrath in death and envy  Envy  for  malice    afterwards  For Antony is but a limb of Caesar  And in the spirit of man there is no blood  Oh that we then could come by Caesar's spirit  And not dismember Caesar But alas  Caesar must bleed for itAnd gentle friends  Let's kill him boldly but not wrathfully  Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods  Not hew him as a carcase fit for hounds  And let our hearts as subtle masters do  Stir up their servants to an act of rage  And after seem to chide them  This passage is very obscure and the Commentators according to their usual supineness have left it unnoticed The meaning may be thisLet us impute the act to our passions instigated by our fears and then appear to lament the violence of their proceedings  This shall make  Our purpose necessary and not envious  Which so appearing to the common eyes  We shall be deemed  purgers  not  murderers    It were much to be wished for the sake both of decency and humanity that such a sentiment as this was the spirit of laws relative to all capital punishmentsBreaking on the wheel empaling and other foreign penalties of death are horrible even to thought and what must they be to the view Even our own code though reckoned milder than our neighbours is hardly less barbarous in the instances of quartering burning and pressing to death if executed according to the full rigour of the sentence But the hangman it seems has more  humanity than the legislature as he is said always to render the criminal senseless before he proceeds to the severity of the statute He first kills the  spirit  the  demon  of the law and then only executes the  dead  letter of it  There is a sentiment upon this subject in a late writing which I think may very properly be quoted here  I would have all laws mild but executed with the utmost strictness so that justice and humanity may go hand in hand together I am not for severe executions for when the penalty exceeds the offence it is not  the criminal  but  human nature  that suffers Death alone is sufficient to remove the offender  Series of Letters between Henry and Frances    But methinks this argument might be urged still further in favour of clemencySuppose we should reason thus  All laws are a mutual compact of society entered into with itself The  Many  can confide to the  Few  those rights only which they respectively possess in themselves To confer a power of death then should seem to imply  a right of suicide    I declare myself unable to detect any manner of sophistry in such a syllogism  SCENE IV  Caesar  Cowards die many times before their deaths  The valiant never taste of death but once  Of all the wonders that I yet have heard  It seems to me most strange that men should fear  Seeing that death a necessary end  Will come when it wil  come  The philosophy of death is well enough argued here according to the old Stoical doctrine of fate or predestination This should seem to be a good notion for a mere soldier but yet we do not find in the late  carnage  The war between the Czarina and the Porte  that it rendered the Turks braver who believe in it than it did the Russians who do not  ACT III  SCENE I  Caesar speaks a sentence here which shews him to have been worthy of a better fate  When Artemidorus upon seeing the number of papers presented to him on his march to the capital cries out  O Caesar read mine first for mine's a suit  That touches Caesar nearerRead it great Caesar  he replies in the true spirit of a prince  What touches us ourself shall be last served  And afterwards when Metellus Cimber pleads for the repeal of his brother's banishment he answers him with the proper steadiness of a person intrusted with the executive province of a legislature  I must prevent thee Cimber  These couchings and these lowly curtesies  Might stir  Stir  instead of  fire    Warburton  the blood of ordinary men  And turn preordinance and first decree  Into the law  Law  instead of  lane Of children  whose minds are easily wrought on  Johnson  of children Be not fond  Be not so weakly persuaded  To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood  That will be thawed from the true quality  With that which melteth fools I mean sweet words  Low crooked curtesies and base spanielfawning  Thy brother by decree is banished  If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him  I spurn thee like a cur out of my way  Know Caesar doth not wrong nor without cause  Will he be satisfied  I cannot help thinking that the Poet has not given either Caesar fair play for his life or Brutus for his character in bringing on the assassination so immediately after the one has uttered and the other heard the two foregoing speeches  The last sentence above was not necessary to be quoted for the purpose of the speech merely as far as it had been specified in the note which precedes  it but I confess that I was anxious to produce it in order to take an opportunity of vindicating our Author from an absurdity of expression which has been so disingenuously imputed to him by his rival Ben Johnson who charges him with having wrote that passage thus  "Caesar never did  wrong  but with  just cause  "  Now  O rare Ben Johnson  The epithet by which he is characterised on his tomb  what manner of foundation could'st thou have for such a sarcasm except in the envious malice of thine own nature for the very copy from which the present text is taken was published in thine own lifetime  Or suppose that the line had really stood as Johnson has pretended to have quoted it might not any candid critic who was at all versed in the latitude of expression generally made use of by Shakespeare have sufficiently obviated the contradiction in the terms by only construing the word  wrong  into the sense of  injury  for a penalty is certainly an  injury  In the sense of  hurt  or  detriment    though not a  wrong    I hope my Reader will not think this note to be any manner of interruption to the general tenor of these remarks as he must acknowledge that there is a proper moral in defending the Author of this great code of Ethics from any aspersion thrown out against his sense meaning or character  In the last passage of this Scene the two principal patriots Brutus and Cassius shew a noble spirit in not endeavouring to support themselves after the deed by  faction  in the common sense of the word trusting solely to the justice and policy they had presumed in the act itself for their security and defence  Cassius speaking to Publius who was present at the transaction but not any way concerned in the conspiracy says  Leave us Publius lest that the people  Rushing on us should do your age some mischief  Brutus  Do so and let no man abide this deed  But we the doers  SCENE II  Besides that inward complacency which a virtuous person is sensible of in the consciousness of his merits there is something further in human nature which prompts his reflection forward to the fame which may attend his actions in future times Our Author has placed this incitement in the strongest light by delivering the sentiment from the confession of two such stoical interlocutors as the following  Cassius  How many ages hence  Shall this our lofty scene be acted o'er  In states unborn and accents yet unknown  Brutus  How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport  That now on Pompey's basis lies along  No worthier than the dust  Cassius  So oft as that shall be  So often shall the knot of us be called  The men that gave their Country liberty  SCENE III  Antony  on seeing the body of Caesar  O mighty Caesar do'st thou lie so low  Are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils  Shrunk to this little measure  The above exclamation is a dirge which may be justly pronounced over the graves of all heroes or other great men whose fame is not founded in virtue  ACT IV  SCENE I  As the following description falls under the head of Character for which I have long since opened  an account in these remarks as relative to manners at least but often to morals I shall present it to the Reader who must have made but little observation on life if it does not bring many resemblances of the same picture into his mind  Antony and Octavius speaking of Lepidus whom they had just dispatched to bring them Caesar's will  Antony  This is a slight unmeritable man  Meet to be sent on errands  Octavius  But he's a tried and valiant soldier  Antony  So is my horse Octavius and for that  I do appoint him store of provender  It is a creature that I teach to fight  To wind to stop to run directly on  His corporal motion governed by my spirit  And in some taste is Lepidus but so  He must be taught and trained and bid go forth  A barrenspirited fellow one that feeds  On abject orts  Orts refuse scraps  or  lumber  of philosophy or literature  and imitations  Which out of use and staled  Become vulgar and commonplace  by other men  Begin his fashion Do not talk of him  But as a property  SCENE II  The following passage may be added to the many instances of our Author's knowledge of human nature collected from his close observations on mankind  Brutus having sent Lucilius to Cassius upon some friendly or confederate business between them asks him on his return  A word Lucilius  How he received you let me be resolved  Lucilius  With courtesy and with respect enough  But not with such familiar instances  Nor with such free and friendly conference  As he hath used of old  Brutus  Thou hast described  A hot friend cooling Ever note Lucilius  When love begins to sicken and decay  It useth an enforced ceremony  There are no tricks in plain and simple faith  But hollow men like horses hot at hand  Make gallant shew and promise of their mettle  But when they should endure the bloody spur  They fall their crest and like deceitful jades  Sink in the trial  SCENE V  Brutus on hearing of his wife's death  Why farewel Portia We must die Messala  With meditating that she must die once  I have the patience to endure it now  Cassius  I have as much of this in art as you  But yet my nature could not bear it so  Here Brutus speaks like  a Stoic  and Cassius like  a man  Such instances of apathy are not captivating  A little after he says  The deep of night is crept upon our talk  And Nature must obey necessity  Which we will niggard with a little rest  Now pray why should Nature be more obedient to necessity in  sleeping  than in  weeping  She has her course in both let proud man boast what he will  A modern writer asks very justly  Why we should be more ashamed of weeping than of laughing The first emotion  says he  arises from nobler motives and more generous principles  Man has been defined to be a  risible animal  Methinks it would be more for the honour of his nature to have been stiled a  lachrymate one  understanding the expression in a moral sense by distinguishing between the effect of  pain  and  grief    Further on in the same Scene the critical contingencies of human life are finely illustrated by an apt and beautiful simile  Brutus  There is a tide in the affairs of men  Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune  Omitted all the voyage of their life  Is bound in shallows and in miseries  On such a full sea are we now afloat  And we must take the current when it serves  Or lose our ventures  ACT V  SCENE III  Brutus  O that a man might know  The end of this day's business ere it come  But it sufficeth that the day will end  And then the end is known  Here the disciple of Zeno  Father of the Stoic philosophy  being  off his guard  betrays a portion of human frailty in his curiosity and anxiety about the event of the battle but upon  recollecting  his philosophy he recovers himself to his  posture of defence  again Such pretenders are but  performers  Actors of parts  when closely examined  SCENE V  When Cassius has killed himself through despair from his having mistaken the appearances of an action which had turned out in his favour our author makes a just reflection upon the fatal effects of error and precipitancy  Messala  Mistrust of good success hath done this deed  Oh hateful Error Melancholy's child  Why dost thou shew to the apt  Apt  for  quick credulous easily alarmed    thoughts of men  The things that are not O Error soon conceived  Thou never com'st unto a happy birth  But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee  SCENE IX  I shall here conclude my remarks upon this Play with that fine character which Antony draws of Brutus in the generous elogy he makes upon his death  This was the noblest Roman of them all  All the conspirators save only he  Did that they did in envy of great Caesar  He only in a general honest thought  And common good to all made one of them  His life was gentle and the elements  So mixed in him that Nature might stand up  And say to all the world  This was a man    POSTSCRIPT  The assassination of Caesar is a fact famous in history but notwithstanding the heroic opinion which the world has been taught to conceive of it I confess that I have ever reputed its  fame  as a matter of  notoriety  rather than of  applause    I shall only consider this action in the person of Brutus alone because it has been thought that he was the only one among the conspirators who had engaged in it upon principle solely as Antony has said above  Plutarch has debated this subject in his comparison of Brutus with Dion and in my opinion seems to condemn it upon the whole At least if we take in the character he there draws of Caesar with the state and circumstances of the Commonwealth at that political crisis it plainly appears that he meant to declare against it  His words are  With respect to Caesar though whilst his imperial power was in its infancy he treated his opponents with severity yet as soon as that power was confirmed the tyranny was rather a  nominal  than a  real  thing for no tyrannical action could be laid to his charge Nay such was the condition of Rome then that it evidently required a  master  and Caesar was no more than  a tender and skilful physician appointed by Providence to heal the distempers of the state  Of course the people lamented his death and were implacably enraged against his  assassins    Cowley in his fine Ode to Brutus brings heavy charges also against him on account of this action though he seems only to do so in order to vindicate him from them But then he does not pretend to defend him from the facts themselves justifying him only upon the higher principle which had rendered him  guilty  of them  However I think that he is severer upon his heroe even than Plutarch by mentioning that weak and unphilosophic exclamation of his where he says  he had mistaken virtue for a good but found it only a name    What can we say but thine own tragic word  That  virtue  which had worshipped been by thee  As the most solid  good  and greatest  deity    By this fatal proof became  An  idol  only and a  name    This circumstance his Biographer had favourably suffered to pass unnoticed and of which Balzac says  that Brutus seems to lament his disappointment here  as if he was upbraiding a jilting mistress    If he had acted solely from  virtue  he would not have complained that he had missed the  reward    But though the principle might have been ever so right in itself the action was certainly wrong in him There are duties involved in duties sometimes which may counteract each other and thereby render what might be the  virtue  of one person the  vice  of another Many situations and cases of this kind may be proposed but I shall not launch beyond my subject  Brutus had many and great obligations to Caesar He owed him his lifenay 'tis said even his  first life  Caesar had an amour with Servilia the mother of Brutus before his birth  and had the lives of several of his friends saved also at his intercession He had ever lived with him in the greatest intimacy and on the footing of his  first friend  Nay Caesar had created himself enemies by his partiality towards him in the preferring him to posts of profit and honour which others from their services were better intitled to One of these malecontents was Cassius who from that very resentment became the first mover and principal actor in the conspiracy And were all these obligations to be cancelled by one dash of the  Stoic  's  pen  Stoical virtues  are not always  moral ones  Those metaphysical  braveries  for I was wrong in calling them  virtues  which exceed the feelings of humanity have never as I said before  See first observation on Scene I Act II and another on first part of Scene V Act IV  been able to inspire my mind with either admiration or esteem  The sympathy of nature is wanting and true philosophy has good reason to suspect every principle or motive of action to be sophisticate that bears

occurs one of those reflections which Shakespeare abounds in upon the instability of popular  favour and the simile by which he expresses himself is admirably suited to the occasion  Octavius  This common body  Like to a vagabond  Vagabond  for  floating    flag upon the stream  Goes to and back lacqueying  Comparing the flag fluctuating with the ebbing and flowing of the tide to a page or  lacquey  following the motions of his master Theobald  the varying tide  To rot itself with motion  ACT II  SCENE I  Pompey Menecrates  Pompey  If the great gods be just they shall assist  The deeds of justest men  Menecrates  Know worthy Pompey  That when they do delay they not deny  Pompey  While we are suitors to their throne decays  The thing we sue for  His meaning is that  a gift may lose its value before it is obtained  Health and fortune for instance may come too late for enjoyment    Menecrates  We ignorant of ourselves  Beg often our own harms which the wise Powers  Deny us for our good so find we profit  By losing of our prayers  The above passage needs no comment except to observe upon the impatience of one of the speakers and the resignation of the other It has often surprized me to see the intemperance of mind which the generality of men are apt to betray on the ordinary course of Providence whenever it happens to run counter to their  interests  or  inclinations  rather as the sentiment of Menecrates delivered above renders the first expression doubtful One would fancy that such people had never laughed at the story of  Xerxes whipping the sea    SCENE V  The last passage in this Scene is descriptive of that natural curiosity with which jealous persons are usually affected of enquiring anxiously into every article of mind or feature relative to their rivals  Cleopatra upon being informed of Antony's marriage with Octavia having first struck the  messenger of ill news  and drove him off the scene speaks thus to her women  Lead me from hence  I faintOh Iras Charmian'Tis no matter  Go to the fellow good Alexas bid him  Report the feature of Octavia her years  Her inclination  Her character or natural disposition  Let him not leave out  The colour of her hair Bring me word quickly  Ex Alex  Let him for ever go  Meaning Antony  Let him not Charmian  Though he be painted one way like a  Gorgon    The other way's a  Mars  Bid you Alexas  Bring word how tall she isPity me Charmian  But speak not to me  This is natural In great misfortunes we refuse comfort  Lead me to my chamber  Queen Elizabeth according to Sir James Melville's report made the same kind of minute inquiries from him about her rival the queen of Scots  SCENE VII  On board  Pompey  's vessel  Pompey Octavius Antony Lopidus  and  Menas  Menas  aside to  Pompey  Wilt thou be lord of the whole world  Pompey  How shall that be  Menas  Thou art if thou dar'st be the earthly Jove  Whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips  Is thine if thou wilt ha't  Pompey  Shew me which way  Menas  These three worldsharers these competitors  Antony Octavius and Lepidus    Are in thy vesselLet me cut the cable  And when we are put off fall to their throats  All then is thine  Pompey  Ah this thou should'st have done  And not have spoken on'tIn me 'tis villainy  In thee 't had been good serviceThou must know  'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour  Mine honour itRepent that e'er they tongue  Hath so betrayed thine actBeing done unknown  I should have found it afterwards well done  But must condemn it now  The dangerous salvo which men sometimes apply to their consciences in profiting of  another  's crime at free cost as they imagine is fully exposed in this Scene But in morals there is no difference between the  receiver  and the  thief  and as  the wages of sin  are pronounced to be  death  in the Scripture sense of the word the delinquent who accepts the emoluments of vice must expect to be included under the same sentence  ACT III  SCENE I  Moral writers have been distinguished into two classes of philosophy whereof one set of them are said to elevate human nature to the rank of angels while the other depreciates it to the vileness of those  who had once been so  But our author represents it more impartially neither inclining to one side or the other for there is not perhaps a virtue or a vice in mankind which he has not pointed out to us in the several characters he has occasionally introduced into his general drama In this Scene he has afforded us an instance in the latter predicament by a description of that invidiousness with which men are apt to regard superior merit in others more especially in those talents which they are ambitious of shining in themselves  When Silius advises Ventidius to compleat his conquest over the Parthians in order to recommend himself the more eminently to the favour of Antony his general the old soldier makes a reply which shews him not only to have been versed in camps but in courts also  Oh Silius Silius  I've done enough A lower place note well  May make too great an act For learn this Silius  Better to leave undone than by our deed  Acquire too high a fame when he we serve 's away  Caesar  Octavius Caesar  and Antony have ever won  More in their officer than person Sossius  One of my place in Syria his lieutenant  For quick accumulation of renown  Which he atchiev'd by th' minute lost his favour  Who does i' th' wars more than his captain can  Becomes his captain's captain  and ambition  The soldier's virtue rather makes choice of loss  Than gain which darkens him  I could do more to do Antonius good  But 't would offend him  and in his offence  Should my performance perish  SCENE II  Here follow two passages which for elegance of thought or beauty of expression it is not in the power of poetical imagery or language to exceed  When Octavia is taking leave of her brother Octavius Caesar with all the shews of a tender affection Antony says  The April's in her eyes  It is love's spring    And these the showers to bring it on  Be chearful  And afterwards when she endeavours to speak to him but cannot her difficulty is thus described  Antony  Her tongue will not obey her heart nor can  Her heart inform her tongue  the swan's down feather    That stands upon the swell at full of tide  And neither way inclines  SCENE V  Octavius upon seeing his sister returning in a private character to Rome without having afforded him timely notice to send forth a proper retinue to escort her says  Nay the dust  Should have ascended to the roof of Heaven  Raised by your populous troops but you are come  A marketmaid to Rome and have prevented  The ostentation of our love  which left unshewn    Is often left unloved  There is something more to be understood in this last sentiment than can be perceived on a careless perusal of it A warm affection within naturally inspires correspondent emotions without These are a sort of  setting  of the jewel which not only ornaments but helps to preserve it In all the refined passions the  delicacy  of a sentiment insures our constancy even more than the  strength  of it The nice observances the  petits soins  which in such cases may be almost deemed  petites morales  also increase the mutual pleasures and confidences of love and friendship They are the  comets  which feed the  sun  Even virtue itself all perfect as it is requires to be inspirited by passion for duties are but coldly performed which are  but philosophically  fulfilled  Octavius  to his Sister  Cheer your heart  Be not you troubled with the time which drives  O'er your content these strong necessities  But let determined things to  destiny  Hold unbewail'd their way  Here is very good advice given if by the word  destiny  be understood  Providence  which must certainly have been what the Antients meant by it whenever they had any meaning about it at all for most of the heathens made use of the expression as too many Christians often do of an higher one without affixing any manner of determinate idea to it in their minds But the old  wiseacres  were not satisfied to leave nonsense where they found it they picked up the common speech and elevated vulgar phrases into philosophical principles Hence the doctrines that  Nature  created the world and that  Fate  governed it c  SCENE VII  Here follows a thought which though false in the sentiment is but too true in the practice and which therefore all men should be taught to be aware of  Antony taking leave of his friends after his shameful flight at Actium  Pray ye look not sad  Nor make replies of loathnessTake the hint  Which my despair proclaims  Let them be left    Which leave themselves  As my gentle Readers may expect to be treated with a little of the  All for Love  of Antony in this Play I shall here quote a passage relative to this subject which we meet with in the present Scene  When Cleopatra appears before him after his defeat  Which was occasioned by his quitting the seafight at Actium to pursue Cleopatra's galley when it was sailing away  he addresses himself to her thus  O whither hast thou led me Aegypt See  How I convey my shame out of thine eyes  Turning from her  By looking back on what I've left behind  'Stroyed in dishonour  Cleopatra  Oh my lord my lord  Forgive my fearful sails I little thought  You would have followed  Antony  Aegypt thou knew'st too well  My heart was to thy rudder tied by th' string  Heartstring    And thou should'st tow me after O'er my spirit  Thy full supremacy thou knew'st and that  Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods  Command me  Cleopatra  Oh pardon pardon  Weeps  Antony  Fall not a tear I say one of them rates  All that is won and lostGive me a kiss  Even this repays me  Shakespeare in the above instance appears to have been more galant than Milton who does not suffer Adam to expostulate so mildly with Eve  "Out of my sight thou serpent"  Book x l  However we are to consider the infinite difference between the worlds that were lost upon those occasions But as I do not think that the first man was more excusable for following the advice than the other was for pursuing the galley of his mistress when such  prizes were at stake their resentments ought to have been expressed only against themselves  SCENE IX  The natural connection and dependance of the inward upon the outward man as it is here expressed is well marked in this place  When Antony in a fit of despair goes out to pen a personal challenge to Octavius the following reflection is made  Enobarbus  Yes like enough highbattled  Victorious  Caesar will  Unstate his happiness and be staged to th' shew  Against a sworder  I see men's judgments are  A parcel of their fortunes and things outward  Do draw the inward quality after them  To suffer all alike  That he should dream  Knowing all measures the full Caesar will  Answer his emptinessCaesar thou hast subdued  His judgment too  In this same Scene Enobarbus seeing the downfal of his master's fortunes enters into debate with himself whether he shall preserve his fidelity to him still or shift about and take part with the conqueror in which soliloquy he seems fairly to give the preference to the nobler side of the question in his argument though he afterwards determines against it in his conduct  But 'tis usually so in all deliberations of this sort for virtue and vice are of such opposite natures that there is no possibility of bringing them at all into comparison by any sophister whose judgment has not before been rendered partial and corrupt So that in such cases one may venture generally to pronounce as the Poet does of women that  they who deliberate are lost    Enobarbus  Mine honesty and I begin to square  To  square  to  quarrel  so used by Shakespeare    The loyalty well held to fools does make  Our faith mere follyYet he that can endure  To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord  Does conquer him that did his master conquer  And earns a place i' th' story  In fame or history    ACT IV  SCENE V  When Antony is told that Enobarbus had gone over to the enemy but left his chests and effects behind him he says  Go Eros send his treasure afterDo it  Detain no jot I charge theeWrite to him  I will subscribe gentle adieus and greetings  Say that I wish he never find more cause  To change a master Oh my fortunes have  Corrupted honest men Dispatch my Eros  There is such an heroic liberality of soul expressed here as must make one lament the misfortunes of the unhappy Antony even at this distance of time for the fact here represented is taken from historical record We may justly say of him as the soldier does here upon delivering the message to Enobarbus  Your emperor continues still a Jove  Antony was not only a braver and a greater but a better man than his competitor for empire Augustus was of a worthless mean jealous and vengeful nature though poets and  some historians  have deified him But princes will have their flatterers Milton has given one even to the  prince of darkness  See Beelzebub's compliments to Satan Book III    SCENE VI  Here Enobarbus appears to have been equally struck with the generosity of his master and his own vileness upon which joint reflection he passes a very just sentence on himself  I am alone the villain of the earth  And feel I am so most O Antony  Thou mine of bounty how wouldst thou have paid  My better service when my turpitude  Thou dost so crown with gold This blows  For  swells    my heart  If swift thought break it not a swifter mean  Shall outstrike thoughtBut thought will do't I feel  I fight against thee  No I will go seek  Some ditch where I may die the foul'st best fits  My latter part of life  SCENE VIII  The contrition of Enobarbus was sincere for here the strong sense of his baseness bursts his swoln heart  O bear me witness night  Be witness to me O thou blessed moon  When men revolted shall upon record  Bear hateful memory poor Enobarbus did  Before thy face repent  O sovereign mistress of true melancholy  The poisonous damp of night dispunge upon me  That life a very rebel to my will  May hang no longer on me  I have left out a passage here which only disgraces this fine speech  O Antony  Nobler than my revolt is infamous  Forgive me in thine own particular  But let the world rank me in register  A masterleaver and a fugitive  Oh Antony Oh Antony  Dies  I shall not pretend to dispute a knowledge of human nature with Shakespeare but if he had not given us a representation of this character I should hardly have been brought to imagine that a breast capable of harbouring such treachery and vileness could ever at the same time have contained a spirit of so much honour and so strong a sense of shame  One of the centinels upon seeing him sink down on the ground says to his companion that he has fallen asleep but the other who had overheard his soliloquy replies very justly  Swoons rather  for so bad a prayer as his  Was never yet for sleep  SCENE XI  In this place our Author describes the vicissitudes of life and the quick shiftings of fortune by an apt and beautiful simile  Antony  and  Eros  Antony  Eros thou yet behold'st me  Eros  Ay noble lord  Antony  Sometime we see a cloud that's dragonish  A vapour sometimes like a bear or lion  A tower'd citadel a pendant rock  A forked mountain or blue promontory  With trees upon't that nod unto the world  And mock our eyes with air Thou 'st seen these signs  They are black Vesper's pageants  Eros  Ay my lord  Antony  That which is now a horse ev'n with a thought  The rack  This word is explained in my last note on Act IV of the Tempest here it means only the dissolution of a cloud  dislimns and makes it indistinct  As water is in water  Eros  It does my Lord  Antony  My good knave  Knave  an old English expression for a servant or attendant  Eros now thy captain is  Ev'n such a bodyHere I'm Antony  Yet cannot hold this visible shape my knave  The rest of the speech is affecting but relates not to the description  ACT V  SCENE V  We meet with nothing in this Act worth noting except a speech made by one of Shakespeare's  inspired Clowns  in this Scene  I know that a woman is a dish for the Gods if the Devil dress her not  Milton's fine compliment to the sex is only This expressed with more politeness  O fairest of creation last and best  Of all God's works  But the Clown's expression has a peculiar propriety in it here as being applied to Cleopatra whose vices had  demonised  such distinguished talents and transcendent beauty as her's  CYMBELINE  Dramatis Personae  MEN  JACHIMO  BELLARIUS  GUIDERIUS  ARVIRAGUS  CLOTEN  PISANIO  LUCIUS  WOMEN  IMOGEN  CYMBELINE  ACT I SCENE VIII  WHEN the insidious Jachimo drops mysterious hints to the guileless Imogen that he is possessed of some secret relative to her husband which he hesitates to reveal she urges him to the discovery of it in these words  You do seem to know  Something of me or what concerns me Pray you  Since doubting things go ill often hurts more  Than to be sure they do for certainties  Or are past remedies or timely known  The remedy's then born discover to me  What both you spur and stop  The nature of the human mind is well shewn here it presses still to know the worst of every apprehended evil though not on account of the argument above proposed which is rather ingenious than just but merely to satisfy the impatience and relieve the suspence of doubt Providence has certainly a design in every kind of impression it makes upon its creatures and the reason that Imogen gives here may perhaps be its true one in this case but what I contend for is That such a reflection is not the real source of our curiosity upon these occasions Philosophy may serve to govern our impulses but is incapable of inspiring them  ACT III  SCENE III  The Reader will require no assistance to note the morality of the reflections in the following speech as he goes along and will also be able to recollect the several observations already made upon many similar ones on the same reconciling subject in the foregoing part of this Work  Bellarius speaking to his two pupils Guiderius and Arviragus concealed princes as they are going ahunting  Now for our mountain sport up to yon hill  Your legs are young I'll tread these flatsConsider  When you above perceive me like a crow  That it is  place  which lessens and sets off  And you may then revolve what tales I told you  Of courts of princes of the tricks in war  Where service is not service so being done  But being so allow'd To apprehend thus  Draws us a profit from all things we see  And often to our comfort shall we find  The sharded beetle  Shards  are clefts in timber between which the beetle is hatched  in a safer hold  Than is the fullwinged eagle Oh this life  Is nobler than attending for a check  Richer than doing nothing for a bauble  Earning titles or ribbands by mean adulation or court subserviency    Prouder than rustling in unpaidfor silk  Such gain the cap of him that makes them  fine    Yet keeps his book uncross'd  Unpaid  No life to ours  In the same Scene this subject is renewed again by the same speaker with further instances and richer reflections  Did you but know the city's usuries  And felt them knowingly the art o' th' court  As hard to leave as keep whose top to climb  Is certain falling or so slippery that  The fear's as bad as falling the toil of war  A pain that seems to seek out danger  I' th' name of same and honour which dies i' th' search  And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph  As record of fair act nay many time  Doth ill deserve by doing well what's worse  Must curt'sy at the censure  SCENE IV  Pisanio speaking of slander says  Whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue  Outvenoms all the worms of  Nile  whose breath  Rides on the posting winds and doth belye  All corners of the world Kings queens and states  Maids matrons nay the secrets of the grave  This viperous slander enters  The above passage needs no comment but what every Reader's experience either in his own case or that of others may enable him to supply  In the same Scene which is a forest Imogen upon reading her mistaken husband's mandate to Pisanio requiring him to put her to death on a presumption of her having been false to his bed thus exclaims  False to his bed  What is it to be false  To lie in watch there and to think on him  To weep 'twixt clock and clock If sleep charge nature  To break it with a fearful dream of him  And cry myself awake That's false to's bed is't  Nothing in situation of circumstance in thought or expression can exceed the beauty or tender effect of the above passage It catches such quick hold of our sympathy that we feel as if the scene was real and are at once transported amidst the gloom and silence of the forest in spite of all the glare of the Theatre and the loud applause of the audience It is in such instances as these that Shakespeare has never yet been equalled and can never be excelled What a power of natural sentiment must a man have been possessed of who could so adequately express that kind of ingenuous surprize upon such a challenge which none but a woman can possibly feel Shakespeare could not only assume all characters but even their sexes tooThis whole Scene is beautiful but falls not within our rule to transcribe any more of it here The Commentators are all dumb upon this fine passagenot silent in admiration but frozen into scholastic apathy One may say of such cold critics on Shakespeare what Addison does of lukewarm Christians  That  they want parts to be devout  and could as soon make an epic poem as a fervent prayer  SCENE VII  The following speech includes too many different articles in it to be comprehended under any one general head but the Reader will note the several particulars of it in the perusal  Imogen in boy's cloaths travelling alone through the forest makes this soliloquy  I see a man's life is a tedious  Tedious  for  fatiguing    one  I've tired myself and for two nights together  Have made the ground my bed  I should be sick    But that my resolution helps me Milford  When from the mountain top  Pisanio  shewed thee  Thou wast within a ken  O Jove  I think  Foundations fly the wretched  Such I mean  Where they should be relieved Two beggars told me  I could not miss my way Will poor folks lye  That have afflictions on them  knowing 'tis  A punishment or trial  Yes no wonder  When rich ones scarce tell true To lapse in fulness  Is sorer than to lye for need and falsehood  Is worse in kings than beggars  My dear lord  Thou'rt one o' th' false ones  Now I think on thee    My hunger's gone  but even before I was  At point to seek for food But what is this  Seeing a cave  Here is a path to't'Tis some savage hold  It were best not callI dare not callYet  famine    Ere clean it o'erthrow nature makes it valiant  Plenty and peace breed cowards hardness ever  Of hardiness is mother  ACT IV  SCENE III  There is a true spirit of natural bravery expressed here When Cloten meets Guiderius in the forest and challenges him to yield himself a prisoner he replies  To whom To thee What art thou Have not I  An arm as big as thine A heart as big  Thy words I grant are bigger  for I wear not  My dagger in my mouth  Say what thou art  Why I should yield to thee  Cloten  Art not afraid  Guiderius  Those that I reverence those I fear the wise  At fools I laugh not fear them  SCENE IV  After  Guiderius  has slain  Cloten  in fight his brother  Arviragus  says he envies him the action and wishes for some such trial of danger to exercise his own spirit upon On this occasion old Bellarius makes the following reflection  O thou goddess  Thou divine Nature how thyself thou blazon'st▪  In these two princely boys They are as gentle  As zephyrs blowing beneath the violet  Not wagging his sweet head  and yet as  ough  Their royal blood enchaf'd  as th' rudest wind    That by the top doth take the mountain pine  And make him stoop to th' vale  'Tis wonderful  That an invisible instinct should frame them  To royalty unlearn'd honour untaught  Civility not seen from other valour  That wildly grows in them but yields a crop  As if it had been sowed  The notion here expressed is one of the many antient pieces of superstition that modern philosophy has finally destroyed The lion has long since lost its instinct for princes as well as for virgins Human nature is the same throughout it is education alone that distinguishes man from man There are indeed great differences often observable between the talents and intellects of the species but this distinction is remarked in  individuals  only not in the  classes  of mankind  SCENE V  But though I dispute the argument of  Bellarius  in the last Scene I allow him perfectly right in this one where on giving order for the funeral of  Cloten  he says  He was a queen's son boys  And though he came our enemy remember  He was paid for that though mean and mighty rotting  Together have one dust  yet reverence    That angel of the world  Reverence  or a due regard to subordination keeps peace and order in the world  Johnson  doth make distinction  Of place 'twixt high and low  Our foe was princely  And though you took his life as being our foe  Yet bury him as a prince  As I do not meet with any thing further in this Play for my purpose except a few thoughts which are better expressed in former places already taken notice of I shall here conclude my quotations and remarks on this Piece  TROILUS AND CRESSIDA  Dramatis Personae  MEN  AGAMEMNON  NESTOR  ULYSSES  ACHILLES  AENEAS  ALEXANDER Squire to Cressida  WOMEN  CRESSIDA  TROILUS and CRESSIDA  ACT I  SCENE III  THE description of Ajax in this Play is worth transcribing as being humorous in itself agreeing with the representation of him in the Iliad and because it may be applied also in part to many and in the whole to a few medley characters that are frequently to be met with in life  Alexander  to  Cressida  This man lady hath robbed many beasts of their particular additions He is as valiant as the lion churlish as the bear slow as the elephant a man into whom Nature hath so crouded humours that his valour is crusted into folly his folly sauced with discretion there is no man hath a virtue that he has not a glimpse of nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it He is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair he hath the joints of every thing but every thing so out of joint that he is a gouty  Briareus  many hands and no use or purblind  Argus  all eyes and no sight  SCENE IV  Cressida's speech here in reference to her wooer Troilus contains very just reflections and prudent maxims for the conduct of women in the dangerous circumstance of love What she says would become the utterance of the most virtuous matron though her own character in this piece is unluckily a bad one But our Author's genius teemed so fertile in document that he was unable to restrain its impulse and coolly wait for a fit opportunity of adapting the speaker to the speech Shakespeare's faults arise from richness not from poverty they exceed not fall short his monsters never want a head but have sometimes two  Yet hold I offWomen are angels wooing  Things won are done joy's soul lies in the doing  That she beloved knows nought that knows not this  Men prize the thing ungained more than it is  That she  Tha  she  that is the woman  was never yet that ever knew  Love got so sweet as when desire did sue  Therefore this maxim out of love I teach  At  hievement is command ungained beseech  For  beseeching      Then though my heart's content  Content  for  capacity    Warburton  firm love doth bear  Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear  SCENE V  The following dialogue can hardly be thought too long by those Readers who carefully attend to the several admirable reflections comprehended in it upon the dilatory nature of great events the necessity of patience and fortitude with the expediency of deference and obedience to order and authority  A Council held in the  Grecian  Camp    Agamemnon  Princes  What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks  The ample proposition that hope makes  In all designs begun on earth below  Fails in the promised largeness Checks and disasters  Grow in the veins of actions highest reared  As knots by the conflux of meeting sap  Infect the sound pine and divert his grain  Tortive and errant from his course of growth  Nor princes is it matter new to us  That we come short of our suppose so far  That after seven years siege yet  Troy  walls stand  Sith every action that hath gone before  Whereof we have record trial did draw  Bi  s and thwart not answering the aim  And that  unbodied figure of the thought    That gav't surmised shape Why then ye princes  Do you with cheeks abashed behold our works  And think them shame which are indeed nought else  But the protractive trials of great Jove  To find persistive constancy in man  The fineness of which metal is not found  In fortune's love for then the bold and coward  The wise and fool the artist and unread  The hard and soft seem all affined and kin  But in the  ind and tempest of her frown  Distinction with a broad and powerful fan  Puffing at all winnows the light away  And what hath mass or matter by itself  Lies rich in virtue and unmingled  Nestor  In the reproof of chance  Lies the true proof of men The sea being smooth  How many shallow bauble boats dare sail  Upon her patient breast making their way  With those of nobler bulk  But let the ruffian  Boreas  once enrage  The gentle  Thetis  and anon behold  The strongribb'd bark thro' liquid mountains cut  Bounding between the two moist elements  Like Perseus' horse  When he rode through the air and clouds to rescue  Andromeda    Where's then the saucy boat  Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now  Corivall'd greatnessOr to harbour fled  Or made a toast for  Neptune  Even so  Doth valour's shew and valour's worth divide  In storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness  The herd hath more annoyance by the brize  Brize  the  gadfly    Than by the tyger but when splitting winds  Make flexible the knees of knotted oaks  And flies get under shade why then the thing of courage  Sir Thomas Hanmer says  from his own authority  that tygers are fiercest in high winds    As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize  And with an accent tuned in selfsame key  Returns to chiding fortune  Ulysses  Troy yet upon her basis had been down  And the great  Hector  's sword had lack'd a master  But for these instances  The speciality of rule hath been neglected  And look how many  Grecian  tents do stand  Hollow upon this plain  so many hollow factions    When that the general is not like the hive  To whom the foragers shall all repair  What honey is expected Degree  being vizarded  The unworthiest shews as fairly in the mask  The heavens themselves the planets and this center  Observe degree priority and place  Insisture course proportion season form  Office and custom in all line of order  And therefore is the glorious planet  Sol  In noble eminence enthroned and sphered  Amidst the rest whose med'cinable eye  Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil  And posts like the commandment of a king  Sans check to good or bad But when the planets  In evil mixture to disorder wander  What plagues and what portents what mutiny  What raging of the sea shaking of earth  Commotion in the winds frights changes horrors  Divest and crack rend and deracinate  The unity and married calm of states  Quite from their fixture So when  degree  is shaken  Which is the ladder to all high designs  Then enterprize is sick How could communities  Degrees in schools and  Corporate bodies  brotherhoods in cities  Peaceful commerce from dividable shores  The primogeniture and due of birth  Prerogative of age crowns scepters laurels  But by degree stand in authentic place  Take but degree away untune that string  And hark what discord follows Each thing meets  In mere oppugnancy The bounded waters  Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores  And make a sop of all this solid globe  Strength should be lord of imbecillity  And the rude son should strike his father dead  Force should be right or rather right and wrong  Between whose endless jar justice resides  Should lose their names and so should justice too  Then every thing include itself in power  Power into will will into appetite  And appetite an universal wolf  So doubly seconded with will and power  Must make perforce an universal prey  And last eat up itself Great  Agamemnon    This chaos when degree is suffocate  Follows the choking  And this neglection of degree is it  That by a pace goes backward with a purpose  It has to climb The general's disdained  By him one step below he by the next  That next by him beneath so every step  Exampled by the first pace that is sick  Of his superior grows to an envious fever  Of pale and bloodless  Bloodless  more malignant than active  emulation  And 'tis this fever that keeps  Troy  on foot  Not her own sinews To end a tale of length  Troy  in our weakness lives not in her strength  To which Ulysses further on in the same Scene adds  They tax our policy and call it cowardice  Count wisdom as no member of the war  Forestall our prescience and esteem no act  But that of handThe still and mental parts  That do contrive how many hands shall strike  When fitness calls them on and know the measure  By their observant toil of th' enemy's weight  Why this hath not a finger's dignity  They call this bedwork mappery closetwar  So that the ram that batters down the wall  For the great swing and rudeness of its poize  They place before his hand that made the engine  Or those that with the fierceness of their souls  By reason guide its execution  May I venture here to challenge any thing in the Iliad where the same argument is deliberated upon by the same chiefs with Homer's gods to assist their counsels to equal the justness of observation the richness of imagery and the copiousness of reflection presented to us in this resplendent passage But as I said before on a comparison between Shakespeare and Sophocles 'tis enough to determine the literary critics against me that  one had written in English and the other in Greek    SCENE VI  In this place is given us a specimen of the antient chivalry as first inspired by love and galantry and exercised in honour or defence of women  Aeneas  attended by an herald bringing a challenge from  Hector  to any champion in the  Grecian  camp who will accept it delivers himself thus  Kings princes lords  If there be one amongst the fair'st of  Greece    That holds his honour higher than his ease  That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril  That knows his valour and knows not his fear  That loves his mistress more than in profession  With truant vows to her own lips he loves  And dare avow her beauty and her worth  In other arms than hers to him this challenge  Hector  in view of  Trojans  and of  Greeks    Shall make it good or do his best to do it  He hath a lady wiser fairer truer  Than ever  Greek  did compass in his arms  And will tomorrow with his trumpet call  Midway between your tents and wall of  Troy    To rouse a  Grecian  that is true in love  If any come  Hector  shall honour him  If none he'll say in  Troy  when he retires  The  Grecian  dames are sunburned and not worth  The splinter of a lance Even so much  To which  Agamemnon  replies  This shall be told our lovers lord  Aeneas    If none of them have soul in such a kind  We've left them all at home But we are soldiers  And may that soldier a mere recreant prove  That means not hath not or is not in love  If then one is or hath or means to be  That one meets  Hector  if none else I'm he  Old  Nestor  's speech upon this occasion is well worth adding here both for the humour of his expressions and to compleat the idea of  knighterrantry  in which profession of arms neither difference of age or other imparity whatsoever were allowed to be pleaded as exemptions by the laws of such romantic chivalry  Tell him of  Nestor  one that was a man  When  Hector  's grandsire suckt he is old now  But if there be not in our  Grecian  host  One noble man that hath one spark of fire  To answer for his love tell him from me  I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver  And in my vantbrace▪ put this withered brawn  And meeting him will tell him that my lady  Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste  As may be in the worldHis youth in flood  I'll pawn this truth with my three drops of blood  ACT II SCENE VIII  The last passage in this Scene contains a good stricture against pride though somewhat too quaintly expressed in the first and last part of the proposition  Vantbrace  a shield or buckler  Agamemnon  He that is proud eats up himself Pride is his own glass his own trumpet his own chronicle and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours the deed in the praise  Of all the faults of men their pride is apt to give us most offence perhaps because it hurts our own  I am not sure but this has been said by somebody else before    ACT III SCENE VII  The following speech may very well take  Ecce mundum  for its motto as 'tis full of melancholy and mortifying truths But I don't think the philosophic and humiliating reflections it contains become the character of the speaker as given us by Homer Achilles on seeing the Grecian chiefs pass by his tent without taking notice of him says to Patroclus  What am I poor of late  'Tis certain greatness once fallen out with fortune  Must fall out with men too what the declined is  He shall as soon read in the eyes of others  As feel in his own fall for men like butterflies  Shew not their mealy wings but to the summer  And not a man for being simply man  Hath any honour but honour by those honours  That are without him as place riches favour  Prizes of accident as oft as merit  Which when they fall as being slipp'ry standers  The love that leaned on them as slipp'ry too  Doth one pluck down another and together  Die in the fall  In the latter end of the same Scene the investigating faculties necessary for a Minister with the  arcana imperii  or mysteries of government are strongly and poetically described  Ulysses  The providence that's in a watchful state  Knows almost every grain of Pluto's gold  Acquainted with all the resources of trade commerce or finances    Finds bottom in th' incomprehensive deep  Keeps place with thought and almost like the gods  Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles  There is a mystery with which relation  Recital explanation or comment  Durst never meddle in the soul of state  Which hath an operation more divine  Than breath or pen can give expressure to  ROMEO AND JULIET  Dramatis Personae  MEN  ROMEO  BENVOLIO  FRIAR LAWRENCE  WOMEN  NONE  ROMEO and JULIET  WERE it my province to have selected the poetical beauties of our Author there are few of his Plays that would have furnished me more amply than this The language abounds with tenderness and delicacy and seems to breathe the soul of youthful fondness but neither the fable nor the dialogue can afford much assistance toward my present purpose as the first is founded on a vicious prejudice unknown to the liberal minds of Britons that of entailing family feuds and resentments down from generation to generation and the second as far at least as the lovers are concerned though poetical and refined is dictated more by passion than by sentiment  But as my young Readers might not forgive my passing over this Play unnoticed I shall just observe that the catastrophe of the unhappy lovers seems intended as a kind of moral as well as poetical justice for their having ventured upon an unweighed engagement together without the concurrence and consent of their parents See my reflection on the first Scene Act I  Midsummer Night's Dream  where this duty and obedience is both enforced and restrained  ACT I SCENE II  The first passage worthy of remark that occurs is the following definition or description of that passion which with respect to the generality of mankind frames the happiness or misery of their lives  Romeo  and  Benvolio  Benvolio  Alas that love so gentle in his view  Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof  Romeo  Why then O brawling love O loving hate  Oh any thing of nothing first create  O heavy lightness serious vanity  Mishapen Chaos of wellseeming forms  Feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health  Still waking sleep that is not what it is  Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs  Being purged a fire sparkling in lover's eyes  Being vext a sea nourish'd with lover's tears  What is it else A madness most discreet  A choking gall and a preserving sweet  ACT II SCENE III  The allegory here drawn from a comparison of the qualities of herbs with the nature of man is just ingenious and poetical  Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket in order to cull simples for medicinal uses  The greyeyed morn smiles on the frowning night  Check'ring the eastern clouds with streaks of light  And darkness fleckered like a drunkard reels  From forth day's path and  Titan's  burning wheels  Now ere the sun advance his burning eye  The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry  I must fill up this osiercage of ours  With baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers  The earth that's Nature's mother is her tomb  What is her burying grave that is her womb  And from her womb children of divers kind  We sucking on her natural bosom find  Many for many virtues excellent  None but for some and yet all different  O mickle is the powerful grace that lies  In plants herbs stones and their true qualities  Nor nought so vile that on the earth doth live  But to the earth some special good doth give  Nor aught so good but strained from that fair use  Revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse  Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied  And vice sometimes by action's dignified  Within the infant rind of this small flower  Poison hath residence and medicine power  For this being smelt with that sense cheers each part  Being tasted slays all senses with the heart  Two such opposed fees encamp them still  In man as well as herbs grace and rude will  And where the worser is predominant  Fullsoon the canker death eats up that plant  In the same Scene when  Romeo  comes to acquaint the  Friar  that his former flame for the fair  Rosaline  is extinct  This hint of Romeo's infidelity is left out in the modern representation of this Play  and a new one for Juliet like another  phoenix  had arisen out of its ashes the honest priest thus exclaims  Holy  St Francis  what a change is here  Is  Rosaline  whom thou didst love so dear  So soon forsaken Young men's love then lies  Not truly in their hearts but in their eyes  Holy  St Francis  What a deal of brine  Hath washed thy sallow cheeks for  Rosaline  How much saltwater thrown away in waste  To season love that of it doth not taste  The sun not yet thy sighs from Heaven clears  Thy old groans ring yet in my antient ears  Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit  Of an old tear that is not washed off yet  If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine  Thou and these woes were all for  Rosaline    And art thou changed Pronounce this sentence then  Women may fall when there's no strength in men  With this very just reflection I shall here conclude my notes upon this Play the remainder of it affording but little matter for further observation being mostly action narration and confusion But if my Readers should require some apology to be made for the quick conception of passion in the character of Juliet I must refer them to my Preface to Scene IV Act I of  The Taming of the Shrew    HAMLET  Dramatis Personae  MEN  HAMLET  KING  POLONIUS  LAERTES  HORATIO  ROSINCRANTZ  REYNOLDO  WOMEN  QUEEN  OPHELIA  PLAYERS  HAMLET  ACT I  SCENE II  IF reasoning could controul our grief the King and Queen offer sufficient arguments to Hamlet in this Scene to moderate his  Good Hamlet cast thy nighted colour off  And let thine eyes look like a friend on Denmark  Do not for ever with thy veiled lids  Seek for thy noble father in the dust  Thou know'st 'tis common all that live must die  Passing through nature to eternity  The King then takes up the subject and enlarges on it  'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature Hamlet  To give these mourning duties to your father  But you must know your father lost a father  That father his and the survivor bound  In filial obligation for some term  To do obsequious  The word here is framed from  obsequies  or  funeral rites    Johnson  sorrow But to persevere  In obstinate condolement  Condolement  for  sorrow  because it requires  condolement    Warburton  is a course  Of impious stubbornness unmanly grief  It shews a will most incorrect to heaven  A heart unfortified a mind impatient  An understanding simple and unschool'd  For what we know must be and is as common  As any the most vulgar thing to sense  Why should we in our peevish opposition  Take it to heart Fie 'tis a fault to heaven  A fault against the dead a fault to nature  To reason most absurd whose common theme  Is death of fathers and who still have cryed  From the first corse 'till he that died today  This must be so  SCENE V  In this Scene Laertes gives most excellent advice and  matronly  caution to his sister upon the subject of Hamlet's addresses to her  For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour  Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood  A violet in the youth of primy nature  Forward not permanent tho' sweet not lasting  The perfume and suppliance of a minute  No more Think it no more  For Nature crescent does not grow alone  In thews  Thews and bulk  ▪ synonimous  and bulk but as this temple waxes  The inward service of the mind and soul  Grows wide withal Perhaps he loves you now  And now no soil nor cautel  Ca  el  This w  rd from the Latin  cautela  signifies simply  caution  but by the abuse of langu  ge is th  ught here to mean    doth besmirch  The virtue of his will but you must fear  Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain  If with too credent ear you list his songs  Or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open  To his unmastered importunity  Fear it Ophelia fear it my dear sister  And keep within the rear of your affection  Out of the shot and danger of desire  The chariest maid is prodigal enough  If she unmask her beauty to the moon  Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes  The canker galls the infants of the spring  Too oft before their buttons  Button  or  g  rmen  of a plant  be disclosed  And in the morn and liquid dew of youth  Contagious blas  ments are most eminent  Be wary then best safety lies in fear  Y  th to itself rebels though none else near  SCENE VI  Polonius on his son's going to travel gives him admirable rules and instructions for his conduct in life  My blessing with you  And these few precepts in thy memory  See thou character Give thy thoughts no tongue  Nor any unproportioned thought his act  Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar  The friends thou hast and their adoption tryed  Grapple them to thy soul with clasps of steel  But do not dull thy palm with entertainment  Of each newhatch'd unfledg'd comrade Beware  Of entrance to a quarrel but being in  Bear't that th' opposer may beware of thee  Give every man thine ear but few thy voice  Take each man's censure but reserve thy judgment  Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy  But not expressed in fancy rich not gaudy  For the apparel oft proclaims the man  Neither a borrower nor a lender be  For borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry  And loan oft loses both itself and friend  I have ventured to transpose these two lines to avoid confusion in the argument    This above allTo thine own self be true  And it must follow as the light the day  The text says the  night  the dayWarburton has made the alteration much to the advantage of the passage    Thou can'st not then be false to any man  In the continuation of this Scene  Polonius  renews the same topic with his daughter that her brother had begun with her in the former which is urged with higher authority and enforced by additional arguments I shall give the dialogue as it stands  Polonius  What is't Ophelia  he  hath said to you  Laertes  Ophelia  So please you something touching the lord  Hamlet    Polonius  Marry well bethought  'Tis told me he hath very oft of late  Given private time to you and you yourself  Have of your audience been most free and bounteous  If it be so as so 'tis put on me  And that in way of caution I must tell you  You do not understand yourself so clearly  As it behoves my daughter and your honour  What is between you give me up the truth  Ophelia  He hath my lord of late made many tender  Of his affection to me  Polonius  Affection Pugh you speak like a green girl  Unsifted in such perilous circumstance  Do you believe his  tenders  as you call them  Ophelia  I do not know my lord what I should think  Polonius  Marry I'll teach you Think yourself a baby  That you have ta'en his  tenders  for true pay  Which are not sterling  Tender  yourself more dearly  Or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase  Wronging it thus you'll  tender  me a fool  Ophelia  My lord he hath importuned me with love  In honourable fashion  Polonius  Ay fashion you may call 'tGo to go to  Ophelia  And hath giv'n countenance to his speech my lord  With almost all the holy vows of Heaven  Polonius  Ay springes to catch woodcocks  I do know  When the blood burns how prodigal the soul  Lends the tongue vows These blazes oh my daughter  Giving more light than heat extinct in both  Ev'n in the promise as it is a making  You must not take for fire From this time  Be somewhat scantier of thy maiden presence  Set your intreatments at an higher rate  Than a command to parley For lord  Hamlet    Believe so much in him that he is young  And with a larger tether  With a freer scope  he may walk  Than may be given you In few  Ophelia    Do not believe his vows for they are brokers  Not of that die which their investments shew  But mere implorers of unholy suits  Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds  Bawds  instead of  bands  Theobald This alteration gives an obvious sense to the passage and saves the expence of a comment with which a text should never be encumbered unless it may no otherwise be rendered intelligible    The better to beguile This is for all  I would not in plain terms from this time forth  Have you so slander any moment's leisure  As to give words or talk with the lord  Hamlet    Look to 't I charge you  SCENE VII  I shall here quote what  Hamlet  says against the vice of drinking as it may suit the latitude of England as well as that of Denmark  Horatio  Is it a custom  Hamlet  Ay marry is 't  But to my mind though I am native here  And to the manner born it is a custom  More honoured in the breach than the observance  This  heavyheaded revel  east and west  Makes us traduced and taxed of other nations  They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase  Soil our addition and indeed it takes  From our achievements though performed at height  The pith and marrow of our attribute  As our natural bravery is often imputed to our  potvaliantry      From hence the speaker takes occasion to extend his reflection into a general observation which most people's experience may enable them to support that some accidental peculiarity of mind of manners nay even of features have often hurt the characters and marred the fortunes of particular persons of intrinsic worth and merit  So oft it chances in particular men  That for some vicious mole of nature in them  As in their birth wherein they are not guilty  Since nature cannot chuse his origin  By the o'ergrowth of some complexion  Constitutional predominance    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason  Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens  The form of plausive manners that these men  Carrying I say the stamp of one defect  Being nature's livery or fortune's scar  Their virtues else be they as pure as grace  As infinite as man may undergo  Shall in the general censure take corruption  From that particular fault  The dram of base  Doth all the noble substance of worth out  To his own scandal  I shall leave the Reader to interpret this last passage to himself for though Theobald has amended the text so as to hint the meaning the sense of it is still left imperfect in the expression    SCENE VIII  There is something extremely remarkable and pleasing in the following part of the Ghost's speech to Hamlet here  But howsoever thou pursu'st this act  Taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive  Against thy mother aught leave her to Heaven  And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge  To prick and sting her  He repeats the same fond caution to him again in Act III Scene X  But look Amazement on thy mother sits  O step between her and her fighting soul  Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works  Speak to her  Hamlet    No Eastern sentiment inspired by the first beams of the Sun and refined by the sublimest morality of Confucius ever rose to so high a pitch as the tenderness expressed in these two passages toward his wifeeven after her crimes Have either the Greek or Latin masters of the Epic afforded us so beautiful an instance of forgiveness and of love subsisting even beyond the grave They have both of them presented us with scenes after death but compare the behaviour of  Dido  upon meeting  Aeneas  in the Elysian fields with this as being the most parallel passage I can recollect He had not been any thing near so culpable towards her as this queen had been to her husband and yet the utmost temper that the  heathen  Poet could bring his Ghost to upon that occasion was merely to be silent and not upbraid  in speech  though he makes her sufficiently mark her resentment by her  looks and behaviour    ACT II  SCENE I  Here  Polonius  gives some instructions to a person he is sending over to carry money to his son at Paris in which though he requires him to sift narrowly into the manner of life company and conversation of  Laertes  yet he does it with so becoming a tenderness and parental respect to the character of the young man as is extremely interesting and engaging  Polonius  and  Reynoldo  Polonius  You shall do marvellous wisely good Reynoldo  Before you visit him to make inquiry  Of his behaviour  Reynoldo  My lord I did intend it  Polonius  Marry well saidvery well saidLook you Sir  Inquire me first what  Danskers  Danes  are in Paris  And how and whowhat meansand where they keep  What company at what expence and finding  By this encompassment and drift of question  That they do know my son come you more near  Then your particular demands will touch it  Take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him  As thus I know his father and his friends  And in part himDo you mark this Reynoldo  Reynoldo  Ay very well my lord  Polonius  And in part him  But you may say not well  But if 't be he I mean he 's very wild  Addicted so and soAnd there put on him  What forgeries you please  Marry none so rank    As may dishonour himTake heed of that  But Sir such wanton wild and usual slips  As are companions noted and most known  To youth and liberty  SCENE II  Polonius  It seems it is as proper to our age  To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions  As it is common for the younger sort  To lack discretion  Upon this reflection Doctor  Johnson  says  This is not the remark of a weak man  It is not indeed but why should  Polonius  be deemed so He certainly speaks very good sense throughout though with the natural and  respectable  mixture of the old man in it which methinks as Addison says of  Cornaro  's  He wrote a treatise on  health and long life  at fourscore commended in the Spectator No  stile is an improvement to it As to the manner in which he describes Hamlet's madness in Scene IV following I take it to be only designed by  Shakespeare  in ridicule of the old pedantic mode of definitions or quaint distinctions in logic and philosophy the  categories predicaments  and  predicables  of the  Schools  used in those times There are  many instances of the same oblique strictures upon other subjects in our Author I have therefore ever thought this character mistaken and consequently misrepresented on the Stage by its being generally given to a comic actor  ACT III  SCENE II  The famous soliloquy of Hamlet here  To be or not to be  is so generally remembered and has been so often remarked upon that I might possibly be thought guilty of a neglect in passing it by without a comment But the subject is a hazardous one and therefore had better not be meddled with It might perhaps bear a discussion in philosophy but religion forbids any manner of debate upon it  SCENE III  Shakespeare  not only affords documents to real life but supplies them even to the mimic one as may be seen in this Scene where he makes  Hamlet  give instructions to Actors how they should perform their parts But as there is no moral to be extracted from the passage I shall not quote it here  But all these rules however excellent in themselves may be considered rather as strictures on bad performers than precepts for their reformation Actors like Poets must be born not made and  a receipt to form an Actor  may be considered in the same light with the one  to frame an Epic poem  It is not so much from want of  notion  as of  Nature  that so many of the  Dramatis Personae  are found to be deficient in the expression of sentiment and representation of character  Talents  are as necessary to Actors as  Genius  is to Authors if I may be allowed such a distinction of termsbut neither are to be acquired in the schools All Mr Garrick's  art  without his  nature  would produce no effect as may be seen in the many who  have  laboriously  but vainly attempted to copy him I have known persons capable of writing a part who were incapable of performing it Our Author himself was an instance of this inconsistency who though he formed the  rule  could not supply the  example    SCENE VI  In the Strollers' play here introduced where the Lady is said  to protest too much  the speech which the Duke her husband makes upon that occasion shews a perfect knowledge in the mind and manners of human nature  I do believe you think what now you speak  But what we do determine oft we break  Purpose is but the slave of memory  Of violent birth but poor validity  Which now like fruits unripe sticks on the tree  But fall unshaken when they mellow be  Most necessary 'tis that we forgot  To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt  This sentiment is improperly expressed but the meaning of the passage is that we think we may remit engagements made only to ourselves without a strain of conscience    What to ourselves in passion we propose  The passion ending doth the purpose lose  The violence of either grief or joy  Their own enactures with themselves destroy  Where joy most revels grief doth most lament  Grief joys joy grieves on slender accident  This world is not for aye nor is it strange  That e'en our loves should with our fortunes change  For 'tis a question left us yet to prove  Whether love leads fortune or else fortune love  The great man down you mark his fav'rite flies  The poor advanced makes friends of enemies  And hitherto doth love on fortune tend  For who not needs shall never lack a friend  And who in want a hollow friend doth try  Directly seasons him his enemy  But orderly to end where I begun  Our wills and fates do so contrary run  That our devices still are overthrown  Our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own  SCENE VII  There is something very affecting in the selfexpostulation entered into by  Hamlet  in this place  just before he proceeds to hold the conference with his mother  Soft now to my mother  O heart lose not thy nature let not ever  The soul of  Nero  enter this firm bosom  Let me be cruel  Cruel  for  sever    but not unnatural  I will speak daggers to her but use none  My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites  How in my words soever she be shent  Shent sentenced  or  condemned      To give them seals  To give them warrant or authority to execute justice  never my soul consent  The filial tenderness here expressed towards her is in the same generous strain with the conjugal one before taken notice of in the Ghost's speech  But howsoever thou pursuest this act  c  SCENE VIII  Upon the king's expressing an apprehension of some commotion in the State which might arise from  Hamlet  's madness Rosincrantz makes the following speech  The single and peculiar life is bound  With all the strength and armour of the mind  To keep itself from noyance but much more  That spirit on whose weal depends and rests  The lives of many The cease of majesty  Dies not alone but like a gulph doth draw  What's near it with it 'Tis a massy wheel  Fixt on the summit of the highest mount  To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things  Are mortified and adjoined which when it falls  Each small annexment petty consequence  Attends the boisterous ruin Ne'er alone  Did the king sigh but with a general groan  The reflections in the above speech contain a very just and political moral in them which ought to be opposed to all rebellious motions that may ever arise in the minds of a discontented people If after such a pause of deliberation it shall fail of producing its proper effect there must be sufficient  cause to suspect that the private advantage of individuals is more intended than the general one of the community I do not mean to plead here for the old and justly exploded doctrines of  passive obedience  and  nonresistance  but only to hint a distinction between reason and resentment between rebellion and defence  The following speech in the same Scene will supply its own reflections and morals without the assistance of a comment  King  Oh my offence is rank it smells to heaven  Pray I cannot  Though inclination be as sharp as't will  My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent  And like a man to double business bound  I stand in pause where I shall first begin  And both neglect What if this cursed hand  Were thicker than itself with brother's blood  Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens  To wash it white as snow Whereto serves mercy  But to confront the visage of offence  And what's in prayer but this twofold force  To be forestalled ere we come to fall  Or pardoned being down Then I'll look up  My fault is past But oh what form of prayer  Can serve my turn Forgive me my foul murder  That cannot be since I am still possessed  Of those effects for which I did the murder  My crown mine own ambition and my queen  May one be pardoned and retain th' offence  In the corrupted currents of this world  Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice  And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself  Buys out the law  But 'tis not so above  There is no shuffling there the action lies  In his true nature and we ourselves compelled  Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults  To give in evidence  What then What rests  Try what repentance can  What can it not  Yet what can it when one cannot repent  That is shew their penitence sincere by making  restitution      Oh wretched state O bosom black as death  Oh limed soul that struggling to be free  Art more engaged Help angels make assay  Bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel  Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe  All may be well  Kneels  After some time he rises and says  My words fly up my thoughts remain below  Words without thoughts will ne'er to Heaven go  SCENE X  In the latter end of the conference between Hamlet and his mother he makes a speech upon the power of custom which should be engraved on our hearts and be the matin soliloquy of our lives  Good night but go not to mine uncle's bed  Assume a virtue if you have it not  That monster custom who all sense doth eat  Of habit's devil is angel yet in this  That to the use of actions fair and good  He likewise gives a frock or livery  That aptly is put on Refrain tonight  And that shall lend a kind of easiness  To the next abstinence the next more easy  For use can almost change the stamp of nature  And master ev'n the devil or throw him out  With wond'rous potency  ACT IV  SCENE IV  The following speech of Hamlet contains a very philosophic reflection and is the proper sentiment of men who are not  brutes  in their nature and deserve to perish like them  What is a man  If his chief good and market of his time  Be but to sleep and feed A  beast  no more  Sure he that made us with such large discourse  With such investigating powers and faculties of reasoning    Looking before and after gave us not  That capability and godlike reason  To fust in us unused  SCENE V  When the Queen suffers Ophelia in her madness to be admitted to her presence lest her pitiable condition  might raise a tumult in the city she makes this soliloquy  Let her come in  To my sick soul as sin's true nature is  Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss  So full of artless jealousy is guilt  It spills itself in fearing to be spilt  A tainted conscience as the proverb says in other words is apt to betray itself    ACT V SCENE IV  Here follows the description of an obsequious empty but imposing character such as is frequently to be met with in life mostly in Courts or among those who by a modern unmeaning title are stiled  The TonVox et praeterea nihil  Virtue and vice sense and folly are the only just natural or adequate differences in mankind These made the first distinctions between men and ought still to preserve them    Hamlet speaking of Osrick  He did compliment with his dug before he sucked it Thus has he and many more of the same breed that I know the drossy age dotes on only got the  tune  of the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of yesty  From  yest  or  harm  In general it means  spumy  or  frothy    collection which carries them thro' and thro' the most fanned and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trials the bubbles are out  In the same Scene just before his going to engage with Laertes on the trial of skill Hamlet hints at one of those  forebodings  frequent in the human mind and already remarked upon in former places  Hamlet  to  Horatio  Thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heartBut 'tis no matter  Horatio  Nay my good lord  Hamlet  It is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving  Gaingiving  for  misgiving  A most extraordinary kind of  synonima  and only met with here  as would perhaps  trouble a woman    Horatio  If your mind dislike any thing obey it I will forestal their repair hither and say you are not fit  To which the gallant Hamlet replies with a manly and philosophic spirit  Hamlet  Not a whit we defy augury  There is a special Providence in the fall of a sparrow  Pope seems to have borrowed a hint from this passage where he says speaking of Providence  Who sees with equal eye as Lord of all  A hero perish or a sparrow fall  If it be now 'tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come  the readiness is all  Since no man knows aught of what he leaves what is't to leave betimes  This is in my opinion a much better speech than the one that Julius Caesar makes in our Author's Play under that title  Cowards die many times before their death  c  POSTSCRIPT  Shaftsbury speaking of Hamlet says  That piece of Shakespeare's which appears to have most affected English hearts and has perhaps been oftenest acted of any that have come upon our stage is almost one continued moral a series of deep reflections drawn from  one  mouth upon the subject of  one  single accident and calamity naturally fitted to move horror and compassion  It may be said of this Play if I mistake not that it has properly but  one  character or principal part It contains no adoration or flattery of  the sex  no ranting at the gods no blustering heroism nor any thing of that curious mixture of the fierce and tender which makes the hinge of modern tragedy and nicely varies it between the points of  love and honour    OTHELLO  Dramatis Personae  MEN  DUKE of Venice  OTHELLO  CASSIO  IAGO  BRABANTIO  RODORIGO  WOMEN  DESDEMONA  AEMILIA  OTHELLO  SHAKESPEARE has written three pieces on the subject of jealousy the Winter's Tale Cymbeline and this one besides the character of Ford in the Merry Wives But such was the richness of his genius that he has not borrowed a single thought image or expression from any one of them to assist him in any of the others The subject seems rather to have grown progressively out of itself to have inspired its own sentiments and have dictated its own language This Play in my opinion is very justly considered as the last and greatest effort of our Author's genius and may therefore be looked upon as the  chef d'oeuvre  of dramatic composition  How perfectly does Othello's conduct throughout correspond with Iago's description of it in the latter end of the First Act  The Moor is of a free and open nature  That thinks men honest who but seem to be so  Such a character is not uncommon in life whose virtues arising more from an excellence of nature than an exertion of philosophy is led to judge of others by itself and of course become the dupe of art and villainy  ACT I  SCENE IV  Othello here expresses a very just and liberal sense of a matrimonial connection  But that I love the gentle Desdemona  I would not my unhoused free condition  Put into circumscription and confine  For the sea's worth  SCENE IX  The argument between philosophy and feeling in cases of misfortune or grief is well debated here The Duke preaching patience to the father upon his daughter's elopement with the Moor says  Good Brabantio  Take up this mangled matter at the best  Men do their broken weapons rather use  Than their bare hands  When remedies are past the griefs are ended  By seeing the worst which late on hope depended  To mourn a mischief that is lost and gone  Is the next way to draw new mischief on  What cannot be preserved when fortune takes  Patience her injury a mockery makes  The robbed that smiles steals something from the thief  He robs himself who spends a bootless grief  Brabantio  So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile  We lose it not so long as we can smile  He bears the sentence well who nothing bears  But the free comfort which from thence he hears  Alluding to the homily usually made by a judge on passing sentence    But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow  That to pay grief must of poor patience borrow  These sentences to sugar or to gall  Being strong on both sides are equivocal  But words are words I never yet did hear  That the bruised heart was healed through the ear  I may possibly be reprehended by some severe moralists for noting the equipoise of such an argument as this In this instance indeed I confess that I act contrary to the usual tenor of document which always takes part on the  wise  side of a question But as I have said before  Last Part of Postscript to Julius Caesar with other passages referred to in the Notes  I do not think that ethic philosophy can ever be a gainer by overstraining the sinews of the human mind We ought neither to be votaries to the Cynic nor the Stoic sects We should not with Diogenes  follow Nature  in the mere animal sense of the expression nor with Zeno fly beyond it in the metaphysical one True  virtue has no extremes Its sphere extends not beyond the  Temperate  Zones It sleeps in the Frozen and but raves in the Torrid ones  SCENE X  I have before observed upon the exuberance of Shakespeare's document and moral He so much abounds in maxim and reflection that he appears frequently at a loss to find proper characters throughout even his own extensive drama sufficient to parcel them out to so that he is frequently obliged to make his fools talk sense and set his knaves apreaching An instance of the latter impropriety may be seen in the following passage which contains both sound philosophy and useful admonition But that it may have the better effect on my readers I wish that whenever they remember the speech they could contrive to forget the speaker  Rodorigo  What should I do I confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my  virtue  to amend it  Iago  Virtue a fig  'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus  Our bodies are our gardens to the which our wills are gardeners So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our will If the ballance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions  The plea that Rodorigo offers above for remaining still under the dominion of a lawless passion is framed upon a fatal error too prevalent in the world that  virtue  is a peculiar gift from Heaven granted  speciali gratiâ  as it were to particular and chosen persons Hence indolent minds are apt to conclude it a vain task to restrain their passions or resist their temptations without the supernatural aid of such an innate endowment Iago in his reply reasons very justly against this dangerous and discouraging doctrine of  partial grace  in support of which argument I shall  here add a passage from a modern writer who speaking on this subject says  The difficulties we apprehend more than those we find in the strife with all our passions is the only thing that prevents philosophy or virtue from being commonly attainable in general life What makes the difference between a chaste woman and a frail one  The one had struggled and the other not  Between a brave man and a coward  The one had struggled and the other not  An honest man and a knave  One had struggled the other not  The Posthumous Works of a late Celebrated Genius deceased    ACT II SCENE XIV  There is a good deal of afterwit reflection here which however may serve as a forewarning perhaps to some of my Readers Iago seeing Cassio desponding on being cashiered by Othello asks if he be hurt To which he replies  Cassio  Past all surgeryReputation reputation reputation  Oh I  ave lost the immortal part of me and what remains is bestial  Oh thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee DevilI will ask him for my post again and he shall tell me I am a drunkard Had I as many mouths as Hydra such an answer would stop them all To be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast Every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil  ACT III  SCENE V  The following passage will speak for itself  Iago  Good name in man or woman dear my lord  Is the immediate jewel of their souls  Who steals my purse steals trash 'tis something nothing  'Twas mine 'tis his and has been slave to thousands  But he that filches from me my good name  Robs me of that which not enriches him  And makes me poor indeed  In the same Scene Othello while his alarmed mind is struggling between confidence and conviction  delivers himself on the subject with a liberal and manly spirit  Think'st thou I'd make a life of jealousy  To follow still the changes of the moon  With fresh suspicions NoTo be once in doubt  Is once to be resolved Exchange me for a goat  When I shall turn the business of my soul  To such exsuffolate  Exsuffolate  buzzing  and blown surmises  He compares these whispered slanders to waterbubbles floating in the air    Matching thy inference 'Tis not to make me jealous  To say my wife is fair feeds well loves company  Is free of speech sings plays and dances well  Where virtue is these are most virtuous  Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw  The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt  For she had eyes and chose me  No Iago  I'll see before I doubt when I doubt prove  And on the proof there is no more but this  Away at once with love or jealousy  SCENE XII  It has often surprized me to find the character of Desdemona so much mistaken and slighted as it too generally is It is simple indeed but that is one of its merits for the simplicity of it is that of  innocence  not of  folly  In my opinion she seems to be as perfect a model of a wife as either this author or any other writer could possibly have framed She speaks little but whatever she says is sensible pure and chaste The remark she makes in this place on the alteration of Othello's manners towards her affords a very proper admonition to all women in her situation and circumstances  Something sure of state  Hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases  Men's natures wrangle with inferior things  Though great ones are their object 'Tis even so  For let our finger ake and it endues  Our other healthful members with a sense  Of pain  Nay we must think men are not gods    Nor of them look for such observance always  As fits the bridal  She had said to himself before  Be't as your fancies teach you  Whate'er you be I am obedient  And afterwards in confessing herself before Iago and Aemilia  Here I kneel  If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love  Or it discourse or thought or actual deed  Or th  t mine eyes mine ears or any sense  Delight  th  n on any other form  Or that I  and ever did  And ever will  ough he do shake me off  To beggarly divorcement love him dearly  Comfort forswear me Unkindness may do much  A  d  unkindness may defeat my life  But never  love  And further on where Aemilia says to her of Othello  I wish you had never seen him  She replies  So would not I  My love doth so approve him    That ev'n hi  stubbornnes  his checks and frowns  Have grace and favour in them  As the married state is both the dearest and most social connection of life I think this a proper passage to conclude my observations with on a work in which is comprehended the compleatest system of the oeconomical and moral duties of human nature that perhaps was ever framed by the wisdom philosophy or experience of  uninspired  man  A GENERAL POSTSCRIPT  THERE are many favourite passages in Shakespeare which most of my Readers have got by heart and missing here may possibly object to my having neglected to quote or observe upon them in their proper places But my intention in this Work was not to propound the beauties of the Poet but to expound the document of the Moralist throughout his writings  So far from being insensible to the other excellencies of this Author I have ever thought him by much the greatest poet of our nation for sublimity of idea and beauty of expression Perhaps I may even think myself guilty of some injustice in limiting his fame within the narrow confines of these kingdoms for upon a comparison with the much venerated names of Antiquity I am of opinion that we need not surrender the British Palm either to the Grecian Bay or the Roman Laurel with regard to the principal parts of poetry as thought sentiment or descriptionAnd though the dead languages are confessed to be superior to ours yet even here in the very article of diction our Author shall measure his pen with any of the antient  styles  in their most admired compound and decompound epithets descriptive phrases or figurative expressions  The multitudinous sea earpiercing fife big war giddy mast skyaspiring heavenkissing hill timehonoured name cloudcapt towers heavenlyharnessed team rash gunpowder polished perturbation gracious silence golden care trumpettongued thoughtexecuting fires  with  a number of other words both epic and comic are instances of it But with regard to the moral excellencies of our English  Confucius  either for beauty or number he undoubtedly challenges the wreath from the whole collective Host of Greek or Roman Writers whether ethic epic dramatic didactic or historic  Mrs Montagu says very justly that  We are apt to consider Shakespeare only as a poet but he is certainly one of the greatest moral philosophers that ever lived  And this is true because in his universal scheme of doctrine he comprehends manners proprieties and decorums and whatever relates to these to personal character or national description falls equally within the great line of morals Horace prefers Homer to all the philosophers  Qui quid sit pulchrum quid turpe quid utile quid non  Pleniùs et meliùs Chrysippo et Crantore dicit  And surely Shakespeare  pleniùs et meliùs  excels him again as much as the living scene exceeds the dead letter as action is preferable to didaction or representation to declamation  Example is better than precept A dramatic moral affords us the benefit of both at once Plato wished that Virtue could assume a visible form Dramatic exhibition gives one both to Virtue and to Vice The abstract idea is there materialized The contrast of character too affords an additional strength to the moral as we are led to love virtue on a double account by being made to abhor vice at the same time The dramatic moralist possesses a manifest advantage over the doctrinal one Mere descriptions of virtue or vice do not strike us so strongly as the visible representations of them Richard the Third's dream Lady Macbeth's soliloquy in her sleep the Dagger Scene in the same Play Cardinal Beaufort's last moments with many other passages in our Author of the same admonitory  kind avail us more than whole volumes of Tully's Offices or Seneca's Morals  In this scenic province of instruction our representations are much better calculated to answer the end proposed than those of the Antients were on account of the different hours of exhibition Theirs were performed in the morning which circumstance suffered the salutary effect to be worn out of the mind by the business or avocations of the day Ours are at night the impressions accompany us to our couch supply matter for our latest reflections and may sometimes furnish the subject of our very dreams  But Shakespeare seems to have extended his views still further by frequently interspersing allusions to the Scriptures throughout his writings I would not have the old  Mysteries  restored to the Stage nor should Dramatic Dialogue exceed into Sermons but I think that such occasional hints or passages as this Author has supplied when thrown in sparingly and introduced with discretion may sometimes serve to add a strength and dignity to the stile and subject of such compositions besides the advantage of producing perhaps effects of an higher nature by calling our attention to more serious reflections in the very midst of our pleasures and dissipations without sinking our spirits or damping our enjoyments awakening us to the contemplation of a religion so pure so equally free from the severities of discipline and the superstitions of devotion of a system of theology framed even as Man himself would chuse in fine of a faith and doctrine which has but stronger bound the social ties given an higher sanction to moral obligations and proved our duty to be our interest also  Having now arrived at the last page of my task I must confess the apprehensions I am sensible of on presenting to the Public a Work of so much difficulty and danger though with regard to the first of  these articles I acknowledge this to have been one in the class of those of which Ferdinand in the Tempest says  There be some sports are painful but their labour  Delight in them sets off  But in respect to the latter I must here throw myself not only upon the candor but the indulgence of my Readers hoping that the many failures in the execution may be pardoned on the single merit of the design  THE END
