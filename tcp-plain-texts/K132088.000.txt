 THE RIOT OR HALF A LOAF IS BETTER THAN NO BREAD IN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN JACK ANVIL AND TOM HOD  To the Tune of  "A Cobler there was" c  TOM  COME neighbours no longer be patient and quiet  Come let us go kick up a bit of a riot  I am hungry my lads but I've little to eat  So we'll pull down the mills and seize all the meat  I'll give you good sport boys as ever  saw  So a fig for the Justice a fig for the law  Derry down  Then his pitchfork Tom seiz'dhold a moment says Jack  I'll shew thee thy blunder brave boy in a crack  And if I don't prove we had better be still  I'll assist thee straitway to pull down every mill  I'll shew thee how passion thy reason does cheat  Or I'll join thee in plunder for bread and for meat  Derry down  What a whimsey to think thus our bellies to fill  For we stop all the grinding by breaking the mill  What a whimsey to think we shall get more to eat  By abusing the butchers who get us the meat  What a whimsey to think we shall mend our spare diet  By breeding disturbance by murder and riot  Derry down  Because I am dry 'twould be foolish I think  To pull out my tap and to spill all my drink  Because I am hungry and want to be fed  That is sure no wise reason for wasting my bread  And just such wise reasons for mending their diet  Are us'd by those blockheads who rush into riot  Derry down  I would not take comfort from others distresses  But still I would mark how God our land blesses  For tho' in Old England the times are but sad  Abroad I am told they are ten times as bad  In the land of the Pope there is scarce any grain  And 'tis still worse they say both in Holland and Spain  Derry down  Let us look to the harvest our wants to beguile  See the lands with rich crops how they every where smile  Mean time to assist us by each Western breeze  Some corn is brought daily across the salt seas  We'll drink little tea no whisky at all  But patiently wait and the prices will fall  Derry down  But if we're not quiet then let us not wonder  If things grow much worse by our riot and plunder  And let us remember whenever we meet  The more ale we drink boys the less we shall eat  On those days spent in riot  no  bread you brought home  Had you spent them in labour you must have had  Derry down  A dinner of herbs says the wise man with quiet  Is better than beef amid discord and riot  If the thing can't be help'd I'm a foe to all strife  And pray for a peace every night of my life  But in matters of state not an inch will I budge  Because I conceive I'm no very good judge  Derry down  But tho' poor I can work my brave boys with the best  Let the King and the Parliament manage the rest  I lament both the War and the Taxes together  Tho' I verily think they don't alter the weather  The King as I take it with very good reason  May prevent a bad law but can't help a bad season  Derry down  The Parliamentmen altho' great is their power  Yet they cannot contrive us a bit of a shower  And I never yet heard tho' our Rulers are wise  That they know very well how to manage the skies  For the best of them all as they found to their cost  Were not able to hinder last Winter's hard frost  Derry down  Besides I must share in the wants of the times  Because I have had my full share in it's crimes  And I'm apt to believe the distress which is sent  Is to punish and cure us of all discontent  But harvest is comingPotatoes will come  Our prospect clears up Ye complainers be dumb  Derry down  And tho' I've no money and tho' I've no lands  I've a head on my shoulders and a pair of good hands  So I'll work the whole day and on Sundays I'll seek  At church how to bear all the wants of the week  The Gentlefolks too will afford us supplies  They'll subscribeand they'll give up their puddings and pies  Derry down  Then before I'm induced to take part in a Riot  I'll ask this short questionWhat shall I get by it  So I'll e'en wait a little till cheaper the bread  For a mittimus hangs o'er each Rieters head  And when of two evils I'm ask'd which is best  I'd rather be hungry than be hang'd I protest  Derry down  Quoth Tom thou art right If I rise I'm a Turk  So he threw down his pitchfork and went to his work  Z  P  th Printed by R
