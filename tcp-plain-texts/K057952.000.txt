mind relief  I say life's pleasure wants alloy  And that the world has no such joy  As good substantial grief  Let all before us  Bear a chorus  Hum drum lackaday  Groan moan grunt away  Life's pleasures want alloy  In chorus thencry for joy  II  The wretch who hides his hoard with care  Jealous lest the very air  Should kiss the shining dross  Let some one but his treasure steal  Would he not more its value feel  When crying for its loss  Let all c  KING  Cry allthat's rightbe sorrier still and sorrier  But harkthe little great Tom Thumb that warrior  Like Titus justin cruelty a Nero

 Each time she chuses to be half seas over  AIR  Shall I such indignity  Oh what malignity  Who the pow'r regal have got all  Who am Landgrave and Margrave  And Lord Paramount  And a king and the devil knows what all  Shall I buckle to  A virago a shrew  Who in ev'ry point overreaches  No her pride shall come down  And I swear by my crown  Henceforth we'll ourself wear the breeches  SCENE VI  TOM THUMB NOODLE  TOM THUMB  Trust me my Noodle I am devilish qualmish  For tho' I'd rather hang or drown or famish  Than my true love should meet with a miscarriage  Yet can I never gulp that pill

While thy big heart that thumping seems to labour  Plays to that pipe thy tongue the merry tabor  AIR  To Thumb will I  This moment hie  Why should I longer tarry  When they're agreed  Lest worse succeed  Folks cannot too soon marry  Not that thy charms  From deeds of arms  Shall hold him or his duty  Heroes should burn  Alike in turn  For battle and for beauty  So mighty Jove  Has fall'n in love  And where's the mighty wonder  But when on earth  Once o'er his wish  He flies to wield the thunder  SCENE IX  HUNCAMUNCA GRIZZLE  HUNCAMUNCA  I'm like a soldier safe return'd from scrimmage  Or
