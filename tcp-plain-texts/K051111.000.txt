 THE FAIR CIRCASSIAN A TRAGEDY  Price  s    d    THE FAIR CIRCASSIAN A TRAGEDY AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL DRURYLANE  BY THE AUTHOR OF  SYMPATHY  A POEM  LONDON PRINTED FOR R BALDWIN NO PATERNOSTER ROW M DCC LXXXI  TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES  SIR  YOU are of an age when the heart opens to the most warm and generous impressions an age when all that gives worth and dignity to elevated rank takes full possession of the bosom At this bright and unprejudiced crisis of your life the precepts of Omar and the practice of Hamet as drawn by Hawkesworth and dramatised by the author of this tragedy will win upon your attention not indeed by the attraction of poetry but by the natural reverence which unspotted youth ever renders and with delight to faithful  representations of wisdom and of virtue the wisdom of the patriot the virtue of the prince  That your Royal Highness may very long reflect blessings on the people of England and prove a distinguished honour to the illustrious family who have that generous people in charge is the zealous prayer as it is the most empassioned expectation of  YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS's Most devoted And most dutiful servant THE AUTHOR  PREFACE  THIS tragedy borrows its general story and some of its incidents with as much of its sentiment as could be preserved from the very beautiful  "Almoran  and  Hamet"  of Hawkesworth Except that truth and justice call for such acknowledgement it would on any other score have been unnecessary for what can be added to the fame of a work universally celebrated The original  machinery  has been rejected because it would have been too daring an attempt to interweave it with the fable of a modern composition and perhaps too mighty a task to manage without violating the first great law of dramatick probability At the same time it has been the authour's most assiduous endeavour to "convert the sententious display of eastern wisdom as far as character would permit into the language of passion varied by every motive which might most forcibly affect the human mind in the most warm and interesting situations" These are the words of a critick who seems fully to have penetrated the design of the author The lines with inverted commas were omitted in the representation to favour the rapidity of the action They are retained  in the printed copy not more at the instance of particular friends than on general experience that those passages which retard the force of the passion on the theatre are frequently read with most satisfaction in the closet  The Play still continuing to be received on the stage with the most brilliant success the author would but half discharge the debt of equity were he to confess obligations to Hawkesworth only The liberal perhaps the unequalled support which the managers have afforded by the scenery the interesting manner in which Mr Linley has set the Epithalamium the taste of Mr De Loutherberg and the splendour which the performers have thrown over the characters by their EXCELLENT representation demand and receive the most warm and pointed expressions of gratitude There remains but one tribute of justice more and  that  is due to Mr Sheridan whose attention has on this occasion been friendship and whose assistance must always be fame  PROLOGUE  BY A FRIEND Spoken by Mr BANNISTER Jun  WITH trembling steps as if  suspicious  grown  Why doth the tragic muse approach her throne  Her  golden throne  where once with grace divine  The goddess sat  "supreme of all the nine"  Turns her fair palace to the festive bower  Where jest and sport usurp her nobler power  Lost is each lovelier feeling that imparts  To  her  the sovereign rule o'er British hearts  Sunk the pure taste which once secur'd her sway  Or wanes that virtue which admir'd her lay  Vain fears A generous race assembled here  Still pay to grief compassion's softest tear  Still pay the heartfelt sigh which Britons owe  To nature's feelings and to nature's woe  When jealous fiends  Othello  's heartstrings tear  When guilty  Richard  groans with dire despair  When injur'd  Lear  with tort'ring anguish wild  Pours the deep curse on each ungrateful child  When plaintiff notes speak poor  Ophelia  's woes  Or love in  Juliet  's tender bosom glows  The glistening eye the trembling lip proclaim  Nature and virtue here are still the same  In scepter'd state affliction's soothing strain  Still in YOUR bosoms fix their stedfast reign  Blest seat of empire Where th' affections wait  To shield the mourner from the shocks of fate  Where the best passions with allegiance fair  For suff'ring worth the healing balms prepare  Nor ever shall your hearts such rights forego  What  social sorrow asks these hearts shall still bestow  No longer then oppress'd with anxious fear  The muse shall REASUME her station  here    Shall court each virtue that's a nation's pride  And gain the nobler passions to her side  If in the tenour of her pensive lay  In nature's path TO NIGHT she holds her way  If she excites the sympathising mind  To generous acts the glory of our kind  This dread  To the Pit  tribunal shall suspend its zeal  Spurn its proud office and grow proud to feel  This radiant  To the Boxes  circle too her hopes approve  And grace the triumph of the  muse  they love  The following prologue from an honourgiving muse of which it is truly worthy did not arrive till after Mr Bannister was put in possession of the excellent poetry which precedes it and which another ingenious friend had been sollicited to supply The author of the tragedy however thinks Miss Seward's composition too valuable to circulate only in manuscript Indeed to keep such verses out of print would not only be a private injury to the piece which they will adorn but an unpardonable injustice to the public  PROLOGUE  BY MISS SEWARD  SLOW from an ebon throne's majestic height  A lovely form descends upon my sight  The floating purple and the lofty mien  Proclaim  the empress of the tragic scene  Divine MelpomeneAggriev'd she stands  Her tears fast falling on her folded hands  The show'ry cloud thus dims the azure skies  Thus round the moon the misty halos rise  Why beauteous mourner ere the hour of woe  Throb those quick sighs those crystal sorrows flow  Thy Fair Circassian yet no griefs molest  Nor love nor fear assail her virgin breast  But softthe muse of anguish sadly speaks  Faint on my ear the murm'ring accent breaks  Low hollow gales its mournful sounds convey  And thus the goddess saysor seems to say  "Can then the tender female bosom prove  "A keener pang than disappointed love  "Ah meFor light Thalia  more  than shares  "My darling Sheridan's too partial cares  "On her vain brows his lavish wreaths are thrown  "His thousand radiant gems emblaze her zone  "What tho' she gave to his supreme command  "Each laughing grace that waits her potent wand  "Yet with sublimer force  my  chemicfire  "'With proud distinction deck'd his sacred lyre'  Parody on a beautiful line in Mr Sheridan's monody  "To purest gold its warbling wires I turn'd  "When their sweet lays o'er lifeless Garrick mourn'd  "And once he sung in  See prologue to Semiramis  elevated strain  "My charms superior and my right to reign  "Then with the majesty my impulse throws  "In chasten'd splendor round the poet's brows  "He bade the tears that stream'd o'er Asia's queen  "Flow soft in  real  sorrow's lonely scene  "But soon he  smil'd  those graceful tears away  "And faithless own'd my frolic  rival  's sway  "Perchance howe'er the jocund pride of youth  "Alone has warp'd from me his love and truth  "Ere long the rover may again be mine  "And with his blooming laurels deck my shrine  "This night no vulgar hand the meed bestows  "That now for me in pristine beauty glows  "Oh may the fost'ring breath of public praise  "Preserve from cruel blight the votive bays"  I hear no moreFor with a pensive smile  Slow glides the muse down yonder winding isle  May you ye brave and wise ye good and fair  Fulfil with suffrage kind her fervent pray'r  And since no force of wit and comic art  Can shut to pity's plaint the British heart  We hope your just applause may bless our bard  His first ambition and his bright reward  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  ALMORAN  MR PALMER  HAMET  MR SMITH  OMAR  MR BENLLEY  ALI  MR PACKER  CALED  MR

That gorgeous palace reassumes its lustre  And these pavilions once more breathe around  The soul of eastern fragrance  CALED  Ali yes  Hither advance from Asia's vassal shores  Ambassadors high fraught with luscious burthens  Till Persia blooms in flattery Late they came  With solemn homage to condole and now  Heaping their lavish incense on our shrines  Congratulation wreathes the ready smile  The scene is fair my friend but soon again  Shall each proud blossom of the realm be wither'd  ALI  Thou think'st that Solyman hath ill bequeath'd  The crown between his sons  CALED  Hath ill bequeath'd  To bind the warring elements to fix  In closest league th' extremes of frost and fire  And every opposite in nature force  Into reluctant unionSuch my friend  Such is the will of Solyman  ALI  The king  Was scarce entomb'd ere brooding jealousies  Broke forthRemember'st thou the hour  When Omar with the lords of state around  The will first gave to Almoran Ye heavens  How proud the triumph while with subject zeal  Unconscious of his fortune Hamet bow'd  And oh what deep abasement follow'd swift  Upon the elder king as Omar drew  From the concealing robe another scroll  That nam'd young Hamet partner of the throne  CALED  Preposterous distribution thus to leave  A splendid source of endless discontent  ALI  And this in spite of Omar's bearded wisdom  CALED  Omar the sage to whom the seal of Solyman  In royal confidence was still reveal'd  Omar who trims the lonely lamp of wisdom  When half the lazy globe is wrapt in slumber  Omar the prince's guardian master oracle  The proud philosopher the seer profound  That  he  should thus dispose the dotard's sceptre  And get the start of men like thee my Ali  ALI  Ali's holy function still protects him  Fom ev'ry rebel

And in soft vision charms Almeida's bosom  CRISANTHE  And Hamet well deserves  ALMEIDA  Deserves Crisanthe  Not all the lavish luxury of praise  By Imans offer'd at the holy altars  Not the rich tides of eloquence that roll  Upon the poet's tongue by every muse  And every god inspir'd to grace the song  Can pay just tribute to the soul of Hamet  'Tis not my friend the busy breath of rumour  That pours the doubtful hint into the ear  The dazzling sceptre the effulgent robe  Nor yet the vollied burst of public fame  Which stamps true splendor on the hearts of kings  Array'd in ALL these trappings they may beat  Less fair less friendly to the rights of man  And fill a smaller space in nature's circle  Than the poor peasant toiling at the car  Monarch of many a private  useful  virtue  Without the power the dangerous power to prove  A tyranto'er the rest of human kind  CRISAN THE  But ev'n th' untutor'd clown delighted talks  Of Hamet's princely virtues  ALMEIDA  Oh he does  Each hind may see the royal soul expand  Like some etherial light supplying fire  That feeds unnumber'd stars with constant rays  But oh Crisanthe never can  he  see  The soft enchantments of the tender heart  Friendship's divine effusion love's pure flame  Each grace of life retiredThese shine alone  Like silent dews that shed their balms unheard  Like planets deep in heaven that bless unseen  The favour'd few that share the  sacred  hour  CRISANTHE  The sacred hour reserv'd for fair Almeida  But say my gentle friendfor still delay'd  The tale of wonderheard but yet in part  Did he not act like some superiour power  When he with vent'rous arm rush'd through the flames  To save thee from destruction  ALMEIDA  Like a god  My guardian god Hear then in full the story  Midnight had hung the silent air in black  Not one bright star display'd it's beamy brow  The wat'rybosom'd clouds were bent to earth  When swift the desolating light'ning's flash  Spread the farblazing ruin thro' the palace  Sudden it struck my venerable sire  In vain I press'd him in these filial arms  He fellIn that tremendous moment  Came my deliverer my king my Hamet  And rescu'd child and parent from the flames  CRISANTHE  Gracious Heaven  ALMEIDA  Soon as fled sense return'd  I saw the gentle generous kneeling king  Bent in soft sorrows o'er his wretched charge  And as the deep confusion ting'd my cheek  With tender force he strain'd me to his heart  While good Abdallah by his care protected  From all the hurry of the court reposes  And still unable as the veteran is  To view the sun or move from his pale couch  He cheery laughs thou know'st the hours away  Still Hamet or Almeida by his side  CRISANTHE  Behold the kingThe royal lover comes  ALMEIDA  Ah faithful fondnessleave us gentle friend  Yet stay CrisantheStay attest his kindness  SCENE III  HAMET ALMEIDA CRISANTHE  HAMET  Dear heavenly maidthou treasure of my soul  How poor is language to the feeling heart  Oh let me thus supply the want of words  Thus speak the transports of my wond'rous fondness  ALMEIDA  How shall Almeida mark her gratitude  Offering to kneel  HAMET  Almeida rise Oh do not thus o'erpay  The common duties of a common man  To help the wretched is the debt of nature  A debt which every honest mind shou'd pay  To all that wear the kindred forms of men  ALMEIDA  Oh HametOh my kingif rising blushes  If these reveal notthe obedient subject  HAMET  Obedient subject most unkind Almeida  Rob not the great prerogative of virtue  The generous bosom knows no vain superior  And pitied be the wretch or king or subject  Who at proud distance holds the heart he loves  ALMEIDA  Thou hast subdu'dI can conceal no more  My humble station bade me long restrain  Affection for a prince for Persia's king  But now  HAMET  Yes now receive  Now deign to share my love my life my throne  Oh witness heav'n the glowing exultation  Witness the triumphs of this throbbing heart  As thus it owns Almeida for a queen  And yet my brother  ALMEIDA  What of him my lord  HAMET  Oh I have doubts  ALMEIDA  Ha doubtshave doubts my lord  HAMET  How shall I speak Almeida to thy softness  How hope thy pardon for a tender fraud  By some dire chance my brother knows our story  And as in jest he tax'd me with concealment  Desir'd to view a sister in Almeida  ALMEIDA  Where was the fault in this or where the danger  HAMET  At this a sudden sickness seiz'd my heart  'Twas plain I lov'dhe pierc'd the thin disguise  Enjoy'd my pain and triumph'd in discovery  ALMEIDA  And what of that Your feelings are too nice  Too delicately fine to bear the shaft  Which laughter ever levels at the lover  Spirits less lively meet the mirth with smiles  And wit's pert jest falls pointless to the ground  HAMET  How little dost thou know the soul of Almoran  That even blazes at the view of beauty  How wou'd he catch soft fury from this hand  And drink large draughts of passion from those eyes  And then  ALMEIDA  What then my lord  Hast thou no credit in Almeida's faith  Ungenerous prince the heart that rules this bosom  Courts not the kingly crown nor splendid sceptre  Had'st thou been born the lowliest of the poor  Still had I sought alliance with thy virtues  Still had I scorn'd variety of lovers  HAMET  I know it all dear maid I know it all  Yet Almoran  ALMEIDA  Can Almoran forget  The ties of nature or the bonds of honour  The dear domestic duties of the brother  The awful virtues of the public station  The law which binds the monarch to the man  Or if he could and this illfated form  Should chance to touch him with a transient passion  What would avail the momentary liking  Soon would his power o'erlook an humble maid  And gladly leave her to the partial Hamet  Or at the worstshould he pursue Almeida  Firm in the pure resolves of virtuous love  Ev'n I the subject daughter of Abdallah  Bold in her virgin truth would own her fondness  Assert the native freedom of the heart  Clasp her lov'd lord and thus avow her passion  HAMET  Oh thou dear maidonce more receive my thanks  embracing  Receive a willing heart that doats to death  Forgive the delicate alarms of love  I have no doubtsmy sickly fears are past  I tread in aether and I breathe in heaven  I amoh all ye PowersI am most blest  ALMEIDA  My lord behold  Seeing Almoran and Caled at a distance  HAMET  'Tis Almoran with Caledhaste my love  And shield thy beauties from his dangerous gaze  In this pavilionSoon he will be gone  Ah quick retire and e'er tomorrow's dawn  I will prepareby heav'n they're hereaway  Hamet conducts Almeida into a pavilion  SCENE IV  ALMORAN CALED  CALED  Yonder my lord he steals  ALMORAN  But where the lady  CALED  Dread sire I see her not  ALMORAN  Didst thou not leave him with her  CALED  Hypocrisy assist

And earnest press it to his glowing bosom  While she  ALMORAN  Go on  CALED  Repuls'd his freedom  With a sweet resistanceand in soft coyness  Sported with refusal  ALMORAN  Spoke they of me  Or ought

disorder wales a newborn charm  As the bloom ripens on her rosy lips  ALMORAN  At every glance more lovely than before  Ne'er did each feature flame so full to view  Caled by heav'n her eye shot suns outblaz'd  That symbol of the God to which we bow  CALED  Well may the happy Hamet wish to screen  The fair recluse from each obtrusive eye  And hide her from an elder brother's gaze  Ah heav'n preserve the sultan of the world  My sovereign labours with some secret sorrow  Oh that the slave could aught administer  To his imperial master  ALMORAN  Ha imperial  Said'st thou Caled that I were

and attend  Thrice has the year renew'd the robes of spring  Since from the circling crouds that guard the palace  An undistinguish'd multitude of slaves  Thee I mark'd out for favour bade thee meet  The eye of Almoran without prostration  And rank'd thee next to Osmyn  CALED  Next to Osmyn  aside  ALMORAN  In thy settled look  Firm and unaw'd I saw the aspiring soul  That suited well the servant

night's representation happened on the opening of parliament  in order due  A gracious speech first made debates ensue  Ere then in this  full house  our author's fate  Becomes the subject of your warm debate  Ere yet you opposition criticks rise  To move for censures and refuse supplies  Or partial friends pour down corrupt applause  By  orders  pension'd in the author's cause  From either partynone will sure impeach  My sovereign title to pronounce the speech  Thro' me the muse her  loyal subjects  greets  Tho' I speak standing and you keep your seats  Pleas'd that so full a house attends the summons  PitBoxand GalleryPeers and faithful Commons  With deep concern she bids me here relate  What dangers threaten the dramatic state  What hosts of foes her tottering realms invade  By fashion muster'd and by folly paid  While  Taste  her old ally unmov'd we see  And  Spleen  preserves an  arm'd neutrality  See first come onall arm'd in whalebone hoops  The tuneful leaders of the Italian troops  Long have they wag'dtoo oft with conquest crown'd  The doubtful conflict betwixt sense and sound  Allied with thesein hostile bands advance  The lightheel'd legions of invading France  To point her thunders on our British coast  Year after year has been vain Gallia's boast  Their troops embarkthe bold attempt is plann'd  Their  heroes threaten  and their  dancers land    These only  put their threats in execution  And lay all London under contribution  Immortal chiefs who on one leg can do  What yet no warrior has atchiev'd on two  Like Rome's proud victor in their fierce attack  They come they see they conquer andgo back  And modern Jasons as of old in Greece  Sail home triumphant with the golden fleece  Before such dangers shall we prostate fall  Or like true Britons boldly brave them all  If fairly led we'll bid their host defiance  Dissolv'd a late  unnatural alliance  Our leader too shall now assistance lend  Not promise succours and delay to send  But chiefly  here  our hopes and courage lie  In  you  our truest friend and best ally  Support our Bard tonight and on his part  Receive the  tribute  of a grateful heart  Thro' me receive and here again I'll meet ye  Act as ambassadress and sign the treaty
