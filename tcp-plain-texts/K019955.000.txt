vain  THOMSON  HAIL generous CORSICA unconquer'd isle  The fort of freedom that amidst the waves  Stands like a rock of adamant and dares  The wildest fury of the beating storm  And are there yet in this late sickly age  Unkindly to the tow'ring growths of virtue  Such bold exalted spirits Men whose deeds  To the bright annals of old GREECE oppos'd  Would throw in shades her yet unrival'd name  And dim the lustre of her fairest page  And glows the flame of LIBERTY so strong  In this lone speck of earth this spot obscure  Shaggy with woods and crusted o'er with rock  By slaves surrounded and by slaves oppress'd  What then should BRITONS feel should they not catch  The warm contagion of heroic ardour  And kindle at a fire so like their own  Such were the working thoughts which swell'd the breast  Of generous BOSWEL when with nobler aim  And views beyond the narrow beaten track  By trivial fancy trod he turn'd his course  From polish'd Gallia's soft delicious vales  From the grey reliques of imperial Rome  From her long galleries of laurel'd stone  Her chisel'd heroes and her marble gods  Whose dumb majestic pomp yet awes the world  To animated forms of patriot zeal  Warm in the living majesty of virtue  Elate with fearless spirit firm resolv'd  By forune unsubdued unaw'd by power  How raptur'd fancy burns while warm in thought  I trace the pictur'd landscape while I kiss  With pilgrim lips devout the sacred soil  Stain'd with the blood of heroes CYRNUS hail  Hail to thy rocky deep indented shores  And pointed cliffs which hear the chafing deep  Incessant foaming round their shaggy sides  Hail to thy winding bays thy shelt'ring ports  And ample harbours which inviting stretch  Their hospitable arms to every sail  Thy numerous streams that bursting from the cliffs  Down the steep channel'd rock impetuous pour  With grateful murmur on the fearful edge  Of the rude precipice thy hamlets brown  And strawroof'd cots which from the level vale  Scarce seen amongst the craggy hanging cliffs  Seem like an eagle's nest aerial built  Thy swelling mountains brown with solemn shade  Of various trees that wave their giant arms  O'er the rough sons of freedom lofty pines  And hardy fir and ilex ever green  And spreading chesnut with each humbler plant  And shrub of fragrant leaf that clothes their sides  With living verdure whence the clust'ring bee  Extracts her golden dews the shining box  And sweetleav'd myrtle aromatic thyme  The prickly juniper and the green leaf  Which feeds the spinning worm while glowing bright  Beneath the various foliage wildly spreads  The arbutus and rears his scarlet fruit  Luxuriant mantling o'er the craggy steeps  And thy own native laurel crowns the scene  Hail to thy savage forests awful deep  Thy tangled thickets and thy crowded woods  The haunt of herds untam'd which sullen bound  From rock to rock with fierce unsocial air  And wilder gaze as conscious of the power  That loves to reign amid the lonely scenes  Of unbroke nature precipices huge  And tumbling torrents trackless desarts plains  Fenc'd in with guardian rocks whose quarries teem  With shining steel that to the cultur'd fields  And sunny hills which wave with bearded grain  Defends their homely produce LIBERTY  The mountain goddess loves to range at large  Amidst such scenes and on the iron soil  Prints her majestic step for these she scorns  The green enamel'd vales the velvet lap  Of smooth savannahs where the pillow'd head  Of luxury reposes balmy gales  And bowers that breathe of bliss for these when first  This isle emerging like a beauteous gem  From the dark bosom of the Tyrrhene main  Rear'd its fair front she mark'd it for her own  And with her spirit warm'd her genuine sons  A broken remnant from the generous stock  Of ancient Greece from Sparta's sad remains  True to their high descent preserv'd unquench'd  The sacred fire thro' many a barbarous age  Whom nor the iron rod of cruel Carthage  Nor the dread sceptre of imperial Rome  Nor bloody Goth nor grisly Saracen  Nor the long galling yoke of proud Liguria  Could crush into subjection Still unquell'd  They rose superior bursting from their chains  And claim'd man's dearest birthright LIBERTY  And long thro' many a hard unequal strife  Maintain'd the glorious conflict long withstood  With single arm the whole collected force  Of haughty Genoa and ambitious Gaul  And shall withstand it trust the faithful Muse  It is not in the force of mortal arm  Scarcely in fate to bind the struggling soul  That gall'd by wanton power indignant swells  Against oppression breathing great revenge  Careless of life determin'd to be free  And fav'ring heaven approves for see the Man  Born to exalt his own and give mankind  A glimpse of higher natures just as great  The soul of counsel and the nerve of war  Of high unshaken spirit temper'd sweet  With soft urbanity and polish'd grace  And attic wit and gay unstudied smiles  Whom heaven in some propitious hour endow'd  With every purer virtue gave him all  That lifts the hero or adorns the man  Gave him the eye sublime the searching glance  Keen scanning deep that smites the guilty soul  As with a beam from heaven on his brow  Serene and spacious front set the broad seal  Of dignity and rule then smil'd benign  On this fair pattern of a God below  High wrought and breath'd into his swelling breast  The large ambitious wish to save his country  Oh beauteous title to immortal fame  The man devoted to the public stands  In the bright records of superior worth  A step below the skies if he succeed  The first fair lot which earth affords is his  And if he falls he falls above a throne  When such their leader can the brave despair  Freedom the cause and PAOLI the chief  Success to your fair hopes a British muse  Tho' weak and powerless lifts her fervent voice  And breathes a prayer for your success Oh could  She scatter blessings as the morn sheds dews  To drop upon your heads but patient hope  Must wait the appointed hour secure of this  That never with the indolent and weak  Will freedom deign to dwell she must be seiz'd  By that bold arm that wrestles for the blessing  'Tis heaven's best gift and must be bought with blood  When the storm thickens when the combat burns  And pain and death in every horrid shape  That can appall the feeble prowl around  Then virtue triumphs then her tow'ring form  Dilates with kindling majesty her mien  Breathes a diviner spirit and enlarg'd  Each spreading feature with an ampler port  And bolder tone exulting rides the storm  And joys amidst the tempest then she reaps  Her golden harvest fruits of nobler growth  And higher relish than meridian suns  Can ever ripen fair heroic deeds  And godlike action 'Tis not meats and drinks  And balmy airs and vernal suns and showers  That feed and ripen minds 'tis toil and danger  And wrestling with the stubborn gripe of fate  And war and sharp distress and paths obscure  And dubious The bold swimmer joys not so  To feel the proud waves under him and beat  With strong repelling arm the billowy surge  The generous courser does not so exult  To toss his floating mane against the wind  And neigh amidst the thunder of the war  As virtue to oppose her swelling breast  Like a firm shield against the darts of fate  And when her sons in that rough school have learn'd  To smile at danger then the hand that rais'd  Shall hush the storm and lead the shining train  Of peaceful years in bright procession on  Then shall the shepherd's pipe the muse's lyre  On CYRNUS' shores be heard her grateful sons  With loud acclaim and hymns of cordial praise  Shall hail their high deliverers every name  To virtue dear be from oblivion snatch'd  And plac'd among the stars but chiefly thine  Thine PAOLI with sweetest sound shall dwell  On their applauding lips thy sacred name  Endear'd to long posterity some muse  More worthy of the theme shall consecrate  To after ages and applauding worlds  Shall bless the godlike man who sav'd his country  So vainly wish'd so fondly hop'd the Muse  Too fondly hop'd The iron fates prevail  And CYRNUS is no more Her generous sons  Less vanquish'd than o'erwhelm'd by numbers crush'd  Admir'd unaided fell So strives the moon  In dubious battle with the gathering clouds  And strikes a splendour thro' them till at length  Storms roll'd on storms involve the face of heaven  And quench her struggling fires Forgive the zeal  That too presumptuous whisper'd better things  And read the book of destiny amiss  Not with the purple colouring of success  Is virtue best adorn'd th' attempt is praise  There yet remains a freedom nobler far  Than kings or senates can destroy or give  Beyond the proud oppressor's cruel grasp  Seated secure uninjur'd undestroy'd  Worthy of Gods The freedom of the mind  The INVITATION To MISS B    Hic gelidi fontes hic mollia prata Lycori  Hic nemus hic ipso tecum consumerer aevo  VIRGIL  HEALTH to my friend and long unbroken years  By storms unruffled and unstain'd by tears  Wing'd by new joys may each white minute fly  Spring on her cheek and sunshine in her eye  O'er that dear breast where love and pity springs  May peace eternal spread her downy wings  Sweet beaming hope her path illumine still  And fair ideas all her fancy fill  From glittering scenes which strike the dazzled sight  With mimic grandeur and illusive light  From idle hurry and tumultous noise  From hollow friendships and from sickly joys  Will DELIA at the muse's call retire  To the pure pleasures rural scenes inspire  Will she from crowds and busy cities fly  Where wreaths of curling smoke involve the sky  To taste the grateful shade of spreading trees  And drink the spirit of the mountain breeze  When winter's hand the rough'ning year deforms  And hollow winds foretel approaching storms  Then Pleasure like a bird of passage flies  To brighter climes and more indulgent skies  Cities and courts allure her sprightly train  From the bleak mountain and the naked plain  And gold and gems with artificial blaze  Supply the sickly sun's declining rays  But soon returning on the western gale  She seeks the bosom of the grassy vale  There wrapt in careless ease attunes the lyre  To the wild warblings of the woodland quire  The daisied turf her humble throne supplies  And early primroses around her rise  We'll follow where the smiling goddess leads  Thro' tangled forests or enamel'd meads  O'er pathless hills her airy form we'll chase  In silent glades her fairy footsteps trace  Small pains there needs her footsteps to pursue  She cannot fly from friendship and from you  Now the glad earth her frozen zone unbinds  And o'er her bosom breathe the western winds  Already now the snowdrop dares appear  The first pale blossom of th' unripen'd year  As FLORA's breath by some transforming power  Had chang'd an icicle into a flower  Its name and hue the scentless plant retains  And winter lingers in its icy veins  To these succeed the violet's dusky blue  And each inferior flower of fainter hue  Till riper months the perfect year disclose  And FLORA cries exulting See my Rose  The Muse invites my DELIA haste away  And let us sweetly waste the careless day  Here gentle summits lift their airy brow  Down the green slope here winds the labouring plow  Here bath'd by frequent show'rs cool vales are seen  Cloath'd with fresh verdure and eternal green  Here smooth canals across th' extended plain  Stretch their long arms to join the distant main  The sons of toil with many a weary stroke  Scoop the hard bosom of the solid rock  Resistless thro' the stiff opposing clay  With steady patience work their gradual way  Compel the genius of th' unwilling flood  Thro' the brown horrors of the aged wood  Cross the lone waste the silver urn they pour  And chear the barren heath or sullen moor  The traveller with pleasing wonder sees  The white sail gleaming thro' the dusky trees  And views the alter'd landscape with surprise  And doubts the magic scenes which round him rise  Now like a flock of swans above his head  Their woven wings the flying vessels spread  Now meeting streams in artful mazes glide  While each unmingled pours a separate tide  Now through the hidden veins of earth they flow  And visit sulphurous mines and caves below  The ductile streams obey the guiding hand  And social plenty circles round the land  But nobler praise awaits our green retreats  The Muses here have fixt their sacred seats  Mark where its simple front yon mansion rears  The nursery of men for future years  Here callow chiefs and embryo statesmen lie  And unfledg'd poets short excursions try  While Mersey's gentle current which too long  By fame neglected and unknown to song  Between his rushy banks no poet's theme  Had crept inglorious like a vulgar stream  Reflects th' ascending seats with conscious pride  And dares to emulate a classic tide  Soft music breathes along each op'ning shade  And sooths the dashing of his rough cascade  With mystic lines his sands are figur'd o'er  And circles trac'd upon the letter'd shore  Beneath his willows rove th' inquiring youth  And court the fair majestic form of truth  Here nature opens all her secret springs  And heav'nborn science plumes her eagle wings  Too long had bigot rage with malice swell'd  Crush'd her strong pinions and her flight witheld  Too long to check her ardent progress strove  So writhes the serpent round the bird of Jove  Hangs on her flight restrains her tow'ring wing  Twists its dark folds and points its venom'd sting  Yet still if aught aright the Muse divine  Her rising pride shall mock the vain design  On sounding pinions yet aloft shall soar  And thro' the azure deep untravel'd paths explore  Where science smiles the Muses join the train  And gentlest arts and purest manners reign  Ye generous youth who love this studious shade  How rich a field is to your hopes display'd  Knowledge to you unlocks the classic page  And virtue blossoms for a better age  Oh golden days oh bright unvalued hours  What bliss did ye but know that bliss were yours  With richest stores your glowing bosoms fraught  Perception quick and luxury of thought  The high designs that heave the labouring soul  Panting for fame impatient of controul  And fond enthusiastic thought that feeds  On pictur'd tales of vast heroic deeds  And quick affections kindling into flame  At virtue's or their country's honour'd name  And spirits light to every joy in tune  And friendship ardent as a summer's noon  And generous scorn of vice's venal tribe  And proud disdain of interest's sordid bribe  And conscious honour's quick instinctive fense  And smiles unforc'd and easy confidence  And vivid fancy and clear simple truth  And all the mental bloom of vernal youth  How bright the scene to fancy's eye appears  Thro' the long perspective of distant years  When this this little group their country calls  From academic shades and learned halls  To fix her laws her spirit to sustain  And light up glory thro' her wide domain  Their various tastes in different arts display'd  Like temper'd harmony of light and shade  With friendly union in one mass shall blend  And this adorn the state and that defend  These the sequester'd shade shall cheaply please  With learned labour and inglorious ease  While those impell'd by some resistless force  O'er seas and rocks shall urge their vent'rous course  Rich fruits matur'd by glowing suns behold  And China's groves of vegetable gold  From every land the various harvest spoil  And bear the tribute to their native soil  But tell each land while every toil they share  Firm to sustain and resolute to dare  MAN is the nobler growth our realms supply  And SOULS are ripen'd in our northern sky  Some pensive creep along the shelly shore  Unfold the silky texture of a flower  With sharpen'd eyes inspect an hornet's sting  And all the wonders of an insect's wing  Some trace with curious search the hidden cause  Of nature's changes and her various laws  Untwist her beauteous web disrobe her charms  And hunt her to her elemental forms  Or prove what hidden powers in herbs are found  To quench disease and staunch the burning wound  With cordial drops the fainting head sustain  Call back the flitting soul and still the throbs of pain  The patriot passion this shall strongly feel  Ardent and glowing with undaunted zeal  With lips of fire shall plead his country's cause  And vindicate the majesty of laws  This cloath'd with Britain's thunder spread alarms  Thro' the wide earth and shake the pole with arms  That to the sounding lyre his deeds rehearse  Enshrine his name in some immortal verse  To long posterity his praise consign  And pay a life of hardships by a line  While others consecrate to higher aims  Whose hallow'd bosoms glow with purer flames  Love in their heart persuasion in their tongue  With words of peace shall charm the list'ning throng  Draw the dread veil that wraps th' eternal throne  And launch our souls into the bright unknown  Here cease my song Such arduous themes require  A master's pencil and a poet's fire  Unequal far such bright designs to paint  Too weak her colours and her lines too faint  My drooping Muse folds up her fluttering wing  And hides her head in the green lap of spring  The GROANS of the TANKARD  Dulci digne mero  HORAT  OF strange events I sing and portents dire  The wond'rous theme a reverend ear require  Tho' strange the tale the faithful Muse believe  And what she says with pious awe receive  'Twas at the solemn silent noontide hour  When hunger rages with despotic power  When the lean student quits his Hebrew roots  For the gross nourishment of English fruits  And throws unfinish'd airy systems by  For solid pudding and substantial pye  When hungry poets the glad summons own  And leave spare fast to dine with Gods alone  Our sober meal dispatch'd with silent haste  The decent grace concludes the short repast  Then urg'd by thirst we cast impatient eyes  Where deep capacious vast of ample size  The tankard stood replenish'd to the brink  With the cool beverage blueey'd Naiads drink  But lo a sudden prodigy appears  And our chill'd hearts recoil with startling fears  Its yawning mouth disclos'd the deep profound  And in low murmurs breath'd a sullen sound  Cold drops of dew did on the sides appear  No finger touch'd it and no hand was near  At length th' indignant vase its silence broke  First heav'd deep hollow groans and then distinctly spoke  "How chang'd the scene for what unpardon'd crimes  "Have I surviv'd to these degenerate times  "I who was wont the festal board to grace  "And midst the circle lift my honest face  "White o'er with froth like Etna crown'd with snow  "Which mantled o'er the brown abyss below  "Where Ceres mingled with her golden store  "The richer spoils of either India's shore  "The dulcet reed the Western islands boast  "And spicy fruit from Banda's fragrant coast  "At solemn feasts the nectar'd draught I pour'd  "And often journey'd round the ample board  "The portly Alderman the stately Mayor  "And all the furry tribe my worth declare  "And the keen Sportsman oft his labours done  "To me retreating with the setting sun  "Deep draughts imbib'd and conquer'd land and sea  "And overthrew the pride of France by me  "Let meaner clay contain the limpid wave  "The clay for such an office nature gave  "Let China's earth enrich'd with colour'd stains  "Pencil'd with gold and streak'd with azure veins  "The grateful flavour of the Indian leaf  "Or Mocho's sunburnt berry glad receive  "The nobler metal claims more generous use  "And mine should flow with more exalted juice  "Did I for this my native bed resign  "From the dark bowels of Potosi's mine  "Was I for this with violence torn away  "And drag'd to regions of the upper day  "For this the rage of torturing furnace bore  "From foreign dross to purge the bright'ning ore  "For this have I endur'd the fiery test  "And was I stamp'd for this with Britain's lofty crest  "Unblest the day and luckless was the hour  "Which doom'd me to a Presbyterian's power  "Fated to serve the Puritanick race  "Whose slender meal is shorter than their grace  "Whose moping sons no jovial orgies keep  "Where evening brings no summons but to sleep  "No Carnival is even Christmas here  "And one long Lent involves the meagre year  "Bear me ye pow'rs to some more genial scene  "Where on soft cushions lolls the gouty Dean  "Or rosy Prebend with cherubic face  "With double chin and paunch of portly grace  "Who lull'd in downy slumbers shall agree  "To own no inspiration but from me  "Or to some spacious mansion Gothic old  "Where Comus sprightly train their vigils hold  "There oft exhausted and replenish'd oft  "Oh let me still supply th' eternal draught  "Till care within the deep abyss be drown'd  "And thought grows giddy at the vast profound"  More had the goblet spoke but lo appears  An ancient Sybil furrow'd o'er with years  Her aspect sour and stern ungracious look  With sudden damp the conscious vessel struck  Chill'd at her touch its mouth it slowly clos'd  And in long silence all its griefs repos'd  Yet still low murmurs creep along the ground  And the air vibrates with the silver sound  ON THE Backwardness of the SPRING  Estatem increpitans seram zephyrosque morantes  VIRGIL  IN vain the sprightly sun renews his course  Climbs up th' ascending signs and leads the day  While long embattled clouds repel his force  And lazy vapours choak the golden ray  In vain the spring proclaims the newborn year  No flowers beneath her lingering footsteps spring  No rosy garland binds her flowing hair  And in her train no feather'd warblers sing  Her opening breast is stain'd with frequent showers  Her streaming tresses bath'd in chilling dews  And sad before her move the pensive hours  Whose flagging wings no breathing sweets diffuse  Like some lone pilgrim clad in mournful weed  Whose wounded bosom drinks her falling tears  On whose pale cheek relentless sorrows feed  Whose dreary way no sprightly carol chears  Not thus she breath'd on Arno's purple shore  And call'd the Tuscan Muses to her bowers  Not this the robe in Enna's vale she wore  When Ceres daughter fill'd her lap with flowers  Clouds behind clouds in long succession rise  And heavy snows oppress the springing green  The dazzling waste fatigues the aching eyes  And fancy droops beneath th' unvaried scene  Indulgent nature loose this frozen zone  Thro' opening skies let genial sunbeams play  Dissolving snows shall their glad impulse own  And melt upon the bosom of the May  VERSES written in an Alcove  Jam Cytherea choros ducit Venus imminente Luna  HORAT  NOW the moonbeam's trembling lustre  Silvers o'er the dewy green  And in soft and shadowy colours  Sweetly paints the checquer'd scene  Here between the opening branches  Streams a flood of soften'd light  There the thick and twisted foliage  Spreads the browner gloom of night  This is sure the haunt of fairies  In yon cool Alcove they play  Care can never cross the threshold  Care was only made for day  Far from hence be noisy clamour  Sick disgust and anxious fear  Pining grief and wasting anguish  Never keep their vigils here  Tell no tales of sheeted spectres  Rising from the quiet tomb  Fairer forms this cell shall visit  Brighter visions gild the gloom  Choral songs and sprightly voices  Echo from her cell shall call  Sweeter sweeter than the murmur  Of the distant water fall  Every ruder gust of passion  Lull'd with music dies away  Till within the charmed bosom  None but soft affections play  Soft as when the evening breezes  Gently stir the poplar grove  Brighter than the smile of summer  Sweeter than the breath of love  Thee th' inchanted Muse shall follow  LISSY to the rustic cell  And each careless note repeating  Tune them to her charming shell  Not the Muse who wreath'd with laurel  Solemn stalks with tragic gait  And in clear and lofty vision  Sees the future births of fate  Not the maid who crown'd with cypress  Sweeps along in scepter'd pall  And in sad and solemn accents  Mourns the crested heroe's fall  But that other smiling sister  With the blue and laughing eye  Singing in a lighter measure  Strains of woodland harmony  All unknown to fame or glory  Easy blith and debonair  Crown'd with flowers her careless tresses  Loosely floating on the air  Then when next the star of evening  Softly sheds the silent dew  Let me in this rustic temple  LISSY meet the Muse and you  The MOUSE's PETITION  To Doctor PRIESTLEY  Found in the TRAP where he had been confin'd all Night  Parcere subjectis debellare superbos  VIRGIL  OH hear a pensive captive's prayer  For liberty that sighs  And never let thine heart be shut  Against the prisoner's cries  For here forlorn and sad I sit  Within the wiry grate  And tremble at th' approaching morn  Which brings impending fate  If e'er thy breast with freedom glow'd  And spurn'd a tyrant's chain  Let not thy strong oppressive force  A freeborn mouse detain  Oh do not stain with guiltless blood  Thy hospitable hearth  Nor triumph that thy wiles betray'd  A prize so little worth  The scatter'd gleanings of a feast  My scanty meals supply  But if thine unrelenting heart  That slender boon deny  The chearful light the vital air  Are blessings widely given  Let nature's commoners enjoy  The common gifts of heaven  The well taught philosophic mind  To all compassion gives  Casts round the world an equal eye  And feels for all that lives  If mind as ancient sages taught  A never dying flame  Still shifts thro' matter's varying forms  In every form the same  Beware lest in the worm you crush  A brother's soul you find  And tremble lest thy luckless hand  Dislodge a kindred mind  Or if this transient gleam of day  Be  all  of life we share  Let pity plead within thy breast  That little  all  to spare  So may thy hospitable board  With health and peace be crown'd  And every charm of heartfelt ease  Beneath thy roof be found  So when unseen destruction lurks  Which men like mice may share  May some kind angel clear thy path  And break the hidden snare  To MRS P  With some Drawings of BIRDS and INSECTS  The kindred arts to please thee shall conspire  One dip the pencil and one string the lyre  POPE  AMANDA bids at her command again  I seize the pencil or resume the pen  No other call my willing hand requires  And friendship better than a Muse inspires  Painting and poetry are near allied  The kindred arts two sister Muses guide  This charms the eye that steals upon the ear  There sounds are tun'd and colours blended here  This with a silent touch enchants our eyes  And bids a gayer brighter world arise  That less allied to sense with deeper art  Can pierce the close recesses of the heart  By well set syllables and potent sound  Can rouse can chill the breast can sooth can wound  To life adds motion and to beauty soul  And breathes a spirit through the finish'd whole  Each perfects each in friendly union join'd  This gives Amanda's form and that her mind  But humbler themes my artless hand requires  Nor higher than the feather'd tribe aspires  Yet who the various nations can declare  That plow with busy wing the peopled air  These cleave the crumbling bark for insect food  Those dip their crooked beak in kindred blood  Some haunt the rushy moor the lonely woods  Some bathe their silver plumage in the floods  Some fly to man his houshold gods implore  And gather round his hospitable door  Wait the known call and find protection there  From all the lesser tyrants of the air  The tawny EAGLE seats his callow brood  High on the cliff and feasts his young with blood  On Snowden's rocks or Orkney's wide domain  Whose beetling cliffs o'erhang the western main  The royal bird his lonely kingdom forms  Amidst the gathering clouds and sullen storms  Thro' the wide waste of air he darts his sight  And holds his sounding pinions pois'd for flight  With cruel eye premeditates the war  And marks his destin'd victim from afar  Descending in a whirlwind to the ground  His pinions like the rush of waters sound  The fairest of the fold he bears away  And to his nest compels the struggling prey  He scorns the game by meaner hunters tore  And dips his talons in no vulgar gore  With lovelier pomp along the grassy plain  The silver PHEASANT draws his shining train  On India's painted shore by Ganges' stream  He spreads his plumage to the sunny gleam  But when the wiry net his flight confines  He lowers his purple crest and inly pines  The beauteous captive hangs his ruffled wing  Oppress'd by bondage and our chilly spring  To claim the verse unnumber'd tribes appear  That swell the music of the vernal year  Seiz'd with the spirit of the kindly spring  They tune the voice and sleek the glossy wing  With emulative strife the notes prolong  And pour out all their little souls in song  When winter bites upon the naked plain  Nor food nor shelter in the groves remain  By instinct led a firm united band  As marshall'd by some skilful general's hand  The congregated nations wing their way  In dusky columns o'er the trackless sea  In clouds unnumber'd annual hover o'er  The craggy Bass or Kilda's utmost shore  Thence spread their sails to meet the southern wind  And leave the gathering tempest far behind  Pursue the circling sun's indulgent ray  Course the swift seasons and o'ertake the day  Not so the Insect race ordain'd to keep  The lazy sabbath of a halfyear's sleep  Entomb'd beneath the filmy web they lie  And wait the influence of a kinder sky  When vernal sunbeams pierce their dark retreat  The heaving tomb distends with vital heat  The fullform'd brood impatient of their cell  Start from their trance and burst their silken shell  Trembling awhile they stand and scarcely dare  To launch at once upon the untried air  At length assur'd they catch the favouring gale  And leave their sordid spoils and high in Ether sail  So when Rinaldo struck the conscious rind  He found a nymph in every trunk confin'd  The forest labours with convulsive throes  The bursting trees the lovely births disclose  And a gay troop of damsels round him stood  Where late was rugged bark and lifeless wood  Lo the bright train their radiant wings unfold  With silver fring'd and freckl'd o'er with gold  On the gay bosom of some fragrant flower  They idly fluttering live their little hour  Their life all pleasure and their task all play  All spring their age and sunshine all their day  Not so the child of sorrow wretched man  His course with toil concludes with pain began  Pleasure's the portion of th' inferior kind  But glory virtue Heaven for Man design'd  What atom forms of insect life appear  And who can follow nature's pencil here  Their wings with azure green and purple gloss'd  Studded with colour'd eyes with gems emboss'd  Inlaid with pearl and mark'd with various stains  Of lively crimson thro' their dusky veins  Some shoot like living stars athwart the night  And scatter from their wings a vivid light  To guide the Indian to his tawny loves  As thro' the woods with cautious step he moves  See the proud giant of the beetle race  What shining arms his polish'd limbs enchase  Like some stern warrior formidably bright  His steely sides reflect a gleaming light  On his large forehead spreading horns he wears  And high in air the branching antlers bears  O'er many an inch extends his wide domain  And his rich treasury swells with hoarded grain  Thy friend thus strives to cheat the lonely hour  With song or paint an insect or a flower  Yet if Amanda praise the flowing line  And bend delighted o'er the gay design  I envy not nor emulate the fame  Or of the painter's or the poet's name  Could I to both with equal claim pretend  Yet far far dearer were the name of FRIEND  CHARACTERS  semper amabilem  HORAT  OH born to sooth distress and lighten care  Lively as soft and innocent as fair  Blest with that sweet simplicity of thought  So rarely found and never to be taught  Of winning speech endearing artless kind  The loveliest pattern of a female mind  Like some fair spirit from the realms of rest  With all her native heaven within her breast  So pure so good she scarce can guess at sin  But thinks the world without like that within  Such melting tenderness so fond to bless  Her charity almost becomes excess  Wealth may be courted wisdom be rever'd  And beauty prais'd and brutal strength be fear'd  But goodness only can affection move  And love must owe its origin to love  Illam quicquid agit quoquo vestigia flectit  Componit furtim subsequiturque decor

grace  And chaste subdued delight  No more by varying passions beat  O gently guide my pilgrim feet  To find thy hermit cell  Where in some pure and equal sky  Beneath thy soft indulgent eye  The

what soft propitious hour  I best may chuse to hail thy power  And court thy gentle sway  When Autumn friendly to the Muse  Shall thy own modest tints diffuse  And shed thy milder day  When Eve her

Cupid wanton boy was young  His wings unfledg'd and rude his tongue  He loiter'd in Arcadian bowers  And hid his bow in wreaths of flowers  Or pierc'd some fond unguarded heart  With now and then a random dart  But heroes scorn'd the idle boy  And love was but a shepherd's toy  When Venus vex'd to see her child  Amidst the forests thus run wild  Would point him out some nobler game  Gods and godlike men to tame  She seiz'd the boy's reluctant hand  And led him to the virgin band  Where the sister muses round  Swell the deep majestic sound  And in solemn strains unite  Breathing chaste severe delight  Songs of chiefs and heroes old  In unsubmitting virtue bold  Of even valour's temperate heat  And toils to stubborn patience sweet  Of nodding plumes and burnish'd arms  And glory's bright terrific charms  The potent sounds like light'ning dart  Resistless thro' the glowing heart  Of power to lift the fixed soul  High o'er fortune's proud controul  Kindling deep prophetic musing  Love of beauteous death infusing  Scorn and unconquerable hate  Of tyrant pride's unhallow'd state  The boy abash'd and half afraid  Beheld each chaste immortal maid  Pallas spread her Egis there  Mars stood by with threat'ning air  And stern Diana's icy look  With sudden chill his bosom struck  Daughters of Jove receive the child  The queen of beauty said and smil'd  Her rosy breath perfum'd the air  And scatter'd sweet contagion there  Relenting nature learnt to languish  And sicken'd with delightful anguish  Receive him artless yet and young  Refine his air and smooth his tongue  Conduct him thro' your fav'rite bowers  Enrich'd with fair perennial flowers  To solemn shades and springs that lie  Remote from each unhallow'd eye  Teach him to spell those mystic names  That kindle bright immortal flames  And guide his young unpractis'd feet  To reach coy learning's lofty seat  Ah luckless hour mistaken maids  When Cupid sought the Muses shades  Of their sweetest notes beguil'd  By the sly insidious child  Now of power his darts are found  Twice ten thousand times to wound  Now no more the slacken'd strings  Breathe of high immortal things  But Cupid tunes the Muses lyre  To languid notes of soft desire  In every clime in every tongue  'Tis love inspires the poet's song  Hence Sappho's soft infectious page  Monimia's woe Othello's rage  Abandon'd Dido's fruitless prayer  And Eloisa's long despair  The garland bless'd with many a vow  For haughty Sacharissa's brow  And wash'd with tears the mournful verse  That Petrarch laid on Laura's herse  But more than all the sister quire  Music confess'd the pleasing fire  Here sovereign Cupid reign'd alone  Music and song were all his own  Sweet as in old Arcadian plains  The British pipe has caught the strains  And where the Tweed's pure current glides  Or Liffy rolls her limpid tides  Or Thames his oozy waters leads  Thro' rural bowers or yellow meads  With many an old romantic tale  Has cheer'd the lone sequester'd vale  With many a sweet and tender lay  Deceiv'd the tiresome summerday  'Tis yours to cull with happy art  Each meaning verse that speaks the heart  And fair array'd in order meet  To lay the wreath at beauty's feet  SONGS  I  COME here fond youth whoe'er thou be  That boasts to love as well as me  And if thy breast have felt so wide a wound  Come hither and thy flame approve  I'll teach thee what it is to love  And by what marks true passion may be found  It is to be all bath'd in tears  To live upon a smile for years  To lie whole ages at a beauty's feet  To kneel to languish and implore  And still tho' she disdain adore  It is to do all this and think thy sufferings sweet  It is to gaze upon her eyes  With eager joy and fond surprise  Yet temper'd with such chaste and awful fear  As wretches feel who wait their doom  Nor must one ruder thought presume  Tho' but in whispers breath'd to meet her ear  It is to hope tho' hope were lost  Tho' heaven and earth thy passion crost  Tho' she were bright as sainted queens above  And thou the least and meanest swain  That folds his flock upon the plain  Yet if thou dar'st not hope thou dost not love  It is to quench thy joy in tears  To nurse strange doubts and groundless fears  If pangs of jealousy thou hast not prov'd  Tho' she were fonder and more true  Than any nymph old poets drew  Oh never dream again that thou hast lov'd  If when the darling maid is gone  Thou dost not seek to be alone  Wrapt in a pleasing trance of tender woe  And muse and fold thy languid arms  Feeding thy fancy on her charms  Thou dost not love for love is nourish'd so  If any hopes thy bosom share  But those which love has planted there  Or any cares but his thy breast enthrall  Thou never yet his power hast known  Love sits on a despotic throne  And reigns a tyrant if he reigns at all  Now if thou art so lost a thing  Here all thy tender sorrows bring  And prove whose patience longest can endure  We'll strive whose fancy shall be lost  In dreams of fondest passion most  For if thou thus hast lov'd oh never hope a cure  SONG II  IF ever thou didst joy to bind  Two hearts in equal passion join'd  O son of VENUS hear me now  And bid FLORELLA bless my vow  If any bliss reserv'd for me  Thou in the leaves of fate should'st see  If any white propitious hour  Pregnant with hoarded joys in store  Now now the mighty treasure give  In her for whom alone I live  In sterling love pay all the sum  And I'll absolve the fates to come  In all the pride of fullblown charms  Yield her relenting to my arms  Her bosom touch with soft desires  And let her feel what she inspires  But CUPID if thine aid be vain  The dear reluctant maid to gain  If still with cold averted eyes  She dash my hopes and scorn my sighs  O grant 'tis all I ask of thee  That I no more may change than she  But still with duteous zeal love on  When every gleam of hope is gone  Leave me then alone to languish  Think not time can heal my anguish  Pity the woes which I endure  But never never grant a cure  SONG III  SYLVIA  LEAVE me simple shepherd leave me  Drag no more a hopeless chain  I cannot like nor would deceive thee  Love the maid that loves again  CORIN  Tho' more gentle nymphs surround me  Kindly pitying what I feel  Only you have power to wound me  SYLVIA only you can heal  SYLVIA  CORIN cease this idle teazing  Love that's forc'd is harsh and sour  If the lover be displeasing  To persist disgusts the more  CORIN  'Tis in vain in vain to fly me  SYLVIA I will still pursue  Twenty thousand times deny me  I will kneel and weep anew  SYLVIA  CUPID ne'er shall make me languish  I was born averse to love  Lovers' sighs and tears and anguish  Mirth and pastime to me prove  CORIN  Still I vow with patient duty  Thus to meet your proudest scorn  You for unrelenting beauty  I for constant love was born  But the fates had not consented  Since they both did fickle prove  Of her scorn the maid repented  And the shepherd of his love  SONG IV  WHEN gentle CELIA first I knew  A breast so good so kind so true  Reason and taste approv'd  Pleas'd to indulge so pure a flame  I call'd it by too soft a name  And fondly thought I lov'd  Till CHLORIS came with sad surprise  I felt the light'ning of her eyes  Thro' all my senses run  All glowing with resistless charms  She fill'd my breast with new alarms  I saw and was undone  O CELIA dear unhappy maid  Forbear the weakness to upbraid  Which ought your scorn to move  I know this beauty false and vain  I know she triumphs in my pain  Yet still I feel I love  Thy gentle smiles no more can please  Nor can thy softest friendship ease  The torments I endure  Think what that wounded breast must feel  Which truth and kindness cannot heal  Nor even thy pity cure  Oft shall I curse my iron chain  And wish again thy milder reign  With long and vain regret  All that I can to thee I give  And could I still to reason live  I were thy captive yet  But passion's wild impetuous sea  Hurries me far from peace and thee  'Twere vain to struggle more  Thus the poor sailor slumbering lies  While swelling tides around him rise  And push his bark from shore  In vain he spreads his helpless arms  His pitying friends with fond alarms  In vain deplore his state  Still far and farther from the coast  On the high surge his bark is tost  And foundering yields to fate  SONG V  AS near a weeping spring reclin'd  The beauteous ARAMINTA pin'd  And mourn'd a false ungrateful youth  While dying echoes caught the sound  And spread the soft complaints around  Of broken vows and alter'd truth  An aged shepherd heard her moan  And thus in pity's kindest tone  Address'd the lost despairing maid  Cease cease unhappy fair to grieve  For sounds tho' sweet can ne'er relieve  A breaking heart by love betray'd  Why shouldst thou waste such precious showers  That fall like dew on wither'd flowers  But dying passion ne'er restor'd  In beauty's empire is no mean  And woman either slave or queen  Is quickly scorn'd when not ador'd  Those liquid pearls from either eye  Which might an eastern empire buy  Unvalued here and fruitless fall  No art the season can renew  When love was young and DAMON true  No tears a wandering heart recall  Cease cease to grieve thy tears are vain  Should those fair orbs in drops of rain  Vie with a weeping southern sky  For hearts o'ercome with love and grief  All nature yields but one relief  Die hapless ARAMINTA die  SONG VI  WHEN first upon your tender cheek  I saw the morn of beauty break  With mild and chearing beam  I bow'd before your infant shrine  The earliest sighs you had were mine  And you my darling theme  I saw you in that opening morn  For beauty's boundless empire born  And first confess'd your sway  And e'er your thoughts devoid of art  Could learn the value of a heart  I gave my heart away  I watch'd the dawn of every grace  And gaz'd upon that angel face  While yet 'twas safe to gaze  And fondly blest each rising charm  Nor thought such innocence could harm  The peace of future days  But now despotic o'er the plains  The awful noon of beauty reigns  And kneeling crowds adore  These charms arise too fiercely bright  Danger and death attend the sight  And I must hope no more  Thus to the rising God of day  Their early vows the Persians pay  And bless the spreading fire  Whose glowing chariot mounting soon  Pours on their heads the burning noon  They sicken and expire  DELIA AN ELEGY  tecum ut longae sociarem gaudia vitae  Inque tuo caderet nostra senecta sinu  TIBUL  YES DELIA loves My fondest vows are blest  Farewel the memory of her past disdain  One kind relenting glance has heal'd my breast  And balanc'd in a moment years of pain  O'er her soft cheek consenting blushes move  And with kind stealth her secret soul betray  Blushes which usher in the morn of love  Sure as the red'ning east foretels the day  Her tender smiles shall pay me with delight  For many a bitter pang of jealous fear  For many an anxious day and sleepless night  For many a stifled sigh and silent tear  DELIA shall come and bless my lone retreat  She does not scorn the shepherd's lowly life  She will not blush to leave the splendid seat  And own the title of a poor man's wife  The simple knot shall bind her gather'd hair  The russet garment clasp her lovely breast  DELIA shall mix amongst the rural fair  By charms alone distinguish'd from the rest  And meek Simplicity neglected maid  Shall bid my fair in native graces shine  She only she shall lend her modest aid  Chaste sober priestess at sweet beauty's shrine  How sweet to muse by murmuring springs reclin'd  Or loitering careless in the shady grove  Indulge the gentlest feelings of the mind  And pity those who live to aught but love  When DELIA's hand unlocks her shining hair  And o'er her shoulder spreads the flowing gold  Base were the man who one bright tress would spare  For all the ore of India's coarser mold  By her dear side with what content I'd toil  Patient of any labour in her sight  Guide the slow plough or turn the stubborn soil  Till the last ling'ring beam of doubtful light  But softer tasks divide my DELIA's hours  To watch the firstlings at their harmless play  With welcome shade to screen the languid flowers  That sicken in the summer's parching ray  Oft will she stoop amidst her evening walk  With tender hand each bruised plant to rear  To bind the drooping lily's broken stalk  And nurse the blossoms of the infant year  When beating rains forbid our feet to roam  We'll shelter'd sit and turn the storied page  There see what passions shake the lofty dome  With mad ambition or ungovern'd rage  What headlong ruin oft involves the great  What conscious terrors guilty bosoms prove  What strange and sudden turns of adverse fate  Tear the sad virgin from her plighted love  DELIA shall read and drop a gentle tear  Then cast her eyes around the lowroof'd cot  And own the fates have dealt more kindly here  That blest with only love our little lot  For love has sworn I heard the awful vow  The wav'ring heart shall never be his care  That stoops at any baser shrine to bow  And what he cannot rule he scorns to share  My heart in DELIA is so fully blest  It has not room to lodge another joy  My peace all leans upon that gentle breast  And only there misfortune can annoy  Our silent hours shall steal unmark'd away  In one long tender calm of rural peace  And measure many a fair unblemish'd day  Of chearful leisure and poetic ease  The proud unfeeling world their lot shall scorn  Who 'midst inglorious shades can poorly dwell  Yet if some youth for gentler passions born  Shall chance to wander near our lowly cell  His feeling breast with purer flames shall glow  And leaving pomp and state and cares behind  Shall own the world has little to bestow  Where two fond hearts in equal love are join'd  OVID to his WIFE Imitated from different Parts of his TRISTIA  Jam mea cygneas imitantur tempora plumas  Inficit nigras alba senecta comas  TRIST Lib iv Eleg  MY aged head now stoops its honours low  Bow'd with the load of fifty winters' snow  And for the raven's glossy black assumes  The downy whiteness of the cygnet's plumes  Loose scatter'd hairs around my temples stray  And spread the mournful shade of sickly grey  I bend beneath the weight of broken years  Averse to change and chill'd with causeless fears  The season now invites me to retire  To the dear lares of my household fire  To homely scenes of calm domestic peace  A poet's leisure and an old man's ease  To wear the remnant of uncertain life  In the fond bosom of a faithful wife  In safe repose my last few hours to spend  Nor fearful nor impatient of their end  Thus a safe port the waveworn vessels gain  Nor tempt again the dangers of the main  Thus the proud steed when youthful glory fades  And creeping age his stiffening limbs invades  Lies stretch'd at ease on the luxuriant plain  And dreams his morning triumphs o'er again  The hardly veteran from the camp retires  His joints unstrung and feeds his household fires  Satiate with fame enjoys wellearn'd repose  And sees his stormy day serenely close  Not such my lot Severer fates decree  My shatter'd bark must plough an unknown sea  Forc'd from my native seats and sacred home  Friendless alone thro' Scythian wilds to roam  With trembling knees o'er unknown hills I go  Stiff with blue ice and heap'd with drifted snow  Pale suns there strike their feeble rays in vain  Which faintly glance against the marble plain  Red Ister there which madly lash'd the shore  His idle urn seal'd up forgets to roar  Stern winter in eternal triumph reigns  Shuts up the bounteous year and starves the plains  My failing eyes the weary waste explore  The savage mountains and the dreary shore  And vainly look for scenes of old delight  No lov'd familiar objects meet my sight  No long remember'd streams or conscious bowers  Wake the gay memory of youthful hours  I fondly hop'd content with learned ease  To walk amidst cotemporary trees  In every scene some fav'rite spot to trace  And meet in all some kind domestic face  To stretch my limbs upon my native soil  With long vacation from unquiet toil  Resign my breath where first that breath I drew  And sink into the spot from whence I grew  But if my feeble age is doom'd to try  Unusual seasons and a foreign sky  To some more genial clime let me repair  And taste the healing balm of milder air  Near to the glowing sun's directer ray  And pitch my tent beneath the eye of day  Could not the winter in my veins suffice  Without the added rage of Scythian skies  The snow of time my vital heat exhaust  And hoary age without Sarmatian frost  Ye tuneful maids who once in happier days  Beneath the myrtle grove inspir'd my lays  How shall I now your wonted aid implore  Where seek your footsteps on this savage shore  Whose ruder echoes ne'er were taught to bear  The poet's numbers or the lover's care  Yet storm and tempest are of ills the least  Which this inhospitable land infest  Society than solitude is worse  And man to man is still the greatest curse  A savage race my fearful steps surround  Practis'd in blood and disciplin'd to wound  Unknown alike to pity as to fear  Hard as their soil and as their skies severe  Skill'd in each mystery of direst art  They arm with double death the poison'd dart  Uncomb'd and horrid grows their spiky hair  Uncouth their vesture terrible their air  The lurking dagger at their side hung low  Leaps in quick vengeance on the hapless foe  No stedfast faith is here no sure repose  An armed truce is all this nation knows  The rage of battle works when battles cease  And wars are brooding in the lap of peace  Since CAESAR wills and I a wretch must be  Let me be safe at least in misery  To my sad grave in calm oblivion steal  Nor add the woes I fear to all I feel  Yet here forever here your bard must dwell  Who sung of sports and tender loves so well  Here must he live but when he yields his breath  O let him not be exil'd even in death  Lest mix'd with Scythian shades a Roman ghost  Wander on this inhospitable coast  CAESAR no more shall urge a wretch's doom  The bolt of JOVE pursues not in the tomb  To thee dear wife some friend with pious care  All that of OVID then remains shall bear  Then wilt thou weep to see me so return  And with fond passion clasp my silent urn  O check thy grief that tender bosom spare  Hurt not thy cheeks nor soil thy flowing hair  Press the pale marble with thy lips and give  One precious tear and bid my memory live  The silent dust shall glow at thy command  And the warm ashes feel thy pious hand  To a LADY With some painted FLOWERS  tibi lilia plenis  Ecce ferunt nymphae calathis  VIRGIL  FLOWERS to the fair To you these flowers I bring  And strive to greet you with an earlier spring  Flowers sweet and gay and delicate like you  Emblems of innocence and beauty too  With flowers the Graces bind their yellow hair  And flowery wreaths consenting lovers wear  Flowers the sole luxury which nature knew  In Eden's pure and guiltless garden grew  To loftier forms are rougher tasks assign'd  The sheltering oak resists the stormy wind  The tougher yew repels invading foes  And the tall pine for future navies grows  But this soft family to cares unknown  Were born for pleasure and delight alone  Gay without toil and lovely without art  They spring to cheer the sense and glad the heart  Nor blush my fair to own you copy these  Your best your sweetest empire isto please  ODE to SPRING  Hope waits upon the flowery prime  WALLER  SWEET daughter of a rough and stormy sire  Hoar Winter's blooming child delightful Spring  Whose unshorn locks with leaves  And swelling buds are crown'd  From the green islands of eternal youth  Crown'd with fresh blooms and ever springing shade  Turn hither turn thy step  O thou whose powerful voice  More sweet than softest touch of Doric reed  Or Lydian flute can sooth the madding winds  And thro' the stormy deep  Breathe thy own tender calm  Thee best belov'd the virgin train await  With songs and festal rites and joy to rove  Thy blooming wilds among  And vales and dewy lawns  With untir'd feet and cull thy earliest sweets  To weave fresh garlands for the glowing brow  Of him the favour'd youth  That prompts their whisper'd sigh  Unlock thy copious stores those tender showers  That drop their sweetness on the infant buds  And silent dews that swell  The milky ear's green stem  And feed the flowering osier's early shoots  And call those winds which thro' the whispering boughs  With warm and pleasant breath  Salute the blowing flowers  Now let me sit beneath the whitening thorn  And mark thy spreading tints steal o'er the dale  And watch with patient eye  Thy fair unfolding charms  O nymph approach while yet the temperate sun  With bashful forehead thro' the cool moist air  Throws his young maiden beams  And with chaste kisses woes  The earth's fair bosom while the streaming veil  Of lucid clouds with kind and frequent shade  Protect thy modest blooms  From his severer blaze  Sweet is thy reign but short The red dogstar  Shall scorch thy tresses and the mower's scythe  Thy greens thy flow'rets all  Remorseless shall destroy  Reluctant shall I bid thee then farewel  For O not all that Autumn's lap contains  Nor Summer's ruddiest fruits  Can aught for thee atone  Fair Spring whose simplest promise more delights  Than all their largest wealth and thro' the heart  Each joy and newborn hope  With softest influence breathes  VERSES on MRS ROWE  How from the summit of the grove she fell  And left it unharmonious  YOUNG  SUCH were the notes our chaster SAPPHO sung  And every muse dropt honey on her

Learn'd without pride a woman without art  The sweetest manners and the gentlest heart  Smooth like her verse her passions learnt to move  And her whole soul was harmony and love  Virtue that breast without a conflict gain'd  And easy like a native monarch reign'd  On earth still favour'd as by heaven approv'd  The world applauded and ALEXIS lov'd  With love with health with fame and friendship blest  And of a chearful heart the constant feast  What more of bliss sincere could earth bestow  What purer heaven could angels taste below  But bliss from earth's vain scenes too quickly flies  The golden chord is broke ALEXIS dies  Now in the leafy shade and widow'd grove  Sad PHILOMELA mourns her absent love  Now deep retir'd in FROME's enchanting vale  She pours her tuneful sorrows on the gale  Without one fond reserve the world disclaims  And gives up all her soul to heavenly flames  Yet in no useless gloom she wore her days  She lov'd the work and only shun'd the praise  Her pious hand the poor the mourner blest  Her image liv'd in every kindred breast  THYNN CARTERET BLACKMORE ORRERY approv'd  And PRIOR prais'd and noble HERTFORD lov'd  Seraphic KENN and tuneful WATTS were

her pure spirit was exhal'd in praise  Bright pattern of thy sex be thou my muse  Thy gentle sweetness thro' my soul diffuse  Let me thy palm tho' not thy laurel share  And copy thee in charity and

 WHEN blooming beauty in the noon of power  While offer'd joys demand each sprightly hour  With all that pomp of charms and winning mein  Which sure to conquer needs but to be seen  When she whose name the softest love inspires  To the husht chamber of disease retires  To watch and weep beside a parent's bed  Catch the faint voice and raise the languid head  What mixt delight each feeling heart must warm  An angel's office suits an angel's form  Thus the tall column graceful rears its head  To prop some mould'ring tower with moss o'erspread  Whose stately piles and arches yet display  The venerable graces of decay  Thus round the wither'd trunk fresh shoots are seen  To shade their parent with a chearful green  More health dear maid thy soothing presence brings  Than purest skies or salutary springs  That voice those looks such healing virtues bear  Thy sweet reviving smiles might cheer despair  On the pale lips detain the parting breath  And bid hope blossom in the shades of death  Beauty like thine could never reach a charm  So powerful to subdue so sure to warm  On her lov'd child behold the mother gaze  In weakness pleas'd and smiling thro' decays  And leaning on that breast her cares asswage  How soft a pillow for declining age  For this when that fair frame must feel decay  Ye fates protract it to a distant day  When thy approach no tumults shall impart  Nor that commanding glance strike thro' the heart  When meaner beauties shall have leave to shine  And crowds divide the homage lately thine  Not with the transient praise those charms can boast  Shall thy fair fame and gentle deeds be lost  Some pious hand shall thy weak limbs sustain  And pay thee back these generous cares again  Thy name shall flourish by the good approv'd  Thy memory honour'd and thy dust belov'd  ON THE DEATH OF MRS JENNINGS  The Author's Grandmother  Est tamen quieté puré eleganter actae aetatis  placida ac lenis senectus  Cicero de Senect  'TIS past dear venerable shade farewel  Thy blameless life thy peaceful death shall tell  Clear to the last thy setting orb has run  Pure bright and healthy like a frosty sun  And late old age with hand indulgent shed  Its mildest winter on thy favour'd head  For Heaven prolong'd her life to spread its praise  And blest her with a Patriarch's length of days  The truest praise was hers a chearful heart  Prone to enjoy and ready to impart  An Israelite indeed and free from guile  She show'd that piety and age could smile  Religion had her heart her cares her voice  'Twas her last refuge as her earliest choice  To holy Anna's spirit not more dear  The church of Israel and the house of prayer  Her spreading offspring of the fourth degree  Fill'd her fond arms and clasp'd her trembling knee  Matur'd at length for some more perfect scene  Her hopes all bright her prospects all serene  Each part of life sustain'd with equal worth  And not a wish left unfulfill'd on earth  Like a tir'd traveller with sleep opprest  Within

in dreadful murmurs sounding  He rules with wide and absolute command  O'er the broad ocean and the stedfast land  JEHOVAH reigns unbounded and alone  And all creation hangs beneath his throne  He reigns alone let no inferior nature  Usurp or share the throne of the Creator  He saw the struggling beams of infant light  Shoot thro' the massy gloom of ancient night  His spirit hush'd the elemental strife  And brooded o'er the kindling seeds of life  Seasons and months began the long procession  And measur'd o'er the year in bright succession  The joyful sun sprung up th' etherial way  Strong as a giant as a bridegroom gay  And the pale moon diffus'd her shadowy light  Superior o'er the dusky brow of night  Ten thousand glittering lamps the skies adorning  Numerous as dew drops from the womb of morning  Earth's blooming face with rising flowers he drest  And spread a verdant mantle o'er her breast  Then from the hollow of his hand he pours  The circling waters round her winding shores  The newborn world in their cool arms embracing  And with soft murmurs still her banks caressing  At length she rose complete in finish'd pride  All fair and spotless like a virgin bride  Fresh with untarnish'd lusture as she stood  Her Maker blest his work and call'd it good  The morning stars with joyful acclamation  Exulting sung and hail'd the new creation  Yet this fair world the creature of a day  Tho' built by GOD's right hand must pass away  And long oblivion creep o'er mortal things  The fate of empires and the pride of kings  Eternal night shall veil their proudest story  And drop the curtain o'er all human glory  The sun himself with weary clouds opprest  Shall in his silent dark pavilion rest  His golden urn shall broke and useless lie  Amidst the common ruins of the sky  The stars rush headlong in the wild commotion  And bathe their glittering foreheads in the ocean  But fix'd O GOD for ever stands thy throne  JEHOVAH reigns a universe alone  Th' eternal fire that feeds each vital flame  Collected or diffus'd is still the same  He dwells within his own unfathom'd essence  And fills all space with his unbounded presence  But oh our highest notes the theme debase  And silence is our least injurious praise  Cease cease your songs the daring flight controul  Revere him in the stillness of the soul  With silent duty meekly bend before him  And deep within your inmost hearts adore him  HYMN II  PRAISE to GOD immortal praise  ALTHOUGH the fig tree shall not blossom neither shall fruit be in the vines the labour of the olive shall fail and the fields shall yield no meat the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there shall be no herd in the stalls yet I will rejoice in the LORD I will joy in the GOD of my salvation  HABAKKUK iii  For the love that crowns our days  Bounteous source of every joy  Let thy praise our tongues employ  For the blessings of the field  For the stores the garden yield  For the vine's exalted juice  For the generous olive's use  Flocks that whiten all the plain  Yellow sheaves of ripen'd grain  Clouds that drop their fatt'ning dews  Suns that temperate warmth diffuse  All that Spring with bounteous hand  Scatters o'er the smiling land  All that liberal Autumn pours  From her rich o'erflowing stores  These to thee my GOD we owe  Source whence all our blessings flow  And for these my soul shall raise  Grateful vows and solemn praise  Yet should rising whirlwinds tear  From its stem the ripening ear  Should the figtree's blasted shoot  Drop her green untimely fruit  Should the vine put forth no more  Nor the olive yield her store  Though the sick'ning flocks should fall  And the herds desert the stall  Should thine alter'd hand restrain  The early and the latter rain  Blast each opening bud of joy  And the rising year destroy  Yet to thee my soul should raise  Grateful vows and solemn praise  And when every blessing's flown  Love theefor thyself alone  HYMN III  For EASTERSUNDAY  AGAIN the LORD of life and light  Awakes the kindling ray  Unseals the eyelids of the morn  And pours increasing day  O what a night was that which wrapt  The heathen world in gloom  O what a sun which broke this day  Triumphant from the tomb  This day be grateful homage paid  And loud hosannas sung  Let gladness dwell in every heart  And praise on every tongue  Ten thousand differing lips shall join  To hail this welcome morn  Which scatters blessings from its wings  To nations yet unborn  JESUS the friend of human kind  With strong compassion mov'd  Descended like a pitying GOD  To save the souls he lov'd  The powers of darkness leagued in vain  To bind his soul in death  He shook their kingdom when he fell  With his expiring breath  Not long the toils of hell could keep  The hope of JUDAH's line  Corruption never could take hold  On aught so much divine  And now his conquering chariotwheels  Ascend the lofty skies  While broke beneath his powerful cross  Death's iron sceptre lies  Exalted high at GOD's right hand  And LORD of all below  Thro' him is pardoning love dispens'd  And boundless blessings flow  And still for erring guilty man  A brother's pity flows  And still his bleeding heart is touch'd  With memory of our woes  To thee my Saviour and my king  Glad homage let me give  And stand prepar'd like thee to die  With thee that I may live  HYMN IV  BEHOLD where breathing love divine  Our dying Master stands  His weeping followers gathering round  Receive his last commands  From that mild teacher's parting lips  What tender accents fell  The gentle precept which he gave  Became its author well  "Blest is the man whose soft'ning heart  "Feels all another's pain  "To whom the supplicating eye  "Was never rais'd in vain  "Whose breast expands with generous warmth  "A stranger's woes to feel  "And bleeds in pity o'er the wound  "He wants the power to heal  "He spreads his kind supporting arms  "To every child of grief  "His secret bounty largely flows  "And brings unask'd relief  "To gentle offices of love  "His feet are never slow  "He views thro' mercy's melting eye  "A brother in a foe  "Peace from the bosom of his GOD  "My peace to him I give  "And when he kneels before the throne  "His trembling soul shall live  "To him protection shall be shewn  "And mercy from above  "Descend on those who thus fulfil  "The perfect law of love"  HYMN V  AWAKE my soul lift up thine eyes  See where thy foes against thee rise  In long array a numerous host  Awake my soul or thou art lost  Here giant danger threat'ning stands  Mustering his pale terrific bands  There pleasure's silken banners spread  And willing souls are captive led  See where rebellious passions rage  And fierce desires and lusts engage  The meanest foe of all the train  Has thousands and ten thousands slain  Thou tread'st upon enchanted ground  Perils and snares beset thee round  Beware of all guard every part  But most the traitor in thy heart  Come then my soul now learn to wield  The weight of thine immortal shield  Put on the armour from above  Of heavenly truth and heavenly love  The terror and the charm repel  And powers of earth and powers of hell  The man of Calvary triumph'd here  Why should his faithful followers fear  An ADDRESS to the DEITY  Deus est quodcunque vides quocunque moveris  LUCAN  GOD of my life and author of my days  Permit my feeble voice to lisp thy praise  And trembling take upon a mortal tongue  That hallow'd name to harps of Seraphs sung  Yet here the brightest Seraphs could no more  Than hide their faces tremble and adore  Worms angels men in every different sphere  Are equal all for all are nothing here  All nature faints beneath the mighty name  Which nature's works thro' all their parts proclaim  I feel that name my inmost thoughts controul  And breathe an awful stillness thro' my soul  As by a charm the waves of grief subside  Impetuous passion stops her headlong tide  At thy felt presence all emotions cease  And my hush'd spirit finds a sudden peace  Till every worldly thought within me dies  And earth's gay pageants vanish from my eyes  Till all my sense is lost in infinite  And one vast object fills my aching sight  But soon alas this holy calm is broke  My soul submits to wear her wonted yoke  With shackled pinions strives to soar in vain  And mingles with the dross of earth again  But he our gracious Master kind as just  Knowing our frame remembers man is dust  His spirit ever brooding o'er our mind  Sees the first wish to better hopes inclin'd  Marks the young dawn of every virtuous aim  And fans the smoaking flax into a flame  His ears are open to the softest cry  His grace descends to meet the lifted eye  He reads the language of a silent tear  And sighs are incense from a heart sincere  Such are the vows the sacrifice I give  Accept the vow and bid the suppliant live  From each terrestrial bondage set me free  Hush every wish that centers not in thee  Bid my fond hopes my vain disquiets cease  And point my path to everlasting peace  If the soft hand of winning pleasure leads  By living waters and thro' flow'ry meads  When all is smiling tranquil and serene  And vernal beauty paints the flattering scene  Oh teach me to elude each latent snare  And whisper to my sliding heartBeware  With caution let me hear the Syren's voice  And doubtful with a trembling heart rejoice  If friendless in a vale of tears I stray  Where briars wound and thorns perplex my way  Still let my steady soul thy goodness see  And with strong confidence lay hold on thee  With equal eye my various lot receive  Resign'd to die or resolute to live  Prepar'd to kiss the sceptre or the rod  While GOD is seen in all and all in GOD  I read his awful name emblazon'd high  With golden letters on th' illumin'd sky  Nor less the mystic characters I see  Wrought in each flower inscrib'd on every tree  In every leaf that trembles to the breeze  I hear the voice of GOD among the trees  With thee in shady solitudes I walk  With thee in busy crowded cities talk  In every creature own thy forming power  In each event thy providence adore  Thy hopes shall animate my drooping soul  Thy precepts guide me and thy fear controul  Thus shall I rest unmov'd by all alarms  Secure within the temple of thine arms  From anxious cares from gloomy terrors free  Aud feel myself omnipotent in thee  Then when the last the closing hour draws nigh  And earth recedes before my swimming eye  When trembling on the doubtful edge of fate  I stand and stretch my view to either state  Teach me to quit this transitory scene  With decent triumph and a look serene  Teach me to fix my ardent hopes on high  And having liv'd to thee in thee to die  A Summer Evening's Meditation  One sun by day by night ten thousand shine  YOUNG  'TIS past The sultry tyrant of the south  Has spent his shortliv'd rage more grateful hours  Move silent on the skies no more repel  The dazzled sight but with mild maiden beams  Of temper'd light invite the cherish'd eye  To wander o'er their sphere where hung aloft  DIAN's bright crescent like a silver bow  New strung in heaven lifts high its beamy horns  Impatient sor the night and seems to push  Her brother down the sky Fair VENUS shines  Even in the eye of day with sweetest beam  Propitious shines and shakes a trembling flood  Of soften'd radiance from her dewy locks  The shadows spread apace while meeken'd Eve  Her cheek yet warm with blushes slow retires  Thro' the Hesperian gardens of the west  And shuts the gates of day 'Tis now the hour  When Contemplation from her sunless haunts  The cool damp grotto or the lonely depth  Of unpierc'd woods where wrapt in solid shade  She mused away the gaudy hours of noon  And fed on thoughts unripen'd by the sun  Moves forward and with radiant finger points  To yon blue concave swell'd by breath divine  Where one by one the living eyes of heaven  Awake quick kindling o'er the face of ether  One boundless blaze ten thousand trembling fires  And dancing lustres where th' unsteady eye  Restless and dazzled wanders unconfin'd  O'er all this field of glories spacious field  And worthy of the master he whose hand  With hieroglyphics older than the Nile  Inscrib'd the mystic tablet hung on high  To public gaze and said adore O man  The finger of thy GOD From what pure wells  Of milky light what soft o'erflowing urn  Are all these lamps so fill'd these friendly lamps  For ever streaming o'er the azure deep  To point our path and light us to our home  How soft they slide along their lucid spheres  And silent as the foot of time fulfil  Their destin'd courses Nature's self is hush'd  And but a scatter'd leaf which rustles thro'  The thickwove foliage not a sound is heard  To break the midnight air tho' the rais'd ear  Intensely listening drinks in every breath  How deep the silence yet how loud the praise  But are they silent all or is there not  A tongue in every star that talks with man  And wooes him to be wise nor wooes in vain  This dead of midnight is the noon of thought  And wisdom mounts her zenith with the stars  At this still hour the selfcollected soul  Turns inward and beholds a stranger there  Of high descent and more than mortal rank  An embryo GOD a spark of fire divine  Which must burn on for ages when the sun  Fair transitory creature of a day  Has clos'd his golden eye and wrapt in shades  Forgets his wonted journey thro' the east  Ye citadels of light and seats of GODS  Perhaps my future home from whence the soul  Revolving periods past may oft look back  With recollected tenderness on all  The various busy scenes she left below  Its deep laid projects and its strange events  As on some fond and doting tale that sooth'd  Her infant hours O be it lawful now  To tread the hallow'd circle of your courts  And with mute wonder and delighted awe  Approach your burning confines Seiz'd in thought  On fancy's wild and roving wing I sail  From the green borders of the peopled earth  And the pale moon her duteous fair attendant  From solitary Mars from the vast orb  Of Jupiter whose huge gigantic bulk  Dances in ether like the lightest leaf  To the dim verge the suburbs of the system  Where chearless Saturn 'midst her wat'ry moons  Girt with a lucid zone majestic sits  In gloomy grandeur like an exil'd queen  Amongst her weeping handmaids fearless thence  I launch into the trackless deeps of space  Where burning round ten thousand suns appear  Of elder beam which ask no leave to shine  Of our terrestrial star nor borrow light  From the proud regent of our scanty day  Sons of the morning first born of creation  And only less than him who marks their track  And guides their fiery wheels Here must I stop  Or is there aught beyond What hand unseen  Impels me onward thro' the glowing orbs  Of habitable nature far remote  To the dread confines of eternal night  To solitudes of vast unpeopled space  The desarts of creation wide and wild  Where embryo systems and unkindled suns  Sleep in the womb of chaos fancy droops  And thought astonish'd stops her bold career  But oh thou mighty mind whose powerful word  Said thus let all things be and thus they were  Where shall I seek thy presence how unblam'd  Invoke thy dread perfection  Have the broad eyelids of the morn beheld thee  Or does the beamy shoulder of Orion  Support thy throne O look with pity down  On erring guilty man not in thy names  Of terrour clad not with those thunders arm'd  That conscious Sinai felt when fear appall'd  The scatter'd tribes thou hast a gentler voice  That whispers comfort to the swelling heart  Abash'd yet longing to behold her Maker  But now my soul unus'd to stretch her powers  In flight so daring drops her weary wing  And seeks again the known accustom'd spot  Drest up with sun and shade and lawns and streams  A mansion fair and spacious for its guest  And full replete with wonders Let me here  Content and grateful wait th' appointed time  And ripen for the skies the hour will come  When all these splendours bursting on my sight  Shall stand unveil'd and to my ravish'd sense  Unlock the glories of the world unknown  THE END
