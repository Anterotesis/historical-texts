 VOL V  A COLLECTION OF POEMS IN SIX VOLUMES  BY SEVERAL HANDS  LONDON Printed by J HUGHS For R and J DODSLEY at Tully'sHead in PallMall MDCCLVIII  RURAL ELEGANCE An ODE to the late Duchess of SOMERSET  Written  By WILLIAM SHENSTONE  Esq  I  WHILE orient skies restore the day  And dewdrops catch the lucid ray  Amid the sprightly scenes of morn  Will aught the Muse inspire  Oh peace to yonder clamorous horn  That drowns the sacred lyre  II  Ye rural  Thanes  that o'er the mossy down  Some panting timorous hare pursue  Does nature mean your joys alone to crown  Say does she smoothe her lawns for you  For you does Echo bid the rocks reply  And urg'd by rude constraint resound the jovial cry  III  See from the neighbouring hill forlorn  The wretched swain your sport survey  He finds his faithful fences torn  He finds his labour'd crops a prey  He sees his flockno more in circles feed  Haply beneath your ravage bleed  And with no random curses loads the deed  IV  Nor yet ye  swains  conclude  That nature smiles for you alone  Your bounded souls and your conceptions crude  The proud the selfish boast disown  Yours be the produce of the soil  O may it still reward your toil  Nor ever the defenceless train  Of clinging infants ask support in vain  V  But tho' the various harvest gild your plains  Does the mere landschape feast your eye  Or the warm hope of distant gains  Far other cause of glee supply  Is not the redstreak's future juice  The source of your delight profound  Where Ariconium pours her gems profuse  Purpling a whole horizon round  Athirst ye praise the limpid stream 'tis true  But tho' the pebbled shores among  It mimick no unpleasing fong  The limpid fountain  murmurs  not for you  VI  Unpleas'd ye see the thickets bloom  Unpleas'd the Spring her  flowery  robe resume  Unmov'd the mountain's airy pile  The dappled mead without a smile  O let a rural conscious Muse  For well she knows your froward sense accuse  Forth to the solemn oak you bring the square  And span the massy trunk before you cry 'tis fair  VII  Nor yet ye  learn'd  nor yet ye  courtly  train  If haply from your haunts ye stray  To waste with us a summer's day  Exclude the taste of  every  swain  Nor our untutor'd sense disdain  'Tis Nature only gives exclusive right  To relish her supreme delight  She where she pleases kind or coy  Who furnishes the scene and forms us to enjoy  VIII  Then hither bring the fair ingenuous mind  By her auspicious aid refin'd  Lo not an hedgerow hawthorn blows  Or humble harebell paints the plain  Or valley winds or fountain flows  Or purple heath is ting'd in vain  For such the rivers dash their foaming tides  The mountain swells the dale subsides  Ev'n thriftless furze detains their wandering sight  And the rough barren rock grows pregnant with delight  IX  With what suspicious fearful care  The sordid wretch secures his claim  If haply some luxurious heir  Should alienate the fields that wear his name  What scruples lest some future birth  Should litigate a span of earth  Bonds contracts feoffments names unmeet for prose  The towering Muse endures not to disclos  Alas  her  unrevers'd decree  More comprehensive and more free  Her lavish charter Taste appropriates all we see  X  Let gondolas their painted flags unfold  And be the solemn day enroll'd  When to confirm his lofty plea  In nuptial sort with bridal gold  The grave Venetian weds the sea  Each laughing Muse derides the vow  Ev'n Adria scorns the mock embrace  To some lone  hermit  on the mountain's brow  Allotted from his natal hour  With all her myrtle shores in dow'r  His breast to admiration prone  Enjoys the smile upon her face  Enjoys triumphant every grace  And finds her more his own  XI  Fatigu'd with form's oppressive laws  When SOMERSET avoids the Great  When cloy'd with merited applause  She seeks the rural calm retreat  Does she not praise each mossy cell  And feel the truth my numbers tell  When deafen'd by the loud acclaim  Which genius grac'd with rank obtains  Could she not more delighted hear  Yon throstle chaunt the rising year  Could she not spurn the wreaths of fame  To crop the primrose of the plains  Does she not sweets in each fair valley find  Lost to the sons of pow'r unknown to half mankind  XII  Ah can she covet there to see  The splendid slaves the reptile race  That oil the tongue and bow the knee  That slight her merit but adore her place  Far happier if aright I deem  When from gay throngs and gilded spires  To where the  lonely  halcyons play  Her philosophic step retires  While studious of the moral theme  She to some smooth sequester'd stream  Likens the swain's inglorious day  Pleas'd from the flowery margin to survey  How cool serene and clear the current glides away  XIII  O blind to truth to virtue blind  Who slight the sweetlypensive mind  On whose fair birth the Graces mild  And every Muse prophetic smil'd  Not that the poet's boasted fire  Should Fame's wideechoing trumpet swell  Or on the music of his lyre  Each futute age with rapture dwell  The vaunted sweets of praise remove  Yet shall  such  bosoms claim a part  In all that glads the human heart  Yet these the spirits form'd to judge and prove  All nature's charms immense and Heav'n's unbounded love  XIV  And oh the transport most ally'd to song  In some fair villa's peaceful bound  To catch soft hints from Nature's tongue  And bid Arcadia bloom around  Whether we fringe the sloping hill  Or smoothe below the verdant mead  Whether we break the falling rill  Or thro' meandering mazes load  Or in the horrid bramble's room  Bid careless groups of roses bloom  Or let some shelter'd lake serene  Reflect flow'rs woods and spires and brighten all the scene  XV  O sweet disposal of the rural hour  O beauties never known to cloy  While worth and genius haunt the favour'd bow'r  And every  gentle  breast partakes the joy  While  Charity  at eve surveys the swain  Enabled by these toils to chear  A train of helpless infants dear  Speed whistling home across the plain  Sees vagrant  Luxury  her handmaid grown  For half her graceless deeds attone  And hails the bounteous work and ranks it with her own  XVI  Why brand these pleasures with the name  Of soft unsocial toils of indolence and shame  Search but the garden or the wood  Let yon admir'd carnation own  Not  all  was meant for raiment or for food  Not  all  for needful use alone  There while the seeds of future blossoms dwell  Tis colour'd for the sight perfum'd to please the smell  XVII  Why knows the nightingale to sing  Why flows the pine's nectareous juice  Why shines with paint the linnet's wing  For sustenance alone for use  For preservation Every sphere  Shall bid fair  Pleasure's  rightful claim appear  And sure there seem of  human  kind  Some  born to shun the solemn strife  Some for  amusive  tasks design'd  To soothe the certain ills of life  Grace it's lone vales with many a budding rose  New founts of bliss disclose  Call forth resreshing shades and decorate repose  XVIII  From plains and woodlands from the view  Of rural Nature's blooming face  Smit with the glare of rank and place  To courts the sons of Fancy flew  There  long had Art ordain'd a rival seat  There had she lavish'd all her care  To form a scene more dazling fair  And call'd them from their green retreat  To share her proud controul  Had giv'n the robe with grace to flow  Had taught exotick gems to glow  And emulous of nature's pow'r  Mimick'd the plume the leaf the flow'r  Chang'd the complexion's native hue  Moulded each rustick limb anew  And warp'd the very soul  XIX  Awhile her magick strikes the novel eye  Awhile the faery forms delight  And now aloof we seem to fly  On purple pinions thro' a purer sky  Where all is wonderous all is bright  Now landed on some spangled shore  Awhile each dazled maniac roves  By saphire lakes thro' em'rald groves  Paternal acres please no more  Adieu the simple the sincere delight  Th' habitual scene of hill and dale  The rural herds the vernal gale  The tangled vetch's purple bloom  The fragrance of the bean's perfume  Be theirs alone who cultivate the soil  And drink the cup of thirst and eat the bread of toil  XX  But soon the pageant fades away  'Tis  Nature  only bears perpetual sway  We pierce the counterfeit delight  Fatigu'd with splendour's irksome beams  Fancy again demands the sight  Of native groves and wonted streams  Pants for the scenes that charm'd her youthful eyes  Where Truth maintains her court and banishes disguise  XXI  Then hither oft ye senators retire  With  Nature  here high converse hold  For who like STAMFORD her delights admire  Like STAMFORD shall with scorn behold  Th' unequal bribes of pageantry and gold  Beneath the British oak's majestick shade  Shall see fair Truth immortal maid  Friendship in artless guise array'd  Honour and moral Beauty shine  With more attractive charms with radiance more divine  XXII  Yes here alone did highest Heav'n ordain  The lasting magazine of charms  Whatever wins whatever warms  Whatever fancy seeks to share  The  great  the  various  and the  fair  For ever should remain  XXIII  Her impulse nothing may restrain  Or whence the joy 'mid columns tow'rs  'Midst all the city's artful trim  To rear some breathless vapid flow'rs  Or shrubs fuliginously grim  From rooms of silken foliage vain  To trace the dun far distant grove  Where smit with undissembled pain  The wooklark mourns her absent love  Borne to the dusty town from native air  To mimick rural life and soothe some vapour'd fair  XXIV  But how must faithless  Art  prevail  Should all who taste our joy sincere  To virtue truth or science dear  Forego a court's alluring pale  For dimpled brook and leafy grove  For that rich luxury of thought they love  Ah no from these the publick sphere requires  Example for it's giddy bands  From these impartial Heav'n demands  To spread the flame itself inspires  To sift Opinion's mingled mass  Impress a nation's taste and bid the sterling pass  XXV  Happy thrice happy they  Whose graceful deeds have exemplary shone  Round the gay precincts of a throne  With mild effective beams  Who bands of fair ideas bring  By solemn grott or shady spring  To join their pleasing dreams  Theirs is the rural bliss without alloy  They only that deserve enjoy  What tho' nor fabled Dryad haunt their grove  Nor Naiad near their fountains rove  Yet all embody'd to the mental sight  A train of smiling Virtues bright  Shall there the wise retreat allow  Shall twine triumphant palms to deck the wanderer's brow  XXVI  And though by faithless friends alarm'd  Art have with Nature wag'd prefumptuous war  By SEYMOUR's winning influence charm'd  In whom their gifts united shine  No longer shall their counsels jar  'Tis hers to mediate the peace  Near Percylodge with awestruck mien  The rebel seeks her lawful Queen  And havock and contention cease  I see the rival pow'rs combine  And aid each other's fair design  Nature exalt the mound where Art shall build  Art shape the gay alcove while Nature paints the field  XXVII  Begin ye songsters of the grove  O warble forth your noblest lay  Where SOMERSET vouchsafes to rove  Ye leverets freely sport and play  Peace to the strepent horn  Let no harsh dissonance disturb the morn  No sounds inelegant and rude  Her sacred solitudes profane  Unless her candour not exclude  The lowly shepherd's votive strain  Who tunes his reed amidst his rural chear  Fearful yet not averse that SOMERSET should hear  Inscription near a Sheepcote  By the Same  SHepherd would'st thou here obtain  Pleasure unalloy'd with pain  Joy that suits the rural sphere  Gentle shepherd lend an ear  Learn to relish calm delight  Verdant vales and fountains bright  Trees that nod on sloping hills  Caves that echo tinkling rills  If thou can'st no charm disclose  In the simplest bud that blows  Go forsake thy plain and fold  Join the crowd and toil for gold  Tranquil pleasures never cloy  Banish each tumultuous joy  All but lovefor love inspires  Fonder wishes fiercer fires  Love and all its joys be thine  Yet ere thou the reins resign  Hear what reason seems to say  Hear attentive and obey  "Crimson leaves the rose adorn  "But beneath 'em lurks a thorn  "Fair and flowery is the brake  "Yet it hides the vengeful snake  "Think not she whose empty pride  "Dares the fleecy garb deride  "Think not she who light and vain  "Scorns the sheep can love the swain  "Artless deed and simple dress  "Mark the chosen shepherdess  "Thoughts by decency controul'd  "Well conceiv'd and freely told  "Sense that shuns each conscious air  "Wit that falls ere well aware  "Generous pity prone to sigh  "If her kid or lambkin die  "Let not lucre let not pride  "Draw thee from such charms aside  "Have not those their proper sphere  "Gentler passions triumph here  "See to sweeten thy repose  "The blossom buds the fountain flows  "Lo to crown thy healthful board  "All that milk and fruits afford  "Seek no morethe rest is vain  "Pleasure ending soon in pain  "Anguish lightly gilded o'er  "Close thy wish and seek no more"  NANCY of the VALE A BALLAD  Nerine Galatea thymo mihi dulcior Hyblae  Candidior cygnis hederâ formosior albâ  By the Same  THE western sky was purpled o'er  With every pleasing ray  And flocks reviving felt no more  The sultry heats of day  When from an hazle's artless bower  Softwarbled Strephon's tongue  He blest the  scene  he blest the  hour  While Nancy's praise he sung  "Let fops with fickle falshood range  The paths of wanton love  Whilst weeping maids lament their change  And sadden every grove  But endless blessings crown the day  I saw fair Esham's dale  And every blessing find its way  To Nancy of the Vale  'Twas from Avona's banks the maid  Diffus'd her lovely beams  And every shining glance display'd  The Naid of the streams  Soft as the wildduck's tender young  That float on Avon's tide  Bright as the waterlily sprung  And glittering near its side  Fresh as the bordering flowers her bloom  Her eye all mild to view  The little halcyon's azure plume  Was never half so blue  Her shape was like the reed so sleek  So taper strait and fair  Her dimpled smile her blushing cheek  How charming sweet they were  Far in the winding Vale retir'd  This peerless bud I found  And shadowing rocks and woods conspir'd  To fence her beauties round  That Nature in so lone a dell  Should form a Nymph so sweet  Or Fortune to her secret cell  Conduct my wandering feet  Gay lordlings sought her for their bride  But she would ne'er incline  "Prove to your equals true she cry'd  "As I will prove to mine  " 'Tis Strephon on the mountain's brow  "Has won my right good will  "To him I gave my plighted vow  "With him I'll climb the hill"  Struck with her charms and gentle truth  I clasp'd the constant fair  To her alone I gave my youth  And vow my future care  And when this vow shall faithless prove  Or I those charms forego  The stream that saw our tender love  That stream shall cease to flow  ODE to INDOLENCE  By the Same  AH why for ever on the wing  Persists my weary'd soul to roam  Why ever cheated strives to bring  Or pleasure or contentment home  Thus the poor bird that draws his name  From paradise's honour'd groves  Ceaseless fatigues his little frame  Nor finds the resting place he loves  Lo on the rural mossy bed  My limbs with careless ease reclin'd  Ah gentle Sloth indulgent spread  The same soft bandage o'er my mind  For why should lingering thought invade  Yet every worldly prospect cloy  Lend me soft Sloth thy friendly aid  And give me peace debarr'd of joy  Lov'st thou you calm and silent flood  That never ebbs that never flows  Protected by the circling wood  From each tempestuous wind that blows  An altar on it's bank shall rise  Where oft thy votary shall be found  What time pale Autumn lulls the skies  And sickening verdure fades around  Ye busy race ye factious train  That haunt Ambition's guilty shrine  No more perplex the world in vain  But offer here your vows with mine  And thou puissant Queen be kind  If e'er I shar'd thy balmy pow'r  If e'er I sway'd my active mind  To weave for Thee the rural bow'r  Dissolve in sleep each anxious care  Each unavailing sigh remove  And only let me wake to share  The sweets of Friendship and of Love  ODE to HEALTH  By the Same  O HEAL'TH capricious maid  Why dost thou shun my peaceful bow'r  Where I had hope to share thy pow'r  And bless thy lasting aid  Since thou alas art flown  It' vails not whether Muse or Grace  With tempting smile frequent the place  I sigh for thee alone  Age not forbids thy stay  Thou yet might'st act the friendly part  Thou yet might'st raise this languid heart  Why speed so swift away  Thou scorn'st the cityair  I breathe fresh gales o'er furrow'd ground  Yet hast not thou my wishes crown'd  O false O partial fair  I plunge into the wave  And tho' with purest hands I raise  A rural altar to thy praise  Thou wilt not deign to save  Amid my wellknown grove  Where mineral fountains vainly bear  Thy boasted name and titles fair  Why scorns thy foot to rove  Thou hear'st the sportsman's claim  Enabling  him  with idle noise  To drown the Muse's melting voice  And fright the timorous game  Is Thought thy foe adieu  Ye midnight lamps ye curious tomes  Mine eye o'er hill and valley roams  And deals no more with you  Is it the Clime you flee  Yet 'midst his unremitting snows  The poor Laponian's bosom glows  And shares bright rays from thee  There was there was a time  When tho' I scorn'd thy guardian care  Nor made a vow nor said a pray'r  It did not rue the crime  Who then more blest than me  When the glad schoolboy's task was done  And forth with jocund sprite I run  To freedom and to glee  How jovial then the day  What since have all my labours found  Thus climbing life to gaze around  That can thy loss repay  Wert thou alas but kind  Methinks no frown that Fortune wears  Nor lessen'd hopes nor growing cares  Could sink my chearful mind  Whate'er my stars include  What  other  breasts convert to pain  My towering mind should soon disdain  Should scornIngratitude  Repair this mouldering cell  And blest with objects found at home  And envying none their fairer dome  How pleas'd my soul should dwell  Temperance should guard the doors  From room to room should Memory stray  And ranging all in neat array  Enjoy her pleasing stores  There let them rest unknown  The types of many a pleasing scene  But to preserve them bright or clean  Is thine fair Queen alone  To a LADY of QUALITY Fitting up her LIBRARY  By the Same  AH what is Science what is Art  Or what the pleasure these impart  Ye trophies which the Learn'd pursue  Through endless fruitless toils adieu  What can the tedious tomes bestow  To soothe the miseries they show  What like the bliss for  him  decreed  Who tends his flock and tunes his reed  Say wretched Fancy thus refin'd  From all that glads the simplest hind  How rare that object which supplies  A charm for too discerning eyes  The polish'd bard of genius vain  Endures a deeper sense of pain  As each invading blast devours  The richest fruits the fairest flow'rs  Sages with irksome waste of time  The steep ascent of Knowledge climb  Then from the tow'ring heights they scale  Behold Contentment rangethe vale  Yet why Asteria tell us why  We scorn the crowd when you are nigh  Why then does reason seem so fair  Why learning then deserve our care  Who can unpleas'd your shelves behold  While you so fair a proof unfold  What force the brightest genius draws  From polish'd Wisdom's written laws  Where are our humbler tenets flown  What strange perfection bids us own  That Bliss with toilsome Science dwells  And happiest he who most excels  UPON A VISIT to the same in Winter  By the Same  I  ON fair Asteria's blissful plains  Where everblooming Fancy reigns  How pleas'd we pass the winter's day  And charm the dulley'd Spleen away  II  No linnet from the leafless bough  Pours forth her note melodious now  But all admire Asteria's tongue  Nor  wish  the linnet's vernal song  III  No flow'rs emit their transient rays  Yet sure Asteria's wit displays  More various tints more glowing lines  And with  perennial  beauty shines  IV  Tho' rifled groves and fetter'd streams  But ill befriend a poet's dreams  Asteria's presence wakes the lyre  And well supplies poetick fire  V  The fields have lost their lovely dye  No chearful azure decks the sky  Yet still we bless the louring day  Asteria smilesand all is gay  VI  Hence let the Muse no more presume  To blame the Winter's dreary gloom  Accuse his loitering hours no more  But ah their envious  haste  deplore  VII  For soon from wit and friendship's reign  The social hearth the sprightly vein  I goto meet the coming year  On savage plains and deserts drear  VIII  I goto feed on pleasures flown  Nor find the spring my loss atone  But 'mid the flowery sweets of May  With pride recal this winter's day  An irregular ODE after SICKNESS  By the Same  Melius cum venerit Ipsa canemus  I  TOO long a stranger to repose  At length from Pain's abhorred couch I rose  And wander'd forth alone  To court once more the balmy breeze  And catch the verdure of the trees  Ere yet their charms were flown  II  'Twas from a bank with pansies gay  I hail'd once more the chearful day  The sun's forgotten beams  O sun how pleasing were thy rays  Reflected from the polish'd face  Of yon refulgent streams  III  Rais'd by the scene my feeble tongue  Essay'd again the sweets of song  And thus in feeble strains and slow  The loitering numbers' gan to flow  IV  "Come gentle air my languid limbs restore  "And bid me welcome from the Stygian shore  "For sure I heard the tender sighs  "I seem'd to join the plaintive cries  "Of hapless youths who thro' the myrtle grove  "Bewail for ever their unfinish'd love  "To that unjoyous clime  "Torn from the sight of these etherial skies  "Debarr'd the lustre of their Delia's eyes  "And banish'd in their prime  V  "Come gentle Air and while the thickets bloom  "Convey the jasmin's breath divine  "Convey the woodbine's rich perfume  "Nor spare the sweetleaft eglantine  "And may'st thou shun the rugged storm  "Till Health her wonted charms explain  "With rural pleasure in her train  "To greet me in her fairest form  "While from this lofty mount I view  "The sons of earth the vulgar crew  "Anxious for futile gains beneath me stray  "And seek with erring step Contentment's obvious way  VI  "Come gentle Air and thou celestial Muse  "Thy genial flame infuse  "Enough to lend a pensive bosom aid  "And gild Retirement's gloomy shade  "Enough to rear such rustic lays  "As foes may slight but partial friends will praise"  VII  The gentle Air allow'd my claim  And more to chear my drooping frame  She mix'd the balm of opening flowers  Such as the bee with chymic powers  From Hybla's fragrant hill inhales  Or scent Sabea's blooming vales  But ah the Nymphs that heal the pensive mind  By prescripts more refin'd  Neglect their votary's anxious moan  Oh how should They relievethe Muses all were flown  VIII  By flowery plain or woodland shades  I fondly sought the charming maids  By woodland shades or flow'ry plain  I sought them faithless maids in vain  When lo in happier hour  I leave behind my native mead  To range where zeal and friendship lead  To visit *****'s honor'd bower  Ah foolish man to seek the tuneful maids  On  other  plains or near less verdant shades  IX  Scarce have my footsteps press'd the favor'd ground  When sounds etherial strike my ear  At once celestial forms appear  My fugitives are found  The Muses  here  attune their lyres  Ah partial with unwonted fires  Here hand in hand with careless mien  The sportive Graces trip the green  X  But whilst I wander'd o'er a scene so fair  Too well at one survey I trace  How every Muse and every Grace  Had long employ'd their care  Lurks not a stone enrich'd with lively stain  Blooms not a flower amid the vernal store  Falls not a plume on India's distant plain  Glows not a shell on Adria's rocky shore  But torn methought from native lands or seas  From their arrangement gain fresh pow'r to please  XI  And some had bent the wildering maze  Bedeckt with every shrub that blows  And some entwin'd the willing sprays  To shield th' illustrious Dame's repose  Others had grac'd the sprightly dome  And taught the portrait where to glow  Others arrang'd the curious tome  Or 'mid the decorated space  Assign'd the laurel'd bust a place  And given to learning all the pomp of show  And now from every task withdrawn  They met and frisk'd it o'er the lawn  XII  Ah woe is me said I  And ***'s hilly circuit heard my cry  Have I for this with labour strove  And lavish'd all my little store  To fence for you my shady grove  And scollop every winding shore  And fringe with every purple rose  The saphire stream that down my valley flows  XIII  Ah lovely treacherous maids  To quit unseen my votive shades  When pale disease and torturing pain  Had torn me from the breezy plain  And to a restless couch confin'd  Who ne'er your wonted tasks declin'd  She needs not your officious aid  To swell the song or plan the shade  By genuine Fancy fir'd  Her native Genius guides her hand  And while she marks the sage command  More lovely scenes her skill shall raise  Her lyre resound with nobler lays  Than ever you inspir'd  Thus I my rage and grief display  But vainly blame and vainly mourn  Nor will a Grace or Muse return  Till LUXBOROUCH lead the way  ANACREONTICK  By the Same  'TWAS in a cool Aonian glade  The wanton Cupid spent with toil  Had sought refreshment from the shade  And stretch'd him on the mossy soil  A vagrant Muse drew nigh and found  The subtle traitor fast asleep  And is it thine to snore profound  She said yet leave the world to weep  But hushfrom this auspicious hour  The world I ween may rest in peace  And robb'd of darts and stript of pow'r  Thy peevish petulance decrease  Sleep on poor child whilst I withdraw  And this thy vile artillery hide  When the Castalian fount she saw  And plung'd his arrows in the tide  That magic fountilljudging maid  Shall cause you soon to curse the day  You dar'd the shafts of Love invade  And gave his arms redoubled sway  For in a stream so wonderous clear  When angry Cupid searches round  Will not the radiant points appear  Will not the furtive spoils be found  Too soon they were and every dart  Dipt in the Muse's mystic spring  Acquir'd new force to wound the heart  And taught at once to  love  and  sing  Then farewell ye Pierian quire  For who will now your altars throng  From Love we learn to swell the lyre  And Echo asks no sweeter song  ODE Written  By the Same  Urit  spes animi credula mutui  HOR  'TWAS not by beauty's aid alone  That love usurp'd his airy throne  His boasted power display'd  'Tis kindness that secures his aim  'Tis hope that feeds the kindling flame  Which beauty first convey'd  In Clara's eyes the lightnings view  Her lips with all the rose's hue  Have all its sweets combin'd  Yet vain the blush and faint the fire  'Till lips at once and eyes conspire  To prove the charmer kind  Tho' wit might gild the tempting snare  With softest accent sweetest air  By Envy's self admir'd  If Lesbia's wit betray'd her scorn  In vain might every grace adorn  What every Muse inspir'd  Thus airy Strephon tun'd his lyre  He scorn'd the pangs of wild desire  Which lovesick swains endure  Resolv'd to brave the keenest dart  Since frowns could never wound his heart  And smilesmust ever cure  But ah how false these maxims prove  How frail security from love  Experience hourly shows  Love can imagin'd smiles supply  On every charming lip and eye  Eternal sweets bestows  In vain we trust the Fairone's eyes  In vain the sage explores the skies  To learn from stars his fate  'Till led by fancy wide astray  He finds no planet mark his way  Convinc'd and wisetoo late  As partial to their words we prove  Then boldly join the lists of love  With towering hopes supply'd  So heroes taught by doubtful shrines  Mistook their Deity's designs  Then took the fieldand dy'd  The DYING KID  By the Same  Optima quaeque dies miseris mortalibus aevi  Prima fugit  VIRG  A TEAR bedews my Delia's eye  To think you playful kid must die  From crystal spring and flowery mead  Must in his prime of life recede  Erewhile in sportive circles round  She saw him wheel and frisk and bound  From rock to rock pursue his way  And on the fearful margin play  Pleas'd on his various freaks to dwell  She saw him climb my rustic cell  Thence eye my lawns with verdure bright  And seem all ravish'd at the sight  She tells with what delight he stood  To trace his features in the flood  Then skip'd aloof with quaint amaze  And then drewnear again to gaze  She tells me how with eager speed  He flew to hear my vocal reed  And how with critic face profound  And stedfast ear devour'd the sound  His every frolic light as air  Deserves the gentle Delia's care  And tears bedew her tender eye  To think the playful kid must die  But knows my Delia timely wise  How soon this blameless aera flies  While violence and craft succeed  Unfair design and ruthless deed  Soon would the vine his wounds deplore  And yield her purple gifts no more  Ah soon eras'd from every grove  Were Delia's name and Strephon's love  No more those bow'rs might Strephon see  Where first he fondly gaz'd on thee  No more those beds of flow'rets find  Which for thy charming brows he twin'd  Each wayward passion soon would tear  His bosom now so void of care  And when they left his ebbing vein  What but insipid age remain  Then mourn not the decrees of fate  That gave his life so short a date  And I will join thy tenderest sighs  To think that youth so swiftly flies  LOVE SONGS written between the Year and  By the Same  SONG I  I Told my nymph I told her true  My fields were small my flocks were few  While faltering accents spoke my fear  That Flavia might not prove sincere  Of crops destroy'd by vernal cold  And vagrant sheep that left my fold  Of these she heard yet bore to hear  And is not Flavia then sincere  How chang'd by Fortune's fickle wind  The friends I lov'd became unkind  She heard and shed a generous tear  And is not Flavia then sincere  How if she deign'd my love to bless  My Flavia must not hope for dress  This too she heard and smil'd to hear  And Flavia sure must be sincere  Go shear your flocks ye jovial swains  Go reap the plenty of your plains  Despoil'd of all which you revere  I know my Flavia's love sincere  SONG II The LANDSKIP  HOW pleas'd within my native bowers  Erewhile I pass'd the day  Was ever scene so deck'd with flowers  Were ever flowers so gay  How sweetly smil'd the hill the vale  And all the landskip round  The river gliding down the dale  The hill with beeches crown'd  But now when urg'd by tender woes  I speed to meet my dear  That hill and stream my zeal oppose  And check my fond career  No more since Daphne was my theme  Their wonted charms I see  That verdant hill and silver stream  Divide my love and me  SONG III  YE gentle nymphs and generous dames  That rule o'er every British mind  Be sure ye soothe their amorous flames  Be sure your laws are not unkind  For hard it is to wear their bloom  In unremitting sighs away  To mourn the night's oppressive gloom  And faintly bless the rising day  And cruel 'twere a freeborn swain  A British youth should vainly moan  Who scornful of a tyrant's chain  Submits to yours and yours alone  Nor pointed spear nor links of steel  Could e'er those gallant minds subdue  Who beauty's wounds with pleasure feel  And  boast  the fetters wrought by  you  SONG IV The SKYLARK  GO tuneful bird that glad'st the skies  To Daphne's window speed thy way  And there on quivering pinions rise  And there thy vocal art display  And if she deign thy notes to hear  And if she praise thy matin song  Tell her the sounds that soothe her ear  To Damon's native plains belong  Tell her in livelier plumes array'd  The bird from Indian groves may shine  But ask the lovely partial maid  What are his notes compar'd to thine  Then bid her treat you witless beau  And all his flaunting race with scorn  And lend an ear to Damon's woe  Who sings her praise and sings forlorn  SONG V  Ah ego non aliter tristes evincere morbos  Optarim quam te sic quoque velle putem  ON every tree in every plain  I trace the jovial spring in vain  A sickly languor veils mine eyes  And fast my waning vigor flies  Nor flow'ry plain nor budding tree  That smile on others smile on me  Mine eyes from death shall court repose  Nor shed a tear before they close  What bliss to me can seasons bring  Or what the needless pride of spring  The cypress bough that suits the bier  Retains its verdure all the year  'Tis true my vine so fresh and fair  Might claim awhile my wonted care  My rural store some pleasure yield  So white a flock so green a field  My friends that each in kindness vie  Might well expect one parting sigh  Might well demand one tender tear  For when was Damon unsincere  But ere I ask once more to view  Yon setting sun his race renew  Inform me swains my friends declare  Will pitying Delia join the prayer  SONG VI The Attribute of VENUS  YES Fulvia is like Venus fair  Has all her bloom and shape and air  But still to perfect every grace  She wantsthe smile upon her face  The crown majestic Juno wore  And Cynthia's brow the crescent bore  An helmet mark'd Minerva's mien  But smiles distinguish'd Beauty's qucen  Her train was form'd of smiles and loves  Her chariot drawn by gentlest doves  And from her zone the nymph may find  'Tis Beauty's province to be kind  Then smile my fair and all whose aim  Aspires to paint the Cyprian dame  Or bid her breathe in living stone  Shall take their forms from you alone  The Rape of the TRAP a BALLAD written at College  By the Same  'TWAS in a land of learning  The Muse's favourite station  Such pranks of late  Were play'd by a rat  As gave them consternation  All in a collegestudy  Where books were in great plenty  This rat would devour  More sense in an hour  Than I could writein twenty  His breakfast half the morning  He constantly attended  And when the bell rung  For eveningsong  His dinner scarce was ended  Huge tomes of geography  And maps lay all in flutter  A river or a sea  Was to him a dish of tea  And a kingdombread and butter  Such havoc spoil and rapine  With grief my Muse rehearses  How freely he would dine  On some bulky schooldivine  And for deserteat verses  He spar'd not ev'n heroics  On which we poets pride us  And would make no more  Of  King Arthurs  by the score  Thanall the world beside does  But if the desperate potion  Might chance to overdose him  To check its rage  He took a page  Of logic to compose him  A trap in haste and anger  Was bought you need not doubt on't  And such was the gin  Were a lion once in  He could not I think get out on't  With cheese not books 'twas baited  The fact I'll not bely it  Since none I tell ye that  Whether scholar or rat  Minds books when he has other diet  But more of trap and bait sir  Why should I singor either  Since the rat with mickle pride  All their sophistry defy'd  And dragg'd them away together  Both trap and bait were vanish'd  Thro' a fracture in the flooring  Which tho' so trim  It  now  may seem  Had then a doz'n or more in  Then answer this ye sages  Nor think I mean to wrong ye  Had the rat who thus did seize on  The trap less claim to reason  Than many a sage among ye  Dan Prior's mice I own it  Were vermin of condition  But the rat who chiefly learn'd  What rats alone concern'd  Was the deeper politician  That England's topsyturvy  Is clear from these mishaps sir  Since traps we may determine  Will no longer take our vermin  But vermin take our traps sir  Let sophs by rats infested  Then trust in  cats  to catch 'em  Lest they prove the utter bane  Of our  studies  where

squire  To bring down a wife whom the swains might admire  But in spite of whatever the  mortal  could say  The  goddess  objected the length of the way  To give up the op'ra the park and the ball

hearts nor death nor anguish fear  This  future transport  that  to life the way  Then let us timely for our flight prepare  And form the soul for her divine abode  Obey the call and trust the Leader's care  To bring us safe thro' Virtue's paths to God  Let no fond love for earth exact a sigh  No doubts divert our steddy steps aside  Nor let us long to live nor dread to die  Heav'n is our Hope and Providence our Guide  PART II  Written April  AT length the winter's surly blasts are o'er  Array'd in smiles the lovely spring returns  Health to the breeze unbars the screaming door  And ev'ry breast with heat celestial burns  Again the daises peep the violets blow  Again the tenants of the leafy grove  Forget the patt'ring hail the driving snow  Resume the lay to melody and love  And see my Delia see o'er yonder stream  Where on the sunny bank the lambkins play  Alike attracted to th' enliv'ning gleam  The strangerswallows take their wonted way  Welcome ye gentle tribe your sports pursue  Welcome again to Delia and to me  Your peaceful councils on my roof renew  And plan your settlements from danger free  No tempest on my shed its fury pours  My frugal hearth no noxious blast supplies  Go wand'rers go repair your sooty bow'rs  Think on no hostile roof my chimnies rise  Again I'll listen to your grave debates  I'll think I hear your various maxims told  Your numbers leaders policies and states  Your limits settled and your tribes enroll'd  I'll think I hear you tell of distant lands  What insectnations rise from Egypt's mud  What painted swarms subsist on Lybia's sands  What mild Euphrates yields and Ganges' flood  Thrice happy race whom Nature's call invites  To travel o'er her realms with active wing  To taste her choicest stores her best delights  The summer's radiance and the sweets of spring  While we are doom'd to bear the restless change  Of shifting seasons vapours dark or dry  Forbid like you to milder climes to range  When wintry clouds deform the troubled sky  But know the period to your joys assign'd  Know ruin hovers o'er this earthly ball  Certain as fate and sudden as the wind  Its secret adamantine props shall fall  Yet when your shortliv'd summers shine no more  My patient mind sworn foe to vice's way  Sustain'd on lighter wings than yours shall soar  To fairer realms beneath a brighter ray  To plains etherial and Elysian bowers  Where wintry storms no rude access obtain  Where blasts no lightning and no thunder low'rs  But spring and joy unchang'd for ever reign  VALENTINE's Day  By the Same  THE tuneful choir in amorous strains  Accost their feather'd loves  While each fond mate with equal pains  The tender suit approves  With chearful hop from spray to spray  They sport along the meads  In social bliss together stray  Where love or fancy leads  Thro' spring's gay scenes each happy pair  Their fluttering joys pursue  Its various charms and produce share  For ever kind and true  Their spritely notes from every shade  Their mutual loves proclaim  Till winter's chilling blasts invade  And damp th' enlivening flame  Then all the jocund scene declines  Nor woods nor meads delight  The drooping tribe in secret pines  And mourns th' unwelcome sight  Go blissful warblers timely wise  Th' instructive moral tell  Nor thou their  meaning  lays despise  My charming Annabelle  The SCAVENGERS A Town Eclogue In the Manner of SWIFT  By the Same  AWAKE my Muse prepare a loftier theme  The winding valley and the dimpled stream  Delight not all quit quit the verdant field  And try what dusty streets and alleys yield  Where  Avon  wider flows and gathers fame  A town there stands and  Warwick  is its name  For useful arts entitled once to share  The Mercian dame  Elfleda's  guardian care  Nor less for feats of chivalry renown'd  When her own  Gay  was with her laurels crown'd  Now indolence subjects the drowsy place  And binds in silken bonds her feeble race  No busy artisans their fellows greet  No loaded carriages obstruct the street  Scarce here and there a sauntring band is seen  And pavements dread the turf's incroaching green  Last of the toiling race there liv'd a pair  Bred up in labour and inur'd to care  To sweep the streets their task from sun to sun  And seek the nastiness that others shun  More plodding hind or dame you ne'er shall see  He gaffer  Pestel  hight and gammer she  As at their door they sate one summer's day  Old  Pestel  first essay'd the plaintive lay  His gentle mate the plaintive lay return'd  And thus alternately their grief they mourn'd  O P Alas was ever such fine weather seen  How dusty are the roads the streets how clean  How long ye almanacks will it be dry  Empty my  cart  how long and idle I  Once other days and diff'rent fate we knew  That  something had to carry  I  to do  Now e'en at best the times are none so good  But 'tis hard work to scrape a livelihood  The cattle in the stalls resign their life  And baulk the shambles and the bloody knife  Th' affrighted farmer pensive sits at home  And turnpikes threaten to compleat my doom  WIFE Well for the turnpike that will do no hurt  The roads they say are n't much the better for't  But much I fear this murrain where 'twill end  For sure the cattle did our door befriend  Oft have I prais'd them as they stalk'd along  Their fat the butchers pleas'd but me their dung  O P See what a little dab of dirt is here  But yields all Warwick more O tell me where  Lo where this antlike hillock scarce is seen  Heaps upon heaps and loads on loads have been  Bigger and bigger the proud dunghill grew  'Till my diminish'd house was hid from view  WIFE Ah gaffer  Pestel  what brave days were those  When higher than our house our muckhill rose  The growing mount I view'd with joyful eyes  And mark'd what each load added to its size  Wrapt in its fragrant steam we often sate  And to its praises held delightful chat  Nor did I e'er neglect my mite to pay  To swell the goodly heap from day to day  For this each morn I plied the stubbedbroom  'Till I scarce hobbled o'er my surrow'd room  For this I squat me on my hams each night  And mingle profit sweet with sweet delight  A cabbage once I bought but small the cost  Nor do I think the farthing all was lost  Again you sold its well digested store  To dung the garden where it grew before  O P What tho' the boys and boylike fellows jeer'd  And at the scavenger's employment sneer'd  Yet then at night content I told my gains  And thought well paid their malice and my pains  Why toils the merchant but to swell his store  Why craves the wealthy landlord still for more  Why will our gentry flatter trade and lie  Why pack the cards andwhat d'ye call't the die  All all the pleasing paths of gain pursue  And wade thro' thick and thin as we folk do  Sweet is the scent that from advantage springs  And nothing  dirty  that good interest brings  'Tis this that cures the scandal and the smell  The reste'en let our learned  betters  tell  WIFE When goody  Dobbins  call'd me filthy bear  And nam'd the kennel and the ducking chair  With patience I cou'd hear the scolding quean  For sure 'twas dirtiness that kept me clean  Clean was my gown on Sundays tho' not fine  Nor mistress ***'s cap so white at mine  A slut in silk or kersey is the same  Nor sweetest always is the finest dame  Thus wail'd they pleasure past and present cares  While the starv'd hog join'd his complaint to theirs  To still his grunting different ways they tend  To Westgate one and one to Cottonend  HAMLET's SOLILOQUY Imitated  By the Same  TO  print  or not to  print  that is the question  Whether 'tis better in a trunk to bury  The quirks and crotchets of outrageous Fancy  Or send a wellwrote copy to the press  And by disclosing end them To print to doubt  No more and by one act to say we end  The headach and a thousand natural shocks  Of scribbling frenzy'tis a consummation  Devoutly to be wish'd To printto beam  From the same shelf with Pope in calf well bound  To sleep perchance with QuarlesAy there's the rub  For to what class a writer may be doom'd  When he hath shuffled off some paltry stuff  Must give us pause There's the respect that makes  Th' unwilling poet keep his piece nine years  For who would bear th' impatient thirst of same  The pride of conscious merit and 'bove all  The tedious importunity of friends  When as himself might his quietus make  With a bare inkhorn Who would fardles bear  To groan and sweat under a load of wit  But that the tread of steep Parnassus' hill  That undiscover'd

plain  Her mantle grave cool Evening spreads  The Sun cuts short his joyful race  The jocund hills the laughing meads  Put on a sickening dying face  Stern Winter brings his gloomy train  Each pleasing landskip fades from view  In solemn state he shuts the scene  To flow'ry fields we bid adieu  Quite stript of every beauty see  How soon fair Nature's honours fade  The flowers are fled each spreading tree  No more affords a grateful shade  Their naked branches now behold  Bleak winds pierce thro' with murmuring sound  Chill'd by the northern breezes cold  Their leafy honours strew the ground  So man who treads life's active stage  Like leaf or blossom fades away  In tender youth or riper age  Drops thus into his native clay  Alas and can we chuse but moan  To see all Nature's charms expire  Fairblooming Spring gay Summer gone  And Autumn hastening to retire  But see the tender Redbreast comes  Forsaking now the leafless grove  Hops o'er my threshold pecks my crumbs  And courts my hospitable love  Then soothes me with his plaintive tale  As Sol withdraws his friendly ray  Chearing as evening shades prevail  The soft remains of closing day  O welcome to my homely board  There unmolested shalt thou stand  Were it with choicest dainties stor'd  For thee I'd ope a liberal hand  Since thou of all the warbling throng  Who now in silence far retire  Remainst to soothe me with a song  And many a pleasing thought inspire  An EPITAPH  By the Same  IF e'er sharp sorrow from thine eyes did flow  If e'er thy bosom felt another's woe  If e'er fair beauty's charms thy heart did prove  If e'er the offspring of thy virtuous love  Bloom'd to thy wish or to thy soul was dear  This plaintive marble asks thee for a tear  For here alas too early snatch'd away  All that was lovely Death has made his prey  No more her cheeks with crimson roses vie  No more the diamond sparkles in her eye  Her breath no more its balmy sweets can boast  Alas that breath with all its sweets is lost  Pale now those lips where blushing rubies hung  And mute the charming music of her tongue  Ye virgins fair your fading charms survey  She was whate'er your tender hearts can say  To her sweet memory for ever dear  Let the green turf receive your trickling tear  To this sad place your earliest garlands bring  And deck her grave with firstlings of the Spring  Let opening roses drooping lillies tell  Like those she bloom'd and ah like these she fell  In circling wreaths let the pale ivy grow  And distant yews a sable shade bestow  Round her ye Graces constant vigils keep  And guard fair Innocence her sacred sleep  Till that bright morn shall wake the beauteous clay  To bloom and sparkle in eternal day  UT PICTURA POESIS  By Mr NOURSE late of AllSouls College Oxon  AS once the

where nature jars  For whatsoe'er the scheme of dreamers be  Their stars may differ since their lives agree  A WINTER THOUGHT  By J EARL  I  THE man whose constitution's strong  And free from vexing cares his mind  As changing seasons pass along  Can in them all fresh pleasures find  II  Not only in the teeming bud  The opening leaf and following bloom  Urg'd by the sap's ascending flood  And fruit fair knitting in its room  III  Not only when the smiling fields  In all their gaiety appear  And the perfumes their bosoms yield  On balmy wings the zephyrs bear  IV  In morning fair in evening mild  The murm'ring brook and cooling shade  Birds airy notes in consorts wild  And Philomela's serenade  V  Not only in the waving ear  And branches bending with their load  Or whilst the produce of the year  Is gathering and in safety stow'd  VI  He pleas'd in days autumnal sees  The shadowy leaf diversify'd  With various colours and the trees  Stripp'd and stand forth in naked pride  VII  Each hollow blast and hasty show'r  The rattling hail and fleecy snow  The candy'd rime and scatter'd hoar  And icicles which downward grow  VIII  The shining pavement of the flood  To which the youthful tribes resort  And game which the discover'd wood  Exposes to the fowler's sport  IX  The greens which wintry blasts defy  Thro' native strength or human care  In hedge or close arrangery  All these a source of pleasure are  X  The sun which from the northern signs  Scorch'd with unsufferable heat  Now in a milder glory shines  And every glancing ray is sweet  XI  The silver morn and each fair star  Forth to the best advantage shine  And by the richest scene prepare  For noble thoughts th' enlarged mind  XII  He when the mornings slowest rise  Can sweetly pass the nights away  In lucubration with the wise  Or conversation with the gay  XIII  And when the winter tedious grows  And length'ning days cold stronger bring  A new increasing pleasure flows  From expectation of the spring  XIV  So he whose faculties are sound  His heart upright and conscience clean  Agreeably can pass his round  Of life in ev'ry shifting scene  XV  Not only in his youthful prime  And whilst his pow'rs continue firm  But when he feels th' effect of time  And age prepares him for the worm  XVI  Grateful for every blessing past  Patient in every present ill  And on whatever ground he's plac'd  Hope does with pleasing prospects fill  XVII  And faith in heav'n's enchanting love  From whence that Sun will soon appear  Whose smiles make endless spring above  Does all his damps and darkness clear  SONG  By the Same  STELLA and Flavia every hour  Do various hearts surprize  In Stella's soul lies all her power  And Flavia's in her eyes  More boundless Flavia's conquests are  And Stella's more confin'd  All can discern a face that's fair  But few a lovely mind  Stella like Britain's monarchs reigns  O'er cultivated lands  Like eastern tyrants Flavia deigns  To rule o'er barren sands  Then boast not Flavia thy fair face  Thy beauty's only store  Thy charms will every day decrease  Each day gives Stella more  VERSES spoken at WESTMINSTER School  JF  HOW like you Sir the splendor of the day  What has your lordship not a word to say  Can neither verse nor prose your praises move  He sure dislikes who cares not to approve  You view with scorn our antiquated ways  Queen Bess's golden rules and golden days  No powder'd liveries attend us here  Hunger's our sauce and mutton is our cheer  Our wornout customs may provoke your sport  How long the graces and the meals how short  Nor can our mouldy collegelife afford  A bed more fashionable than its board  No statealcove no wainscot can you see  Of cedar old or new mahogany  To us poetic furniture is given  Curtains of night and canopy of heaven  Our youths whom wellbred gentlemen despise  Sleep with the lamb as with the lark they rise  Nay prayers each day strange things to modern beaux  Open our morning and our evening close  Nor yet content with what at home we do  Our laws present us to the public view  We to the Abbey march in white array  Thrice every week beside each holy day  What boys of rank cou'd brook such hard commands  Like meanest choristers to take their stands  Or penitents with tapers in their hands  But these objections nobles may disown  Who seldom stoop to wear the daggled gown  The school itself unmannerly they call  Like death a general leveller of all  Which ne'er regards the priv'lege of a peer  What race you spring from or what arms you bear  Boys on themselves not ancestors relie  Distinguish'd by intrinsic quality  A saucy commoner may take  his  place  Who is a lord and is to be his grace  Not so at homethere due distinction's made  And full obeisance to degree is paid  Far milder treatment does his honour meet  From handmaid gentle and from sister sweet  With footmen romps which finely must improve him  And kiss his cousins that his aunts may love him  There the whole kindred join to form an heir  And uncles grandsires grandmothers are there  But oh th' enchanting blessings who can shew  Which from the kennel and the stable flow  When honour quits the closet for the fields  And all the student to the sportsman yields  Perhaps some glorious huntingmatch design'd  E'en now tho' absent rises to your mind  If not prevented by this luckless day  How had you scower'd o'er hills and dales away  By foxes murder'd glory to obtain  And boast three vixens in a fortnight slain  Or had the generous stag with winged speed  Across whole countries urg'd the straining steed  Each Yorkshire Riding might have view'd the race  Your horn perhaps had rung thro' ChevyChace  More cou'd I say  LORD C  But hold 'tis time you end  Who for a renegade mistake a friend  And cou'd you think one son so void of grace  T' abjure his Alma Mater to her face  How shou'd not she with irony dispense  Who lends us figures to adorn our sense  Why 'tis to gain her smiles our parts we prove  To shew our genius is to shew our love  And you the judges since yourselves inspire  Or our pacific or prolific fire  Be candid and absolve the general aim  We argue different but we think the same  Parents when fondness or the fashion sway  Will breed their child themselves the modern way  No pedant schemes that abject minds controul  Shou'd thwart the native freedom of his soul  Him their own eye o'erlooks own modes resine  And master's powder'd ev'ry day to dine  As for his pretty head mamma takes care  The comb's well fix'd and nicely curl'd the hair  And not one thing I'll warrant you breeds there  E'en let the dirty boys so doom'd be fools  And walk thro' thick and thin to crowded schools  Lest such rude noise shou'd hurt his tender brain  In his own hall Sir Timothy they train  Moll tells him stories while she sweeps the room  And he imbibes his morals from the groom  At twelve years old the sprightly youth is able  To turn a pancake or dryrub a table  Soon as the clerk has taught him all he can  They send to London for some abler man  Down comes a Frenchman Sire me swear and vow  Me be surpriz'd you make no better bow  But will make you un brave scholar no fear  Better den my own self in two tree year  The knight begins and in a literal sense  Turns French to English and makes Latin French  Three years my lady mother has the joy  To hear the Frenchman and to see the boy  To her it is a comfort above all  That Tim should learn so fast and grow so tall  Kitty my lady's waiting maid was sister  To Tom the groom who knew the knight had kiss'd her  Tom manages his knight at such a rate  He beats the Frenchman and he marries Kate  So fondly the wise mother lov'd the child  She quite undid him lest he shou'd be spoil'd  This news the widow of the neighb'ring grange  Heard with surprizeBut I said she will change  This unsuccessful method and my Jerry  I'll answer for't shall never thus miscarry  Prate with the maid Nohim I'll breed up shyly  And every servant shall respect him highly  No trifling monsieur here shall give advice  I'll have some seniorfellow grave and wise  From either of our universities  She said'Tis doneThe honest man with pains  Gender and number mood and tense explains  Jerry goes thro' his daily task and thrives  From  in speech be  to th'  appletree  arrives  Then studious reads what Belgian authors writ  And drains whole nomenclators for their wit  From thence apace he grows accomplish'd fully  Has read Corderius and has heard of Tully  Shou'd Oxford next or Paris be his chance  The last prevails and he's equip'd for France  He goessees every thing that rare and new is  And hunts like any alderman with Lewis  Till some great fortune or mamma's command  Again restores him to the British strand  Then welcome Sir to bless your native land  But see the proper vacancy present  And up he comes full fraught with parliament  Then first his noble heart begins to sink  Fain would he speak but knows not how to think  Howe'er he'll needs launch out beyond his reach  For who ne'er made a theme makes no good speech  Hence the loud laugh and scornful sneer arise  Hence round and round the piquant raill'ry flies  And thus sad shame tho' now he's twentyfour  He's finely lash'd that ne'er was lash'd before  While each mean time or commoner or peer  Who pass'd the discipline in practice here  Convinc'd applauds the doctor's wholsome plan  Who made the youngster smart to save the man  For what tho' some the good old man desert  Grow learn'd with ease and grasp the shade of art  For us we foster here no vain pretence  Nor fill with empty pride the void of sense  We rise with pains nor think the labour light  To speak like Romans and like Romans write  'Tis ours to court care the learned throng  To catch their spirit as we gain their tongue  To enjoy the charms in Caesar's works that shine  And learn to glow at Virgil's lofty line  'Twas thus you mov'd and thus in riper years  With such superior lustre fill your spheres  'Twas thus you learn'd to rise nor can you blame  If as we tread your steps we hope your fame  And oh may Westminster for ever view  Sons after sons succeed and all like you  May every doubt your great examples clear  And Education six her empire here  A LETTER to Sir ROBERT WALPOLE  By the late HENRY FIELDING  SIR  WHILE at the helm of state you ride  Our nation's envy and its pride  While foreign courts with wonder gaze  And justly all your counsels praise  Which in contempt of faction's force  Steer tho' oppos'd a steady course  Wou'd you not wonder Sir to view  Your bard a greater man than you  And yet the sequel proves it true  You know Sir certain ancient fellows  Philosophers and others tell us  That no alliance e'er between  Greatness and happiness is seen  If so may heaven still deny  To you to be as great as I  Besides we 're taught it does behove us  To think those better who 're above us  Another instance of my glory  Who live above you twice two story  And from my garret can look down  As from an hill on half the town  Greatness by poets still is painted  With many followers acquainted  This too does in my favour speak  Your levée is but twice a week  From mine I can exclude but one day  My door is quiet on a Sunday  The distance too at which they bow  Does my superior greatness shew  Familiar you to admiration  May be approach'd by all the nation  While I like Great Mogul in Indo  Am never seen but at a window  The family that dines the latest  Is in our street esteem'd the greatest  But greater him we surely call  Who hardly deigns to dine at all  If with my greatness you're offended  The fault is easily amended  You have it Sir within your power  To take your humble servant lower  An EPISTLE from the Elector of BAVARIA to the FRENCH King after the Battle of RAMILLIES  IF yet great Sir your heart can comfort know  And the returning sighs less frequent flow  If yet your ear can suffer ANNA's fame  And bear without a start her MARLBRO's name  If half the slain o'er wide  Ramillia  spread  Are yet forgot and in your fancy dead  Attend and be yourself while I recite  Oh that I only can of losses wrire  To what a mighty sum our ills amount  And give a faithful tho' a sad account  Let not  Bavaria  be condemn'd unheard  Nor 'till examin'd have his conduct clear'd  Charge not on me alone that fatal day  Your own commanders bore too great a sway  Think Sir with pity think what I have lost  My native realms and my paternal coast  All that a firm confed'rate could bestow  Ev'n faith and fame if you believe the foe  Think what a heavy load o'erwhelms my breast  With its own sorrows and with yours opprest  After one battle lost and country gone  Vanquish'd again alas and twice undone  Oh where shall I begin what language find  To heal the raging anguish of your mind  Or if you deign a willing ear to lend  Oh where will my disastrous story end  Conquest I often promis'd I confess  And who from such a pow'r could promise less  There  Gallia  's force and here  Bavaria  's shines  Th' experienc'd houshold fills our crowded lines  Already had our tow'ring thoughts o'erthrown  The  Belgian  host while we survey'd our own  Destroy'd their provinces with sword and flame  Let in their seas and sack'd their  Amsterdam  Already had we shar'd the fancy'd spoil  Imaginary trophies crown'd our toil  Batavian  standards at this temple gave  In that the  British  crosses doom'd to wave  A rural seat assign'd each captive chief  In flow'ry gardens to assuage his grief  And by his arts and first escape prepar'd  On MARLBRO had bestow'd a double guard  Paris  impatient for the conquer'd foe  Hasten'd the tuneful hymn and solemn show  Triumphal chariots for the victor stay'd  And finish'd arches cast a pompous shade  With nicest art the bards had dress'd their lays  Of nothing fearful but to reach our praise  But all our hopes and expectation crost  What lines have we what fame has  Boileau  lost  Your army now fixt on its high designs  Rush forth like vernal swarms and quit their lines  Eager the  Dyle  they pass to seek the fight  Judoina  's fields with sudden tents are white  The foe descends like torrents from the hills  And all the neighb'ring vale tumultuous fills  Preluding cannons tell th' approaching storm  And working armies take a dreadful form  Soon your victorious arms and stronger force  Tore all the left and broke the  Belgian  horse  Their scatter'd troops are rally'd to the fight  But only rally'd for a second flight  As when high heav'n on some aspiring wood  Which in close ranks and thickest order stood  Pours its collected stores of vengeance down  Cedars are seen with firs and oaks o'erthrown  Long ravages and intervals of waste  So gor'd their lines appear'd and so defac'd  The third attack had ended all the war  Sunk their whole force and sav'd your future care  Had MARLBRO only MARLBRO not been there  As some good genius flies to save the realms  Which in his absence born a plague o'erwhelms  Through op'ning squadrons did the hero haste  And rais'd their drooping courage as he past  Amidst the routed  Belgians  he arriv'd  Turn'd the pursuit the fainting fight reviv'd  Supply'd each rank fill'd ev'ry vacant space  And brought the battle to its former face  With trembling hearts we see our fate decreed  Where MARLBRO fights how can a foe succeed  To reach his life our boldest warriors strive  On him the storm with all its thunder drive  He stems the war and half encompass'd round  Still clears his way and still maintains his ground  Amaz'd I saw him in such dangers live  And envy'd him the death I wish'd to give  But how our rising pleasure shall I tell  The thund'ring steed and the great rider fell  We thank'd kind heav'n and hop'd the victor slain  But all our hopes and all our thanks were vain  Free from the guilt of any hostile wound  Alive he lay and dreadful on the ground  As when a lion in the toils is cast  That uncontroul'd had laid the country waste  Th' insulting hinds surround him who before  Fled from his haunts and trembled at his roar  So round beset the mighty  Briton  lies  And vulgar foes attempt the glorious prize  'Till fresh battalions to his succour brought  Contending armies for the hero fought  The wanted steed some friendly hand prepar'd  And met a satal but a great reward  A glorious death of his lov'd lord bereft  The pious office unperform'd he left  The rescu'd chief by the past danger warm'd  Our weaken'd  houshold  with new fury storm'd  While all around to our admiring eyes  Fresh foes and undiscover'd squadrons rise  The boasted guards that spread your name so far  And turn'd wheree'er they fought the doubtful war  With heaps of slaughter strow'd the fatal plain  And did a thousand glorious things in vain  Broke with unequal force such numbers die  That I my self rejoic'd to see them sly  But oh how few preserv'd themselves by flight  Or found a shelter from th' approaching night  Thousands fall undistinguish'd in the dark  And five whole leagues with wide destruction mark  Scarce at  Ramillia  did the slaughter end  When the swift victor had approach'd  Ostend  Took in whole states and countries in his way  Brussels  nor  Ghent  nor  Antwerp  gain'd a day  Within the compass of one circling moon  The  Lis  the  Demer  and the  Scheld  his own  What in the foe's and what in  William  's hand  Did for an age the power of  France  withstand  Tho' each campaign she crowded nations drain'd  And the fat soil with blood of thousands stain'd  Those forts and provinces does MARLBRO gain  In twice three suns and not a soldier slain  None can suspend the fortune of their town  But who their harvest and their country drown  Compell'd to call his valour to evade  The less destructive ocean to their aid  Oh were our loss to  Flandria  's plains confin'd  But what a train of ills are still behind  Beyond the  Adige Vendome  feels the blow  And  Villars  now retires without a foe  The fate of  Flanders  spreads in  Spain  the flame  And their new monarch robs of half his fame  But  France  shall hear in some late distant reign  An unborn  Lewis  curse  Ramillia  's plain  Whither oh whither shall  Bavaria  run  Or where himself or where the victor shun  Shall I no more with vain ambition roam  But my own subjects rule in peace at home  Thence an abandon'd fugitive I'm driv'n  Like the first guilty man by angry heav'n  From his bless'd mansions where th' avenging lord  Still guards the passage with a brandish'd sword  Or shall I to  Brabantia  's courts retire  And reign o'er distant provinces for hire  Shall I with borrow'd government dispense  A royal servant and another's prince  These countries too oh my hard fate are lost  And I am banish'd from a foreign coast  Now may I fight secure of future toils  Of no new countries a third battle spoils  Oh  Tallard  once I did thy chains deplore  But envy now the fate I mourn'd before  By bondage bless'd protected by the foe  You live contented with one overthrow  Her captive  Britain  kindly kept away  From the disgrace of the last fatal day  How does my fall the haughty victor raise  And join divided nations in his praise  Grateful  Germania  unknown titles frames  And CHURCHILL writes amongst her sov'reign names  Part of her states obey a  British  lord  Small part of the great empire he restor'd  From the proud  Spaniard  he extorts applause  And rivals with the  Dutch  their great  Nassaus  In ev'ry language are his battles known  The  Swede  and  Pole  for his despise their own  A thousand sects in him their safety place  And our own saints are thank'd for our disgrace  England  alone and that some pleasure gives  Envies herself the blessings she receives  My grief each place renews wheree'er I go  And ev'ry art contributes to my woe  Ramillia  's plain each painter's pencil yields  Bavaria  flies in all their canvas fields  On me young poets their rude lays indite  And on my sorrows practise how to write  I in their scenes with borrow'd passion rage  And act a shameful part on ev'ry stage  In  Flandria  will the tale be ever told  Nor will it grow with ever telling old  The lisping infants will their MARLBRO raise  And their new speech grow plainer in his praise  His story will employ their middle years  And in their latest age recall their fears  While to their children's children they relate  The business of a day their country's fate  Then lead them forth their thoughts to entertain  And shew the wond'ring youth  Ramillia  's plain  'Twas here they fought the  houshold  fled that way  And this the spot where MARLBRO prostrate lay  Here they perhaps shall add  Bavaria  's name  Censure his courage and his conduct blame  'Tis false 'tis false I did not basely yield  I left indeed but left a bloody field  Believe not future ages ne'er believe  The vile aspersions which these wretches give  If you too far my injur'd honour try  Take heed my ghost it will it shall be nigh  Rise in his face and give the slave the lie  Why should the stars thus on  Britannia  smile  And partial blessings crown the fav'rite isle  Holland  does her for their great founder own  Britannia  gave to  Portugal  a crown  Twice by her queens does proud  Iberia  fall  Her  Edwards  and her  Henrys  conquer'd  Gaul  The  Swede  her arms from late oppression freed  And if he dares oppress will curb the  Swede  She from herself decides her neighbours fates  Rescues by turns by turns subdues their states  In the wide globe no part could nature stretch  Beyond her arms and out of  Britain  's reach  Who fear'd she e'er could have  Bavaria  seen  Such realms and kingdoms hills and seas between  Yet thereoh sad remembrance of my woe  Distant  Bavaria  does her triumphs show  Proud state must  Europe  lie at thy command  No prince without thee rise without thee stand  What share what part is thine of all the spoil  Thine only is the hazard and the toil  An empire thou hast sav'd and all its states  Iberia  's realms have felt severer fates  What wou'dst thou more still do thy arms advance  Heav'n knows what doom thou hast reserv'd for  France  From whose wise care does all the treasure rise  That slaughter'd hosts and shatter'd fleets supplies  From whence such boundless conquest does she reap  Purchas'd with all her boasted millions cheap  O bless'd oh envy'd QUEEN that does command  At such a time in such a happy land  Great in her armies and her pow'rful fleet  Great in her treasures in her triumphs great  But greater still and what we envy most  That can a MARLBRO for her subject boast  Oh  Gallia  from what splendors art thou hurl'd  The terror once of all the western world  Thy spreading map each year did larger grow  New mountains still did rise new rivers flow  But now surrounded by thy ancient mounds  Dost inward shrink from thy newconquer'd bounds  Why did not nature far from MARLBRO's worth  In distant ages bring her  Louis  forth  Each uncontroul'd had conquer'd worlds alone  Happy for  Europe  they together shone  Cease  Louis  cease from wars and slaughter cease  Oh sue at last 'tis time to sue for peace  Urge nor too far your twice unhappy fate  Nor MARLBRO's stronger arm confess too late  Who never camps or rough encounters saw  Can no just image of the hero draw  He must alas that MARLBRO truly knows  Face him in battle and whole armies lose  Believe me Sir on my unwilling breast  Fate has his virtues one by one imprest  With what a force our  Schellemberg  he storm'd  And  Bleinheim  's battle with what conduct form'd  How great his vigilance how quick his thought  What his contempt of death  Ramillia  taught  These nature cool for peace and counsel forms  For battle those with rage and fury warms  But to her fav'rite  Britain  does impart  The coolest head at once and warmest heart  So does  Sicilia  's lofty mountains show  Flames in her bosom on her head the snow  My youth with flatt'ring smiles did Fortune crown  The more severely on my age to frown  Of Pleasure's endless flores I drank my fill  Officious Nature waited on my will  The  Austrian  rescu'd and the  Turk  o'erthrown  Europe  and  Asia  fill'd with my renown  Blasted are all my glories and my fame  Lost is my country and illustrious name  The titles from their present lord are torn  Which my great ancestors so long had borne  No native honours shall my offspring grace  The last elector with a num'rous race  Half my unhappy subjects lost by wars  The rest for a worse fate the victor spares  Were they for this entrusted to my care  This the reward the brave the faithful share  My sons lament in distant dungeons thrown  Unacted crimes and follies not their own  But oh my consortmy o'erflowing eyes  Gush forth with tears and all my sorrows rise  While the dear tender exile I bemoan  Oh royal bride oh daughter of a throne  Not thus I promis'd when I sought thy bed  Thou didst the brave the great  Bavaria  wed  Curst be ambition curst the thirst of pow'r  And curst that oncelov'd title Emperor  Excuse great Sir the ravings of a mind  That can so just a cause for sorrow find  My words too rudely may a monarch greet  For oh was ever grief like mine discreet  No suff'rings shall my firm alliance end  An unsuccessful but a faithful friend  To the DUKE of MARLBOROUGH  PARDON great Duke if  Britain  's stile delights  Or if th' Imperial title more invites  Pardon great Prince the sailings of a Muse  That dares not hope for more than your excuse  Forc'd at a distance to attempt your praise  And sing your victories in mournful lays  To cast in shadows and allay the light  That wounds with nearer rays the dazled sight  Nor durst in a direct and open strain  Such acts with her unhallow'd notes prophane  In tow'ring verse let meaner heroes grow  And to elab'rate lines their greatness owe  Your actions own'd by ev'ry nation want  Praises no greater than a foe may grant  Oh when shall  Europe  by her MARLBRO's sword  To lasting peace and liberty restor'd  Allow her weary champion a retreat  To his lov'd country and his rising seat  Where your soft partner far from martial noise  Your cares shall sweeten with domestic joys  Your conquests she with doubtful pleasure hears  And in the midst of ev'ry triumph fears  Betwixt her queen and you divides her life  A friend obsequious and a faithful wife  Hail  Woodstock  hail ye celebrated glades  Grow fast ye woods and flourish thick ye shades  Ye rising tow'rs for your new lord prepare  Like your old  Henry  come from  Gallia  's war  The gen'ral's arms as far the king's o'erpow'r  As this new structure does surpass the bow'r  The pleasing prospects and romantic scite  The spacious compass and the stately height  The painted gardens in their flow'ry prime  Demand whole volumes of immortal rhime  And if the Muse would second the design  Mean as they are should in my numbers shine  There live the joy and wonder of our isles  Happy in  Albion  's love and ANNA's smiles  While from the godlike race of CHURCHILL born  Four beauteous  Rosamonds  this bow'r adorn  Who with the ancient syren of the place  In charms might vie and ev'ry blooming grace  But bless'd with equal virtues had she been  Like them she had been favour'd by the QUEEN  Whom your high merit and their own prefers  To all the worthiest beds of  England  's peers  Thus the great eagle when heav'n's wars are o'er  And the loud thunder has forgot to roar  Jove  's fires laid by with those of  Venus  burns  To his forsaken mate and shades returns  On some proud tree more sacred than the rest  With curious art he builds his spacious nest  In the warm sun lies basking all the day  While round their sire the gen'rous eaglets play  Their sire wellpleas'd to see the noble brood  Fill all the loftiest cedars of the wood  An ODE on Miss HARRIET HANBURY at Six Years old  By Sir CHARLES HANBURY WILLIAMS  I  WHY shou'd I thus employ my time  To paint those cheeks of rosy hue  Why shou'd I search my brains for rhyme  To sing those eyes of glossy blue  II  The pow'r as yet is all in vain  Thy num'rous charms and various graces  They only serve to banish pain  And light up joy in parents' faces  III  But soon those eyes their strength shall feel  Those charms their pow'rful sway shall find  Youth shall in crowds before you kneel  And own your empire o'er mankind  IV  Then when on Beauty's throne you fit  And thousands court your wish'dfor arms  My Muse shall stretch her utmost wit  To sing the victories of your charms  V  Charms that in time shall ne'er be lost  At least while verse like mine endures  And future HANBURYS shall boast  Of verse like mine of charms like yours  VI  A little vain we both may be  Since scarce another house can shew  A poet that can sing like me  A beauty that can charm like you  A SONG Upon Miss HARRIET HANBURY address'd to the Rev Mr BIRT  By the Same  I  DEAR doctor of St Mary's  In the hundred of Bergavenny  I've seen such a lass  With a shape and a face  As never was match'd by any  II  Such wit such bloom and such beauty  Has this girl of Ponty Pool Sir  With eyes that wou'd make  The toughest heart ach  And the wisest man a fool Sir  III  At our fair t'other day she appear'd Sir  And the Welchmen all flock'd and view'd her  And all of them said  She was fit to have been made  A wise for Owen Tudor  IV  They wou'd ne'er have been tir'd with gazing  And so much her charms did please Sir  That all of them staid  Till their ale grew dead  And cold was their toasted cheese Sir  V  How happy the lord of the manor  That shall be of her possest Sir  For all must agree  Who my HARRIET shall see  She's HARRIET of the best Sir  VI  Then pray make a ballad about her  We know you have wit if you'd shew it  Then don't be asham'd  You can never be blam'd  For a prophet is often a poet  VII  But why don't you make one yourself then  I suppose I by you shall be told Sir  This beautiful piece  Alas is my niece  And besides she's but five years old Sir  VIII  But tho' my dear friend she's no older  In her face it may plainly be seen Sir  That this angel at five  Will if she's alive  Be a goddess at fifteen Sir  To Mr GARNIER and Mr PEARCE of BATH A grateful ODE in return for the extraordinary Kindness and Humanity they shewed to me and my eldest Daughter now Lady ESSEX  By the Same  I  WHAT glorious verse from Love has sprung  How well has Indignation sung  And can the gentle Muse  Whilst in her once belov'd abode  I stray and suppliant kneel an ode  To Gratitude refuse  II  GARNIER my friend accept this verse  And thou receive wellnatur'd PEARCE  All I can give of fame  Let others other subjects sing  Some murd'rous chief some tyrant king  Humanity's my theme  III  Whilst arts like yours employ'd by you  Make verse in such a theme your due  To whom indulgent Heav'n  Its fav'rite pow'r of doing good  By you so rightly understood  Judiciously has giv'n  IV  Behold obedient to your pow'r  Consuming fevers rage no more  Nor chilling agues freeze  The cripple dances void of pain  The deaf in raptures hear again  The blind transported sees  V  Health at your call extends her wing  Each healing plant each friendly spring  Its various pow'r discloses  O'er Death's approaches you prevail  See Chloe's cheek of late so pale  Blooms with returning roses  VI  These gifts my friends which shine in you  Are rare yet to some chosen few  Heav'n has the same assign'd  Health waits on Mead's prescription still  And Hawkins' hand and Ranby's skill  Are blessings to mankind  VI  But hearts like yours are rare indeed  Which for another's wounds can bleed  Another's grief can feel  The lover's fear the parent's groan  Your natures catch and make your own  And share the pains you heal  VIII  But why to them Hygeia why  Dost thou thy cordial drop deny  Who but for others live  Oh goddess hear my pray'r and grant  That these that health may never want  Which they to others give  ODE to DEATH Translated from the FRENCH of the King of PRUSSIA  By Dr HAWKSWORTH  YET a few  years  or  days  perhaps  Or  moments  pass with silent lapse  And time to me shall be no more  No more the sun these eyes shall view  Earth o'er these limbs her dust shall strew  And life's fantastic dream be o'er  Alas I touch the dreadful brink  From nature's verge impell'd I sink  And endless darkness wraps me round  Yes Death is ever at my hand  Fast by my bed he takes his stand  And constant at my board is found  Earth air and fire and water join  Against this fleeting life of mine  And where for succour can I fly  If art with flatt'ring wiles pretend  To shield me like a guardian friend  By Art ere Nature bids I die  I see this tyrant of the mind  This idol Flesh to dust consign'd  Once call'd from dust by pow'r divine  Its features change 'tis pale 'tis cold  Hence dreadful spectre to behold  Thy aspect is to make it mine  And can I then with guilty pride  Which fear nor shame can quell or hide  This flesh still pamper and adorn  Thus viewing what I soon  shall be  Can what I  am  demand the knee  Or look on aught around with scorn  But then this spark that warms that guides  That lives that thinks what fate betides  Can this be dust a kneaded clod  This yield to death the soul the mind  That measures heav'n and mounts the wind  That knows at once itself and God  Great Cause of all above below  Who knows thee must for ever know  Immortal and divine  Thy image on my soul imprest  Of endless being is the test  And bids Eternity be mine  Transporting thoughtbut am I sure  That endless life will joy secure  Joy's only to the just decreed  The guilty wretch expiring goes  Where vengeance endless life bestows  That endless mis'ry may succeed  Great God how aweful is the scene  A breath a transient breath between  And can I jest and laugh and play  To earth alas too firmly bound  Trees deeply rooted in the ground  Are shiver'd when they're torn away  Vain joys which envy'd greatness gains  How do ye bind with silken chains  Which ask  Herculean  strength to break  How with new terrors have ye arm'd  The pow'r whose slightest glance alarm'd  How many deaths of one ye make  Yet dumb with wonder I behold  Man's thoughtless race in error bold  Forget or scorn the  laws  of death  With  these  no projects coincide  Nor vows nor toils nor hopes  they  guide  Each thinks he draws immortal breath  Each blind to fate's approaching hour  Intrigues or fights for wealth or pow'r  And slumb'ring dangers dare provoke  And he who tott'ring scarce sustains  A century's age plans future gains  And feels an unexpected stroke  Go on unbridled desp'rate band  Scorn rocks gulphs winds search sea and land  And spoil new worlds wherever found  Seize haste to seize the glitt'ring prize  And sighs and tears and pray'rs despise  Nor spare the temple's holy ground  They go succeed but look again  The desp'rate hand you seek in vain  Now trod in dust the peasant's scorn  But who that saw their treasures swell  That heard th' insatiate vow rebel  Would e'er have thought them mortal born  See the world's victor mount his car  Blood marks his progress wide and far  Sure he shall reign while ages fly  No vanish'd like a morning cloud  The hero was but just allow'd  To fight to conquer and to die  And is it true I ask with dread  That nations heap'd on nations bled  Beneath his chariot's fervid wheel  With trophies to adorn the spot  Where his pale corse was left to rot  And doom'd the hungry reptile's meal  Yes Fortune weary'd with her play  Her toy this hero casts away  And scarce the form of man is seen  Awe chills my breast my eyes o'erflow  Around my brows no roses glow  The cypress mine funereal green  Yet in this hour of grief and fears  When aweful Truth unveil'd appears  Some pow'r unknown usurps my breast  Back to the world my thoughts are led  My feet in Folly's lab'rynth tread  And fancy dreams that life is blest  How weak an empress is the mind  Whom Pleasure's flow'ry wreaths can bind  And captive to her altars lead  Weak Reason yields to Phrenzy's rage  And all the world is Folly's stage  And all that act are fools indeed  And yet this strange this sudden flight  From gloomy cares to gay delight  This fickleness so light and vain  In life's delusive transient dream  Where men nor things are what they seem  Is all the real good we gain  The Hymns of DIONYSIUS Tran∣slated from the Greek  By the Rev Mr MERRICK  To the MUSE  LEND thy voice celestial maid  Through thy vocal grove convey'd  Let a sudden call from thee  Wake my soul to harmony  Raise oh raise the hallow'd strain  Mistress of the tuneful train  And thou sacred source of light  Author of our mystic rite  Thou whom erst Latona bore  On the seagirt Delian shore  Join the fav'ring Muse and shed  All thy influence on my head  II TO APOLLO  Be still ye vaulted skies be still  Each hollow vale each echoing hill  Let earth and seas and winds attend  Ye birds awhile your notes suspend  Be hush'd each sound behold him nigh  Parent of sacred harmony  He comes his unshorn hair behind  Loose floating to the wanton wind  Hail sire of day whose rosy car  Through the pathless fields of air  By thy winged coursers borne  Opes the eyelids of the morn  Thou whose locks their light display  O'er the wide aetherial way  Wreathing their united rays  Into one promiscuous blaze  Under thy allseeing eye  Earth's remotest corners lie  While in thy repeated course  Issuing from thy fruitful source  Floods of fire incessant stray  Streams of everlasting day  Round thy sphere the starry throng  Varying sweet their ceaseless song  While their vivid flames on high  Deck the clear untroubled sky  To the tuneful lyre advance  Joining in the mystic dance  And with step alternate beat  Old Olympus' lofty seat  At their head the wakeful Moon  Drives her milkwhite heifers on  And with measur'd pace and even  Glides around the vast of heaven  Journeying with unwearied force  And rejoicing in her course  Time attends with swift career  And forms the circle of the year  III To NEMESIS  Nemesis whose dreaded weight  Turns the scale of human fate  On whose front black terrors dwell  Daughter dire of Justice hail  Thou whose adamantine rein  Curbs the arrogant and vain  Wrong and Force before thee die  Envy shuns thy searching eye  And her sable wings outspread  Flies to hide her hated head  Where thy wheel with restless round  Runs along th' unprinted ground  Humbled there at thy decree  Human greatness bows the knee  Thine it is unseen to trace  Step by step each mortal's pace  Thine the sons of Pride to check  And to bend the stubborn neck  Till our lives directed stand  By the measure in thy hand  Thou observant sit'st on high  With bent brow and stedfast eye  Weighing all that meets thy view  In thy balance just and true  Goddess look propitious down  View us but without a frown  Nemesis whose dreaded weight  Turns the scale of human fate  Nemesis be still our theme  Power immortal and supreme  Thee we praise nor thee alone  But add the partner of thy throne  Thee and Justice both we sing  Justice whose unwearied wing  Rears aloft the virtuous name  Safe from hell's rapacious claim  And when thou thy wrath hast shed  Turns it from the guiltless head  A SATIRE in the Manner of PERSIUS in a Dialogue between ATTICUS and EUGENIO  By the late Lord HERVEY  ATTICUS  WHY wears my pensive friend that gloomy brow  Say whence proceeds th' imaginary woe  What prosp'rous villain hast thou met today  Or hath afflicted Virtue cross'd thy way  Is it some crime unpunish'd you deplore  Or right subverted by injurious Power  Be this or that the cause 'tis wisely done  To make the sorrows of mankind your own  To see the injur'd pleading unredress'd  The proud exalted and the meek oppress'd  Can hurt thy health and rob thee of thy rest  Your cares are in a hopeful way to cease  If you must find perfection to find peace  But reck thy malice vent thy stifled rage  Inveigh against the times and lash the age  Perhaps just recent from the court you come  O'er public ills to ruminate at home  Say which of all the wretches thou hast seen  Hath thrown a morsel to thy hungry spleen  What worthless member of that medley throng  Who basely acts or tamely suffers wrong  He who to nothing but his inter'st true  Cajoles the fool he's working to undo  Or that more despicable timorous slave  Who knows himself abus'd yet hugs the knave  Perhaps you mourn our senate's sinking fame  That shew of freedom dwindled to a name  Where hireling judges deal their venal laws  And the best bidder hath the justest cause  What then  They have the pow'r and who shall dare to blame  The legal wrong that bears Astraea's name  Besides such thoughts shou'd never stir the rage  Of youthful gallreflection comes with age  'Tis our decaying life's autumnal fruit  The bitter produce of our latest shoot  When ev'ry blossom of the tree is dead  Enjoyment wither'd and our wishes fled  Thine still is in its spring on ev'ry bough  Fair Plenty blooms and youthful Odours blow  Season of joy too early to be wise  The time to covet pleasures not despise  Yours is an age when trifles ought to please  Too soon for reason to attack thy ease  Tho' soon the hour shall come when thou shalt know  'Tis vain fruition all and empty shew  But late examine late inspect mankind  If seeing pains 'tis prudence to be blind  Let not their vices yet employ thy thoughts  Laugh at their follies ere you weep their faults  And when as sure you must at length you find  What things men are resolve to arm your mind  Too nicely never their demerits scan  And of their virtues make the most you can  Silent avert the mischief they intend  And cross but seem not to discern their end  If they prevail submit for prudence lies  In suffering well'Tis equally unwise  To see the injuries we won't resent  And mourn the evils which we can't prevent  EUGENIO  You counsel well to bid me arm my mind  Wou'd the receipt were easy as 'tis kind  But hard it is for misery to reach  That fortitude prosperity can teach  Cou'd I forbid what has been to have been  Or lodge a doubt on truths myself have seen  Cou'd I divest remembrance of her store  And say collect these images no more  Cou'd I dislodge sensation from my breast  And charm her wakeful faculties to rest  Cou'd I my nature and myself subdue  I might the method you prescribe pursue  But if unfeign'd afflictions we endure  If reason's our disease and not our cure  Then seeming ease is all we can obtain  As one who long familiariz'd to pain  Still feels the smart but ceases to complain  Tho' young in life yet long inur'd to care  Thus I submissive every evil bear  If unexpected ills alone are hard  Mine shou'd be light who am for all prepar'd  No disappointments can my peace annoy  Disuse has wean'd me from all hopes of joy  The vain pursuit for ever I give o'er  Repuls'd I strive betray'd I trust no more  Mankind I know their nature and their art  Their vice their own their virtue but a part  Ill play'd so oft that all the cheat can tell  And dang'rous only where 'tis acted well  In different classes rang'd a different name  Attends their practice but the heart's the same  Their hate is interest interest too their love  On the same springs these different engines move  That sharpens malice and directs her sting  And thence the honey'd streams of flattery spring  Long I suspected what at last I know  I thought men worthless now I've prov'd 'em so  Reluctant prov'd it by too sure a rule  I learn'd my science in a painful school  He buys e'en wisdom at too dear a price  Who pays my sad experience to be wise  Why did I hope by sanguine views possess'd  That Virtue harbour'd in a human breast  Why did I trust to Flattery's specious wile  The April sunshine of her transient smile  Why disbelieve the lessons of the wise  That taught me young to pierce her thin disguise  I thought their rancour not their prudence spoke  That age perverse in false invectives broke  I thought their comments on this gaudy scene  The effects of phlegm and dictated by spleen  That jealous of the joys themselves were past  Their envy try'd to pall their children's taste  Like the deaf adder to the charmer's tongue  I gave no credit to the truths they sung  But happy in a visionary scheme  Still sought companions worthy my esteem  The tongue the heart's interpreter I deem'd  And judg'd of what men were by what they seem'd  I thought each warm professor meant me fair  Each supple sycophant a friend sincere  The solemn hypocrite whose close design  Mirth never interrupts nor love nor wine  Who talks on any secret but his own  Collecting all communicating none  Who still attentive to what others say  Observes to wound or questions to betray  Of him as guardian of my private thought  In morning counsels cool resolves I sought  To him still open cautiously consign'd  The inmost treasures of my secret mind  My joys and griefs delighted to impart  In sacred confidence unmix'd with art  That dangerous pleasure of the honest heart  Whene'er I purpos'd to unbend my soul  In social banquets where the circling bowl  To gladness lifts all sorrows but despair  And gives a transient Lethe to our care  I chose the men whose talents entertain  And season converse with a lively strain  Who thoughtless still by hope nor fear perplex'd  Enjoy the present hour and risque the next  These not the luxury of slothful ease  Soft downy beds nor balmy slumbers please  While wakeful kings on purple couches own  The secret sorrows of their envy'd crown  And wait revolving light with shorter rest  Than e'en those wretches by their power opprest  This jocund train devoted to delight  In chearful vigils still protract the night  Nor dread the cares approaching with the day  Thro' each vicissitude for ever gay  With such I commun'd pleas'd that I cou'd find  Recess so grateful to the active mind  And while the youths in sprightly contest try  With humorous tale or apposite reply  Or amorous song or inoffensive jest  The test of wit to glad the lengthen'd feast  My soul said I depend upon their truth  For fraud inhabits not the breast of youth  Indulge thy genius here be free be safe  Mirth is their aim they covet but to laugh  Pure from deceit as ignorant of care  Their friendship and their joys are both sincere  I judg'd their nature like their humour good  As if the soul depended on the blood  And that the seeds of honesty must grow  Wherever health resides or spirits flow  I see my error but I see too late  'Tis vain inspection to look back on Fate  What are the men who most esteem'd we find  But such whose vices are the most refin'd  Blind preference for vice like poison shews  The surest death is in the subtlest dose  To such reflections when I turn my mind  I loath my being and abhor mankind  What joy for truth what commerce for the just  If all our safety's founded on distrust  If all our wisdom is a mean deceit  And he who prospers but the ablest cheat  ATTICUS  O early wise how well hast thou defin'd  The worth the joys the friendship of mankind  EUGENIO  Blest be the pow'rs I know their abject state  ATTICUS  Yet bear with this and hope a better fate  Thrice happy they who view with stable eyes  The shifting scene who temp'rate firm and wise  Can bear its sorrows and its joys despise  Who look on disappointments shocks and strife  And all the consequential ills of life  Not as severities the gods impose  But easy terms indulgent Heav'n allows  To man by short probation to obtain  Immortal recompence for transient pain  Th' intent of Heav'n thus rightly understood  From every evil we extract a good  This truth divine implanted in the heart  Supports each drudging mortal thro' his part  Gives a delightful prospect to the blind  The friendless thence a constant succour find  The wretch by fraud betray'd by pow'r oppress'd  With this restorative still soothes his breast  This suffering Virtue chears this Pain beguiles  And decks Calamity herself in smiles  When Mead and Friend have ransack'd ev'ry rule  Taught in Hippocrates' and Galen's school  To quiet ills that mock the leech's art  Which opiates fail to deaden in the heart  This cordial still th' incurable sustains  He triumphs in the sharp instructive pains  Nor like a Roman hero falsely great  With impious hand anticipates his fate  But waits resign'd the slow approach of death  Till that great Power who gave demands his breath  Such are thy solid comforts love divine  Such solid comforts O my friend be thine  On this firm basis thy foundation lay  Of happiness unsubject to decay  On man no more that frail support depend  The kindest patron or the warmest friend  The warmest friend may one day prove untrue  And interest change the kindest patron's view  Hear not my friend the fondness they profess  Nor on the trial grieve to find it less  With patience each capricious change endure  Careful to merit where reward is sure  To Providence implicitly resign'd  Let this grand precept poise thy wavering mind  With partial eyes we view our own weak cause  And rashly scan her upright equal laws  For undeserv'd she ne'er inflicts a woe  Nor is her recompence unsure tho' slow  Unpunish'd none transgress deceiv'd none trust  Her rules are fixt and all her ways are just  To Mrs BINDON at BATH  By the Honourable Sir C H WILLIAMS  APOLLO of old on Britannia did smile  And Delphi forsook for the sake of this isle  Around him he lavishly scatter'd his lays  And in every wilderness planted his bays  Then Chaucer and Spenser harmonious were heard  Then Shakespear and Milton and Waller appear'd  And Dryden whose brows by Apollo were crown'd  As he sung in such strains as the God might have own'd  But now since the laurel is given of late  To Cibber to Eusden to Shadwel and Tate  Apollo hath quitted the isle he once lov'd  And his harp and his bays to Hibernia remov'd  He vows and he swears he'll inspire us no more  And has put out Pope's fires which he kindled before  And further he says  men  no longer shall boast  A science their slight and ill treatment hath lost  But that  women  alone for the future shall write  And who can resist when they doubly delight  And lest we shou'd doubt what he said to be true  Has begun by inspiring Saphira and You  Mrs BINDON's ANSWER  WHEN home I return'd from the dancing last night  And elate by your praises attempted to write  I familiarly call'd on Apollo for aid  And told him how many fine things you had said  He smil'd at my folly and gave me to know  Your wit and not mine by your writing you shew  And then says the God still to make you more vain  He hath promis'd that I shall enlighten your brain  When he knows in his heart if he speak but his mind  That no woman alive can now boast I am kind  For since Daphne to shun me grew into a laurel  With the sex I have sworn still to keep up the quarrel  I thought it all joke 'till by writing to you  I have prov'd his resentment alas but too true  Sir CHARLES's REPLY  I'LL not believe that Phoebus did not smile  Unhappily for you I know his stile  To strains like yours of old his harp he strung  And while he dictated Orinda sung  Did beauteous Daphne's scorn of proffer'd love  Against the sex his indignation move  It rather made you his peculiar care  Convinc'd from thence ye were as good as fair  As mortals who from dust receiv'd their birth  Must when they die return to native earth  So too the laurel that your brow adorns  Sprang from the fair and to the fair returns  To a LADY who sent Compliments to a CLERGYMAN upon the Ten of Hearts  YOUR compliments dear lady pray forbear  Old English services are more sincere  You send Ten Hearts the tythe is only mine  Give me but One and burn

 Behold a Grott in Delphic grove  The Graces' and the Muses' love  O might our laureat study here  How would he hail his newborn year  A temple from vain glories free  Whose goddess is Philosophy

fops to guard this silvan ark  With necklace bells in treble bark  Nor Cynics growl and fiercely paw  The mastiffs of the moral law  Come Nymph with rural honours drest  Virtue's exterior form confest  With charms untarnish'd innocence  Display and Eden shall commence  When thus you come in sober fit  And wisdom is prefer'd to wit  And looks diviner graces tell  Which don't with giggling muscles dwell  And beauty like the rayclipt sun  With bolder cye we look upon  Learning shall with obsequious mien  Tell all the wonders she has seen  Reason her logic armour quit  And proof to mild persuasion fit  Religion with free thought dispense  And cease crusading against sense  Philosophy and she embrace  And their first league again take place  And morals pure in duty bound  Nymphlike the sister chiefs surround  Nature shall smile and round this cell  The turf to your light pressure swell  And knowing beauty by her shoe  Well air its carpet from the dew  The Oak while you his umbrage deck  Lets fall his acorns in your neck  Zephyr his civil kisses gives  And plays with curls instead of leaves  Birds seeing you believe it spring  And during their vacation sing  And flow'rs lean forward from their seats  To traffic in exchange of sweets  And angels bearing wreaths descend  Preferr'd as vergers to attend  This fane whose deity intreats  The Fair to grace its upper seats  O kindly view our letter'd strife  And guard us through polemic life  From poison vehicled in praise  For satire shots but slightly graze  We claim your zeal and find within  Philosophy and you are

tempestuous air  Till gushing tears and hasty rain  Make heaven and you serene again  Our travels through the starry skies  Were first suggested by your eyes  We by the interposing fan  Learn how eclipses first began  The vast ellipse from Scarbro' home  Describes how blazing comets roam  The glowing colours of the cheek  Their origin from Phoebus speak  Our watch how Luna strays above  Feels like the care of jealous love  And all things we in science know  From your known love for riddles flow  Father forgive thus far I stray  Drawn by attraction from my way  Mark next with awe the foundress well  Who on these banks delights to dwell  You on the terrass see her plain  Move like Diana with her train  If you then sairly speak your mind  In wedlock since with Isis join'd  You'll own you never yet did see  At least in such a high degree  Greatness delighted to undress  Science a scepter'd hand caress  A queen the friends of freedom prize  A woman wise men canonize  The BEE the ANT and the SPARROW A FABLE  Address'd to PHEBE and KITTY C at Boarding School  MY dears 'tis said in days of old  That beasts cou'd talk and birds cou'd scold  But now it seems the human race  Alone engross the speaker's place  Yet lately if report be true  And much the tale relates to you  There met a Sparrow Ant and Bee  Which reason'd and convers'd as we  Who reads my page will doubtless grant  That Phe's the wise industrious Ant  And all with half an eye may see  That Kitty is the busy Bee  Here then are twobut where's the third  Go search your school you'll sind the Bird  Your school I ask your pardon fair  I'm sure you'll find no Sparrow there  Now to my taleOne summer's morn  A Bee rang'd o'er the verdant lawn  Studious to husband every hour  And make the most of ev'ry flow'r  Nimble from stalk to stalk she flies  And loads with yellow wax her thighs  With which the artist builds her comb  And keeps all tight and warm at home  Or from the cowslip's golden bells  Sucks honey to enrich her cells  Or every tempting rose pursues  Or sips the lilly's fragrant dews  Yet never robs the shining bloom  Or of its beauty or perfume  Thus she discharg'd in every way  The various duties of the day  It chanc'd a frugal Ant was near  Whose brow was wrinkled o'er by care  A great oeconomist was she  Nor less laborious than the Bee  By pensive parents often taught  What ills arise from want of thought  That poverty on sloth depends  On poverty the loss of friends  Hence every day the Ant is found  With anxious steps to tread the ground  With curious search to trace the grain  And drag the heavy load with pain  The active Bee with pleasure saw  The Ant fulfil her parents' law  Ah sisterlabourer says she  How very fortunate are we  Who taught in infancy to know  The comforts which from labour flow  Are independent of the great  Nor know the wants of pride and state  Why is our food so very sweet  Because we earn before we eat  Why are our wants so very few  Because we nature's calls pursue  Whence our complacency of mind  Because we act our parts assign'd  Have we incessant tasks to do  Is not all nature busy too  Doth not the sun with constant pace  Persist to run his annual race  Do not the stars which shine so bright  Renew their courses every night  Doth not the ox obedient bow  His patient neck and draw the plough  Or when did e'er the generous steed  Withhold his labour or his speed  If you all nature's system scan  The only idle thing is man  A wanton Sparrow long'd to hear  Their sage discourse and strait drew near  The bird was talkative and loud  And very pert and very proud  As worthless and as vain a thing  Perhaps as  ver wore a wing  She found as on a spray she sat  The little friends were deep in chat  That virtue was their favourite theme  And toil and probity their scheme  Such talk was hateful to her breast  She thought them arrant prudes at best  When to display her naughty mind  Hunger with cruelty combin'd  She view'd the Ant with savage eyes  And hopt and hopt to snatch her prize  The bee who watch'd her opening bill  And guess'd her fell design to kill  Ask'd her from what her anger rose  And why she treated Ants as foes  The Sparrow her reply began  And thus the conversation ran  Whenever I'm dispos'd to dine  I think the whole creation mine  That I'm a bird of high degree  And every insect made for me  Hence oft I search the emmet brood  For emmets are delicious food  And oft in wantonness and play  I slay ten thousand in a day  For truth it is without disguise  That I love mischief as my eyes  Oh fie the honest Bee reply'd  I fear you make base man your guide  Of every creature sure the worst  Tho' in creation's scale the sirst  Ungrateful man 'tis strange he thrives  Who burns the Bees to rob their hives  I hate his vile administration  And so do all the emmet nation  What fatal foes to birds are men  Quite to the Eagle from the Wren  Oh do not men's example take  Who mischief do for mischief's sake  But spare the Anther worth demands  Esteem and friendship at your hands  A mind with every virtue blest  Must raise compassion in your breast  Virtue rejoin'd the sneering bird  Where did you learn that gothic word  Since I was hatch'd I never heard  That virtue was at all rever'd  But say it was the ancients' claim  Yet moderns disavow the name  Unless my dear you read romances  I cannot reconcile your fancies  Virtue in fairy tales is seen  To play the goddess or the queen  But what's a queen without the pow'r  Or beauty child without a dow'r  Yet this is all that virtue brags  At best 'tis only worth in rags  Such whims my very heart derides  Indeed you make me burst my sides  Trust me Miss Beeto speak the truth  I've copyed men from earliest youth  The same our taste the same our school  Passion and appetite our rule  And call me bird or call me sinner  I'll ne'er forego my sport or dinner  A prowling cat the miscreant spies  And wide expands her amber eyes  Near and more near Grimalkin draws  She wags her tail protends her paws  Then springing on her thoughtless prey  She bore the vicious bird away  Thus in her cruelty and pride  The wicked wanton Sparrow dy'd  ODE on a STORM  WITH gallant pomp and beauteous pride  The floating pile in harbour rode  Proud of her freight the swelling tide  Reluctant left the vessel's side  And rais'd it as she flow'd  The waves with Eastern breezes curl'd  Had silver'd half the liquid plain  The anchors weigh'd the sails unfurl'd  Serenely mov'd the wooden world  And stretch'd along the main  The scaly natives of the deep  Press to admire the vast machine  In sporting gambols round it leap  Or swimming low due distance keep  In homage to their queen  Thus as life glides in gentle gale  Pretended friendship waits on pow'r  But early quits the borrow'd veil  When adverse Fortune shifts the sail  And hastens to devour  In vain we fly approaching ill  Danger can multiply its form  Expos'd we fly like Jonas still  And heaven when 'tis heaven's will  O'ertakes us in a storm  The distant surges foamy white  Foretel the furious blast  Dreadful tho' distant was the sight  Confed'rate winds and waves unite  And menace ev'ry mast  Winds whistling thro' the shrouds proclaim  A fatal harvest on the deck  Quick in pursuit as active flame  Too soon the rolling ruin came  And ratify'd the wreck  Thus Adam smil'd with newborn grace  Life's flame inspir'd by heav'nly breath  Thus the same breath sweeps off his race  Disorders Nature's beauteous face  And spreads disease and death  Stripp'd of her pride the vessel rolls  And as by sympathy she knew  The secret anguish of our souls  With inward deeper groans condoles  The danger of her crew  Now what avails it to be brave  On liquid precipices hung  Suspended on a breaking wave  Beneath us yawn'd a seagreen grave  And silenc'd ev'ry tongue  The faithless flood forsook her keel  And downward launch'd the lab'ring hull  Stun'd she forgot awhile to reel  And feel almost or seem'd to feel  A momentary lull  Thus in the jaws of death we lay  Nor light nor comfort found us there  Lost in the gulph and floods of spray  No sun to chear us nor a ray  Of hope but all despair  The nearer shore the more despair  While certain ruin waits on land  Should we pursue our wishes there  Soon we recant the fatal pray'r  And strive to shun the strand  At length the Being whose behest  Reduc'd this Chaos into form  His goodness and his pow'r express'd  He spokeand as a God suppress'd  Our troubles and the storm  ISAIAH XXXIV  COME near ye nations and give ear O earth  Ye distant isles and continents remote  Wheree'er dispers'd beneath the vast expanse  Of heav'n's high roof attend Attend and hear  Your doom tremendous ratify'd above  Sad retribution of enormous guilt  Which calling loud for justice and revenge  Flew swift as light up to the throne of God  And pull'd down dire destruction on the earth  The mighty God with all his thunder arm'd  Will cast abroad the terrors of his wrath  And show'r down vengeance on the guilty land  The Lord of hosts amidst a night of clouds  And with the majesty of darkness crown'd  Thunder'd aloft and from the inmost heav'n  Hurl'd down impetuous fury swift as thought  Through th' azure void widestretch'd from pole to pole  To ravage all the boundless universe  As when a blust'ring wind rolls from the North  And shakes all autumn with the driving blast  So shall the fury of th' Omnipotent  Destroy the nations and confound their arms  Swords shields and spears and all the pow'rs of war  With eager speed rush o'er th' embattled ranks  And thro' the thick battalions urge its way  JEHOVAH's arm will shake the vast convex  And wrap the whole circumference around  In wasting desolation ruin wide  Destructive slaughter ghastly to behold  Dire specimen of wrath omnipotent  Shall march tremendous o'er the burden'd earth  Oppress'd and conscious of unusual weight  Shrinking beneath the heavy load of death  The purple piles and mountains of the slain  Expiring wretches pouring out their souls  With bursts of groans shall fill the lab'ring world  Each slaughter'd corps shall breath a pestilence  And wide around diffuse the scents of death  Th' eternal hills shall float in seas of blood  And mountains vanish in the crimson tide  Nature's huge volume shall be folded up  Like a vast scroll and all the glittering orbs  Drop from the heavens like autumnal leaves  Or the ripe fig when sultry  Sirius  reigns  While peals of thunder rattling in the skies  Shall roll incessant o'er th' astonish'd world  Death and destruction threat'ning all below  And in substantial darkness high enthron'd  Shall draw the curtains of eternal night  And spread confusion hideous o'er the earth  As when the embryo world ere time began  In one rude heap one undigested mass  Of jarring discord and disorder lay  The sun amaz'd to see the wild obscure  No more with radiant light shall gild the skies  No more diffusing his allgenial beams  On the high mountains spread the shining morn  But downwards flaming thro' the vast immense  Shall hide his glory in eternal night  Thus in loud thunder speaks th' Almighty Sire  In copious slaughter will I take my sword  And  Idumea  thou shalt swim in blood  The Lord shall hasten from the lofty skies  Destruction on his aweful footsteps waits  Death stalks before ruin on every side  Proclaims the terror of an angry God  The ravenous sword pamper'd with reeking gore  Drunk with the blood of half the rebel world  Shall there be sheath'd in  Israel  's stubborn foes  Bozrah  with human sacrifice shall smoke  And  Idumea  thoughtless of her fate  Shall feel the smart of heav'n's avenging rod  The great the smallth' oppressor and th' oppress'd  Shall join promiscuous in the common heap  And one vast ruin shall involve them all  For  Israel  's God is girt with burning rage  And vows a last revenge to  Zion  's foes  The silver streams that shine along the plain  And chide their banks and tinkle as they run  Shall stop and stagnate to a sable pool  And black with mud unconscious of a tide  No more shall charm the sense or lull the soul  Or in soft murmers die upon the ear  But in crude streams and deadly stench exhale  And with contagious vapours load the sky  Rapacious flames in pyramids of fire  Shall burn unquenchable and sulph'rous smoke  Advancing o'er the horizontal plain  In dusky wreaths roll ever to the skies  Th' inhospitable land left desolate  Unfruitful but in ev'ry noxious weed  Shall be a lonely desart waste and wild  Within whose silent confines none shall dwell  Nor ever more be heard th' harmonious voice  Of warbling birds that heretofore were wont  In vocal choir to animate the grove  And from the shady covert of the trees  Dispense sweet music to the list'ning vale  But hooting owls that spread their lazy wings  O'er the dark gloom and with their boding screams  Double the native horrors of the night  These with the cormorants shall dwell therein  Securely in the upper lintels lodge  And in the windows direful dirges sing  God shall extend and bare his thund'ring arm  And with confusion circumscribe the land  Where are the nobles and the mighty chiefs  That in soft ease their silken moments waste  To whom their prostrate vassals throng in crowds  Striving who first shall aweful homage pay  And adoration Them shall they invoke  But all in vain their names shall be no more  But in their stead more worthy savages  With rapine uncontroulable shall reign  And nobler brutes shall canton out the land  Those regal domes and tow'ring palaces  That high in clouds exalt their impious heads  Reflecting thro' the liquid firmament  Home to the distant ken a dazling blaze  Thorns shall surround and nettles grow within  Ivy shall creep along the painted walls  The matted grass o'erspread the polish'd floor  And brambles vile entwine the empty throne  While beasts from different climes joyous to sind  A place of rest to man alone denied  Shall take possession of the gilded domes  The shaggy satyrs that old forests haunt  The ostrich and his mate and dragons huge  Shall sport and revel in the dreary waste  There the hoarse screechowls that in dead of night  Upon the chimney tops perch ominous  While songs obscene the silent hours disturb  Shall in loud shrieks their sad presages tell  Shall unmolested solitude enjoy  And desolation make more desolate  Ravens and vulturs scenting from afar  The universal slaughter shall come forth  From the high mountain and the humble vale  Croaking in hideous consort as they fly  Dark'ning the heavens with their ghastly train  And glut their hungry jaws with human prey  Not one of these shall fail none want her mate  But shall for ever such the Lord's decree  In  Edom  's ruins wanton undisturb'd  This is the fate ordain'd for  Zion  's foes  ISAIAH XXXV  WHEN  Idumea  and the nations round  Th' inveterate foes of  Israel  and of God  Lie vanquish'd dormant on the dreary waste  Of far extended ruin and involv'd  In hideous woe and desolation wide  Then shall  Judea  lift her chearful head  Put forth the leaves of glad prosperity  And aster all the gloomy scene of grief  And sad affliction flourish and revive  In all the bright serenity of peace  As the gay rose when winter storms are past  Warm'd with the influ'nce of a kinder sun  Comes from the bud with a vermilion blush  Chearing the sight and scattering all around  A balmy odour that perfumes the skies  She shall rejoice with joy unspeakable  And fraught with richest blessings from above  Spring forth in all the pride of  Lebanon  Whose losty cedars wond'rous to behold  In bodies huge and to the skies erect  Stand eminent branch over branch outspread  In reg'lar distances and verdant shades  Emblem of happy state Nor shall the hills  Of fragrant  Carmel  rich in fruitful soil  Nor  Sharon  's flow'ry plain in all its bloom  Array'd in Nature's goodliest attire  And breathing fresh a gale of heav'nly sweets  Spring forth in greater glory For the Lord  His goodness will declare that knows no bounds  And all the people shall behold his might  And see the wonders of omnipotence  Strengthen the languid nerves ye seers and bid  The trembling hand be strong Call into life  The dissipated spirits and confirm  The feeble knees th' unactive joints support  And bid the lazy blood flow briskly on  And circulate with joy thro' every vein  Comfort th' oppress'd and smooth the ruffled mind  Say to th' afflicted heart devoid of hope  Behold th' Almighty rushes from the skies  Ev'n  Israel  's God from his refulgent throne  Of glory comes but not with radiant blaze  Of light ev'n light invisible as when  To  Moses  on Mount  Horeb  he appear'd  And sent his faithful servant to redeem  Ungrateful  Israel  from  Egyptian  bonds  Nor with the music of a still soft voice  As when h' inform'd the prophet of his will  But in a black and dreadful hemisphere  Of darkness arm'd with flaming thunderbolts  And flashes of red lightning to increase  The woe and make ev'n darkness visible  The hills shall tremble at his dire approach  And fearful mountains pil'd up to the clouds  Fall down precipitant with rapid force  And spread a plain immense For God will come  Full fraught with vengeance to consume your foes  You in his bounteous mercy to protect  Then shall the eyes long clos'd in blackest night  To whom no gladsome dawn of light appear'd  But comfortless impenetrable shade  Shake off the film of darkness and behold  The long expected day New scenes of joy  Shall then appear and various prospects rise  To chear the newborn sight The deafen'd ear  On whose dull nerves sadmoping Silence dwelt  And lock'd from music's note or voice of man  Shall open glad its labyrinths of sound  Again the stringed instrument shall feel  And the sweet words of social converse hear  The lame infirm creeping with slow advance  Dragging with pain reluctant feet along  And scarcely by the friendly crutch sustain'd  Shall throw th' unserviceable prop aside  And stand erect exulting like a roe  Upon Mount  Tabor  frisking nimbly round  On the soft verdant turf with wanton tread  Skimming along the surface of the plain  Or lightly bounding o'er the rising ground  The dumb for melancholy silence fram'd  Cut off from friendly converse with mankind  Striving in vain the sad defect to mend  With gabb'ring noise of broken syllables  Confus'd shall talk in dialects compleat  And tongues that knew not how to speak shall sing  New scenes of joy shall gladden ev'ry face  And universal peace o'erspread the land  The glowing ground gaping with burning thirst  Shall greedily suck in the humid tide  Pouring from caverns of the craggy hills  In limpid streams still warbling as they fall  Melodious murmurs down the ample glade  And crystal springs refresh the thirty land  Where heretofore the curling serpent lay  In many a wily labyrinth selfroll'd  Or swept deceitful o'er the dusty plain  In horrid spires and many a tow'ring maze  The trembling reed shall wave his fringed top  And the tall rush in slender spires uprise  The swampy marsh shall its broad flag produce  With bending willow sport of every wind  And vegetable earth new bloom display  Delightful with prolific verdure cloth'd  A wasteful desart now and barren soil  A way shall be prepar'd a path direct  Mark'd out by line with an unerring hand  Ev'n a streight path which God himself shall make  It shall be call'd THE WAY OF HOLINESS  A way to sacred foosteps only known  Where the unhallow'd shall no entrance find  Nor impious feet profane the sacred ground  God shall attend the motions of the just  Watch o'er their steps and guide them as they go  And none shall wander from the obvious path  For who can err when God directs the way  The rampant lion shall not wander there  Nor fiery tiger roaring for his prey  Nor prowling wolf that howls along the plain  With the keen pangs of raging hunger stung  Nor surly bear in  Nebo  's mountains bred  Or  Carmel's  forest ranging merciless  Such as came furious from the neighb'ring groves  Of ancient  Bethel  with voracious speed  Grinning destruction as they roam'd along  And slew the mockers of the good old seer  But free and unmolested shall they walk  Whom heav'n protects and God vouchsafes to guide  The ransom'd captives weary of the yoke  The heavy yoke of long oppressive thrall  Shall chearfully return to happier climes  In melody break forth the gladden'd heart  That speaks deliverance and the voice of joy  Judah  shall witness to the grateful song  And faithful  Zion  echo back the sound  No signs of woe shall hang upon the cheek  No shuddering fear nor horrible despair  But grief with all its melancholy train  Of huge dismay shall fly from ev'ry face  Gladness shall crown the head peace fill the heart  And endless rapture dwell on ev'ry brow  WOODSTOCK PARK A POEM  By WILLIAM HARRISON  Habitarunt Dî quoque silvas  VIRG  KIND heav'n at length successfully implor'd  To Britain's arms her hero had restor'd  And now our fears remov'd with loud applause  Jointly we crown'd his conduct and his cause  Transporting pleasure rais'd each drooping tongue  The peasants shouted and the poets sung  The poets sung tho' Addison alone  Adorns thy laurels and maintains his own  In him alone great MARLBOROUGH is seen  Thy graceful motion and thy godlike mien  Each action he exalts with rage divine  And the full Danube flows in ev'ry line  But we in vain to that sublime aspire  So heatless glowworms emulate the fire  Shine without warmth another song prepare  My Muse the country is the Muse's care  Thither thy much lov'd MARLBOROUGH pursue  With eager verse and keep thy theme in view  But oh what joyful numbers can disclose  The various raptures his approach bestows  How vales resound how crowds collected share  The radiant glories of the matchless pair  The gen'rous youths within whose bosoms glow  Some secret unripe longings for a foe  Surveying here the favourite of Fame  Conceive new hopes and nurse the growing flame  While softer maids confess a pleasing pain  And sighing wish he had been born a swain  So when the pow'rs appeas'd bad discord cease  And Greece obtain'd from jarring gods a peace  The god of war and beauteous queen of love  To Cyprian shades their peaceful chariot drove  Shepherds and nymphs attending form'd the train  And mirth unusual revell'd on the plain  And should the gods once more their heav'n forego  To range on earth and bless mankind below  O'er all the globe no region would be sound  With nobler soil or brighter beauty crown'd  Phoebus for this would change his Delphic grove  Juno her Samos and his Ida Jove  Olympic games no longer should delight  But neigb'ring plains afford a nobler sight  Where England's great Aeneas standing by  Impatient youths on winged coursers fly  Urg'd by his presence they outstrip the wind  Involv'd in smoke and leave the Muse behind  But see once more returns the rival train  And now they stretch now bending loose the rein  And fears and hopes beat high in ev'ry vein  'Till one long since successful in the field  Exerts that strength he first with art conceal'd  Then swift as light'ning darted through the skies  Springs forward to the goal and bears away the prize  By arts like these all other palms are won  They end with glory who with caution run  We neither write nor act what long can last  When the first heat sees all our vigour past  But jaded both their shortliv'd mettle lose  The furious statesman and the fiery Muse  The contest ended night with gloomy face  O'erspreads the heav'n and now with equal pace  The victor and the vanquish'd quit the place  Sleep's friendly office is to all the same  His conquest he forgets and they their shame  Next morning ere the sun with sickly ray  O'er doubtful shades maintains the dawning day  The sprightly horn proclaims some danger near  And hounds harmonious to the sportsman's ear  With deepmouth'd notes rouse up the trembling deer  Startled he leaps aside and list'ning round  This way and that explores the hostile sound  Arm'd for that fight which he declines with shame  Too fond of life too negligent of fame  For Nature to display her various art  Had fortify'd his head but not his heart  Those spears which useless on his front appear'd  On any else had been ador'd and fear'd  But honours disproportion'd are a load  Grandeur a specious curse when ill bestow'd  Thus void of hope and panting with surprize  In vain he'd combat and as vainly flies  Of paths mysterious whether to pursue  The scented track informs the lab'ring crew  With speed redoubled they the hint embrace  Whilst animating music warms the chace  Flush'd are their hopes and with one gen'ral cry  They echo through the woods and sound their conquest nigh  Not so the prey he now for safety bends  From enemies profess'd to faithless friends  Who to the wretched own no shelter due  But fly more swistly than his foes pursue  This last disgrace with indignation fires  His drooping soul and gen'rous rage inspires  By all forsaken he resolves at length  To try the poor remains of wasted strength  With looks and mien majestic stands at bay  And whets his horns for the approaching fray  Too late alas for the first charge begun  Soon he repents what cowardice had done  Owns the mistake of his o'erhasty flight  And aukwardly maintains a languid fight  Here and there aiming a successless blow  And only seems to nod upon the foe  So coward princes who at war's alarm  Start from their greatness and themselves disarm  With recollected forces strive in vain  Their empire or their honour to regain  And turn to rally on some distant plain  Whilst the fierce conqu'ror bravely urges on  Improves th' advantage and ascends the throne  Forgive great Denham that in abject verse  What richly thou adorn'st I thus rehearse  Thy noble chace all others does exceed  In artful fury and welltemper'd speed  We read with pleasure imitate with pain  Where fancy fires and judgment holds the rein  Goddess proceed and as to relicks found  Altars we raise and consecrate the ground  Pay thou thy homage to an aged seat  Small in itself but in its owner great  Where Chaucer sacred name whole years employ'd  Coy Nature courted and at length enjoy'd  Mov'd at his suit the naked goddess came  Reveal'd her charms and recompens'd his flame  Rome's pious king with like success retir'd  And taught his people what his Nymph inspir'd  Hence flow descriptions regularly fine  And beauties such as never can decline  Each lively image makes the reader start  And poetry invades the painter's art  This Dryden saw and with his wonted fate  Rich in himself endeavour'd to translate  Took wond'rous pains to do the author wrong  And set to modern tune his ancient song  Cadence and sound which we so prize and use  Ill suit the majesty of Chaucer's Muse  His language only can his thoughts express  Old honest Clytus scorns the Persian dress  Inimitable bard  In raptures loud I would thy praises tell  And on th' inspiring theme for ever dwell  Did not the maid whose wond'rous beauty seen  Inflam'd great Henry and incens'd his queen  With pleasing sorrow move me to survey  A neighb'ring structure aweful in decay  For ever sacred and in ruin blest  Which heretofore contain'd that lovely guest  Admiring strangers who attentive come  To learn the tale of this romantic dome  By faithful monuments instructed view  Tho' time should spare what civil rage can do  Where landskips once in rich apartments high  Through various prospects led the wand'ring eye  Where painted rivers flow'd through flow'ry meads  And hoary mountains rear'd their aweful heads  Or where by hands of curious virgins wrought  In rich array embroider'd heroes fought  Now hemlock thrives and weeds of pow'rful charms  O'er ragged walls extend their baleful arms  Monsters obscene their pois'nous roots invade  And bloated pant beneath the gloomy shade  Thus noblest buildings are with ease effac'd  And what's well wrote alone will always last  Ev'n Vanbrugh's fame that does so brightly shine  In rules exact and greatness of design  Would fall a victim to devouring age  Had not that hand which built adorn'd the stage  Wit so refin'd without the poet's pain  Such artful scenes in such a flowing vein  O'er latest aeras deathless will prevail  When Doric and Corinthian orders fail  When each proud pyramid its height foregoes  And sinks beneath the base on which it rose  Ye British fair whose names but mention'd give  Worth to the tale and make the poem live  Vouchsafe to hear whilst briefly I relate  Great Henry's flame and Rosamonda's fate  Piere'd to the soul by her resistless eyes  Lo at her feet the scepter'd vassal lies  Now big with hopes now tortur'd with despair  Nor toils nor pleasures can divert his care  Her voice her look ten thousand wounds impart  And fix the pleasing image in his heart  Such as if Fame has drawn the picture true  Her native lustre sung nor added new  Might tempt the thund'rer from his bless'd abode  To court that beauty which himself bestow'd  Features so wrought not Venus' self displays  When dress'd by youthful pens in vocal lays  Not equal charms in all the Graces join  And only Sunderland is more divine  Thus fatally adorn'd the hapless fair  Receives his suit and listens to his prayer  Fond of her ruin pleas'd to be undone  She reaps the conquest that her eyes had won  Tho' tongues obscure at humble distance plac'd  May censure joys which they despair to taste  Whene'cr th' attack is made all jointly own  What bright temptations sparkle from a throne  Could love no entrance find ambition can  They clasp the monarch who despise the man  Beyond his boldest wish the hero bless'd  Riots in joys too great to be express'd  And now with caution does the means pursue  As they are great to make them lasting too  'Mid shades obscure remote from vulgar eye  An artful edifice is rear'd on high  Through which inextricable windings run  Lost in themselves and end where they begun  Maeander thus as ancient stories feign  In curling channels wander'd o'er the plain  Oft by himself o'ertook himself survey'd  And backward turning to his fountain stray'd  Nor much unlike to these are mazes found  By loit'ring hinds imprinted on the ground  Who when releas'd by some distinguish'd day  Lead ruddy damsels forth to rural play  And on the flow'ry vale or mountain's brow  The yielding glebe in wanton furrows plow  Ye Sylvan Nymphs who with a pleasing pride  O'er shady groves and secret vows preside  On this mysterious pile with care attend  Protect the mistress and the prince befriend  With both conspire to blind the wary dame  And screen th' important tale from babbling Fame  Ah faithless guards in vain with od'rous smoke  We feast your altars and your aid invoke  When nuptial debts are now no longer paid  More ways than one the rover is betray'd  Affected passion does no more suffice  And aukward kindness proves a weak disguise  Woman by nature arm'd against deceit  With indignation smiles upon the cheat  Looks down with scorn and only burns to know  Th' uncertain author of her certain woe  As a fierce lioness of Lybian race  Struck by the hunter's hand with furious pace  Strides o'er the sands and red with recent gore  Yells out her pain and makes the forest roar  So raves the queen incens'd and loudly tells  The restless grief that in her bosom dwells  For her lov'd lord from her embraces fled  Her slighted beauty and her widow'd bed  What dire effects her kindled fury wrought  Whether by pointed steel or poison'd draught  Th' unguarded rival fell forbear to ask  Th' unwilling Muse declines the mournful task  Recoils with anguish wounded to the soul  Feels ev'ry stab and drinks th' invenom'd bowl  Thee beauteous fair Love made a pris'ner here  But great Eliza's doom was more severe  By hate implacable to shades confin'd  Where still the native grandeur of her mind  Clear and unsully'd shone with radiant grace  Gilding the dusky horrors of the place  No nobler gifts can heav'n itself pour down  Than to deserve and to despise a crown  In some dark room for pompous sorrow made  Methinks I see the royal virgin laid  With anxious thoughts employ'd on former times  Their various fate their glory and their crimes  Th'illboding place a just concernment gives  Since Elinora in Maria lives  Mariabut forgotten be her name  In long oblivion lost o'erlook'd by fame  Do thou O Albion from remembrance chace  Thy persecuted sons thy martyr'd race  And freed at length by ANNA's milder ray  From furious zeal and arbitrary sway  Enjoy the present or the future scene  With promis'd blessings fraught without one cloud serene  Stop goddess stop recall thy daring flight  I cannot must not tempt the wond'rous height  Themes so exalted with proportion'd wing  Let Addison let Garth let Congreve sing  Whilst list'ning nations crowd the vocal lyre  Foretaste their bliss and languish with desire  To thee thy song thy province is assign'd  And what should foremost stand is yet behind  Silenc'd be all antiquity could boast  And let old Woodstock in the new be lost  No more her Edwards or her Henrys please  Their spoils of war or monuments of peace  By CHURCHILL's hand so largely is outdone  What either prince has built and both have won  With admiration struck we gaze around  The fancy entertain the sense confound  And whilst our eyes o'er the foundation roam  Presage the wonders of the finish'd dome  Thus did our hero's early dawn display  Th' auspicious beams of his advancing day  We who in humble cells and learn'd retreat  Are strangers to the splendor of the great  On barren cliffs of speculation thrown  Of all besides unknowing and unknown  Pronounce our fabrics just in ev'ry part  And scorn the poor attempts of modern art  Proud of his cottage so exults the swain  Who loves the sorest and admires the plain  'Till here convinc'd unwillingly we find  Our Wickhams and

By Mr MERRICK  IF Virtue prompt thy willing mind  To actions gen'rous good and kind  Fortune beyond thy hopes shall bless  Thy toils and crown them with success  But he whose bounties only rise  From prospects of a future prize  With sorrow shall compute his gains  And reap repentance for his pains  Precepts are often found to fail  So take instruction from my tale  In ancient days there liv'd a priest  Inshrin'd within whose pious breast  Fair Virtue shone his open look  Gave sanction to each word he spoke  Fix'd to no home in mean array  From place to place he took his way  Instructing as he went along  And dealing blessings to the throng  The truth he labour'd to express  In language plain as was his dress  Yet all with secret rapture hung  On every accent of his tongue  A silent eloquence there ran  Through all the actions of the man  They mark'd his soul's unblemish'd frame  His precept and his life the same  It chanc'd as musing once he stray'd  Around him night's descending shade  Unheeded stole through paths unknown  With darkling steps he wander'd on  And wish'd to shroud his weary head  Beneath some hospitable shed  When through the gloom a sudden ray  Sprung forth and shot across the way  Led by the light a cott he found  A pious dame the mansion own'd  Whose open heart tho' small her store  Ne'er turn'd the stranger from her door  Think at the sight of such a guest  What transport rose within her breast  With joy the friendly board she spread  And plac'd him in her warmest bed  Deep sunk in sleep the trav'ler lay  Tir'd with the labours of the day  'Tis best as ablest critics deem  To suit your language to your theme  Obsequious to their rules the Muse  In humbler strain her tale pursues  The matron while her thankful guest  Had shar'd with her the slender feast  With curious eye had view'd him o'er  Had mark'd the tatter'd garb he wore  And through the yawning frieze had seen  No traces of a shirt within  And now her hands with pious care  A shirt of homespun cloth prepare  'Twas coarse but would the longer hold  And serve to fence him from the cold  The toil employ'd her all the night  And ended with the rising light  The priest arose at break of day  And hasten'd to pursue his way  With thanks he took the finish'd vest  The hospitable dame he bless'd  "And that thy charity he said  "May fall with int'rest on thy head  "May thy first work when I am gone  "Continue 'till the setting sun"  She heard but soon her houshold care  Had banish'd from her thoughts the pray'r  The remnant of her cloth she took  And meafur'd out her little stock  Beneath her hands the length'ning piece  Surpriz'd her with a vast increase  Astonish'd at a sight so new  She measur'd still and still it grew  As when in sleep with winged pace  O'er hills and plains we urge the race  With eager hopes we onward bend  And think our labour near its end  But mimick Fancy soon supplies  Newscenes to cheat our wond'ring eyes  Before our feet new plains extend  New vallies sink new hills ascend  And still the goal when these are o'er  Appears as distant as before  In such a dream with such surprize  From morn to eve the woman plies  Her task but when the setting ray  Had clos'd her labour with the day  With joy the wond'rous heap survey'd  And saw her bounty well repay'd  A neighb'ring dame the story known  Much wish'd to make the case her own  For tho' she ne'er was seen before  To lodge the stranger or the poor  She wisely thought on one so good  Her charity were well bestow'd  As by her door his journey lay  She stop'd the trav'ler on his way  Beg'd him to enter and receive  Such welcome as her house could give  The priest comply'd and ent'ring found  The board with various plenty crown'd  On heaps of down he past the night  And slumber'd 'till the morning light  At break of day the dame address'd  In friendly guise her rev'rend guest  Linen so coarse she said was ne'er  Design'd for Christian backs to wear  And as it griev'd her to survey  Such virtue in so mean array  Herself had toil'd with sleepless eyes  To furnish him with fresh supplies  Fine was the texture such as comes  From wealthy Holland's skilful looms  The priest accepts the proffer'd boon  He thanks her for her kindness shown  And grateful as he leaves her door  Repeats the pray'r he made before  Just parted from the holy man  With eager haste the matron ran  To reach her cloth and had design'd  To measure what was left behind  But thinking first that as the pray'r  For the whole day had fix'd her care  One labour would employ it all  And leave no time for Nature's call  Ere to the destin'd work she goes  She deems it best to pluck a rose  The hissing geese as forth she went  Gave omens of the dire event  The herds that graz'd the neighb'ring plain  Look'd up and snuff'd the coming rain  The bird that screams at midnight hours  Diviner of approaching show'rs  Full on the left with hideous croak  Stood flutt'ring on a blasted oak  Amazement seiz'd the trembling dame  When first she saw the plenteous stream  She wonder'd much and much she fear'd  And think how Niobe appear'd  When chang'd into a rock she stood  And at her feet the headlong flood  With downward force impetuous ran  High foaming o'er the delug'd plain  So look'd the dame when all around  The torrent smoak'd upon the ground  Still spreading wider than before  It seem'd a sea without a shore  Your bards that wrote in heathen days  Had such a theme employ'd their lays  Had tortur'd their inventive brain  With dire portents to fill the strain  Had bid the neighb'ring river mourn  His alter'd stream and tainted urn  Or made the Naiads lift their heads  Astonish'd from their wat'ry beds  And seated on the river's side  Squeeze from their locks the briny tide  But little skill'd in Pagan lore  I pass such idle fancies o'er  Truth is my care whose lovely face  Shines brightest in the plainest dress  At eve the torrent stopt it's course  Stung with vexation and remorse  The dame laments her fruitless cost  Her hopes deceiv'd her labour lost  Nor think that here her suff'rings end  Reproach and infamy attend  Surrounding boys wheree'er she came  With insults loud divulge her shame  And sarmers stop her with demands  Of recompence for damag'd lands  The WISH  By the Same  HOW short is life's uncertain space  Alas how quickly done  How swift the wild precarious chace  And yet how difficult the race  How very hard to run  Youth stops at first its wilful ears  To Wisdom's prudent voice  Till now arriv'd to riper years  Experienc'd age worn out with cares  Repents its earlier choice  What though its prospects now appear  So pleasing and refin'd  Yet groundless hope and anxious fear  By turns the busy moments share  And prey upon the mind  Since then false joys our fancy cheat  With hopes of real bliss  Ye guardian pow'rs that rule my fate  The only wish that I create  Is all compriz'd in this  May I through life's uncertain tide  Be still from pain exempt  May all my wants be still supply'd  My state too low t' admit of pride  And yet above contempt  But should your Providence divine  A greater bliss intend  May all those blessings you design  If e'er those blessings shall be mine  Be center'd in a friend  The BEARS and BEES A FABLE  By the same  AS two young Bears in wanton mood  Forthissuing from a neighbouring wood  Came where th'industrious Bees had stor'd  In artful cells their luscious hoard  O'erjoy'd they seiz'd with eager haste  Luxurious on the rich repast  Alarm'd at this the little crew  About their ears vindictive flew  The beasts unable to sustain  Th' unequal combat quit the plain  Halfblind with rage and mad with pain  Their native shelter they regain  There sit and now discreeter grown  Too late their rashness they bemoan  And this by dear experience gain  That pleasure's ever bought with pain  So when the gilded baits of vice  Are plac'd before our longing eyes  With greedy haste we snatch our fill  And swallow down the latent ill  But when experience opes our eyes  Away the fancy'd pleasure flies  It flies but oh too late we find  It leaves a real sting behind  A FRAGMENT  By the Same  * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * * * *  When recent in the womb I lay  Ere yet my life began  Thy care preserv'd the sleeping clay  And form'd it into man  Oh may this frame that rising grew  Beneath thy plastic hands  Be studious ever to pursue  Whate'er thy will commands  The soul that moves this earthly load  Thy semblance let it bear  Nor lose the traces of the God  Who stamp'd his image there  The CAMELION A FABLE after Monsieur DE LA MOTTE  By the Same  OFT has it been my lot to mark  A proud conceited talking spark  With eyes that hardly serv'd at most  To guard their master 'gainst a post  Yet round the world the blade has been  To see whatever cou'd be seen  Returning from his finish'd tour  Grown ten times perter than before  Whatever word you chance to drop  The travell'd fool your mouth will stop  "Sir if my judgment you'll allow  "I've seenand sure I ought to know  So begs you'd pay a due submission  And acquiesce in his decision  Two travellers of such a cast  As o'er Arabia's wilds they past  And on their way in friendly chat  Now talk'd of this and then of that  Discours'd awhile 'mongst other matter  Of the Camelion's form and nature  "A stranger animal cries one  "Sure never liv'd beneath the sun  "A lizard's body lean and long  "A fish's head a serpent's tongue  "It's tooth with triple claw disjoin'd  "And what a length of tail behind  "How slow it's pace and then it's hue  "Who ever saw so fine a blue"  "Hold there the other quick replies  "'Tis greenI saw it with these eyes  "As late with open mouth it lay  "And warm'd it in the sunny ray  "Stretch'd at its ease the beast I view'd  "And saw it eat the air for food"  "I've seen it Sir as well as you  "And must again affirm it blue  "At leisure I the beast survey'd  "Extended in the cooling shade"  "'Tis green 'tis green Sir I assure ye  "Green cries the other in a fury  "Why Sird'ye think I've lost my eyes"  "'Twere no great loss the friend replies  "For if they always serve you thus  "You'll find 'em but of little use"  So high at last the contest rose  From words they almost came to blows  When luckily came by a third  To him the question they refer'd  And beg'd he'd tell 'em if he knew  Whether the thing was green or blue  "Sirs cries the umpire cease your pother  "The creature's neither one nor t' other  "I caught the animal last night  "And view'd it o'er by candlelight  "I mark'd it well'twas black as jet  "You starebut Sirs I've got it yet  "And can produce it" "Pray Sir do  "I'll lay my life the thing is blue"  "And I'll be sworn that when you've seen  "The reptile you'll pronounce him green"  "Well then at once to ease the doubt  "Replies the man I'll turn him out  "And when before your eyes I've set him  "If you don't find him black I'll eat him"  He said then full before their sight  Produc'd the beast and lo 'twas white  Both star'd the man look'd wond'rous wise  "My children" the Camelion cries  Then first the creature found a tongue  "You all are right and all are wrong  "When next you talk of what you view  "Think others see as well as you  "Nor wonder if you find that none  "Prefers your eyesight to his own"  IMMORTALITY or the Consolation of HUMAN LIFE A MONODY  By THOMAS DENTON M A  Animi natura videtur  Atque animae claranda meis jam versibus esse  Et metus ille foras praeceps Acheruntis agendus  Funditus humanam qui vitam turbat ab imo  Omnia suffundus mortis nigrore  LUCR  I  WHEN blackbrow'd Night her dusky mantle spread  And wrapt in solemn gloom the sable sky  When soothing Sleep her opiate dews had shed  And seal'd in silken slumbers ev'ry eye  My wakeful thoughts admit no balmy rest  Nor the sweet bliss of soft oblivion share  But watchful woe distracts my aching breast  My heart the subject of corroding care  From haunts of men with wand'ring steps and slow  I solitary steal and sooth my pensive woe  II  Yet no fell passion's rough discordant rage  Untun'd the music of my tranquil mind  Ambition's tinsell'd charms could ne'er engage  No harbour there could sordid av'rice find  From lust's foul spring my grief disdains to flow  No sighs of envy from my bosom break  But soft compassion melts my soul to woe  And social tears fast trickle down my cheek  Ah me when nature gives one general groan  Each heart must beat with woe each voice responsive moan  III  Where'er I cast my moist'ned eyes around  Or stretch my prospect o'er the distant land  There foul  Corruption  's tainted steps are found  And  Death  grimvisag'd waves his iron hand  Tho' now soft  Pleasure  gild the smiling scene  And sportive  Joy  call forth her festive train  Sinking in night each vital form is seen  Like airblown bubbles on the wat'ry plain  Vid VIRG Aen lib ver seq  Fell  Death  like brooding  Harpy  the repast  Will snatch with talons foul or sour its grateful taste  IV  Ye smiling glories of the youthful year  That ope your fragrant bosoms to the day  That clad in all the pride of spring appear  And steep'd in dew your silken leaves display  In  Nature  's richest robes tho' thus bedight  Tho' her soft pencil trace your various dye  Tho' lures your roseate hue the charmed sight  Tho' odours sweet your nect'rous breath supply  Soon on your leaves  Time  's cank'rous tooth shall prey  Your dulcet dews exhale your beauteous bloom decay  V  Ye hedgerow elms beneath whose spreading shade  The grazing herds defy the ratt'ling shower  Ye lofty oaks in whose wide arms display'd  The clam'rous rook builds high his airy bower  Stript by hoar Winter's rough inclement rage  In mournful heaps your leafy honours lie  Ev'n your hard ribs shall feel the force of age  And your bare trunks the friendly shade deny  No more by chearful vegetation green  Your sapless bolls shall sink and quit th' evanid scene  VI  Ye feather'd warblers of the vernal year  That careless sing nor fear the frowns of fate  Tune your sad notes to death and winter drear  Ill suit these mirthful strains your transient state  No more with chearful song nor sprightly air  Salute the blushes of the rising day  With doleful ditties drooping wings repair  To the lone covert of the nightly spray  Where lovelorn  Philomela  strains her throat  Surround the budding thorn and swell the mournful note  VII  Come sighing  Elegy  with sweetest airs  Of melting music teach my grief to flow  I too must mix my sad complaint with theirs  Our fates are equal equal be our woe  Come  Melancholy  spread thy raven wing  And in thy ebon car by Fancy led  To the dark charnel vault thy vot'ry bring  The murky mansions of the mould'ring dead  Where dank dews breathe and taint the sickly skies  Where in sad loathsome heaps all human glory lies  VIII  Wrapt in the gloom of uncreated night  Secure we slept in senseless matter's arms  Nor pain could vex nor pallid fear affright  Our quiet fancy felt no dream's alarms  Soon as to life our animated clay  Awakes and conscious being opes our eyes  Care's fretful family at once dismay  With ghastly air a thousand phantoms rise  Sad  Horror  hangs o'er all the deep'ning gloom  Grief  prompts the labour'd sigh  Death  opes the marble tomb  IX  Yet life's strong love intoxicates the soul  And thirst of bliss inflames the fev'rous mind  With eager draughts we drain the pois'nous bowl  And in the dregs the cordial hope to find  O heav'n for this light end were mortals made  And plac'd on earth with happiness in view  To catch with cheated grasp the flitting shade  And with vain toil the fancied form pursue  Then give their shortliv'd being to the wind  As the wing'd arrow flies and leaves no track behind  X  Thus lonely wand'ring thro' the nightly shade  Against the stern decrees of stubborn Fate  To mockful Echo my complaints I made  Of life's short period or its toilsome state  'Tis deathlike silence all no sound I hear  Save the hearse raven croaking from the sky  Or scaly beetle murm'ring thro' the air  Or screechowl screaming with illomen'd cry  Save when with brazen tongue from yon high tow'r  The clock deepsounding speaks and counts the passing hour  XI  Pale Cynthia mounted on her silver car  O'er heav'n's blue concave drives her nightly round  See a torn abbey wrapt in gloom appear  Scatter'd in wild confusion o'er the ground  Here rav'nous  Ruin  lifts her wasteful hands  O'er bri'argrown grots and brambleshaded graves  Safe from her wrath one weeping marble stands  O'er which the mournful yew its umbrage waves  Ope ope thy pond'rous jaws thou friendly tomb  Close the sad deathful scene and snroud me in thy womb  XII  Forth issuing lovely from the gloomy shade  Which stately pines in phalanx deep compose  Fair above mortals comes a smiling maid  To sooth my sighs and chear my heartfelt woes  Here nurs'd by  Contemplation  matron sage  Where with mute  Solitude  she loves to dwell  In truth's fair lore she form'd her early age  And trim'd the midnight lamp in lonely cell  Here learn'd clear reason's heav'nsprung light to raise  O'er passion's lowborn mists or pleasure's spurious blaze  XIII  Her azure mantle flows with easy grace  Nor fashion's folds constrain nor custom's tye  An optic tube she bears each sphere to trace  That rolls its rapid orbit round the sky  Yet not to heav'n alone her view's confin'd  A clear reflecting plane she holds to show  The various movements of the reas'ning mind  How strange ideas link and habits grow  Passion's fierce impulse will's free power to scan  To paint the featur'd soul and mark th' internal man  XIV  Whence these sad strains said she of plaintive grief  Which pierce the sleepclos'd ear of peaceful rest  Oft has the sick'ning mind here found relief  Here quell'd the throbbing tumults of the breast  Lift up thy loaden eyes to yon fair cloud  Where moonsprung  A rainbow form'd by the rays of the moon at night an object often visible tho' from its languid colours not often ob∣serv'd  Iris  blends her beauteous dyes  I lift them soon and as I gazing stood  The fleeting phantom in a moment flies  Where beam'd the gilded arch of gaudy hue  Frowns the dark lou'ring cloud all gloomy to the view  XV  Life's emblem fit said I that roscid bow  The gay illusive pageant of an hour  To real semblance tricks her airy show  Then sinks in night's dull arms and is no more  Ah fool said she tho' now to fancy's sight  The violet pale the blushing red decays  Tho' now no painted cloud reflect the light  Nor drops prismatic break the falling rays  Yet still the colours live tho' none appear  Glow in the darting beam that gilds yon crystal sphere  XVI  Then let not  Fancy  with her vagrant blaze  Mislead in trackless paths of wild deceit  On Reason's steady lamp still ardent gaze  Led by her sober light to Truth's retreat  Tho' wond'ring Ign'rance sees each form decay  The breathless bird bare trunk and shrivel'd flow'r  New forms successive catch the vital ray  Sing their wild notes or smile th' allotted hour  And search creation's ample circuit round  Tho' modes of being change all life's immortal found  XVII  See the slow reptile grov'ling o'er the green  That trails thro' slimy paths its cumbrous load  Start in new beauty from the lowly scene  And wing with flutt'ring pride th' aetherial road  Burst their shellprisons see the feather'd kind  Where in dark durance pent awhile they lie  Dispread their painted plumage to the wind  Brush the brisk air swift shooting thro' the sky  Hail with their choral hymns the newborn day  Distend their joyswoln breasts and carol the sweet lay  XVIII  See man thro' varied periods fixt by fate  Ascend perfection's scale by slow degree  The plantlike foetus quits its senseless state  And helpless hangs sweetsmiling on the knee  Soon outward objects steal into the brain  Next pratt'ling childhood lisps with mimic air  Then mem'ry links her fleet ideal train  And sober reason rises to compare  The fullgrown breast some manly passion warms  It pants for glory's meed or beats to love's alarms  XIX  Then say since nature's high behest appears  That living forms should change of being prove  In which new joy the novel scene endears  New objects rise to please new wings to move  Since man too taught by sage experience knows  His frame revolving treads life's varying stage  That the manplant first vegetating grows  Then sense directs then reason rules in age  Say is it strange should death's alldreaded hour  Waft to some unknown scenes or wake some untried pow'r  XX  The wise Creator wrapt in fleshly veil  The ray divine the pure aetherial mate  Tho' worn by age the brittle fabric fail  The smiling soul survives the frowns of fate  Each circling year each quickrevolving day  Touches with mould'ring tooth thy flitting frame  With furtive slight repairs th' unseen decay  For ever changing yet in change the same  Oft hast thou dropt unhurt thy mortal part  Dare the grim terror then nor dread his guiltless dart  XXI  The twinkling eye whose varioushumour'd round  Takes in soft net th' inverted form behind  The list'ning ears that catch the waving sound  Are but mere organs of the feeling mind  External matter thus can lend its aid  And distant shapes with foreign pow'r supply  Thus the long tube by  Galiloeo  made  Brings home the wonders of the peopled sky  The pow'r percipient then feels no decay  Tho' blind the tube and darkness blot the visual ray  XXII  When lock'd in short suspence by sleep's soft pow'r  In temporary death the senses lie  When solemn silence reigns at midnight hour  Deaf the dull ear and clos'd the curtain'd eye  Objects of sense each conscious sense asleep  With lively image strike the wakeful soul  Some frowning rock that threats the foaming deep  Or woodhung vale where streams maeand'ring roll  Some longlost friend's returning voice you hear  Clasp the lifepictur'd shade and drop the pleasing tear  XXIII  Each outward organ as ideas rise  Gives easy entrance to the motley train  Reflection  calm with retrospective eyes  Surveys her treasures in the formful brain  Tho' Death relentless shed his baleful dew  In Lethe dip each formconveying pow'r  Unhurt Reflection may her themes pursue  Smile at the ruin safe amidst her store  Without one sense's aid in life's low vale  Fancy can furnish joys and reason lift her scale  XXIV  Thus the lone lover in the pensive shade  In daydreams rapt of soft ecstatic bliss  Pursues in thought the visionary maid  Feasts on the fancy'd smile and favour'd kiss  Thus the young poet at the close of day  Led by the magic of some fairy song  Thro' the dun umbrage winds his heedless way  Nor hears the babbling brook that brawls along  Thus deathless  Newton  deaf to nature's cries  Would measure  Time  and  Space  and travel 'round the skies  XXV  When just expiring hangs life's trembling light  And fell disease strikes deep the deadly dart  Reason and mem'ry burn with ardour bright  And gen'rous passions warm the throbbing heart  Oft will the vig'rous soul in life's last stage  With keenest relish taste pure mental joys  Since the fierce efforts of distemper's rage  Nor 'bates her vigour nor her pow'rs destroys  Say shall her lustre death itself impair  When in high noon she rides then sets in dark despair  XXVI  Tho' through the heart no purple tide should flow  No quiv'ring nerve should vibrate to the brain  The mental pow'rs no mean dependence know  Thought may survive and each fair passion reign  As when  Lucina  ends the pangful strife  Lifts the young babe and lights her lambent flame  Some pow'rs newwaking hail the dawning life  Some unsuspended live unchang'd the same  So from our dust fresh faculties may bloom  Some posthumous survive and triumph o'er the tomb  XXVII  This fibrous frame by nature's kindly law  Which gives each joy to keen sensation here  O'er purer scenes of bliss the veil may draw  And cloud reflection's more exalted sphere  When Death's cold hand with alldissolving pow'r  Shall the close tie with friendly stroke unbind  Alike our mortal as our natal hour  May to new being raise the waking mind  On death's new genial day the soul may rise  Born to some higher life and hail some brighter skies  XXVIII  The mossgrown tree that shrinks with rolling years  The drooping flow'rs that die so soon away  Let not thy heart alarm with boding fears  Nor thy own ruin date from their decay  The blushing rose that breathes the balmy dew  No pleasing transports of perception knows  The rev'rend oak that circling springs renew  Thinks not nor by long age experienc'd grows  Thy fate and theirs confess no kindred tic  Tho' their frail forms may fade shall sense and reason die  XXIX  Nor let life's ills that in dire circle rage  Steal from thy heaving breast those labour'd sighs  These the kind tutors of thy infant age  Train the young pupil for the future skies  Unschool'd in early prime in riper years  Wretched and scorn'd still struts the bearded boy  The tingling rod bedew'd with briny tears  Shoots forth in graceful fruits of manly joy  The painful cares that vex the toilsom spring  Shall plenteous crops of bliss in life's last harvest bring  XXX  She ceas'd and vanish'd into sightless wind  O'er my torn breast alternate passions sway  Now Doubt desponding damps the wav'ring mind  Now Hope reviving sheds her chearful ray  Soon from the skies in heav'nly white array'd  Faith  to my sight reveal'd fair Cherub stood  With life replete the volume she display'd  Seal'd with the ruddy stains of crimson blood  Each fear now starts away as spectres fly  When the sun's orient beam first gilds the purple sky  XXXI  Mean while the faithful herald of the day  The village cock crows loud with trumpet shrill  The warbling lark soars high and morning grey  Lifts her glad forehead o'er the cloudwrapt hill  Nature's wild music fills the vocal vale  The bleating flocks that bite the dewy ground  The lowing herds that graze the woodland dale  And cavern'd echo swell the chearful sound  Homeward I bend with clear unclouded mind  Mix with the busy world and leave each care behind  To the Memory of a GENTLEMAN who died on his Travels to ROME  Written in  By the Rev Dr

of an Epistle of HORACE  By the Rev Mr S of Magdalen College OXFORD  TIME fliesso you and Horace sing  From whence you many a moral bring  To teach us how to steer our lives  T' enjoy our bottles and our wives  Young man I well approve your notions  And wholly am at your devotions  I hate your sour canting rascals  That talk of Emberweeks and Pascals  Black villains who desire to wean us  From Bacchus' pleasures and from Venus'  To gain themselves a larger share  And fob us off with fast and prayer  And tell us none to Elysium go  Who do not plague themselves below  Can mis'ry raise the grateful heart  Or tuneful songs of praise impart  The great Creator's work we view  And trace it out by Wisdom's clue  Nothing is  good  but what is  true  With cautious and with thankful eye  We scan the great variety  Each  good  within our reach we taste  And call our neighbour to the feast  Our souls do gen'rously disown  All pleasure that's confin'd to one  The only rational employment  Is to receive and give enjoyment  To ev'ry pleasure we attend  Not to enjoy is to offend  But still amidst the various crowd  Of  goods  that call with voices loud  Our nat'ral genius education  Parents companions or our station  Direct us to some  single choice  In which we chiefly must rejoice  Pleasures are ladiessome we court  To pass away an hour in sport  We like them all for this or that  For silence some and some for chat  For ev'ry one as Cowley sings  Or arrows yields or bows or strings  But after all this rambling life  Each man must have his proper  wife  You know my meaningsome  one good  Felt heard or seen or understood  Will captivate the heart's affection  And bring the rest into subjection  Pray mind the tenor of my song  It holds together tho' 'tis long

various times in various places  In crowded street of Arlington  Where slaves of hope to levées run  A promise signifies no more  Than in the chamber of a whore  And when the good deceiv'd Sir  Francis  With  madam  up from Yorkshire dances  To claim the great man's promise given  Some six years since or some say seven  No one can blame that curious writer  That says they'll both return the lighter  But can we hence affirm that no miss  Of all the sex can keep a promise  Or say from what our courtier speaks  That all men's faiths are wafercakes  That courts make rogues is my belief  As 'tis the mill that makes the thief  But 'cause one limb is none o' th' best  Shall I for that cut off the rest  Sure it may be with safety said  A parson's promise duely made  Beneath a prelate's holy roof  Must stand 'gainst all assaults a proof  Yet he who thinks the church mistaken  May find himself in time mistaken  I know the man and grieve to say't  Who so did failand that was S  And can we then no more depend on  Our good forgetful friend at Findon  Than on a courtier promiseful  Or a whore's oath to cheat her cull  Can S no better promise keep  If that were trueI e'en shou'd weep  In Sarum's town when last we met  I told you 'mongst much other prate  That my design was to withdraw  And leave the craggy paths of  law  And as the skilful pilot steers  Wide of the dreadful rocks he fears  And in the safer ocean rides  Nor fears his vessel's bulging sides  So I from Coke's and Croke's reports  And special pleadings of the courts  Had veer'd about to bury dead  And 'gainst a pulpit run my head  Didst thou not promise then and there  But promises are chinaware  Didst thou not promise as I spoke  That you'd ere long your Muse invoke  And cloath'd in strong harmonious line  Send counsel to the young divine  Where of thy word then is the troth  Which I thought good as any oath  Or where that strong harmonious line  Bless'd by each sister of the Nine  That whore we spake of i' th' beginning  Hath some excuse to make for sinning  Her tongue and tail are taught deceit  From her not knowing where to eat  The courtier too hath some excuse  To think wordbreaking small abuse  And 'midst the hurry noise and bustle  Of crowds that at his levée jostle  No man can be in such a taking  To see a little promisebreaking  But what indulgence what excuse  Can plead for thee or for thy Muse  For thee on whom the sisters wait  Pleas'd with the talk impos'd by S  Whom at his christ'ning they did dip  O'er head and ears in Aganip  For thee at mention of whose strain  Their winged courser courts the rein  Bounds e'en through Sussexroads along  Proud of the burthen of thy song  Answer to the foregoing  By J S  MY dearest boy  Apollo's and the prelate's joy  You sharp rebuke came safe to hand  And speedy answer does demand  Your charge me homeour conscious Muse  Wou'd fain say something in excuse  The promise made must be confess'd  But here Sir  distinguendum est  A promise  broke  and one  delay'd  Differ as much as light and shade  By this distinction all your whores  And courtiers I turn out of doors  And by induction logical  Prove they affect not me at all  But if my logic be not good  I'll prove it from the word of God  Which serves to clear all sorts of cases  And wears a masquerade of faces  When bloodyminded Jephtha swore  If he return'd a conqueror  He'd offer up in sacrifice  What from his house first met his eyes  And when his girl and only child  Hasten'd to welcome from the field  With pious joy her prosp'rous sire  Gaily dancing to the lyre  The holy butcher understood  His promise's performance good  Tho' for a year the virgin stray'd  And wept her unlost maidenhead  Thus Sir you see we men of letters  Can like Jack Shepherd cut our fetters  When pinch'd we file scholastic saw  And iron is no more than straw  The man is thought to have no brains  Who can't break loose or bind in chains  Your  Sykes's  and your  Waterlands  Have nothing else upon their hands  They stand prepar'd with double tackle  To fix or to remove the shackle  But my dear boy we'll only tye  The silken bands of amity  Or such as hocktide boys and misses  With laughter bind and harmless kisses  Indulge the free poetic measure  And mimic discord for more pleasure  But after all these long preambles  In which our nag at best but ambles  After our plea of mere delay  'Tis fit we think our debt to pay  Soon then as business will permit  We'll send you up another sheet  Full fraught with our most learn'd advice  In which we must be somewhat nice  We'll rouse our thoughts and take due time  And trifle not in dogrel rhyme  But boldly whip the winged steed  And raise him to a nobler speed  Quod dignum tanto feret hic promissor hiatu  By the Same  ADAM alone cou'd not be easy  So he must have a wife an't please ye  But how did he procure this wife  To chear his solitary life  Why from a rib cut off his side  Was form'd this necessary bride  But how did he the pain beguile  Pho he slept sweetly all the while  But when this rib was reapplied  In woman's form to Adam's side  How then I pray you did it answer  He never slept so sweet again Sir  CUPID and CHLOE  By the Same  TO deck her bosom Chloe chose  Before all flow'rs the blushing rose  It made her breasts more lovely shew  And added whiteness to their snow  The tender nymph herself a bud  So much already understood  But once bless'd hour she went to see  The produce of the favourite tree  A large and tempting rose she found  Which spread its perfumes all around  It seem'd to court the virgin's hand  The virgin did not long withstand  She pluck'dbut O a sudden pain  Made her release the stalk again  The wound appear'd her finger bled  And stain'd the rose with guilty red  The nymph with pain and anger mov'd  Began to hate what once she lov'd  She sighed she wept and stamp'd and swore  She'd touch the odious tree no more  When forth a little Cupid came  T' appease the crying angry dame  The angry nymph the God perceives  Struggling through th' intangling leaves  When from his fragrant ambuscade  He thus accosts the weeping maid  Cease Chloe cease and do not cry  Nor blame the harmless tree'twas I  'Twas I that caus'd the little pain  And Iwill make it well again  My mother bad me do't and said  This herb would ease the sust'ring maid  Let it but to the place

Same  WONDER not faithless woman if you see  Yourself so chang'd so great a change in me  With shame I own it I was once your slave  Ador'd myself the beauties which I gave  Nor know deceiv'd deceitful that 'twas I  Gave thy form grace and lustre to thine eye  Thy tongue thy fingers I their magic taught  And spread the net in which myself was caught  So pagan priests first form and dress the wood  Then prostrate fall before the senseless God  But now curst woman thy last sentence hear  I call'd thy beauty forth I bid it disappear  I'll strip thee of thy borrow'd plumes undress  And shew thee in thy native ugliness  Those eyes have shone by me by me that chin  The seat of wanton Cupids long has been  Ye fires go outye wanton Cupids fly  Of ev'ry beam disarm her haggard eye  'Tis

flowers tho' fragrant she panted for ease  II  The stream it was fickle and hasted away  It kiss'd the sweet banks but no longer cou'd stay  Tho' beauteous inconstant and faithless tho' fair  Ah Colin look in and behold thyself there  III  The breeze that so sweet on its bosom did play  Now rose to a tempest and darken'd the day  As sweet as the breeze and as loud as the wind  Such Colin when angry and Colin when kind  IV  The flowers when gather'd so beauteous and sweet  Now fade on her bosom and die at her feet  So fair in their bloom and so soul in decay  Such Colin when present and Colin away  V  In rage and despair from the ground she arose  And from her the flowers so faded the throws  She weeps in the stream and she sighs to the wind  And resolves to drive Colin quite out of her mind  VI  But what her resolves when her Colin appear'd  The stream it stood still and no tempest was hear'd  The flowers recover'd their beautiful hue  She found he was kind and believ'd he was true

fine Cloaths at a Ball  By Mr W TAYLOR  HAPPY the worms that spun their lives away  T' enrich the splendor of this glorious day  Well pleas'd these gen'rous foreigners expire  A sacrifice to Beauty's general fire  Oh had they seen with what superior grace  Beauty here triumphs in each lovely face  Their am'rous flames had their own work betray'd  And burn'd the web their curious art had made  Another on the same Subject written with more Judgment but fewer good Manners  By the Same  HOW strangely doth the pow'r of custom rule  And prejudice our wisest thoughts controul  How does one country with contempt deride  What other nations count their chiefest pride  Our European ladies think they're fine  When in the entrails of a worm they shine  Yet laugh to see conceited Hottentots  Grow vain tho' shining in far nobler guts  In turgid pomp their strutting limbs are deck'd  And unctuous splendour from their robes reflect  The balmy gloss which on the surface shines  Regales the smell and smooths the ladies' skins  Richly yet wisely dress'd for of the cost  They suffer not a remnant to be lost  But eat each tatter as it wears away  And sup upon the fragments of the day  Frugal of time at once they' undress and feed  Gnaw off their cloaths and put themselves to bed  Their wedding garments prove their wedding feasts  And the bride's fin'ry entertains the guests  The eager bridegroom surfeits on her charms  And fills his belly as he fills his arms  Justly may they condemn our foolish pride  Who only for the naked back provide  And useless garments to the dunghill cast  Before they've through the hungry stomach pass'd  Who well might purchase had we their good sense  Both food and raiment at the same expence  When will our wives and daughters be so good  Thus to convert their old cloaths into food  The BREWER's Coachman  By the Same  HONEST William an easy and goodnatur'd fellow  Wou'd a little too oft get a little too mellow  Body coachman was he to an eminent brewer  No better e'er sat in a box to be sure  His coach was kept clean and no mothers or nurses  Took that care of their babes that he took of his horses  He had theseay and fifty good qualities more  But the business of  tipling  cou'd ne'er be got o'er  So his master effectually mended the matter  By hiring a man who drank nothing but water  Now William says he you see the plain case  Had you drunk as he does you'd kept a good place  Drink water quoth Williamhad all men done so  You'd never have wanted a coachman I trow  They're soakers like me whom you load with reproaches  That enable you brewers to ride in your coaches  FEMALE CAUTION  By the Same  MOTHER Breedwell presented her husband each year  With a chopping brave boy sometimes with a pair  'Till the primitive blessing of multiplication  Had fill'd the whole house with a young generation  But as they increas'd so sorrow and care  Those primitive curses put in for a share  And the toilsome employment of mother and wife  Had hag'd the poor woman half out of her life  To the doctor she goes with a pitiful face  And begs he wou'd give his advice in her case  She tells him her husband was wretchedly poor  And prays he'd consider her chargeable store  And prevent for the future her having of more  As for that quoth the sage I've a cure never failing  Which neither Hippocrates thought of nor Galen  Look hereI present you this wonderful hose  Into which ev'ry night when you bed with your spouse  Thrust both legs nor pull off the magical fetters  Till you rise in the morn about family matters  Observe but this rule which I give you in charge  And your stock may diminish but never enlarge  Many thanks for your kindness dear Sir quoth the  dame  Here she drop'd him a curt'sieif it were not for shame  And for fear you shou'd think me too bold I'd fain beg  T' other stockingand so have a hose to each leg  For if such rare virtue contain'd is in one  How safe shou'd I be had I both of them on  ORTHODOX ADVICE  By the Same  QUOTH John to his teacher good Sir if you please  I wou'd beg your advice in a difficult case  'Tis a weighty concern that may hold one for life  'Tis in short the old story of taking a wife  There's a pair of young damsels I'm proffer'd to marry  And whether to choose puts me in a quandary  They're alike in age family fortune and feature  Only one has more  grace  and the other  goodnature  As for that says the teacher goodnature and love  And sweetness of temper are gifts from above  And as coming from thence we shou'd give 'em their due  Grace  is a superior blessing 'tis true  Ay Sir I remember an excellent sarment  Wherein all along you gave  grace  the preferment  I shall never forget it as how you were telling  That heaven resided where grace had its dwelling  Why John quoth the teacher that's true but alas  What heaven can do is quite out of the case  For by day and by night with the woman you wed  'Tis you that must board and 'tis you that must bed  And a  goodnatur'd  girl may quickly grow  gracious  But a sourheaded saint will be ever vexatious  HULL ALE  By the Same  LONG time did a silly old proverb prevail  That meat drink and cloth were all sound in good ale  'Till a lover of truth went on purpose to Hull  And to try an experiment drank his skin full  He began to see visions his head it turn'd round  'Till off from his keffal he fell on the ground  There in trances profound our philosopher mellow  Lay all night in the snow consulting his pillow  Oracular vapours give prophecy birth  As Plutarch reports springing out of the earth  Whether this was the cause or however inspir'd  Our sage gave a sentence will be ever admir'd  'Twas thisI pronounce that good ale is good  meat  For I find I have no inclination to eat  That good ale is good  cloth  you may honestly boast  For i'faith I'm as blithe and as warm as a toast  But to call it good  drink  is a lye I'll be sworn  For I ne'er was so  dry  since the hour I was born  The  cloth  cries a punster who chanc'd to come by  Must be a good  drap  if it kept you so  dry  EPIGRAM  By the Same  IT blew an hard storm and in utmost confusion  The sailors all hurried to get absolution  Which done and the weight of the sins they'd confess'd  Were transfer'd as they thought from themselves to the priest  To lighten the ship and conclude their devotion  They toss'd the poor parson souse into the ocean  ANOTHER  A Drunken old Scot by the rigorous sentence  Of the kirk was condemn'd to the stool of repentance  Mess John to his conscience his vices put home  And his

summer's rage defeat  There stands a country parson's calm retreat  View well the silent shade with sober eye  And wonder at the courtier's swolen luxury  II  See to his garden's pale where close ally'd  A decent church the neighbouring glebe commands  Whose steeple's stock'd with bells the country's pride  Whose beams are wreath'd about with virgin bands  Wove on the bridal day by virgin hands  The surplice clean and chancel newly whited  That with the good man's neatness all must be delighted  III  His house stands near this church's younger brother  Whose furniture shews housewifely and neat  A little garden runs from one to t'other  Stately in use excluding useless state  In which a yew tree stands of ancient date  And near it rosemary climbs up the wall  Or else imperfect were the rites of funeral  IV  Him liveth near in gentle neighbourhood  An heartsome friend replete with bounteous love  Whose generous wine long time hath corked stood  Not to avoid the taste but to improve  With him the good man's moments softly move  Nor yet compleat if I shou'd leave untold  The dame who of his joys sweet partnership doth hold  V  Well knows she when to govern when obey  Vers'd in the rights and laws of womanhood  Nor hath she too much wisdom to be gay  Nor hath she so much wit to be o'erloud  Nor hath she so much beauty to be proud  But chearful sense and decent mirth impart  The sweet domestic joys of a wellnatur'd heart  VI  Eight years hath heav'n possess'd them of a boy  Who loves a sister younger by a year  And as they prank about with silent joy  They sit and smile upon the prattling pair  Who two sweet roses on one stalk appear  And think upon themselves once fair and young  Before soft Cupid's golden bow became unstrung  VII  Each sun arises fresh with sweet content  And leads them on a course of new delight  With the same joy the summer's day is spent  And o'er a chearful fire their winter night  Such are their joys who spend their lives aright  Tho' seasons change no sense of change they know  But with an equal eye view all things here below  VIII  When th' amorous earth is woo'd with smiling weather  To wear the verdant mantle of the spring  Forth walk the little family together  To see the wood and hear its natives sing  The flow'rs sweet odours to their senses bring  The world appears in blossom far and near  Joyful they view the purple promise of the year  IX  Summer beholds the good man near his bride  In sweet contentment smoking in his chair  He views the flocks nibbling the mountain's side  And ev'ry tenth he reckons to his share  Now to the hay field walk the happy pair  And with such kindness greet the country folk  The parson's bush is plac'd upon the biggest cock  X  The promis'd fruit now fills the teeming soil  And certain plenty all his doubts relieves  The peach he planted pays his honest toil  The farmer brings him home his yellow sheaves  And his stuff'd barn the willing tax receives  His servants to his loaded orchards hye  To lay in liquid stores for future jollity  XI  When icy bands the stiffened wave enfold  Still is the parson with contentment crown'd  The chearful blaze chaces the chilly cold  In circling cups all winter thoughts are drown'd  And no ill nature sends the laugh around  Or in his study pent thinks what to say  May touch yet not offend the squire next sabbath day  XII  Thus still in age the same he journeys on  Till envious Fate o'ertakes him on the road  For the calm pleasures of the holy man  Claim not the madness of a youthful blood  For many winters thus serenely stood  Strong in its smooth decline the sturdy oak  Till came from heav'n th' unfear'd and unresisted stroke  PLAIN TRUTH  By HENRY FIELDING  Esq  AS Bathian Venus t'other day  Invited all the Gods to tea  Her maids of honour the miss Graces  Attending duely in their places  Their godships gave a loose to mirth  As we at Butt'ring's here on earth  Minerva in her usual way  Raillied the daughter of the sea  Madam said she your lov'd resort  The city where you hold your court  Is lately fallen from its duty  And triumphs more in wit than beauty  For here she cried see here a poem  'Tis Dalston's you Apollo know him  Little persuasion sure invites  Pallas to read what Dalston writes  Nay I have heard that in Parnassus  For truth a current whisper passes  That Dalston sometimes has been known  To publish her words as his own  Minerva read and every God  Approv'dJove gave the critic nod  Apollo and the sacred Nine  Were charm'd and smil'd at ev'ry line  And Mars who little understood  Swore dn him if it was not good  Venus alone sat all the while  Silent nor deign'd a single smile  All were surpriz'd some thought her stupid  Not so her consident 'squire Cupid  For well the little rogue discern'd  At what his mother was concern'd  Yet not a word the urchin said  But hid in Hebe's lap his head  At length the rising choler broke  From Venus' lipsand thus she spoke  That poetry so cram'd with wit  Minerva shou'd your palate hit  I wonder not nor that some prudes  For such there are above the clouds  Shou'd wish the prize of beauty torn  From her they view with envious scorn  Me poets never please but when  Justice and truth direct their pen  This Dalstonformerly I've known him  Henceforth for ever I disown him  For Homer's wit shall I despise  In him who writes with Homer's eyes  A poem on the fairest fair  At Bath and Betty's name not there  Hath not this poet seen those glances  In which my wicked urchin dances  Nor that dear dimple where he treats  Himself with all Arabia's sweets  In whose soft down while he reposes  In vain the lillies bloom or roses  To tempt him from a sweeter bed  Of fairer white or livelier red  Hath he not seen when some kind gale  Has blown aside the cambric veil  That seat of paradise where Jove  Might pamper his almighty love  Our milky way less fair does shew  There summer's seen 'twixt hills of snow  From her lov'd voice whene'er she speaks  What softness in each accent breaks  And when her dimpled smiles arise  What sweetness sparkles in her eyes  Can I then bear enrag'd she said  Slights offer'd to my fav'rite maid  The nymph whom I decreed to be  The representative of me  The Goddess ceas'dthe Gods all bow'd  Nor one the wicked bard avow'd  Who while in beauty's praise he writ  Dar'd Beauty's Goddess to omit  For now their godships recollected  'Twas Venus' self he had neglected  Who in her visits to this place  Had still worn Betty Dalston's face  Ode to Venus from her Votaries of the Street  By * * * * *  ARE these thy palms oh queen of love  Pity thy wretched votaries From above  Behold them stroll their bosoms bare  Chill'd with the blasts of rude St Clement's air  And twitch the sleeve with sly advance  Roll the bright eye or shoot the sidelong glance  Whilst the chaste moon with envious light  Peeps thro' the curtain of the freezing night  Not thus when Horace hymn'd thy praise  You heard the Glyceras of happier days  Oh Goddess os love's pleasing pain  From thy own isle avert the frost and rain  Nor let the little mouth inhale  Bane to the teeth a rough unfriendly gale  Or slender ancle white and neat  Betray a splash from the polluted street  Look down with pity on the woes  That trace our footsteps and our haunts enclose  For thee we forfeit fair renown  Brave want and danger orphans of the town  For thee sustain the cruel shock  Of caustic Franks and cicatrizing Rock  Happy if Hermes' timely care  The searching deity of here and there  Can soften the venereal doom  And keep awhile pale beauty from the tomb  But languid lifeless cold and bare  Gone ev'ry tooth and fallen ev'ry hair  A prey to grief remorse disease  Ah Paphian Venus faithless as the seas  Fir'd by thy spells and magic charms  We guiltless virgins glow'd at soft alarms  Embark'd with youth and airy smiles  The graces playful loves and wanton wiles  On pleasure's wave we loos'd the sails  Alas too credulous of flatt'ring gales  For lo the heav'ns with clouds are spread  The graces loves with youth are fled  And leave the ship an easy prize  Unrigg'd and leaky to th' inclement skies  An EPIGRAM  By the same  I Dropt a thing in verse without a name  I felt no censure and I gain'd no fame  The public saw the bastard in the cradle  But ne'er enquir'd so left it to the beadle  A certain nobleman takes up the child  The real father lay perdue and smil'd  The public now enlarges every grace  What shining eyes it has how fair a face  Of parts what symmetry what strength divine  The noble brat is sure of Pelops' line  The POET's IMPORTANCE  By Dr H * * *  THE glowworm scribblers of a feeble age  Pale twinklers of an hour provoke my rage  In each dark hedge we start an insect fire  Which lives by night and must at dawn expire  Yet such their number that their specks combine  And the unthinking vulgar swear they shine  Poets are prodigies so greatly rare  They seem the tasks of heav'n and built with care  Like suns unquench'd unrival'd and sublime  They roll immortal o'er the wastes of time  Ages in vain close round and snatch in fame  High over all still shines the Poet's name  Lords of a life that scorns the bounds of breath  They stretch existence and defy stern death  Glory and shame are theirsthey plant renown  Or shade the Monarch's by the Muse's crown  To say Augustus reign'd when Virgil shin'd  Does honour to the lord of half mankind  So when three thousand years have wan'd away  And POPE is said t' have liv'd when GEORGE bore sway  Millions shall

mountain snows are all dissolv'd  And hush'd the blushing gale  While fragrant Zephyrs gently breathe  Along the flowery vale  The circling planets' constant round  The wintry wastes repair  And still from temporary death  Renew the verdant year  But ah when once our transient bloom  The spring of life is o'er  That rosy season takes its flight  And must return no more  Yet judge by Reason's sober rules  From false Opinion free  And mark how little pilfering years  Can steal from you or me  Each moral pleasure of the heart  Each smiling charm of truth  Depends not on the giddy bud  Of wild fantastic youth  The vain coquet whose empty pride  A fading face supplies  May justly dread the wintry gloom  Where all its glory dies  Leave such a ruin to deplore  To fleeting forms confin'd  Nor age nor wrinkles discompose  One feature of the mind  Amidst the universal change  Unconscious of decay  It views unmov'd the scythe of Time  Sweep all besides away  Fix'd on its own eternal frame  Eternal are its joys  While borne on transitory wings  Each mortal pleasure flies  While every shortliv'd flower of sense  Destructive years consume  Through friendship's fair enchanting walks  Unfading myrtles bloom  Nor with the narrow bounds of time  Its beauteous prospect ends  But lengthen'd through the vale of death  To paradise extends  ODE to SPRING  By Miss F  HAIL genial goddess blooming Spring  Thy blest return O let me sing  And aid my languid lays  Let  me  not sink in sloth supine  While all creation at thy shrine  Its annual tribute pays  II  Escap'd from Winter's freezing power  Each blossom greets thee and each flower  And foremost of the train  By Nature artless handmaid drest  The snowdrop comes in lilly'd vest  Prophetic of thy reign  III  The lark now strains his warbling throat  While every loud and sprightly note  Calls Echo from her cell  Be warn'd ye fair that listen round  A beauteous maid became a sound  A maid who lov'd too well  IV  The brighthair'd sun with warmth benign  Bids tree and shrub and swelling vine  Their infantbuds display  Again the streams refresh the plains  Which Winter bound in icy chains  And sparkling bless his ray  V  Lifegiving Zephyrs breathe around  And instant glows th' enamel'd ground  With Nature's vary'd hues  Not so returns our youth decay'd  Alas nor air nor sun nor shade  The spring of life renews  VI  The sun's too quickrevolving beam  Will soon dissolve the human dream  And bring th' appointed hour  Too late we catch his parting ray  And mourn the idlywasted day  No longer in our power  VII  Then happiest he whose lengthen'd sight  Pursues by virtue's constant light  A hope beyond the skies  Where frowning Winter ne'er shall come  But rosy Spring for ever bloom  And suns eternal rise  ODE to CYNTHIA  By the Same  SISTER of Phoebus gentle Queen  Of aspect mild and brow serene  Whose friendly beams by night appear  The lonely traveller to chear  Attractive power whose mighty sway  The ocean's swelling waves obey  And mounting upward seem to raise  A liquid altar to thy praise  Thee wither'd hags at midnight hour  Invoke to their infernal bower  But I to no such horrid rite  Sweet Queen implore thy sacred light  Nor seek while all but lovers sleep  To rob the miser's treasur'd heap  Thy kindly beams alone impart  To find the youth who stole my heart  And guide me from thy silver throne  To steal  his  heart or find  my own  ODE to a THRUSH  By Miss P * * *  SWEET warbler to whose artless song  Soft Music's native powers belong  Here fix thy haunt and o'er these plains  Still pour thy wild untutor'd strains  Still hail the morn with sprightly lay  And sweetly hymn the parting day  But sprightlier still and sweeter pour  Thy song o'er Flavia's favorite bower  There softly breathe the vary'd sound  And chant thy loves or woes around  So may'st thou live securely blest  And no rude storms disturb thy nest  No birdlime twig or gin annoy  Or cruel gun thy brood destroy  No want of shelter may'st thou know  Which Ripton's lofty shades bestow  No dearth of winter berries fear  But haws and hips blush half the year  ELEGY  I  AH me that restless bliss so soon should flie  Still as I think my yielding maid to gain  And flatt'ring hope says all my joys are nigh  Officious jealousy renews my pain  II  When cold suspense and torturing despair  When pausing doubt and anxious fear's no more  Some idle falshood haunts my list'ning ear  And wakes my heart to all it felt before  III  One treads the mazes of the puzzled dance  With easy step and unaffected air  False rapture feigns or rolls a meaning glance  To catch the open easyhearted fair  IV  Another boasts a more substantial claim  For him fair Plenty fills her golden horn  A thousand flocks support his haughty flame  A thousand acres crown'd with waving corn  V  But I nor tread the mazes of the dance  With easy step and unaffected air  Nor rapture feign nor roll a meaning glance  To catch the open easyhearted fair  VI  I boast not Fortune's more substantial claim  For me nor Plenty fills her golden horn  Nor wealthy flocks support my humble flame  Nor smiling acres crown'd with waving corn  VII  Say will thy gen'rous heart for these reject  A tender passion and a soul sincere  For tho' with me you have little to expect  Believe me Sylvia you have less to fear  VIII  Come let us tread the flow'ry paths of peace  'Till Fate shall seal th' irrevocable doom  Then soar together to yon realms of bliss  And leave our mingled ashes in the tomb  IX  Perhaps some tender sympathetic breast  Who knows with Sorrow's elegance to moan  May search the charnel where our relicks rest  And grave our mem'ry on the faithful stone  X  "Tread soft ye lovers o'er this hallow'd ground  "Here lies fond Damon by his Sylvia's side  "Their souls in life by mutual love were bound  "Nor death the lasting union could divide"  A POEM to the Memory of THOMAS late Marquiss of WHARTON Lord Privy Seal  VAIN are these pomps thy funeral rites to grace  And blazon forth thy long  Patrician  race  These banners mark'd with boasted feats of old  And streamers waving with distinguish'd gold  Proud hieroglyphics where are darkly shown  Thy brave forefathers merits not thy own  Herald forbear these painted honours give  To names that only in thy paint can live  Thy colours fade near this illustrious clay  And all thy gaudy gildings die away  See  The marquiss was inter'd at Winchindon on the d of April The total eclipse of the sun happening whilst his remains were on the road stopped the procession  heaven displeas'd thy fond attempt upbraids  And claims the province thy bold hand invades  Untimely darkness gathering round the skies  Blackens the morn to grace his obsequies  The sick'ning sun shines dim and in the sight  Of gazing crowds resigns his waning light  Mark how he labours with relapse of night  How his diminish'd face a crescent seems  Like Cynthia newly silver'd with his beams  But as in full eclipse his light expires  Back to its source our gelid blood retires  Chill'd with surprize our trembling joints unbrace  And pale confusion sits on every face  The bleating flocks no more the shepherd's care  Stray from those folds to which they wou'd repair  Home to his young the raven wings his way  And leaves untasted his yet bleeding prey  While tow'ring larks their rival notes prolong  They drop benighted in their morning song  Darkness and horror reign o'er earth and skies  And nature for awhile with WHARTON dies  O speak refulgent parent of the day  With beamy eye who dost the globe survey  Thou radiant source of wit's diviner fire  Thou truest judge of what thou dost inspire  Say hast thou seen in any age or clime  Since thy bright race began to measure time  So great a genius rise in ev'ry part  So form'd by nature finish'd so by art  Such manly sense with so much fire of mind  Judgement so strong to wit so lively join'd  No prepossession sway'd his equal soul  Steady to truth she pointed as her pole  Convinc'd of varying in the least degrees  Her pliant index she reclaim'd with ease  Early thro' custom's and prescription's yoke  Tyrants of weaker souls his reason broke  Good sense revering from the meanest hand  He durst authority in robes withstand  Determin'd always on maturer thought  Still by new reasons to new measures brought  Firm but not stubborn thoughtful not involv'd  Swift to perform what slowly he resolv'd  No tempests rag'd within his peaceful breast  Where kindling passion reason soon supprest  'Midst all events his firmness he maintain'd  Strugled with great but slighter ills disdain'd  Thus what philosophers could only preach  His inborn virtue did in practice reach  Nature design'd him master of address  None knew it more nor seem'd to know it less  It work'd like magic on your yielding heart  Sure was the charm but secret was the art  In human nature most exactly learn'd  The artful man he through his masque discern'd  With chosen baits that every temper take  He knew of knave or fool good use to make  His easy breeding free from form and rules  That stiffen the civility of fools  Of various turn for all occasions fit  Was squar'd with judgment and well touch'd with wit  Free of access from affectation clean  Great without pride nor when familiar mean  Obliging always with goodnatur'd sense  Nor apt to give nor apt to take offence  Nor fond when kind nor harsh when most severe  Betwixt extremes he justly knew to steer  In conversation wond'rous was his art  To guard his own and sift another's heart  To mirth and wit he led the chearful way  Reserv'dly open and discreetly gay  Nor could the softest hour his secret soul betray  Bright as the youngest as the oldest wise  In both extremes alike he gave surprize  In body active yet his sprightly mind  Within that body felt herself confin'd  When thoughts important claim'd no longer place  Then building planting and the speedy race  Paintings and books successive took their round  No blanks of time were in his journal found  Skill'd in the ends of his existence he  To be unuseful thought was not to be  Polite his taste of arts but vain was art  Where nature had so greatly done her part  Through tiresome mediums we at truth arrive  His easy knowledge seem'd intuitive  No copy'd beauties meanly form'd his mind  By heav'n a great original design'd  The seeds of science in his blood were sown  Born with philosophy 'twas all his own  The poet design'd by this to cover the marquiss's want of literature for he studied men and the world more than books  Nor bribes nor threat'nings could his zeal abate  To serve his country and avert her fate  Firm to her laws and liberties he stood  Submitting private views to public good  Who could obsequious with the current swim  Whigs might be call'd but tories were to him  Persons or parties he no longer knew  When swerving once from honest just and true  Oft has he stem'd the rage of impious times  When patriots virtues bore the brand of crimes  To check proud tyrants born and factions awe  But most devoted to good kings and law  Twice his dear country was on ruin's brink  Resolv'd to save her or with her to sink  His brave attempts successful twice he saw  Once in wise BRUNSWICK once in great NASSAU  No bolder champion in religion's cause  None fought more battles nor with more applause  To arms he flew as danger press'd her home  And snatched the hopeless prey from France and Rome  But as from conscience pure religion springs  He freedom press'd in unessential things  Coercive laws he rightly understood  Might make men hypocrites but never good  All genuine virtue is by nature free  And will when forc'd no longer virtue be  Who justly would his eloquence declare  Himself must WHARTON's fertile genius share  Would you conceive it see how o'er the sands  Fair Thames advances where Augusta stands  Gentle he flows but with resistless force  Not like the rapid Rhone's impetuous course  Tho' deep so clear are his transparent streams  His bottom rising to his surface seems  Full is his spreading current but restrain'd  And still within its flow'ry banks contain'd  Alternate wealth his two extremes unfold  Downwards he sends us bread and upwards gold  Flow sweetest river still thy course prolong  Thus deep and clear thus gentle full and strong  That distant ages may the image see  Of WHARTON's flowing eloquence in thee  So shall no torrents soil thy crystal stream  Thou patriot's emblem and thou poet's theme  Ye nobles who surround the British throne  Reflect its lustre and improve your own  You who resemble in rich robes of state  That majesty august on which you wait  Witness how often his decisive sense  His wit his art and copious eloquence  Have singly won the question to his side  Made Oxford blush and St John drop his pride  Whilst every ear was with his accents charm'd  As every breast was with his ardour warm'd  Faction was touch'd and felt the secret force  Dumb and convicted but without remorse  Envy with rage contending in her face  To see his triumph and her just disgrace  Nor less in council did his weight appear  The ablest statesman as the brightest peer  Thou mighty prince who from perfidious power  Didst speed to save us in a timely hour  Whilst beauty join'd with valour form'd thy train  To grace our court and raise our material vein  Whose rising beams made drooping Credit thrive  Religion spring fair Liberty revive  Say if thy chosen ministers who state  With thee to guide the great machine of state  A more consummate character could boast  Than that which Britain in her WHARTON lost  Oh had kind heaven if prayers were not too late  Another lustrum added to his date  How would his head his heart his hand conspire  To punish traitors as their crimes require  To crush rebellion bridle factions rage  And quell the monsters of an impious age  How would his bosom beat with joy to see  Great GEORGE the British legend true in thee  To see thee o'er the vanquish'd dragon ride  And free thy kingdoms from his rage and pride  Whilst peace and plenty spread their golden wings  Around the best of men the best of kings  And every tide shall waft into thy ports  Wealth from all lands and homage from all courts  But sov'reign heav'n whose ways are ever wise  He died a few months after the accession of GEORGE I  Just drew the glorious dawn before his eyes  And for his happier son reserv'd the sight  Of Brunswick's power in its meridian light  GEORGE shall in him prove honour courage truth  And find the father in the pregnant youth  Thus the great leader of the Hebrew bands  Through opening billows and o'er burning sands  From Egypt's yoke and haughty Pharaoh's chains  To Canaan's fruitful hills and flow'ry plains  From Pisgah's height the promis'd land descry'd  More was forbid he saw rejoic'd and dy'd  PARAPHRASE upon a FRENCH SONG  By the late WILLIAM SOMERVILE  Esq  Venge moy d'une ingrate maitresse  Dieu du vin j'implore bon yvresse  KIND relief in all my pain  Jolly Bacchus hear my pray'r  Vengeance on th'ingrateful fair  In thy smiling cordial bowl  Drown the sorrows of my soul  All thy deity employ  Gild each gloomy thought with joy  Jolly Bacchus save oh save  From the deep devouring grave  A poor despairing dying swain  Haste away  Haste away  Lash thy tigers do not stay  I'm undone if thou delay  If I view those eyes once more  Still shall love and still adore  And be more wretched than before  See the glory round her face  See her move  With what a grace  Ye Gods above  Is she not one of your immortal race  Fly ye winged Cupids fly  Dart like light'ning thro' the sky  Wou'd ye in marble temples dwell  The dear one to my arms compel  Bring her in bands of myrtle tied  Bid her forget and bid her hide  All her scorn and all her pride  Wou'd ye that yourslave repay  A smoking hecatomb each day  O restore  The beauteous Goddess I adore  O restore with all her charms  The faithless vagrant to my arms  THE TOMB of SHAKESPEAR A VISION  By JOHN GILBERT COOPER  Esq  WHAT time the jocund rosiebosom'd HOURS  Led forth the train of PHOEBUS and the SPRING  And ZEPHYR mild profusely scatter'd flowers  On Earth's green mantle from his musky wing  The MORN unbarr'd th' ambrosial gates of light  Westward the ravenpinion'd Darkness flew  The landscape smil'd in vernal beauty bright  And to their graves the sullen Ghosts withdrew  The nightingale no longer swell'd her throat  With lovelorn plainings tremulous and slow  And on the wings of Silence ceas'd to float  The gurgling notes of her melodious woe  The God of sleep mysterious visions led  In gay procession 'fore the mental eye  And my free'd soul awhile her mansion fled  To try her plumes for immortality  Thro' fields of air methought I took my flight  Thro' ev'ry clime o'er ev'ry region pass'd  No paradise or ruin 'scap'd my sight  HESPERIAN garden or CIMMERIAN waste  On AVON's banks I lit whose streams appear  To wind with eddies fond round SHAKESPEAR's tomb  The year's first feath'ry songsters warble near  And vi'lets breathe and earliest roses bloom  Here FANCY sat her dewy fingers cold  Decking with flow'rets fresh th' unsullied sod  And bath'd with tears the sad sepulchral mold  Her fav'rite offspring's long and last abode  Ah what avails she cry'd a Poet's name  Ah what avails th' immortalizing breath  To snatch from dumb Oblivion others' fame  My darling child here lies a prey to Death  Let gentle OTWAY whiterob'd PITY's priest  From grief domestic teach the tears to flow  Or SOUTHERN captivate th'impassion'd breast  With heartfelt sighs and sympathy of woe  For not to these  his  genius was confin'd  Nature and I each tuneful pow'r had given  Poetic transports of the madding mind  And the wing'd words that waft the soul to heaven  The fiery glance of th' intellectual eye  Piercing all objects of creation's store  Which on this world's extended surface lie  And plastic thought that still created more  O grant with eager rapture I reply'd  Grant me great goddess of the changeful eye  To view each Being in poetic pride  To whom thy son gave immortality  Sweet FANCY smil'd and wav'd her mystic rod  When strait these visions felt her pow'rful arm  And one by one succeeded at her nod  As vassal sprites obey the wizard's charm  First a celestial form  Ariel in the Tempest  of azure hue  Whose mantle bound with brede aetherial flow'd  To each soft breeze it's balmy breath that drew  Swift down the sunbeams of the noontide rode  Obedient to the necromantic sway  Of an old sage to solitude resign'd  With fenny vapors he obscur'd the day  Launch'd the long lightning and let loose the wind  He whirl'd the tempest thro' the howling air  Rattled the dreadful thunderclap on high  And rais'd roaring elemental war  Betwixt the seagreen waves and azure sky  Then like heav'n's mild embassador of love  To man repentant bade the tumult cease  Smooth'd the blue bosom of the realms above  And hush'd the rebel elements to peace  Unlike to this in spirit or in mien  Another form  Caliban in the Tempest  succeeded to my view  A twolegg'd brute which Nature made in spleen  Or from the loathing womb unfinish'd drew  Scarce cou'd he syllable the curse he thought  Prone were his eyes to earth his mind to evil  A carnal fiend to imperfection wrought  The mongrel offspring of a Witch and Devil  Next bloom'd upon an ancient forest's bound  The flow'ry margin  Fairyland from the Midsummer night's dream  of a silent stream  O'erarch'd by oaks with ivy mantled round  And gilt by silver CYNTHIA's maiden beam  On the green carpet of th' unbended grass  A dapper train of female fairies play'd  And ey'd their gambols in the watry glass  That smoothly stole along the shad'wy glade  Thro' these the queen TITANIA pass'd ador'd  Mounted aloft in her imperial car  Journeying to see great OBERON her lord  Wave the mock battles of a sportive war  Arm'd capapee forth march'd the fairy king  A stouter warrior never took the field  His threat'ning lance a hornet's horrid sting  The sharded beetle's scale his sable shield  Around their chief the elfin host appear'd  Each little helmet sparkled like a star  And their sharp spears in pierceless phalanx rear'd  A grove of thistles glitter'd in the air  The scene then chang'd from this romantic land  To a bleak waste by bound'ry unconfin'd  Where three swart sisters  The witches in Macbeth  of the  weïrd  band  Were mutt'ring curses to the troublous wind  Pale Want had wither'd every furrow'd face  Bow'd was each carcass with the weight of years  And each sunk eyeball from its hollow case  Distill'd cold rheum's involuntary tears  Hors'd on three staves they posted to the bourn  Of a drear island where the pendant brow  Of a rough rock shagg'd horribly with thorn  Frown'd on the boist'rous waves which rag'd below  Deep in a gloomy grot remote from day  Where smiling Comfort never shew'd her face  Where light ne'er enter'd save one rueful ray  Discov'ring all the terrors of the place  They held damn'd myst'ries with infernal state  Whilst ghastly spectres glided slowly by  The scritchowl scream'd the dying call of fate  And ravens croak'd their baleful augury  No human footstep chear'd the dread abode  Nor sign of living creature could be seen  Save where the reptile snake or sullen toad  The murky floor had soil'd with venom green  Sudden I heard the whirlwind's hollow sound  Each  weïrd  sister vanish'd into smoke  Now a dire yell of spirits  Ghosts in Macbeth Richard III c  underground  Thro' troubled Earth's wide yawning surface broke  When lo each injur'd apparition rose  Aghast the murd'rer started from his bed  Guilt's trembling breath his heart's red current froze  And Horror's dewdrops bath'd his frantic head  More had I seenbut now the God of day  O'er earth's broad breast his flood of light had spread  When Morpheus call'd his fickle dreams away  And on  their  wings each bright illusion fled  Yet still the dear ENCHANTRESS of the brain  My waking eyes with wishful wand'rings sought  Whose magic will controuls th' ideal train  The everrestless progeny of THOUGHT  Sweet pow'r I said for others gild the ray  Of Wealth or Honor's follyfeather'd crown  Or lead the madding multitude astray  To grasp at airblown bubbles of renown  Me humbler lot let blameless bliss engage  Free from the noble mob's ambitious strife  Free from the muckworm miser's lucrous rage  In calm Contentment's cottag'd vale of life  If frailties there for who from them is free  Thro' Error's maze my devious footsteps lead  Let them be frailties of humanity  And my heart plead the pardon of my head  Let not my reason impiously require  What heav'n has plac'd beyond it's narrow span  But teach it to subdue each fierce desire  Which wars within it's own small empire man  Teach me what all believe but few possess  That life's best science is ourselves to know  The first of human blessings is to bless  And happiest he who feels another's woe  Thus cheaply wise and innocently great  While Time's smooth sand shall regularly pass  Each destin'd atom's quiet course I'll wait  Nor rashly break nor wish to stop the glass  And when in death my peaceful ashes lie  If e'er some tongue congenial speaks my name  Friendship shall never blush to breathe a sigh  And great ones envy such an honest fame  ERRATA  Page Line  for  forget  read  forgot  Page Line  for  dark  read  dank  INDEX to the Fifth Volume
