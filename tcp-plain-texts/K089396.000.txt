and highly Influences the Oeconomy  of this World has naturally induc'd me to make an Humble Dedication to you of this Book The Subject is abstruse and treated of by few and that sparingly If I have more enlarg'd my self upon it it is that some extraordinary Visitations having happen'd to me in which I have had a Converse with those  Genii  I treat of have made so strong an Impression on my Mind that I could not well withhold my self from perusing the Best Authors I could meet with relating to it in Order to draw an Abstract of what I found most Material in them and to publish it together  with my own Experience and Thoughts in that kind as I have here done I treat of this Subject Historically Physiologically and Theologically tho' not in distinct Books but promiscuously as I found Occasion presented it self As for my Performance herein I could heartily wish it might prove to your Lordship's good liking and humbly submit it to your Lordship's Great Judgment and Censure being  My Lord  Your Lordship's Most Humble and Most Obedient Servant  John Beaumont  TO THE READER  HAving long promis'd the World this Book perhaps the Jocose part of Mankind may now be apt to say  Quid ferat hic tanto dignum promissor hiatu  Parturiunt montes  c  Be it as it may I have here made good my Promise and though I may not perswade my self that all Men will acquiesce in what I here deliver I not pretending in this Subject to Mathematical Demonstration  yet I shall be free to say That I fear no Man who shall pretend to bring more Reason for an Opinion contrary to that I assert and I believe whoever shall peruse this Book will find that I am not Ignorant of what Opposers of all kinds may take upon them to offer against it Indeed while we relie meerly on Reason in Subjects of this Nature I doubt we may have all too much cause to lament our selves with the Ingenious  Fracastorius  in  Ep ad Flaminium    Quid dicam miserum me agere quamducere vitam  Irrequietam animi quaerentem indagine vanâ  Naturam semper fugientem quae se ubi paulum  Ostendit mihi mox facies in milla repenté  Céu Proteus conversa sequentem eludit angit  Maerenten▪ seniíque horas cassumque laborem  Unhappy Man What can I say I do  How lead my Life thus restless to pursue  Still flying Nature which altho' by chance  May now and then present m' a little glance  Strait  Proteus  like in thousand shapes she's rest  So mocks my Toyle and frets my pensive Breast  We read of  Pentheus  that upon his getting upon a Tree and making himself a Spectator of the hidden Sacrifices of  Bacchus  he was struck with such a kind of fury that all things seem'd double to him two Suns and two  Thebes  presented themselves to his sight so that when he was hasting to  Thebes  presently seeing another  Thebes  he was drawn back and thus he was continually carryed to and fro in a restless Condition  Eumenidum veluti demens videt agmina Pentheus  Et solem geminum duplices se ostendere Thebas  As  Pentheus  maz'd whole Troops of Furies Spyes  Two Suns two  Thebes  presented to his Eyes  Now this Fable as the Lord  Bacon  tells us relates to  Divine Secrets  for those who forgetting frail Mortality rashly aspire to Divine Mysteries by high Flights in the Study of Nature and Philosophy as tho' they were mounted on a Tree have this for their Punishment that they are perplext with a perpetual inconstancy and wavering in Judgment for the Light of Nature being one thing and the Divine Light another it happens with them as though they saw two Suns and since the Actions of Life and the Decrees of the  Will depend of the Understanding it follows That they hesitate no less in their Wills than in Opinion and are altogether at variance with themselves and therefore they likewise see two  Thebes  for by  Thebes  which was the Habitation and retiring place of  Pentheus  the ends of our Actions are represented hence it happens that they know not which way to turn themselves but being uncertain and wavering as to the main of things they are Whirl'd about by sudden Impulses of Mind in every particular Matter and I believe that those that will not acquiesce in what we have delivered us in the Scriptures and by Christian Tradition concerning Spirits but will be medling in setting up other Hypotheses by their frail Reason for solving Facts commonly ascribed to Spirits will find their Judgment so perplext and brought into such a Labyrinth upon perusing what is here Written and that even setting by what I affirm from  my own Experience as to an Existence of Spirits and their Operations which I least rely on or urge as Argumentative that they will never be able to extricate themselves And upon this issue I leave it only adding this saying of the Learned Monsieur  le Clerc

Life  c  CHAP I What the Ancients understood the  Genii  that are said to attend Men to be as to their Nature and Offices  HAVING undertaken to write a Tract concerning the  Genii  that are said to attend Men during this Life I think it proper for me in the first place to set forth what according to the Ancients those  Genii  were understood to be as to their Nature and Offices  L de Dies Nat c    Censorinus  tells us that  Genius  is a God under whose Tuition each Man is born and lives and whether it be that he takes Care of our Generation or is engender'd with us or takes upon him our Guardianship after we are begotten he says he is called  Genius  from  Geno  an ancient Latin Word signifying to beget in lieu of which the Word  Gigno  is now us'd  Genius  is said to be Son of  Jupiter  and the  Earth  as being held to be of a middle Nature betwixt Gods and Men or for that he somewhat partakes of Body Some have thought our  Genius  to be the Symmetry of the Elements which preserves humane Bodies and all living Creatures Others the secret Power of the Celestial Bodies by which we are impell'd to do all things and these were call'd  Geruli  from  Gero  or  Ingero  that is from supporting us or suggesting good or bad Thoughts into our Minds  What the  Latins  call'd  Genius  the  Greeks  call'd  Daemon  which Word to pass by other Significations according to its Etymology signifies prudent knowing skilful in Affairs and foreseeing things they giving Answers to those that consulted them In which Sense  Socrates  thought famous Men after Death for a Reward of their Vertue were made  Daemons  of a middle Nature mediating betwixt Gods and Men  Ludovicus Vives  says it's a wonder to see how differing the Opinions of the  Gentiles  were  In Aug de Civ Dei l    c    concerning the Gods and  Daemons  So that  Apuleius  thinks otherwise than  Plato Plotinus  than  Apuleius Porphyrius  differs from them both nor does  Proclus  agree in all things with  Jamblicus  or any other As for the  Genii    some think them to be our own Souls some our Inclinations some a certain Light attending us some the  Intellectus Agens c  concerning which I shall set down what I find in several Authors  Apuleius  writes thus  L de Deo Socr  In a certain Sense the Mind of Man even while it is in the Body is call'd a  Daemon    Dii ne hunc ardorem Mentibus addunt  Euri  le An sua cui{que} Deus sit dira Cupido  And therefore a good Desire of Mind is a good God whence some think those are call'd blest  Eudaemons  whose  Daemon  is good that is whose Mind is perfect with Vertue which I think you may properly call a  Genius  because that God which is each Man's Mind tho' it be immortal yet in some sort is engender'd within us And there are some who as it seems to me would have the Mind of Man freed from the Body to be a second sort of  Daemons  This I find in the ancient  Latin  Tongue to be call'd  Lemur  And he of these  Lemures  who taking care of his Posterity keeps the House as a calm and quiet Deity is call'd a Family  Lar  But he that by reason of Demerits in Life is punished by a wandring in the World having no quiet Seat and becomes a vain Terror to good Men and offensive to evil is commonly called  Larva  But when it's uncertain what Lot has happen'd to a Man whether he be a  Lar  or  Larva  he is call'd the God  Manes  the Word God being added for Honour's sake They calling those Gods who among them having justly and prudently govern  d the Course of their Lives  are afterwards Deify'd by Men and admitted to Temples and Sacred Rites as in  Boeotia Amphiaraus  in  Africa Mopsus  in  Egypt Osiris  others elsewhere  Aesculapius  every where And so far concerning those  Daemons  that have had Bodies But there is another kind of more august  Daemons  which being always free from the Fetters and Ties of Bodies are drawn to us by certain Prayers From this sort of sublime  Daemons Plato  thinks each Man has one given him as a Witness and Guard in passing this Life which tho' seen by no Man are always present as Witnesses not only of our Actions but even of our Thoughts and that upon our Return at the End of our Lives the said  Genii  presently carry us as their Charge to Judgment and there stand as Witnesses at our Trial where if we falsifie in any thing they reprove us if we speak Truth they vouch it and Sentence is past according to their Testimony So far  Apuleius    Porphyrius L de Abstinentia  says That as evil  Daemons  hurt Mankind so good  Daemons  never intermit their Offices but foreshew us Dangers as far as they may hanging over our Heads from the evil  Daemons  while they make us Signs both by  Dreams  and by the Soul divinely inspir'd and many other things and that if any Man could distinguish these things which are signify'd he would know and precaution himself against all Frauds for they signifie to all Men but all Persons do not perceive the things that are signified  Occult Phil l    c    Agrippa  says that each Man has a threefold  Genius  to guard him one Sacred another of the  Geniture  the third of the Profession a Man follows The first is not deriv'd from the Stars  or Planets but given by God it being universal and above Nature This directs the Soul still suggesting good Thoughts and enlightens us tho' it be not always observ'd But when we are purify'd and live in a Calm then it's perceiv'd by us then it speaks as it were with us and communicates its Voice being present before in Silence and labours continually to bring us to sacred Perfection By the Assistance of this  Genius  we may shun the Malignity of Fate Whom if we religiously observe by an Uprightness and Holiness of Life as we know  Socrates  did the  Platonicks  think we are wonderfully aided by him both by Dreams and Signs for putting by Evils and securing Good to us The  Genius  or  Daemon  of the  Geniture  descends to us from the Disposition of the World and the Circuits of the Stars that are concern'd in our Generation This is the Sustainer and Guardian of Life it procures it to the Body and takes care of it afterwards and aids the Person for performing that Office for which the Heavens deputed him at his Birth Those therefore who have received a fortunate  Genius  are rendred strong powerful efficacious and prosperous in their Works Wherefore by Philosophers they are call'd  benê Fortunati  and  benè Nati  The  Daemon  of the Profession is given from the Stars to which such a Profession or Sect as a Man professes is subjected and which the Soul when it begins to use Election in this Body and takes upon it Manners secretly wishes which  Daemon  is chang'd for a more worthy or less upon the Change of the Profession When therefore the Profession agrees with our Nature  we get a  Daemon  like us and agreeing with our  Genius  and our Life is made more calm happy and prosperous But when we take on us a Profession unlike or contrary to our  Genius  our Life is rendred more laborious and troublesome by discording Patrons Whence it happens that a Man makes Proficiency in a little time and with a little labour in one Science Art or Ministry who in others Toils with much Sweat and Labour to no purpose And tho' no Science Art or Vertue is to be despised yet that you may live prosperously and act fortunately know first of all your good  Genius  and your Nature and what Good the Disposition of the Heavens and God the Disposer of all these promises you who distributes to each Man as he pleases Follow these Beginnings profess these apply your self to that Vertue to which the prime Distributer raises and conducts you and in what Virtue you find your self to profit most easily endeavour to rise to the height of it that you may excel in one which you cannot do in all However do not slight any Perfection as far as you are able to proceed in it and if you have Guardians according to your Nature and Profession you will find a double Proficiency of your Nature and Profession But if they are unlike follow the best for sometimes you will find the Aid of an egregious Profession better than that of your Nativity  Ib c    The same Author writes thus As to each Man is given a good Spirit so there is an evil one both which seek an Union with our Spirit and endeavour to draw it to them and so mix themselves with it The Good by good Works conformable  to him changes us into Angels by Union as he that adheres to God is made one Spirit with him The Evil  Daemon  by bad Works endeavours to make us conformable and united to him and this is what  Hermes  says when a  Daemon  flows into an Humane Soul he sprinkles in it Seeds of his own Notions whence such a Soul sprinkled with Seeds raised in a Fury brings forth wonderful things and such as are the Performances of  Daemons  For a good  Daemon  when he passes into an holy Soul he raises it to the Light of Wisdom but an evil  Daemon  transfus'd into a wicked Soul incites it to Thefts Murthers and Lusts and whatsoever are the Performances of evil  Daemons  Good  Daemons  as  Jamblicus  says most perfectly purge Souls and others give us other things being present they give Health to the Body Virtue to the Spirit Security to the Mind destroy what brings Death in us foment the Heat and render it more efficacious for Life and by an intelligible Harmony always infuse Light into the Mind I am of the Opinion of those that think all Men are govern'd by the Ministery of many Spirits and are led to all Degrees of Vertues Merits and Dignity if they render themselves worthy of them But those that render themselves unworthy are cast down and detruded by the evil  Daemons  as well as by the good Spirits to the lowest Degree of Misery as their Demerits require But those who are committed to the more sublime  Angels  are preferr'd before other Men For the  Angels  that have Care of them raise them and by a certain secret power subject others to them  which tho' neither perceive yet he that is subjected finds a certain weight of presidency from which he cannot easily disingage himself nay he fears and reverences that force which the superiour  Angels  influence the Inferiours with and bring the Inferiours by a certain Terror into the fear of Presidency So we read that  Mark Antony  formerly being join'd in a singular Friendship with  Octavian Augustus  they were wont often to play together but  Augustus  being always Conqueror a certain  Magician  thus admonish'd  Mark Antony  What do you do  Antony  with that young Man Fly and shun him for tho' you are elder and more experienc'd in Affairs of a more Illustrious Family and have been a great Commander in Wars yet your  Genius  much dreads the  Genius  of this Youth and your Fortune flatters his and unless you fly far from him it will wholly turn to him  Occult Phil Lib    c    Again  Agrippa  tells us the ancient Sages teach us to know the Nature of each Man's  Genius  from the Stars and their Influences and Aspects at each Man's Birth but by so differing and disagreeing Rules that it's very hard to get these Mysteries out of their hands For  Porphyrius  seeks the  Genius  from the Star that is Lady of the  Geniture Maternus  either thence or from the Planets that have been most dignified there or from that whose House the Moon is to enter after that it holds at the time of the Person's Nativity But the  Chaldeans  seek the  Genius  only from the Sun or Moon Others again and many of the  Hebrews  from some cardinal Point of the Heavens or from all of them Others seek for the  good Genius  from the eleventh  House which therefore they call the  good Daemon  and the evil  Genius  from the sixth which they call the  evil Daemon  Since therefore the search of these is laborious and very abstruse we may much more easily seek the nature of our  Genius  from our selves attending to those things which our Mind suggests to us the instinct of Nature dictates and Heaven inclines us to from our first untainted Innocency or when our Mind is purg'd of vain Cares and sinister Effects and Impediments are removed from it These doubtless are the kindly Suggestions of the  Genius  that is given to each Man at his Birth leading and perswading us to that which our Constellation inclines So far  Agrippa  He that would see more concerning the search after each Mans peculiar  Daemon  may read a little Tract on that Subject printed at the end of a Book entitled  Trinum Magicum  set forth by  Longinus    Natalis Comes  says  Myth l    c    The  Genii  or  Daemons  present us with the Species or Images of those things they would perswade us to as in a Glass on which Images when our Soul privately looks those things come into our Mind which if consider'd with Reason give us a right determination of Mind But if a Man setting Reason aside be carried away with the guidance of evil Species or Images he will of necessity incur many Errors especially if the Images are presented us by evil  Daemons  Whence many become wholly given over to Lusts Cruelty Covetousness  c  all which are imputed to the  Genius    Dissert    Maraviglia  in his  Pseudomantia  writes thus Tho' many have thought the  Genii  to be nothing but a certain Light plac'd by God in our Minds at our Birth whereby we understand all things and being understood if they are good we love and pursue them if bad we decline and avoid them yet the more common Opinion was that the  Genii  were not only a light discovering and foreshewing future things to us but certain pure Spirits standing by us always to guard and admonish us Tho' it be far more credible that those  Genii  in all Ages were the very Wills of Men naturally predisposed with a desire and love or an aversion and abhorrence of things Good or Evil discus'd and propos'd to them by the Understanding The same Author tells us  Animadv    that  Pythagoras  thought the  Genii  were certain Lights naturally implanted in our Minds  Apuleius  thought they were the Minds themselves and Disposition of each Man The ancient  Pagans  that they were good and evil  Daemons  appointed to each Man from the beginning for his Governance Again  Dissert    He writes as follows The Prophecying Spirits call'd in the Scriptures  Angels  are call'd by the ancient Pagans  Genii Fatidici  as tho' generated from God and sent from Heaven to us to foretel future things for they thought these fatidical Spirits whom they variously worship'd knew all things that were to come in the World and could foretel them because themselves were a part or a certain Particle of the Soul of the World which is every where For they were of Opinion that this Soul was diffus'd through the whole World but chiefly seated in the  aetherial Region and consequently in the Stars themselves and more especially in the Sun from which all inferior things are fomented as it were by Rays of a vivifying Soul transmitted to them whence also they thought these kinds of Substances compos'd of a subtle Body such as an aerial Body is and that  Angels Daemons  and  Souls  were from a particle of the mundane Soul Which Substances  Apuleius  says are plac'd in the aerial Region of the World that they might procure a more easie Commerse betwixt Gods and Men and more readily unfold the Secrets of the Gods  c  Ludovicus Vives  writes thus  In Aug de Civ Dei L    c    Plato  in his  Timaeus  and  Cratylus  calls the best part of our Mind a  Daemon  His words are these You know what they are whom  Hesiod  calls  Daemons viz  that golden Race of Men of whom he says thus  But after Fate this Race has took away  They're pure terrestrial Daemons call'd and they  Are Mens blest Guard all Evils keep away  Thô I think that Race was call'd Golden not that it consisted of Gold but that it was good and excellent and I conceive we are call'd an IronAge in comparison of that but if any one now living be good  Hesiod  number'd him among his Golden Men And what are the Good but the Prudent and I conceive he call'd them  Daemons  from their Prudence and Skill in Affairs the Name it self in our ancient Tongue shewing it Therefore it's well said of him and most of the rest of the Poets that when a good Man  departs this Life he is plac'd in some excellent Post of Honour and made a  Daemon  for his Wisdom After this manner therefore I affirm that a wise Man so he be good both living and dead is a  Daemon  and justly so call'd This we find in  Plato      whence doubtless  Origen  drew his Error where he writes that human Souls are chang'd into  Daemons  and these again into those  Porphyrius  also says that each Mans peculiar  Daemon  is a certain part of the Soul  viz  the Mind and he is an happy Man and one  Eudaemon  that has got a wise Mind and unhappy on the contrary And that Souls Infested with Vices pass into the nature of evil  Daemons  and are rendred like them in Lies and Impostures  Proclus  explains all these things laying down a threefold nature of a  Daemon  He writes thus  Plato  in his  Timaeus  says our Animal Nature is a  Daemon  but this must be admitted but comparitively for there is a  Daemon  by Essence another by Comparison another by Reference or Respect for every where that which next presides being a certain order of  Daemon  in respect of the Inferior is usually call'd a  Daemon  In which sense  Jupiter  in  Orpheus  calls his Father  Saturn  a  Daemon  And  Plato  in his  Timaeus  call'd those Gods  Daemons  that immediately order Generation Indeed by comparison such an one is a  Daemon  which next provides for every one whether it be God or inferior to God And in some respect that Mind is said a  Daemon  which performs wonderful Actions more like to those of a  Daemon  than of a Man and has his whole Life suspended from a  Daemon  After this way I think  Socrates  call'd those Minds  Daemons  in a Republick which had pass'd their Lives  well and were translated into a better State Finally a  Daemon  by Essence is call'd a  Daemon  not by respect to Sequents nor by reason of some similitude to another thing but has got his Property of himself and has a certain distinct Existence and his proper Powers and his different ways of acting Indeed the rational Soul in  Timaeus  is always call'd an Animal  Daemon  but he does not mean it a  Daemon  simply for when we say a  Daemon  simply its a certain middle Nature betwixt Gods and Men By  Plotinus  and others its quaeried whether our Minds are mov'd of themselves to Desires and Determinations or by the impulse of some Deity And first they said humane Minds were spontaneously mov'd but they found upon search that we were impell'd to all honest Actions by a certain Familiar  Genius  or  Numen  given us at our Birth and that we desire or covet evil things by our Mind For it cannot be that we covet evil things by the Will of a Deity whom its manifest no Evil can please tho' doubtless by many of the  Platonicks  the Affections also with which we are carried away are call'd  Daemons    Ammianus Marcellinus  writes thus  Hist l    Divines tell us that as all Men are born saving the stedfastness of Fate certain Divine Powers are associated to them to be a sort of Governours of their Actions tho' they are seen by few whom manifold Vertues have dignified And this Oracles and famous Authors have taught among whom  Menander  Unicuique homini statim nascenti  Adest Daemon vitae mystagogus  And so we are given to understand from  Homer  's Immortal Poems that the Celestial Gods have not spoke to Valiant Men nor have been present to them nor aided them in their Fights but Familiar  Genii  attended them by whose Aid  Pythagoras  and  Socrates  are said chiefly to have rais'd their Fame  Numa Pompilius  also and the Elder  Scipio  and as some think  Marius  and  Octavianus  who had first the Title of  Augustus  given him and  Hermes Trismegistus  and  Apollonius Tyanaeus  and  Plotinus  who has adventured at some Reasonings about this mystical Matter and profoundly to shew from what beginnings these  Genii  become connected to the Minds of Men which receiving as it were in their Embraces they defend as far as they may and teach them great things if they find them pure and sever'd from the corruption of sinning by an immaculate Society with the Body  L de Vit propr c    Hieronymus Cardanus  says in general there were manifold differences of  Daemons  among the Ancients forbidding as that of  Socrates  admonishing as that of  Cicero  at his Death teaching things to come by Dreams Brutes Casualties advising us to go to a place and deceiving us by one Sense or more and by so much he is the nobler likewise by natural and also by nonnatural things and this we think the noblest also a good and a bad  In not in Lucian de Lucra  Gilbertus Cognatus  writes that some think by the word  Manes  Souls separated from the Body are signified whence we see that ancient Monuments of Sepulchers are inscrib'd  Diis Manibus  and those that demolish Sepulchers are thought to violate the God  Manes  In the Body they are call'd  Genii  separated  from the Body  Lemures  when they infest Houses they are call'd  Larvae  on the contrary if they are good  Familiar Lares    That egregious Philologer  Kircher    Vol    p    in his  Oedipus Aegyptiacus  gives the following account of the  Genii  according to the Doctrine of the  Aegyptians  The  Aegyptians  had always in great veneration certain  Statues  which they call'd  Serapes  the  Latins Penates  or  Lares  Some say the  Penates  are nought but those  Genii  or Deasters by which we Breathe we Know we See we behold the Sun  viz Jupiter Juno Minerva  and  Vesta  for they call'd the middle Region of the Air  Jupiter  the lower  Juno  the top part of the Aether  Minerva  who is the power of divine Intelligence the Earth  Vesta  These they call'd and believ'd to be the Gods of Provinces and of our Births and Presidents over Cities and guards of private Houses And  Dionysius Halicarnassaeus  says the  Romans  call these Gods  Penates  and some translating them into  Greek  call them  Genethlios  or  Genitales  others call them domestick and familiar Gods some the Presidents of Possessions others secret Gods They are call'd  Genethlii  because they are thought to be appointed to the guard of Men presently upon their being Born or because by their vigilancy all things are generated whence the  Genii  are also call'd the Presidents of things that are to be Generated They are call'd  Patrii  because they were thought to preside only over those things which are common to some Region or Province in which with great diligence they order'd things not only belonging to every City but also to every House to all Men Plants and Animals according  to the care committed to them The  Serapes  of the  Egyptians  were nought but Images without any eminency of their Limbs roll'd as it were in SwadlingCloaths partly made of an appropriate Stone partly of Metal Wood or Shell Some of these as tutelary Gods were plac'd in publick Places for a guard of them Others of them were appointed for a guard of Persons and were standing Tutelaries Some others were portable which whither soever Men went they carried with them Some also they carried as  Amulets  about their Necks at their Girdles and about their Handwrists Moreover their Countenances were variously figured for some had a Womanly Countenance and their Heads veil'd some were in the Form of Boys with a  Vitta  about their Heads others were represented other ways They differed also in Instruments some which they call'd  Averrunei  or  Apotropaei  were figur'd with various Instruments as Whips Scourges Nets hanging from their Shoulders and these are the Images which the  Hebrews  call  Theraphim  and which the Scriptures tell us  Rachel  stole from her Father  Laban Gen  which were brought from  Egypt  by the Servants of  Abraham  into  Palestina  and propagated there They call'd them  Theraphim  because as they could not pronounce  S  changing  S  into  T  according to the use of the  Chaldaeans  and changing the last  S  into  im  they call'd those Images  Theraphim  which the  Egyptians  call'd  Serapes  Now the  Penates  of the  Egyptians  were the same with  Osiris Isis Nephte Horus Harpocrates Arveris Apopis  and innumerable Deasters of this kind which tho' they were  accounted the universal  Genii  of all Nature and the same as to Substance only differing in effects yet as they were deputed to the guard of private things they had the Name of  Tutelaries  and were worship'd as private Deities So far  Kircher    From these  Genii  of the  Gentiles Erasmus  in his  Adages  thinks Christian Divines have ascrib'd to each Person two Angels a good and a bad tho' I think he says it with little reason a Communion with Angels being so usual with the Patriarchs from whom in all probability the  Gentiles  took their Doctrine of the  Genii  The  Genii  were drawn under several Forms as of a Serpent a Boy a Girl a Youth or an old Man as  Cebes  in his  Table Censorinus  and many of the Ancients tell us the  Lares  and the  Genii  were the same Now the  Lares  were represented in the Form of YoungMen cloath'd with DogSkins and having a Dog to attend them intimating that they were friendly and fawning to Domesticks and formidable to Strangers as Dogs are wont to be  Pierius  tells us from  Chrysoppus    erogl l    c    that the  Lares  were cloath'd with DogsSkins because they represent the  Genii  who are appointed for our Guard and as Commissioners to inflict Punishments on us for all our evil Words and Deeds and to avenge Crimes and all Impiety as often as Humanity laid by we decline to a brutal Life which the  Genii  as sagacious Dogs pursue and draw to condign Punishments He adds And as the  Genii  are given us for assiduous Attendants never departing from us it's with Justice he says that the Dog as a tutelary Animal was hieroglyphically dedicated to the  Lares  being the same with  the  Genii  which we may more properly call  Angels  And he says he cannot pass by what he has read among ancient Writers  viz  that there was a Temple of  Vulcan  at Mount  Aetna  in  Sicily  in whose Grove there were Dogs which fawn'd on those that came thither with Purity and Piety but miserably rent the Impure and Polluted as tho' divinely presaging the thing  I could write more concerning the  Genii  of the Ancients as of the Sacrifices that were made to them and other particulars but it is beside my business here and I shall only note that beside the  Genii  attending each Person the Ancients suppos'd others presiding over each Country City  c  Those in the Figure prefixt to this Book being such as I took them from  Cartarius  his Images of the Gods of the Ancients The Explanation of which Figures is as follows  The Figure on the lefthand represents the evil  Genius  that Infested the Inhabitants of the Town  Temessa  in  Italy  The Story is thus  Pausanias  writing of  Euthymus    In Clia  Poster  the Champion tells us that  Ulysses  in his Wandrings coming to the Town of  Temessa  one of his Associates for having ravish'd a Virgin was ston'd to death by the Townsmen whereupon his Ghost continually infested them so that they were upon quitting the Town till they were told by  Apollo  's Oracle that to appease him they must build him a Temple and sacrifice to him yearly the most beautiful Virgin they had among them which as they prepar'd to perform it chanc'd that one  Euthymus  a Champion came to the Town and desir'd to be admit  the Temple who seeing the Virgin  and falling in Love with her undertook to fight with the  Genius  and overcame him and forc'd him out of the Country and married the Virgin This  Genius  was of a very black Colour and a formidable Appearance having a Wolf's Skin fasten'd about him  As to the little Figure in the middle the Story is thus as  Pausanias  relates it in the same Book The  Eleans  Worship as their Country God  Sosipolis  which signifies the Preserver of their City His Sacrifices being wont to be yearly Celebrated in the Temple of  Lucina  Concerning this God what follows is recorded When the  Arcadians  invaded the Country of the  Eleans  and the  Eleans  presented an Army against them a Woman with a Child sucking at her Breast came to the chief Commanders of the  Eleans  and told them that when she brought forth that Child she was admonish'd in a Dream to place him with the  Eleans  in the Battle whereupon the chief Commanders of the  Eleans  having thought fit to credit the Woman plac'd the Child before their Standard Upon the  Arcadians  Onset the Boy in their sight turn'd into a Serpent by which Prodigy being frighted they presently fled the  Eleans  smartly pursuing them And upon getting this famous Victory they gave him the Name of  Sosipolis  and at a place where the Serpent was seen to go into a Cavern a Temple was built after the Victory and Honours were decreed to  Lucina  because they thought the Boy was brought into the World by her This God was drawn as a Boy with a Garment of various Colours sprinkled with Stars holding in his Hand an Horn of Plenty for in  this Form he was seen by some Person in a Dream I may here note that the Form of Serpents under which the  Genii  were worship'd denotes the wise and vigilant Care they have over us  As for the Figure on the Righthand In some of  Adrian  's Coin this Inscription is found  Gen P R  where is seen the Image of a Military Man compass'd about with a Garment which reaches to the middle of his Legs having in the Righthand a Dish like a Sacrificing Vessel and in the Left an Horn of Plenty This probably being the  Genius  of the People of  Rome  under whose Guardianship their City was the Horn and Dish shewing that the  Roman  State as all others are supported by outward Plenty and Religious Devotion towards God  In some of the Ancient Coins of  Trajan  and  Adrian  is seen a  Genius  presenting with his Righthand a Dish on an Altar adorn'd with Garlands and holding in his Lefthand a Whip or somewhat like it hanging down This by some is thought to denote Rewards and Punishments In the Coin of  Marcus Aurelius  is a  Genius  having such a Dish in the Righthand and an Horn of Plenty in the other with this Inscription  Geniis Exerci Et Genio Augusti  So in the Coin of  Fl Valerius Constantinus Genio Populi Romani P L C  where he holds in the Righthand a Dish with a Star in the Left an Horn of Plenty Again in that of  Maximinus  sometimes with this Inscription  Genio Augusti sis  sometimes  Genio Populi Romani T F  sometimes  Genio Imperatoris  These and the like Inscriptions are gather'd together in a particular Book by the Learned  Physician  Adolphus Occo  In the Antiquities also of  Appian  such Inscriptions of Monuments are found in the City of  Tarraco  in  Arragonia And so much for a general Notion of the  Genii  of the Ancients    CHAP II Concerning the  Genii  that are ascribed to  Socrates Aristotle Ptolinus  Porphyrius Jamblicus Chicus  Scaliger  and  Cardan    THO' the  Genii  of these Men are reducible to the Chapters I shall go upon beneath where I shall examine what perception Men have had of Spirits or  Genii  by their several Senses yet in regard the Learned  Naudaeus  in his  Apology for all the great Men that have been accused of Magick    Part    c    has Writ particularly concerning the  Genii  of these Men and exploded them and other Authors have writ against the  Genius  of  Socrates  I shall here particularly consider what may be said concerning these  Genii    The most celebrated Instance of a  Genius  among the Ancients is that of  Socrates  Testimonies for it are given by  Plato Xenophon  and  Antisthenes  his Contemporaries confirm'd by  Laertius Plutarch Maximus Tyrius Dion Chrysostomus Cicero Apuleius Ficinus  and others many of the Moderns besides  Tertullian Origen Clemens Alexandrinus Austin  and  others  Socrates  himself in  Plato  's  Theage  says by some Divine Lot I have a certain  Daemon  which has followed me from my Childhood as an Oracle and this is a Voice which when it happens always disswades the thing I am about to do but never prompts me to do any thing and if any of my Friends communicate any thing with me and the Voice is heard it disswades and is against the doing of it And presently after he relates how a person lost his Life for having despised the command of his  Daemon  warning him not to depart from him Again speaking to  Alcibiodes  he says my Tutor is Better and Wiser than you And speaking concerning the power of his  Daemon  e'en on other persons that used his Company and Conversation he says if it be grateful to my God you will profit much and in a little time if on the contrary not And again in his Apology he says going out of doors this Morning the sign of God did not oppose me  Many have been of opinion that  Socrates  had not only a perception of his  Genius  by his sense of Hearing but likewise by his Sight and Feeling So  Apuleius  says he judg'd  Socrates  perceived the sign of his  Daemon  not only by his Ears  Lib de Deo Socr  but by his Eyes also because he affirmed that often not a Voice but a divine Sign was presented to him which he was the more induced to believe for that it was so common a thing with the  Pythagoreans  to see  Daemons  that they wondred if any Man said he had seen none Which Gift I impute to their great silence and their deep recess of Mind for as  Paracelsus  with others say  Silence is the joy of all  Spirits  The Author of the small Tract entitled  De proprii cujusque nati Daemonis Investigatione  Printed at the end of the  Trinum Magicum  before mentioned says the same  viz  that  Socrates  both heard his  Daemon  and saw him And  Pictorius  in his Dialogue  de Materia Daemonum  says that  Socrates  affirms his  Daemon  often to have spoke to him who he sometimes saw and touch'd So again  l de Daemo Socret  Theocritus  in  Plutarch  will have it that a Vision attended him from his Childhood guiding him in all the actions of his Life which Vision going before him was a light in Affairs where humane prudence could not reach and that the Spirit often spoke to him divinely governing and inspiring his Intentions  Notwithstanding the opinion of these Men and others that  Socrates  had a perception of his  Genius  by more senses than one I shall only here insist on the perception he had of him by his sense of Hearing which in regard it's so well attested by  Plato  and  Xenophon  his Disciples who were envious Competitors for Learning if it may be so said of  Philosophers  so that they can no ways be suspected for having combined together to impose on the World I wholly give credit to tho' I well know there always have been and still are some Men in the World who have caveled at what is said of  Socrates  's  Genius  as a thing feigned whose reasons I shall now examine  The learned  Naudaeus  in his laudable Work abovementioned and the  th  Chapter of it treating concerning the  Genii  ascrib'd to  Socrates  and others as above writes thus According to the Authority of all Authors each of these Persons may boast of having been led into the  Temple of Glory and Immortality by the assistance of some  Genius  or  Familar Daemon  which was to them  de Deo Socr  as  Apuleius  says a singular Guide a domestick Inspector an inseparable Judge and Witness a disapprover of Evils and an approver of Good but since we cannot maintain this Opinion without abating much of these Mens Merit and the Obligation we owe to their labours by the means of which and not of those  Daemons  and tutelary Gods so many precious Relicks and Monuments of their Learning are come to our Knowledge I think it very proper to preserve the praise due to them and to shew by the true Construction that ought to be given to this Conversation how far those are out of the way in their Imaginations who perswade themselves it was such as that of  Angels  with Holy Persons or of  Daemons  with Magicians for to come as near to the Truth as we may we ought to observe that the  Platonicks  according to the Testimonies of  Jamblicus  and  F  xius    L de myst Ae  ypt Jac  ment in Phaedon  suppos'd four sorts of rational Animals under that they call'd the first Being or the first Good who is the Prime Author and Mover of all things  viz  the Celestial Gods or Angels  Daemons  that were Inferiors to them  Heroes  and the Souls of Men in general and that the chief Office and Duty of  Daemons  being no other as  Proclus  says but to concern themselves in the Affairs and Conduct of the last  L de Anim Daem  and to serve them as Guides and Mediators towards the Gods Men have taken an occasion from the resemblance of these Actions to those that Souls exercise on their Bodies to give these sometimes the Name of  Daemons  and especially when they come so to free themselves from  the Slavery and Tyranny of the matter where they are as it were interr'd that they make themselves absolute Mistresses of all their Faculties and no longer produce but Miracles and Actions altogether like those of  Daemons  which is the true Sense according to which  Apuleius  said that the Mind of Man  L de Deo Socr  even while in the Body is call'd a  Daemon  and  Heraclitus  that the Spirit of Man serv'd him for a  Genius  and the just desire and good Operation of the Soul may be likewise qualified with the name of God since ev'n  Porphyrius  said to this purpose after  Plato  in his  Timaedus  that God has given us the Superior faculty of our Spirit as a  Daemon  to guide us and that he may rightly be call'd an  Eudaemon  that takes Wisdom as a watch Tower to guide him in all the Actions of his Life which might serve us for a General solution to Answer all that is said of the Familiarity and Conversation of certain  Daemons  with  Socrates Aristotle  and others if it were not rather requisite to satisfie particular Objections that may be made against each of them and to examine first what we ought to believe concerning the so famous and renown'd  Daemon  of  Socrates  no less celebrated by the Authority of those that have giv'n us the History of it than by the great Diversities of Judgments that have been made of him some saying that there may be some likelihood of Truth for its being really so others that it was a meer Fiction of this Philosopher or of his two Disciples  Xenophon  and  Plato  who as falsly publish'd the report of this Divine Assistance as that of the Oracles declaring him the wisest of Men And here  Naudaeus  lays before  us all the Dirt that envy or prejudice has thrown on  Socrates  and then goes on thus But since I should but expose my self to the laughter of all Men to follow the licentiousness of these dangerous Spirits who so freely sham the Authority of these two great Philosophers as also that of  Apuleius Maximus Tyrius Cicero Plutarch  and almost all the good Authors to shew themselves more subtle and clear sighted than others by crushing to pieces this old Image I rather chuse to range my self of their side that respect it since I cannot perswade my self that so great a number of Writers would have loaded  Socrates  with so many Praises or call'd him as  Martial  did the great Oldman  L    Epigr    Sat    L de Deo Socra  Persius  the reverend Master  Valerius Maximus  the Mind vested with virile Strength or finally as  Apuleius  the Oldman of Divine Wisdom if he had not signalized himself by his Wisdom so that we ought rather to excuse than reprehend those who do not judge without reason that he had acquir'd it thro' the favour and Assistance of some  Daemon  Tho' nevertheless there be no less uncertainty concerning the Explication of his Nature than of malice and calumny in the precedent Opinion for  Apuleius  would have it to be a God  Lactantius  and  Tertullian  a Devil  Plato  thought he was invisible  Apuleius  that he might also be visible  Plutarch  that it was a sneezing on the right or left side according to which  Socrates  foretold a good or evil Event of the thing undertaken  Maximus Tyrius  that it was a remorse of Conscience against the promptness and violence of his Natural Temper which was neither heard nor seen by which  Socrates  was withheld and hindred from doing  some evil thing  Pomponatius  that it was the Stars that rul'd at his Nativity and finally  Montaigne  was of Opinion it was a certain impulse of his Will that presented it self to him without Council of his Discourse As for my self I believe it may be said conformably enough to truth that this  familiar Daemon  of  Socrates  which was to him a foreseer in uncertain things a preadmonisher in doubtful a guide in dangerous was nought but the good rule of his Life the wise Conduct of his Actions and the result of all his Virtues that form'd in him this Prudence which may with Justice be call'd the lustre and seasoning of all his Actions the Eye that sees all guides and orders all and in a Word the Art of Life as Physick is the Art of Health So that there is much more seeming ground to believe that the Soul of this Philosopher purifyed from its violent Passions and enrich'd with all kinds of Vertues was the true  Daemon  of his Conduct than to imagine that he entangled himself with Illusions and  Phantomes  gave credit to them or follow'd their Counsels being a thing wholly absurd which  Plutarch  seems to have a mind to root out of our Fancies when he says in the Book he has compos'd concerning this  Daemon  that  Socrates  did not despise Celestial things as the  Athenians  would perswade him at his Condemnation though it be very true that many Apparitions Fables and Superstitious things being crept into the Philosophy of  Pythagoras  and his Disciples which rendered it wholly ridiculous and contemptible he did what he could to manage it with prudence and to clear it of all these Tales and to believe of it but what he judged reasonable  and beneath having solv'd some difficulties to be met with concerning the  Daemon  of  Socratus  he adds but beside that this would be a too manifest interfering with the Precept of  Horace    De Art Poet  Nec Deus Intersit nisi dignus vindice nodus  Inciderit  to refer the Predictions of  Socrates  and the Counsel he gave his Friends to some Divinity we may more reasonably say that as he was wholly carried to moral Actions so he had particularly considered all the accidents that happen'd to Men and that the least thing made him foresee and judge of the future This is what  Naudaeus  has writ concerning the  Daemon  of  Socrates    Pseudom vet Disser    Maraviglia  writes that  Socrates  being wholy taken up in giving Moral Precepts ascribed all to a  Genius  thinking thereby to give weight to his profitable Arguments which he every where used for Instruction well knowing what authority a Man carries who is believed to give his Instructions by the direction of a Divine  Afflatus  Hence though  Plutarch  and  Apuleius  believed  Socrates  's  Genius  was a true  Daemon  which by reason of his most pure and calm mind convers'd with him from his Infancy yet nothing evinces it to be ought but the natural Subtilty Sagacity Reason and Prudence of his Mind cultivated by Meditation and Practice which as a right  dictamen  admonisht and proposed to him things to be rightly done and judged well of Futurities for its reason which continually whispers unto us what is to be hop'd for or  feared and that is wont to be called our  Genius  and Inward Voice always speaking to us without having need of a separate  Genius  And  Timarcus  in  Plutacch  who went into  Trophonius  's Cave to enquire after the truth of  Socrates  's  Genius  could receive nothing more probable but those  Genii  were portions of the Mind seated about the head of Man as being naturally endow'd with a greater Wisdom  The Learned  Anton Van Dale  Dissert    c    M D  in his last Edition of his Book of  Oracles  rejects the  Daemon  of  Socrates  thus What have not the Ancient  Pagans  said concerning the  Daemon  of  Socrates  what not even the  Christians  but from what Men of Authority does it appear that  Socrates  ever had such a  Familiar Daemon  since all of them ought to have had it from the mouth of  Socrates  or of the  Socraticks Cherephon  and others to whom  Socrates  had told it And after having exploded what the Oracle is said to have deliver'd of  Socrates viz  that he was the Wisest of Men he concludes the Chapter thus But truly those things which were so rashly believed and delivered by so many both  Christians  and  Pagans  concerning his  Daemon  which is testified only by himself for so he boasts of himself in  Plato  's  Dialogue  Entitled  Theage  and others of his Disciples forsooth carry the same or rather the like shew of Truth for who may not as well believe  Pythagoras  who as  Laertius  testifies from others said he was first  Aethalides  then  Euphorbus  then  Hermotimus  then  Pyrrhus  a Fisherman of  Delos  before he was in the last place  Pythagoras  for the Reasons and Arguments of  Socrates  concerning his  Daemon  in  Plato  carry the same weight  Hist des Spectres l    c    Monsieur Le Loyer  delivers himself in a different way concerning the  Daemon  of  Socrates  writing thus Do we not find that the Idolatrous  Egyptians  believed there were  Genii  who admonished Men committed to their Care and Government by a well form'd and articulate Voice and from whom had they this but from the  Hebrews  Those that examine the Doctrine of the  Egyptians  and their Priests know that they are but the  Hebrews  Apes tho' concealing as much as possible their Authors and those whose Doctrine they follow which they do with such an affected dissimulation that he that does not look near to them shall never be able to discover the traces and footsteps of these Thieves They had learnt that the  Hebrews  by a secret Tradition held their  Patriarchs  had  Angels  which guarded them and that the Patriarch  Jacob  had not concealed his having an  Angel  which had preserved him in all places where he had been they held also that these  Angels  Invisibly admonisht the said Patriarchs and that their Voice was heard  From this Hebrew Tradition and Doctrine the  Egyptians  forged their  Genii  confounding them with the  Angels  tho' the  Genii  are but  Daemons  and gave them a Voice by which they advertized Men and I certainly believe that from the  Egyptians Plato  drew and took the  Genius  or  Daemon  of  Sacrates  which he makes Invisible and to be heard Speaking and forming some Voice And tho  Plato  imitating in this the  Egyptians  seems to say that the  Genius  which governed and guided  Socrates  was a good  Daemon  and  Genius  yet I take him but for a Devil which led  Socrates  to an unhappy Death The same  Le Loyer  in his said Book  Cap    says he concludes with several Doctors of the Church that  Socrates  was a Magician because he used Divination  Now to consider what these Authors have said concerning the  Genius  of  Socrates  we find that even those that deal the most mildly with him as  Naudaeus  and  Maraviglia  deny any Voice coming to him from without which the words in  Plato  plainly and naturally import he had And I believe it must be granted me that the main ground these Men and others of the same Opinion go upon is that not having had any experience of any such thing in themselves and not being fully convinc'd that any other Person has notwithstanding the Testimonies of Men in all Ages and the Instances I shall give they are uneasie to yield the Point even in the Case of  Socrates  And I must here say I have hundreds of times seen heard and convers'd with those they call  Genii Angels  Spirits or  Daemons  appearing to me in humane Shapes of which I shall give some Relation beneath beside the Experiences of many other Persons known to me and now living in the same kind whom opposers notwithstanding any reluctancy must give me leave to believe to be Men of as sound Sense as themselves  When such Persons of an over cautious belief meet with any thing in History or hear something related in this kind we find they proceed two ways either being somewhat tender of the Authority such things are deliver'd by they excogitate various Explications of the Fact as each Man's Fancy suggests to him so that they will allow somewhat  of Truth in it after the way they explain it as we find in the Case of  Socrates Naudaeus  and  Maraviglia  have done which is like the Complement young Philosophers have been taught to pay to  Aristotle  in distinguishing his Text when it has seem'd to make against them or they flatly deny it and explode it as a Fable with Dr  Van Dale Gallaeus  and many others as any Man may easily do of any Historical Fact however attested since it will not bear a demonstrative proof and boldly cry out  Affirmanti Incumbit probatio    It was a laudable Undertaking of  Naudaeus  to write an Apology for all the Great Men accused of Magick by some narrow Understandings and which I think he has generally well perform'd But as to his way of Apologizing for the Men abovementioned I cannot see how it should abate of their Merit or of the Obligation we have to them for the Works they have left us as he seems to think it would tho' they had receiv'd a good part of their Knowledge from the Suggestion of Intellectual Beings for the World has been long under a Mistake if prophetick Learning which beside what has been immediately inspir'd from the prime Cause Men may have sometimes had by a suggestion from Intelligences be not of as great a Merit and has not laid as great Obligations on Mankind as any excogitated by Humane Wit and we are as well owing to the prime Cause for what we deliver by our ordinary Faculties as for what in this extraordinary way  Again Tho' the primary end of good  Angels  in directing Mankind be in things relating  to their eternal Salvation yet I know not why they may not sometimes inspire or openly direct them in humane Studies and in things relating to humane Life so they are of a good tend  ncy as I find not but the knowledge of  Socrates  and that of others whom I shall mention beneath were tho' that some have had Knowledge inspir'd them by Evil Spirits its what Divines generally teach Neither shall I here take upon me to maintain that the  Genii  which attended some of the Persons above mentioned by  Naudaeus  if they had any were of the better sort  There is one thing I shall note in  Naudaeus  's account of the  Daemon  of  Socrates viz  Where he tells us  Plutarch  said it was a Sneezing on the right or left side according to which  Socrates  foretold a good or evil event to the thing undertaken Now tho'  Plutarch  in his Academical way of Writing in his Tract of  Socrates  's  Daemon  introduces one  Polymnis  who set forth this Opinion  viz  that  Socrates  was guided in his judgment by a Sneezing happening to himself or some stander by yet I see no colour of reason why this opinion should be fathered upon  Plutarch  himself more than others there set forth Mr  Bogan  tho' otherwise a learned Man in his additions to Mr  Rouss  's  Archeologiae Atticae  seems to me a little overcomical in sporting with  Socrates  and his  Genius  saying  L    Sect    c    Socrates  as  Emuncte naris  as he was had so little Sense himself as to fetch advice himself from another mans Nose and to make a Sneeze serve instead of a  Genius  or  Daemonium  to tell him the Good and the Bad  c  but all men are not admirers of Pedantick Railery  To come to  Maraviglia  we find he will have it according to his prejudice that  Socrates  's  Genius  was only his pretence to gain authority to the Doctrine he delivered tho' still he allows somewhat extraordinary in him that may be call'd his  Genius viz  the wonderful Sagacity of his Mind cultivated by a long Meditation which might in a particular manner have directed his Judgment as to present and future things But I think this suspition of  Socrates  's design in his  Gaenius  is poorly grounded since it no way appears that ever  Socrates  imputed the Doctrine he delivered to the Suggestion of his  Genius  as  Numa  and others did but only his being withheld by him from doing some Actions which would have prov'd prejudicial to him  As for Dr  Van Dale  he allows  Socrates  no more than other Men and wholly rejects his  Genius  as not being well attested and charges Christians and Pagans for having over rashly believ'd and deliver'd as a truth the Story concerning him  Now as to this with reverence to the Learning of so great a Man I must take freedom to say it seems to me he has overdone the matter in this case by pressing things too far as I conceive he has in several other parts of his Works for as to his rejecting the testimonies of  Xenophon  and  Plato  as not worth minding I believe by unprejudiced Readers they may be look'd upon as unexceptionable Testimonies in that matter as any two Men now living on the face of the Earth for what they shall deliver by hearsay if we shall be led by suspicions and remote possibilities of Fraud and contrivance of such Men  all historical truth shall be eluded when it consists not with a Mans private humour or prejudice to admit it As for what he further urges that if we believe  Socrates  's boast as he calls it of his  Daemon  we may as well believe  Pythagoras  who said he was first  Aethalides  then  Euphorbus c  before he came to be  Pythagoras  I think there is a great disparity in the case for as to Divine Voices being heard its no more than what all the Ancient Prophets testified besides what we find recorded of them in all Christian and Pagan Histories nor are living Testimonies wanting whereas for the other its well known how all the learned have expounded the  Pythagorean  Transmygration concerning which the very learned  Joan Reuchlin  writes thus  De Art Cab l    The  Pythagorean Metempsycosis  signify'd nothing among the truly learned but a similitude of notions and studies which were formerly in some Men and afterwards sprung up again in others and so it was formerly said that  Euphorbus  was reborn in  Pythagoras  because that warlike Valour which was celebrated in the  Trojan Euphorbus  some way appear'd again in  Pythagoras  by reason of the love he bore to the  Athletae  or those that gave themselves to manlike exercises  F  cinus  also testifies the same affirming  In Ep  that the Transmigration also as it respects Brutes and Men according to the sense of all the learned  Platonicks  except  Pl  tinus  imported only that as affects of Brutes became habituated in Men Man seem'd to have past into their Natures But if Dr  Van Dale  will have it that  Pythagoras  declared this as a truth in a litteral sense when he shall produce some  others who have declared the like experience of a Transmigration in themselves as I have given instances backing what is said of  Socrates  we may allow it a like motive of credibility And if the opinion of  Origen  whom the Dr praises as more discreet in his opinion concerning the Pagan  Oracles    L de Orac Dissert    c    than the other primitive Fathers weighs any thing with him he will find him pretty smart against those that reject the  Genius  of  Socrates  where he says Nor will there ever be wanting calumny to the uncandid  Contra Els l    who have a malicious sense even of the best of Men since they make a sport even of the  Genius  of  Socrates  as a thing feign'd  Since I have intimated it above I shall here give a farther instance or two of this learned Persons overarguing himself as I conceive in the Third Chapter of his First  Dissertation  treating of the Origen of  Oracles  where he writes against the Imposture of the  Gentiles  in that kind he charges them for having contrived generally the seats of their Oracles on Mountains where were Caves and Subterraneous Vaults partly made by Nature partly by Art for carrying on their Cheats and that none but Kings Princes and Great Men conscious of the Cheat were admitted to consult them Now if any of the  Gentiles  who had a belief in their  Oracles  as I think it beyond dispute that many even of the most learned of them had nay if they knew them to be Cheats as some thought them to be would they not presently reply that a Mountain was made choice of for  Moses  to receive the Law of God and that no Man under pain of Death was to approach the Mountain but himself and  Aaron  and likewise  that the  Jews  kept their  Sanctum Sanctorum  altogether as private and as liable to a suspicion of a Cheat and admitted none but the Prince the Senate or some great Person to consult the  Oracle  of  Urim and Thummim  and the HighPriest only saw the sign of God in the Brestplate directing an Answer as the learned  Joan Leusden  has set forth in his  Philologus Hebro mixtus    Disser  ·  So that we find the force of this Argument wholly evacuated it pressing equally on both sides And I am sorry I must say it I find too many Arguments made use of by some Writers against the Religion of the  Gentiles  which fall indirectly I will not say designedly on all Religion  Again the said Author  Ch    in his Tract  De Divinatione Idololatricâ  after having told us of the Superstitious Practice of the  Gentiles  in driving away the  Lemures  with a noise of Brass adds Those that will believe these things may as well believe what  Pliny  writes  viz  Above all things that have ever been heard of  L    c    is the prodigy happening in our Time by a ruine in the  Marrucine Territories  where the Olivefield of  Vectius Marcellus  a chief Person of the Equestral Order past over the whole common Road and on the contrary Plow'd Lands came thence into the Olivefield Now this seem'd very strange to  Pliny  who tho' an admirer of great things and a Man excellently qualified for recording historical Facts was never lookt upon by the learned as a diligent enquirer into causes and wholly incredible to the Author tho' I think it no such extraordinary  Phaenomenon  of Nature there being several Instances to be given of the like kind as well within our Nation as elsewhere  Stow  tell us in his  Summary  that  An    Jan  the  th  at  Hermitage  in  Dorcetshire  a piece of Ground of three Acres remov'd from its place and was carryed over another Close where Alders and Willows grew the space of forty Rods or Perches and stopt up the Highway that leads to  Cirne  a MarketTown and yet the Hedges it was inclos'd with inclose it still and the Trees stand bolt upright and the place where the Ground was before is left a Pit So  An    Marcleyhill  in the East part of  Herefordshire  with a roaring noise removed it self from the place where it stood and for three days together travell'd from its old Seat It began first to remove  Febr  the  th  being  Saturday  at Six of the clock in the Evening and by Seven of the clock the next Morning it had gone forty Paces carrying with it Sheep in their Folds Hedgerows and Trees whereof some were overturn'd and some that stood upon the Plain are firmly growing upon the Hill those that were East were turn'd West and those in the West were set in the East In this remove it overthrew  KinnastonChappel  and turn'd two Highways near an hundred Yards from their old Course The Ground that thus removed was about Acres which opening it self with Rocks and all bore the Earth before it Yards space without any stay leaving Pasturage in the place of the Tillage and the Tillage overspread with Pasturage at last overwhelming its lower parts it mounted to an Hill of twelve Fathoms high and so rested after three Days travel More instances may be giv'n of the same Nature this being wrought by that kind of Earthquakes we call  Brastae  or  Brasmati  s    from  ferveo bullio vi aestus eficio  which raise and protrude the Earth many Islands having been so cast up from the bottom of the Sea on a sudden As for the Plough'd Lands coming in the place of the Olivefield we may easily conceive this to have happen'd by a Gyrative motion of that piece of Land following upon the protrusion from the deep  I intimate these things only to caution Men not to be over hasty in rejecting things that may seem Strange and do not presently fall within their Comprehension and that in opposing Adversaries they use due Circumspection in attending to the vast extent of the Power of Nature and the various Manifestations of God in Men many things being evident to some Persons which to others seem wholly incredible  In the last place as for the Suggestions of  Monsieur le Loyer  viz that  Plato  had his Notion of  Socrates  's  Genius  from the  Egyptians  c I think them altogether groundless since  Pythagoras  who liv'd before  Socrates  is averr'd to have made his great Proficiency in Learning from his Converse with Spirits and since it was so usual a thing for the  Pythagoreans  to see Spirits as  Apuleius  acquaints us And why must it be an evil  Genius  bringing  Socrates  to an unhappy end If we believe  Plato  we find  Socrates  did not think it so but on the contrary was desirous to die and I think no considering Man who has liv'd an upright Life would think it an unhappy thing to be freed from the grievances of decrepit Age  Socrates  according to the lowest Computation being Yeas of Age when he died  Suidas  says others And as for his being  a  Magician  this need not to have been feign'd to procure him a  Genius  since his  Daemon  is said to have attended him from his Infancy And so much concerning the  Genius  of  Socrates    I shall now proceed to give an Account from  Naudaeus  of the  Genii  ascrib'd to the other Men beforementioned by him As for the  Genius  of  Aristotle  he thinks it a Jest in those Men that have ascrib'd one to him it being manifest according to all his Interpreters that he never admitted other  Intelligences  but those he assign'd as movers to each Sphere of the Heavens rejecting all other kinds of  Daemons  so standing firm to his Principles and not admitting any thing that was not known to him either by Motion or Operation He likewise referring all that is wont to be ascrib'd to  Daemons  to Nature that is to the Properties of Natural things to Humours and Temperaments of Animals to the Nature of Places and to their Vapours and Exhalations leaving nothing to do for these Substances And after  Naudaeus  has giv'n several Reasons against  Aristotle  's admitting of  Daemons  he adds I think one probable Argument may be drawn from his Book concerning Divination by Dreams where to shew that there is nothing Supernatural in them he says but because some Animals likewise Dream certainly Dreams are not sent from God nor caus'd by him but must be  Daemonical  since Nature is  Daemonical  not  Divine  And though it be greatly controverted among Interpreters and Commentators  In comment in hurclos In c    Alvin Digress    in what Sense we must explain this  Epithet  giv'n by  Aristotle  to Nature it seems  Leonicus  has better hit on it than the others and that the Learned  Charpentarius    has found the whole Energy of this Phrase when he says  Aristotle  would shew by it that that force may be found in Nature well order'd depending on the Conversion of the Celestial Orbs which may serve to explain all those things for which others have recourse to  Daemons  by the means of which Explication he says he may answer the sole Reason giv'n by  Caesalpinus    L de Invest Daem perip c    for establishing  Daemons  according to the Doctrine of  Aristotle    In reference therefore to the  Genius  of  Aristotle  ascrib'd to him by some Persons I shall set down what  Piccolomini  and  Caesalpinus  have writ concerning his Opinion as to the Existence of  Daemons  the former contending against his Admission of them the latter for it and shall subjoyn my own Sense in the Matter  Piccolomini  states the case  L de invest Daem paerip  whether  Aristotle  thought there were  Daemons  and concludes in the Negative writing as follows The word  Daemon  may be taken either metaphorically or properly if metaphorically  Aristotle  may be allow'd to have granted  Daemons  he saying    Top loc    that  Xenocrates  affirms him to be an  Eudaemon  who has a studious Mind for this is to each Man an  Eudaemon  so we may also say with  Aristotle  that the Mind coming from without and governing a Man is his  Eudaemon  so in his Book of  Divination by Dreams  he says That Dreams are not sent by God but are  Daemonical  because Nature is  Daemonical  not  Divine  intimating that Nature by a Metaphor may be call'd a  Daemon  which name agrees to it because it is God's Messenger is powerful and Works secretly and wonderfully all which things are ascrib'd to  Daemons  so when the name of  Daemon  is given to a part of  the Mind leading us we may say with  Aristotle  that two  Daemons  are born and live with us  viz  Reason and the sensual Appetite and he that is led by right Reason is led by a good  Daemon  and he that is led by Anger or Concupiscence is carryed away by an evil  Daemon  but the doubt is concerning a  Daemon  properly taken whether it be a  Daemon  by its Nature or a foregin  Daemon  the former of which may be aptly enough defin'd to be  An Animal having a reason and understanding superior to Man using a subtle body and mediating betwixt God and Man  the latter is the Soul of a Man departed this Life being freed from the gross Body and using a subtle vehicle And in this Sense  Aristotle  did not think there were  Daemons  not  Daemons  by Nature First because as he profest to explain all particular degrees of things to set forth a compleat Philosophy he no where speaks of  Daemons  Secondly in his third Book of the  Soul  he plainly rejects them  Test    setting forth that no Animal can consist either of Air or Fire or any other simple Body though he makes particular mention of Air and Fire because the  Academicks  thought the Bodies of  Daemons  to be aiery and in some sort fiery But to pass by many other Passages of  Aristotle  against  Daemons  he thinks this a most firm Reason That there is nothing in the Universe in vain speaking of the Degrees and Species of things whereas if there were  Daemons  they would be of no use according to  Aristotle  which hence appears because all those things which are commonly judg'd Works of  Daemons  are ascrib'd by him to other Causes never any to  Daemons  For those things which excited the ancient Philosophers  to excogitate  Daemons  were chiefly Divinations by Dreams which  Aristotle  ascrib'd to Nature the various kinds of Furies or Raptures which he attributes to a various temperament of Melancholy the Answers of  Oracles  which he refers to the property of certain Steams proceeding from the Cavities of the Earth the saying of a Verse by an ignorant Person which  Aristotle  likewise refers to Melancholy Since therefore Philosophers are rais'd by Works to the search of Causes and  Aristotle  ascrib'd all those Works to other Causes and not to  Daemons  we gather he thought there were none And so as to  Foreign Daemons  or the Souls of Men separated from the Body  Aristotle  held there were none For in his Second Book of the  Soul  he says  Text    there is no Soul without the Body And in the Seventh of his  Metaphysicks  he says there is no Man without Flesh and Bones And in his Second Book of the  Generation of Animals  he says  Cap    there is no Instrument without a Faculty nor an organical Faculty without an Instrument Now the Soul of Man is organical  c  Caesalpinus  after having quoted  Plato    L de Invest Daem Perip cap    introducing  Socrates  concluding against his Calumniators who charg'd him of admitting no Gods that he that grants there are  Daemonical  Works of necessity admits  Daemons  which are either Gods or Sons of Gods in his Seventh Chapter he writes thus We may gather in  Aristotle  that there are  Daemons  by that Argument by which  Socrates  gather'd there were He that asserts there are  Daemonical Works  is compel'd of necessity to confess there are  Daemons Aristotle  asserts there are  Daemonical Works viz  Dreams and Nature  therefore of Necessity he must confess there are  Daemons  whence they are so denominated And the Philosopher seems to have understood that middle Nature betwixt God and Mortal things mention'd before by us to be a  Daemon  for when he had deny'd Dreams to be sent by God as some thought they were because they happen not only to the wisest of Men but indifferently to Idiots and some other Animals yet he says Dreams are  Daemonical  because Nature is  Daemonical  not  Divine  tho' therefore somewhat Divine be contain'd in Nature yet it does not merit the Name of Divine but  Daemonical  because it follows the Wisdom of an Intelligence whence it's rendred admirable even in the least things and Dreams are  Daemonical  by reason of the wonderful force of the Imagination  Now these two Authors consider'd I think it may be agreed that  Aristotle  did not admit a  Daemon  properly taken as  Piccolomini  has set forth but he admitted the Facts commonly ascrib'd to  Daemons  which he accounted for from other Causes as we find by what is quoted from  Charpentarius  by  Naudaeus  according to which as  Naudaeus  says  Caesalpinus  's sole reason for establishing of  Daemons  according to  Aristotle  's Doctrine may be solv'd Yet however since  Aristotle  admits the Facts commonly ascrib'd to  Daemons  I see not why he may not properly enough be said to have had a  Genius  tho' it may be explain'd by an  Intellectus Agens  coming from without or by an orderly influx from the Intelligences that move the Heav'ns he having a mind to set up for himself by an hypothesis of his own contrary to that of  Plato  receiv'd before and  which is more consonant to Christianity Nor can I think  Aristotle  's so plausible for solving  Phaenomena  tho' it may more gratify the Humour of some Persons In reference to  Aristotle's Genius  I may add what  Rhodiginus  writes  viz  That among the Ancients  L  ct Antiq l    c    Plato  had the Symbol of  Divine  given him and  Aristotle  of  Daemonical  the reason why  Aristotle  was so stil'd seems to be that he chiefly treated of natural things the consideration of which lies in a manner in the sublunary World where they thought  Daemons  had their abode But  Plato  raising himself higher being addicted to the Contemplation of Intelligible Beings got him a more eminent guide of Life and despising those things which others admir'd even to a Madness he strove with all his force to bring that which is Divine in us to that Divine Being which only is truly so whence he got his name of  Divine    Naudaeus  after he has rejected the  Genius  of  Aristotle  proceeds to the others but first tells us That what all the  Platonicks  have set forth concerning  Daemons  and  Magick  can neither be prov'd by Reason nor Experience and as for the Reason they draw from many Effects which they say must necessarily be referr'd to these Causes before he obliges himself to receive it he first wishes they would well satisfy  Pomponatius Cardan  and  Bernardus Mirandulanus  who shew pertinently enough that its better to have recourse to the Proofs of our Religion to believe  Angels  and  Daemons  than to that heap of Experiences of which a reason may be rendred by the Principles of Natural Philosophy After which he says We  ought no longer to make doubt but all that is said of the  Genii  of  Plotinus Porphyrius  and  Jamblicus  ought to be referr'd to what he has said before concerning the  Daemon  of  Socrates    To this I reply that even setting by the Proofs of our Religion for  Angels  and  Daemons  I see not but as for solving the Experiences he speaks of by natural Principles  Aristotle  's  Hypothesis of Intelligences  moving the Heavens is altogether as precarious and less satisfactory than the other us'd by others of the  Gentiles  And as for his referring what is said of the  Genii  of the three Philosophers beforemention'd to what he has said of the  Genius  of  Socrates  I think I have shewn above that he has not validly refuted his  Daemon    As to the  Genius  of  Plotinus Porphyrius  his Scholar who has writ his Life which is prefix'd to  Plotinus  's Works set forth with Commentaries by  Ficinus  says thus in it  An  Egyptian  Priest coming to  Rome  and being soon made known by a Friend of his to  Plotinus  and having a desire to shew a Specimen of his Wisdom at  Rome  perswaded  Plotinus  to go along with him and he would presently shew him his  Daemon  or  Familiar Spirit  whom  Plotinus  readily obey'd The Invocation of the  Daemon  was made in the Temple of  Isis  for  Plotinus  said this was the sole place in  Rome  which the  Egyptian  sound pure But when the  Daemon  was call'd to present himself to his view instead of a  Daemon  a God appear'd which was not of the Species of  Daemons  the  Egyptian  thereupon thus presently cry'd out  You are happy  O Plotinus  who have a God for your  Daemon  and have not light on a Guide  of an Inferior kind    Plotinus  therefore having a Familiar of the Order of Divine  Daemons  it was with reason that he always sublimely rais'd the Divine Eye of his Mind to that and for this reason he afterwards compos'd a Book concerning each Man's particular  Daemon  where he endeavours diligently to assign the Causes of the difference of Familiar Spirits  Porphyrius  to shew the Divine Spirit of his Master  Plotinus  adds beneath  I had once thoughts of killing my self which  Plotinus  wonderfully perceiv'd and as I was walking in the House he presently came to me and said  What you meditate  O Porphyrius  is not like that of a sound Mind but rather of a Mind grown mad with Melancholy  and therefore he commanded me to depart from  Rome    Those that would read  Plotinus  's Tract concerning each Man's  Familiar Spirit  may find it in his Works  Naudaeus  proceeds next to the  Genii  of  Chicus Scaliger  and  Cardan  As for  Chicus  he looks upon him by what he has writ as a Superstitious Person who affirm'd he often made use of Revelations from a Spirit call'd  Flo  on  which he said was of the Order of the  Cherubims  But  Naudaeus  rejects this with other fabulous Relations of other Persons saying with  Lucretius  Quis dubitat quin omne sithoc rationis aegestas  a short way of refuting  Concerning the  Genii  of  Scaliger  and  Cardan Naudaeus  writes as follows If it were permitted me and it became me to follow rather my will than my duty I should freely excuse  my self from saying any thing against the  Genii  which the two sole great Persons whom we may oppose to the two most learned and famous among the Ancients have attributed to themselves and who have been as it were the last effort and miracle of Nature  Scaliger  and  Cardan  for I certainly believe either they deceived themselves in admitting these  Genii  because after having well examined themselves they could not find in them the cause of such and so extraordinary Perfection or that they did it thro' modesty not to discover by their Learning how much all the rest of Mankind were inferior to them or finally that they would cover from envy under this particular assistance and free from the jealousy of Men that great renown they had acquir'd to themselves by their studious diligence and labours However as truth is sooner found out when many Persons employ themselves in the search of it the opinion of those is not to be rejected who say  Scaliger  practised this stratagem in imitation of all great Persons and not to yield in Ambition to his Antagonist attributing to himself for a  Genius    L    c    in his  Art of Poetry  a meer sally or emotion of Mind by which the Soul is heated as it were in it self to raise it to the knowledge of somewhat during which a Man may at any time say and write many things which he understands not after the heat of this enthusiasm is over And as for  Cardan  he speaks so variously of his  Genius  that after having said absolutely in his  Dialogue  entitl'd  Telion  that he had one which was  Venereal  mixt with  Saturn  and  Mercury  and in his Book  De libris propriis    that he communicated himself to him by his Dreams he doubts at the same place whether he had really one or whether it were the excellency of his Nature  I perceived  said he  whether it were from the  Genius  set over me or that my Nature is placed in the extremity of an human state and in the confines of the Immortals  c And finally concludes in his Book  De Rerum Varietate  that he had none frankly saying  I truly know not that any  Daemon  or  Genius  attends me  Whence we may surely judge that he and  Scaliger  had no other  Genius  but the great Learning they had acquired by their diligence and labours and the experience they had of things on which coming to raise their judgments as on two Pyramids they judg'd pertinently of all matters and let nothing escape from being known and manifest to them  We here see what conjectures  Naudaeus  has made concerning the  Genii  of these Men which are as easily rejected as they are groundlesly suggested by him And tho'  Cardan  says in his Book  De Rerum Varietate    L    he knew no  Genius  attended him we know that Book was writ many Years before he writ his Life which was but a little before his Death and on which I think we have most reason to rely where he plainly says he had a  Genius  tho' not well discovered by him till his latter Years And this Book writ by  Cardan  of his own Life was set forth by  Naudaeus  himself which makes it seem somewhat strange that he should deny he had any  Genius  But for the Readers satisfaction I shall here set down what these two great Men say themselves of their  Genii  and shall leave it to him to judge of it as he shall think fit  To pass by the  Genius  of  Facius Cardanus  which his Son  Hierom Cardan  says  L De Daemon  his Father own'd to have attended him for Thirty Years and where he gives an account of Seven  Daemons  more whom he saw and converst with I here give you several particulars tho' not all which  Hierom Cardan  has left recorded concerning a  Genius  that attended himself  In his Book of his own Life set forth by  Naudaeus    C    where he writes of his good Spirit he says its received as a manifest truth that familiar Spirits which the  Greeks  call  Angels  have forewarned some Men  Socrates Plotinus Synesius Dion Flavius Josephus  and even my self All lived happily besides  Socrates  and my self who neverthelses am in a very good condition but  C Caesar  the Dictator  Cicero Antony Brutus  and  Cassius  had evil tho' illustrious Spirits Those of  Antony  and  Cicero  were Glorious but both Pernicious that of  Josephus  was particularly famous and of a rare excellency for Warlike Valour favour with  Vespesian  and his Sons Riches Monuments of Histories a threefold Offspring and in his contest with the calamities of his Nation also in a foresight of future things wherewith he was illustrated in Captivity being freed from the outrage of his Friends and preserved from the Waves of the Sea But these were manifestly  Daemons  tho' mine as I believe a good and merciful Spirit I was long perswaded that I had one but could not find how he should certify me of imminent events till after the Seventy Fourth Year of my Age when I set upon writing  my Life but that so many imminent things should be foreknown to me and truly foreseen and that just before they happened and precisely seems to me a greater Miracle to be done without a Divine Aid than with a Spirit for Instance When my Spirit saw what was ready to befall me  viz  that my Son was to Marry the next day an Unfortunate Match in the Nighttime he raised such a beating of my Heart by a way peculiarly known to him that the Chamber seem'd to tremble my Son perceiving the same at the same time so that both of us thought there was an Earthquake which no body else perceived  He adds beneath There may be some doubts why this care for me and not for others for I do not excel in Learning as some think but haply on the contrary Is it an immence love of Truth and Wisdom with contempt of Riches even in this state of Poverty or by reason of my desire of Justice or that I ascribe all to God nothing to my self or haply for some end known to God alone  Again why does he not openly admonish me as I could wish of those things of which he does admonish me but teaches one thing for another as by those disorderly Noises  of which he gives several instances hapning before Deaths in his  d  Chapter of the same Book  for me to assure my self that God beholds all things tho' I see him not with my Eyes for he could have admonish'd me openly by a  Dream  or some clearer way of manifestation but haply this shew'd more the Divine Care and those greater things that hapned  to me Fears Impediments Anxieties  c  there is need also of Obscurity for us to understand that they are the Works of God and ought not to be opposed its folly therefore to be overhastily sollicitous for knowing these things  At the end of the same Chapter he writes that having stuck to a splendor that attended him above Forty Years he had all his art of Writing and publick Teaching from his Spirit and Splendour tho' this kind of Science had got him among Men more Envy than Renown and more Glory than Profit but it gave him no small nor vulgar Pleasure and contributed to the prolonging of his Life being a comfort to him in many Calamities an aid in Adversities an help in Difficulties and Labours upon the whole he says the fact was plainly so he might err in the Causes and refers himself to such as are Wiser  viz  Divines  In the same Book he writes thus Hitherto I have spoken of my self  Chap    as of a Man and that is somewhat beneath other Men in my Nature and Learning but now I shall speak of some admirable Disposition of my self and so much the more wonderful that I find somewhat in my self which I know not what to make off And that that thing is my self tho' I do not perceive such things to proceed from me That it's present when its meet and not when I will have it That which rises thence is greater than my Abilities which was first discover'd to me in the Year So that it's above Forty four Years since I perceive a thing from without enter into my Ear with a noise from that part directly  where People are talking of me If it tends to Good in the right side or if it comes from the left it penetrates to the right and an orderly noise is made And if the Discourse be contentious I hear a wonderful Contention if it inclines to Evil in the left side it comes exactly from the part where those tumultuous Voices are Therefore it enters on both sides of my Head and very often when the thing falls out ill the Voice on the left side when it should end grows louder and Voices are multiply'd and very commonly if the thing be in the same Town it happens that the Voice being scarce over a Messenger comes in to call me to them and if it be from another City and a Messenger comes upon computing the time betwixt the Deliberation and the beginning of the Journey they come to the same and I find Sentence past after the form it is concluded and this continued with me to the Year and I wondred it ceas'd  In the Year I began to see in Dreams what things would happen in a short time and if the same Day I saw them clearly and after Sun rising so that I saw a Sentence past in a Cause of the College and that I should be Professor at  Bononia  this ceas'd  An    The third thing was a Splendor this I encreas'd by Degrees it began about the Year or but particularly this Year it seems to me I have it perfect and it's a thing which does not leave me but instead of the two foregoing which are ceas'd it fortifies me against Emulators and as necessity requires Its compos'd of an Artifical Practice and a Circumfluent Light being very Pleasant  and alone performs much more as to Efficacy Exercitation Advantage and Solidity of Studies than those two joyn'd together and does not take a Man from his common Studies and humane Conversation but makes him ready at all things and is most excellent for composing Books and seems as it were the utmost reach of our Nature for it represents all things together that make for the matter under Consideration and if it be not a Divine thing certainly it's the most perfect of Mortal Works  Chap    In the same Book he writes as follows While I liv'd at  Pavia  and profest Physick there looking casually on my Hand I saw at the root of my ring Finger of my right Hand the form of a bloody Sword I was presently struck with a great fear In the Evening a Messenger came with a Letter from my Son in Law acquainting me that my Son was taken into Custody and that I should come to  Milan  the next Day and for fifty three Days the Mark increas'd and went upwards and behold the last Day reacht to the top of my Finger and look'd red like a flaming Sword I suspecting no such thing and being frighted and not my self knew not what to do say or think at midnight my Son was beheaded in the Morning the Sign was almost gone in a Day or two it wholly vanish'd  In the same Book having giv'n an account of some strange Noises  Chap    and Voices he had heard and of a strange Smell he perceiv'd before Deaths he concludes thus But conc  ning th  se wonderful things it's thus with Men tha  when they are present or a lit+tle  before they have happ'ned they draw the whole Man after they are a while over they are so little heeded that unless they are brought fresh to the Mind by some force they doubt as it were whether they have seen or heard them which I suppose chiefly happens both by Reason of much more profound Causes and for the distance of our Nature from the Causes that produce them I know what Scoffs and Laughter some that would seem wise raise at such things the chief ring Leader of whom is  Polybius  a Philosopher without Philosophy who understood not even the Duty of an Historian but by extending it too far became ridiculous sometimes admirable as where he speaks of the  Achaeans  In short  L    Hist  Tartalia  rightly said that noMan knows all things and those nothing that do not know their Ignorance of many things You see  Pliny  who has deliver'd so clear an History shews himself a Blockhead where he treats of the Sun and Stars what wonder therefore that  Polybius  while he meddles of the more sublime and Divine things has so clearly expos'd his Ignorance I religiously Swear that a Sense and Consciousness of only one of these things is more dear to me than a long lasting Reign over the whole Earth would be And beneath but let this suffice for I have only here set down in short when these things happen'd and how and such in which these could be no Suspiscion of Error or Imposture and I only beg you Reader when you read such things do not propose humane Pride for your Scope but the greatness and amplitude of the World and of the Heavens and the vile Darkness in which we live and you  will easily Understand I have related no incredible things The same Author in his Dialogue intitl'd  Tetim  or of  Humane Counsels  where he makes  Tetim  and  Ram  Interlocutors makes  Ram  say I believe  Cardan  has a  Genius  for his Companion which discover'd himself late to him being wont before to admonish him by Dreams and Noises and beneath so many and so wonderful things have happen'd to him in his Life that I am forc'd to believe being intimate with him he has a great powerful and rare  Genius  so that he is not Master of his Actions but those things he desires he has not the things he has he did not covet or hope for  At the end of his fourth Book of  Wisdom  he writes as follows concerning the  Genii  of other Men All great Men seem to be led by some Divine Spirit or  Daemon Socrates  before his Death had warning of the Day in a Dream  Dion  saw a  Spectre  in his House what was it open'd  Caius Caesar  's door the Night before he was slain What was it said to  Brutus  as he was alone I am thy Evil  Genius  thou shalt see me again at  Philippi  What was that august Figure seen by  Cassius  in his Tent that was like to  Caesar  What foretold  Sylla  in his Dream of his imminent Death Or what was it he heard so Pleasant in a clear Sky What from a  Mausolaeum  call'd  Nero  before his Death What admonish'd  Caligula  of his Death in a Dream Why did  Antony  hear the departure of  Bacchus  from  Alexandria  the Night before his Death What mixt a sleeping Potion for  Adrian  in a Dream before his Death Certainly the  Daemon  that was in them for Humane Nature when highly exalted  rises to the force of a  Daemon  These foresaw their Deaths but could not prevent the violence of it Neither are these the only Persons who having this Wisdom have had violent ends For  Paul  who aided by the Divine Spirit could see the Secrets of God and  Stephen  the Heavens open and  Philip  who was carry'd invisible through the Desart died all by the Hands of others But there is this great difference betwixt these Spirits that the Divine is joyn'd with Justice and Piety and the other Vertues and has tranquility and rest always attending it the  Daemonical  is rais'd by Murthers Robberies and Falsedealings and is always accompanyed with suspiscious and manifold Disquiets Who but a Person of troubled Senses and a discompos'd Mind would chuse to embrace the  Daemonical  But as in sick Persons the vitiated taste abhors Sweet and Fat things and is more delighted with such as are sharp and insipid so the Nature of Mortals being corrupted with Vice abhors the best and adheres to the worst and this is done chiefly by the likeness of these two kinds which how great it is may easily be understood by this that  Simon  and  Elimas  the  Magicians  were accounted Divine Men and  Christ  who was God was thought by many to have a Devil And so much for  Cardan    Scaliger    L    c    speaking of the  Genius  ascrib'd by  Virgil  to  A  nea  viz  Achates  so called from  writes thus of the  Genii  that attend Men We read in the Books of the  Pythagoreans  enricht by the  Platonicks  that we have two  Genii  attending us a Good and a Bad by the guidance and counsels of the Good Good and Elect Persons joyn themselves to God from whom  they have received him as a Mediator To some  Heroes  he shews himself by others he is never seen but is heard which  Socrates  professes of his in more than one place in  Plato  by some Divine Spirits he is neither seen nor heard but so introduces and presents himself that by his light he discovers an intelligence of secret things for Men to write wherefore it often happens that when that Celestial Heat is over in us we our selves either admire those our Writings or do not own them for ours and do not understand some things after the way they were directed and dictated by him nor do I think it hapned otherwise to  Plato  to whose Writings a light is added by Interpreters much greater than may proceed from vulgar judgments As for my self who think I am not to be compared even with the least if any thing falls from me at any time unawares I may not hope so much may be performed by me afterwards which is the reason I never set upon meditating or writing unless invited by my  Genius  who speaks inwardly with me tho' not heard shewing the spacious fields of the Divinity in our Minds which being abstracted and suspended from the offices of the Body it deputes to other Functions so that he did not speak wholly at random who thought that  Aristotle  's  Intellectus Agens  were the same with  Plato's Genius  we have instances of both in History for an Evil one appear'd to  Brutus  and foretold him an unhappy end A Good one to  Caesar  when he past  Rubicon  shewing him the way to that in which he plac'd his chief bliss  c  Heinsius  says in a manner  In Dedic Hippon sui  the same thing of himself with  Scaliger  writing thus Here are some things to which being my self I am not able to aspire which after the heat has left my Mind I consider as a Reader of another Man's Works  Exer    Scaliger  also elsewhere calls his  Genius  most Learned whose desire is vast and immence And  Heinsius  says  Ib  uninitiated Persons do not understand these things  Scaliger  also on  Aristotle De Plantis    P    in f  writes thus  Jamblicus  in his  Mysteries  says he that being inspir'd receives the Deity has a sort of appearance of Fire before its ingress and it's seen the God either coming or departing therefore those Spirits that apply themselves to our Mind with Darkness bring us frivolous wavering and doubtful things And I know a Person to whose Eyes a Fire presents it self often either meditating or expecting Messengers  This is what  Scaliger  and  Cardan  have said concerning their own  Genii  and those of others from which the judicious Reader may easily discern their sense concerning them  CHAP III What perception Men have had of  Genii  or  Spirits  and their operations by the Sight  AS I come now to give an account of the perception Men have had of  Genii  or Spirits and their operations by their particular senses I shall begin with the most spiritualized sense  viz  the Sight and set forth what perception Men have had of them by that and whereas in my account according to the several senses it may sometimes happen that more than one sense may be concerned at one and the same time in a perception of them I shall entitle the Chapters according to the predominant sense in that Action And whereas it often happens that some particular Persons have a perception of Spirits both by the Sight and Hearing when other Persons present perceive nothing I shall treat of these Persons in particular Chapters  To begin therefore with instances of Persons perceiving Spirits by the Sight  Cam panella  tells us  De Sens Rer l    c    there are  Angel Guardians  for each  Species  and individual Person as St  Hierom  writes and himself has found by experience which he did not understand be+fore  In the same work  L    c    he tells us of a Friend of his who was no ignorant nor timerous Person nor given to speak untruths who assured him he had often seen and conversed with Evil  Daemons  and he says he met with many others afterwards who had been incredulous in this kind but upon their seeing and conversing with Spirits chang'd their Opinions and their Lives  Elsewhere he writes thus  Ib l    c    Porphyrius  and  Plotinus  say there are  Angels  Good and Bad as daily experience teaches and my self also have found by manifest experience not when I greatly endeavoured it but when I was minding another thing and therefore it's no wonder if they did not appear to curious  Nero    In his  Atheismus Triumphatus    C    he also tells us of a Friend of his that had a sensible experience of Spirits whose Voice he used to hear betwixt sleeping and waking and especially when any evil was to happen to him  Father  Le Brun  Printed a Book two Years  Paris  in  French  which has for Title  Critique des pratiques superstitieuses  c in th  Second part of this Book  Chap  he writes concerning  Trithemius  as follows The Abbot  Trit  mius  after an ardent desire of know  unknown to all Mankind learned such a  were Astonishing by a Revelation which has no way the character of being Divine I examine not whether all he said he had learnt be natural I know some Persons pretend it but it's plain it was without making a due reflection However it may be I shall only speak of the manner after which  Trithemius  learnt these Secrets He Writ  it confidently to a  Carmelite  Father a Friend of his call'd  Borstius  who died at  Ghent  before the Letter came to him It was open'd and communicated to many Persons and  Trithemius  did not disown it I have in hand says he in his Letter a great Work which will amuse the whole World if ever it sees the Light it's divided into Four Books and the First has for Title of it  Steganography  the Work throughout is full of great and astonishing things which Man has never heard of and will seem incredible If you ask me how I learnt these things It's not by Man but by the Revelation of I know not what Spirit for thinking on a day this Year if I could not discover secrets unknown to Men after having a long while ponder'd on those I have mentioned and being at length perswaded that what I sought for was not possible I went to Bed being somewhat ashamed for having carried my Folly so far as to attempt an Impossible thing In the Nighttime some one presented himself to me and calling me by my name  Trithemius  said he do not believe you have had all these thoughts in vain tho' the things you search are not possible to you nor to any other Man they will become so  Teach me then I reply'd what I must do to succeed  Then he laid open the whole Mystery and shew'd me that nothing was more easy God is my Witness that I speak the Truth and that I have taught these Secrets but to a Prince who by an evident proof has been convinced of the possibillity of it It Imports that none but Princes should know these sorts of Secrets least  Traitors Impostors or other Ill Men make use of them for doing many Mischiefs  Boissardus L de Magia Geniis Angelis    C    mentions this Letter of  Trithemius  and says he there adds that he could teach all the things he had of the Spirit in all the Languages of the World and that he clears himself of the Crime of Magick and any commerce with Evil Spirits by a Sacred Oath and Execration  Apol des Grands homines  c  p    c    Naudaeus  writes that  Trithemius  indeed lay under a suspicion of Magick on the account of that Letter and endeavours to clear him of it but I leave it to the Readers to consider what  Trithemius  's Words import as to a conversation with some Spirit be he Good or Bad  The same  Boissardus  writes  C    that an Illustrious  German  Count whom he knew profest he had a  Familiar Spirit  whom he affirm'd to be of the Celestial Order whose Counsel he used in all things he undertook at home and abroad  Philip Melancthon  tells us  L de Anime  that he had seen  Spectres  and that he knew many Men worthy of credit who affirm'd they had not only seen  Spectres  but had likewise discoursed with them So  Maximus Tyrius  says he saw  Aesculapius  but it was in a Slumber  Serm    but  Hercules  he saw as he was Waking  There was a Pamphlet Printed in  London Anno  in  Quarto  Entitled  A True and exact Relation of the several Informations Examinations and Confessions of the late Witches Arraigned and Executed in the County of  Essex  Who were Arraigned and Condemned at the late Sessions held at  Chelmsford  before the Right Honourable  Robert Earl of Warwick    and several of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace  July  the  th    Before this Sessions several Informations concerning Witches and their Practises were taken before Sir  Harbottel Grimston  and Sir  Thomas Bowes  His Majesty's Justices of Peace for the said County Some of which Informations are as follows  I  The Information of  Matthew Hopkins  of  Manningtree  Gent Taken upon Oath before us the  th  of  March    This Informant saith that the said  Elizabeth Clarke  alias  Beddingfield  suspected for a Witch as aforesaid and whose Mother and some others of her Kinsfolk did suffer Death for Witchcraft and Murther being by appointment of the said Justices watcht several Nights for the better discovery of her wicked Practises This Informant came into the Room where the said  Elizabeth  was watcht as aforesaid the last Night being the  th  of this Instant  Marc  but intended not to have stay'd long there but the said  Elizabeth  forthwith told this Informant and one Mr  Sterne  there present if they would stay and do the said  Elizabeth  no hurt she would call one of her white  Imp  and play with it in her Lap but this Informant told her they would not allow of it but that staying there a while longer within a quarter of an Hour after there appeared an  Imp  like to a Dog which was White with some Sandy Spots and seem'd to be very Fat and Plump with very short Legs and forthwith Vanisht away and the said  Eliz  beth  said the name of that  Imp  was  Jarm  ra    and immediately there appeared another  Imp  which she called  Vinegar Tom  in the shape of a Greyhound with long Legs and the said  Elizabeth  then said that the next  Imp  should be a black  Imp  and should come for the said Mr  Sterne  which appeared but presently Vanisht and the last that appeared was in the shape of a Polecat but the Head somewhat bigger and the said  Elizabeth  then told this Informant that she had five  Imps  of her own and two of the  Imps  of the Old Bedlam  West  meaning one  Ann West  Widow who is now also suspected to be guilty of Witchcraft and said sometimes the  Imps  of the Old Bedlam Suck'd on the said  Elizabeth  and sometimes her  Imps  Suck'd on the Old Beldam  West  and the said  Elizabeth  farther told this Informant that Satan would never let her be at rest or quiet till she did consent to the Killing of the Hogs of one Mr  Edwards  of  Mannintree  and the Horse of one  Robert Taylor  of the same Town  II  The Information of  John Sterne  Gent Taken upon Oath before us the  th  Day of  March    This Informant saith that Watching with  Elizabeth Clarke  suspected for Witchcraf as aforesaid she desired this Informant and the rest that were in the Room with her to sit down and said she would shew this Informant and the rest some of her  Imps  and within half an Hour there appear'd a white thing in the likeness of a Cat but not altogether so big and being ask'd if she would not be afraid of her  Imps  she answer'd  what do you think I am afraid of my Children and that she call'd the name of that white  Imp Hoult  And this Informant farther saith that presently after there appear'd another white  Imp  with Red Spots as big as a small Dog which she then called  Jarmara  and that immediately after there appear'd at the Threshold of the Door another  Imp  about the bigness of the first but did presently Vanish away and then the said  Elizabeth  being ask'd if any more  Imps  would come she answer'd that  Vinegar Tom  would come by and by and forthwith there appear'd another in the likeness of a Dumb Dog somewhat bigger than any of the former and the said  Elizabeth  also told this Informant that she had three  Imps  from her Mother which were of a Brown Colour and two from the Old Beldam  West  and that there had five  Imps  appear'd but she had one more call'd  Sack and Sugar  which had been hard at Work and it would be long before it came but it should Tear this Informant  III  The Information of  Frances Mills Grace Norman Mary Phillips  and  Mary Parsley  Taken upon Oath before the said Justices the  th  Day of  March    These Informants say joyntly that watching with the said  Elizabeth Clarke  suspected as aforesaid about Twelve of the Clock last Night the said  Elizabeth  smack'd with her Mouth and beckon'd with her Hand and Instantly there appear'd a white thing about the bigness of a Cat and that these Informants  saw five  Imps  more which the said  Elizabeth  named as abovesaid  c  IV  The Information of  Edward Parsly  of  Mannintree  Taken upon Oath before the said Justices the  th  of  March    This Informant saith that watching with the said  Elizabeth Clarke  the last Night he ask'd her if he should continue still in the Room with her and the said  Elizabeth  desired he should if he would Fight for her with the Devils for they would come this Night and that which she call'd  Hoult  would come first and then that which she call'd  Jarmara  which did appear in the likeness of a white Dog with red Spots and presently after there appear'd that  Imp  which she call'd  Vinegar Tom  and then that which she call'd  Sack and Sugar  and the said  Elizabeth  then told this Informant that the Devil had had possession of her Six or Seven Years and that he had oftentimes knock'd at her Door in the Nighttime and that she did rise open the Door and let him in and that he went to Bed to her three or four times a Week and had the Carnal knowledge of her as a Man  V  The Information of  John Banks  of  Mannintree  Taken upon Oath before the said Justices the  th  of  March    This Informant saith that watching with the said  Elizabeth Clarke  he did Inform and Confirm all the particulars exprest and set down in the Information of the said Mr  Sterne    To the Five Informations before set down I shall add the Examination of  Ann Leech  of  Misley  in the County aforesaid Widow taken before the said Justices  April  the  th  as follows  This Examinant saith That she had a  Grey Imp  sent her and that she together with  Elizabeth Clarke  and  Elizabeth Gooding  did about a Year since fend their  Imps  to kill a Black Cow and a White Cow belonging to Mr  Edwards  which was done accordingly and says That she sent her  Grey Imp Elizabeth Clarke  a  Black Imp  and  Elizabeth Gooding  a  White Imp  and that about Years since she sent a  Grey Imp  to kill two Horses of one Mr  Bragg  of  Misley  which were kill'd accordingly That she and the said  Elizabeth Gooding  sent either of them an  Imp  to destroy the Child of the said Mr  Edwards  this Examinants  Imp  being a White one and  Elizabeth Gooding  's a Black  Imp  and that about thirty Years since this Examinant had the said  White Imp  and two others a  Grey  and a  Black  Imp of one  Anne  the Wife of  Robert Pierce  of  Stoake  in  Suffolk  being her Brother and that these  Imps  went commonly from one to another and did mischief whereever they went And that when this Examinant did not employ them abroad to do mischief she had not her Health but when they were employ'd she was healthful and well and these  Imps  did usually suck those Teats which were found about the privy Parts of her Body and that those  Imps  did often speak to this Examinant and that in an  Hollow Voice  which she plainly understood  c  she  was executed at  Chelmsford  as also  Elizabeth Clarke  before mention'd  Now as to the five Informations before set down in which Eight Persons are concern'd all given in upon Oath that they saw such  Imps  as they mention I cannot well conceive what an opposer of any real Apparitions of Spirits can say for here I do not tell you of afflicted Persons who pretended to see  Spectres  which were seen by none but themselves nor of an Old distracted Woman who fancies she has and sees Spirits attending her when there is no such thing Nor do I give you the Testimonies of Crafty Melancholy Wenches or Old Women as some such there may have been but here are the Testimonies of Eight unexceptionable Persons as I conceive concurring in one thing And if this be not a fair Proof I know not what is so  As to the Examination of  Anne Leech  concerning her  Imps  though the Fact stands but upon her Testimony yet in regard it relates to somewhat that I shall write elsewhere in this Book I thought fit to insert it And I here forbear to insert the Spirits raised by Mrs  Bodman  who was executed at  Salisbury  for which Fact there was also but one Testimony  Sometime since I drew the Account before set down from the foremention'd Pamphlet printed  Anno  I casually met with a Pamphlet publish'd in  London Anno  by Mr  Stearne  above mentioned the Title of it is  A Confirmation and discovery of Witchcraft  c  by  John Stearne  now of  LawsHall  near  Bury St Edmonds  in  Suffolk  sometimes of  Manningtree  in  Essex  In this  Pamphlet  among other things he gives an Account of the Facts abovementition'd as follows  Mr  Hopkin  and my self went together to  Elizabeth Clarke  of  Manningtree  in  Essex  who had been kept three Days and three Nights under a guard and when I had ask'd her who she had accus'd as Witches we were going away but she said to us if you will stay I will shew you my  Imps  for they are ready to come then said Mr  Hopkin Besse  Will you do us no harm No said she What Do you think I am afraid of my Children You shall sit down so we did where she appointed us then one of the Company who was appointed to be with her that Night said to her  Besse  I ask'd you a Question of late but you answer'd not then she said What is it He reply'd tell the Truth has not the Devil had the use of your Body She said Why should you ask me such a Question He answer'd I desire to know the Truth and no otherwise then she fetch'd a deep Sigh and said it is true then said Mr  Hopkin  in what manner and likeness came he to you She said like a Tall Proper Blackhair'd Gentleman a Properer Man than your self and being ask'd which she had rather lie withal she said the Devil and so particulariz'd every thing and how he came in and his Habit and how he lay with her and spake to her and she then affirm'd this to be Truth and so presently fell a smacking with her Lips and call'd  Lought  two or three times which presently appeared to us eight for there were six which were appointed to be with her that Night before we went in the likeness of a Cat for she  told us before in what shapes they would come and so that presently vanish'd Then she call'd again as before  Jarmara  Then appear'd another like a Red or Sandy spotted Dog with Legs not so long as a Finger to our perceivance but his back as broad as two Dogs or broader of that bigness and vanish'd After that she call'd more as before by several Names which came in several shapes one like a Greyhound with Legs as long as a Stags another like a Ferrit and one like a Rabbit and so in several shapes they appear'd to us till there were some seven or eight seen Some by some of us and others by other some of us then I ask'd her if they were not all come for there were more come than she spake of she answer'd that they came double in several shapes but said one was still to come which was to tear me in pieces I ask'd her why she said because I would have had her try'd by Swimming and told me that now she would be even with me and so told in what manner it should come black and like a Toad and so afterwards it did come as the rest averr'd that saw it  c  This Account we find somewhat differs from the former but whether enough to invalidate the Testimony I must leave it to the Readers Consideration  Mr  Glanvil  in his Collections of Relations for proving Apparitions Spirits and Witches tell us of an  Irishman  that had like to have been carry'd away by Spirits and of the Ghost of a Man who had been seven Years dead that brought a Medicine to his Bedside The Relation is thus  A Gentleman in  Ireland  near to the Earl of  Orrery  's sending his Butler one Afternoon to buy Cards as he pass'd a Field to his wonder he espy'd a Company of People sitting round a Table with a deal of good Cheer before them in the midst of the Field And he going up towards them they all arose and saluted him and desir'd him to sit down with them but one of them Whisper'd these words in his Ear  Do nothing this Company invites you to  Hereupon he refus'd to sit down at the Table and immediately Table and all that belong'd to it were gone and the Company are now dancing and playing upon Musical Instruments And the Butler being desir'd to joyn himself with them but he refusing this also they all fall to Work and he not being to be prevail'd with to Accompany them in working any more than in feasting or dancing they all disappear'd and the Butler is now alone but instead of going forwards home he returns as fast as he could drive in a great Consternation and was no sooner entred his Master's Door but falls down and lay sometime Senseless but coming again to himself he related to his Master what had pass'd  The Night following there comes one of this Company to his Bedside and tells him  That if he offered to stir out of Doors the next Day he would be carryed away  Hereupon he kept within but towards the Evening having need to make Water he adventur'd to put one Foot over the Threshold several standing by which he had no sooner done but they espyed a Rope cast about his Middle and the Poor Man was hurried away with great Swiftness they following him as fast as they could but  could not overtake him at length they espy'd an HorseMan coming towards him and made signs to him to stop the Man whom he saw coming near him and both ends of the Rope but no Body drawing when they met he laid hold on one end of the Rope and immediately had a smart blow given him over his Arm with the other end but by this means the Man was stop'd and the HorseMan brought him back with him  The  Earl  of  Orrery  hearing of these strange Passages sent to the Master to desire him to send this Man to his House which he accordingly did and the Morning following or quickly after he told the  Earl  that his  Spectre  had been with him again and assur'd him that that Day he should most certainly be carry'd away and that no endeavours should avail to the saving of him upon this he was kept in a large Room with a considerable number of Persons to guard him among whom was the Famous Stroker Mr  Greatrix  who was a Neighbour There were beside other Persons of Quality two Bishops in the House at the same time who were consulted concerning the making use of a Medicine the  Spectre  or Ghost prescrib'd of which mention will be made anon but they determin'd on the Negative  Till part of the Afternoon were spent all was quiet but at length he was perceiv'd to rise from the Ground whereupon Mr  Greatrix  and another lusty Man clapt their Arms over his Shoulders one of them before him and the other behind and weigh'd him down with all their strength but he was forcibly taken up from them and they were too weak to keep their hold and for a considerable time  he was carryed in the Air to and fro over their Heads several of the Company still running under him to prevent his receiving hurt if he should fall at length he fell and was caught before he came to the Ground and had by that means no hurt  All being quiet till Bed time my  Lord  order'd two of his Servants to lye with him and the next Morning he told his  Lordship  that his  Spectre  was again with him and brought a Wooden Dish with grey Liquor in it and bid him Drink it off at the first sight of the  Spectre  he said he endeavour'd to awake his Bedfellows but it told him that that endeavour should be in vain and that he had no cause to fear him he being his Friend and he that at first gave him the good advice in the Field which had he not followed he had been before now perfectly in the Power of the Company he saw there he added That he concluded it was impossible but that he should have been carryed away the Day before there being so strong a Combination against him but now he could assure him that there would be more Attempts of that Nature but he being troubled with two sorts of sad Fits he had brought that Liquor to Cure him of them and bid him Drink it he peremptorily refusing the  Spectre  was angry and upbraided him with great Disingenuity but told him however he had a kindness for him and that if he would take Plantane Juice he should be well of one sort of Fits but he should carry the other to his Grave the Poor Man having by this time somewhat recover'd himself ask'd the  Spectre  whether by the Juice of Plantane he meant that of the Leaves or Roots It reply'd the Roots  Then it ask'd him whether he did not know him he aswered no it reply'd I am such an one the Man answered he had been long Dead I have been Dead said the  Spectre  or Ghost Seven Years and you know that I liv'd a loose Life and ever since I have been hurried up and down in a restless condition with the Company you saw and shall be to the day of Judgment then he proceeded to tell him that had he acknowledged God in his ways he had not suffer'd such severe things by their means and further said you never Pray'd to God that day before you met with this Company in the Fields  This Relation was sent to Dr  Henry More  by Mr  E Fowler  who said Mr  Greatrix  told it several Persons The Lord  Orrery  also own'd the Truth of it and Mr  Greatrix  told it to Dr  Henry More  himself who particularly enquired of Mr  Greatrix  about the Mans being carried up into the Air above Mens Heads in the Room and he did expresly affirm he was an Eyewitness thereof  Wierus  tells us that a Young Woman  De prestig Daem l    c    was miserably tormented with an Evil Spirit in the Castle of  Caldenbroc  in  Guelderland  and had been carried away in the Air by him if himself had not withheld her by Violence He says also that at  Magdeburg  a certain Magical Juggler  l    c    who was wont to lead about a little Horse for a Show would let him walk about in a Circle in an open Theatre and at the end of the Show w  ld tell the Company that he could get  little Money among Men and theref  he would go up to Heaven whereupon he w  ld throw a Cord up in the Air and the little  Horse would go up after it himself taking hold of the Horses Tayl would follow him his Wife taking hold of him would follow also and a Maid Servant would follow her and so mount up in the Air as it were link'd together the Spectators standing in great admiration till a certain Citizen coming by chance that way and asking what was done It was answered that a Jugler with his little Horse was gone up into the Air whereupon he assured them that he saw him just before going into an Inn in the Street therefore finding themselves deluded they went away  Wierus  adds no Man may deny but all this kind of allyance with  Daemons  by whatever means gotten and all the way of these delusions is a pestiferous Fraud introduc'd for the utter destruction of Men  Mr  Thomas Tilson  Minister of  Aylesworth  in  Kent  in a Letter dated  July  the  th  which he sent to the late Mr  Baxter  in  London  gives an Account of an Apparition at  Rochester  which Account Mr  Baxter  has Printed in his  Historical Discourse of Apparitions and Witches  It is as follows  Mary  the Wife of  John Goffe  of  Rochester  being Afflicted with a long Illness removed to her Fathers House at  WestMulling  which is about Nine Miles distant from her own there she Died  June  the  th  this present Year The day before her departure she grew very impatiently desirous to see her two Children whom she had left at home to the care of a Nurse she pray'd her Husband to hire an Horse for she must go home and Dye with the Children when they perswaded her to the contray telling her she  was not fit to be taken out of Bed nor able to sit on Horseback she entreated them however to try if I cannot sit said she I will lie along upon the Horse for I must go to see my Poor Babes  A Minister who lives in the Town was with her at Ten of the Clock that Night to whom she express'd good Hopes in the Mercies of God and Willingness to die but said she it is my Misery that I cannot see my Children  Between One and Two of the Clock in the Morning she fell into a Trance one Widow  Turner  who watch'd with her that Night says That her Eyes were open and fixt and her Jaw fall'n she put her Hand upon her Mouth and Nostrils but could perceive no Breath she thought her to be in a Fit and doubted whether she were alive or dead  The next Day this dying Woman told her Mother that she had been at home with her Children That is impossible said the Mother for you have been here in Bed all the while yes reply'd the other but I was with them last Night when I was a sleep  The Nurse at  Rochester  Widow  Alexander  by Name affirms and says she will take her Oath on't before a Magistrate and receive the Sacrament upon it that a little before Two of the Clock that Morning she saw the likeness of the said  Mary Goffe  come out of the next Chamber where the Elder Child lay in a Bed by it self the Door being left open and stood by her Bedside about a Quarter of an Hour the Younger Child was there lying by her her Eyes mov'd and her Mouth went but she said nothing The Nurse moreover  says that she was perfectly awake it was then Daylight being one of the longest Days in the Year She sate up in her Bed and look'd stedfastly upon the Apparition in that time she heard the Bridge Clock strike Two and a while after said  In the Name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost what art thou  Thereupon the Appearance remov'd and went away She slipt on her Cloaths and followed but what became on't she cannot tell then and not before she began to be grievously affrighted and went out of Doors and walk'd upon the Wharf the House being just by the River side for some Hours only going in now and then to look to the Children at Five of the Clock she went to a Neighbour's House and knock'd at the Door but they would not rise at Six she went again then they arose and let her in She related to them all that had pass'd they would perswade her she was mistaken or Dreamt but she confidently affirm'd If ever I saw her in all my Life I saw her this Night  One of those to whom she made the Relation  Mary  the Wife of  John Sweet  had a Messenger came from  Mulling  that Forenoon to let her know her Neighbour  Goffe  's Wife was dying and desir'd to speak with her she went over the same Day and found her departing The Mother among other Discourse related to her how much her Daughter had long'd to see the Children and said she had seen them This brought to Mrs  Sweet  's Mind what the Nurse had told her that Morning for till then she had not thought to mention it but disguis'd it rather as the Woman's disturb'd Imagination  The substance of this I had related to me by  John Carpenter  the Father of the Deceas'd next Day after her Burial  July  the  d  I fully Discours'd the Matter with the Nurse and two Neighbours to whose House she went that Morning  Two Days after I had it from the Mother the Minister that was with her in the Evening and the Woman that sate up with her that last Night they all agree in the same Story and every one strength'ns the others Testimony  They appear to be sober intelligent Persons far enough from designing to impose a Cheat on the World or to mannage a Lye and what Temptation they lie under for so doing I cannot conceive So far the Letter to Mr  Baxter    According to the foregoing instance  Helmont  tell us of a Boy who through an excussive desire of seeing his Mother fell into an Extasy and gave her a visit she being many Miles distant from him and that upon his coming to himself remembring all things he gave People many Marks of his having been with her  Marcus Marci    Phys vet rest part    having set down this Relation from  Helmont  adds though we should grant the Boy's Mind or Imagination had reach'd to that place it would be ridiculous to think he could have perceiv'd those sensible things being present unless we likewise admit the Organs of his Senses also with which he could have receiv'd those Images had pass'd thither Therefore we must say that as the Imaginative Faculty comes sometimes to the Knowledge of future things so it does to the Knowledge of things absent and as for the manner after which it is done he has explain'd it elsewhere  Captain  Henry Bell  in his Narrative prefixt to  Luther  's  Table  printed in English  An  having acquainted us how the  German  Copy printed of it had been discover'd under Ground where it had lain hid Fifty two Years that Edition having been supprest by an Edict of the Emperor  Rudolphus  the Second so that it was Death for any Person to keep a Copy thereof and having told us that  Casparus Van Sparr  a  German  Gentleman with whom he was familiarly acquainted while he negotiated Affairs in  Germany  for King  James  the First was the Person that discover'd it  An  and transmitted it into  England  to him and earnestly desir'd him to translate the said Book into  English  says he accordingly set upon the Translation of it many times but was always hindred from proceeding in it by some intervening Business About six Weeks after he had receiv'd the Copy being in Bed with his Wife one Night between Twelve and One of the Clock she being asleep but himself awake there appear'd to him an Ancient Man standing at his Bed'sside array'd all in White having a long and broad White Beard hanging down to his Girdle who taking him by his right Ear said thus to him Sirrah Will not you take time to translate that Book which is sent unto you out of  Germany  I will shortly provide for you both place and time to do it and then he vanish'd hereupon being much affrighted he fell into an extream Sweat so that his Wife awaking and finding him all over Wet she ask'd him what he ail'd He told her what he had seen and heard but he never regarded Visions nor Dreams and so the the same fell out of his Mind But a Fortnight  after being on a Sunday at his Lodging in  Kingstreet Westminster  at Dinner with his Wife two Messengers were sent from the whole Counsel Board with a Warrant to carry him to the  Gatehouse Westminister  there to be kept till farther Order from the Lords of the Council Upon which Warrant he was kept there ten whole Years close Prisoner where he spent five Years of it in translating the said Book having good cause to be mindful of the OldMan's saying I will shortly provide for you both place and time to translate it  Cardan  tells us That  Jacobus Donatus    De Rer variet l    c    a rich Senator of  Venice  was wont to relate how himself being in Bed with his Wife one Night and having a Wax Candle burning by him and two Nurses at the same time lying there in a TruckleBed with a Child under a Year old he saw the Chamber Door to be open'd by degrees and I know not what Man to put his Head in the Nurses saw him too but neither knew his Face the young Man being affrighted arose and snatch'd his Sword and Buckler and the Nurses each of them great Wax Candles he goes into the Hall adjoyning to the Chamber there he found all things fast shut he return'd with great Admiration The Infant who was well in Health dyed the next Day This he never related without sighing  We have also several instances in History of frightful  Spectres  appearing before Pestilences and other Afflictions  Procopius  where he writes of the great and wonderful Pestilence  De bell pe  s l    that in the time of  Cosree  and  Justinian  disp  opl'd the Earth says there were then seen publickly  and in private Houses  Daemons  in an Humane shape which struck those they met and those they struck were presently seiz'd with the Disease and this happen'd to some waking in open Day to others in the Night time  CHAP IV What Perception some Persons have had of  Genii  or Spirits by the Sense of seeing when others present at the same time have seen nothing  LUcas Jacobson Debes  M A and Provost of the Churches in the seventeen Islands of  Foeroe  subject to the King of  Denmark  in his Description of the said Islands and Inhabitants and his Account of several Observables there in his eighth Chapter tells us how Satan even since the pure Light of the Gospel there as well as before has behav'd himself in deluding and seducing those Inhabitants They having many Examples how he has taken away some and carry'd away others restoring them afterwards but weaken'd in their Understandings whereof he gives us some certain Relations that are yet in the Memory of Man and some others that happen'd while he himself was at  Foeroe  he tell us That Apparitions of Spirits is a thing so generally known in  Foeroe  that almost every where in the Country where they have read no Books  thereof nor heard any Relation from other Places know it so perfectly by the Works and Apparations of Satan that they are in no doubt at all of it And that they may be seen by some Persons and not by others might be prov'd by many Examples in  Foeroe  that being a meer endowment of their Nature and he says People grow much alter'd upon seeing such Apparitions which Apparitions they call  Hollow Men  An expression exactly agreeing with that of  Virgil  where he tells us what the  Sybil    Aen    who undertook to carry  Aen  as  to the  Elysian Fields  said to him at the entrance of Hell where the Ghosts came against him  Et ni docta comes tenues sine corpore vitas  Admoneat volitare cavâ sub imagine formae  Irruat frustra ferro dinverberet umbras  and such they always appear'd to my self not with solid Bodies of Flesh and Bones  For particulars I refer the Reader to Mr  Debes  's Book and shall only set down one Relation from him of a thing which happen'd  An  It is as follows A Person call'd  Jacob Oluffon  being then at  Giow  in  Osteroe  in the  th  Year of his Age on the  th  of  Jan  fell into a Sickness lying a Bed during a Fortnight and on the  th  Day of his Illness as he lay asleep at Night there came one into him with shining Cloaths on whereat he awaken'd and perceiv'd him in that Figure in the Bed by him the Room appearing full of Splendor and it ask'd the Man where his Pain was Whereunto he answer'd nothing afterwards the Apparition stroak'd him with his Hand along  his Breast and round about whereby he was presently heal'd  Now though  Daemonologers  generally give instances of some Persons seeing Spirits when others in the same Room at the same time see them not and some Men undertake by  Physiognomy  to tell who shall have Visions of Spirits or Angels and who shall never see Apparitions of them though they are in the Room with others that see them yet the most convincing instance of this peculiar Sight that I know of in the World is that of the  Second sighted Persons  in  Scotland  who are call'd  Second sighted  because they have the Gift of seeing more than others can that are with them  My late Friend Mr  John Aubrey  at the end of his Book of  Miscellanies  Printed in  London An  gives an Account of these  Second sighted Persons  which was sent him from a Learned Person in  Scotland  whose Letters he shew'd me before he Printed them And I shall here set down a few Particulars taken from that Account relating to my purpose  I They generally term this Second sight in Irish  Taishitaraugh  and such as have it  Taishatrim  from  Taish  which is properly a shadowy Substance and such as can only be some way discern'd by the Eye but not lay'd hold on by the Hands for which they assign'd it to  Bugles  or  Ghosts  so that  Taishtar  is as much as one that converses with Ghosts or Spirits or as they commonly call them the  or  Fairyfolks  others call these Persons  sichin  from  Phis  which is properly foresight or foreknowledge  II Those that have the  Second sight  see a multitude of Men and Women Night and Day round about them and a particular Relation is made of one of those Persons a Man of an upright Conversation who us'd ordinarily by looking to the Fire to foretel what Strangers would come to his House the next Day or shortly after by their Habit and Arms and sometimes also by their Names and if any of his Goods or Cattle were missing he would direct his Servants to the very place where to find them whether in a Mire or upon dry Ground he would also tell if the Beast were already dead or if it should die e're they could come at it and in the Winter if himself with others with him sate thick about the Fireside he would desire them to make Room for some others that stood by though they did not see them He saw two Spirits continually and sometimes many more though others say he continually saw more and would often seem very angry and something troubl'd nothing visible to others moving him The two particular Spirits that constantly attended him were call'd one  Brownie  in the shape of a  Boy  the other  Meig Malloch  or  Meg Mullack  in the shape of a  Girl  who were two Ghosts which as it's constantly reported of Old haunted a Family in  Straths Pey  of the Name of  Grant  of which Name and Family this Person was  Note  L    C    That King  James  in his  Daemonology  mentions also a Spirit call'd  Brownie  that was wont formerly to haunt divers Houses without doing any Evil but doing as it were necessary turns up and down the House he appear'd like a rough Man nay some believ'd  that their House was all the  Sonsier  as they call'd it that is the more lucky or fortunate that such Spirits resorted there  III As to the extent of these Peoples knowledge this secret way it reaches both present pass'd and future Events They foresee Murthers Drownings Weddings Burials Combats Manslaughters  c  of all which there are many instances to be given they commonly foresee sad Events a little while before they happen for instance if a Man's fatal end be hanging they'll see a Gibbet or a Rope about his Neck if beheading they'll see a Man without a Head if drowning they'll see Water up to his Throat if stabbing they'll see a Dagger in his Breast if unexpected Death in his Bed they'll see a Winding Sheet about his Head They foretel not only Marriages but of good Children what kind of Life Men shall lead and in what Condition they shall die also Riches Honours Preferments Peace Plenty and good Weather There is one instance of a  Second sighted Person  who saw a young Man attending a young Gentlewoman as she went up and down the House and this was about three Months before her Marriage with him and sometimes they foretel things which fall out several Years after It's likewise usual with Persons that lose any thing to go to some of these Men by whom they are directed how with what Persons and in what place they shall find their Goods It's also to be noted that this Gift bears a Latitude so that some have it in a far more Eminent degree than others  IV As for the way of receiving this Gift and communicating it to others the Account  tells us that in the Isle of  Skye  especially before the Gospel came thither several Families had it by Succession descending from Parents to Children and as yet there are many that have it that way So  Cardan  tell us it runs in a Blood among the  Turks    De Rer varit l    c    for Persons to cast themselves into an Extasy at Pleasure Some say they get this Gift by compact with the Devil others say by converse with those  Daemons  we call  Fairies  They say they can communicate the Gift to others in a few Days and have offer'd to do it for a small Matter and they say that if at any time when they see those strange sights they set their foot on the foot of another who has not the second sight that other will for that time see what they are seeing And as I am told by a Person who has convers'd with those  Second sighted Persons  the Gift will continue with the Man that has so receiv'd it all his Life  V This Gift is very troublesome to those that have it and they would gladly be rid of it for if the object be a thing that is terrible they are seen to sweat and tremble and screek at the Apparition at other times they laugh and tell of the thing cheerfully just according as the thing is Pleasant or astonishing A certain Person desir'd a  Second sighted M  n  to teach him his Skill who told him he could do it in three Days time but said he would not advise him or any Man to learn it for upon learning it he would never be a minute in his Life but he would see innume  ble Men and Women Night and Day round about him which he believ'd would be troublesome to him Whereupon the Person  would not learn it And those that have it wish to be rid of it judging it a Sin and that it came from the Devil and some of them have apply'd themselves to the Ministry desiring their Prayers for their being freed of it and they have been freed accordingly In the Isle of  Skye  if a Woman has it her self and be marryed to a Man that has it also unless a Child of theirs be baptiz'd just upon the delivery he has it all his Life if he be then baptiz'd he is freed from it  VI The Persons that have this Gift are observ'd for the most part to be vicious tho' some very honest Persons of an upright life have it  Mr  Aubrey  in a small Addition which he has  nnext to his  Account  of  Second sighted Persons  gives us a Relation from  Diembroke    L de Peste  of an old Woman with whom it was usual where any Friend of hers dyed to see their Apparitions without an Head and this though the Persons were never so far off And I have been credibly inform'd of a Gentleman in the  LowCountries  who as he walk'd the Streets of a Town would often meet People without Heads as it seem'd to him and would ask the next Person he met with who such Persons were and would acquaint his Friends that those Persons would die within a Year which always came to pass  Relating to this we find it's a Custom with the  Jews  on the th Day of their Feast of  Tabernacles  viz the st Day of the Month of  Sept  to go forth in the Night time in the Moonshine because they think all things that will happen to them that Year are reveal'd to them that Night in the Moonshine  Leusden  in his  hilologus  Hebraeo mixtus    Dissert  ·  has giv'n us a cut of this Practice which I have also here inserted Where  Jews  are going forth in the Moonshine with Branches of Palms Olives and Willows in their Hands to search out the Events of the whole Year but the Head of one of them lies hid and is not seen in the shadow whence the Person concludes he shall die that Year  Buxtorf  in his  Synagoga Judaica    Chap    thus sets forth all these things They go forth in the Night time in the Moonshine some having only their Heads bare some with a Shirt on only or also naked having a Sheet about them which they let fall and stretch forth their Arms and Hands if any Man's Head be seen wanting in the shadow he is in danger of Life and it's a sign he will die that Year if a Finger be wanting the Death of a Friend is foreshown if the righthand a Son if the left a Daughter will die if he see no shade at all he must prepare for Death for there is no hope of avoiding it and if he be upon undertaking a Journey it's a sign he will never return home  c  This the  Rabbins  make out from the Words  Numb    Their shadow is departed from them  but they write it is not to be understood of the  simple shadow  because it cannot be but a Man must see his shadow in the Moonshine but of the  shadow of the shadow  for if it be well minded we shall find a twofold shadow whereof the second is a Reflection of the first which the  Rabbins  call the shadow of the shadow  I know not how far this may relate to the Doctrine of the  Cabalis  s    L de Divin  c  chap    for as  Bo  ssardus  tells us the  Ar  bian  Priests held with them that there are Three parts of the Soul the First is called  Neschama  and is wholy Divine abstracted  and separated from the Body this  Virgil  calls  Aurai simplicis Ignem    Aen    The Second is called  Ruah  and it is the Rational Soul which partakes of the Divinity and the Body joyning both together with a wonderful Harmony it gives Life to the Body and causes that it has not an abhorrence for the Frail and Mortal Flesh in which it lives The Third part of the Soul is that which dissolves this Harmony and it is as the Idol Image Shadow and as the outcoat drawn from the surface of the Body the  Cabalists  call it  Nephes  it wanders about Sepulchers and is sometimes visible but to the eyes of those whom God Illuminates and this  Nephes  is that Fatal Hair in the Crown of Mens Heads Sacred to  Pluto  and  Proserpine  which before it be cut and drawn away from the Crown of the Head the Soul cannot be separate from the Body so also unless this  Nephes  be drawn as it were from the outmost surface of the Body a Man cannot leave this Life and this part of the Soul if we believe the Doctrine of the  Cabalists  is that which is called out by  Magicians  and  Necromancers Pluto  and  Proserpine  being first appeas'd which if they put on their former Bodies and such an Habit as they wore alive their Answers are called  Necromantical  if they appear'd only in flitting and subtile Shadows their answers were said to be  Scyomantical  So far  Boissardus  Whence I only Note that if there be such a shadowy and wandring part of the Soul as is here mentioned call'd  Nephes  its probable the Woman mentioned by  Diembroke  saw that at the death of Persons  As to my own experience relating to that of the  SecondSighted Persons  abovemention'd I shall here set it down in reference to two of the particulars above Written from Mr  Aubrey  's Account  viz  the Second and Fifth As in the second particular it's said that those that have the  Second Sight  see a multitude of Men and Women Day and Night about them So it was with my self for some time for I saw Hundreds tho' I never saw any in the Night time without a Fire or Candlelight or in the Moonshine and as the Person mention'd in that Paragraph had two particular Spirits there Named which constantly attended him besides others without Names so it was with my self two Spirits constantly attending me Night and Day for above Three Months together who call'd each other by their Names and several Spirits would often call at my Chamber Door and ask whether such Spirits lived there calling them by their Names and they would answer they did As for the other Spirits that attended me I heard none of their Names mentioned only I ask'd one Spirit which came for some Nights together and rung a little Bell in my Ear what his Name was who answer'd  Ariel  We find that one of the Spirits which attended the  Second Sighted Person  appeared as a Boy the other as a Girl but the two that constantly attended my self appear'd both in Womens Habit they being of a Brown Complexion and about Three Foot in Stature they had both black loose Network Gowns tyed with a black Sash about their Middles and within the Network appear'd a Gown of a Golden  Colour with somewhat of a Light striking thro' it their Heads were not drest with Topknots but they had white Linnen Caps on with Lace on them about three Fingers breadth and over it they had a Black loose Network Hood  As the foresaid  Second Sighted Person  sitting by the Fire with others in the Wintertime would see Spirits standing by and often seem angry and disturbed tho' nothing visible to others mov'd him so as I have been sitting by the Fire with others I have seen several Spirits and pointed to the places where they were telling the Company they were there And one Spirit whom I heard calling to me as he stood behind me on a sudden clapt his Finger to my Side which I sensibly perceived and started at it and as I saw one Spirit come in at the Door which I did not like I suddenly laid hold of a pair of Tonges and struck at him with all my force whereupon he Vanish'd  As in the Fifth Particular above Written He said that the Gift of the  Second Sight  is very troublesome to those that have it and they would gladly be rid of it So I must declare that I would not for the whole World undergo what I have undergone upon Spirits coming twice to me their first coming was most dreadful to me the thing being then altogether new and consequently more surprising tho' at the first coming they did not appear to me but only called to me at my Chamber Windows Rung Bells Sung to me and play'd on Musick  c  but the last coming also carried terrour enough for when they came being only Five in Number the  Two Women before mentioned and Three Men though afterwards there came Hundreds they told me they would kill me if I told any Person in the House of their being there which put me in some Consternation and I made a Servant sit up with me Four Nights in my Chamber before a Fire it being in the  Christmas  Holydays telling no Person of their being there One of these Spirits in Womans dress lay down upon my Bed by me every Night and told me if I Slept the Spirits would kill me which kept me waking for three Nights In the mean time a near Relation of Mine went tho' unknown to me to a Physician of my acquaintance desiring him to prescribe me somewhat for Sleeping which he did and a Sleeping Potion was brought me but I set it by being very desirous and inclined enough to Sleep without it The Fourth Night I could hardly forbear Sleeping but the Spirit lying on the Bed by me told me again I should be Kill'd if I Slept whereupon I rose and sat by the Fire side and in a while return'd to my Bed and so I did a Third time but was still threatned as before whereupon I grew impatient and ask'd the Spirits what they would have told them I had done the part of a Christian in humbling my self to God and fear'd them not and rose from my Bed took a Cane and knock'd at the Ceiling of my Chamber a near Relation of mine lying then over me who presently rose and came down to me about two of the Clock in the Morning to whom I said you have seen me disturbed these Four Days past and that I have not Slept the occasion of it was that  ive Spirits which are  now in the Room with me have threatned to kill me if I told any Person of their being here or if I Slept but I am not able to forbear Sleeping longer and acquaint you with it and now stand in defiance of them and thus I exerted my self about them and notwithstanding their continual Threats I Slept very well the next Night and continued so to do tho' they continued with me above Three Months Day and Night  A Gentleman having lately supply'd me with another Account concerning the  Second Sighted Persons  which was sent some Years since to a Lady by a Person of whom she had desired it I shall here set down the particulars of it as follows  I He says the more general Account given of the  Second Sighted Persons  is that many  Highlanders  but far more  Islanders  are qualified with this  Sight  That Men Women and Children are indifferently gifted with it some Children have it whose Parents have it not and some Parents have it whose Children have it not some adult Persons have it who had it not in their Youth and cannot tell by what means or cause it was produc'd in them It is a great trouble to those that have it and they would be rid of it at any rate The Sight is of no long duration continuing for the most part but as long as they can keep their Eyes steady without twinkling the most Assured therefore fix their look that they see the longer but the Timerous see only by glances their Eyes always trembling at the first sight of the object  II That which is seen generally by them is the species of Living Creatures and of Inamimate  things as Ships and the Habits upon Persons They never see the Species of any Person already Dead what they foresee fails not to exist in the mode and place where it appears to them they cannot well know what space of time shall intervene betwixt the Apparition and the real Existence but some of the boldest and longest experienced have some Rules of Conjectures As if they see a Man with a Shroud in the Apparition they will conjecture at the nearness or remoteness of his Death by the more or less of his Body that  cover'd with it They will ordinarily see their absent Friends tho' at a great distance sometimes no less than from  America  to  Scotland  sitting or standing or walking in some certain place and then they conclude with assurance that they shall see them so and there If a Man be in Love with a Woman they ordinarily see that Man standing by her and so if a Woman be in Love They conjecture of their enjoyments by the  Species  touching the Person or appearing at a distance from her If they see the  Species  of a Person who is Sick in any other place in an Healthful Pasture or Action they conclude a recovery but if they are to Dye they see them cover'd with a WindingSheet  These generals were verified to Persons of Honour by such of them as did See and were esteem'd Honest and Sober by all the Neighbourhood And because there were more of these Seers in the Isles of  Lewis Harris  and  Vist  than elsewere some Persons of Quality intreated Sir  James Macdonel  who is now dead Sir  Norman Maclod  and Mr  Daniel  Morison  a very honest Minister who are still alive to inquire into this  Sight  and to acquaint them therewith which they did and all of them found an agreement in these generals and Informed them of many particular and notorious Instances confirming what they said  He sets down some remarkable Instances which he says were of very knowing and ingenious Persons who had made it their business to be well informed concerning the  Second Sight  which Instances being not Printed in any other Author that I know of I shall insert them here  The First Instance he says is from a Person of great Learning and eminent Quality who gave the following Relation  I was once Travelling in the  Highlands  with many Servants one of them going a little before me and entring into a House where I was to stay all Night suddenly stept back with a screech and a noise and fell by a Stone which hit is Foot I askt what the matter was for he look'd as one very much Frighted he told me very seriously I must not Lodge in that House I ask'd why he said he wish'd so because a Dead Corps would very shortly be carried out of it and that several Persons carrying of it met him at the Door when I heard him cry and therefore he would not have me Lodge in so unlucky a place and seeing me Laugh and go in he said to the other Servants he was very sorry I did so for he was sure what he saw would very shortly come to pass this made me inquire if there were any sick Person in the House but there was none the  Landlord was a strong Healthy  Highlander  yet before I went from the House the next Day he Died of an Apoplectick Fit  The Second Instance is from another Person who writes thus  In the Year  Alexander Monro  who was afterwards Lieutenant Collonel to the Earl of  Dunbarton  's Regiment and my self were walking in a place called  Ulabill  in  Logh Broome  in a little Plain at the foot of a rugged Hill there was a Man working with a Spade in the walk before us and his Face to the Hill he did not mind us as we past near him which made me look at him and perceiving him to stare a little strangely I conjectured him to be a  Seer  I called him at which he stared and smiled what are you doing said I he answered me I have seen a very strange thing an Army of  Englishmen  leading their Horses down that Hill and a number of them are come down to the Plain and eating the Barley which is growing in the Field near to the Hill This was on the Fourth of  May  for I noted the Day and it was Four or Five Days before the Barly was Sown in the Field he spoke of  Alexander Monro  ask'd him how he knew they were  Englishmen  he said because they had on Hatts and Boots which he knew no  Scots  would have there we as little set by what he said as other foolish Visions but in the beginning of  August  following the Earl of  Middleton  then Lieutenant for the King in the  Highlands  having occasion to march a Party towards the South  Highlands  sent his Foot thro' a place called  Innerlawel  but was forced to send his Horse with  Alexander Monro  to pass down  the very forementioned Hill as less rugged tho' bad enough than that of  Innerlawel  and the formost Party which was first down the Hill fell to eating the Barly on the little Plain under it and  Monro  call'd to mind what the  Seer  had told us in  May  before he writ of it and sent an express to me with it  The Relator of the Third Instance writes as follows  I had once an occasion of being in Company with a Young Lady and was told there was a notable  Seer  in the Company I call'd him to speak with me as I did ordinarily when I found any of them and as he had answered me to several Questions I ask'd him if he knew any Person to be in Love with that Lady he said he certainly knew that there was a Man in Love with her but he did not know the Man for in the Two Days he had been in Company with her he perceived one standing near her and his Head leaning on her Shoulder which he said according to his Observations foretold that the Man would Marry her This was in the Year I desired him to describe the Person which he did so that I could conjecture by the description it was such an one of the Lady's Acquaintance tho' there were no thought of their Marriage till Two Years after and happening in the Year to find this  Seer  who was an  Islander  in Company with the other Person whom I conjectured to have been described by him I call'd him aside and ask'd him if that were the Person he saw by the Lady's side Two Years ago he said it was truly the same and he had seen that Lady just then standing by him  Hand in Hand This was some few Months before their Marriage and the Man is since Dead and the Lady still alive  The Fourth Instance is thus  In  January  says one of great Note Lieutenant Collonel  Monro  and my self hapned to be in the House of one  William Maclod  of  Ferrinlia  in  R  sse  the said  Monro  the Landlord and my self sitting in Three Chairs near the Fire and in the corner of a great Chimney were two  Islanders  who came that very Night to the House and were related to the Landlord while one of them was talking to  Monro  I perceived the other to look odly towards me from his Look and being an  Islander  I conjectured him a  Seer  and ask'd him what he star'd at he answered by desiring me to rise from that Chair because it was an unlucky one I ask'd him why he said there was a Dead Man in the Chair next to me well said I if he be in the Chair next me I may keep my own but what kind of Man is he he said he was a tall Man with a long grey Coat having Boots on and one of his Leggs hanging over the arm of the Chair and his Head hanging down to the other side and his Arm backward as if it were broken There were some Troops of  EnglishMen  then Quartered near that place and there being at that time a great Frost after a Thaw the Country was covered all over with Ice Four or Five of the  English  Riding by this House some Two Days after the Vision while we were sitting by the Fire we heard a great Noise which proved to be these Troopers who with the help of other Servants were carrying one of  their Number who had got a very mischievous fall and his Arm Broken and falling frequently into Swooning Fits they brought him into the Hall and set him in the very Chair and in the very Posture the  Seer  had described but the Man did not Die tho' he recovered with great difficulty  The Fifth Instance is taken from the Account given in by Sir  Norman Maclod    There was a Gentleman in the  Isle  of  Harris  who was always seen by the  Seers  with an Arrow in his Thigh Those in the  Isle  who thought these Prognostications Infallible did not doubt but he would be Shot in the Thigh and Die of it Sir  Norman  said he always heard it the Subject of their Discourses for many Years when that Gentleman was present at last he Died without any such Accident Sir  Norman  was at his Burial at St  Clement  's Church in the  Isle  of  Harris  At the same time another Gentleman was brought to be Buried in the same Church The Friends on either side came to a debate who should first enter the Church and from Words came to Blows one who was Arm'd with a Bow and Arrows let fly amongst them every Family in that  Isle  have their Burying Places in the Church in a Stone Chest and their Bodies are carried in open Biers to the Burial Place Sir  Norman  having appeased the Tumult One of the Arrows was found sticking in the Dead Man's Thigh To this Sir  Norman  himself was Witness Mr  Aubrey  in his Account of the  Second Sight  has a Relation much of the same with this▪ tho' with some variation  The Sixth Instance is taken from the Account which Mr  Daniel Morison  Minister in the  Isle  of  Lewis  gave in  This Relation tho' somewhat of a different Nature from the others may be worth Notice He tells us of a Young Woman in his Parish who was mightily Frighted by seeing her own Image still before her when she went into the open Air the Back of the Image being always towards her So that it was not a Reflection as in a Mirror but the Species of such a Body as her own and in the very same Habit the Minister kept her a long while with him but she had no Remedy till she was about Four or Five Years Elder and then it left her  The Gentleman who writ the foregoing Relations in a Letter to a Lady adds in the close of it that in order to solve the  Phaenomenon  of the  Second Sight  a hint may be taken from this Image which appeared to the Woman abovementioned and from such another mention'd by  Aristotle  in the Fourth Book of his  Metaphysicks  as also from that common Opinion that Young Infants see Apparitions which are not seen by Elder Eyes and likewise from this that several who have had the  Second Sight  when in the  Highlands  or  Isles  upon their being transported to Live in other Countries especially in  America  lose this quality as it's reported by Gentlemen who knew some of them in  Barbadoes  that saw no Visions there tho' they were known to have been  Seers  when they lived in the  Isles  of  Scotland    Laurentius Ananias  Printed a Book in  Latin  at  Venice An  concerning the nature of  Daemons    L    circa finem    where he writes somewhat which seems ally'd to this Gift of the  Second Sight  It is thus  Some  Daemons  so miserably delude some Old Women and Children that they certainly perswaded themselves that on set Nights and at set Hours their Souls being called depart from their Bodies and joyn themselves to the Souls of the Dead which proceeds but from  Daemons  corrupting the Imagination of those Creatures thro' Infidelity after that manner and as they relate this to credulous Old Women they Predict the Deaths of certain Persons and if the event sometimes answers they confidently affirm even upon their Oath that they were Souls from whom they had it when in truth they are nothing but Illusions of the Devil perverting their Fancy which error has possest the Minds of some Persons above the Vulgar though it hence appears they are all under a delusion for it hapned some Years since that in a Town where some Persons were found obnoxious to these affects and illusions of the Devil one  Mark Antony  who was look'd upon as an Honest Upright Person no way given to speak Untruths was seized with it and often gave true Predictions concerning certain Persons especially such as were near their Deaths this Man being sent for by my Brother  John Antony Ananias  who is a Priest and he coming to him my Brother ask'd him whether what was reported of him were true and he did not deny it whereupon my Brother advised him to quit that erronious Opinion  telling him that those could not possibly be the Souls of the Dead but that they were deceitful  Daemons  and that he greatly offended God in giving Credit to them wherefore he begg'd him that for Gods sake and the wellfare of his Soul as he perceived that  Daemonaical  seizure coming upon him as he always perceived it beforehand or when he began to be seized with it he would seriously protest against obeying them any longer and that he would earnestly Pray to God to Free him from that Diabolical Delusion and Madness of Mind  Mark Antony  being somewhat astonished at what was said to him believed my Brother and promised him to follow his Advice to the utmost of his Power and so went Home and when the usual Day came that he was obnoxious to those Illusions he was not seiz'd with them and was very Joyful and gave God thanks for it But upon the next return of the Day and Hour for he was not wont to be Infested with those Illusions every Day of the Week but only  Tuesdays  and  Thursdays  finding his wonted seizure coming upon him and that he was called by those unclean Spirits and being greatly afflicted in Mind by their Signs he cry'd out with great Vehemency that he would no longer follow them Upon which outcry almost all the People in the House were Awaken'd and went to him to whom he related all that had past and shew'd how he was severely Beaten by those Spirits and from that time he was wholly freed from them for which he gave God great Thanks  Note in Reference to this Relation what is written by  Henry Boguet  a Judge in Cases of Witchcraft in the Country of St  Claude  in  Burgundy  concerning the particular Nights on which Witches have their  Sabbaths  or meetings In his Discourse of Witches printed in  French  at  Lyons  Chap    he writes as follows  I formerly thought that the  Sabbath  was held only  Thursday  Nights because all the Witches I have seen have so declar'd but since that I have read that some of them have confess'd they assembled some the Night betwixt  Monday  and  Tuesday  some the Night betwixt  Friday  and  Saturday  others the Night preceeding  Thursday  or  Sunday  thence I have concluded that there is no Day prefixt for their  Sabbath  but that the Witches go to it when the Devil requires them I shall add here that  Antide Coles  a Witch confess'd she had been at the  Sabbath  each good Day of the Year as at  Christmas Easter  and the like Holidays So far  Boguet    Conformably to the Relation of  Laurentius Ananias  I have been well inform'd of a Woman in  Gloucestershire  who when any Person of the Neighbourhood was taken Ill would generally predict their Death or recovery and was much resorted to on that Account at length she was seized and had to an  Assizes  at  Gl  u  ster  concerning this Fact where being ask'd by the Judge how she came by her knowledge as to the Death or Recovery of Persons sick she told him she could give no other Account of it but that when any Person  was sick and she had a Mind to know the Issue a Jury of  Fairies  came to her in the Night time who consider'd of the Matter and if afterwards they look'd cheerful the Party would recover if they look'd sad he would die Nothing else being brought against the Woman she was clear'd The Person from whom I had this Information was a Justice of Peace of that County then on the Bench And here I must say that before I heard this Relation or had read  Ananias  I saw a Jury of  Fairies  or  Ghosts  or what you please to call them summon'd and pass a Verdict on a Person known to me  Cardan  tells us  De Rer var l    c    That  Genii  sometimes appear sad before the Deaths of Persons and gives an instance in  Julian  the Emperor who being near  Clesiphon  and studying Philosophy saw his  Genius  looking sad whom formerly he had seen in  France  looking cheerfully and I know not what Verses foretelling the Death of  Constantius  and consequently his Happiness and the Horn of  Amalthaea  with which the  Genius  of the Republick was wont to be drawn being shut and his Chamberlane or Steward of his House going from him and so the next Day the Emperor was kill'd  Baptista Fulgosus  tells us That sometimes the Spirits remain inclos'd in Humane Bodies  L    fact dict Memorah c    but their Motions are so occult and the Senses so bound that we cannot easily know whether those Bodies are alive or not Hence some are said to be rais'd from the dead who were never really dead experience having shewn they were still living of these Persons some relate wonderful things as that they had been where they never were but their Spirit  being collected in it self comprehends and sees those things which being in its usual State through various distracted Thoughts by reason of the Corporeal Sight it does not know As St  Austin  testifies of one  Curina  who liv'd in the Country of  Hippo  in  Africa  and falling into an ill Distemper was look'd upon by all Men as in a manner dead having lost his Senses so that he took no Food and having continued in this State for some Days his Friends would have buried him only they perceiv'd a little breathing at his Nostrils but when afterwards all Persons thought him to be departed on a sudden opening his Eyes he desir'd that some one should be presently sent to  Curina  the Blacksmith his Neighbour to see how he did and when it was found he was dead at that very hour he affirm'd that he was led before a certain Judge who vehemently chid those Spirits by whom himself was brought before him because he would have  Curina  the Blacksmith and not him and for that cause he was restor'd to Life In this Extasy he said he saw Paradise and many other things and among others that he was baptiz'd by St  Austin  at  Hippo  and he was admonish'd so to be because what then seem'd to be done was a Vision therefore being restor'd to his Health he had fulfil'd what he was admonish'd  So as  Bonaysteau  tells us The Spirit of  Hermotinus    In Disc de excel dig hominis  as it seem'd leaving his Body as dead wandred about various Places and afterwards related those things which could be known only by those Persons which were present to the things themselves  Herodotus  and  Maximus Tyrius  write the same of  Aristaeus    Possidonius  tells us That a certain  Rhodian  dying nominated six of his equals and said who should die first who next and so on and the Event answer'd the Prediction  A Vision which happen'd to the Ingenious and Learned Dr  Donne  may not improperly be here inserted Mr  Isaac Walton  writing the Life of the said  Doctor  tells us That the  Doctor  and his Wife living with Sir  Robert Drury  who gave them a free Entertainment at his House in  Drurylane  It happen'd that the  Lord Hay  was by  King James  sent in an Ambassy to the  French King Henry the Fourth  whom Sir  Robert  resolv'd to accompany and ingag'd Dr  Donne  to go with them whose Wife was then with Child at Sir  Robert  's  House  Two Days after their arrival at  Paris  Dr  Donne  was left alone in that Room in which Sir  Robert  and he and some other Friends had dined together To this place Sir  Robert  return'd within half an hour and as he left so he found Dr  Donne  alone but in such an Extasy and so alter'd in his Looks as amaz'd Sir  Robert  to behold him insomuch that he earnestly desir'd Dr  Donne  to declare what had befall'n him in the short time of his absence To which Dr  Donne  was not able to make a present Answer but after a long and perplext Pause did at last say I have seen a dreadful Vision since I saw you I have seen my Dear Wife pass twice by me through this Room with her Hair hanging about her Shoulders and a dead Child in her Arms this I have seen since I saw you To which Sir  Robert  reply'd sure Sir you have slept since I saw you and this is the result of some Melancholy Dream which I desire you to forget for you are now awake To which  Dr  Donne  's reply was I cannot be surer that I now live than that I have not slept since I saw you and am as sure at her second appearing she stopt and look'd me in the Face and vanish'd Rest and Sleep had not alter'd Dr  Donne  's Opinion the next Day for he then affirm'd this Vision with a more deliberate and so confirm'd a Confidence that he inclin'd Sir  Robert  to a faint belief that the Vision was true who immediately sent a Servant to  DruyHouse  with a Charge to hast'n back and bring him word whether Mrs  Donne  were alive and if alive in what Condition she was as to her Health the Twelfth Day the Messenger return'd with this Account That he found and left Mrs  Donne  very sad and sick in Bed and that after a long and dangerous Labour she had been deliver'd of a dead Child and upon Examination the Abortion prov'd to be the same Day and about the very hour that Dr  Donne  affirm'd he saw her pass by in his Chamber Mr  Walton  adds This is a Relation which will beget some wonder and well it may for most of our World are at present possess'd with an Opinion that Visions and Miracles are ceas'd and though 'tis most certain that two Lutes being both strung and tun'd to an equal pitch and then one play'd upon the other that is not touch'd being lay'd upon a Table at a fit Distance will like an  Eccho  to a Trumpet warble a faint audible Harmony in Answer to the same tune yet many will not believe that there is any such thing as a Sympathy with Souls  c  An Ancient and Learned Gentleman now living and well known in  London  has told me that being at a Widow Gentlewoman's House about seven Miles from  London  one Day about three of the Clock in the Afternoon he retir'd to his Chamber where he had not long been but a strange Light such as he had never seen before appear'd in the Room in which Light he saw a Child of the Gentlewoman of the House which had been left sick in  London  lye dead as also a Friend of his own he was much surpriz'd at this and after the thing was over he went down from his Chamber to the Gentlewoman of the House and as he had been desir'd to come tho' next Day to the House of a Lady who liv'd in the same Parish he desir'd the foresaid Gentlewoman to send word to the Lady that he could not wait on her the next Day as he had promis'd for he knew that both the said Gentlewoman and himself should be sent for to  London  and then he told the Gentlewoman what had pass'd and in a while a Coach came for them from  London  accordingly The same Gentleman told me that upon his falling into a Trance at  Cambridge  he saw also a Friend of his dead in  London  who upon enquiry was found to have died just at the time he saw him  Cardan  gives a Relation somewhat of this Nature as follows  De Rer var l    c    My Kinsman  Baptista Cardan  studying at  Pavia  on a certain Night tryed to make a little Fire as he rose and in the interim heard a Voice say farewel my Son I am going to  Rome  and he saw a vast Splendor as that of a bundle of Straw all on Fire being affrighted and throwing by the FireShovel  he hid himself under his Bedcloaths till his Schoolfellows return'd from the Academy upon their return thinking him to be sick they knock'd at his Door he open'd it and they asking him the cause of his stay there he answer'd he thought his Mother was dead and told them what he had seen and heard and wept withal They turn'd the thing to a Jest some laughing at him some comforting him the Day following having heard nothing of his Mother's sickness he was certifyed of her Death and that she expir'd at that very hour that he perceiv'd those things The Town  Cardan  is distant Two and Forty Miles from  Pavia  That Man was not given to Lyes vain or superstitious and who said he had never seen or heard any preternatural thing till then  A Book newly coming to my Hands which contains a more particular Account in some respects of the  Second sight  in  Scotland  than any I have met with I shall give here some Account of it  Mr  M Martin  Printed the last Year in  London  a Book in  o  intitl'd  A Description of the Western Isles of  Scotland  call'd by the ancient Geographers Hebrides  It contains many curious Particulars relating to the Natural and Civil History of those  Islands  with a Map of them and in his Preface he tells us that perhaps its peculiar to those  Isles  that they have never been describ'd till now by any Man that was a Native of the Country or had travell'd them as himself has done and in the Conclusion of the said Preface he tells us he has giv'n here such an Account of the  Second sight  as the Nature of the thing will bear and which has  always been reckon'd sufficient among the unbyass'd part of Mankind but for those that will not be so satisfyed they ought to oblige us with a new Scheme by which we may judge of Matters of Fact The chief particulars he has giv'n us concerning the  Second sight  are in a Chapter by it self as follows  I In the  Second sight  the Vision makes such a lively Impression on the  Seers  that they neither see nor think of any thing else but the Vision as long as it continues and then they appear pensive or jovial according to the Object which was presented to them  II At the sight of a Vision the Eyelids of the Person are erected and the Eyes continue staring till the Object vanish as has often been observ'd by the Author and others present  III There is one in  Skye  an Acquaintance of whom observ'd that when he sees a Vision the inner part of his Eyelids turns so far upwards that after the Object disappears he must draw them down with his Fingers and sometimes employs others to draw them down which he finds to be much the easier way  IV The faculty of the  Second sight  does not lineally descend in a Family as some imagine for he knows several Parents that are endow'd with it but not their Children and so on the contrary neither is it acquir'd by any previous compact and after a strict enquiry he could never learn from any among them that this faculty was communicable any way whatsoever  Note  That this Account is differing from the Account giv'n before from Mr  Aubrey  And I think Mr  Martin  's reason here against the descent of this faculty from Parents to  Children is not generally conclusive for tho' he may know Parents endow'd with it and not Children and so on the contrary yet there may be Parents who are endow'd with it being qualifyed as Mr  Aubrey  has said  viz  both being  Second sighted  whose Children may have it by descent And as to this faculty's being any other ways communicable since the Accounts differ I must leave it to a farther Examination  V The Seer knows neither the object time nor place of a Vision before it appears and the same Object is often seen by different Persons living at a considerable distance from one another The true way of judging as to the time and circumstance of an Object is by Observation for several Persons of Judgment without this faculty are more capable to judge of the design of a Vision than a Novice that is a  Seer  As an Object appears in the Day or Night it will come to pass sooner or later accordingly  VI If an Object be seen early in the Morning which is not frequent it will be accomplish'd in a few Hours afterwards If at Noon it will commonly be accomplish'd that very Day If in the Evening perhaps that Night if after Candles be lighted it will be accomplish'd that Night it's later always in accomplishment by Weeks Months and sometimes Years according to the time of the Night the Vision is seen  VII When a Shroud is perceiv'd about one it's a sure Prognostick of Death the time is judg'd according to the height of it about the Person for if it be not seen above the middle Death is not to be expected for the space  of a Year and perhaps some Months longer and as it is frequently seen to ascend higher towards the Head Death is concluded to be at Hand within a few Days if not Hours as daily Experience confirms Examples of this kind were shown the Author when the Persons of whom the Observations were made enjoy'd perfect Health  There was one instance lately of a Prediction in this kind by a  Seer  that was a Novice concerning the Death of one of the Author's Acquaintance this was communicated to a few only and with great Confidence the Author being one of the Number did not in the least regard it till the Death of the Person about the time foretold confirm'd to him the certainty of the Prediction the foresaid Novice is now a skilful  Seer  as appears from many late instances he lives in the Parish of St  Mary's  the most Northern in  Skye    VIII If a Woman be seen standing at a Man's left Hand it's a presage that she will be his Wife whether they are Marryed to others or Unmarryed at the time of the Apparition If two or three Women are seen at once standing near a Man's left Hand she that is next him will undoubtedly be his Wife first and so on whether all three or the Man be single or Marryed at the time of the Vision or not of which there are several late instances of the Author's Acquaintance It's an ordinary thing for them to see a Man that is to come to the House shortly after and if he be not of the  Seer  's Acquaintance yet he gives such a lively Description of his Stature Complexion Habit  c  that upon his Arrival he Answers the Character giv'n of him in  all respects If the Person so appearing be one of the  Seer  's Acquaintance he can tell by his Countenance whether he comes in good or bad Humour The Author has been seen thus by  Seers  of both Sexes at some Hundreds of Miles distance Some that saw him in this manner had never seen him Personally and it happen'd according to their Visions without any previous Design of his to go to those places his coming there being purely Accidental And in the  th  Page of his Book he tells us that Mr  Daniel Morison  a Minister told him that upon his Landing in the  Island Rona  the Natives receiv'd him very affectionately and Address'd themselves to him with this Salutation God save you Pilgrim you are heartily welcome here for we have had repeated Apparitions of your Person among us  viz  after the manner of the  Second Sight    IX It's ordinary with them to see Houses Gardens and Trees in places void of all three and this in Process of time uses to be accomplish'd of which he gives an instance in the  Island  of  Skye    X To see a spark of Fire fall upon ones Arm or Breast is a forerunner of a dead Child to be seen in the Arms of those Persons of which there are several fresh Instances  To see a Seat empty at the time of ones sitting in it is a presage of that Persons Death quickly after  When a Novice or one that has lately obtain'd the  Second sight  sees a Vision in the Night time without Doors and comes near a Fire he presently falls into a Swoon  Some find themselves as it were in a crowd of People having a  Corps  which they carry a long with them and after such Visions the  Seers  come in sweating and describe the People that appear'd if there are any of their Acquaintance among them they give an Account of their Names and also of the Bearers but they know nothing concerning the  Corps    All those that have the  Second sight  do not always see these Visions at once though they are together at the time but if one who has this faculty designedly touch his Fellow  Seer  at the instant of a Visions appearing then the second sees it as well as the first  XI There is a way of foretelling Death by a  Cry  that they call  Taisk  which some call a  Wrath  in the Lowland They hear a loud Cry without Doors exactly resembling the Voice of some particular Person whose Death is foretold by it of which he gives a late instance which happen'd in the Village  Rigg  in  Skye Isle    XII Things are also foretold by  Smelling  sometimes as follows Fish or Flesh is frequently smelt in the Fire when at the same time neither of the two are in the House or in any probability like to be had in it for some Weeks or Months This smell several Persons have who are endued with the  Second sight  and its always accomplish'd soon after  XIII  Children Horses  and  Cows  have the  Second sight  as well as Men and Women advanc'd in Years  That  Children  see it is plain from their crying aloud at the very instant that a  Corps  or any other Vision appears to an ordinary  Seer  Of  which he gives an instance in a Child when himself was present  That  Horses  see it's likewise plain from their violent and sudden starting when the Rider or  Seer  in Company with them sees a Vision of any kind Night or Day it's observable of an Horse that he will not go forward that way till he be led about at some distance from the common Road and then he is in a sweat he gives an instance of this in an Horse in the  Isle  of  Skye    That  Cows  have the  Second sight  appears from this that if a Woman Milking a Cow happens to see a Vision by the  Second sight  the Cow runs away in a great fright at the same time and will not be pacifyed for some time after  In reference to this  Paracelsus Tom    l de Arte praesagâ  writes thus Horses also have their Auguries who perceive by the sight and smell wandring Spiris Witches and Spectres and the like things and Dogs both see and hear the same things  Here in the next place the Author answers Objections that have lately been made against the reality of the  Second sight    First  It's objected that these  Seers  are Visionary and Melancholy People who fancy they see things that do not appear to them or any Body else  He Answers The People of these  Isles  and particularly the  Seers  are very Temperate and their Diet is Simple and Moderate in Quantity and Quality so that their Brains are not in all Probability disorder'd by Undigested fumes of Meat or Drink Both Sexes are free from Hysterick Fits Convulsions and several  other Distempers of that sort There are no Madmen among them nor any instance of self Murther It's observ'd among them that a Man drunk never has a Vision of the  Second sight  And he that is a Visionary would discover himself in other things as well as in that nor are such as have the  Second sight  judg'd to be Visionaries by any of their Friends or Acquaintance  Secondly  It's objected That there are none among the Learned able to oblige the World with a satisfactory Account of these Visions therefore they are not to be believ'd  He Answers If every thing for which the Learned are not able to give a Satisfactory account shall be condemn'd as False and Impossible we shall find many other things generally believ'd which must be rejected as such  Thirdly  It's objected That the  Seers  are Impostors and the People who believe them are Credulous and easily impos'd upon  He Answers The  Seers  are generally Illiterate and well meaning People and altogether void of Design nor could he ever learn that any of them made the least gain of it neither is it reputable among them to have that faculty beside the People of the  Isles  are not so Credulous as to believe an Impossibility before the thing foretold be accomplish'd but when it actually comes to pass afterwards it is not in their Power to deny it without offering Violence to their Senses and Reason beside if the  Seers  were Deceivers can it be reasonable to imagine that all the  Islanders  who have not the  Second sight  should combine together and offer Violence to their Understandings  and Senses to force themselvs to believe a Lye from Age to Age There are several Persons among them whose Birth and Education raise them above the suspicion of concurring with an Imposter merely to gratify an illiterate and contemptible sort of Persons Nor can a reasonable Man believe that Children Horses and Cows could be ingaged in a combination to perswade the World of the reality of the  Second Sight    Every Vision that is seen comes exactly to pass according to the Rules of Observation tho' Novices and heedless Persons do not always judge by those Rules concerning which he gives Instances  There are Visions seen by several Persons in whose days they are not accomplished and this is one of the reasons why some things have been seen that are said never to have come to pass and there are also several Visions seen which are not understood till they are accomplish'd  The  Second Sight  is not a late discovery seen by one or two in a Corner or a remote  Isle  but its seen by many Persons of both Sexes in several  Isles  separated about Forty or Fifty Leagues from one another the Inhabitants of many of these  Isles  never had the least Converse by Word or Writing and this faculty of Seeing Visions having continued as we are informed by Tradition ever since the Plantation of these  Isles  without being disprov'd by the Nicest Sceptick after the strictest Enquiry seems to be a clear proof of its Reality  It's observable that it was much more common Twenty Years ago than at present for One in Ten does not see it now that saw it then  The  Second Sight  is not confin'd to the  Western Isles  alone the Author having an Account that its likewise in several parts of  Holland  but particularly in  Bommel  where a Woman has it for which she is courted by some and dreaded by others She sees a Smoak about ones Face which is a forerunner of the Death of a Person so seen and she actually foretold the Deaths of several that lived there she was living in that Town this last Winter  The  Second Sight  is likewise in the  Isle of Man  as appears by this Instance Captain  Leaths  the chief Commander of  Belfast  in his Voyage lost Thirteen Men by a violent Storm and upon his Landing in the  Isle of Man  an Ancient Man Clerk to a Parish there told him immediately that he had lost Thirteen Men the Captain enquired how he came to the knowledge of that he answered that it was by  Thirteen Lights  which he had seen come into the Churchyard as Mr  Sacheverel  tells us in his late description of the  Isle of Man  Note That this is like the sight of the  CorpsCandles  in  Wales  which is also well attested  Here the Author adds many other Instances concerning the  Second Sight  of which I shall set down only a few  A Man in  Knockow  in the Parish of St  Mary  's the Northermost part of  Skye  being in perfect Health and sitting with his fellow Servants at Night was on a sudden taken Ill dropt  from his Seat backward and then fell a Vomiting at which the Family was much concern'd he having never been subject to the like before but he came to himself soon after and had no sort of Pain about him One of the Family who was accustom'd to see the  Second Sight  told them that the Man's Illness proceeded from a very strange cause which was thus An illnatured Woman whom he named who lives in the next adjacent Village of  Bornskittag  came before him in a very furious and angry manner her Countenance full of Passion and her Mouth full of Reproaches and threatned him with her Head and Hands till he fell over as you have seen him This Woman had a Fancy for the Man but was like to be disappointed as to her Marrying of him This Instance was told the Author by the Master of the Family and others who were present when it happened  Sir  Norman Macklead  and some others Playing at Tables at a Game call'd in  Irish Falmermore  wherein there are Three of a Side and each of them throw the Dice by turns there happened to be one difficult Point in the disposing of one of the Tablemen this obliged the Gamester to deliberate before he was to change his Man since upon the disposing of it the Winning or Losing of the Game depended at length the Butler who stood behind advised the Player where to place his Man with which he comply'd and won the Game This being thought extraordinary and Sir  Norman  hearing one Whisper him in the Ear ask'd who advised him so skilfully he answer'd it was the Butler but this seem'd more strange for he could not Play at Tables  Upon this Sir  Norman  ask'd him how long it was since he had learnt to Play and the Fellow own'd that he had never Play'd in his Life but that he saw the Spirit  Brownie  a Spirit usually seen in that Country reaching his Arm over the Players Head and touching the part with his Finger on the Point where the Tableman was to be plac'd This was told the Author by Sir  Norman  and others who happen'd to be present at the time  Daniel Bow  alias  Black  an Inhabitant of  Bornskittag  who is one of the precisest  Seers  in the  Isles  foretold the death of a young Woman in  Minginis  within less than Hours before the time and accordingly she Died suddenly in the Fields tho' at the time of the Prediction she was in perfect Health but the Shroud appearing close about her Head was the ground of his Confidence that her Death was at hand  The same Person foretold the Death of a Child in his Master's Arms by seeing a spark of Fire fall on his Left Arm and this was likewise accomplish'd soon after the Prediction  Some of the Inhabitants of  Harries  Sailing round the  Isle  of  Sky  with a design to go to the opposite Mainland were strangely surprised with an Apparition of Two Men Hanging down by the Ropes that secured the Mast but could not conjecture what it meant they pursued their Voyage but the Wind turning contrary they were forced into  Broadford  in the  Isle  of  Skye  where they found Sir  Donald Mac Donald  keeping a Sheriffs Court and Two Criminals receiving Sentence of Death there the Ropes and Mast of that  very Boat were made use of to Hang those Criminals This was told the Author by several who had this Instance related them by the Boat's Crew  Several Persons living in a certain Family told the Author that they had frequently seen two Men standing at a Gentlewoman's Left Hand who was their Master's Daughter they told the Mens Names and being her equals it was not doubted but she would be Marry'd to one of them and perhaps to the other after the Death of the First Sometime after a Third Man appeared who seemed always to stand nearest to her of the Three but the  Seers  did not know him tho' they could describe him exactly and within some Months after this Man who was seen last actually came to the House and fully answer'd the description given of him by those who never saw him but in a Vision and he Marry'd the Woman shortly after they live in the  Isle  of  Skye  and both themselves and others confirm'd the truth of this Instance when the Author saw them  Archibald Mac Donald  of the Parish of St  Mary  's in the  Isle  of  Skye  being reputed famous for his Skill in foretelling things to come by the  Second Sight  hapning to be in the Village  Knockow  one Night and before Supper told the Family that he had just then seen the strangest thing he ever saw in his Life  viz  a Man with an ugly long Cap always shaking his Head but that the strangest of all was a little kind of an Harp which he had with Four Strings only and that it had Two Hart's Horns fixt in the front of it all that heard this odd Vision sell a  Laughing at  Archibald  telling him that he was Dreaming or had not his Wits about him since he pretended to see a thing which had no being and was not so much as heard of in any part of the World All this could not alter  Archibald  's Opinion who told them that they must excuse him if he Laught at them after the accomplishment of the Vision  Archibald  returned to his own House and within Three or Four Days after a Man with a Cap Harp  c  came to the House and the Harp Strings Horns and Cap answer'd the description of them at first view and he shook his Head when he play'd for he had Two Bells fixed to his Cap This Harper was a Poor Man who made himself a Buffoon for his Bread and was never seen before in those parts and at the time of the Prediction he was in the  Isle  of  Barray  which is about Twenty Leagues distant from that part of  Skye  This Relation is Vouch'd by Mr  Daniel Martin  and all his Family and such as were then present and live in the Village where this happened  One  Daniel Nicholson  Minister of St  Mary  's in  Skye  the Parish in which Mr  Archibald Mac Donald  liv'd told the Author that one  Sunday  after Sermon at the Chappel  Uge  he took an occasion to inquire of  Archibald  if he still retained that unhappy Faculty of Seeing the  Second Sight  and wish'd him to get rid of it if possible for said he it's no true Character of a Good Man  Archibald  was highly displeased and answered that he hop'd h  was no more unhappy than his Neighbours for seeing what they could not perceive I had said he as serious T  oughts as  my Neighbours in time of hearing a Sermon to Day and even then I saw a Corps lay'd on the Ground close to the Pulpit and I assure you it will be accomplish'd shortly for it was in the Day time There were none in the Parish then Sick and few are buried at that little Chappel nay sometimes not one in a Year Yet when Mr  Nicholson  return'd to Preach in the said Chappel a Fortnight or Three Weeks after he found one buried in the very Spot named by  Archibald  This Story is Vouch'd by Mr  Nicholson  and several of the Parishioners still living  Note  That it's an Argument of somewhat Evil attending this faculty of the  Second Sight  because there are Instances given of some Persons who have been freed of it upon using some Christian Practices  Sir  Norman Mac Lead  who has his Residence in the  Isle  of  Bernera  which lies between the  Isles  of  N Vist  and  Harries  went to the  Isle  of  Skye  about Business without appointing any time for his return his Servants in his absence being all together in the large Hall at Night one of them who had the  Second Sight  told the rest they must remove for there would be abundance of other Company in the Hall that Night one of his FellowServants answered that there was very little likelyhood of that because of the Darkness of the Night and the danger of coming thro' the Rocks that lie round the  Isle  but within an Hour after one of Sir  Norman  's Men came to the House bidding them provide Lights  c  for his Master had newly Landed  Sir  Norman  being told of this call'd for the  Seer  and examined him about it he answer'd that he had seen the Spirit  Brownie  in humane shape come several times and make a shew of carrying an Old Woman that sate by the Fire to the Door and at last seem'd to carry her out by Neck and Heels which made him Laugh heartily and gave occasion to the rest to conclude him Mad to Laugh so much without any reason This Instance was told the Author by Sir  Norman  himself  Four Men from the  Isle  of  Skye  and  Harries  went to  Barbadoes  and stay'd there some Years who tho' they had wont to see the  Second Sight  in their Native Countrey never saw it in  Barbadoes  but upon their return to  England  the First Night after their Landing they saw the  Second Sight  as the Author was told by several of their Acquaintance  John Morison  who lives in  Bernera  of  Harries  wears the Plant called  Fuga Daemonum  Sewed in the Neck of his Coat to prevent his seeing of Visions and says he never saw any since he first carry'd that Plant about him  A Spirit by the Country People call'd  Brownie  was frequently seen in all the most considerable Families in the  Isles  and  North  of  Scotland  in the shape of a tall Man having very long brown Hair but within these Years past he has been seen but rarely  There were Spirits also that appeared in the shape of Women Horses Swine Cats and some like Fiery Balls which would follow Men in the Fields but there have been  but few Instances of these for Years past  These Spirits us'd also to form sounds in the Air resembling those of an Harp Pipes the crowing of a Cock and of the grinding of Hand Mills and sometimes Voices have been heard in the Air at Night Singing  Irish  Songs the words of which Songs some of the Author's Acquaintance still retain one of them resembled the Voice of a Woman who died some time before and the Song related to her State in the other World These Accounts the Author says he had from Persons of as great Integrity as any are in the World So far Mr  Martin    As for Sounds in the Air resembling that of Musical Instruments crowings of a Cock Singing  c  I have often heard them my self  In my reading I have met with many well attested Instances which may strongly induce a belief of what is said concerning the  Second sight  Of which Instances I shall here give a few  Sicillus  an Herald to  Alphonsus  King of  Aragon  in his Book entitl'd  Le Blason des Couleurs  writes thus There is a Town in  Italy  call'd  Teridon  where this Miracle is wont to happen if any Citizen or Labourer be to die that Year when he labours his Field there clearly appears a great effusion of Blood and the Blood signifies a near ensuing Death of the Possessor of that Field  The Lord  Henry Howard  in the Book he writ against  Suppos'd Prophesies    Chap      writes thus  It chanc'd after the Decease of a certain honest  Gent  whom I forbear to Name in some Respects the Devil appearing  so he Expresses it  first to one of his Daughters in his wonted  shape and with a Voice and Countenance answerable and so again to another he brought the Young Woman into so strange a Condition that it would have griev'd any Man to have seen them and this seem'd strange withal that at the time his Appearance haunted them they could as well tell who came into the House what they said and did  c  as any that were present in their Companies The like Story for all the World is written of  Hieronymo  an  Italian  and likewise of one of the  Greek  Emperors So far the Lord  Howard  who I think may be look'd upon as an unexceptionable Testimony in the Story he relates of his own Knowledge he having otherwise little Faith in things of this kind  The Learned  Camerarius  writes thus  Hor sub cis cent    c    I could easily Name and shew a Man living in my Neighbourhood while I write this who formerly having been Famous for his Mannagement of Serious Affairs as well as other ways has now for many Years been kept under a Guard because now and then for certain intervals of time he is acted by a wonderful and troublesome Spirit for he does not only when in a sedate Mind call many that come to him though Strangers and such as he had never seen before by their proper Names and talk to them Pleasantly concerning their Parents Relations and the Coats of Arms of their Families and this as Familiarly as tho' he had been a long time Conversant with them and which he did to my self and if he be in a troubl'd State mixes False and Obscene things with what he says but also sometimes he speaks and does other unusual and strange things particularly it was observ'd  that some Years since about that very time that  Cispar Castalion  Admiral of  France  with his Son in Law and many Noblemen of his Religion were by surprize kill'd in their Beds at  Paris  he had wonderful Visions from which it might have been gather'd that some cruel Enterprize was somewhere contriv'd and executed Among other things the very Night of that cruel Butchery made at  Paris  he often cry'd out all is in Blood and a little after see see what great Troops of Devils do I see wandring in the Air on every side coming from several remote Parts Congratulating each other and skipping for Joy as tho' they had executed some strange and cruel Enterprize long desir'd by them but he added crying out that all those things were acted out of  Germany    I think this a great instance from a Learned Man and if any Men can satisfie themselves with  Aristotle  to solve Facts of this Nature by saying they are Operations of Melancholy I leave them to their Fancies If this Fact and others set down before by me may be receiv'd as a Truth I see not what difficulty there may be in admitting for a Truth what is reported of  Apollonius Tyanaeus  viz that as he was disputing in an open Auditory at  Ephesus  he cry'd out on a sudden that he saw  Domitian  stab'd at  Rome  at the very time that it was done  To give one instance nearer home There liv'd not many Years since a very aged Gentlewoman in  London  in  WaterLane  by  FleetStreet  whose Name was  Pight  who was endow'd with a Prophetick Spirit she was very well known to many Persons of my Acquaintance  now living in  London  Among others a Gentleman whose Candor I can no way suspect has told me that he often resorted to her as to an Oracle and that as soon as he came into her Presence she would usually tell him that she knew he was coming for that she had seen his Spirit for some time before And without his saying any thing to her she would commonly tell him what the Business was which he came to consult her about and what the Event of it would be Which he always found to fall out as she said and many other Persons now living can testifie the like Experience of her as to themselves  Joan Marcus Marci    Part    p      in his  Philos vet Restituta  tell us of a Boy seiz'd with the Plague at  Rome  who being thought dead on a sudden came to himself and calling his Master told him he had really been in Heaven and there had understood how many and who were to die out the House and naming them he affirm'd his Mastar should survive and to create a belief of what he said he shew'd that he had learn'd all Languages and presently thereupon spake in  Greek  with his Master he made a Tryal also in other Tongues by conversing with those who were skill'd in them whereas before he had only learn'd the  Roman  Language and when he had liv'd thus three Days falling into a Rage he lay'd hold of his Hands with his Teeth and really died and the others whom he had nam'd died his Master remaining alive  To the foregoing Account of the  Second Sighted Persons  in  Scotland  I shall subjoin a thing no less strange  viz  An Account of the  Spec  r  sighted Persons  in  NewEngland  so call'd because upon their being seiz'd with strange Fits as of Weeping Laughing Roaring Convulsions  violent Agitations  c  they were wont to see the  Spectres  of those Persons who they said tormented them  Mr  Cotton Mather  a Minister of  NewEngland  in his Relation of the  Wonders of the invisible World  inserted in his  Ecclesiastic  l History  of that Country Printed in  London An  in  fol  has giv'n us several Instances of this kind as also of many other Diabolical Operations And Mr  Robert Calef  a Merchent of  Boston  in  NewEngland  has giv'n us a pretty full Account of the same in his Book intitl'd  More wonders of the invisible World  or  The wonders of the invisible World display'd  in five Parts Printed in  London An  in  o  And whereas these two Authors seem to differ in Opinion the former thinking things to have been real and proceeding from the Operations of Evil Spirits and the later looking upon them g  nerally to have been Illusion and Imposture I shall give here an Abstract of both for Men to see what they may Rationally judge in the Matter  Mr  Mather  in the sixth Book of the said History  Chap    relates many of these Facts and that with all sincerity as he declares and says that no Rational Man of all that Country ever question'd them  His First Instance is of one  Anne Cole  a Person of serious Piety as he writes living in the House of her Godly Father at  Hartford  in  NewEngland  who  An  was taken with strange  its so that she would express strange things unknown to her self her Tongue being guided by a  Daemon  The general purport of her Discourse was that such and such Persons whom she nam'd were cons  ting how they might carry on Mischievous Designs against her and several others  by afflicting their Bodies or destroying their good Names One of the Persons mention'd by her was named  Greensmith  who was then in Prison on suspicion of Witchcraft and was brought before the Magistrates to whom the Ministers who had taken Notes of what  Anne Cole  had said reading what they had written she with Astonishment confess'd that the things were so and that her self with other Persons nam'd in the Paper had Familiarity with the Devil who told her that at  Christmas  they would have a Merry meeting when the Agreement betwixt them should be subscrib'd she declar'd that her Devil appear'd to her first in the shape of a Deer skipping about her and at length in that shape talk'd to her and that the Devil had frequently Carnal Knowledge of her On this Confession with other concurring Evidences the Woman was executed and other Persons accus'd made their escape whereupon  Anne Cole  was deliver'd of her extraordinary Vexations  The Second Instance is  Elizabeth Knap  who in  October  was taken after a very strange manner Weeping Laughing Roaring with violent Agitations  c  and had a  Daemon  speaking in her among other things she cry'd out in her Fits that a certain Woman in the Neighbourhood appear'd unto her and was the only cause of her Affliction the Woman thus cry'd out on was a very Vertuous Person who by the Advice of her Friends visited the afflicted who though she were in her  its and had her Eyes wholly shut yet when the innocent Woman was coming in she shew'd her self wonderful sensible of it and was in great Agonies at her approach but the innocent  Woman pray'd earnestly with and for this possess'd Creature whereupon as she came to her self she confess'd she had been deluded by Satan who in the shape of divers Persons cruelly tormented her after divers Manners and then told her it was not himself but they were her Tormentors  The Third Instance is of the House of Mr  William Morse  of  Newbury  which  An  was infested with  Daemons  not unlike the  Daemon of Tedworth  Bricks Sticks Stones Pieces of Wood  c  were often thrown at the House a long Staff danc'd up and down the Chimny and afterward was hung on a Line and swung to and fro an Iron Crook was violently hurryed about by an invisible hand and a Chair flew about the Room till at last it light on the Table where Meat stood ready to be Eaten and was like to have spoil'd all A Chest was by an invisible Hand carry'd from one place to another and the Doors Barricado'd and the Keys of the Family taken some of them from the Bunch where they were tyed and the rest flying about with aloud Noise of their Knocking against one another and many other unaccountable things of this kind pass'd too long for me here to set down a little Boy belonging to the Family was a Principal Sufferer in these Molestations he was flung about at such a rate that they fear'd his Brains would have been beaten out nor did they find it possible to hold him his Bed Clothes were pull'd off from his Bed his Bed shaken a Man took him to keep him in a Chair but the Chair fell a dancing and both were very near being thrown into the Fire he was prick'd on the Back they found an Iron  Spindle and Pins stuck in him all the Knives in the House were one after another stuck in his Back which the Spectators pull'd out Sometimes he bark'd like a Dog then clock'd like an Hen he complain'd that a Man call'd Pl appear'd to him as the cause of all Before the Devil put an end to these Tricks the invisible Hand which did all these things put on an astonishing visibility They often thought they felt the Hand that scratch'd them while yet they saw it not but when they thought they had hold of it it would give them the slip Once the Fist beating the Man was discernable but they could not catch hold of it at length an Apparition of a Blackamoor Child shew'd it self plainly to them another time a Drumming on the Board was heard which was followed with a Voice that sang  Revenge Revenge Sweet is Revenge  at this the People being terrifyed call'd upon God whereupon there follow'd a Mournful Voice uttering these Expressions Alas Alas we knock no more we knock no more and there was an end of all  The Fourth Instance is of the House of  Nicolas Desborough  at  Hartford  which  An  was troubl'd much after the same manner it began upon a Controversie happening betwixt the Man of the House and another Person concerning a Chest of Cloaths which the Man apprehended the other unjustly detain'd from him and it lasted divers Months till upon restoring the Cloaths the trouble ceas'd He adds at  Brighling  in  Sussex  in  England  there happen'd a Tragedy not unlike to this  An  It's Recorded by  Clarke  in the Second Volume of his Examples  His Fifth and Sixth Instances are Relations of the same Nature  His Seventh Instance is of one Mr  Philip Smith  aged about Fifty Years a Deacon of the Church of  Hadley  a Member of the general Court a Justice of the County Court a Lieutenant of a Troop and a Man very Exemplary for Devotion Sanctity and Gravity who  An  was miserably Murther'd by Witchcraft he was by his Office concern'd about relieving the Indigences of a wretched Woman in the Town who being dissatisfy'd with him express'd her self in a threatning manner so that he apprehended receiving mischief at her Hands he fell ill of a wearing Distemper and at length became delirious and cry'd out not only of Pains but also of Pins tormenting him in several Parts of his Body In his Affliction he exclaim'd much on the said Woman and others as being seen by him in the Room Some young Men in the Town went and gave disturbance to the Woman so complain'd of and all the while they were disturbing her he was at ease and slept as a weary Man Gallipots of Medicines prepar'd for him were unaccountably emptyed audible screechings were made about the Bed when his Hands and Feet lay wholly still and were held by others Mr  Smith  at length dies the Jury that view'd his Corps found a swelling on one Breast his Privities wounded or burnt his Back full of Bruises and several Holes that seem'd made with Awles divers Noises were heard in the Room where the Corps lay as the clattering of Chairs and Stools whereof no account could be giv'n  His Ninth Instance to the Facts of which the Author was himself a Witness is of Four Children of  John Goodwin  of  Boston  all Religiously educated These Children  An  were wrought on by Witchcraft by an Old Woman whom the Eldest Daughter who was about Thirteen Years of Age had provok'd so that she was immediately seiz'd with odd Fits in a short time after one of her Sisters and two Brothers were horribly seiz'd with the same all the Children were tormented still just in the same part of the Bodies at the same time tho' their Pains flew like Lightning from one part to another and they were kept so far asunder that they neither saw nor heard one anothers Complaints at Nine or Ten of the Clock at Night they still had a release from their Miseries and Slept all Night pretty well but when the Day came they were again miserably handl'd sometimes they were Deaf sometimes Dumb sometimes Blind and often all Three at once and many other unaccountable Symptoms attended them they made most pitious outcries that they were cut with Knives and struck with Blows and the plain prints of the Wounds were seen upon them the suspected Woman's House being search'd several Images or Puppets or Babies made of Rags and stuft with Goats Hair were there found and the Woman confest that the way to Torment the Objects of her Malice was by wetting of her Finger with her Spittle and stroaking those little Images The abused Children were then present in the Court and one of the Images being brought to the Woman she started up and snatch'd it into  her Hand when presently upon it one of the Children fell into sad Fits before the whole Assembly The Judges caused a repetition of the Experiment and still found the same effect of it tho' the Children saw not when the Hand of the Witch was laid upon the Images To make all things clear the Court appointed Five or Six Physicians to Examine her very strictly whether she were no way craz'd in her Understanding who after spending several Hours with her return'd her  Compos Mentis  and Sentence of Death was pass'd on her After her Condemnation Mr  Mather  says he visited her several times and she then told him she us'd to be at Meetings where her Prince and four more were present she told him who the four were and plainly said that her Prince was the Devil at her Execution she said the afflicted Children should not be reliev'd by her Death for others besides her self had a Hand in their Affliction And accordingly the Children continued afflicted far worse than before one of the Children discern'd the  Spectres  and told the Names of those that tormented them a blow struck at the place where he saw the  Spectre  was always felt by the Boy himself in that part of his Body which answer'd to that was struck at and this though his Back were turn'd and the thing so done that there could be no Collusion in it yet after the Agonies were over to which a push or a stab at the  Spectre  had put him to as in a Minute or two they would be he would have a respite from his Ails a considerable while and the  Spectre  would be gone The Affliction of the Children went on till they bark'd at each other like Dogs and then pur'rd like Cats They would  complain they were in a Red hot Oven and sweated and panted as if they had been really so Then they would say that cold Water was thrown on them at which they would shiver very much They would complain of being roasted on an invisible Spit and lie and roll and groan as if it had been so and by and by screech out that Knives were cutting them They would complain that their Heads were nail'd to the Floor and it was beyond an ordinary strength to pull them from thence Mr  Mather  says the  Daemons  did not know our Thoughts for if himself or others us'd a  Jargon  and said untie its Neckcloth but the Party bidden understood their meaning to be untie his Shooe the Neckcloth and not the Shooe has been by wrythen Postures rendred strangely unaccessible no good thing could then be endur'd near those Children who while they were themselves lov'd every good thing The eldest Girl being at Mr  Mather  's House a Chain invisible to any but her self would be clap'd about her and she in much pain and fear would cry out when they began to put it on sometimes Persons present could with their Hands knock it off as it began to be fastn'd but ordinarily when it was on she would be pull'd out of her Seat with much violence towards the Fire that it was as much as one or to two could do to keep her out if Persons present stamp'd on the Hearth just between her and the Fire she scream'd out that by jarring the Chain they hurt her An unseen Rope with a cruel Noose was put about her Neck whereby she was choak'd till she was black in the Face and though it were got off before it had kill'd her yet there were the  red Marks of it and of a Finger and a Thumb near it remaining to be seen for some while afterwards these Children were often near burning and drowning and strangling themselves with their Neckcloths but still seasonably succor'd and to omit many other Circumstances they were at length deliver'd from this great Affliction  Mr  Mather  at the end of Fourteen Instances of this kind written by himself lays before us an Account of Visitations of the same Nature which happen'd in  NewEngland An  and written by Mr  John H  les  a Person who as Mr  Mather  says would not for a World be guilty of overdoing the Truth in an History of such Importance The Account is as follows  At the latter end of the Year Mr  Paris  Pastor of the Church in  Salem Village  had a Daughter of about Nine Years of Age and a Niece of about Eleven sadly afflicted with unaccountable Distempers as Physicians that were consulted thought and one of them judg'd they were betwitch'd Mr  Paris  had an  Indian  Man Servant and his Wife an  Indian  Woman who confess'd that without the Knowledge of their Master and Mistress they had taken some of the afflicted Persons Urine and mixing it with Meal had made a Cake and baked it to find out the Witch as they said After this the afflicted Persons cry'd out of the  Indian Woman  nam'd  Tituba  that she pinch'd prick'd and grievously tormented them and they saw her here and there where no Body else could and could tell where she was and what she did when she was absent from them these Children were bitten and pinch'd by invisible  Agents their Limbs were rack'd and tormented and miserably contorted  c Tituba  was Examined who confess'd the making of that Cake and said her  Mistress  in her own Country was a Witch and had taught her some means to be us'd for the discovery of a Witch and for preventing of being bewitch'd In a short time other Persons who were of Age to be Witnesses were molested by Satan and in their fits cry'd out upon  Tituba  and Goody  Orburn  and  Sarah Good  that they or  Spectres  in their shapes did grievously torment them The Justices at  Salem  examin'd the Afflicted and Accus'd together and upon the Examination  Tituba  confess'd that she was a Witch and that she and the other two accus'd did torment and bewitch the Complainers and that these with two others whose Names she knew not had their WitchMeetings together relating the times when and places where they met with other Circumstances Upon this  Tituba Osburn  and  Good  were committed to Prison on suspicion of acting Witchcraft Soon after these Afflicted Persons complain'd of others afflicting them in their Fits and the Number of the Afflicted and Accus'd began to increase and upon Examination more confess'd themselves guilty of the Crimes they were suspected of the Number of Confessors amounting at length to Fifty The Justices Judges and others concerned us'd all Conscientious endeavours to do what was right according to former Presidents in  England  in the like Cases The Matter was carryed on chiefly by the Complaints and Accusations of the Afflicted and by the Confessions of the Accus'd condemning themselves and others Yet Experience shew'd  that the more were apprehended the more were still afflicted and the Number of the Confessors encreasing did but increase the Number of the Accus'd and the executing of some made way for the apprehending of others for still the afflicted complain'd of being tormented by new Objects as the former were removed so that those that were concerned were amaz'd at the Number and quality of the Persons accus'd and fear'd Innocent Persons suffer'd and henceforth the Juries generally acquitted such as were try'd fearing they had gone too far before and all were set at Liberty ev'n the Confessors The Number of the Accus'd was increas'd to above an Hundred and many of them were Persons of blameless and holy Lives Nineteen were executed and all deny'd the Crime dying and some of them were knowing Persons and had before this been accounted blameless Livers The Persecution ceasing the Afflicted grew presently well the accus'd were quiet and for Five Years past there has been no Molestation by them So in  Suffolk  in  England  about the Year there was such a Prosecution till they saw that unless a stop were put to it it would bring all into Blood and Confusion The like has been in  France  till were put to Death and in some other Places the like So that  NewEngland  is not the only place circumvented by the Wiles of  Satan  in this kind He relates from  Wierus  p that an  Inquisitor  in the  Subalpine  Valleys enquir'd after Women Witches and burnt above an Hundred and was prosecuting more till the Country People rose and by force of Arms hindred them and refer'd the Matter to the Bishop  Their Husbands affirm'd that at that very time it was said of them that they play'd and danc'd under a Tree they were in Bed with them  At  Chelmsford  in  Essex An  there were at once before Judge  Coniers  and Fourteen of them Hang'd and an Hundred more detained in several Prisons in  Suffolk  and  Essex    As for the Case at  Salem  he conceives it proceeded from some mistaken Principles as that  Satan  cannot assume the shape of an Innocent Person and in that shape do Mischief to the Bodies and Goods of Mankind and that when the Devil does harm to Persons in their Bodies or Goods its at least for the most part by the help of our Neighbours some which are in Covenant with him This is the substance of what Mr  Hales  delivers and Mr  Mather  tells us that Mr  Hales  from whose Manuscript he Transcribed this does there Confute these mistaken Principles yet spends whole Chapters to prove that there is a Witch whom he thus defines Tis a Person that having the free use of his Reason does knowingly and wittingly obtain of the Devil or of any other Divine Power but the True God an ability to do or know strange things or things which he cannot by his own humane abilities arrive unto  Mr  Mather  in an  Appendix  at the end of his Sixth Chapter of his Sixth Book beforementioned gives a short Relation of some practises of Witchcraft used by the  Indians of New England  as follows  The  Indians  of  Martha  's  Vineyard  who are now  Christians  abundance of them acknowledge the Witchcraft wherein they had actual Conversations and explicit Confederacies with  Devils while they were  Pagons  They know that many Persons among them have been by the zeal of their Parents dedicated to their Infernal Gods and educated for their especial Service but that the  Daemons  accept only of some here and there to make  Pawaws  or  Wizards  of They know that these  Pawaws  often Imploy their  Daemons  to smite their Neighbours with Blindness and Lameness and other Mischiefs and sometimes to Kill them and sometimes to Cure their Maladies They know that their manner is to form a piece of Leather like an Arrow's Head and then tye an Hair to it or to take a Bone of some dead Creature over these things they use Magical Ceremonies whereupon the  Daemon  presently snatches them away and conveys them into the Bodies of Persons to be afflicted or sometime the  Daemon  pretends to them that he brings a portion of the Spirit of the Person closely imprison'd in a Fly and as they deal with the Fly so it fares with the Body of the Person intended Some of the  Pawaws  faculty chiefly consists in discovering and recovering Stoln Goods by the help of their  Daemons  A  Pawaw  turn'd  Christian  said he had often employed his God who appeared to him still in the form of a Snake to Kill Wound and Lame such as he design'd Mischief to So far Mr  Mather    I shall now give an Account of what Mr  Calef  above mentioned has deliver'd in his Book Entitled  More Wonders of the Invisible World  c  In his Preface he tells the Reader he publishes these his Collections and Sentiments in hopes that having well consider'd and compared them with the Scriptures he will see  Reason as well as himself to question a belief so prevalent as that there treated of as also the practise flowing from thence he declares his disbelief of the operations and effects of the Devil exprest by Mr  Mather  in his  Wonders of the Invisible World  as that the Devil exhibited himself ordinarily as a Black Man▪ and Decoy'd Miserable Malicious Creatures  o List themselves in his Service by entring their Names in a Book and that they have had their Meetings and Sacraments having each of them their  Spectres  or Devils commission'd by them and representing of them to be the Engines of their Malice By these wicked  Spectres  afflicting poor People with various Torments even Killing some and causing some to destroy themselves and carrying some over Trees and Hills Miles together many of them being tempted to sign the Devil's Laws  He takes this matter to be as others understand it  viz  that the Devil has been too hard for many in  New England  by his Temptatio  Signs and Lying Wonders with the help of pernicious Notions formerly imbibed and p  o  est together with the accusations of a  of Possest Distracted or lying Wenches accusing their Innocent Neighbours  they see their  Spectres  that is the  their likeness afflicting of them whereu  many Tragedies followed which tho'  one Parish spread over the whole Coun  ry and he thinks a Zeal led by Blindness and Passion and former Presidents had herein precipitated Persons into these wickednesses or Witchcrafts and says much the same has been acted this present Year in  Scotland    His Book being divided into Five Parts he begins his First Part with a Letter sent by Mr  Cotton Mather  to a Friend of his containing a Relation of an Apparition happening to one  Margaret Rule  living in the North part of  Boston  This young Woman on a  Sunday December  the  th  after some Hours of previous disturbance in the Publick Assembly fell into odd Fits which caused her Friends to carry her home where her Fits in a few Hours appeared to be preternatural She was assaulted by eight cruel  Spectres  of which she thought she knew three or four but the rest came still with their Faces cover'd she privately told Mr  Mather  the Names of those she knew Who says they were miserable Wretches that for many Years had been strongly suspected for Witches Those  Spectres  brought her a red thick Book not very broad about a Cubit long and demanded her to set her Hand to it or at least to touch it with her Hand as a sign of her becoming the Devil's Servant which she peremptorily refusing to do they fell a Tormenting her cruelly so that she was forced to keep her Bed six Weeks together Sometimes tho' not always together with the  Spectres  there look'd in upon her as she said a Short  Black Man  whom they called their  Master  being eaxctly of the same Dimensions Complexion and Voice with the Devil that has exhibited himself to other Infested People not only in other parts of  New England  but also in other Countries of  Europe  as relations from thence inform us She was cruelly Pinch'd with Invisible Hands very often in a Day and the Black and Blue Marks of the Pinches became immediately vivisible  to the standers by she would also be miserably hurt with Pins that were found stuck in her Neck Back and Arms though those Wounds made by the Pins would in a few Minutes ordinarily be cur'd she would also be strangely distorted in her Joints by Exorbitant Convulsions To pass by other strange Relations of her in which Mr  Mather  thinks there could be no Imposture once in the middle of the Night she lamented sadly that the  Spectres  threatn'd the drowning of a Young Man in the Neighbourhood whom she nam'd to the Company and it was found that at that very time this Young Man having been Press'd on Board a Man of War then in the Harbour was attempting to Swim on Shoar and had been drown'd in the Attempt if a Boat had not seasonably took him up There were wonderful Noises every now and then made about the Room where she lay which the Persons present could ascribe to no other Actors but the  Spectres  Once her Tormentors pull'd her up to the Ceiling of her Chamber and held her there before a very Numerous Company of Spectators who found it as much as they could all do to pull her down again She had also a White Spirit which came to her whose bright shining and glorious Garments she had a frequent view of He stood by her Bed continually heart'ning and comforting of her and Counseling her to maintain her Faith and Hope in God and never to comply with the Temptations of her Adversaries Mr  Mather  says he has seen it fulfil'd more than three times in the Deliverance of inchanted and possess'd Persons whom God has cast in his way that their Deliverance could not be obtain'd before  the third Fast kept for them and the third Day still obtain'd the Deliverance and after  Margaret Rule  had been more than Five Weeks in her Miseries the White Spirit said to her Well this Day such a Man whom he nam'd has kept a third Day for your Deliverance now be of Good Chear you shall speedily be deliver'd Mr  Mather  enquir'd whether what had been said of that Man were true and was certainly inform'd that it was precisely so On the last Day of the Week her Tormentors as she said approaching towards her would be forc'd still to recoil and retire as unaccountably unable to meddle with her and they would retire to the Fire side with their Puppets but going to stick Pins in those Puppets they could not make the Pins to enter and she saw their Black Master to strike them and kick them to make them do their Work and renew the Marks of his Vengeance on them when they fail'd of doing it At last being as it were tir'd with their ineffectual Attempts to mortifie her they furiously said  Well thou shalt not be the last  and after a pause they added  Go and the Devil go with you we can do no more  Whereupon they flew out of the Room and she returning perfectly to her self gave thanks to God for her Deliverance Her Tormentors left her extream Weak and  aint and overwhelm'd with Vapours which would not only cause her sometimes to fall in a Swoon but likewise now and then for a little while discompose her Reason though her former troubles returned not  To this Relation Mr  M  ther  adds He has always been of this Opinion that we are Ignorant of what Powers the Devils may have  to do their Mischiefs in the shapes of some that had never been explicitely engag'd in Diabolical Confederacies and that therefore though many Witchcrafts had been fairly detected on enquiries provok'd and begun by  Spectre Apparitions  yet himself has been so far for abating the excessive Credit of  Spectres Accusations  that he still charg'd the Afflicted committed to his Care that they should cry out on no Body for afflicting them though if it might be of any Advantage to them they might tell their Minds to some one Person of Discretion enough to make no ill use of it Nor had the Civil Authority prosecuted those things had not a Conscientious regard to the Crys of Miserable Families overcome the Reluctancies of the Judges to meddle with them  The Second Part of this Book begins with a Narrative of what past at two Visits given by Mr  Cotton Mather  and his  Father  to  Margaret Rule  written by Mr  Calef  as he says from the Mouths of some Persons who were then present of which Narrative Mr  Cotton Mather  greatly complains as very unfairly and falsly representing things in referenee to his Father and himself  It contains also Letters from Mr  Calef  to Mr  Cotton Mather  offering a meeting with him and desiring an Information in some Doctrinals relating to Witchcraft which meeting Mr  Mather  declin'd at the place nominated by Mr  Calef  though he offered to Discourse with him concerning it in his Study or any other Convenient place There are also Papers attested by several Hands of Persons present that  Margaret Rule  was lifted up to the Ceiling of the Room where she lay by  an invisible Hand and that several of the Persons present had much ado with all their strength to pull her down This is followed by another Letter from Mr  Calef  to Mr  Mather  in which notwithstanding the Attestations of the Persons present he declares his disbelief of  Margaret Rule  's being so lifted up his reason is that then Miracles are not ceas'd this seeming to him as true a Miracle as for Iron to Swim and that the Devil can work such Miracles  Next follows several Letters from Mr  Calef  to Mr  Mather  and others relating to the Doctrinals of Witchcraft both desiring Mr  Mather  to explain it and setting forth what himself conceives of it according to the Scriptures and having Inserted a Letter which he writ to the Ministers whether  English French  or  Dutch  in  New England  he concludes it thus That the only Decisive Circumstance to Convict a Witch as far as he can find in the Scriptures is a maligning and oppugning the Word Work or Worship of God and by any extraordinary Sign seeking to seduce any from it tho' not excluding any other Branch when as well prov'd by that Infallible Rule and that the going to the afflicted or possest to Divine who are Witches by their  SpectreSight  is a great wickedness and that the searching for Tets the experiment of their saying the Lords Prayer the falling at the Sight and rising at the Touch of the supposed Criminal being all of them foreign from Scripture as well as Reason are Abominations to be Abhorr'd and Repented of Lastly That their  Salem  Witchcraft either respecting the Judges and Juries and their tenderness of Life or the  multitude and pertinency of Witnesses both afflicted and confessors or the integrity of Historians are as Authentick and made as certain as any ever of that kind in the World have been and yet every one now sees through it and that it was the abovementioned Sentiments that procured this saddest Affliction and most lasting Infamy that ever befel that Country Mr  Calef  's next Letter is to Mr  Samuel Willard  a Member of  Harward College  in  New England  where among other things he says that by the late Prosecution under the notion of Witches Twenty suffered as Evil Doers besides those that Died in Prison above Ten more Condemned and an Hundred Imprison'd and about more Accused and the Country generally in Fears when it would come to their turn to be Accused that those very Accusers which had been Imprisoned as Witnesses against so many Accused at length those in most High Esteem both Magistrates and Ministers as guilty of Witchcraft which shew'd their Rulers that necessity lay upon them to confound what had so long confounded the Country as being unwilling to run the same risque  Mr  Mather  having sent Mr  Calef  a Book Printed by Mr  Baxter  Entitled  The certainty of the World of Spirits  for his Instruction in that kind Mr  Calef  has here inserted a Letter which he sent to Mr  Mather  containing Animadversions on that Book And in another Letter which he Writ to the Ministers in and near  Boston  he speaks of the Doctrine of the  Manicheans  and endavours to shew that the present Age is not free from that Infection and ascribes the deluge of Bloodshed among  Christians to this that Men having taken up a belief of a Covenanting Afflicting and Killing Witch and finding no footsteps of such a Witch in the Scriptures have concluded that though the Scriptures be full in it that a Witch should not Live yet that it has not at all described the Crime nor means whereby the Culpable might be detected and hence they account it necessary to make use of those Diabolical and Bloody ways always heretofore practised for their Discovery finding that the Rules given to detect other Crimes are wholly useless for the discovery of such  Mr  Calef  's last Letter of his Second Part is to Mr  Benjamin Wadsworth  a Minister whom he seems to charge with not well explaining the Scriptures in reference to Witchcraft and says the late dangerous Notion that the Devil appears to Persons and that they and the Devil make mutual Ingagements Confirm'd by Signing the Devil's Book and are from hence Inabled not only to know Futurities and things done at a Distance but are also Impower'd thereby to do harm to Neighbours to raise Storms and do things above and against the Course of Nature has been the occasion of shedding so much Blood in the World He adds It's manifest that the belief of the Witches Power to do the things abovementioned was an ancient belief of the  Heathens  and that from them it was received by the  Papists  who have since Improved upon it and brought in the notion of a Covenant and that  Protestants  seem to have lately Improved it farther by saying that Witches can Commissionate Devils to do those Mischiefs thereby setting the Witch in the place of God  He has writ also in a precedent Letter that two Parties in dispute were not agreed which to put it upon whether the Devil Impowers the Witch or the Witch Commissions him on the Contract but both Parties are agreed in this that one way or other the Mischief is effected and so the Criminal becomes Guilty of Death in the search after which Criminals many Countries have fallen into such Convulsions that neither the Devastation made by a Conquering Enemy nor the Plague it self has been so formidable  The Third Part of this Book gives an account of the Differences happening at  Salem Village  on the account of Prosecutions for Witchcraft which began there where one Mr  Paris  was Pastor who notwithstanding his acknowledging some Errors he might have fallen into in that respect was at last dismist from that Cure In his acknowledgment under his hand he owns that the horrid Calamity of afflicting that Country broke out first in his House and that in his Family there were some of both Parties  viz  Accusers and Accused  The Fourth Part contains an Ingenious Letter Writ by a Gentleman without a Name endeavouring to prove the commonly receiv'd Opinion about Witchcraft to which Mr  Calef  has Written a Reply And a Second Letter is Written by the foresaid Gentleman to which Mr  Calef  has a Rejoynder  The Fifth Part contains an account of the most Memorable matters of Fact touching the supposed Witchcraft in  New England  Now tho' Mr  Calef  's Account of Facts contains many more Particulars than what I have set  down before from Mr  Hal  's yet since they would be too tedious for me to insert here I shall only note some odd passages in them  He tells us that about the end of the Year a new Scene relating to Witchcraft was begun One  Joseph Ballard  at  Andover  whose Wife was Ill and after Died of a Fever sent to  Salem  for some of those Accusers to tell him who Afflicted his Wife others did the same and Horse and Man were sent from several places to fetch those Accusers who had the  Spectre Sight  that they might thereby tell who afflicted those that were any way Ill When these came into any place where such were usually they fell into a Fit after which being ask'd who it was that afflicted the Person they would for the most part name one whom they said sat on the Head and another that sat on the lower parts of the afflicted Soon after  Ballard  's sending more than Fifty of the People of  Andover  were complain'd of for afflicting their Neighbours Here it was that many accused themselves of riding upon Poles through the Air many Parents believing their Children to be Witches and many Husbands their Wives  c  when these Accusers came to the House of any Person upon such an Account it was ordinary for other Young People to be taken with Fits and to have the same  Spectre Sight  Mr  Dudley Bradstreet  a Justice of Peace in  Andover  having granted out Warrants and Committed Thirty or Forty Persons to Prisons for the supposed Witchcrafts at length saw cause to forbear granting out any more Warrants soon after which he and his Wife were cry'd out of himself was by them said to have Kill'd Nine Persons by Witchcraft  and found it his safest course to make his Escape  A Dog being afflicted at  Salem  Village and those that had the  Spectre Sight  being sent for they accused Mr  John Bradstreet  Brother to the Justice that he afflicted the said Dog and now Rid upon him he made his Escape into  Petattequa  Government and the Dog was put to Death and was all of the afflicted that suffered Death  At  Andover  they complain'd of a Dog as afflicting of them and would fall into their Fits at the Dogs looking on them The Dog was put to Death  Note  In reference to this that in my precedent Account of the  Second Sight  Children Horses and Cows had it as well as Men and Women    A worthy Gentleman of  Boston  being about this time accused by those of  Andover  he sent by some particular Friends a Writ to Arrest those Accusers in a  l  Action for Defamation with Instructions to inform themselves of the certainty of the Proof in doing which their business was perceived and from thence forward the Accusation at  Andover  generally ceas'd  And now Nineteen Persons being Hang'd and One Press'd to Death and Eight more Condemned in all Twenty Eight about Fifty having confest themselves to be Witches of which not One Executed about One Hundred and Fifty in Prison and above Two Hundred more Accused the Special Commission of  Oyer  and  Terminer  came to a Period after which Six Women who had confessed themselves to be Witches gave under their Hand that they did it only in complyance with their nearest Friends who told them it was their only way to escape  As for the Tryals and the Evidence taken for Conviction at  Salem  they are set forth in Print by Mr  Cotton Mather  in his  Wonders of the Invisible World  at the Command of Sir  William Phips  then Governour of  New England  but Mr  Calef  considering that his Book might fall into the hands of such as never saw those Wonders has Transcribed here the whole Account he has given thereof without any variation but with one of the  Indictments  annext to the Tryal of each After Mr  Calef  has set down Mr  Mather  's said Account of the Proceedings at  Salem  he writes some Animadversions on it and then proceeds to give an Account of the proceedings in the like case at  CharlesTown Boston  and other places and concludes with a Proclamation at last Issu'd out by the Lieutenant Governour Counsel and Assembly of the  Massachusetts Bay  wherein they beg God Pardon for any Errors might have been committed in the late Prosecutions And upon the Day of Fast in the full Assembly at the South MeetingHouse in  Boston  one of the Judges who had sat in Judicature at  Salem  delivered in a Paper desiring the Prayers of the People to the like effect And some that had been of several Juries gave forth a Paper sign'd with their own Hands owning that they fear'd they had been sadly Deluded and Mistaken and beg'd Pardon of God and their Country Men for what had past and declaring that none of them would do such things again on such Grounds for the whole World  I thought good to give this Account at large of the two foregoing Books because they give us a full Information of the last considerable  Visitation by Witchcrafts or so supposed that has happned to any Country in the World and I hope it may be a farewel to them  As to my own Opinion in these Matters I am convinced by my own Experience which to me is as a Thousand Witnesses that there is such a thing as a  SpectreSight  so that one Person may see  Spectres  when others present at the same time see nothing wherefore I think it not Impossible that the afflicted Persons in  New England  should see nay I believe they saw the  Spectres  of Persons who as they conceived Tormented them all Histories of Witches both in  England  and in all other Countries testifying the same tho' I no way think that such  SpectreSight  should be received a Judicial Proof against any Person it being manifest by some foregoing Examples that it's at least sometimes subject to Illusions of which I shall here add a particular Instance from  Frommannus  who in his Third Book of  Magical Incantation    Part    cap    Dub    p    quotes the Author of Criminal Cautions writing thus  A Prince of  Germany  Invited two Religious Fathers of eminent Vertue and Learning to a Dinner The Prince at the Table said to one of them Father Think you we do rightly in Hanging Persons who are accused by Ten or Twelve Witches to have appear'd at their Meetings or Sabbaths I somewhat fear we are Imposed on by the Devil and that it is not a safe way to Truth that we walk in by these Accusations especially since many Grave and Learned Men every where begin to cry out against it and to charge our Consciences with it tell me therefore your Opinion To whom the Father being somewhat of an  eager Spirit said what should make us doubtful in this Case or what should touch our Consciences being convinced by so many Testimonies Can we make it a Scruple whether God will permit Innocent Persons should be so traduc'd there is no cause for a Judge to stick at such a number of Accusations but he may proceed with safety To which when the Prince had reply'd and much had been said  pro  and  con  on both sides about it and the Father seem'd wholly to carry the Point the Prince at length concluded the Dispute saying I am sorry for you Father that in a Capital Case you have Condemned your self and you cannot complain if I commit you to Custody for no less than Fifteen Witches have deposed that they have seen you at their Meetings and to shew you that I am not in Jest I will presently cause the publick Acts to be brought for you to Read them The Father stood in a Maze and with a Dejected Countenance had nothing here to oppose but Confusion and Silence after all his Learned Eloquence So far  Frommannus    It's observable that when the  SpectreSighted  Accusers came to an House to discover who afflicted a Person taken Ill it was ordinary for other Young People to be taken in Fits like the  SpectreSighted  Persons and to have the same  SpectreSight  as we know if a Person falls into Convulsion Fits in the presence of Young Persons it's usual for these to fall into Convulsions also  This strange Visitation in  New England  in which Persons were seized with strange Fits and came to have a  SpectreSight  seems to be ally'd to what  Plutarch  in his Book of  the Vertuous  Acts of Women  relates concerning the  Milesian Virgins  as follows  There was a time that the  Milesian Virgins  fell into a strange Humour and raving without any apparent Cause only it was suspected that there was some Venemous Constitution of the Air which caus'd in them this  Delirium  and alienation of Mind for they all on a sudden were seiz'd with a desire to die and a furious Inclination to hang themselves and there were many that secretly did it and no Remonstrance nor Tears of their Parents nor Consolation of Friends avail'd any thing but they would Destroy themselves and they always found means to elude all the Subtleties and Inventions of those that Watch'd them So that it was look'd upon as some Divine Punishment which no Humane Provision could remedy till at length by the advice of a wise Citizen an  Edict  was set forth that if any Person should hang her self for the future her Body should be carryed Naked through the open Streets in the sight of all Men which put a full stop to this Tragedy And if instead of an Indulgent  Non Compos  found generally by our Juries of late on all  Felo's de se  somewhat exemplary were order'd by the Government possibly it might deter Persons from that Crime  Plutarch  Notes it as a sign of a Good and Vertuous Disposition that the fear of Infamy and Dishonour works more upon Humane Minds than the fear of those horrible Accidents Death and Torments  Rhodiginus  writes thus Its said the  Abderites    Ant Lect l    c    while  Lysimachus  rul'd began to be infested with a certain New and Wonderfull kind of Disease the manner of it was thus First  there generally reign'd among them a fierce and burning Fever when the Seventh Day was come an abundance of Blood flow'd from their Nostrils some fell into a plentiful Sweat and this ended the Fever but a very Ridiculous affect seiz'd the Minds of them all for they were stir'd up to Act Tragedies and thunder'd out Iambicks with a very loud Voice but chiefly the Tragedy of  Andromeda  writ by  Euripides  and the words of  Perseus  the City was fill'd with these kinds of weekly Tragedies the People bawling out these and the like kind of Words  O King thou Love of Gods and Men  This unusual  Delirium  held a long while till the Winter and a fierce Cold coming put an end to the Evil It's thought the rise of this Disease proceeded from this That at that time  Archelaus  a Famous Tragedian in the midst of the Summer when the Heats were very great Acted there  Andromeda  whereupon the  Abderites  contracted the cause of their Disease in the Theater and when as its usual the Appearances of what was Acted in that Tragedy were presented to their Minds they fell to the said Tragedy through a  Delirium  upon their Recovery  Andromeda  sticking in their Memories and  Persus  with  Medusa    L    c    As to a Disposition of the Air in Reference to a  SpectreSight Purchas  in the Second part of his  Pilgrim  writes from a Relation of  Sandys  's Journey from  Venice  to  Constantinople  as follows We lay in a little Bay and under a Clift in the Gulf of  Calonus  where not one of us but had his Sleep interrupted by fearful Dreams he that watch'd affirming that he had seen the Devil so that in a great dismay we put from the shore about midnight but whether it proceeded  from the Nature of the Vaporous place or that infested by some Spirit I leave to decide It's reported of a little Rocky Island hard by nam'd formerly  Aex  Sacred to  Neptune  that none could Sleep on it for being troubl'd with Apparitions The Gulf belongs to the Island  Mitylen  or  Lesbos    Thus we find what Dispositions of Mind Men may fall into sundry ways and how far the Diabolical seisures relating to practices of Witchcrafts may be caus'd upon the Minds of Miserable People being impregnated with Notions of  Daemons  and the like and what Communication of Minds there may be betwixt such People will deserve Consideration  Hippocrates  in his Tract of  Virgins Diseases  if it be his enquires into the Nature and Causes of such Distempers as Afflicted the  Milesian  Virgins and considers the Disease call'd  Sacred  which he says is attended with Frights and Terrors by which Persons are Vehemently scar'd so that they grow Delirious and sometimes by Night sometimes by Day and sometimes both Night and Day they think they see  Daemons  infesting them and that upon those Visions many have hang'd themselves though more Women than Men they being of a weaker Disposition of Mind and Virgins that are almost ripe for Marriage find this about the time of the first descent of their  Menses  being free from those Evils before but about that time the due Course of the Blood being stopt it returns up to the Heart and Midriff causing an acute Inflammation and brings an alienation of Mind with Crys and Terrors and sometimes he says without  Spectres  a certain Pleasure of Death seizes them as seeming a good Thing  as they return to themselves he says the Women are wont to Consecrate their most precious Garments with other things to  Diana  being deceiv'd by the Prophets who Command them so to do  Now though the Causes assign'd by  Hippocrates  seems plausible enough for him as a Physician yet I doubt they will not reach all Cases and we must have recourse to a Superiour Science for them It's known to the Learned that there has been a Science in the World call'd  Scientia Umbrarum  which as to the publick teaching of it has been suppress'd upon good Politick grounds though there are still some Societies of Men in the World who allow the study of it and teach it to Persons of whose Integrity they are satisfied and as  Boesatas  says of Magick of which this is apart  Est tanquam res Sacra quae no nisiviris magnis peculiari beneficio de caelo instructis Communicatur nil ausi sunt aggredi quidam Principes in Politicis in Sacris in consibiis sine eorum arbitrio    Calumella  knew there was a Science built on Higher Principles than what are accountable for in  Physicks  when he said concerning the Cure of his Bees  De cult Hort l    At sit nulla valet Medicina repellere pestem  Dardaniae veniant artes  But if this Plague no Medicine can repel  To Arts  Dardanian  let us fly  The  Scientia Umbrarum  being a Branch of these Arts the Ignorance of which possibly may have been the occasion of many mistakes in Judicial proceedings relating to Witchcraft  the Dispositions of the  Astral Man  being knowable only by that Science And though many Severities have followed upon it yet good Policy perhaps has rather chosen to suffer them than to admit the Publick teaching of that Science which might have been of more Pernicious consequence to the Publick But I write these things only by the by and as opening  It seems to me that Mr  Calef  deals somewhat hardly with Mr  Mather  in this that when for his satisfaction Mr  Mather  had sent him a Paper attested by several Subscribers that  Margaret Rule  with whom they were present was lifted up to the Ceiling of the Room and that several times notwithstanding the Endeavours of strong Persons to keep her down and there held her for a considerable time and that they had much ado to pull her down yet Mr  Calef  declares his disbelief of it for this reason that then Miracles are not ceas'd as though a manifest Experience were to be so exploded I have giv'n before two Experiences in the like kind one from Mr  Glanvil  concerning a Person so lifted up in the Lord  Orery  's House in  Ireland  another from  Wierus  a Person well known to have been of no Light belief who declares that a Woman had been carried up in the Air by Spirits if himself had not violently withheld her and kept her down As to his great Ground of the Cessation of Miracles I well know many Learned Divines have been of that Opinion though I think it no such Essential Point of Faith that Christianity cannot well consist without it Dr  Brown  in his  Religio Medici  writes thus That Miracles are ceas'd I can neither prove  Sect    nor absolutely deny much less define the time  and period of the Cessation  Sect    And again Therefore that Miracles have been I do believe and that they may yet be wrought by the living I do not deny and Dr  Stubbe  in his Account of the  Miraculous Cures wrought by  Mr  Greatrix  writes according to the Impetuosity of his Spirit That to say Miracles are ceas'd is a groundless Folly if not a disingenious Impudence in giving the Lye to various Religions And if Mr  Calef  admitted the point of  Margaret Rule  's being so lifted up I cannot see why this must be concluded a Miracle unless all things Providence permits the Devil to act and which seem strange shall be called Miracles  And whereas Mr  Calef  so often urges Mr  Mather  with Mr  Gaule  's Fourth Head for Convicting a Witch  viz  That a Witch is one that maligns and oppugns the Word Work or Worship of God and by any Extraordinary signs seeks to seduce any from it as appears  Deut    Matth    Act    Tim  which Mr  Calef  will have to be the only Head well prov'd in the Scripture for discovering a Witch and often challenges Mr  Mather  to produce any other and says That his not bringing plain Scripture Proof that there is a Covenanting Witch is a sufficient Demonstration there is none it's no consequence but there may be such a Witch and that fairly reducable to the Head of Witchcraft mention'd in the Scriptures for as there are New Diseases of the Body which were unknown to the Ancients so I know not why there may not be New Distempers of the Mind all Crimes being such and since Mr  Calef  stands so much for plain Scripture Proof for what he Credits he may do well to give us a  plain convincing Scripture Proof setting by his own Glosses for the ceasing of Miracles or of the time that Providence tyed up its Hands from doing any thing beside the ordinary course of Nature or from commanding or permitting any Good or Evil Angels to do any such thing  I think it worthy Consideration that in the Account the abovemention'd Mr  Greatrix  gave of himself and his Actions in a Letter to the late Mr  Boyle  Printed in  London An  there seems a strange Agreement in some Particulars with what happen'd in the  NewEngland  Visitation for as the Persons there Afflicted assoon as they look'd on those that Afflicted them would fall down in Fits so Mr  Greatrix  writes somewhat of the like Nature relating to himself addressing himself to Mr  Boyle  as follows  Sir  I hope you will Pardon me when I relate to you my own Observations and what my Experience inclines me to believe in saying that I have met with several Instances which seem'd to me to be Possession by Dumb Deaf and talking Devils and that to my Apprehension and others present several Evil Spirits one after the other have been pursued out of a Woman and every one of them has been like to Choak her when it came up to her Throat before it went forth and when the last was gone she was perfectly well and so continued There have been others that have fall'n down immediately assoon as they have seen me which the Mayor of  Worcester  Colonel  Birch  Major  Wilde  and many Hundreds both at  Worcester  and here in  London  and other Places were EyeWitnesses of Many when they have  heard my Voice have been tormented in so strange a manner that no one present could conceive it less than a Possession as I will Instance in one at  Yorkhouse  where Sir  John Hinton  Colonel  Talbot  and many others were present who had somewhat within her which would swell her Body to that excessive Degree on a sudden as if it would burst her and then assoon as I put my Hand on that part of her Body where it did rise up it would fly up to her Throat or some other place and cause her Neck to swell half so big again and then almost Choak her then Blind her and make her Dumb and Foam and sometimes fly into her Hand and so contract and fast'n it that neither Sir  John Hinton  or any else that did try as there were many could with all their strength open one Finger of her hand nor would it fly his Hand in the least nor any other Persons there till I put my Hand on it or my Glove nay I oftentimes brought it up into her Tongue by running my Hand on her Body on the outside of her Cloaths up to her Throat which was swoll'n in an Instant as big again and has been seen plainly to fly from place to place and at length with great violence of Belching which did almost Choak her and force her Eyes to start out of her Head it went forth and so the Woman went away well Whether this were a Natural Distemper let any one Judge that is either  Divine Philosopher  or  Physician  I could Instance you in Forty as strange or stranger but I will go no farther then  London  and Places adjoyning for Instances of this Nature  He adds beneath  That going to the Town of  Copoqueen  in  Ireland  there were many Poor People that came out of  England  for several Distempers they labour'd under and among the rest two that had the FallingSickness who no sooner saw me but they fell into their Fits immediately and upon putting my Hands on them they were restor'd to their Senses forthwith and he pursued their Pains from place to place till they went out of them  So far Mr  Greatrix    Here we find that as the Persons Afflicted in  NewEngland  assoon as they look'd on the Afflictors or so by them suppos'd fell into their Fits and were restor'd to themselves upon the Afflictors touching them so the Distemper'd Persons assoon as they look'd on Mr  Greatrix  fell into their Fits and upon his touching them were recover'd  There was a Book Printed in  London An  intitl'd  Enthusiasmus Triumphatus  written by one who assum'd the Name of  Philosophilus Parresiastes  near the end of which we find a Relation of a Person who had a Power of healing by stroaking like that of Mr  Greatrix  The Relation is thus  p  It's very credibly Reported and I think cannot be deny'd That one by the stroaking of a Mans Arm that was dead and useless to him recover'd it to life and strength When I heard of it and read some few Pages of that Miraculous Physicians writing my Judgment was that the Cure was Natural but that his Blood and Spirits were boil'd to that height that it would hazard his Brain which proved true for he was stark mad not very long after  Now however this Person might have valued his Skill in judging of an ensuing madness in such Cases the effect having followed here according to his guess yet we find it will not hold in all Cases Mr  Greatrix  having always liv'd free from any such Sequel  To proceed to other Accounts of Persons who have had a Perception of  Genii  or Spirits not visible at the same time to others The Famous  Torquatus Tasso  Prince of the  Italian Poets  strongly asserted his own Experience in that kind His Life was writ and publish'd in  French An  by  D C  D D U who in his Preface tells us that in what he has writ he has followed chiefly the History given us in  Italian  by  John Baptista Manso  a  Neapolitan  Gent who had been a very Intimate Friend to  Tasso  In his Life among other things he acquaints us that  Tasso  was Naturally of that Melancholick Temperament which has always made the greatest Men and that this Temperament being aggravated by many hardships he had undergone it had made him sometimes beside himself and that those Melancholick Vapours being dissipated he came again to himself like those that return from Fits of the FallingSickness his Spirit being free as before That near his later end he retired from the City of  Naples  to his Friend  Manso  at  Bisaccia  a small Town in the Kingdom of  Naples  where  Manso  had a considerable Estate and pass'd an Autumn there in the Divertisements of the Season as Hunting visiting Ladies and frequenting other Companies  c  And here the  French  Author gives us an Account of  Tasso  's Sensible Perception of a  Genius  as follows As after these Amusements he usually retir'd to his  Chamber to entertain himself there with his Friend  Manso  the later had the Opportunity to enquire into one of the most singular effects of  Tasso  's Melancholy of this Heroick Melancholy as I may call it which rais'd his Spirit so far it was from rendring it obscure and which among the Ancients would have caus'd them to have ascrib'd a  Familiar Daemon  to him as to  Socrates  They were often in an hot dispute concerning this Spirit with which  Tasso  pretended to have a Communication I am too much your Friend said  Manso  to him one Day not to let you know what the World thinks of you concerning this thing and what I think of it my self Is it possible that being enlightn'd as you are you should be fall'n into so great a Weakness as to think you have a  Familiar Spirit  and will you give your Enemies that Advantage to be able to prove by your own acknowledgment what they have publish'd to the World You know they say you did not publish your  Dialogue of the Messenger  as a Fiction but you would have Men believe that the Spirit which you make to speak there was a real and true Spirit so that Men have thence drawn this Injurious Consequence that your Studies have embroil'd your Imagination so that there is made in it a confus'd Mixture of the Fictions of the Poets the Inventions of the Philosophers and the Doctrine of Religion I am not Ignorant answer'd  Tasso  of all that is spread abroad in the World on the Account of my  Dialogue  I have taken care divers times to disabuse my Friends both by Letter and word of Mouth I prevented ev'n the Malignity of my Enemies as you know at the time I publish'd my  Dialogue  Men could not  be Ignorant that I compos'd it for the Young Prince of  Mantua  to whom I would explain after an agreeable Manner the Principal Mysteries of the  Platonick  Philosophy It was at  Mantua  it self after my second flight from  Ferrara  that I form'd the  Idea  of it and I committed it to Paper a little while after my unfortunate return I address'd it to this Prince and all Men might have read in the  Epistle Dedicatory  the Protestation I there make that this  Dialogue  being writ according to the Doctrine of the  Platonicks  which is not always conformable to reveal'd Truths Men must not confound what I expose there as a  Philosopher  with what I believe as a  Christian  This Distinction is by so much the more reasonable that at that time nothing extraordinary had happen'd to me and I spake not of any Apparition This can be attested by all those with whom I lodged or frequented in this Voyage and therefore there is no reason for confounding the Fiction of my  Dialogue  with what has happen'd to me since I am perswaded of all you say to me reply'd  Manso  but truly I cannot be of what you believe at present concerning your self Will you Imagine to your self that you are in Commerce with a Spirit And I ask you of what Order is that Spirit Shall us place him in the Number of the Rebels whom their Pride precipitated into the Abyss Or of the Intelligences who continued firm in Faith and Submission to their Creator For there is no mean to take in the true Religion and we must not fall into the Extravagances of the  Gnomes  and  Silphes  of the  Cabalists    Now the Spirit in question cannot be a  Daemon  you own that instead of Inspiring you any thing contrary to Piety and Religion he often fortifies in you the  Maxims  of Christianity he strengthens your Faith by profound Reasonings and has the same respect with you for Sacred Names and Things Neither can you say that It's an  Angel  for tho' you have always led a Regular Life and far from all Dissoluteness tho' for some Years past you have apply'd your self after a particular manner to the Duties of a True Christian you will agree with me that these sorts of Favours are not common that a Man must have attained to an high degree of Sanctity and not be far from the Pureness of Celestial Spirits to merit a familiar Converse and bear an Harmony with them Believe me there is nothing in all these Discourses which you imagine you have with this Spirit You know better than any Man those Symptoms which the black Humours wherewith you are Tormented causes in you Your Vapours are the sourse of your Visions and your self would not judge otherwise of another Person to whom a like thing should happen and you will come to this in your own respect also if you will make a mature reflection and apply your self to blot out by an effort of Reason these Imaginations which the violence of your evil effect causes in you You may have Reason reply'd  Tasso  to think so of the things that pass in me but as to my self who have a sensible perception of them I am forced to reason after another manner If it were true that the Spirit did not shew himself to me but in the Violent Assault of my  Vapours If he offer'd to my Imagination but wandring and confus'd  Species  without Connection or due Sequel if he used to me frivolous Reasonings which ended in nothing or if having begun some solid Reasoning he left it off on a sudden and left me in darkness I should believe with you that all that passes is but Dreams and Fantoms but it's quite otherwise This Spirit is a Spirit of Truth and Reason and of a Truth so distinct of a Reason so sublime that he raises me often to Knowledges that are above all my Reasonings tho' they appear to me no less clear that he teaches me things which in my most Profound Meditations never came into my Spirit and which I never heard of any Man nor read in any Book This Spirit therefore is somewhat of Real of whatsoever order he be I hear him and see him nevertheless for its being impossible for me to comprehend and define him  Manso  did not yield to these Facts which  Tasso  would have pass'd for Proofs he prest him with new  Questions  which were not without  Answers  Since you will not believe me on my Word said  Tasso  to him another Day after having well Disputed I must convince you by your own Eyes that these things are not pure Imaginations and the next Day conversing together in the same Chamber  Manso  perceived that on a suden he fixt his Eyes towards the Window and that he stood as it were Immovable he call'd to him and jogg'd him many times but instead of Answering him  See there the Spirit  says  Tasso  at last  that has been pleased to come and visit me and to entertain himself with me look on him and you will acknowledge the  Truth of what I say Manso  somewhat surprised cast his Eyes towards the place he shew'd him and perceived nothing but the Rays of the Sun passing through the Glass nor did he see any thing in all the Chamber tho' he cast his Eyes round it with curiosity and he desired him to shew him the Spirit which he look'd for in vain while he heard  Tasso  speak with much Vehemency He declares in a Letter which he writ concerning this to the Admiral of  Naples  that he really heard no other Voice but  Tasso  's own but they were sometimes  Questions  made by him to the pretended Spirit sometimes  Answers  that he made to the pretended  Questions  of the Spirit and which were conceived in such admirable Terms so Efficacious concerning Subjects so Elevated and so Extraordinary that he was Ravish'd with Admiration and dared not to Interrupt him He hearken'd therefore Attentively and being quite beside himself at this mysterious Conversation which ended at last by a recess of the Spirit as he found by the last words of  Tasso  after which  Tasso  turning himself to him Well said he are your doubts at last dissipated on the contrary answer'd  Manso  I am more Imbroyled than ever I have truly heard wonderful things but you have not shew'd me what you promised me You have seen and heard resum'd  Tasso  perhaps more than he stopt here and  Manso  who could not recover himself of his surprise and had his Head fill'd with the  Ideas  of this extraordinary entertainment found not himself in a condition to press him farther Mean while he ingaged himself not to speak a word to any Man of these things he had heard with a design  to make them Pu  lick tho' he should have liberty granted him They had many other conversations concerning this Matter after which  Manso  own'd he was brought to that pass that he knew not what to think or say only that if it were a weakness in his Friend to believe these Visions he much fear'd it would prove Contagious to him and that he should become at last as credulous as himself  I was willing to set down this Relation at large because I think it contains a sufficient Answer to what many Learned Friends have said to my self on the like occasion  Perhaps it may not be ungrateful to the Reader if I subjoyn here the short  Eloge  writ on  Tasso  by the Famous  Thuanus  which is as follows  Torquatus Tasso  died about the Forty Fifth Year of his Age a Man of a wonderful and prodigious Wit who was seized with an incurable Fury in his Youth when he lived at the Court of  Ferrara  and nevertheless in lucid Intervals he writ many things both in Verse and Prose with so much Judgment Elegancy and extream Correctness of Style that he turn'd at length that Pity which many Men had conceived for him into an Amazement while by that Fury which in others makes their Minds outragious or dulls them after it was over his Understanding became as it were purified more ready in Inventing things more accute in aptly disposing them after they were Invented and more copious in adorning them with choice of Words and weight of Sentences and that which a Man of the soundest Sense would scarce excogitate at his Leisure with the greatest Labour and  Care imaginable he after a violent agitation of the Mind set beside it self naturally perform'd with a wonderful Felicity so that he did not seem struck with an alienation of Mind but with a Divine Fury He that knows not these things which all Men know that have been in  Italy  and concerning which himself sometimes complains tho' modestly in his Writings let him Read his Divine Works and he must necessarily conclude either that I speak of another Man than  Tasso  or that these things were written by another Man than  Tasso    What shall we say of  Horace  as to a sensible perception of Spirits who seems to desire Posterity to believe him where he says  Bachum in remotis Carmina montibus  Vidi docentem credite posteri  Nymphasque discentes  Carm l    Ode    aures  Capripedum satyrorum acutas  Evoe recenti mens trepidat metu  Bacchus in distant Rocks I've seen  Teach Charms and Nymphs to learn of him  Believe it and the prick'd up Ears  Of Goatfeet Satyrs  Oh  it Scares  Me still to think on't with new Fears  And I know not why  Horace  tho' an  Epicurean  being Enthusiastically raised might not have seen Apparitions as well as other Men as when with a Scalded Imagination he cry's out  Quô me Bachae raptis tui  Plenum quo nemora  Cam l    Ode    aut quos agor in specus  Velox mente novâ  Cruquius  has writ a Learned Comment on the former  Ode  of  Horace  which I recommend to the Curious Readers perusal he there reflects on  Lambinus  who in his Comment on the same  Ode  says  Credat Judaeus Apella  Non Ego  he not having duly examined the Scope of that Divine Poet in that  Ode    Having aver'd my own Experience in seeing  Genii  or  Spirits  I shall conclude this Chapter with what the most Ingenious Poet says of himself in the like case  Facta canam sed erunt qui me finxisse loquantur  Nullá{que} mortali numina visa putuent  Est Deus in nobis agitante calessimus illo  Impetus hic Sacrae semina mentis habet  Fas mihi praecipuè vultus vidisse Deorum  Fast    Vel quia sum vates vel quia Sacra cano  They're Facts I'll Sing tho' some may say I feign  And think no Gods were ever seen by Man  God Reigns in us by's Actings we take Fire  Such Salleys Seeds of Sacred Mind Inspire  Of all Men I may freely Gods behold  Or cause I'm Prophet or Gods Truths Unfold  CHAP V What perception Men have had of  Genii  or  Spirits  and their Operations by the Sense of Hearing  THyraeus  tells us  L de Appar Dei voc c    That God proposed to Himself in his way of acting with Men First to render Himself Familiar to them afterwards in succeeding Times to remit somewhat of His Familiarity at last to Govern Men not by Himself but by Men  The most familiar way that God has manifested Himself to Men has been by presenting Himself in an outward appearance and speaking to Men in an Humane Shape He came somewhat short of this when he was only heard and not seen It's Inferior to both when he was neither seen nor heard but insinuated Himself in a Dream or the Fancy the lowest degree was when he occupied only the understanding of Man  If we run over and examine all Gods manifestations of Himself we shall find for the most part that to the first Men God oftenest presented himself in an outward humane Form Afterwards That with later Men he had Discourses hiding his external Form  Thirdly  That he was neither seen in a personal Shape nor his Voice perceiv'd but he accomplish'd many things in Dreams  Fourthly  That he enlighten'd the Mind yet it must no be thought  that God so nicely o  rv'd this Rule that he never pass'd it by for when he has appear'd in an outward Form he has often also been heard often appear'd in Dreams often enlighten'd the Understanding Again in later Times also sometimes He has been seen sometimes heard but I relate what has happen'd for the most part  The Minds of Men being at length practis'd He afforded them his Presence partly by  Oracles  which he gave  Vivâ Voce  partly the Understanding being enlighten'd by Himself and the Ministry of Angels He in a manner withdrew Himself and govern'd Men by Men as His Deputies and left them in a manner to themselves as He now Governs them So far  Thyraeus    I have premitted this from  Thyraeus  to give a general Notion of the Manifestations of God and the Intellectual World to Man This Doctrine being strongly back'd by the Scriptures and deliver'd down to us from all Ages as likewise that  Genii Spirits Angels  and  Daemons  have manifested themselves to Man after the like manners  Appar Dei visib c    Now  Thyraeus  tells us farther That as these Manifestations differ in excellency according to the dignity of the Powers they are made to and each Power has its Dignity according as it is abstracted from Matter so the Sight in this regard exceeding the Hearing the Imagination the Sight the Understanding the Imagination the most excellent Manifestation will be the Intellectual next the Imaginary then the Visible and in the last place the Vocal  As I pretend to consider chiefly these two last ways and have already giv'n Accounts in reference to the  Sense of Seeing  I shall here give Instances of what perception Men have had of  Genii  or Spirits by the  Sense of Hearing  the manifestation of  Socrates  's  Genius  beforemention'd being by a Voice and many having heard strange Voices or Noises who have never seen any thing And as to these Voices or Noises heard we must consider them in a twofold respect Either only the Person concern'd hears them and not others present at the same time as it was the Case of  Socrates  or they are heard by all Persons present I shall therefore first give a few Instances of the latter and then of the others only noting by the by what  Wierus  says of these Voices or Noises  viz  De Praef Daem l    c    Spirits appear sometimes invisibly so that only a Sound or Voice or Noise is perceiv'd by Men  viz  a Stroke or Knocking or Whistling or Sneezing or Groaning or Lamenting or clapping of the Hands to make Men attend to Enquire or Answer  So far  Wierus    In  Luther  's  Colloquia Mensalia    Tom    c de Spectris    c set forth in  Latin  at  Francfort An  it being a different Collection from that of  Aurifaber  which is translated from the  HighDutch  into  English  we have the following Relation  It happen'd in  Prussia  that as a certain Boy was Born there presently came to him a  Genius  or what you please to call it for I leave it to Mens Judgments who had so faithful a care of the Infant that there was no need either of Mother or Servant and as he grew up he had a like care of him He went to School with him but so that he could never  be seen either by himself or any other in all his Life Afterwards he travelled into  Italy  he accompanyed him and whensoever any Evil was like to happen to him either on the Road or in the Inn he was perceived to foretel it by some touch or stroke he drew off his Boots as a Servant if he turn'd his Journey another way he continued with him having the same care of him in foretelling Evil at length he was made a  Canon  and as on a time he was sitting and feasting with his Friends in much Jolity a vehement Stroke was struck on a sudden on the Table so that they were all terrified presently the  Canon  said to his Friends be not afraid some great Evil hangs over my Head the next Day he fell into a Fever and the Fit continued on him for three whole Days till he died Miserably  Daemon l    c    The Second Instance I shall give is from  Bodin  which though it has been Printed in  English  already yet it relating to the Point I am treating of and containing many pertinent Instances I have thought fit to insert it here He writes therefore as follows  I can assure you a Person now living has told me he had a Spirit Daily attending him and that he began to have knowledge of him about the th Year of his Age though he believ'd he had accompanyed him all his Life by preceding Dreams and Visions he had to keep him from Vices and Inconvenicies but he never sensibly perceived him as he had done since his th Year which happen'd to him he says having for a Year before continually pray'd to God heartily Morning and Evening that he would please to send  him a  Good Angel  to guide him in all his Actions Since as he told me he begun to have very Instructive Dreams and Visions sometimes for him to Correct one Vice sometimes another sometimes for keeping himself from Danger sometimes for resolving him of one Difficulty sometimes of another and this not only concerning Divine but likewise Humane things Among others he seem'd to hear a Voice of God in his sleep saying to him  I will save thy Soul It is I that appear'd to thee before  since that every Morning about Three or Four of the Clock the Spirit knock'd at his Door and he rose sometimes and open'd his Door but saw no Body and every Morning the Spirit continued and if he did not rise he knock'd again and kept him waking till he rose then he began to be afraid thinking it some Evil Spirit as he said and therefore continued to Pray to God without failing a Day that he would send him a  Good Angel  and often sung the  Psalms  which he could say in a manner all by heart and then the Spirit made himself known to him as he was awake striking softly the first Day so that he sensibly perceiv'd many strokes on a Glass Viol which very much amaz'd him and two Days after having a Friend of his the King's Secretary who is still living dining with him the Secretary heard the Spirit strike after that manner on a little Stool standing by him whereupon he begun to look Red and to fear but he said to him be not afraid it's nothing however to give him an assurance he related to him the Truth of the Fact now he has assur'd me that since the Spirit has always  Accompanyed him giving him a sensible sign as touching him sometimes by the right Ear if he did somewhat that was not Good and by his left Ear if he did Well and if any one came to deceive and surprise him he presently perceiv'd the sign at his right Ear and if it were some good Man and came for his Good he perceiv'd also the sign at his left Ear and if he were about to Eat or Drink any thing that was Evil he perceiv'd the sign if he doubted of doing or undertaking something the signal happen'd to him If he thought of some Evil thing and was at a stand he presently perceiv'd the sign to put him off from it Sometimes when he began to Praise God with some  Psalm  or to speak of his Wonders he found himself seized with a certain Spiritual force which gave him Courage And for him to discern a Dream by Inspiration from those idle Fancies that happen when a Person is indispos'd or troubled in Mind he was awak'd by the Spirit about Two or Three of the Clock in the Morning and falling asleep a little after he had true Dreams of what he ought to do or believe or of doubts he had or of what would happen to him so that since that time he says there is scarce a thing that has happen'd to him but he has had an Advertisement of it nor a doubt of things that he ought to believe but he has had it resolv'd he duly Praying to God to teach him his Will Law and Truth and as for his Comportment otherwise he was of a Joyous Disposition enough in all his Actions and of a Gay Spirit alledging to this purpose that Passage of the Scripture which says  I saw the Countenances  of the Angels joyful  If he chanc'd in Company to say some Evil word or forbore some Days to Pray to God he was presently advertiz'd in his Sleep If he read in a Book that was not Good the Spirit struck on the Book to make him leave off and he was assoon directed if he did any thing against his Health and was carefully guarded in his Sickness In short he has told me so many Particulars that it would be endless to relate them all but above all he was advertis'd to rise in the Morning and commonly about Four of the Clock and says he heard a Voice in his sleep which said  Who is it that will rise first to serve God  He says also he was often advertis'd to give Alms and the more Alms he gave the more he found his Affairs to prosper and as his Enemies had resolved to kill him knowing that he was to go by Water he had a Vision in his Dream that his Father brought him two Horses one Red and the other White which made him send to hire two Horses and his Man brought him two Horses one Red and the other White he having not told him of what Colour he would have them I ask'd him why he spoke not openly to the Spirit he answer'd me that he once pray'd him to speak to him but presently the Spirit struck with violence against the Door as though it had been with an Hammer giving him to Understand that he took no Pleasure in it and often he put him by of reading and writing that he might give rest to his Mind and Meditate alone he hearing often a very subtle and inarticulate Voice I ask'd him if he had never seen the Spirit in a Form he told me he had never seen any thing waking unless  it were a sort of a Light in a round Form and very clear  I omit some other Immaterial Particulars concerning this Person in  Bodin  who concludes his Relation of him thus  I was willing to relate what I have known from such a Person to let Men understand that an Association with Evil Spirits ought not to be look'd upon as strange if Angels and Good Spirits have such a Society and Intelligence with Men But as for what he says that the Good Angel touch'd his Ear this is well noted in the Book of  Job  chap and in  Isaiah  chap where he says  Dominus vellicarit mihi aurem diluculo  and  Job  says it better yet discovering to understanding Men the Secret by which God by little and little makes himself sensibly known and as for what he says he heard striking with an Hammer we read it was the first Mark of the Prophets for in the Book of  Judges  it's said of  M  noa  that the Angel of God began to knock before him as  Rabbi David  says where the  Hebrew  word  Lepaghamo  signifies to knock and to sound ring or ting from the word  Pah  mon  which signifies a little Bell or Tabrette  c  So far  Bodin    Mr  Baxter  in his  Historical Discourse of Apparitions and Witches  writes thus There is now in  London  an Understanding Sober Pious Man oft one of my Hearers who has an Elder Brother a Gentleman of considerable Rank who having formerly seem'd Pious of late Years does often fall into the Sin of Drunkenness he often Lodges long together here in his Brother's House and whensoever he is Drunk and has slept himself Sober something Knocks at his Bed's Head as if one  knock'd on a Wainscot When they remove his Bed it follows him Beside other loud Noises on other Parts where he is that all the House hears they have often watch'd him and kept his Hands lest he should do it himself his Brother has often told it me and brought his Wife a discreet Woman to attest it who averrs morever that as she watch'd him she has seen his Shooes under the Bed taken up and nothing visible touch them They brought the Man himself to me and when we ask'd him how he dare Sin again after such a warning he has no Excuse but being Persons of Quality for some special Reason of Worldly Interest I must not Name him Two things are Remarkable in this Instance What a Powerful thing Temptation and Fleshly Concupiscence is and what an harden'd Heart Sin brings Men to if one rose from the Dead to warn such Sinners it would not of it self perswade them  It Poses me to think what kind of Spirit this is that has such a care of this Man's Soul which makes me hope he will recover Do good Spirits dwell so near us or Are they sent on such Messages or Is it his  Guardian Angel  or Is it the Soul of some Dead Friend that suffers and yet retaining Love to him as  Dives  to his Brethren would have him saved God yet keeps such things from us in the Dark The same Author in his said Book has inserted a Relation sent him by a Gentleman in a Letter concerning strange Noises as fol+lows  Mr  Harlakenden  who liv'd at  Coln Priory  in  Essex  where I often was his Son being my Pupil formerly the House of the  Earls  of  Oxford    off from the House was a TombHouse with a Chamber over it his Butler  Robert Crow  and  William  his Coachman us'd to lie in that Room at two of the Clock in the Morning there was always the sound of a great Bell tolling they affirming it so Mr  Harlakenden  slept in the Evening so as to be awak'd at one of the Clock and lay betwixt his two Servants to satisfie himself at two of the Clock comes the usual sound of a great Bell tolling which put him into a fright and sweat so as he jog'd his Servants who awaking said Hark  Tom  is at his Sport It reviv'd him to hear them speak Upon a particular occasion Mr  Thomas Shepherd  who afterwards went to  NewEngland  with some other Ministers and good People spent a Night in Prayer and had some respect to the place serving God to cast out the Devil and from that time never was any such Noise heard in the Chamber This I had from Mr  Harlakenden  's own Mouth and his Servants ear Witnesses when I was upon the place  So far this Account  Another Relation in this kind I have sent me in a Letter by an Ingenious and Learned ClergyMan of  Wilts  ire  who had given me the Relation before by word of Mouth It is as follows  Near Eighty Years since in the Parish of  Wilcot  which is by the  Devizes  in the Vicar'sHouse there was heard for a considerable time the sound of a Bell constantly tolling every Night the occasion was this a Debauch'd Person who liv'd in the Parish came one Night very late and demanded the Keys of the Church of the Vicar that he might  ring a Peal which the Vicar refus'd to let him have alledging the unseasonableness of the time and that he should by granting his desires give a disturbance to Sir  George Wroughton  and his Family whose House adjoyn'd to the ChurchYard Upon this refusal the Fellow went away in a Rage threatning to be reveng'd of the Vicar and going sometime after to the  Devizes  met with one  Cantle  or  Cantlow  a Person noted in those Days for a Wizard and he tells him how the Vicar had serv'd him and begs his help to be even with him The reply  Cantel  made him was this Does he not Love Ringing He shall have enough of it And from that time a Bell began to toll in his House and continued so to do till  Cantel  's Death who confess'd at  Fisherton Goal  in  Sarum  where he was confin'd by King  James  during his Life that he caus'd that sound and that it should be heard in that place during his Life The thing was so Notorious that Persons came from all Parts to hear it And  King James  sent a Gentleman from  London  on purpose to give him satisfaction concerning the truth of the Report  This Relation I had from  Francis Wroughton  Esq  Sir  George  's Son who liv'd more than Ninety Years he never heard the sound of the Bell being abroad at School but he has heard it averr'd to be true by all the Neighbours of repute and particularly often by his Father who was at no small Expence in Entertaining Strangers whose curiosity led them thither I have only this Circumstance to add That the sound was heard only by those who were in the House nay if any one put his Head out of the Window he could not hear the sound  which yet they at the same time did who were in the Room  The Gentleman's Name who sent me this Relation is  Wroughton  and is of Sir  George  's Family  Beda  treating of the  Seven Wonders of the World  tells us That in the  Capital  at  Rome  there were Statues set up for all the Provinces Conquer'd by the  Romans  or Images of their Gods and that on the Breasts of the Statues the Names of the Nations were written and little Bells were hung about their Necks and Priests were appointed to attend there Successively Day and Night to guard those Statues and to observe them with great Attention whether any of them mov'd and caus'd the little Bell to ring by which they knew what Nation was about to rebel against the  Romans  of which the Priests gave the  Roman  Princes Notice who presently provided for things accordingly  Angelus Rocca l de Campan c  tells us of many Bells that were wont to sound before Persons Deaths of their own accord Accounts of the like Nature having been given us by other Writers And Monsieur  de L'Ancre  in his Book intitl'd  Of the Inconstancy of Daemons and evil Spirits  tells us That in the Town of  Bourdeaux  there was an honest  Canon  of a Church who had his House for some time troubl'd with Spirits and that among other things there was heard almost every Night a kind of Musick like that of an  Espinette  set with certain  little Bells  so Pleasant that this partly took from him the fear and apprehension of the Spirits  Kircher  in his  Obeliseus Pamphilius  p tells  us The  Aegyptians  thought that by the sound of the  Sistrum  their Priests were variously inspir'd for performing Works of Divination which  Jamblicus  well explains saying  Various kinds of Motions in the World answer to various Orders of the Gods and certain kinds to certain of them now from these various Melodies flow which likewise agree each by their Motions to certain Gods in Order the Principles of those Motions These being every where bestow their Gifts chiefly to those that belong to them are chiefly present to Sounds and Melodies that chiefly agree to them and insinuating themselves into our Spirits affected with them they possess the Man and presently wholly Work in him by their Essence and Power  I shall conclude this Chapter with a Relation somewhat in this kind from  Paracelsus  tho' how far Spirits may be concern'd in the Matter I shall not determine  He begins the Sixth Book of his  Archidoxes  thus No Man can deny but Compositions of Metals may Work wonderful things in Supernaturals which may be made good by many Proofs as I shall clearly shew beneath for if you Compound all the Seven Metals in a due Order and fit time and melt them together as it were into one Mass you will have such a Metal in which all the Virtues of the Seven Planets are joyn'd together you will find all these Virtues in that one Metal which we call  Electrum  And beneath he writes you must know that  our Electrum  which is Compounded of the Seven Metals drives away all evil Spirits for in our  Electrum  the Operation of the Heav'ns and Influences of the Seven  Planets are stor'd up Therefore the Ancient  Persian Magi  and the  Chaldaeans  found out and perform'd many things by its means I cannot here conceal a very great Miracle which I saw wrought by a  Spanish Nercromancer  who had a Bell not exceeding two Pounds Weight which as often as he rung he could cause to appear about him many Spirits and  Spectres  of various Kinds for when he pleas'd he drew some Words and Characters on the inward surface of the Bell and afterwards if he rung it a Spirit presently appear'd in any Form he would have him By the sound also of the said Bell he could draw to him also or drive from him many other Visions and Spirits and even Men and Beasts as I saw with my Eyes many of these things done by him But as often as he would undertake some New thing so often he renewed his Words and Characters but he would not reveal to me the Secret of these Words and Characters though deeply considering the thing my self I at length casually found it which I shall not here disclose but I plainly enough observ'd there was more Importance in the Bell than in the Words for the Bell was certainly made of our  Electrum  So far  Paracelsus    I may here note That some Persons have told my self that they have seen a constellated Plate here in  London  made of such  Electrum  which if put under a Man's Pillow at Night will make him hear Heavenly Musick  CHAP VI What perception some Persons have had of  Genii  or  Spirits  and their Operations by the Sense of Hearing when others present have heard nothing  THO' as  Ludovicus Vives  says  L de Anim c de Cogn Inter  Good and Evil Spirits have certain Actions unknown to us as Men have among themselves which Brutes understand not for as Men move each others Fancies and Minds by Words Nods Gestures Letters or Signs which surpass the Knowledge of Brutes so Spiritual Essences may agitate our Fancy by some Action proper and known only to themselves the Imaginative faculty first mov'd yet we do not ascribe all strange things wrought by the Fancy to the Operation of Spirits for as the same Author says some by the meer Action of the Fancy seem to have got themselves posted in a state of great Happiness as we find of him in  Horace    fuit haud Ignobilis Argis  Qui se credebat miros audire Tragaedos  In vacuo Laetus sessor plausor{que} Theatro  Caetera dum vitae servaret munia recto  More bonus sane vicinus ambailis hospes  Comis in vxorem posset qui Ignoscere servis  Et signo laeso non insanire Lagenae  Posset qui rupem puteum vitar  patentem  Hic ubi

gratissimus error  Nimirum sapere est abjectis utile nugis  Epist l    Ep    Et tempestivum pueris concedere ludum  a Gentleman of Greece  Thought he heard Acted wondrous Tragedies  And sate and clapt them at an open Stage  In all things else comporting him as sage  Good Neighbour truly hospitable Friend  Kind to his Wife if Servants did offend  Would easily Pardon not o're stirr'd to Wrath  Could shun a Rock and Precipice in his Path  This Man by charge and care of Friends being cur'd  His Sense with Helebore and good Wine restor'd  When come t' himself cry'd Friends you've kill'd m' outright  Not saved me thus extorting my delight  And robbing m' of my minds delusive Joys  It's good to please us thus with abject toys  And in fit time to allow their sport to Boys  This Instance we find relates to the Sense of Hearing  Horace  saying he heard Actors when only the Person concern'd Hears though we may probably judge he saw the Actors as well as heard them So  Galen  tells us of a certain Physician  L de Symp diff c    nam'd  Theophilus  who being ill of a Fever heard Musical Instruments continually playing in his Chamber and being recover'd persisted still to affirm the thing real  Cent    Hist    So  Bartholin  tells us of a Student of a Melancholick  Complexion and distracted with Grief for the Death of a Sister who said he heard a Celestial kind of Musick  We know its said of  Pythagoras  and  Apollonius Tyanaeus  That they heard the Harmony of the Spheres which tho' some interpret otherwise I know not why it may not be thought they heard some Celestial Harmony this having hapned to several Persons beside themselves An Ancient contemplative Gent now living in  London  has told me That for Forty Years past he had never retired to Contemplation as he daily did but he heard an Heavenly Musick And I know many others who have often heard the same as I must declare I have often heard it my self tho' other Persons present with us at the same time hear it not as we do  Delrio  and  Torreblanca  write  Disq mag l    quest    Sect    L de Mag operat c    That the Hearing being vitiated is wont to deceive us as it happens in Persons troubled with the  Morbus Imaginosus  of which Distemper Learned Men make two kinds one more commonly call'd a  Frensy  when Phantasms are represented to the Mind in  visible Species  Concerning which kind you may cousult  Cornelius Celsus  and  Claelius Aurelianus  and this belongs to the depravation of the Fancy the other kind is called  Corybantiasmus  which takes Sleep from the Sight and vitiates the Ears whereby Men seem to hear Ringings and Sounds  Concerning this Disease  Scaliger  writes thus  Corybantiasmus  is a Disease of the Imagination  In C  tuli▪  which superstitious Antiquity believ'd to be sent by the  Corybantes  It seem'd to the Persons affected with it that their  ars were always filled with a Noise of Musick and Singing those who labour under this Disease are troubled  with Watchings or want of Sleep or at least with a light Sleep having their Eyes open for they have always their Minds intent on Images whence those that Sleep with their Eyes open were said to act like the  Corybantes  such having no sound Sleep by reason of Images and Sounds So  Varro  in  Prometheo Satyr    Levisomna mens sonorinas Imagines  Affatur non umbraentur somno pupilla  To this relates that Passage of  Plautus  in some Comedy of his the name of which is still in question  Mecum habet Patagus aes morbus  L    c    Which passage in the Notes set forth by  Gronovius  on  Macrobius  is referr'd to the  Corybantes  or Priests of  Cybele Patagus  denoting the shaking of their Heads  Aes  the confus'd sound of Brass Whence is that of the Poet  Nec te progenitum Cybeleius aere so  oro  Lustravit Corybas  The Disease it self is called  Corybantiasmus  To this  Claudian  seems to have alluded  L    in Ruff  Impatiens{que} sui Morbus  And  Lucretius    Sollicitae porro plenaeque sonoribus aures  The word  Patagus  comes from    cum Strepitu palpito Item Percutio ferio  For when the  Corybantes  were raised in a Fury they shak'd their Heads Danc'd and run against each  each other striking their Brass Bucklers and causing a ringing of Brass not without a Rhythmical Composition of the  Dactyle Foot  from which Foot and Mount  Ida  they were called  Dactyli Idaei    Now tho' there be such a Disease causing Musical Sounds in the Ear this cannot rationally be imputed to  Pythagoras Apollonius  or the Gentleman I before mentioned and others they not being troubled with want of Sleep or short disturbed Sleep nor Sleeping with their Eyes open which are set forth as Symptoms of it  To proceed to give an account of a perception of other Sounds by the Hearing which by some are imputed to Spirits by others to other Causes we find among the superstitious observations of the  Gentiles  if any Person had a Ringing in his Ears it was taken as an Omen and as  Pliny  says  L    c    it was usual for Persons absent to perceive that others were talking of them by a Ringing in the Ear and to this purpose there is an Elegant  Latin Epigram  writ by a very ancient  Poet  and first made publick by  Joseph Scalliger  as he says  C  ▪  in his Notes on  Ausonius  Garrula quid totis resonas mihi noctibus auris  Nescio quem dicunt nunc meminisse mei  Hic quis sit quaeris resonant tibi noctibus aures  Et resonunt totis Delia te loquitur  Non dubié loquitur me Delia mollior aura  Venit exili murmure dulcè fremit  Delia non aliter secreta silentia noctis  Summissa ac tenui rumpere voce solet  Why ring al' night my pratling Ear they say  I know not who is talking now of me  Would you know who your ear all night does sound  All night It's  Delia  's Voice there does rebound  It's surely  Delia  talks of me a noise  Comes soft and gently with sweet murmuring voice  Ev'n as my  Delia  with soft voice delights  To break the secret Silence of the Nights  Var hist l    c    And as  Aelian  tells us  Pythagoras  thought somewhat Divine lay hid in these Ringings he saying the sound which very often happens in the Ears is the Voice of the  Gods  or  Daemons    As for the way that Men perceive these Sounds and Voices  Sect Antiq l    c    Rhodiginus  tells us that  Socrates  perceived his Spirit by Sense not by the Sense of his Body but as the  Platonicks  were fully perswaded by the Sense of the Aetheastreal Body lying hid within us after which way also  Avicenna  thought Angels were wont to be seen and heard by the Prophets for the words of  Daemons  pass every where  L de Daem Socret  as  Plutarch  says but their sound is only heard by those that keep their Minds in a calm and composed State undisturbed by Passions whom we call Sacred and Demonial Men unless we had rather explain  Socrates  's perception of his  Daemon    In Alcib Plat  according to  Proclus  as follows The Voice did not come to  Socrates  passively from without but an Inspiration of his  Daemon  from within proceeding throughout the whole Soul and passing to the Organs of the Senses a Voice at length manifested it self as coming to knowledge not so much by Sense as by Consent for such illustrations are wont to happen from good  Daemons  and the  Gods  Whence  Maximus Tyrius  says You wonder  Sacrates  came to a familiarity with a  Daemon    who was as a friendly Prophet to him and continually so attended him that he seem'd as it were Interwoven with his Mind  So  Piccolomeni  says  L de  Soc  L de Rero vel c Daemon  Socrates  heard the voice of his  Daemon  not with the Ear of his Body but of his Mind wherefore others did not Hear it for it was an internal representation of the Voice to the common Sense and Fancy  James Gohory  also who took on him the Name of  Leo Suavius  in his Comment on a Passage in  Paracelsus l    de vita longa c  tells us of a sound that is made by the Powder of Projection in the Transmutation of Metals which I think is to be taken in a Spiritual Sense of which sound he says the mystical Books of the  Spagyrists  make mention as  Augurellus    Indicio est etiam sonus hinc obtusus aure  Deprehendi haud facilis  He adds The Author of  The dangerous Fountain  says There is made a certain Melody which sometimes ceases as it were by the Magick Art And elsewhere the wonderful sound of a strange Bell strikes my Ear And  Paracelsus  himself says  L de vit long c    Tympana{que} nobis Anonididica reddunt  by the word  Anonididica  meaning gentle Anodine Sounds composing the Mind  Cardan  writes thus  De Rer var l    c    Not only in all Sneezings but in other kinds of Presagings there are these things to be observed First that it be no natural thing but something differing from the natural as it was in that Ringing wherewith I was admonish'd for many Years of any Fame or Rumour concerning me for  this was not like to a Morbous affect which now I have sometimes experience of for this is inward and as it were fix'd and troublesome Light and coming from without and as it were separate moreover it shakes my whole Head as tho' it would compel me to take notice of it a wonderful thing truly and almost Incredible and it's known chiefly from this that it's Familiar and in a manner always happens when I am upon some business of concern nor does it happen in Diseases So far  Cardan  We know the causes of common Ringings in the Ear  Schol Salern  Motus longa fames vomitus percussio casus  Ebrietas Frigus tinnitum causat in aure  But these Ringings  Cardan  speaks of are of another nature of which I have had a woderful experience my self tho' I may not express it as  Luther  does  C    who in his  Table Talk  tells us that  An  he was at  Coburg  where he was plagu'd in such sort with a sounding and ringing in his Ears that it was as if a Wind went out of his Head  C    the Devil driving it  Ricoldus  in his confutation of the Law given by  Mahomet  to the  Saracens  writes thus  Mahomet  being troubled with the Falling Sickness a Disease incident to Great Men as  Aristotle  observes in  Socrates Callimachus  and  Hercules    In Prob  to whom we may add  Scotus  and many others least others should think him really troubled with it still as he fell down in his Trances say'd that an  Angel  Convers'd with him and gave him certain Answers with the sound of a Bell in his Ear  Instar Campanae auribuscrcumsonantis    Now as for hearing sounds of Bells I never heard of any Person who has had so much experience in that kind as my self tho' I know one Person and have been well inform'd of others who have sometimes heard the Sounds of Bells after the same manner But in two Spiritual Visitations that have happen'd to me some Years distance the one from the other of which I may give some account in this Book I have heard Bells for several Weeks together and that of all sorts from the greatest Church Bells to a little Hawk's Bell Sometimes I have heard a Church Bell gently Tolling sometimes Bells Ringing in Peal Solemnly as at a Funeral sometimes Merry round Ringing as at Weddings For some Weeks together every Night as soon as I was in Bed a Spirit came with a little Bell Ringing in my Ear and a Voice always Talking to me and many other varieties I have had in that kind and that both by Day and by Night tho' no Person present with me at the same time has heard any thing as they told me upon my enquiry of them I have heard every Night for some time Hundreds of Spirits coming as it seem'd to me first at a great distance Singing and Ringing hand Bells who gradually approach'd my House the Sound seeming nearer and nearer till at length they came to my Chamber Windows and some would come into my Chamber The first Ringing Sound I heard was of a Bell gently Tolling at one of my Chamber Windows which looks to the  South  and at the same time at the same Window I heard a Spirit striking gentle strokes with a small Rod as it seem'd to me on a Brass Pan or Bason  tuning his strokes to a call he us'd  Come away to me Come away to me  and just upon it another Spirit at another of my Chamber Windows which look'd to the  East  called to me in a louder and earnest Tone  Come away to me Come away to me  I shall here forbear any farther particular Account in this kind as to my own Experience and shall set down somewhat relating to what is said before as to Ringing of Bells and Brass practised by the Ancient  Gentiles    L de camp c    Fast l    Angelus Rocca  tells us It was believed by the  Gentiles  that the  Manes  or rather  Daemons  were driven away by the ringing of Brass or Bells as it appears from  Ovid  where he says of the  Ghosts  or  Manes    Rursus aquam tangit Temesaeá{que} concrepat aera  Et rogat ut tectis exeat umbra suis  Cum dixit novies manes exite paterni  Respicit purè Sacra peracta putat  Again he washes rings Tempsaean Brass  And prays the Manes from his House to pass  Then Nine times Cries Paternal Ghosts be gone  So looks about thinks Sacred Rites are done  Therefore the  Gentiles  thought that by the sound of Bells Evil or offensive  Genii  were driven away or restrained from giving disturbance because the  Manes  as  Hieronymus Magius  says were thought to love  Silence  Whence by the  Poets  they were called  Silentes  as  Ovid  says in the same Book  Mox etiam l  mures animas dixere silentum  Wherefore as often as such Ghosts have spoken they are said to have us'd rather a low and muttering Voice than a clear one as  Ovid  says  Ib  Umbra cruenta Remi visa est assistere lecto  At{que} haec exiguo murmure visa loqui  Remus his Bloody Ghost stood by the Bed  And with low murmur these words uttered  In reference to this  Remigius  writes concerning such as were accus'd of Witchcraft  Daemona latr l    c    and converse with evil Spirits as follows  Nicolaea Granatia Eva Hesoletia Jananigra Armacuriana  and many others say the Spirits have such a Voice as one that puts his Head in an Empty Hogshead or craz'd Vessel and therefore always in speaking hold their Heads downwards as Persons asham'd or self conscious of some Crime are wont to do or at least they have a small and weak Voice So  Hermolaus Barbarus  said he heard a Voice of an hissing  Daemon  as he answer'd himself and  Georgius Placentinus  asking him concerning the meaning of  Aristotle  's  Entelechia  The  Elm  also mention'd in  Philostratus  that is as I conceive the  Daemon  of  Thespion  speaking from the  Elm  by his command who was the Eldest of the  Gymnosophists  saluted  Apollonius  coming to them with a  Slender Voice  The  Lecanomancy  also of the  Assyrians  and  Chaldaeans  was wont to effect this that the  Daemons  deliver'd their Words from the Bason with a stridulous and low hissing So far  Remigius    L    c    ità  ori    To this I may add what  Le Loyer  writes in in his History of Spectres  viz Damascius  a  Pagan  Philosopher relates that the  Familiar Spirits  lying hid in round consecrated Bowls which he calls  Betyles  answer'd those that consulted them in a small and Inarticulate Voice that it seem'd rather an hissing than a Speech and had need of Interpreters The name  Betyl  s  is  Syriack  and was taken from the  Hebrews  who call'd those Places  Bethel  where the Patriarch  Jacob  plac'd Stones for a Mark that he had there ador'd God the  Syrians  turn'd this to their Superstition and call'd  Betyles  their  anim  ted Stones  or Stones in which a  God  or  Daemon  was hid Our Learned  Selden  writes of those  Betyles L de Diis Syris    But to pass by other Relations in this kind and to speak of my own Experience some Spirits that convers'd with me for some Months together had a  Lowsunk Voice  as many Persons have in Colds but it was without any Hoarseness being very clearly discernable the Spirits I heard coming to me singing in the Evenings had clear Voices and that Spirit which came Nightly to me for some time with a Bell in my Ear had a very clear and resonant Voice  Br  ss  and its ringing were also us'd by the  Gentiles  on several other Accounts and that for the same Reason  viz  It's purifying Nature  L      c    concerning which  Cael Rhodig  writes thus The Interpreter of  Theocritus  in the Poet's  Ph  rm  c  utria  writes that Brass was thought by the Ancients to be of great Virtue in  S  cred Rites  and Excantations and therefore was wont to be us'd in  Eclipses  of the Mo  n and at Mens Deaths because it was  thought more pure than other things and expiatory of Pollutions therefore they us'd it in all Purifications as  Apollodorus  has writ  l de Diis  And  Sophocles  in his  Tragedy  which is call'd  Rhizotomi  that is  the Cutters of Roots  writes of  Medea  cutting Herbs with a brass Knife and putting the Juice into brass Vessels And  Macrobius  writes That brass Vessels were us'd chiefly in those  Sacred Rites  with which they would compose the Minds of Persons or consecrate them or Cure Diseases And the Priests of the  Sabines  were wont to have their Hair Cut with a Brass Knife and it's manifest that the most Ancient  Greeks  us'd in many things the sound of Brass as a most Powerful thing As for the Reason of the Ancients in giving aid to the Moon when in an  Eclipse  by a confus'd noise of Brass  Alexander  gives it us thus Men rung Iron and Brass because they thought  Daemons  were driven away by it at the time that the Planets cannot convey their Influence to the Earth which is for the Benefit of Men  Some tell us That by the ringing Noise of Brass the force of Magick Charms was hindred from reaching to the Moon the Charmers Voice being confounded by it and that by this means relief was thought to be giv'n the Moon when in a  Eclipse  for Brass is the most sonorous of all the Metals it having a shrill and penetrating sound whence  Homer  gave  Juno  the Epithet  and  Spondanus  on  Homer  thinks a most resonant Voice was aptly giv'n her because a Voice is nothing but the Air struck and by  Juno  is meant the Air  L de Tintin c    Magius  says the Searchers into Natural Causes think by the sound of Bells the violent injury of Tempests Winds and Hailstorms is driven away because such ringing greatly agitates cuts and breaks the Air which appears from hence that when Bees rise in a Swarm and begin to fly away they are forc'd to pitch again by a gentle ringing of Brass the Air being cut and sever'd and scarce bearing their flight though some think Bees then pitch upon the Air's being moved because they are delighted with the ringing which I leave to the judgment of others  L de Diis  Apollodorus  says the Priest of  Proserpina  was wont to ring a little Bell in her Sacred Ceremonies and the Priest of the  Syrian Goddess  also was wont to use a little Bell  L de Dea Syria  as  Lucian  writes The Priest after he is come to the uppermost part of the Temple Prays for the whole Congregation and in praying he also rings a certain little Bell  Robertellus  also in  Octavian Augustus  gives testimony of this Custom when he speaks of the Gates and tops of Temples  L    The top is compass'd about with Bells the Bells were wont to hang for the most part over the Gates of Temples  Fungerus  in his  Etymologicum Trilinque  tells us the  Hebrew  word for  Aes  is  Necuschoh  or  Nechoscheth  from the word  Nachosoh  that is he made an Auguration he has Divin'd he has Ominated he has had certain Conjectures Some think the reason of the Name to be that haply from the sound of a ringing Bell some Observation was made in  Auguries Divinations  and the like Conjectures and  Gronovius  in his learned Exercitations on  Stephanus Byzantinus  's  Fragment de Dodo  tells us That because Oracles  and Divinations are denoted by the word  Nechosoh  which signifies also Brass and  Lebetes  hence in the  Dodonaean Oracle  Brass Bells  Lebetes  and  Tripods  were excogitated when only Oracles and Divinations were to be understood Mr  Rosse  in his View of the Religions of  Asia  will have it that the Bells hanging at the  Pallium  of the High Priest of the  Jews  denoted Christ's Prophetick Office though I know other Significations are ascrib'd to it by other Writers And  Plutarch In Symposi  introduces  Metagenes  an  Athenian  who as well for other Reasons there given as for the  Jews  High Priests wearing the said Bells which make a noise as he walks will have the God of the Jews to be the same with  Bacchus  because in their Country in the Nocturnal Sacrifices of  Bacchus  call'd  Nyctelia  they made a great noise and the Nurses of  Bacchus  were call'd  Chalcodristae  as much as to say  Scrapers of Brass  The strong Impression made on me by the noise of Bells in my Spiritual Visitations led me to draw these things together from the Ancients which I leave to the Readers Consideration  CHAP VII What perception Men have had of Spirits and their Operations by all their Senses  THO' the Senses of Seeing and Hearing are the chief Senses concern'd in a Perception of Spirits and their Operations yet the other Senses sometimes are some way affected by them For as St  Austin  says The Evil work of the Devil creeps through all the Passages of the Senses he presents himself in Figures applies himself to Colours adheres to Sounds introduces Odours infuses himself in Savours and fills all the Passages of Intelligence sometimes cruelly tormenting with Grief and Fear sometimes sportingly diverting Man or taunting with Mocks  According to this Passage of St  Austin  Mr  John Pordage  in his Book writ in vindication of himself from  Necromancy  c publish'd in  London An  After having set forth that his MaidServant  Elizabeth Benwel  had depos'd before the Commissioners that she had heard Musick in his House when she knew not that any Instruments or Musicians were in the House and that she had heard it in the Kitchen and in her Mistresses Closet and thought the same to be near her but saw none playing Which Fact Mr  Pordage  does not oppose And he there confessing that in  August  there appear'd in his BedChamber about the middle of the Night a Spirit in the shape of one  Everard  whom he suspected to be a Conjurer and to be instrumental in raising up those Apparitions which himself and others saw with his wearing Apparel Bands Cuffs Hat  c  who after his sudden drawing of the BedCurtains seem'd to walk once through the Chamber very easily and so disappear'd And that the same Night there appear'd to him a great Dragon which seem'd to take up most of a large Room having great Teeth and open Jaws whence he often ejected Fire against him which came with such a Magical Influence that it almost struck the Breath out of his Body and this Apparition continued 'till the Day began to dawn and then disappear'd I say having set forth this he proceeds to declare some extraordinary things which few had been made acquainted with and which at that time were seen and experimented by himself and others with him He writing as follows  Our inward spiritual Eyes being open'd in an extraordinary way two invisible internal Principles were laid open and discover'd to us which may be call'd  Mundi Ideales  being two spiritual Worlds which seem'd very much differing the one from the other as having contrary Qualities and Operations by which they work upon this visible Creation He says One of those internal Worlds may be call'd  Mundus tenebrosus  the dark World whose Objects by their correspondent inward Faculties or Senses were then discover'd and made known to them The other World he says may be call'd  Mundus  uminosus  or  the light World which with its various Objects was then likewise open'd to their inward Senses for beside their internal Sight they had their other internal spiritual Faculties of spiritual Sensation open'd to discern their various Objects within these Worlds  As to the Objects of the internal Sight when the dark Principle or World was open'd they beheld innumerable multitudes of evil  Spirits  or  Angels  presenting themselves in appearing distinctions of Order and Dignity The Princes of this dark World and their Subjects presented themselves as passing before their Eyes in Pomp and State all the mighty ones appearing to be drawn in dark aiery Clouds Chariots with Six or at least Four Beasts to each one beside every figure or similitude of a Coach was attended with many inferior Spirits as Servants to the Princes The Animals that drew the cloudy Coaches appear'd in the shapes of Lyons Dragons Elephants Tygers Bears and such like terrible Beasts Besides the Princes and those that attended them tho' all in the shapes of Men yet represented themselves monstrously mishapen and with Ears like those of Cats cloven Feet ugly Legs and Bodies Eyes fiery sharp and piercing Beside these appearances within the Spirits made some wonderful Impressions on Bodies without as Figures of Men and Beasts upon the GlassWindows and the Ceilings of the House some of which yet remain But what was most remarkable was the whole visible World represented by the Spirits upon the Bricks of the Chimney in the form of two half Globes as in Maps After which upon other Bricks of the same Chimney was figur'd  a Coach and four Horses with Persons in it and a Footman attending all seeming to be in motion with many other such Images which seem'd to be wonderful exactly done Now fearing lest there might be any danger in these Images through unknown Conjuration and false Magick we endeavour'd to wash them out with wet Cloaths but could not finding them engraven in the substance of the Bricks which indeed might have continued 'till this Day had not fear and suspicion of Witchcraft and some evil design of the Devil against us in it caus'd us to deface and obliterate them with Hammers  He adds beneath But to shut up this relation of the Objects we saw in this dark World I must add this that were but the Eyes of Men open to see the Kingdom of the Dragon in this World with the multitudes of evil Angels which are every where tempting and ensnaring Men they would be amaz'd and not dare to be by themselves without good Consciences and a great assurance of the Love and Favour of God in protecting them by the Ministration of the Holy Angels  As to the Objects of the inward and outward  Smell  he says That within three Weeks space in which these Wonders appear'd at several times the evil Angels or Spirits raised up such noisome poysonous Smells that both the inward and outward parts of those that were exercised with them became much di+sturbed and offended for through the Sympathy betwixt the Body and the Soul the sulphurous hellish Smells much exercised both by Magical Tincturation  In reference to the Objects of the  Taste  he says That sometimes both Night and Day they were exercis'd with the loathsome Hellish Tastes of Sulphur Brimstone Soot and Salt mingled together which were so loathsome to them that they were like to cause great Distempers and Nauseousness in their Bodies had they not been supported by God beyond their own strength  In Relation to their outward and inward  Touch  they were much exercised both in Body and Soul as to their Souls they sometimes felt such strange and Magical Wounds and piercings by the fiery Darts of the Devil that none can Express them but those that have been exercis'd in some Measure as  Job  was As to their Bodies they felt Material Impressions from the Powers of Darkness very noxious in themselves as to their Natural Spirits and Life but born by them by quiet Submission to the Will of God  As to the Internal  Light World  There appear'd then to their inward  Sight  multitudes almost innumerable of pure Angelical Spirits in Figurative Bodies which were clear as the Morning Star and transparent as Crystal sparkling like Diamonds and sending forth Beams like the Sun powerfully refreshing their Souls and enlivening their Bodies  In Relation to the inward Sense of  Hearing  there were many Musical Sounds and Voices like those that St  John  heard in  Mount Sion  the Sweetness Harmony and Pleasantness of which cannot be express'd nor that Spiritual Joy and Delight which by them was infus'd into their Souls be utter'd by the Tongue it ravishing their Spirits into the high Praises of  Jehovah    In Relation to the faculty of  Smelling  the Tongue can hardly express those Heavenly Odours and Perfumes which then were smelt piercing into the very Spirit beside the quickning Vertue which by them was Communicated and Insinuated into the Spirits of their outward Bodies which like a Cordial had been able to have renew'd the strength of their Languishing Nature  Their Sense or Faculty of  Tasting  was very Pleasantly entertain'd with those invisible Dews which were sweeter than Honey with which instead of Food they were many times wonderfully refresh'd  In Relation to the Sense of Spiritual  Contact  that was also delighted with its Heavenly Objects for he says none can utter those pleasing Impressions which the burning Tincture of the Light World afforded them coming like an hot Cordial into the Center of their Spirits being sensibly felt in the inner Parts so as to cause much Joy and Heavenly Pleasures which penetrated through their Souls and gave them occasion to Praise and Magnify God  Thus he says for the space of three Weeks or a Month they were exercised inwardly and outwardly through that great Combat that was betwixt those two Worlds and their Inhabitants the Dark World sometimes Afflicting them with dreadful Shapes abominable Smells loathsome Tasts with other Operations of the evil Angels the light World at other times opening and relieving them with Odoriferous Perfumes most sweet Dews Glorious Visions and Angelical Harmony He adds That now for the space of Years ever since the time of these great Manifestations they  have enjoy'd the exercise of their Spiritual Senses which were never since shut nor would be unless through Transgression and Disobedience they ran back into the earthly Nature  I have set down this Relation in short from Mr  Pordage  And as for the Truth of it it must rely upon him and the other Persons then concerned with him but for my self I have no Reason to Question the Truth of it it being usual with those that are train'd up to a contemplative Life to have Visitations in that kind both Internal and External  L    Part    c    The learned  Walter Hilton  a great Master of a contemplative Life in his  Scale of Perfection  sets forth that Appearances or Representations to the Corporeal Senses may be both Good and Evil Writing as follows  By what I have said you may somewhat understand that Visions or Revelations or any manner of Spirit in Bodily appearing or in imagining sleeping or waking or any other feeling in the Bodily Sense made as it were Spiritually either by sounding in the Ear or savouring in the Mouth or smelling at the Nose or else any sensible Heat as it were Fire glowing and warming the Breast or any other part of the Body or any other thing that may be felt by Bodily sense though it be never so comfortable and liking yet are they not contemplation it self but simple and secondary though they are good in respect of the Spiritual Vertues and of this Spiritual knowing and loving of God accompanying true contemplation but all such manner of feeling may be good wrought by a good  Angel  and they may be deceivable wrought by a  wicked  Angel  when he transfigures himself into an  Angel  of Light for the Devil may Counterfeit in Bodily feeling the likeness of the same things which a good  Angel  may Work for as a good  Angel  comes with Light so can the Devil and as he can do this in Matters of Seeing so can he do it in Matters of the other Senses he that has felt both can well tell which were good and which were evil but he that has never felt either or else but one of them may easily be deceived  These two are alike in the manner of feeling outwardly but they are very differing within and therefore they are not to be greatly desired nor to be entertain'd lightly unless a Soul can by the Spirit of Discretion know the good from the evil that it be not beguil'd as St  John  says  Trust not every Spirit      Joh    but try first whether it be of God or no  And to know whether the Representation to the Bodily senses be good or evil  Chap    Hilton  gives the following Rule  If you see any manner of Light or brightness with your Bodily Eye or in Imagination other than every Man sees or if you hear any wonderful pleasant sounding with your Ear or have in your Mouth any sweet sudden Savour other than what you know to be Natural or any heat in your Breast like Fire or any manner of Delight in any part of your Body or if a Spirit appear Bodily to you as it were an  Angel  to Comfort you or teach you or if any such feeling which you know well comes not from your self nor from any Bodily Creature beware at that time or presently upon it and wisely consider the stirrings of your Heart for if by Occasion of the pleasure  and liking you take in the said Feeling or Vision you see your Heart drawn from the minding and beholding of  Jesus Christ  and from Spiritual Exercises as from Prayer and thinking of your self and your defects or from the inward desire of Vertues and of Spiritual knowing and feeling of God to set the sight of your Heart and your Affection your Delight and your rest Principally on the said Feelings or Visions supposing that to be a part of Heavenly Joy or  Angels  Bliss and thereupon come to think that you should neither Pray nor think of any thing else but wholly attend thereto for to keep it and delight your self therein then is this Feeling very suspiscious to come from the Enemy and therefore though it be never so liking and wonderful refuse it and assent not thereto for this is a slight of the Enemy to let and beguile the Soul by such bodily Savours or Sweetness in the Senses to bring it into Spiritual Pride and into a False security of it self flattering it self that it had thereby a Feeling of Heavenly Joy and that it is half in  Paradise  by reason of the Delight it feels about it when indeed it's near to Hell Gates and so by Pride and Presumption it might fall into Errors or Heresies or Phantasms or other Bodily or Spiritual Mischiefs  But if it be so that this manner of Feeling lets not your Heart from Spiritual Exercises but makes you more devout and more fervent to Pray more wise to think Spiritual Thoughts and tho' it be so that it astonishes you in the  eginning nevertheless afterwards it turns and quickens your Heart to more desire of Vertues and encreases your Love more to God  and to your Neighbour also it makes you more humble in your own Eyes By these Tokens you may know it is of God wrought by the presence and working of a good Angel and comes from the goodness of God either for the comfort of simple devout Souls to increase their trust and desire towards God to seek thereby the knowing and loving of God more perfectly by means of such Comforts or else if they be Perfect that feel such delight it seems to them to be an earnest and as it were a shadow of the glorifying of the Body which it shall have in the Bliss of Heaven but I know not whether there be any such Men on the Earth  He goes on Of this way of discerning the working of Spirits speaks St  John  in his Epistle thus  John    Omnis spiritus qui solvit Jesum hic non est ex Deo Every Spirit that looses or unknits Jesus he is not of God  This knitting and fastning of  Jesus  to a Man's Soul is wrought by a good Will and a great desire to him only to have him and see him in his Bliss spiritually The greater this desire is the faster is  Jesus  knit to the Soul and the less this desire is the looser is he knit Whatsoever Spirit therefore or feeling it is which lessens this Desire and would draw it down from the stedfast minding of  Jesus Christ  and from the kindly breathing and aspiring up to him this Spirit will unkni  Jesus  from the Soul and therefore it is not of God but is the working of the Enemy But if a Spirit or a Feeling or a Revelation make this desire more knitting the knots of Love and Devotion faster to  Jesus  opening the Eyes of the Soul into spiritual knowing  more clearly and makes it more humble in it self this Spirit is of God  And hereby you may learn that you are not to suffer your Heart willingly to rest nor to delight wholly in any such bodily Feelings of such manner of Comforts or Sweetness tho' they were good but rather hold them in your sight nought or little in comparison of Spirital Desire and stedfast thinking of  Jesus  nor shall you fast'n the thought of your Heart overmuch on them  He goes on But you shall seek with great diligence in Prayer that you may come to a spiritual Feeling or Sight of God that is that you may know the Wisdom of God the endless Might of him his great Goodness in Himself and in his Creatures for this is Contemplation and that other mentioned is none Thus says St  Paul  being rooted and grounded in Charity  Ephes    we may be able to comprehend with all the Saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth That you may know he says not by sound of the Ear nor sweet savour in the Mouth nor by any such bodily thing but that you may know and feel with all Saints what is the length of the endless Being of God the breadth of the wonderful Charity and Goodness of God the height of His Almighty Majesty and the bottomless depth of His Wisdom In Knowing and spiritual Feeling of these should be the exercise of a Contemplative Man for in these may be understood the full knowing of all spiritual things  c  I have set down these things somewhat at large from this Author because I conceive they may be useful to some Men who lie under  spiritual Visitations of this kind We see he supposes it no uncommon thing for Men to have their Spiritual and Corporal Senses wrought on in this extraordinary way and teaches how they may discern Good from Bad in such cases I know the Contempt many Men have for Studies of this nature but its not to those I here write Nor is it every Man's Talent to be Master of a Contemplative Life This Person by a deep Inspection into the disposition of Mens Minds in all the gradations of a Contemplative Life had a clear view of the  Figmentum  of Man in every posture of it and that discretion of Spirits which the Scriptures mention  Somewhat being occasionally said before concerning the inward Senses I shall here give you a short account of the internal Senses according to the  Platonick Philosophy  by the benefit of which one Man perceives what another does not  Caelius Rhodig  tells us That the vivifying Act of the Soul on the Vehicle that is  Ant Lect l    c    on the aethereal Body is call'd the Idol of the Soul But you must know this that the Ancients thought there was in this Idol a confus'd energy of the Fancy without Reason and such Senses that the Sight is generally propagated throughout this whole Vehicle as likewise the Hearing but that many do not enjoy these Senses nor is it often but there is in them a power of an admirable nature so that the harmony of the Spheres is perceiv'd by them being otherwise silent and there is heard also a Demonical Voice and Bodies present themselves to the Sight if the Soul withdraws it self in the aetherial corpuscle being after a manner sever'd from the Clog of  the terrestrial and gross Body So its said that  Tatius  the Son of  Mercury  being duly expiated by  Sacred Rites  presently cry'd out that he liv'd now in an Immortal Body and being carry'd aloft he saw and heard wonderful things which  Mercurius  approving said the same was usual with himself There are some that write and among others the  Platonick Olympiodorus  that  Apollonius Tyanaeus  by the power of these Senses when he was in the City being rais'd as it were on a WatchTower saw and told what things were done in  Egypt Plotinus  thought that the first Intellect was the first Essence from which and in which other Intellects are not only by  Idea  's but by their proper Intellectual Existences as I may say of the Soul according to an Intellectual Faculty proper to themselves even while they are in the Body just as Lines drawn from a Center to a Circumference do not depart from the Center while they touch the Circumference Hence he will have it that the Intellect of a Prophet and of an abstracted Man tho' it seems to be only in the  East  may have a prospect also of what things are done in the  West  because all Intellects are every where and in each other since always they are all in the single Divine Mind which is always wholly present every where So far  Rhodig  Now as the  Pythagoreans  and  Platonicks  who many of them had a sensible perception of what they call'd the Harmony of the Spheres Divine Voices  c  set up these  Hypotheses  for explaining things of this kind so it's no wonder that the other Philosophers who had not such abstracted Minds and had no sense of such things did not set up any  hypothesis  for  explaining things they had no sense of and rejected or ridicul'd any  hypothesis  of this nature  I doubt what I have here deliver'd may be too speculative to please all Readers and therefore I shall not dwell upon things of this nature but only say in general that in all Ages and in all Religions there have been Contemplative Persons or such as have much spiritualiz'd themselves in the study of Divine things for detaching Souls from the Creatures by bringing them to an opening of their Inward Senses to fix them on the being infinitely Perfect As the  Esseens  among the  Jews  and the  Platonicks  among the  Pagans  who detach'd Minds as much as possibly they could from Matter to fix them on Metaphysical Meditations and this is what is chiefly driven at by  Mystical Divines  among Christians And it must be granted that humane Reason stands much indebted to this Philosophy for having driven the knowledge of GOD and of a Being infinitely Perfect and of the sole Creator of the World much farther than other Philosophers have done as Monsieur  Dureux  asserts in the beginning of his Book Intituled  Traiteé historique sur la Theologie mystique    To add some farther explanation of the way that some Persons see Spirits when others do not  Cardan  tells us that  Averrhoes    L de Mirab  in his  Collectanea  seems fairly to have accounted for it saying When the Spirit which attends the Imagination has by Imagining receiv'd forms of a Sound or of any quality for discerning by the Smell or Taste or of a dead Man or of a  Daemon  and being imbued with it is convey'd to the Sense which corresponds to  that Action as in Odours to the proper Instrument of Smelling in Hearing to the Ears in Spectres to the Eyes it will necessarily Smell Hear and See without any Object for if Seeing be nought but a Perception of a Species in the  Christalloides  whether that Species comes from the Object or not its manifest as often as this happens it truly sees and so it happens that Persons see  Daemons  or dead Persons being awake and also hear Voices of Persons they know and smell Smells and touch as in the  Incubi  or  Succubi  But these things are more seldom seen than they are heard or touch'd because in the rest of the Senses it suffices to observe one difference and one only Spirit convey'd to the Sense with that Image may represent this But as in the Eyes there are more differences necessary Magnitude Form Colour of necessity more Spirits must be convey'd and for this reason Nature has made those Nerves hollow which pass to the Eyes and only those so because those in their operations stand in need of far more Spirits than any of the other Senses in discerning Hence arises a solution of many Problems which tho' carrying a certain truth yet have brought many to such streights that some have been fain to fly to Miracle others to  Daemons  others have flatly denied the Facts As in  Island  and  Norway  c they think they see some of their Family who are dead and think they embrace them and say they vanish in their Embraces Now  Island  is full of  Bitumen  and the Inhabitants live on Fruits Roots Bread made of Fish and Water and it lying in the frozen Sea by reason of its great Cold it cannot bear standing Corn and much  less Wine Whence the Spirits by reason of the Food the Air by reason of the Soil are very gross therefore by reason of the thickness of the Air and the Vapours concerted through Cold Images wander about as in the Clouds which being conceiv'd through Error Fear and Thought the dense and earthy Spirit so long retains till it be convey'd to the Instrument of Sense therefore they perswade themselves they see and talk with them They think they see Persons of their Acquaintance and such as are dead because they know they are not there living and because they vanish in their Embraces but no Man has feign'd to himself an unknown Figure in the Clouds as of a  Chimaera  or an  Hippocentaure  for we are all carry'd to known things So far  Cardan    But after all this Philosophizing for shewing that all our Senses may be impos'd on by Phantoms I do not find how this any way accounts for those Apparitions which have reveal'd future or hidden things and the like which were not possibly discoverable by any assistance of our Sense or Reason  CHAP IX What perception Men have had of  Genii  or Spirits and their Operations by Dreams  TO say absolutely that all Dreams without any distinction are vain Visions and sports of Nature the Images of things at random coming into our Minds and possessing them while we Sleep and to banish all Divination from the Life of Man as  Epicurus Meterodorus  and  Xenophanes  did is contrary to Experience and the common Consent and Agreement of Mankind So that we may argue with  Averrhoes  in his  Paraphrase  there is no Man but has had Dreams which have foretold him something and therefore they are not only the Sports of Nature and vain Appearances  L    Pliny  a Man little credulous in matters of Faith writes That the cures of many Diseases unknown before had been discover'd in Dreams  Porphyrius  to explain Divine Dreams says That God has given to each Man two  Daemons  to attend him a good and a bad and that the good and propitious  Daemons  foreshew us in our Dreams Evils to come prepar'd for us by evil  Daemons  adding that if any Man could rightly discern those things that are intimated to us in our Sleep he would be freed from all Evils and become an egregious Prophet  Psellus l de  Daemon  says That  Daemons  come to those that are worthy of their Society and give them the knowledge of future things And the  Platonicks  deride the  Peripateticks  for referring the Works of  Daemons  as Divinations a manifestation of occult things and the speaking of various Tongues to Humours and the Steams of the Earth  Dion Cassius  writes thus The cause which moved me to write this History was this  Rom Hist l    When I had writ a Book of those Dreams and Prodigies which had given  Severus  hopes of the Principality and had sent it to  Severus  and he had read it and had writ me back many kind things after receiving his Letter in the Evening I went to Bed and in my Sleep it was Divinely Commanded me to write an History wherefore I writ the things I now treat of which proving very pleasing to  Severus  and others I presently resolved to go through writing the whole  Roman History  And tho' I took upon me the Composing of this History with reluctancy and at first wholly rejected it my  Goddess  encouraged me in my Sleep and gave me good hopes that this History should never Perish which  Goddess  I take to be the Guardianess of my Life  The same Author concludes the last Book of his History thus At length being taken ill in my Feet I was dismist of all Employs to pass all the remainder of my Life in my Country as my  Genius  had plainly signified to me in  Bythinia  who also once seem'd to command me in my Dream to add these Verses to the end of my History  From Arms and cruel Slaughters Dust and Pain  Iliad    Sustained in Wars  Jove Hector  has withdrawn  Cardan  tho' he had writ ten Books of Dreams yet in his Book  De Mirabilibus  tells us how he was often admonish'd in his Dreams to write his One and Twenty Books  De Subtilitate  of which the foremention'd Book is one and he says these did not seem Dreams to him but somewhat greater and that his Books  De Rerum varietate  were so likewise shewn him and that it was a property belonging to his Family which he had both by his Fathers and Mothers side to Dream of what would happen to him and this he has set forth that Men may know there is somewhat in us besides our selves There is he says in all Men but it incites some to Vertue because they will have it so others to Murther Poisonings  c  what says he do they think the Mind of a Wicked Man to be is Man there alone or are there Fears Hatreds Suspiscions Angers and Torments of Mind so that when a Man has given himself over to their power he cannot be master of himself In all of us there are buried Seeds and Sprouts of a contrary Faction wherefore no Man can be excited to Vertue nor have an experience of Truth in Dreams who overwhelms and buries that which is in him beside himself for there are three Factions within us Evil  Daemons  a clear Light and Pleasure wherefore true Dreams a foresight of Futurities and wonderful things happen even to wicked Men I know what may be objected against me that forsooth I would seem a Divine Man Do they think me of so little Sense that I know  not Men will rather impute this as a Vanity to me than turn it to my Praise but the things I have seen and know I cannot conceal tho' it be to my extream prejudice It's no small comfort to me that when the same things happened to  Galen  the same Fear the same Suspicion which he confest he was not Ignorant of yet he chose rather to obey his Impulse and not to conceal the things he knew to the hazard of his Fame than to mind the Glory of Men If any Man may haply suspect me for seeking from this an opinion of Sanctity let him know that no Man among the Ancients more constantly asserted the Mortality of the Soul than  Galen  and that I am a Sinner Wherefore the reason of these things must be deduct elsewhere for they belong to the Books  De Arcanis A  ternitatis de Fato  not to the present dispute nor are they proper for it So far  Cardan  And I desire this may serve for an Answer to what some Men haply may be inclined to object to my self in reference to what I have delivered in this Book as to any experience of my own in this or the like kind for I as freely own my self guilty of many Failings as  Cardan  did or any other Man may  To come nearer to our Times  G  ss  ndus  in the Life of  Peireskius  writ by himself relates so strange a Dream which happened to him that  Peireskius  upon telling it him more than once said that if another Man had related it he should not have believed him  In his return  Anno  in the beginning of  May  from  Montp  lier  to  Nismes  he had in his Company one  James Rainer  a Citizen of  ix  who was wont to Lodge in the same Chamber  with him and now did so in an Inn on the Road as  Peireskius  Slept  Rainer  observed he muttered somewhat to himself after an unusual manner whereupon  Rainer  Awakened him and ask'd him what was the matter Oh said he from what a pleasant and grateful Dream have you roused me  Rainer  asking him what it was I was Dreaming said he that I was at  Nismes  and that a  Goldsmith  offered me a Golden Medal of  Julius Caesar  for four Crowns and I was upon paying him his Mony for it when upon your unseasonable Awaking me both  Goldsmith  and Medal Vanished They went on to  Nismes  and being there  Peireskius  took a turn in the City till Dinner was ready and by a wonderful chance he happened on a  Goldsmiths  Shop and asked the  Goldsmith  whether he had any Rarity to shew him he told him he had a  Julius Caesar  of Gold he asked him the Price and was answered four Crowns which he presently paid him and taking the Medal by an admirable hit of Fortune he fulfilled his Dream It may be said admirable for he might easily have thought of  Nismes  where he was to be the next Morning he might have thought of that Coin of  Julius Caesar  which he had often wished for being awake he might have thought it found in that City in which there were so many Footsteps of  Roman Antiquities  he might have thought at a  Goldsmiths  to which sort of Persons such things found are commonly carried he might have thought of a small Price at which  Goldsmiths  rather value those things than Antiquaries he might have thought of four Crowns with which moderate Price a  Goldsmith  might be content In short a  Goldsmith  and that at  Nismes  might have a Medal of that Price but its altogether wonderful that all those things should have concurr'd and the Event answer the Dream And nevertheless  Perieskius  was not the Man who for all this thought the cause of this Dream preternatural as haply he might have done if the like Dream had often happen'd but as he knew the sports of Chance he only accounted this among those which by their rareness are wont to create a stupor in the vulgar So far  Gassendus    Amyraldus  writ a Discourse in  French  concerning  Divine Dreams  which Discourse was Translated and Printed in  English An  In it this Dream of  Peireskius  is inserted and plac'd among Angelical Dreams I shall here give you some account of that Discourse as follows  The First Chapter treats of  Natural Dreams  which he concludes thus It's true sometimes it happens that some of these Dreams come to pass which makes us think there is some resemblance or agreement betwixt the Dream and the Event and by consequence that some  Angel  or  Spirit  is concerned therein but as  Aristotle  has observ'd This happens by meer chance as he that without any aim should shoot a thousand Arrows may at last by chance hit the Mark So in our Dreams such an infinite number of Visions  ss in our Imagination that it's not only no Wonder if one should sometimes chance to be true but it would be much more strange if once or twice in our Life it did not so happen but if any of our Dreams do not only come to pass but there also is a remarkable Agreement betwixt  it and the Event and such as we ought necessarily to suppose the Operation of an Intelligent Agent to Intervene we ought not then to reckon this among Natural Dreams but to refer it either to God or to some Action of Angels  His Second Chapter treats of  Angelical Dreams  in general with some Reflections on particular Dreams he says There are two sorts of Dreams which we may impute to  created Intelligences  one where the things signify'd are contain'd in symbolical and mysterious Representations the other where they are propos'd naked without any such resemblances The common Rule of interpreting the former he says is to observe the Agreements which are betwixt the Dreams and their Events and some of these Dreams regard present others future things of both which he gives Instances Those other Dreams which propose things nakedly as they are in themselves have no need of an Interpreter to understand them but when the Event confirms them they are not the less wonderful as the Dreams of  Peireskius  and others which he mentions  The Third Chapter treats of  Divine Dreams  which are also of two sorts one contains Future things under enigmatical and mysterious Representations the other are much more plain and naked of both which he gives Instances▪ Concerning  Divine Dreams  in general he makes three Enquiries Why God has sometimes reveal'd himself in Dreams to his Servants How they could certainly know that those Dreams had God for their Author Whether this way of Revelation by Dreams be yet practised and whether God does still  make use of it under the Dispensation of the Gospel The first of these Questions is treated of in this Third Chapter where he says That as God made use of various means to reveal himself to the Prophets and by them to others so there is no reason why he should have excluded that of Dreams and there is yet this farther reason in particular for them above the others that though there be a great deal of Vanity in ordinary Dreams and that those which proceed from Angels have very often much uncertainty and ambiguity and that some Philosophers as  Aristotle  and others suppos'd no regard to be had to that way of Divination yet it has always been almost the universal Opinion of all Nations that the Divine Being did principally communicate it self to Men by Dreams and generally this Opinion in the Eastern Nations had a very great Reputation so that it was Principally in those Nations that they have reduc'd the Interpretation of Dreams into an Art and have laid down Rules concerning it and because the People of  Israel  were also of the same Opinion God chose to send them such Dreams as were truly Divine thus to fix them to these and so divert them from that Vanity to which other Nations suffer'd themselves to be carryed by those others Beside the Church being then in her Infant State the People were more easily instructed by Dreams than by other ways in which there was need of more clearness and strength of Understanding  The Second Question concerning the Characters by which we may know Dreams truly Divine from vain Delusion is treated of in his Fourth Chapter where he would have us  first note That among these Dreams that proceed from the Operations of Angels there may also be found Divine ones inasmuch as God does not only permit but may command the Impression of them but those he properly calls Angelical Dreams are meerly such as neither the Formation of the Images exceeds their Power nor is the knowledge of the things which these Images represent above their Intelligence nor above the quickness of their Conjectures and Divination He calls some Dreams  Divine  because whether it were that God employ'd Angels to convey them or whether they are immediately caus'd by himself the things signifyed by them far exceed the Natural capacity of an Angels understanding so that it was absolutely impossible they should ever attain to the Knowledge of them but by a particular Revelation therefore those Dreams may be reputed to come from God which by what Messenger soever they are conveyed yet contain such things as God only is able to know and reveal As for the Marks of  Divine Dreams  he says it's certain that  Moses  and others had some certain Marks which absolutely determin'd them to set upon such Actions as they did though others might not know wherein those Marks did consist he observes that God Rules in the Understanding of Wise and Vertuous Men and powerfully inclines it to a Belief and Resolution though it does not see in the object reasons altogether proportionate to the effect it feels in the Soul so that the extraordinarily determination of the Understanding is an evident Proof of the Divinity of the Dream  The Third Question  viz  Whether God makes use of this kind of Dreams now under the Dispensation of the Gospel is treated of in his Fifth Chapter where he says That as for those  Divine Dreams  which are designed to foretel things to come under the Emblem of an Allegorical Representation or to convey some new commands to Men in order to some great and extraordinary Design for which there is need of Divine Authority for the undertaking and executing of it he conceives that time is wholly expir'd and those who pretend to and boast of any such are either Impostors who would abuse the World by their feign'd Visions to serve their own private Interest or Fools who have their Brains disturb'd by Hypochondriacal Vapours and here he delivers his Thoughts concerning a certain kind of People of both Sexes who both in  Poland  and  Germany  have pretended to  Divine Visions  in these latter Days he does not accuse them of Imposture they having given a sufficient Experience of their Piety but affirms That in their Actions they had some transport of Understanding which proceeded from some other Cause than what was truly Divine They were Persons that gave themselves extraordinarily to the reading of the  Apocalypse  and the other Prophesies and their Spirits were so possess'd with the Ideas of those things they there saw where future Events were represented to them that they perswaded themselves their very Dreams and the things they imagin'd they saw in those Extasies they sometimes fell into were Real and Divine Visions and what contributed to this belief was that they suffer'd themselves to be carryed away  by the hopes of those who expect in due time a Prosperity of the Church of God on Earth and a terrible Subversion of all those States and Powers which now oppose the Establishment of Christ's Kingdom And as they zealously desired this they easily imagin'd it to be certain and indubitable divers Texts of Scripture also having some seeming appearance of some such Promises made to the Church of Christ Beside the Melancholick Humour which was naturally predominant in them the Afflictions Hardships and Anxieties they underwent as well from the publick Affairs as their own private Concerns made them very ready to receive all Impressions of Fancy which might shew them any hope of Deliverance or any mitigation of their Troubles be it then that either they Dreamt or that waking they were surpriz'd with some transport of Fancy in which their Soul was perfectly abstracted from the Body and from all Commerce with their Senses as this sometimes happens in Hypochondriacal Distempers these Apocalyptical Images were thus put into a violent motion and fram'd in their Imaginations those pretended Visions which they have since related to us though we have seen in great part by Experience that those Images which they saw in their pretended Enthusiasms either signified nothing at all or if they did yet their vanity and falseness have been confuted by the Events  He subjoyns here a Reflection on those are c  lled  Qu  rs  for boasting of Visions Revelatio  s Divine Inspirations extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit of Extasies and strange Transportations who by their tremblings and  quakings would represent the Motions of Enthusiasts and Prophets and he tells us the Spirit of Christ is a Spirit of Understanding and Prudence and of a sober and well settled Sense and not a Spirit which fills empty Brains with Dark and Phantastical Imaginations nor exposes the true Religion to the Laughter of its Enemies and to the scandal of Sober and Intelligent Men by its indecent and unnatural Motions  As for those Dreams which may proceed meerly from the Impression and Operation of  Angels  both good and bad he says he will not deny but there may be yet some Examples of that kind to be seen and though the Dispensation of the Law under which good Angels were more especially Employed in things relating to Religion be now pass'd yet they continue still to be Ministers and Instruments of Divine Providence in what relates to civil Life and humane Society and especially the Protection of the Faithful and the Defence of the Church of Christ And as it is not impossible but they may sometimes appear to Men waking so it is not incredible but God may make use of them from time to time to convey to Men the notices of some things by Dreams he says there are many Examples of both kinds in the Books of those who have made Collections of them to which Books he refers the Reader but gives us one Instance of Monsieur  Calignan  Chancellor of  Navarre  a Man of singular Vertue who being at  Bearne  one Night as he lay asleep heard a Voice which call'd him by his Name  Calignan  Hereupon awaking and hearing no more of it he imagin'd he Dreamt and fell  asleep again a little after he heard the same Voice calling him in the same manner which made a greater impression on him than before so that being awaken'd he call'd his Wife who was with him and told her what had happen'd so that they both lay waking for some time expecting whether they might hear the Voice again at last the Voice awaken'd him a third time calling him by his Name and advised him to retire presently out of the Town and to remove his Family for that the Plague would rage horribly in that place within a few Days he followed the direction and within a few Days after the Plague began in the Town and destroyed a great number of People Now the Author says whether the Plague came by the Infection of the Air or by some Infectious Persons or whether some Sorcerers and Witches as they say they sometimes do diffus'd their Infectious Poysons in that place neither exceeded the knowledge of the Angels that spake to him He next relates a Dream as strange which happen'd to  L  wis de Bourbon  Prince of  Conde  and in his Conclusion he says there is need of great Circumspection to Judge of these Nocturnal Visions if any such Dream induce us to a good Action and from whence there can follow no bad Event such a Dream ought not to be suspected by us but if it prompts us to evil we ought absolutely to condemn and reject it as a Delusion of the Devil So far  Amyr  ldus    M  l  c  h  n l de Anima  writes concerning the Nature of Dreams as follows I shall not follow the A  ages of Natural Philosophers who striving to refer Dreams of all kinds to  Natural Causes act foolishly but I find four kinds of Dreams  The First is of vulgar Dreams which may be call'd Natural because the Natural and immediate Causes of them are in view as when Images are presented of those things which we think on being awake or when Dreams answer to certain Humours a redundancy or agitation of which moves the Imagation or Spirits  The Second kind I call presaging which nevertheless is not  Divine  but as by a Natural temperament or peculiar property or by a Natural Gift one Person is more Musical than another or has a greater Activity of Body  c  so by a Natural Gift or property many have presaging Dreams painting forth future Events as it were by certain Allegories So  Pontanus  tells us That a certain Soldier at  Genoa  Dreamt he was devoured by a Serpent wherefore on a Day when the other Soldiers were put on board Ships to Fight with the Enemy he kept himself at home but a tumult casually arising in the City he was kill'd by the Ball of a sort of Canon which we call a Serpent This kind of Dreams has not an apparent cause in the Motion or Plenty of the Humours or the first Qualities as we said of the first kind but there are certain presaging Natures call'd by  Aristotle Loquaces Naturae    that have frequent signifying Dreams nor shall I be against it if any Men shall contend that the cause of this property is the excellency of the temperament as Astrologers will have it but those are idle who deliver ways of explaining them and seek Causes in the Motion of Humors  The Third kind is  Divine  which God sends into Minds either by himself or by  Angels  such as the Scriptures tell us were divinely sent and these only are to be rely'd on as certain the others being all fallacious  The Fourth kind is  Diabolical  as when Witches as it seems to them are present at Feasts and Sports when it has been often known by experience that they never went to them but as they lay Sleeping signified by their Gestures and Cries that they Dream'd of Feasting and Dancing Of this kind have been many Superstitious Dreamers of Former Ages and in these our Times we have heard of many Fanatical Dreams of  Anabaptists  Commanding Crimes and Confirming Errors which are easily judged of by Pious and Prudent Persons  Sennertus  in  Epit Phys l    c  writes thus To  Supernatural Dreams  we refer all those which are sent us from Superiour Causes and External to us be they from God Angels or Devils Those that are sent from God and Good Angels are especially called Divine whereof there are some instances in the Scriptures for God is wont either to present new Species to Men in Dreams or so to order and conjoyn those that are in Men before that they are signs of future things and Angels are wont to stir up and aptly dispose those Species Spirits and Humours that are in the Body that they admonish Men of good and necessary things And Diabolical Dreams are caused the same way as by Angels but for a different end  viz  the Destruction of Men  From these things it appears how even absent and future things may be presented to us by our Dreams The  Platonicks  think many Dreams may be referr'd to their  Genii  and  Daemons  which they think attend all particular Persons and conclude that they admonish them of many things but our Divines much more rightly refer them to Angels which attend each Man To which we may add what  Tertull  writes  viz  L de Anim  The gift of Divine Dreams descends ev'n on Prophane Persons God equally affording Rain and Sunshine on the Just and Unjust Since ev'n  Nebuchadnezar  had a Dream sent him by God And as the favour of God reaches even the  Pagans  so the temptation of the Devil does the Saints from whom he is never absent that he may steal upon them unawares when a Sleep if he cannot prevail with them when awake  He there further Philosophizes concerning Dreams as follows  Because in Dreaming Persons the Fancy is employed and some Fantasm is presented to it and we do not Dream only of those things which we have done in the Day or of those things which lye hid in the Body but also of those things which are at a vast distance from us and which we have neither seen heard nor perceived by any Sense nay of those things which are not yet in being but to come afterwards its queried how the Images of things absent and never perceived by the Senses and which are not yet in being can be presented to the Fancy The  Epicure  ns  suppose that Images which fly to and fro and wander in the Air are the causes of this thing  Rhodig Lect Antiq l    c  denies  those Images but contends there are certain Motions which exercise us instead of Images and that those Motions proceed from certain beginings of those things which are shortly after to be said or done by us the Air first chang'd and then being conveyd through the passages of the Ears and Nostrils to the Heart cause that we seem to foreknow the events of future things and these motions cannot at any time bring a more ample sense of themselves than in the Night But how can there be motions of things that are not yet in being or how can things absent Fifty or an Hundred Miles presently affect the Air or why do not those Motions affect all Persons indifferenly asleep in their way but only those whom it concerns to know that thing We refer all those Dreams which we have concerning things that we never perceived before by Sense or from causes that do not lye hid in our Body to a Divine operation  L de Diaet  Quercitan  Philosophizes of Supernatural Dreams thus Supernatural Dreams are in the middle betwixt Divine and Natural in regard their causes are neither referr'd immediately to God nor to the malignity of evil Humours on which the rise of Natural Dreams depends but to our Soul which is awake the Body sleeping and which being stirr'd up by a certain Supernatural Rapt especially the good  Genius  Inspiring represents to us by Dreams and Visions many Fantasms which for the most part Presage somewhat certain the certitude of which is commonly known by the event of things many Instances of those Dreams occur where it has oftem seemed to Persons in Dreams that they fall into some Disease or recover of  it to which Visions the Event afterwards answer'd to all things that they had seen before in their sleep though they were not desir'd nor sought for as Diabolical Dreams are wont to be sought for  Arnoldus de Villa Nova  Dreamt That he was bit in the Foot by a Black Cat the next Day there broke out in that part of his Foot a Cancerous and Malignant Ulcer So far  Quercitan    So  Simlerus  tells us in the Life of  Gesner  That  Gesner  on a Night Dreamt that he was bit by a Serpent and the next Morning said that he should be seiz'd with a Pestilential Carbuncle a few Days after a Carbuncle appear'd in his left Pap five Days before he dyed  To procceed now to give some farther Instances of Dreams from other Authors  Fracastorius  tells us That  Marcus Antonius Flaminius  being at  Genoa  and somewhat indisposed in his Health borrow'd a Book of a Friend to divert him which having read some Days he chanc'd to leave it on a Couch with some other Books and that when the Person that lent it came for it it could by no means be found In the Night time he saw in his Dream a Maid Servant of the House take the Book from the Couch and as she was laying it on a Table the Book chanc'd to fall on the Ground and one side of the Cover was broken and the Maid hid it for fear in a secret place  Flaminius  rising in the Morning and remembring his Dream sought for the Book and found it in that place and charging the Maid Servant with what was done she confess'd that all pass'd as he had said  Celsus Mancinius  of  Ravenna  has writ an Ingenious Tract intitl'd  De Somniis Synesi per Somnia  viz of Dreams and a sagacious perception of things by Dreams in which he has inserted the Dream before set down In his Work he has set forth the Opinions of the most Famous Philosophers concerning the Causes o  Dreams and though he allows the Divine and Angelical Dreams recorded in the Scriptures yet for all other wonderful Dreams he thinks a reason may be rendred of them according to the Doctrine of  Aristotle  viz as casually hapning He gives Instances of many strange Dreams and among others of that of  Flaminius  and explains them all according to  Aristotle  's Doctrine In his th Chapter he says Its known that those who apply themselves to Philosophy and other Arts and Sciences in their sleep by the help of a Powerful Imagination a recent exercise and a strong Attention of Mind Discourse find out and do many things which they had not done nor were able to find out waking and he says  Flaminius  saw those things in his Dream because being troubl'd about the Book he had borrowed and much concern'd that he could not restore it he began to think where the Book might be found he did not Judge it stol'n but seeing other Books remov'd from one place to another  viz  from the Couch to the Table he began to consider who had done it as he thought of this no one could occurr to him more readily nor more suspected than the Maid Servant that constantly attended him That Servant was doubtless free from any Suspicion of Theft for the Book was not likely to yield her much Money  or to be of any use to her therefore he must conclude within himself that in carrying the Books from the Couch to the Table that Book casually fell and broke its cover and because People are wont to hide their Faults or at least to lessen them by some excuse that simple Maid fearing chiding or beating or lest some ill might follow wisely to avoid all hid the Book in the most secret place she could as behind a Chest or some like place Having discourss'd these things by Night in his sleep and upon waking in the Morning remembring his Dream he try'd whether it were true and found all things exactly to answer his Dream He explains other strange Dreams after the same manner according to  Aristotle  's Opinion as casually hapning by a lucky hit of th  Mind in its improv'd way of reasoning in our Sleep  But I doubt this way of explaining will not do in all Cases but we must often have recourse to the Direction of some Superior Intelligences  Mr  Cotton Mather  in his  Ecclesiastical History of New England  writes thus  L    c    Example    Within a Fortnight of my writing this a Physician who sojourned within a Furlong of my House for three Nights together was miserably disturbed with Dreams of his being Drown'd on the third of these Nights his Dreams were so troublesome that he was cast into extream Sweats by strugling under the imaginary Waters With the Sweats yet upon him he came down from his Chamber telling the People of the Family what it was that had so discomposed him Immediately there came in two Friends that asked him to go a little way  with them in a Boat upon the Water he was at first afraid of gratifying them in it but being very calm Weather he recollected himself why should I mind my Dreams or distrust Divine Providence he went with them and before Night by a Thunder Storm suddenly coming up they were all three Drown'd Mr  Mather  says he enquir'd into the truth of this Relation just as he writ it and could assert it  So again  Camerarius  tells us in the Life of  Melancthon  that  Gulielmus Nessenus  on a Day after Dinner in a gentle Sleep he had Dreamt that he was passing a River in a Fisher Boat as he usually did for his Diversion and that the Boat striking on the Trunk of a Tree was overturned and he was Drowned This Dream he told to  Philip Melancthon  who then casually came to see him deriding withal the Vanity of Dreams but that same Evening what he had Dreamt came to pass  Mr  William Smythies  Curate of St  Giles  's  Criplegate An  published an account of the Robbery and Murther of  John Stockden Victualler  in  Grubstreet  within the said Parish and of the Discovery of the Murtherers by several Dreams of  Elizabeth  the Wife of  Thomas Greenwood  a Neighbour to the said  Stockden  An Abstract of which Account I give you as follows  Mr  Smithies  first telling us that none can doubt but great Discoveries have been made by Dreams who read the Life of Sir  Henry Wotton  and our  English  Chronicles particularly the Murther of  Waters  and the Discovery of it by a Dream recorded by Sir  Richard Baker  in his Chapter of Casualties in the  Reign of  James  the First and other Histories he says Mr  Stockden  was Robb'd and Murthered by three Men in his own House on the  d  day of  December  about Midnight A little after the Murther there came a Woman into the Street and said she believed one  Maynard  to be one of the Murtherers because she was informed he was full of Mony both Silver and Gold upon which there was a Warrant against him but he could not be found Soon after this  Stockden  appear'd to  Elizabeth Greenwood  in a Dream and shew'd her an House in  Thamesstreet  near the  George  and told her that one of the Murtherers was there she went the next Morning and took one  Mary Buggas  an Honest Woman who lived near her to go with her to the Place to which her Dream directed and asking for  Maynard  was inform'd that he Lodg'd there but was gone abroad After that  Stockden  soon appeared again to Mrs  Greenwood  and then representing  Maynard  's Face with a flat Mole on the side of his Nose whom she had never seen signified to her that a  Wiredrawer  must take him and that he should be carried to  Newgate  in a Coach Upon enquiry they found out one of that Trade who was his great Intimate and who for a reward of Ten Pounds promised him on his Taking undertook it and effected it He sent to  Maynard  to meet him upon extraordinary Business at a Publick House near  Hockley in the H  le  where he Played with him till a Constable came who apprehended him and carried him before a Magistrate who Committed him to  Newgate  and he was carried thither in a Coach  Maynard  being in Prison confest the horrid Fact and discover'd his Accomplices who were one  Marsh Bevel  and  Mercer  and said that  Marsh  was the setter on being a near Neighbour to  Stockden  who knew he was well furnished with Mony and Plate and though  Marsh  were not present at the Robbery yet he met to have a share of the Booty  M  rsh  knowing or suspecting that  Maynard  had discoverd him left his Habitation  Stockden  appear'd soon after to Mrs  Greenwood  and seem'd by his Countenance to be displeas'd he carried her to an House in  Oldstreet  where she had never been and shew'd her a pair of Stairs and told her that one of the Men Lodg'd there the next Morning she took  M  ry Bugges  with her to the House according to the direction of the Dream where she asked a Woman if one  Marsh  did not Lodge there to which the Woman replyed that he often came thither This  Marsh  was taken soon after in another place  After this Mr    Greenwood  Dreamt that  Stockden  carried her over the  Bridge  up the  Burr  ugh  and into a Yard where she saw  Bevil  the third Criminal whom she had never seen before and his Wife upon her  el  ing this Dream it was believed that it was one of the Prison Yards and thereupon she went with Mrs  Footman  who was  Stockden  's Kinswoman and Housekeeper and was Gagg'd in his House when he was Murthered to the  M  lshalsea  where they enquired for  Bevil  and were inform'd that he was lately brought thither for Coining and that he was taken  e  r the  Ban  side  according to a Dream which Mrs  Greenwood  had before of his being there  they desired to see him and when he came he said to Mrs  Footman Do you know me  she replyed  I do not  whereupon he went from them Mrs  Greenwood  then told Mrs  Footm  n  that she was sure of his being the Man whom she saw in her Sleep They then went into the Cellar where Mrs  Greenwood  saw a lusty Woman and privately said to Mrs  Footman  that's  Bevil  's Wife whom I saw in my Sleep they desired that  Bevil  might come to them and first put on his Periwig which was not on the time before the lusty Woman said why should you speak with my Husband again since you said you did not know him he came the second time and said  Do you know  e now  Mrs  Footman  replyed  No  but it proceeded from a sudden Fear that some Mischief might be done to her who had very narrowly escaped Death from him when she was Gagg'd and as soon as she was out of the Cellar she told Mrs  Greenwood  that she then remembred him to be the Man They went soon after to the Clerk of the Peace and procured his removal to  Newgate  where he confest the Fact and said  To the Grief of my Heart I Killed him    Mrs  Greenwood  did not Dream any thing concerning  Mercer  who was a Party concern'd but would not consent to the Murther of  Stockden  and preserved Mrs  Footman  's Life nor has there been any discovery of him since but he is Escaped and the three others were Hang'd  After the Murtherers were taken Mrs  Greenwood  Dreamt that  Stockden  came to her in the Street and said  Elizabeth I Thank thee the God of Heaven Reward thee for what thou h  st done  Since which she has been at quiet  from those Frights which had much Tormented her and caused an alteration considerable in her Countenance  This Relation is Certified by the  Lord Bishop of Gloucester  who with the then  Dean of York  the  Master of the Charterhouse  and Dr  Alix  had the Particulars of the foregoing Narrative from Mrs  Greenwood  and Mrs  Buggas    When Dr  Harvey  who was afterwards  Fellow  of the  College of Physicians  in  London  being a Young Man went to Travel towards  Padua  he went to  Dover  with several others and shew'd his Pass as the rest did to the Governour there The Governour told him that he must not go but he must keep him Prisoner the Doctor desired to know for what reason how he had Transgress'd he said it was his will to have it so the Pacquet Boat hoisted Sail in the Evening which was very Clear and the Doctor's Companions in it There ensued a terrible Storm and the Pacquet Boat and all the Passengers were Cast away The next day the sad News was brought to  Dover  the Doctor was unknown to the Governour but by Name and Face but the Night before the Governour had a perfect Vision in a Dream of Dr  Harvey  who came to pass over to  Calais  and that he had a warning to stop him This the Governour told the Doctor the next day and the Doctor told this Story to several of his Acquaintance here in  London  This Relation I took from Mr  Aubrey  's Miscellanies and I think it hard I may say impossible to account for this Dream and that of Monsieu  Calignon  before set down by any occult w  of improv'd Reasoning in our Sleep  Claude de Tisserant  a  Parisian  Printed an  History of Prodigies An  where he writes That the Wife of one of the Chief of the Parliament of  Provence  Dreamt that her Husband was Executed as he really was in the City of  Paris  and at her Awaking found her Hand so stiff that she could not ply it and in it was the Image of her Husband represented with his Head Cut off the said Image being all Bloody this Image having been seen by many Persons yet alive it not being above Years since the thing happen'd  Alex ab Alexand  tells us  Gen Die  l    c    That an Ingenious Young Man who lived with him he having the care of his Education saw in his Dream his Mother carried in a Funeral to be Interr'd whereupon he fell into great Sighs and Lamentations whom  Alexander  caused to be awaken'd and then ask'd him why he so Lamented he answered his Mother was Dead and in his Sleep he saw her carrying to be Buried  Alexander  observed the day and time that this Vision happen'd a little while after a Messenger came to him with the News of his Mother's Death of whom asking the day it happened he found she died the same day that the Vision was seen By which Example he says with others of the like kind we are prompted to believe that God has given us a Divinatory Spirit and Prophetick Foresight of future things in our Dreams  Cardan  writes thus  Synes Somn l    c    Joannes Maria Maurosenus  a Senator of  Venice  my particular Friend while he was  Pr  tor  in  Dalmatia  saw in his Dream one of his Brothers whom he much lov'd Embrace him and bid him farewel because he was going to the other World  Joan Maria  having followed him a little way Weeping awak'd all in Tears and was in a great fear for his Brother at  Venice  On the third day Letters were brought him from home signifying that his Brother  Donatu  for that was his Name died on that night and hour after he had lain three days Sick of a Pestilential Fever This he related to me more than once with Tears in his Eyes  The same Author writes in the next Paragraph That  Ludovicus Madius  his Countryman had a Soldier Sleeping in a Chamber who on a certain Night cry'd out in his Sleep his Master ask'd him What ayl'd him he answered That he Dreamt he had received a great Wound in the Head and that he was upon Dying and therefore he awak'd in a Fright his Master who Loved him commanded him not to stir out of Doors mean while his Companions the next day had a mind to visit the Enemy he forgetting his Dream goes forth with them the Enemy appearing his Companions Fled and he was Slain his Head being Cloven asunder  He there tells us also That  M Anton Taurellus  was admonished by a Dream wherein he saw himself a Drowning whereupon he resolved not to go a Swimming that day but forgeting his Dream and returning to his Swimming he was Drown'd  S  Austin  tells us That one  Praestantius  desired a Solution of a Doubt of a Philosopher which he refused to give him the night following  Pr  stantius  being awake saw this Philosopher stand by and solve the Doubt and presently to go away  Praestantius  meeting him the next day ask'd him why having refused  to solve the Question the day before he came to him at midnight of his own accord and Solv'd it to which the Philosopher reply'd  I c  me not truly but in my Dream I seem'd to do this to you    Magnenu  in his  Exercitations on Tobacco  says  Exer c    such Dreams as these happen for that the Person that Dreams representing to himself such a Man endeavours to produce a sense of things not beneath the authority of that Man or the Idea he has of him hence sometmies they have such Conceptions which are owing not to themselves but to the reputation of so great a Man Wise  Epictetus  very well knew this who commands that our Mind be raised by some Man of great Repute which we may propose to our selves to be Imitated and may hear and behold him as present  Propose to your self  says he  what  Socrates  or  Zeno  would do in such a Case Enc  ri c    He adds beneath That Sagacious Vertue which exerts it self in Man freely discovers it self by an Instinctual  Impetus  and I have often perceived in my Sleep what exactly fell out the next day So when I have gone to Sleep with a fixed thought on a Person Sick a meet Remedy has been represented to me in my Dream which nicely weighing in my Judgment the next morning I have thought it Excellent and given it with great Success I had read the same had happen'd to  Hippocrates  and  Galen  but doubted of its Truth but I have found by my own experience that a Nature prone to a Business finds most compendious ways for it which others scarce ever attain  In vitâ Minerva  as  Ptolomy  says  Cent    Galen  tells us That Women while they are with Child often see their Childrens Fortunes in their Sleep and that  Cypsalis  and  Pericles  began to be formidable to  Greece  from the Womb Here  Cardan  adds The Soul seems then to be most pure as it newly comes from Heaven and to foresee and shew future things to Parents  In the Life of the late Sir  Henry Wotton  we find an account of a Dream of his Father  Thomas Wotton    Esq  as follows A little before his Death he Dreamt that the University of  Oxford  was Robb'd by Townsmen and poor Scholars and that the Number was Five and being that day to write to his Son  Henry  at  Oxford  he thought it worth so much pains as by a  Postscript  to his Letter to make a slight enquiry of it The Letter was writ out of  Kent  and came to his Sons hands the very morning after the night in which the Robbery was committed for the Dream was true and the Circumstances tho' not in the exact time and when the City and University were both in a perplext Inquest of the Thieves then did Sir  Henry Wotton  shew his Fathers Letter and by it such light was given to this work of darkness that the Five Guilty Persons were presently Discovered and apprehended without putting the University to so much trouble as the Casting of a Figuer  We are also told in the next Paragraph That the said  Thomas Wotton    Esq  and his Uncle  Nicholas Wotton  who was Dean of  Canterbury  both foresaw and foretold the days of their Deaths  Selneccerus  tells us in his  Calendar  concerning  Christian  King of  Denmark  That he foretold his Death both to his Chaplain  M Paulus Noviomagus  and to  D Cornelius  his Physician  Jacobus Scutellarius  a Famous Astronomer of  Prague  Physician to the Emperour  Rodolphus  the Second had a foreknowledge of his Death eight days before it happen'd and affirm'd for certain he should Die on the th of  December An  That Famous Astronomer  Leonardus Thurnisser  certainly foreknew the day of his death made his Will and commanded his Landlord that he should Bury him by the side of  Albertus Magnus  which was done He Died the th of  July An  There is at  Rome  this Monument  To  Seraphinus Oductius Strancionicus  Famous Physician a most Ingenious Prophet and a Man skilled in all manner of Learning who being seized with a vehement Fever foreknew and most constantly foretold the day and Hour of his Death  Theophilus  his Son erected this Monument he Died the    th of the  Calends  of  Sept An  having Lived    Years    Months and    Days    This I take from  Kormannus L de Mirac Mort Part    c  who in the said Book and the same  part c  writes as follows concerning  Presaging Dreams  That Dreams sometimes presage Death many examples testify That of King  Pharaoh  's Baker  Gen c  The Dream of  Lucius Scylla  the  Roman  The Dream of  Calphurnia  the Wife of  Julius Caesar  The Dream of  Cicero  in  Valerius  The Dream of  Alexander the Great  in the same The Dream of  Simonides  The Dream of  Cressus  King of  Lydia  The Dream of the  Arcadian  in  Meg  ra  in the same The Dream of  Flav Valerius  of  Marcian  the Emperor The Dream of  Elizabeth de l'Arche  the Mother of the  Pu  elle of Orleance  The Dream of  Polycarpe  The Dream of the Scholar of  Pavia  All which  M Ancermus Julianus  has learnedly compiled in his  Book of Dreams and nocturnal Visions    An ancient Gentleman now living in  London  has told me That many Years since he had occasion to make a Journey into the North and that being a Bed in his Inn the first Night of his Journey a Friend of his Dead not long before appeared to him in his Dream and told him he had lodg'd  l  in the hands of a Person whom he named and who was well known to the Gentleman I write of for the use of his Daughter and he desired him That upon his return to  London  he would put the Person in mind of it and desire him to take care to pay the Mony The Gentleman after his return took an oportunity to wait on the said Person and after common discourses were over told him That such a Friend of theirs whom he nam'd lately Dead had communicated a Secret to him  viz  that he had lodg'd  l  in his hands for the use of his Daughter and that as she would grow Marriagable in a short time he might do well to pay it The Person freely own'd the thing and pay'd the Mony accordingly the Gentleman from whom I had the Relation having known nothing of it but in his Dream And this is remarkable that the Gentleman who paid the Mony chanced to fail in about three Months after  To give some Account of what experience I have had my self in Dreams  Synesi Som l    c    As  Cardan  tells us that beside the Oracle and Prophecy there  are four kinds of Dreams  viz Monitory Persuasive Deterring  and  Impelling  So I have had some of all these four kinds and have been guided by them in many material circumstances of my Life many times the  Genii  which have attended me as I have lain in my Bed have bid me go to Sleep saying That they would suggest something to me in my Dream which they have performed and when the Dream was over they having suggested what they pleased they have sensibly push'd my Shoulder or taken me by the Armrist or toucht some other parts of my Body to awake me and have bid me consider of what I had seen in my Sleep And though I have then generally found the things enigmatically represented yet the meaning was obvious enough and I have guided my self by it  Dr  Bekker  who takes upon him to solve all Appearances in  Dreams  or others by Natural Reason without any Agency or Spirits in the Third Volume of his Work entitled  L  monde Enchante c  writes thus There is a certain way of Presage or of Prognostick Signs which relates to certain particular Persons and their Concerns when a Man by some extraordinary Vision by the hearing or some sensible Perception of something is advertis'd before hand of something which will happen to him or of what is presently to happen This is what I agree in and I shall give the Reason of it in my Fourth Part and here I shall only explain the thing after the way I conceive it for Instance some one Dreams that himself or one of his will die or that he sees his own Figure or that of another Person before him or in a Coffin or that he hears some  one knocking on it to Nail him in that he preceives some one to take him by the Hand or to strike him on the Shoulder and all other things of this Nature but in the same degree as those beforemention'd without going farther that is to say in things that concern our selves and those that belong to us and in respect of what is Natural not with Persons that have no Communication with us or concerning things that are wholly contingent and casual and that depend on the Choice of Mens Wills If beyond this somewhat often happens it is not against Nature nor above it nor out of its Power for before such a Dream happens a Man has thought perhaps more than once with great Affliction of his Death▪ since a Dream comes from much thinking on a thing and that the Affliction partly causes the Distemper or having increas'd it Death Naturally follows but it's more difficult to comprehend how this may also happen in respect of other Persons for a Man has not so strong a tye with another Mean while as I observe that Naturalists assigns two Causes that give Birth to  Sympathy  or a mutual Inclination which manifestly appears in Men Beasts Plants Trees and in many other Bodies by which they naturally Unite themselves together or keep far asunder from each other and in their Operations they find not Reason to reject as incredible ev'n these Apparitions in a Dream but we ought also to conclude from thence that the Natural cause being thus known the Devil has nothing to do in it  We explain more particularly  Sympaphy  after the way following We say then first That each Body ev'n though so little it can scarce  be perceiv'd is compos'd of an Infinity of little Parts and that these little Parts are interwoven the one with the other after a very unequal manner that it's for this that two Bodies whereof the least Parts or Atoms are woven after an equal manner have also a tye one with the other for they are invested with an object which is the same or at least of the same Nature and of an equal manner wherefore those which are of an equal Composition of Parts will receive the one as well as the other after such or such a manner a like desire or like food in eating and drinking and as this texture has place particularly in the Naturnal mixture of Man's Body we call this  Equality of Humors  and according then as these Particles agree and are woven and dispos'd well or ill together this is call'd  Good  or  Ill Humor  of a Man but this is not yet all the Particles thus Interlact for the Composition of a Body are withal little volatile Parts which pass away in Vapours continually both outwardly and inwardly whereof we may see as far as the Eye can discover some what a Proof in the Smoak or Vapour of hot Blood for this Vapour is nought but a quantity of those little Parts mixt the one with the other in a volatile and continual Motion▪ these Particles exhale from one Body into another Now in all things this holds that every where like seeks its like and joyns with its like when in the commerce of Humane Life this does not happen so exteriourly it's because this coupling or joyning is not made by a necessity of Nature but by Deliberation and nevertheless there will be still a s  c  et cause in the Sympathy of these Nature  which  not appear so outwardly  We must add to what we have said before the force of the Imagination whereof Expeperience teaches us amazing thinks It is to speak thus as openly as we may as out of the Operation of the Exteriour Senses that Spirits that is to say the said Exhalation and Evaporation of the most subtle Parts mounting from the Heart to the Brain where they expose a like Representation as that of the common Sense of Man by the means of the Senses but otherwise brought from without according then as the Brain is tender or hard moist or dry or that a Person is old or young a Man or a Woman that the one or the other finds himself Sick or in Health According to all this I say something is imprinted more easily or more difficulty in the Brain the Spirits having more or less Communication with those of another Body equal to this by the means of the Exhalation and Evaporation of the least Parts outwardly and inwardly this happens most commonly in a Sickness and above all in a Mortality thence comes the contagion of the Air and of the Blood This being so Men may also in case of a Sickness or Mortality or of some Iminent danger while the Blood and Spirits are particularly mov'd have a lively foreperceiving that is to say the Woman in respect of her Husband the Child in regard of his Mother and the Mother in regard of her Child Brothers and Sisters in regard the one of the other and even a Friend and a Comrade in respect of those with whom they have contracted a Friendship and Society and though they are far distant they cease not to have this foreperceiving since the volatile Particles  disperse themselves to many Leagues distance and tend the one towards the other  Experience wholly proves what I say the most subtle Parts and their Exteriour and Interriour attraction of one Body in another causes that the Loadstone draws the Iron for what draws reciprocally touches This touch fortifies the texture of the Particles the one with the others and so that what does not touch reciprocally does not draw That these little Parts disperse themselves very far is what is taught us by the trace of a Dog this Beast in following it will find by the sole means of the smell in which consists the Motion of these subtle Parts the Tract of any one that has travell'd to Fifty nay even to an Hundred Leagues of way by Land and Water in fair Weather and Tempestuous As for the Imagination its a thing manifest by the wonderful Experience and Operation it has while Women are with Child on the Fruit without speaking at present of other Examples which may find their place in the Sequel  I conclude therefore at present that this Communication and this Motion of the volatile Parts of the Bodies of Persons that have love the one for the others or that are of a very equal Nature be it far or near produces such a thing This admirable Participation makes an equal Impression on the Brain as we find ill Weather causes it self to be foreperceiv'd in a Man's Limbs or chiefly in those of a Beast I say such an Impression is made when there i  a Person sick or that a sickness Foments it self in his Limbs or that he dies or is on the point of Death its to this Person as a Dream he understands he sees he p  rceives something  and this also troubles him When there has happen'd to him after an extraordinary manner such a Perception or Dream Waking it's the same thing as the Imaginations that never happen'd to him after the same manner or near it or that he has been used all the times he has made this experience to see somewhat like this to follow he may take it for a sign not of a Devil or of a Spirit but as being wholly Natural We may also freely believe that by reason of the unequal constitution of the Brain Blood and Spirits in some Men one also ought to be subject more to these kinds of rencounters than another this causes that we may say in some manner with Reason that one Man may see more Fantoms than another  I shall forbear to incert more here from Dr  Bekker  referring the Reader to his Works and I shall conclude this Chapter with a Relation or two for Men to consider how Dr  Bekker  's Philosophy before laid down may serve to explain them tho' in truth these Relations might have been somewhat more properly inserted in some precedent Chapter than this of Dreams  The first is concerning that Duke of  Buckingham  who was Stabbed by  Felton Aug    Mr  illy  the  Astrologer  in his Book Entituled  Monarchy or no Monarchy in England  Printed in Having mentioned the Death of the Duke of  Buckingham  writes as follows Since I am upon the Death of  Buckingham  I shall relate a true Story of his being admonished often of the Death he should Die in this manner  An Aged Gentleman one  Parker  as I now remember having formerly belonged unto the Duke or of great acquaintance with the Duke's Father and now retired had a  Daemon  appeared several times to him in the shape of Sir  George Villier's  the Dukes Father this  Daemon  walk'd many times in  Parker  's BedChamber without any action of terrour noise hurt or speech but at last one Night broke out in these Words  Mr  Parker  I know you loved me formerly and my Son  George  at this time very well I would have you go from me you know me very well to be his Father Old Sir  George Villiers  of  Leicestershire  and to acquaint him with these and these particulars  c  and that he above all refrain the Council and Company of such and such whom he then nominated or else he will come to destruction and that suddenly Parker  though a very discreet Man partly imagined himself in a Dream all this time and being unwilling to proceed upon no better grounds forbore addressing himself to the Duke for he conceived if he should acquaint the Duke with the words of his Father and the manner of his appearance to him such Apparitions being not usual he should be Laugh'd at and thought to dote in regard he was Aged Some few Nights past without farther Trouble to the Old Man but not very many nights after Old Sir  George Villiers  appeard again walk'd quick and furiously in the Room seem'd Angry with  Parker  and at last said  Mr  Parker  I thought you had been my Friend so much and loved my Son  George  so well that you would have acquainted him with what I desired but I know you have not done it by all the Friendship that ever was betwixt you  nd me and  the great respect you bear my Son I desire you to deliver what I formerly commanded you to my Son  The Old Man seeing himself thus sollicited promised the  Daemon  he would but first argued it thus that the Duke was not easy to be spoken withal and that he would account him a Vain Man to come with such a Message from the Dead nor did he conceive the Duke would give any credit to him to which the  Daemon  thus answered  If he will not believe you have this Discourse from me tell him of such a Secret and named it which he knows none in the World ever knew but my self and him  Mr  Parker  being now well satisfied that he was not asleep and that the Apparition was not a vain Delusion took a fit oportunity and seriously acquainted the Duke with his Father's words and the manner of his Apparition The Duke heartily Laught at the Relation which put old  Parker  to a stand but at last he assumed Courage and told the Duke that he acquainted his Fathers Ghost with what he found now to be true  viz  Scorn and Derision but my Lord says he your Father bid me acquaint you by this token and he said it was such as none in the World but your  selves did yet know hereat the Duke was amazed and much astonished but took no warning or notice thereof keeping the same Company still advising with such Counsellors and performing such Actions as his Father by  Parker  countermanded Shortly after Old Sir  George Villiers  in a very quiet but sorrowful Posture appears again to  Parker  and said  Mr  Parker  I know you deliver'd my words to  George  my Son I thank you for so doing  h  ighted them and now I only request this more  at your hands that once again you repair to my Son and tell him that if he will not amend and follow the Counsel I have given him this Knife or Dagger and with that he pull'd a Knife or Dagger from under his Gown shall end him and do you Mr  Parker  set your House in order for you shall die at such a time  Mr  Parker  once more engaged though very unwillingly to acquaint the Duke with this last Message and so did but the Duke desir'd him to trouble him no farther with such Messages and Dreams and told him he perceived he was now an Old Man and Doted and within a Month after meeting Mr  Parker  on  LambethBridge  said  Now Mr  Parker  what say you of your Dream  who only return'd  Sir I wish it may never have Success  c but within six Weeks after he was Stab'd with a Knife according to his Fathers Admonition beforehand and Mr  Parker  Died soon after he had seen the Dream or Vision perform'd  This Relation is Inserted also in the Lord  Clarendon  's  History  and in Sir  Richard Baker  's  Chronicle  The Lord  Clarendon  in his History  Vol  I  L  having given some Relations says  hat amongst others there was one meaning this of  Paker  which was upon a better foundation of Credit than usually such Discourses are founded upon And he tells us that  Parker  was an Officer in the Kings  Wardrobe  in  Windsor Castle  of a good reputation for honesty and discretion and then about the Age of Fifty Years or more This Man had in his Youth been bred in a School in the Parish where Sir  George Villiers  the Father of the Duke liv'd and had been much cherished and obliged in that Season of his Age by the said  Sir  George  whom afterwards he never saw About Six Months before the miserable end of the Duke of  Buckingham  the Apparition was seen after the third appearance he made a Journey to  London  where the Court then was he was very well known to Sir  Ralph Freeman  one of the  Masters of Requests  who had Married a Lady that was near allied to the Duke and was himself well received by him He Informed the Duke with the Reputation and Honesty of the Man and Sir  Ralph Freeman  carry'd the Man the next Morning by Five a Clock to  Lambeth  according to the Duke's appointment and there presented him to the Duke who received him Courteously at his Landing and walked in conference near an Hour with him and Sir  Ralph  's and the Duke's Servants at such a distance that they heard not a word but Sir  Ralph  always fixt his Eyes on the Duke who sometimes spoke with great commotion and disorder and that the Man told Sir  Ralph  in their return over the Water that when he mentioned those particulars that were to gain him credit the Duke's colour changed and he Swore he could come to that Knowledge only by the Devil for that those particulars were known only to himself and to one Person more who he was sure would never speak of them So far the Lord  Clarendon  And I think Dr  Bekker  's Hypothesis will hardly clear this matter  I shall only add here a small relation of a thing that happened to my self About Six Years since a Gentleman whom I had never seen nor heard of before came to my Lodgi  g which was then in  Fetterlane  about Six of the Clock in the Morning it being  Summer time he found a Servant of the House and asked him whether I were stirring and finding not he desired the Servant to go to me and acquaint me of his being there and that he desired if it might not be troublesome he might be admitted to my Bedside I admitted it and upon his coming to me he told me he was directed to me by a Lady a Relation of mine whom he had met at  Hamstead  he having a desire to discourse with me concerning an Affair in which he understood I had some knowledge After some discourse was over I asked him his Name which he told me then I asked him where he Lived he replyed in  CaneWood  whereupon I was somewhat surprized for that very Morning at Three of the Clock I was awaked out of my Sleep by a loud Voice saying  Cane Cane Cane  now whether the intentness of the Gentlemans Thought of coming to me wrought this upon my Mind or how else it came to pass may require consideration  CHAP X What perception Men have had of  Genii  or Spirits and their Operations by Magical Practices  THE Learned  Ludovicus Capellus  writ a Book Entituled  The Hinge of Faith and Religion  which was Published in  English An  In the Tenth Chapter of that Book he draws a reason to prove a Deity from  Wizards Magicians Inchanters  and from all the  Heathen  Idolatry and Superstition where he writes thus  It's a certain thing which the experience of our days and that of all Ages does averr which the monuments of Histories both Ancient and Modern confirm and which the Writings as well of Heathens as of Christians certifie that there are and have been at all times in the World  Witches Magicians Diviners Inchanters  and such like notorious wicked People that have a familiar Communication and a frequent Commerce with Devils by whose help and power they do many strange and prodigious things above and beyond all humane Wisdom all which consequently infers that these things proceed from a supernatural and immaterial cause such as  Daemons  are  The Laws made and promulgated in all well governed States and Commonwealths as well that of the  Jews  by  Moses  as that of the  Christians  and of the  Heathens  themselves do evidence this to us The Executions and Supplices which Justice frequently inflicts on such Persons the Processes the Relations and Informations that are made about them do assure us of this and leave no doubt of it The damnable curiosity of many Persons which every day have recourse to such as they to know see and do all those things that cannot be done by any other means does also confirm this The Writings of the  Heathens  as well  Greeks  as  Romans  are full of Instances of such Persons and of their effects which are stupendious and wonderful so that a Man must wholly renounce his Reason and believe nothing of those things that are done if he will not also believe that there are such Persons which is true and manifest by all those kinds of Testimonies and Monuments which may induce us to believe any thing  Now if there are any  Witches Inchanters  c it necessarily follows that there are  Daemons  by whose help and power they cause these prodigious effects to come to pass which Men wonder at and look upon with horrour and amazement it being not possible that those things should be done by any humane Power The Histories therefore and Writings of all Nations and even of the Heathens themselves are full of examples of the  Devils  Apparitions and of their strange effects Now he says if there ware any  Daemons  as it cannot be denied it follows that there is a Deity above them which so restrains them that they  shall not overthrow all things by their might for they have strength and malice enough to do it  He adds beneath The publick profession of  Magical Arts  which has been sometime tolerated in some of the most famous Universities of Christendom the common distinction of black and white Magick which has been invented by some excellent Philosophers of the Sects of  Plato  and  Pythagoras  who would have found a way by which they might have subjected the good  Daemons  to them and reconcile them to themselves and which has from them past to the  Jewish Cabalists  and from them to the  Christians  are an invincible Argument that there are  Magicians  and  Daemons  The certain and averred Relations of the  Northern Countries  and of both the  Indies  do testify that all those do swarm with them and that there is scarce one which has not his  Daemon  and  Familiar Spirit  So far  Capellus    To give some account now of the Magick and communion with Spirits practised in the  Northern Countries Shefferus  Professor of Law at  Upsal  in  Sweden  has writ an History of  Lapland  which was Printed in  English  at  Oxford An  and in his Eleventh Chapter which is concerning the Magical Ceremonies of the  Laplanders  he writes as follows  It has been the received Opinion among all that have known the Name of the  Laplanders  that they are a People addicted to  Magick  This Judgment of Historians concerning the  Laplanders  is no less verified of the  Biarmi  their Predecessors so that we may justly suppose both of them to have descended from the same original for the  Biarmi  were so expert  in these Arts that they could either by their Looks Words or some other wicked Artifice so ensnare and bewitch Men as to deprive them of the use of Limbs and Reason and very often to bring them into extream danger of their Lives but though in these latter times they do not so frequently practice this and dare not profess it so publickly as before yet there are still many that give themselves wholly to this Study for every one thinks it the surest way to defend himself from the injuries and malicious designs of others And they commonly profess that their knowledge of these things is absolutely necessary for their own Security upon which account they have Teachers and Professors in this Science and Parents in their last Wills bequeath to their Children as the greatest part of their Estate those Spirits and Devils that have been any way serviceable to them in their life time And  Sturlsonius  gives an account of the most Famous  Laplanders  of that Profession and though some arrive at a greater knowledge in this Profession and are more able Masters to teach it than others yet it's very seldom but the Parents themselves are so learned as to perform the duty and save the expences of a Tutor According to an aptness of disposition in Learning some arrive at a greater perfection in this Art than others who may be excellently qualified for other Imployments  As to their bequeathing their  Familiars  to their Children they suppose it the only means to raise their Family So that they excel one another in this Art according to the largeness of the Legacies they receive Thus each House has its peculiar  Spirits and of different and quite contrary natures from those of others And not only each distinct Family but single Persons in them also have their peculiar Spirits sometimes one two or more according as they intend to stand on the defensive part or are maliciously inclined and design to be upon the offensive but there is a set number of obsequious Spirits beyond which no one has and some of these will not engage themselves without great sollicitation and earnest entreaties when others readily proffer themselves to little Children when they find them fit for their turn So that divers of the Inhabitants are almost naturally  Magicians  for when the Devil takes a liking to any Person in his Infancy as a fit Instrument for his designs he presently seizes on him with a Disease in which he haunts him with several Apparitions from whence according to the capacity of his Years and Understanding he learns what belongs to the Art Those which are taken thus a second time see more Visions and gain greater knowledge If they are seized a third time which is seldom without great torment or utmost danger of their Life the Devil appears to them in all his shapes by which they arrive to the very perfection of this Art and become so knowing that without the  Drum  they can see things at great distances and are so possest by the Devil that they see them even against their will For instance not long since a certain  Lap  who is yet alive upon my complaining against him for his  Drum  brought it to me and confest with Tears that though he should part with it and not make him another he should have  the same Visions he had formerly and he instanced in my self giving me a true and particular relation of whatever had happened to me in my Journey to  Lapland  and he farther complained that he knew not how to make use of his Eyes since things altogether distant were present to him  As for their  Magick Art  it's according to the diversity of Instruments they make use of in it divided into two Parts one comprehends all that to which their  Drum  belongs the other those things to which  Knots Darts Spells Conjurations  and the like refer Concerning their  Drum  it's made of an hollow Piece of Wood and must be either of  Pine Firre  or  Birchtree  which grows in such a particular place and turns directly according to the Suns Course which is when the grain of the Wood turning from the bottom to the top of the Tree winds it self from the right hand to the left from this perhaps they believe the Tree very acceptable to the Sun which under the Image of  Thor  they Worship with all imaginable Adoration The Piece of Wood they make it of is the Root cleft asunder and made hollow on one side upon which they stretch a Skin the other side being convex is the lower Part in which they make two Holes where they put their Fingers to hold it The shape of the upper side is Oval and in Diameter about half an Ell It's like a  Kettledrum  but not altogether so round nor so hollow and the Skin is fasten'd with Wooden Pegs some are sewed with the Sinews of  Rain Dear  They Paint upon the Skin several Pictures in red stain'd with the Bark of an  Aldertree  As for the particular Pictures of these  Drums  I refer  you to the Author They put a Bunch of  Brass Rings  on the Drum when they beat them Several of the  Drums  have not the same Pictures upon them They have the Pictures of several Animals on their  Drums  to signifie when and in what place they may find them If a  Rain Dear  be lost how they may get him again whether the  Rain Dears  Young ones will live whether their Fishing will be successful if Sick Men will recover or not whether Women great with Child shall have a safe delivery or such or such a Man shall die of such a Distemper or of what other and other things of the like Nature which they are desirous to know He says he can give no Account of the Reason for the Difference in their  Drums  unless it be that some of them are made for more malicious Designs others again for each Man's private Purpose On this Account he believes according to the Nature of the Business they intend they add and blot out and sometimes wholly change the Figures  There are two things requir'd to fit a  Drum  for use  an Index  and  an Hammer  The first shews among the Pictures that thing they enquire after with the  Hammer  they beat the  Drum  The Index is the  bunch of Brass Rings  before mention'd They first place one great Ring upon the  Drum  then they hang several small ones upon that the shape of the  Index  is very different he had one of  Copper  of the bigness of a  Dollar  with a square hole in the middle and several small Chains hanging about it instead of  Rings  Another has an  Alchimyring  on which a small round plate of  Copper  is hang by little Chains he had seen another of  Bone in shape of the  Greek  Δ with rings above it and others of a quite different make As he has giv'n here Cutts of several  Drums  so he has of the  Indexes  and  Rings  some Writers call those  Rings Serpents  or  Brazen Frogs  and  Toads  not that they resemble them but because by them they signifie these Creatures whose Pictures they often make use of in their Conjuring as supposing them very grateful and acceptable to the Devil They make the  Index  indifferently of any sort of Metal The Hammer they use in raising their  Familiars  as for the Head of it it's made of  RainDears Horn  the other part serves for the Handle and he has given us two Cuts of the  Hammers  with this  Hammer  they beat the  Drum  not so much to make a noise as by drumming to move the ring lying on the Skin so as to pass over the Pictures and shew what they seek after This is the Description of the  Drum  with all its Necessaries as it's us'd by the  Laplanders  that are Subject to  Sweden  The  Finlaps  also that are under the Crown of  Denmark  make use of  Drums  though somewhat different in their make from the former however he conceives them not of a different kind but made for some particular uses The  Laplanders  use their  Drums  for divers Designs and are of Opinion that what ever they do is done by the help of it and therefore they keep it very choicly with the  Index  and  Hammer    There are three very strange things which they believe they can effect by their  Drum  and these belonging either to their Hunting their Sacred Affairs or lastly their enquiring into things far distant he finds four things chiefly  mention'd by another Writer the first  the knowing the State of Affairs in Foreign Countries the second what success their Designs in Hand will meet with the third how to Cure Diseases the fourth what Sacrifices their Gods will be pleas'd to accept and what Beast each God desires or dislikes most The Artists that beat the  Drums  beat not altogether in the same place but round about the  Index  they beat softly at first presently quicker and continue this till they have effected their intent The  Drummer  first lifts up the  Drum  by degrees then beats softly about the  Index  till it begins to stir and when it's remov'd some distance from its first place to either side he strikes harder till the  Index  Point at something from whence he may Collect what he look'd for both the  Drummer  and those present are upon their Knees Those who desire to know the Condition of their Friends or Affairs abroad whether or Miles distant go to some  Laplander  or  Finlander  Skilful in this Art and present him with a Linnen Garment or Piece of Silver as his reward An example of this Nature is to be seen upon Record at  Bergen  in  Norway  where the effects of the  German Masters  are registred  In this place one  John Delling  a Factor to a  German  enquired of a  Finlapper  of  Norway  about his Master in  Germany  the  Finlapper  readily assented to tell him like a Drunken Man he presently made a bawling then reeling and dancing about several times in a Circle fell at last upon the Ground lying there for some time as if he were Dead then starting up on a sudden related to him all things concerning his Master which were  afterwards found to agree to what he reported A  Laplander  also as  Schefferus  writes gave  Tornaeus  an Account of the journey he first made to  Lapland  though he never had seen him before that time which though it were true  Tornaeus  dissembled to him lest he might glory too much in his devilish Practices  Schefferus  says the Authority of this Man is so considerable that it may give Credit enough to the Story  As to the Method taken in making these Discoveries its very different  Hist Goth l    c    Olaus Magnus  describes it thus the  Drummer  goes into some private Room accompanyed by one single Person beside his Wife and beating the  Drum  moves the  Index  about muttering at the same time several Charms then presently he falls into an Extasy and lies for a short time as Dead mean while his Company takes great Care that no Gnat Fly or other Animal touch him for his Soul is carryed by some evil  Genius  into a Foreign Country from which it is brought back with some sign as a Knife or Ring as a token of his Knowledge of what is done in those Parts after this rising up he relates all the Circumstances belonging to the Business that was enquired after  Petrus Claudius  makes no mention either of the Drum Charms Company or those things he brings with him but he says he casts himself on the Ground grows Black in his Face lying as if Dead for an Hour or two according as the Distance of the place is of which he makes enquiry when he awakes he gives a full Account of all Affairs there  Samuel Rheen  in his History says The Drummer sings a Song call'd by them  Joiike  and the Men and Women that are present  sing likewise some in higher some in lower Notes this they call  Duura  As for their casting themsel  on the Ground in a Trance and what  sa  by some of their Souls parting from their Bodies  Schefferus  believes the Devil only then stifles the Faculties of the Soul for a time and hinders their Operations As the  Drummer  falls down he lays the  Drum  as near as possible on his Head Those in the mean time that are present leave not off singing all the while he lies sweating in his Agony which they do not only to put him in Mind when he awakes of the Business he was to know but also that he might recover out of his Trance which he would never do as they imagine if they either ceas'd singing or any one stirr'd with their Hand or Foot And this perhaps is the reason why they suffer no Fly nor any living Creature to touch him and watch him so diligently It's uncertain how long they may lie in their Trance but it's commonly according as the place where they make their discovery is nearer or farther of but the time never exceeds Hours let the place be at never so far a Distance As for their farther Practice with the  Drum  I refer you to the Book it self  Concerning their other Parts of  Magick  the first is a  Cord tyed with Knots  for raising of Wind  Schefferus  says he thinks it not at all probable that the  Laplanders  should be concerned in this Practice since they live in an  Inland Country  Bordering no where upon the Sea wherefore this properly belongs to the  Finlappers  of  Norway  and those that are skilled in this Art have command chiefly over the  Winds th  n blew at their Birth  now he says as this belongs  chiefly to the  Finlappers  and  Finlanders  of  Norway  so does the stopping of the Course of Ships which is altogether of the same Nature  Somewhat relating to this I find in  Nicolaus Hemmingius  who in his  Tract de Superstitionibus Magicis  printed at  Copenhaguen An  tells us That  Petrus Palladius  sometime Bishop of  Seelandt  and Professor of Divinity at  C  p  haguen  could from a Part of his Body affected foretel from what Part of the Heavens Tempests would come and was seldom deceiv'd  Next he comes to their  Magical Darts  which they make of Lead in length about a Finger by these they Execute their Revenge on their Enemies and Wound them with Cancerous Swellings either in the Arms or Legs which by the extremity of its Pain kills them in three Days time they shoot these Darts to what distance they please and seldom miss their Aim  Schefferus  thinks that both  Olaus Magnus  who writes this and  Zeigler  from whom he transcrib'd it as he has many other things are mistaken in setting down  Leaden Darts  since he finds no Person now that knows any such thing nor is there any mention made of such in any other Writers he thinks the mistake may be by misunderstanding the word  Skot  which is commonly us'd for explaining those Darts for when Man or Beast is suddenly taken with a Disease People call this that takes them so  Skot  that is a  Dart Petrus Claudius  calls it a  Gan  which they send abroad he likens it to a  Flye  but says its some little Devil of which the  Finlanders  in  Norway  that excel most in this Art keep great Numbers in a  Leather Bag  and dispatch daily some of them abroad but he seems to intimate no  more by this word  Gan  than that very thing which endangers Mens Health and Lives for he says That these  Finlanders  cannot live peaceably except they let out of their  Ganeska  or  Gankiid  which is the  Satchel  every Day one of the  Gans  that is a  Fly  or  Devil  but if the  Gan  can find no Man to Destroy after they have sent him out which they seldom do upon no Account at all then he Roves about at a venture and destroys the first thing he meets with Therefore this word  Gan  signifies no more than what  Zeigler  meant by his  Dart  for the term by which they express going out is  de Skiuda devis Gan  that is he as it were shoots out his  Gan  like an Arrow for  Skiuda  is only proper to the shooting out of an Arrow  This Magical Practice they use as well against one another as Strangers nay sometimes against those that they know are Equals in the Art Some of the Conjurers are contented only with the power to expel the  Gan  out of Men or Beasts which others send this is remarkable among them that they can hurt no Man with their  Gan  except they first know his Parents Name  Now all that the  Finlanders  and  Finlappers  of  Norway  effect by their  Gan  the  Laplanders  do by a thing they call  Tyre  This  Tyre  is a round Ball about the bigness of a WallNut or small Apple made of the finest Hair of a Beast or else of Moss very smooth and so light that it seems hollow its Colour is a mixture of Yellow Green and Ash but so that the Yellow appears most This  Tyre  they say is quicken'd and moved by a particular Art Its sold by the  Laplanders  so that he  that buys it may hurt whom he pleases with it they perswade themselves and others that by the  Tyre  they can send either Serpents Toads Mice or what they please into any Man to make his Torment the greater It goes like a Whirlwind and as swift as an Arrow and destroys the first Man or Beast that it lights on but so that it often mistakes of these we have two many Instances at this time which are too long to insert here So far  Schefferus    There are two things I shall note in reference to this Account of  Schefferus  As for Parents bequeathing to their Children their Spirits at their Deaths we find in the  Try  ls of Witches in England  that the same has been practis'd here and that some have had Spirits given them by their Parents others by other Relations and other Friends beside those which Originally came to themselves  As for  Schefferus  's particular Opinion That the  Laplanders  did not really send Darts to those they had a Mind to destroy I cannot easily agree in Opinion with him for you find before in Mr  Mather  's Account of the  Indians  in  Martha  's Vineyard in  NewEngland  that the  Indian Pawaws  were wont to form a piece of Leather like an Arrow's Head and then to tye an Hair to it and over these to use some Magical Ceremonies whereupon the  Daemon  presently snatch'd them away and convey'd them into the Bodies of Persons to be afflicted and as the  Laplanders  send their  Gans  or  Flies  to destroy Persons so Mr  Mather  says sometimes the  Daemon  pretends to the  Pawaws  that he brings a Portion of the Spirit of a Person closely imprison'd in a Fly and as they deal with the Fly so it fares with the Body of  the Person they intend to Afflict The  Drums  also us'd by the  Laplanders  are us'd by the  WestIndians  so that there is a strange Agreement in their  Magical Practices  as I shall set forth beneath  Chap    The Learned  Olaus Rudbeck  in the  Second Volume  of his  Atlantica  treats concerning the  Lapland Drums  the Heads of which he says are divided into three Parts the uppermost Region contains the Heavens and all Celestial things and all Volatiles the middle Region contains the Earth with Men and all Animals the lowermost Region contains all Infernals and Subteraneous Places and then he gives a particular Explication of all the Figures or Marks on the  Tympana  and says if the  Laplanders  would know whether when they go a hunting they shall have success they beat their  Drum  with  Thors Hammer  and diligently observe a certain Ring leaping on the  Drum  which if they see to rest on the Image of a  Ranger  they no way doubt but they shall kill a Ranger that Day if it rests on the Figure of a Wolf they conclude they shall have a Wolf for their Prey He refers us for other things relating to the use of the  Lapland Drums  to  Schefferus  's  Lapponia Olaus Magnus  and others however I shall give you here what seems to be  Olaus Rudbeck  's Sense concerning what may be expected from the Superstitious use of the  Lapland Drums  inserted by him in the Fifth Chapter of the said Book  p  it is as follows Since the Doctrine of Christ came to  Lapland  Men could not but forget many things relating to Superstition and cast off others or at least be at an uncertainty in them whether therefore  the  Laplanders  themselves are now Ignorant of the true make of the most Ancient  Drums  or whether the very differing fitting of the  Drums  deprives them of the Knowledge of a thing so extreamly vain they now suffer themselves with extream difficulty to be drawn to make known their Superstition to others perhaps also shame or fear deters some To pass by that the chief  Arcanum  of Superstition will not be Revealed be it as it may you shall now hardly find any Man who knows rightly how to manage this  Drum  or to explain it to others and those who think they know somewhat of this kind either so obstinately conceal it or so dissemble their skill that those Labour in a manner in vain who with any Gifts how great soever or high drinking which is wont to go a great way with them otherwise endeavour to break or Conquer that silence but among Gifts if any Man will purchase this Art of them the  Laplanders  are earnest Lovers of  Imperial RixDollars    In the Sixth Chapter of his said  Second Volume  he tells us of wonderful Performances said to have been wrought by the means of their  Scipio Runicus  or  Runstaffe  by us call'd the  Runick Almanack  of which there are many in  England  being anointed with a certain Magical Ointment  viz  of Mens flying in the Air on it and the like and says a more constant Fame of nothing has remain'd in their Country from the remotest times of  Paganism  than of such flights in the Air and that nothing is more readily believed than that the present  Laplanders  who continue still in  Paganism  use the same kind of flights now and that beside  Runstaff  's  Sticks Pales Calves  Horses Dogs  and other living Creatures anointed with the same kind of Ointment were thought to be able to carry their Riders to Places design'd and these things were wont to be ascrib'd to  Diana  or  Disa  as the first Inventress of them  He here tells us also That the  Tympanum  of the Mother of the Gods so much celebrated by the  Greeks  and  Latine  Writers though explain'd by none of them as it ought was nothing but a Copy of the  Lapland Tympanum  convey'd to Foreign Parts by  Disa Isis Idaea  or  Diana  whose  Ring  and  Hammer  were sometime found in the left Hand of the Figure of  Isis  at  Rome  the  Tympanum  it self being over the Head of the Goddess and there being Marks under her Feet like to those that are seen in the  Lapland Drums  The  Egyptian Isis  also according to a Cut giv'n of her by  Pignorius  holds this  Ring  and  Hammer  in her left Hand And the Mother of the Gods as  Du Choul  has set forth handles a  Tympanum  and he says he will make out in his  Chronology  that  Isis  the Daughter of  Inachus  going into  Egypt  a little before the times of  Moses  taught the  Egyptians  Incantations and withal shew'd them that Infamous use of the Hieroglyphical Marks with which Art the  Egyptian Magi  afterwards contended with  Moses  before  Pharoah  But he does not think that all the  Goths  were giv'n to those Arts because the Testimonies of the  S  lds  and of  Snorro  himself free the most Valiant of the  Goths  from that Infamy those Arts being beneath their Valour and Dignity and seem'd much to prejudice the Fame and Renown due to Valiant Men and therefore great Punishments was never inflicted on Men giv'n to such Arts by Magnanimous Kings  I must here note That notwithstanding all this Discourse concerning  Thor  's  Hammer  and its being convey'd from  Sweden  to foreign Parts given us by the Learned  Rudbeck  I must wholly yield to what the Learned  Kircher  in his  Obeliscus Pamphilius  has delivered us concerning it he has there writ a Paragraph with this Title to it  Concerning the Tautick Character or the Cross with an H  ndle to it  that is a Ring annext to the top of it  the chief of all the Hierogliphicks  this being the same with what  Rudbeck  calls  Thor  's  Hammer    Kircher  there among other curious things tells us that the  Egyptians  in the Character  T Tau  as in a LookingGlass plac'd the Idea of the whole Pantomorphous Nature by the Circle or Ring which they commonly place on the top of it they denoted the Celestial Orbs in which the Spirit of the World mixes it self first communicating its Virtue to them by the Cross the virtue of the four Elements on the Sublunary World through the mediation of the Celestial Bodies from which the generation of all things arises for they observed there were two motions chiefly appearing in Nature  viz  a Strait and a Circular one they represented this by a Circle the other by Strait Lines for the Elements being moved out of their natural places they found by experience they return'd to them but by Strait Lines  and beneath  he quotes the following Passage from  Ficinus  's Third Book  De vitâ Caelestus Comparendâ    The  A  gyptians  preferr'd the Figure of the Cross before all others because Bodies  ct by the vertue diffused to the Superficies now the first Superficies is described  by the Cross for so it has chiefly Longitude and Latitude and this is the first Figure and the straitest of all and contains four Strait Angles now the effects of the Celestial Bodies chiefly result from the Rectitude of the Rays and Angles for then Stars are most powerful when they hold the four Angles of Heaven  viz  the Points of the East and West and of the mid Heaven on either side and being so disposed they so cast their Rays against each other that they thence make a Cross the Ancients therefore said the Cross was a Figure made of the fortitude of the Stars and the Suscepticle of their fortitude and therefore it had a mighty power in  Images  and received the Powers of the Spirits and Planets  T  m    part    p    The same Author in his  Oedipus Aegypt  says The  Crux Ansata  or  Isiaca  is seen carried almost in every  Images  Hand of the  Aegyptians  which Character they had in so great Veneration that they thought nothing could be rightly done without it and it was the most powerful  Amulet  and a Character made by a wonderful Subtlety of Wit according to the pattern of Nature the only guide and light to show the way to Happiness  Ib Tom    p    Again he tells us elsewhere That by the  Crux Ansata  which consisted of a Circle and a Cross they denoted the motion of  Phtha viz  the Soul of the World artificially disposing all things that are in the World and by the Circle the circular motion of the Celestial Bodies whereby it in some sort animates them and renders them apt for influencing Inferiours and by the Cross or the lines cutting each other they signify the motion which it  performs in the Inferior World for the Generation and Production of things according to the nature of Elementary Bodies for the motion of Sublunary things is according to strait Lines as it appears in the motion of Light and Heavy things and of such as are of a middle Nature whereof those being carried some upwards some downwards according to Strait Lines these participating equally of Gravity and Levity having got a middle Nature and diffus'd as it were on the sides appositely express the cut Lines of a Cross and therefore by this only Character for the said reasons they do not unmeetly denote the whole process of Nature wherefore also they reputed this Character as the most Mysterious of all Hierogliphicks and thought the same had the greatest force of all both to allure  Good Genii  and facinate the Evil ones hence calling it the Symbol of Health the greatest Spell the Monogram  Phtha  and by other Names they had it put in all  Obelisks Statues Tables  c  Here we find a pretty satisfactory Account of the Original Institution of this Character which I cannot find in the the Works of the Learned  Rudbeck  and therefore as far as it appears to me hitherto I must conclude it of an  Aegyptian  Original  To proceed now to some further account from  Olaus Rudbeck  in reference to Magical Practices in his  d  Vol  he tells us when we find any strange Relation in that kind we ought duly to weigh what is really perform'd by the  Magick Art  and what contains some abstruse sense and is proposed translatitiously and by way of  Aenigma  he says it's a firm Argument with him for the practice  of  Witchcraft  and  Horrible Magick  in the North that Men came thither at the same time from  Greece Aegypt  and  Phaenicia  as to a famous  Academy  and gave themselves over wholly to the study of those Arts and that  Pythagoras  was not the only Man that learnt to Fly of the  Hyperborean Abaris  but others of the same Age as we find from  Diogenes  in  Photius  viz  Carmanus Cylla Dercyllis  c who thinking themselves in  Thule  on a sudden awaking as it were from a Dream found themselves in the  Temple of Hercules  at  Tyre  And the Author setting down some of their chief Customs agreeing with what the  Greeks  and  Latins  write tells us that the  Golden Apples  raising the Gods themselves from Death to Life that is which set forth the Acts of their Ancestors encouragements to Vertue and determents from Vice are interpreted by him Letters which were cut on Stones or Wood or writ on Parchment and those Stones Tables Parchments and  Lapland Tympana  from their Oblong Figure got the name of  Pineapples Apples  and  Eggs  and those Letters which were writ on Parchment or  Magical Tampana  were done over with a Gold Colour drawn from the Bark of an Alder which Alder was much esteemed by their Ancestors and is now by the  Laplanders  because from its inward Bark chew'd with the Teeth they get that Gold Colour wherewith they Paint all kinds of Letters and Figures on their  Tympana  And as for its being said that some descended into Hell being carried on  Alder Sticks  it's on this account that in their Divinations they used such Sticks in the Barks of which Letters and Circles were Cut compassing about the  Stick like the various spires of Serpents As for the God they call upon in their Divinations he says its  Saturn  and his Worshippers using the  Drums  are called  Saturnines  Therefore he that by the help of the  Drum  would seek Counsel of the Gods takes in one Hand a  Golden Apple  in the other an  Hammer  made like a  Cross  of Alder or Horn and has also a  Serpent  made of Copper and not much differing from Gold in Colour which upon the beat of the  Hammer  on the Head of the  Drum  leaps in and out till it settles on some Letter or Figure shewing that to be it from whence the Answer is given moreover the  Saturnine  upon beating the  Drum  a while fell into a Trance as tho' he were Dead and the  Laplanders  by mistake then thought the Soul went out of the Body and after having learnt many things return'd again whereas their Ancestors with  Plutarch  thought the Soul did not go out of the Body but yielded for some time and gave a loose to the  Genius  which having rov'd about told it inwardly many things which it had seen and heard without Now the things they desire to see are of various kinds either the Soul of the Dead or the Actions of Men at a great distance or past or future things and he gives instances of some eminent Persons who came from other Countries to theirs to see the Ghosts of their Ancestors raised after this manner and  Plato  owns that all the Tradition concerning the  Elisian Fields  and  Hell  owes its rise to their North which being cut on a  Table of Brass  was carried by  Ops  from the  Hyp  rb  reans  to  Delos  belonging to the  Greeks    In his Tenth Chapter of his said Third Vol speaking of their  Cumae  which lies beyond the  Baltick  overagainst  Phlaegra  he says it was known formerly for  Horrible Magick  and the Imposture of  Witches  where  Ulysses  and  A  neas  were seduced consulting the old Fatetelling  Cumaean Sibyl  call'd the  Prophetess of Hell  because she lived in the remotest part North as it were in a Subteraneous place this  Sibyl  being different from the  Cumane Sibyl  in  Italy  nay and he here tells us it is to be noted that whatsoever of the  Magick Art  and Natural Science is ascribed to the  Antediluvian Giants  by  Syncellus  and others all this both the  Greek Histories  and those of their Country unanimously ascribe to the North  In his Twelfth Chapter of the same Volume he tells us that  Thor  amongst other Names given him was called  FlugeGuden  the God of  Flies  driving away Magical Flies with his  Hammer  he being the same with  Belzebub  mentioned in the Scripture  As for the  Magical Flies  they were  Daemons  in the shape of  Blue Flies  which the  Finlanders  kept in a  Magical Pouch  or  Satchel  they being called by them  Gan  that is Spirits which they daily sent forth for their  Magical  purposes  viz  to bring them News from all parts of the Universe and to do things destructive to Men  c  and these  Flies  were driven away by Sacrifices to  Thor  tho' the Victims offer'd by the  Jews  at the Temple of  Hierusalem  were freed from  Flies  by reason of the  Jews  Faith in God  I thought fit to subjoyn this account from  Olaus Rudbeck  to that of  Schefferus  they both relating to  Magical Practices  and giving some light to each other  I may here acquaint the Reader that  Olaus Rudbeck  Son to the Famous  Olaus  before quoted was deputed  Anno  by the late King of  Sweden Charles  XI to Travel through the Northern Provinces of  Sweden  viz  Lapland Finland  c to Write a Natural History of them giving an Account of things peculiar to those Countries  viz  the  Plants  and  Flowers Stones Metals Quadrupes Birds Fish  c and  Anno  he Printed a First Part of this intended Account at  Upsal  in  Quarto  the General Title of the Work being  Lapponia Illustrata  and the particular Title of this First Part being  Iter per Uplandiam  In his General Title Page he says he shall set forth in his Work the Scituation of each of the Countries he there Names and the  Genius  of the Inhabitants but chiefly both the Habit of Body and Disposition of Mind of the  Laplanders  their Religion Manners Language way of Converse and their first Origin beside the account of their Annimals Minerals Mountains Woods Lakes Rivers Cataracts  c  so that as he designs to divide this Work into several Parts we may hope in one of them to have as accurate an Account as may be of their  Magical Practices  and Superstitions  Having intimated before the Magical use of  Drums  with other Superstitious Practises in the  WestIndies  I shall give you here what Mr  Wafer  in his Description of the  Isthmus  of  Darien  Printed  Anno  writes of it which is thus We enquir'd of the  Indians  when they expected any Ships who said they knew not but would enquire concerning it and thereupon sent for some of their  Pawaws  or Conjurers who came and went into an Apartment  by themselves stay'd for some time at their Exercise and he and his Companions could hear them make most hideous Yellings and Shrieks imitating the Voices of all their Birds and Beasts With their own Noise they join'd that of several Stones struck together and of  ConchShells  and of a sort of  Drums  made of hollow  Bamboes  which they beat upon making also a jarring Noise with Strings fasten'd to the larger Bones of Beasts and every now and then they would make a dreadful exclamation and clattering all of a sudden and as suddenly make a pause with a profound silence But finding that after a considerable time no Answer was made them they concluded that 'twas because we were in the House and so turn'd us out and went to work again but still finding no return after an Hour or two more they made a search in our Apartment and finding some of our Cloaths hanging up in a Basket against the Wall they threw them out of Doors in a great disdain then they fell once more to their  Pawawing  and after a little time they came out with their Answer but all in a muck Sweat so they first went down to the River and wash'd themselves and then came and deliver'd the Oracle to us which was to this effect That from the tenth Day from that time there would arrive two Ships and that in the Morning of the tenth Day we should hear first one Gun and some time after another that one of us should die soon after at that going aboard we should lose one of our Guns all which things fell out exactly according to the Prediction  A Person who has spent many Years in  Voyages has also told me that he has seen  Drums  us'd in  America  particularly at  Dominico  where the  Indians  use them to  Pawaw  with for causing Rain or fair Weather but those  Drums  have no Characters on them they beat them with Sticks and have some little piece of Iron or Stone on the Head loose which plays while they are beating they utter also many words all the while they are beating and speak very loud The same Person acquainted me that he saw in  Norway  near  Yarpin  an Artist beat a  Drum  like a  Lapland Drum  with two Sticks and he observ'd his  Lips  to move all the while he beat thereon above a quarter of an Hour till he was all in a Sweat and then he fell into a Trance in which he lay above half an Hour or near three quarters and upon his coming to himself he answer'd the Question had been propos'd to him  Concerning these Diabolical Extasies Mr  Pereaud  in the seventh Chapter of his  Demonology  prefixt to his  Antidaemon of Mascon  printed in  French  at  Geneva An  writes thus The Devil causes Witches sometimes to fall into Extasies in the Daytime causing in their Bodies a destruction of their Spirits and Sense for some time so that a Man would say their Soul were out of their Body and then he puts lively Impressions of things into them while they are in this Preternatual sleep their Souls being as it were retreated into themselves and so fixt by the Devil to the Fancies and Illusions wherewith he amuses them that they firmly believe by this Imagination thus lively impress'd that they have done themselves what the Devil represented to them by such Imaginations  There are many Histories of these Diabolical Extasies but I shall content my self in alledging one and so much the rather because it happen'd in my time in the Country of  Vaux  about the Year as I have been assur'd by very Credible Persons There was at that time and in that place a Bailiff of  Berne  who having one Day invited the Minister of the said place to Dinner and being at Table they came to a Discourse of Witches occasion'd by the then Confinement of one as a Prisoner in the Castle of  Echalens  where they were and which Prisoner was already Condemn'd to Die for the Crime of Witchcraft and was in a short time to be Executed as he really was This Bailiff spake his Mind freely to the Minister his Pastor concerning many things which this Witch confess'd to have done and which he had a difficulty to believe it possible for him to do and hereupon being risen from Table the Bailiff went to the Prison and brought the Prisoner and having spoken to him among other things concerning the Confessions he had made and of his Condemnation following thereupon he Courteously told him that he should consider well whether he had not done himself injury in having confess'd things that he had not done minding him of some of those things in particular hereupon the Prisoner who was already dispos'd to die seriously told him that what he had said and confess'd was really true and that for Proof of this if he pleas'd to permit him he would kill the Cattle of a Neighbour whom he nam'd so he had his Box and his Stick which were at his House in a place which he  nam'd hereupon the Bailiff willing to satisfie his Curiosity resolv'd to send for this Stick and Box resolving also to pay for the Cattle to whom they belong'd The Stick and Box being brought were put into the Witch's Hands who in the Presence of the Bailiff the Minister and some others perform'd all the Ceremonies that other Witches are wont to use with those Instruments of Satan till he fell as Dead at their Feet without any Motion or Sense till about an Hour or three Quarters after he came to himself as from Death to Life or as from a most profound Sleep and then being ask'd by the Bailiff whence he came He said he came from killing the Cattle which he had mention'd to him and according to the leave he had giv'n him presently the Bailiff sent to know whether this were true and the Cattle were found really Dead as he had said  Mr  Pereaud  adds The Question is who then kill'd the Cattle it could not be the Witch his Body continued always in the Presence of the Bailiff and others to say that he went in his Soul separated from the Body this cannot be for Reasons which he gives It follows then it was the Devil himself that did it having wrought in the mean time so powerfully on the Imagination of the Witch that he believ'd it was done by himself  Paracelsus  has another way of explaining these things  Tom    c    prob in Scien Divi paragr    which I shall leave to the Readers Consideration it is as follows The Constellation of a Man may be so great in its thought that in a Man's sleep it may send his Sydereal Spirit to another place without the aid of the Elementary Body that Astral Body has a  Power of infecting with Poison weakning distorting blinding beating killing and inspiring and that in a Moment and afterward of returning to its Elementary Body And its a thing very well known that the Ancients through a strong Imagination by the force of the Astral Body attempted and perform'd many things of this kind against their Enemies so that some on a sudden have been rendred Paralitical no Natural Cause concurring some depriv'd of their Sight some made Leprous some Strangl'd These and the like Evils have been inflicted which could scarce be cur'd again in a very long time Therefore let those Physicians who meet with such Diseases know that neither the Elements nor Nature it self breeds them but that they were the Works of the sole Syderea Body of others and these things are caus'd in Dreams when this or that Man Dreams such a thing therefore according to this Dream judge of the Disease of others  He adds beneath Though the Body So  and Spirit are not together at the same time yet the thought and Speculation or Imagination remains still in the Spirit wherefore they are often seen with such kinds of Thoughts Since therefore the thought of a Man is of such a Nature therefore by the Sydereal Spirit that thing is so express'd and signified by a Dream according as one Spirit is dispos'd to another before he be consumed nor is this only so but also in Mountains and Woody Places and in the Alps a great Number of these Sydereal Spirits have been sometimes seen which have hurt Cattle and other Creatures because the Sydereal Spirits of some maintain'd an hatred and executed a  Revenge after Death against th  se Neighbours whose Cattle they were  The following Relation concerning an admirable Performance of Persons who cast themselves into a Trance is no less stranger  Frommannus  in his Tract  de Fascia  tione Magica part    c  quotes  M  iolus  writing thus No less admirable is that Judgment of seven Magicians which I learnt at  Nantes An    when therefore they had took upon them to tell within a little space what was done ten Miles round they presently fell all down as Dead and lay so for three Hours and then arising they told whatsoever they had seen done in the whole Town of  Nantes  and in the Country round about it to a good Distance the Places  acts and Men being observ'd all which  hings upon enquiry were found true therefore all of them being accus'd and found Guilty of many Malefices were condemn'd to the Fire  Purchas  in his Extracts from  Gonzalo Ferdi  ando Ovido    P    l    c    his Summary and General History of the  Indi  s  writes thus Before the Inhabitants of  Hispaniola  had receiv'd the Christian Faith there was among them a Sect of Men who liv'd solitarily in the D  sarts and led their Life in Silence and Abstinence more strictly than the  Pythagore  ns  abstaining in like manner from all things that liv'd of Blood contented only with Fruits Herbs and Roots which the Desarts afforded them  Professors of this Sect being call'd  Pi  ces  they apply'd themselves to the Knowledge of Natural things and us'd certain Secret Magical Operations and Superstitions whereby they had a Familiarity with Spirits which they allur'd into their Bodies at such time as they would take upon them to tell of things to come  which they did as follows When any of the Kings sent for any of them out of the Desarts for this purpose the  Piaces  comes with two of his Disciples waiting on him of whom one brings with him a Vessel of a Secret Water and the other a little Silver Bell when he comes to the place he sits down on a round Stool made for him on purpose one of his Disciples standing on one Hand of him and the other on the other in the Presence of the King and certain of his chief Retinue for the common People are not admitted to these Mysteries and turning his Face toward the Desart he begins his Incantations and calls the Spirit with a loud Voice by certain Names which no Man understands but himself and his Disciples After he has done this a while if the Spirit deferrs his coming he drinks of the said Water and therewith grows Hot and Furious and inverts and turns his Inchantment and lets himself Blood with a Thorn strangely turmoiling himself as we read of the furious  Sibyls  not ceasing till the Spirit comes who presently overturns him as a Greyhound overturns a Squiril then for a while he seems to lie as though he were in great Pain or in a Rapture wonderfully tormenting himself during which Agony one of his Disciples shakes the Silver Bell continually when the Agony is over and he lies quiet though without any Sense or Feeling the King or some other in his stead asks of him what he desires to know and the Spirit Answers him by the Mouth of the rapt  Piaces  with a direct and perfect Answer to all Points On a time a certain  Spaniard  being present at those Mysteries with one of the Kings and  in the Spanish Tongue asking the  Piaces  concerning certain Ships which they look'd for out of  Spain  the Spirit answer'd in the  Indian  Tongue and told them what Day and Hour the Ship departed from  Spain  how many they were and what they brought without failing in any Point If he be ask'd concerning the Eclipse of the Sun or Moon which they greatly fear and abhor he gives a perfect answer and the like of Tempests Famine Plenty War or Peace and such other things When all Questions are over his Disciples call him aloud ringing the Silver Bell at his Ear and blowing a certain Powder into his Nostrils whereby he is raised as it were from a Dead sleep being yet somewhat heavy headed and faint for a good while after Since the Christian Faith has been dispersed through this  Island  those Diabolical Practices have ceas'd  The same Author from the Fifth Book of  Jos  phus Acasta    Part    l    c    speaking of the  WestIndians  of  Mexico  writes as follows  When the Priests went to Sacrifice and give Incense in the Mountains or on the tops thereof or in any dark and obscure Caves where their Idols were they us'd a certain Ointment doing certain Ceremonies to take away fear and to give them Courage This Unction was made with divers little Venemous Beasts as  Spiders Scorpions Palmers Salamanders  and  Vipers  To make an Ointment of these Beasts they took them altogether and burnt them on the Hearth of the Temple which was before the Altar till they were consum'd to Ashes then they put them in Mortars with much Tobacco which Herb they much us'd to Benumb the Flesh that they might not feel  their Travail with which they mingle the Ashes making them to lose their force they likewise mingl'd with these Ashes  Scorpions Spiders  and  P  lmers  alive then they put to it a certain Seed being ground which they call'd  Ololuch  ui  whereof the  Indians  make a Drink to see Visions the Vertue of this Herb being to deprive a Man of Sense They likewise ground with these Ashes  Black  and  iry  rms  whose Hair only is Venemous all which they mingled together with the Black or the fume of Rosin and put it in small Pots which they set before their God saying it was his Meat and therefore they called it a Divine Meat by means of this Ointment they became Witches and saw and spake with the Devil The Priests being slubber'd with this Ointment lost all fear putting on a Spirit of Cruelty by reason whereof they very boldly kill'd Men in their Sacrifices going all alone in the Night to the Mountains and into obscure Caves contemning all Wild Beasts and holding it for certain and approv'd that  Lions Tigers Serpents  and other Furious Beasts which bred in the Mountains and Forests fled from them by the Vertue of this Tobacco of their God  Ibid  The same Author tells us There is a kind of  Sorcerers  among the  Indians  allow'd by the Kings or  ngu  's who take upon them what form and figure they please flying far through the Air in a short time beholding all that is done they talk with the Devil who answers them in certain Stones or other things which they Reverence much they tell what has pass'd in the farthest Parts before any News can come as it has chanc'd since the  Spaniards  arrived  there that in the Distance of two or three Hundred Leagues they have known the Mutinies Battles Rebellions and Deaths both of Tyrants and of those of the Kings Party and of private Men which have been known the same Day they happen'd or the Day after a thing impossible by the Course of Nature To work this Divination they shut themselves into a House and became drunk till they lost their Senses a Day after they answer'd to what was demanded some affirm they use certain Unctions The  Indians  say their Old Women commonly use this Office of Witchcraft and especially those of one Province which they call  Coaillo  and of another Town they call'd  Manchey  and of the Province of  Gutirochivi  They likewise shew what is become of things stoln and lost there are of these kinds of Sorcerers in all Parts they tell of the Success of things pass'd or to come whether Voyages shall be Prosperous whether a Man shall be Sick or shall Die or return safe or shall obtain that he pretends to they give their Answers yea or no having first spoke with the Devil in an obscure place so as the Enquirers hear the sound of the Voice but see not to whom these Conjurers speak neither do they understand what they say they make a thousand of Ceremonies and Sacrifices to this effect and grow exceeding Drunk for doing whereof they particularly use an Herb call'd  Villea  the Juice whereof they mingle with their  Chica  or take it in some other sort  The same Author  P    l    c    from the  Journal  of  William de Rubruquis  a  French Minorite Friar  concerning his Travels into the Eastern parts of the World  An  tells us That when the  Cham  of  EastTartary  purposed to do any thing he caused Three  Shoulder Bones of Ramms  to be brought him and holding them in his Hands he thought of the thing whereof he would Consult whether he might do it or not and then delivered the Bones to be Burnt when they were burnt Black they brought them to him then he lookt upon them whether the Bones by the Heat of the Fire were Cleft right length ways if so he might do it but if the Bones were Crackt athwart or round pieces were flown out of them then he did not proceed for that Bone is always Cleft in the Fire or the thin Skin which overspreads it and if one of the three were Cleft forth right yet he did it In Mr  Jenkinson  's Voyage among the  Tartars  we may read of such Divinations So far  Purchas    Now in reference to this way of Divination a Lady now in  London  has told my self that she knew a Person in  Ireland  who by looking on the Plate Bone of a Shoulder of Mutton it being of a Sheep that belong'd to the Master of a Family would predict the whole Fate of that Family and that usually with success as to who should first Die and many other Accidents relating to them  Mr  Bedford  Minister of  Temple  Parish in  Bristol  writ a Friend of his the last Year a strange Relation of an Acquaintance of his who often conversed with Spirits and the unhappy consequences of it It is as follows  About Thirteen Years since I was acquainted with one  Thomas Jerps  a Man about Years of Age who lived with his Father at  Mangerfield  in the County  Gloucester  by  Trade a  BlackSmith  he was a very good Temper'd Man extreamly well Skilled in the Mathematical Studies which were his constant Delight  viz Arithmetick Geometry Gauging Surveying  and  Algebra  and much addicted himself to  Astronomy  at length he applied himself to  Astrology  and would sometimes Calculate Nativities and resolve Horary Questions  c  which he told me prov'd oftentimes very true but he was not satisfied with it because there was nothing in it which tended to a Mathematical Demonstration  Having not seen him for some time he came to me one Day and we being in Private ask'd me very seriously concerning the Lawfulness of conversing with Spirits and after I had given my Thoughts in the Negative and confirm'd them with the best Reasons I could he told me he had considered all those Arguments and believed they all related only to Conjuration but there was an Innocent Society with them which a Man might use if he made no contract with them did no harm by their means and was not curious to pry into hidden things and that he himself had Discoursed with them and heard them Sing  c  to his great Satisfaction and once made an offer to my self and another time to Mr  Bayly  now Minister of St  James  's in  Bristol  that if we would go with him one Night to  Kingswood Forest  we should see them and hear them both Speak and Sing and talk with them on whatsoever Subject we had a mind to and we should return very safe but neither of us had the Courage to venture I told him of the Subtlety of the Devil to delude Mankind and transform himself into an  Angel of Light but he could not believe that it was the Devil I had several conferences with him on this Subject but could never convince him In all which I never observ'd the least disorder of Mind his Discourse being very rational  I ask'd him several particulars concerning the method he used and the discourse he had had with the Spirits He told me he had a Book whose directions he followed and accordingly in the dead time of the Night he went to a cross way with a Lanthorn and Candle which were Consecrated for this purpose with several Incantations He had also a Consecrated Chalk having a mixture of several things within it and with this he used to make a Circle at what distance he thought fit within which no Spirit had power to enter after this he Invoked the Spirits by using several forms of Words some of which he told me were taken out of the Scriptures and therefore he thought them lawful The Spirits appeared accordingly to him in the shapes of little Girls about a Foot and an half high and play'd without the Circle at first he was somewhat affrighted but after some small Acquaintance he became pleased with their Company He told me they spake with a very Shrill Voice like an Ancient Woman he asked them if there were a God an Heaven and an Hell they Answered there were he asked them what oeconomy they had among themselves they told him they were divided into Three Orders that they had a Chief whose Residence was in the Air that he had several Counsellors which were placed in the form of a Globe and he in the Center which was the chiefest Order another  Order was imployed in going to and fro from thence to the Earth to carry Intelligence from the Lower Spirits according to the Directions they received from those in the Air  This Description being contrary to the account we have in Scripture of the Hierarchy of Angels made me conclude them Devils but I could never convince him He told me he bid them Sing and they went to some distance behind a Bush from whence he could hear a pleasant Consort but of such Musick of which he never heard the like and in the upper part he could hear something very harsh and shrill like a Reed but as it was managed gave a particular Grace to all the rest  About a Quarter of a Year after this he came to me again and told me he wished now he had taken my Advice for he thought he had done that which would cost him his Life and his Eyes and Countenance shew'd a great alteration I asked him what he had done he told me that being Bewitch'd by his Acquaintance he resolved to proceed farther in this Art and to have some Familiar Spirits at his Command according to the directions of his Book which were to get a Book made of Virgin Parchment and Consecrated with several Incantations as also particular Ink Inkhorn Pens  c  for this purpose with these he was to go out as usual to a Crossway call upon a Spirit and ask him his Name which he was to enter in the First Page of his Book and this was to be his Chief Familiar Thus he was to do by as many as he pleased Writing their Names in  distinct Pages only one in a Leaf and then whenever he took the Book and opened it the first whose Name presented should appear his Chief Familiar he said was called  Malchi  after he had done this they appear'd to him faster than he desired and in most Dismal Shapes as of Serpents Lions Bears  c  and hist at him and attempted to throw Spears and Balls of Fire he was very much Affrighted and the more because he found it not in his power to Lay them insomuch that his Hair stood an end and he expected every moment to be Torn in Pieces This was in  December  about Midnight when he continued there in a Sweat till break of Day at which time they left him and from that time he was never well as long as he liv'd He always said he never made any Compacts with any of these Spirits nor ever did any Harm by their means nor pry'd into Future Concerns relating to himself or others and exprest an hearty Repentance for his Sin  A farther account of this Matter may perhaps be had from his Relations or Neighbours in  Mangerfield  in  Gloucestershire  not above a Mile out of the Road betwixt  Bristol  and  Bath    I formerly gave an Account of this Affair to the late Bishop of  Hereford  in which probably there are some things contain'd which I do not now remember and which perhaps may be procured from his Lady now living near  Gloucester  which Account would be more Authentick So far Mr  Bedford    Janus Mattheus  an  Italian  Physician Printed a Book of  Problems  at  Venice Anno  The First  Problem  there treated is this Whether  there are  Daemons  and whether they are the causes of Diseases according to the Opinions of Divines Philosophers and Physicians In the Third Book of this  Problem  he gives us a Relation much like the foregoing Relation of Mr  Bedford  and says he had it from many Persons worthy of Credit and from the Author of the thing himself It is as follows  After the Death of  Julius Albertus  a Lawyer a certain Friend of mine a Lawyer also seized on a certain  Necromantick  Book which had been kept in a Box of the said  Albert  having got it into his possession he presently return'd into a Mountain where his Wife was Born before the discovery of the Theft there he Lived a long time and Died never having tried the Power of the Book he being wholly Ignorant of the Magick Art but on a day unwarily whisper'd out something concerning its Magical Power to his only Son named  Arrivabenus  my familiar Acquaintance his Father being Dead and he having Married a Rich Wife was drawn by some false Companions into the Fallacious Practice of Chymistry and when after a while he had spent much of his Wives Fortune and almost all of his Paternal Estate in Chymical Practices to no purpose he lights on a day on a certain  German  Traveller who was Skilful in the Art of Chymistry whom he carried to his House and they there try'd Chymical Experiments together a long time but still in vain whereupon at length he discover'd to the  German  that he had a Magical Book and shew'd it him but with engagement of Secresy the  German  considering the Book said to him pray let us try whether this Book contains  Truth or Dreams and on an appointed Day  Arrivabenus  took with him the Book and a Sword the  German  going with him unarm'd for so it was agreed betwixt them and before Sun Rising they went into a Valley thro' which a Torrent ran and so went into a thick Wood on the left side of the Torrent in the midst of which having cut some Bushes with the Sword and made an  Area  as it was necessary presently some Ceremonies being premitted by the  German  wont to be used for such end and a large Circle being made with a Rod with certain Geometrical Figures they both enter into it Then  Arrivabenus  himself who would not deliver the Book to the  German  they having so agreed held it firmly in his Left Hand and the Sword in his Right and at the  Germans  Command open'd it which being done the  German  in the  German  Tongue called only two  Daemons  to appear in Soldiers Habits and presently with a great Wind and Noise two  Daemons  came one a Horseman with an Headpiece and a Coat of Mail and all other meet Arms and Riding on a Black Horse the other a Foot Soldier going before him girt with a Sword and having a Snapsack on his Shoulder whose Eyes shined with certain movable Flames that you would have judg'd them Colliers and would scarce have been able to look on them presently as these  Daemons  appear'd to the Men they said what do you Ask to these the  German  made an Answer and asked them many things in the  German  Tongue and received their Answers to all things in particular At length as he had commanded them to return to Hell as the  were going away  Arrivabenus  said What think you will become of our  Alchimy  to which as the  Daemon  was going to Answer begone says the  German  in the  German  Tongue Speak no more whereupon they return'd to Hell with the same Wind and Noise as they came After they were Vanished  Arrivabenus  began to Upbraid the  German  for having done Ill in hindring the Devil from giving them an Answer as to their  Alchimy  and the next day dismist him And by reason that for two Years afterwards  Arrivabenus  's Wives Uncles would not Pay him what remaind in their Hands of her Fortune as he desired because he had managed his Affairs Ill being struck with a Rage he takes his Daemonical Book and goes to the same Wood and  Area  and having performed all things but one which the  German  had done there before behold presently with the same Wind and Noise of the Trees innumerable  Daemons  with Frightful Countenances and carrying rugged Staves in their crooked Hands appear for through Rage  Arrivabenus  had forgot to command both how many and in what appearance they should come to him as the  German  had done before and stood about the Circle he had made within which the Miserable Man stood and they scar'd him with Threats and endeavoured to pull him out of the Circle all of them earnestly Asking what will you have what will you have whereupon being Frighted and beside himself and running to and fro within the Circle in an horrid Fear he fell at length out of the Circle unawares the  Daemons  then fell a Beating him pulling him here and there  and strove to take the Book from him but could not do it he having hid it in his Bosom Mean while  Arrivabenus  sometimes Running sometimes Creeping came at length to the Bridge which is over the River for he was not so far beside himself that he had quite forgot his right way but the  Daemons  threw him from the Bridge into the River so that he was nigh Suffocated in the Mud and Water now a Country Man casually driving an Ass to fetch Wood past over the Bridge where his Ass being frighted and flying back he saw  Arrivabenus  tumbling in the Mud half Dead he called to him and laying hold of his Hair drew him out of the Mud and by the help of his Ass carried him with much ado to his Wife in the Town who finding the Book in his Bosom which she had heard him speak of before she took it privately from him and had it burnt  Arrivabenus  lookt Pale and Ill ever after it tho' he Lived a long time And  Anno  upon my request freely gave me this Relation word for word I having heard of it long before from some others  Janus Mat  h  us  adds for a close Now what possibly may our great Philosophers the  Perepateticks  here Answer Truly they will either deny Instances of this kind for that they consist of Particulars which are neither known by Discipline nor by the Understanding or such things being granted they would say that these are not Histories but meer Dreams of some Melancholly Relators for certain Melancholly Persons so fixtly Dream in the Night as it sometimes happens to Lovers and Jealous Persons of those things which with a most vehement affect they Desire  hope abhor or fear in the Day that they seem most truly to see the same waking in the Day time according to that of  Averrhoes    L de Som Vig  Its no strange thing that some Man may see when awake what sleeping he did in his Dream Nay perhaps he will see the very form of the thing and not its likeness as its said of  Gaum  r  So far  Janus Matthaeus    Kircher  in his  Oedip Aegyp Tom    p  tells us That in the midst of the Subterraneous  Adyta  of the  Egyptians  there was an Altar or Table plac'd and in it the whole Concatenated Series of the  Genii  were represented by such hidden Symbols that they did not only notifie the hidden Recesses of the greatest Mysteries but they had also an infallible efficacy to make one of them which the Priests had a Mind personally to appear by horrible and execrable Adjurations and Analogons Rites and Ceremonies  There are many Relations of Houses infested with  Daemons  by Magical Practices causing Noises in them throwing Stones  c  of which I shall give only this Instance  In Epit Histor  Jo  n Cl  verius  tells us that  An  an evil Spirit infested the City of  M  ntz  and the Neighbouring Places first throwing Stones and making Noises against the Walls of the Houses and then growing troublesome to Men he began in a while to speak and to tell what things were stoln and so to sow discord among Neighbours at length he stirr'd up the Minds of all against one Man as though they suffer'd all those things for his Sins and into whatsoever House he went it presently took on Fire nor was he free in the Fields for Fruits being there heap'd together they were consum'd with Fire and when the Neighbours  for this fell upon him and were about to kill him he prov'd his Innocency by carrying a burning hot Iron in his Hands He continued acting thus for three Years till he had consum'd all the Houses with Fire  There was an Instance of this kind the last Year in  Somersetshire  at  Butley  near  Glastenbury  where lives one Mr  Pope  whose Son being about or Years of Age fell often into Fits and in his Fits said his Father's House would be Burnt by Spirits whom he sometimes saw and the House was Burnt down accordingly and a Stall with three Oxen in it and some Wheat Mows in his backside and Stones were seen to come in at the Windows in the Day time no Man perceiving from what Hand they came as a Person of  Glastenbury  told my self the last Summer at  Wells  in the said County he upon his being in the House having seen many Stones so come in at the Windows This Vexation continued a long time though now I hear it's ceas'd and the House is rebuilding There are many more particulars to be brought concerning this Fact and if any Man can make out that all these things were done by Trick and Contrivance as some say they were they may do well to satisfie the World of it  I know the late Dr  Bekker  in his Book entitled  Le monde Enchanté  laughs at all things of this Nature as done by Humane Contrivance and Mr  Scot  in his Discovery  of Witchcraft  writes thus I could recite a great Number of Tales  L    c    how Men have ev'n forsaken their Houses because of such Apparitions and Noises and all has been by meer and rank Knavery and wheresoever you shall hear  that there is in the Night Season such rumbling and fearful Noises be you well assur'd that it is flat Knavery performed by some that seem most to complain and are least suspected and hereof there is a  very Art  which for some respects I will not discover The Devil seeks daily as well as nightly whom he may Devour and can do his Feats as well by Day as by Night or else he is a Young Devil or a very Bungler  I know not what may be offer'd to Men of such obstinate Prepossessions who will have all things done by Imposture which seem strange to them and interfere with their Belief I may indulge their Humour so far that if only one Person tells a very strange Story a Man may be more apt to think it possible for that Person to lye than that so strange a Relation should be true but if a considerable number of Persons of several Countries several Religions several Professions several Ages and those Persons look'd upon to be of as great Sagacity as any the Countries afford agree in Relations of the same kind though very strange and are ready to vouch the Truth of them upon Oath after having well consider'd Circumstances I think it a violation of the Law of Nature to reject all these Relations as fabulous meerly upon a self presuming Conceit unless a Man can fairly shew the things to be Impossible or wherein those Persons were impos'd on Dr  Bekker  rejects all the Facts alledg'd for proving the Operations of  Daemons  and among others the Facts of the  Daemons  of  Mascon  and  Tedworth  as being done by Combinations of Servants or others and would have the World acquiese in his Arbitrary  say so without any manner of Proof only alledging this frivolous Pretence that there have been Impostures in that kind and therefore those must be so a notable consequence which should a SchoolBoy infer he would deserve lashing but I shall say somewhat concerning Dr  Bekker  's Work beneath it being  Instar Omnium  in its kind and therefore shall say no more of it here leaving the Facts at  Mascon  and  Tedworth  to Men of unbyass'd Thoughts to judge of them as they see cause These Relations seeming to me well attested and as well examin'd as if the Critical Dr  Bekker  had been a Party concern'd on that Account Indeed it may not be easy sometimes to discover how a thing is done by Trick tho' it be really so as the Lord  Howard  in his  Defensative against suppos'd Prophecies  c where he treats of Mens Conference with damn'd Spirits and Familiars tells us That himself was present with divers Gentlemen and Noblemen who undertook to descry the finest Sights that  Schotto  the  Italian  was able to Play by  Leger du M  in  before Queen  Elizabeth  who notwithstanding were no less beguil'd than the rest that presum'd less on their Dexterity and Skill in those Matters And nevertheless I think it may not be difficult to discern that some Facts and among others those that pass'd at  Mascon  and  Tedworth  were above all Humane Performance Mr  Scot  indeed tell us  There is a peculiar Art for doing these things which for some respects he will not discover  I suppose by this Art he does not mean a common Combination of Servants as Dr  Bekker  seems to be of Opinion it is though he presently subjoins that the Devil can shew  Tricks as well by Day as by Night intimating as though those Noises  c  only happen in Houses by Night a time favouring Impostures which is a great mistake for in the Relations of the  Daemons  of  Mascon  and  Tedworth  and that I have given before and in many other Relations of the like kind we find that many Facts pass'd in the Day time as well as by Night and that Stones have been thrown at Persons in open Fields in the Day time by an invisible Hand when many have been present And notwithstaning this pretence of an Art unless Men have an Art to make themselves invisible as  History  tells us I know not with what truth some have done I shall never believe that any Man shall be able fairly to solve the Facts we have recorded of Houses and other Places infested by any Performance of Man allowing still that there have been many Impostures in this kind and that many strange things may be performed as to the Conveyance of Voices and Sounds by a deep insight in  Acousticks  and  Phonicks    I shall not conceal here that in reference to what pass'd at  Tedworth  a Person lately told me Mr  Mompesson  own'd privately to the late King  Charles  the Second that all that pass'd at his House at  Tedworth  was done by Contrivance And another Person has told me it was done by two Young Women in the House with a design to scare thence Mr  Monpesson  's Mother this was told them by others and I found them inclin'd to a Belief of it but whoever related this unless they were obstinate Opposers of the Truth either had not seen or duly consider'd the Letter writ by Mr  Monpesson  to Mr  Glanvil Nov  the  th    nor that writ by him to Mr  Collins  one of the Booksellers that undertook the Impression of his Book it being dated  Aug  the  th  in the first mention'd of those Letters he writes thus I have been very often of late ask'd whether I have not confess'd to his Majesty or any other a Cheat discover'd about that Affair To which I gave and shall to my dying Day give the same Answer that I must belye my self and perjure my self also to acknowledge a Cheat in a thing where I am sure neither was nor could be any as my self the Minister of the Place and two other honest Gentlemen depos'd at the  Assizes  upon my impleading the  Drummer  and tho' I am sure this damnable Lye does pass for current among one sort of Persons in the World yet I Question not but the thing obtains Credit among those whom I principally desire should retain a more Charitable Opinion of me than to be any way a Deviser of it only to be talk'd of in the World to my own Disadvantage and Reproach  In his Letter to Mr  Collins  he informs him of what was depos'd upon Oath and by whom at the  Assizes  at  Sarum  concerning this Affair where he writes thus The Evidence upon Oath were  my self  one Mr  William Maton  and one Mr  Walter Dowse  all yet living and I think of as good Repute as any this Country has in it and one Mr  John Cragg  then Minister of the Place but since dead We all depos'd several things that we conceiv'd impossible to be done by any Natural Agents as the Motion of Chairs Stools and Bedstaves no Body being near them the beating of Drums in the Air over the House in clear  Nights with several other things of the like Nature These Witnesses were Neighbours and depos'd that they heard and saw these things almost every Day or Night for many Months together  The preceeding Letters are Printed at the end of the Preface to the Second Part of Mr  Glanvil  's  Saducismus Triumphatus  Printed together with the First Part  Ann    After the foregoing Declaration of Mr  Mompesson  I must freely tell all Men that shall pretend a Cheat in the Translation at  Tedworth  that till they fairly make appear to the World by whom the Cheat was play'd and how the Facts Sworn to were perform'd the Imposture must lie at their Door  If we may believe  Luther  he tells us  Chap    in his  Table Talk  That he departed from  Worms  and not far from  Eisenach  was taken Prisoner and was lodged in the Castle of  Wartburg  in  Pathmo  in a Chamber far from People where none could have access to him but only two Boys that twice a Day brought him Meat and Drink among other things they brought him Hazle Nuts which he put into a Box and sometimes us'd to eat of them In the Night times the Devil came and got the Nuts out of the Box and crack'd them against one of the Beds Posts making a very great Noise and a rumbling about his Bed but he regarded him not when afterward he began to slumber he kept such a racket and rumbling upon the Chamber Stairs as if many empty Hogsheads and Barrels had been tumbled down and tho' he knew the Stairs were strongly guarded with Iron Bars so that no Passage was either up or down yet he arose and went towards the  Stairs to see what the matter was but finding the Door fast shut he said  Art thou there So be there still  and so he committed himself to  Christ  and laid him down to rest again So far  Luther    I went my self once to see a Gentleman near  Bath  and came to his House about Eleven of the Clock in the Morning his Lady said to me she wish'd I had come sooner for about an Hour before as she was coming in at the foredoor of the House she saw the Minister of the Parish come into the Entry at the backdoor and to go into the Hall whom she presently followed but found him not there whereupon she went up to her Chamber where a Midwife was to attend her she being near her time of being brought to Bed and finding the Minister not there as she expected she was much surprised and sent to his House to enquire for him and it was found he had not stirred out of his House that Day but withal the Gentleman I was to see told me they had every Night Noises in their House as though a Man should strike Hundreds of strokes with a Mallet on an empty Hogshead which kept himself and his whole Family waking and said if I would stay a Night with him I should hear the same but my occasions would not then permit me to stay  There are a World of well attested Relations in this kind but all must be Cheat and Imposture with some Men because forsooth they will have it so  To deliver somewhat of my own Opinion concerning the Power of Magick I must own my self to have been long guided by the Caution giv'n us by  Corn Agr  ppa  to prevent being  impos'd on by Pretenders to Magick and other curious and abstruse Arts in an Epistle he sent to his Friend  Ep l    Ep    the Abbot  de Aqua Pendente  where he writes as follows Have a care you are not deceived by those who have been deceived for no reading of Books whatsoever can direct you in this they being fill'd with meer  A  nigma's  O How great things are written concerning the Power of the  Magick Art  Concerning the prodigious  Images  of  Astrologers  of the powerful Metamorphosis of the  Alchimists  and concerning that Blessed Stone with which baser Metals being touch'd they are presently turned into Siver or Gold all which things are found vain when they are practis'd according to the Letter And nevertheless those things are delivered and written by great and most grave Philsophers and holy Men whose Traditions who shall dare to Charge with Falshood Nay it would be impious to believe that they purposely writ Lyes Therefore there is another Sense in what they write than is delivered by the Letter and that covered with various Mysteries but hitherto openly explained by none of the Masters and which I know not whether any Man can attain by the sole reading of Books without a skillful and faithful Master unless he be divinely inlightned which is granted to very few Therefore many labour in vain who pursue these most Secret  Arcan  of Nature applying their Minds to the bare words as they lie for by an unhappy  Genius  being fall'n from a right understanding and intangl'd in false Imaginations by the craft of exteriour Spirits they become dangerous Servants to those over whom they might Rule and not knowing  themselves they go forth after the Footsteps of their Herds seeking without themselves what they possess within them And this is what I would now have you know that the Worker of all wonderful things is in our selves who knows how to effect and that without all Crime Offence of God or Injury of Religion whatsoever the portentous  Astrologers  the prodigious  Magici  ns  the envious Persecutors of Nature the  Alchimists  and the wicked  Necromancers  worse than Devils dare promise I say that Worker of wonderful things is in us  Nos habitat non tartara sed nec sidera coeli  Spiritus in nobis qui viget illa facit  He lives in us not in the Stars nor Hell  That Spirit does it which in us does dwell  But these things are not to be committed to Paper but to be delivered by Word of Mouth which I may do when I see you As to the Philosophy you require I let you know that to know God the Maker of all things and to pass into him by a whole Image of likeness as by a certain Essential contact or tye whereby you may be transformed and made a God this is the true and solid Philosophy as the Lord speaks of  Moses  saying  Behold I have made thee a God of Pharoah  this is the highest and most occult Philosophy of wonderful Works Its  Clavis  is the understanding for the higher things we understand the more sublime Vertues we put on and the more wonderful things we Work with more ease and efficacy but our understanding being inclosed in corruptible Flesh  unless it rises above the ways of the Flesh and comes to its proper Nature cannot be united to those Divine Powers for they do not join but with their like and is wholly impotent for perceiving those most hidden Secrets of God and Nature shall a Man see God and Live What Fruit will a Grain of Corn bring forth unless it first di  s He must die die to the World and the Flesh and to all his Senses and the whole Animal Man who would enter the recesses of Secrets not that the Body is separated from the Soul but that the Soul leaves the Body concerning which Death  Paul  says to the  Colossians You are dead and your Life is hid with Christ  and elsewhere he says more clearly of himself I know a Man whether in the Body or out of the Body I know not God knows rapt to the third Heav'n  c  I say we must die this Death which is precious in the sight of the Lord which happens to very few and haply not always for  pauci quos aequus amavit  Jupiter ardens evexit ad aethera virtus  Diis geniti hoc potuere  first those who are born not of Flesh and Blood but of God next those who by a Privilege of Nature or a Geneth  iacal Gift of the Heav'ns are Dignified for it the rest build on Merits and Art concerning which I shall certifie you by Word of Mouth So far  Agripp  who has much more to the same purpose  Dr  Flood  as well elsewhere in his Works as in his  Clavis to his Philosophy and Alchimy  towards the end of it writes conformably to  what is delivered us by  Agrippa  as follows That the true  Cabalists  and true  Alchimists  are employed about one and the same thing and so the Magi wise Men and Philosophers its what no Man of a sound Mind can be Ignorant of since there is but one  summum bonum  and one true Stone at which Mark all that are truly Wise most attentively Aim some of whom are employed about the  Cabala  others about  Alchimy  others about the  TheoPhilosophy  others about  Natural Magick    As to  Agrippa  I have heard some Learned Men say that in his Youth when he writ his Books of  Occult Philosophy  he had some esteem of  Magick  but as he grew Elder and when he writ his  Vanity of Sciences  he shew'd his contempt of it but I wonder Learned Men should talk thus for in his  Vanity of Sciences  he explodes  Magick  no more than he does all other Arts and Sciences and indeed he writes little there against it And he says elsewhere that he writ that Book sportingly only to try what Young Students could say for the Arts and Sciences they were so fond of and so valued themselves by And in his Epistle to  Erasmus    Epist l    Ep    he says He writ that Book in a Declamatory way in which all Liberty of Speech is used and allowed this being as Scholars that take a  Theme  and declaim  Pro  or  Con  at Pleasure If I look for  Agrippa  's true Sense of a matter I seek for it in the  Epistles  he writ to his Learned Friends and Correspondents and there he sufficiently expresses the esteem he had of the true Magick  As to the Death of the Animal Man mentioned by  Agrippa  as requir'd for initiating us towards the Performance of great things  Dr  Willis  as a skillful  Phisiologer    Exerc    c    in his Book  Of the Soul of Brutes  excellently sets forth the Contest which happens betwixt the Corporeal Soul and the Rational in the Purgative Life before the latter can settle the former in a due Subjection and keep it self to its due Purity He writes thus The Corporeal Soul does not so readily obey the Rational in Desirables as in Knowables for that being nigher the Body and so having a more intimate Affinity towards the Flesh its wholly bound to take care of the good and Perservation of that for the careful Performance of which Office its very much drawn by the various Allurements continually presented by the Objects of each Sense hence being employed about the care of the Body and under that pretext being apt to indulge Feasting and Pleasures she very often gives a Deaf Ear to Reason perswading the contrary moreover the Inferiour Soul being weary of the others Yoak on occasion being given clears it self of its Fetters affecting Liberty or Rule and then you may clearly observe Twins striving in the same Belly or rather a Man wholly divided by two Armies fighting against each other within him  Infestis obvia signis  Signa pares Aquilas vota minantia votis  This Intestine contest does not wholly cease till one of the Combatants being become Superior leads the other wholly Captive though in the mean time to establish the Empire of the Rational Soul and to vindicate its Right and Empire from the Usurpation of the sensitive  Soul the Precepts of Philosophers and Moral Institutions are put in ure and when these will not do Sacred Religion furnishes a far more powerful Aid whose Laws and Precepts being duly observ'd they are able to raise a Man not only above a Brute but ev'n himself that is above his Natural State in as much as they subject the Sensitive Soul to the Rational and both to God Nevertheless this Divine Policy is not ev'n so erected in Man without a great Contention for while Reason using its own strength joyn'd with Moral and Sacred Precepts endeavours to draw the Faculties of the Corporeal Soul to its side this rising on the contrary obstinately adheres to the Flesh and is hardly drawn from its Flatteries nay and which is to be lamented she too often seduces the chief Soul in us and carries it away with it to wallow in the Dirt of sensual Pleasures so that a Man becomes either like to or worse than a Brute insomuch that Reason being become Brutal leads to every excess and notwithstanding the Minds Empire is not always and wholly overthrown but sometime or other either returning to her self of her own accord or being awaken'd by some occasion given and conscious of her Lapse she rises up against the sensitive Soul as an Enemy and Traitor and throwning her from her Throne commands her Obedience Nay sometimes she compels her by reason of Crimes committed to torture her self and her beloved Flesh and so by inflicting Punishments on her self to Expiate as she may her own Faults which kind of Act and Affect of Conscience of a Man's torturing himself being proper to Man plainly  shews him either to have two subordinate Souls within him or at least that the Parts of his Soul are very differing whereof as the one opposes the other and contends for the Mastery it happens that Man is carryed away to contrary purposes and is Exagitated little less than a Daemoniack obsess'd by a Legion  The same Author in the same Book writes more of the said Contest as follows  Dissert    c d' Melanc  Superstition and Despair of Eternal Salvation are wont to imprint on the sensitive Soul the Blood and Body in a manner the like affects of Melancholy as Love and Jealousie tho' some way after a different manner of affecting for in the former the Object whose getting or loss is in danger is wholly Immateral and its design being first conceiv'd by the Rational Soul is Imprinted on the Corporeal in the prosecution of which if this readily obeys then no Perturbation of a Man's Mind arises but if the Corporeal Soul withstanding as it often happens the Rational still insists with Admonitions and Threats presently the other growing hot moves the Blood and Spirits after a disorderly manner opposes Corporeal Goods and Pleasures to the Spiritual presented by the Understanding and endeavours to draw the Man to her side and as thus there is a continual struggle betwixt the two Souls and sometimes the Will is Superior sometimes the sensitive Appetite prevails at length a Court of Conscience is erected by the Mind where all particular Acts are scrupulously examined by reason of these frequent Variances of the Souls the Animal Spirits as being too much and in a manner perpetually exercised and being commanded here and there contrary  ways and almost distracted fall somewhat at length from their Vigour and Natural Disposition and at last being rendred fixt and melancholick as they are detained from their wonted Expansion they frame out of Course and unusal traces in the Brain and so cause a  Delirium  with an excess of Fear and Sadness In those kinds of affects the Corporeal Soul being carryed away as it were by Violence both Divorces it self from the Body and being modified according to the Character of the  Idea  imprinted is wont to take a New  Species  either  Angelical  or  Diabolical  mean while the Understanding inasmuch as the Imagination suggests to it only discorderly and monstrous Notions is wholly perverted from the use of the right Reason  After the like way of affecting it happens that some melancholy Persons fall into Imaginary  Metamorphoses  either as to their Fortunes or their Bodies one imagining himself and Acting as a Prince another as a Beggar one thinks his Body to be made of Glass another thinks himself a Dog a Wolf or some other Monster for after the Corporeal Soul being affected with a lasting Melancholy and b  inded in Mind has wholly departed from her self and the Body she affects a New  Species  or Nature and as much as in her lies really assumes it So far Dr  Willis    I hope this may not seem an overlong Digression in regard it seems to me to contain a more clear Explication than may easily be found in other Authors of the contest which happens betwixt our two Souls within us in order to the Spiritual Death of the Animal Man and our assuming a Divine Nature  capable of wonderful Works▪ as mentioned by  Agrippa    But after all the reasoning of  Agrippa  in which he has excellently set forth what relates to Internal Operations of the Mind and the way of bringing it to its hightest Perfection and Purity I do not see how he Accounts for the External Operations perform'd by Magicians of which there are a World of Instances unless he will have it with the  Arabian  Philosophers that the Soul  the Power of the Imagination can perform what it pleases as penetrate the Heav'ns force the Elements demolish Mountains raise Vallies to Mountains and do with all Material Forms as it pleases  Mr  Blunden  having sent a Letter from  London  to  Paulus Felgenbalder  at  Amst  rd  m  to desire his Opinion concerning  M  gical Performances  he returned him an Answer in  Latin An  which Answer a Gentleman having favour'd me with a sight and perusal of I give you here the Substance of it  He divides Magick and Magicians into three kinds  viz  Divine Natural and Diabolical Now all Magick he says consists in the Spirit by Faith for Faith is that  M  gnet  of the Magicians by which they draw Spirits to them and by which Spirits they do great things  viz  either by the Spirit of God or by Natural Spirits or by the Spirit of  Daemons  Therefore all Magick consists in a Spirit and every Magician Acts by a Spirit Magicians that are of God Work by the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost by Magicians  Cor  Natural Magicians Work all things by the Natural Spirits of the Elements but Witches and  Daemoniacal Magicians as  Jannes  and  Jambres  in  Aegypt  Work their Magical Performances by the Spirit of  Daemons  he concludes therefore that all Operations and Works of efficacy are wrought by a Spirit Now he says it must be well observ'd that the Magicians which are of God and the Natural Magicians very much differ Natural Magicians are shewn us  Matth  and by Natural Magick  Daemons  are also cast forth but not all kinds of  Daemons  and so many Works of efficacy are wrought by Natural Magick also Natural Divinations and Prophecies  Act  such the  Pythonissa  was that raised  Samuel Sam  who appeared in a Body of Wind and Air as all the Bodies of the Dead till the Resurrection which produces a Spiritual Body consisting of a Spirit Light and the Heav'ns Spiritual Elements The Spirits of the Elements attend this Natural Magick and obey the Magician but we must know that in some Pers  the Natural Magick and Daemoniacal are  and promiscuous as the Magick which is from God and the Natural Magick and also in some part the Daemoniacal were mixt in  Balaam  who also sought  Auguries Numb  being willing to make himself gracious to God and also to Man and so to please both and therefore the Angel of God resisted him  c  and for this Hypocrisie he died by the Sword  c    Though therefore he says Natural Magicians do many Works of efficacy by Spirits yet they do not do these in the Name of God and Christ though they talk much of the Name  Adonai  and call upon it yet this Name may be taken in vain and by the Permission  of God Natural Spirits bring to pass  Auguries  So also Natural Magick and the Daemoniacal are promiscuous in some Persons but if a Person by Natural Magick should cast out  Daemons  it does not follow that this was also from Divine Magick and if  Daemons  are cast out by Natural Magick by one that is in the fear of God it does not follow that he is a true Magician of God for Natural Magick truly casts forth Spirits and  Daemons  if it be true Natural Magick but if it exorbitates to Daemoniacal then it is condemn'd and when Natural Magick keeps within its bounds it is not condemn'd by Christ read  Luke  the wherefore the Name  Adonai  and of  Christ  may be us'd both rightly and in a sinister way rightly as in the place before quoted in a Sinister way  Act c  and so the Magicians of Daemons resisted the Magicians of God  c  and  Tim    He subjoins that ev'n Natural Magick is  to be practis'd by any Christian because all Magick is wrought by a Spirit and we ought not to seek a Conversation with Spirits and for that  Satan  mixes himself with the Natural Spirits And whereas some allow the practise of Magick with the Angels of God he says That no Man ought to have to do with Angels without God's Command And with this Abstract of that Letter I conclude this Chapter of Magick  CHAP XI What may be suggested from Reason concerning the Existence of Spirits and their Operations  KIrcher  in  Epist Paraenet  prefixt to his  Obeliscus Pamphilius  writes thus We know a threefold Demonstration has been always us'd by the unanimous Consent of Philosophers in the Acquisition of Science Mathematical Physical and Moral Mathematical Demonstration as it inquires into the affects and Properties of Quantity by Principles known by the Light of Nature of Eternal Truth and void of all deceit so it begets a certain and properly called Science all scruple of doubt being remov'd Physical Demonstration as it comes by Experiments of things to the Secret knowledge of Causes it begets indeed Science but by reason of the Experiment which for the most part is exposed to the false Representations of the Senses it is not void of Deception nor does arrive at the certitude of the former yet according to  Aristotle  it Triumphs with the Title of true Science Moral Demonstration as it depends on the Experience of Humane Actions begets indeed Science but such as the Nature of Moral things admits and which is call'd Humane Faith and for the most part relies on the Authority of the Relater For the like cause  the Authority of the Revealer begets Divine Faith more certain than all Science Humane Authority is a certain imitation of this on which we must relie unless we will make void and annihilate the Histories of all pass'd things I speak not here of the Authority and Histories of suspected Credit but of those which have the clear Prescription of many Ages for their Authority So far  Kircher    Now laying this before us it is to be noted That Christian Divines do not pretend to a Mathematical or Physical Demonstration of the Existence of Spirits for their Existence cannot be demonstrated from their Essence or the effects ascrib'd to them not from the first because it's not from the Nature of Spirits nor from that of any other Creature that they Exist for God so freely created all Beings that he might have left them uncreated nor from their effects because the concourse of God alone or other Causes might be conceived to suffice for such effects but Christian Divines build chiefly on Divine Revelation which is superior to all Science and on the constant Tradition of all Christian Divines from the first Ages of Christianity and all they pretend to as Physiologers in what they say concerning Spirits is that there is nothing in it which implies a Contradiction or is inconsistent with Reason and as there have been and are many  Phaenomena  in the World which it has concern'd Philosophers to Account for the Doctrine of the Existence of Spirits has been Hypothetically introduc'd into the World and back'd by as great Men among the  Gentiles  as the World has had and tho' other Philosophers have set up other Hypothesis  for explaining those  Phaenomena  yet I think it would be a strange rashness in any Person owning the Law of  Moses  or  Christ  to throw by an Hypothesis back'd by Divine Revelation or rather introduc'd by the most Learned of the  Gentiles  Consonant to it and to adhere to any other Hypothesis excogitated meerly by the Wit of Man and which in truth does not so fairly account for  Phaenomena  as the other does or shamefully to deny Facts which are to be accounted for as I know not with what unbounded Confidence some ev'n among Christians have done whereas  Vanini  who died a Martyr to Atheism and  Pomponatius  who has been look'd upon by some to have been of the same Opinion and many others freely own'd the Facts which they found uncontestably manifested to them by Experience and Testimonies though they did not think fit to explain them by the Agency of Spirits but as free Naturalists set up other Hypothesis as they thought good for explaining them So  Alchindus  in his Works referred to Nature all things that are ascribed to  Angels  and  Devils  as since him  Petrus Aponus  and  Pomponatius  have done imagining that all Sublunary things were wholly subject to and depending on Celestials and that they received all Vertues and Properties the one from the other and each particular from the whole together by the means of certain Corporeal Rays which pass from the least even to the greatest and which they supposed the cause of all that is done in Nature As  Marcus Mar  of late referred all to  Ideas  so  Avicenna  to  In  l  igen  es Galen  to the Temperament and these▪ with many other Philosophers have exerted  all their force to take off the Admiration of many extraordinary Effects by setting forth the most likely Causes of them they could imagine but how far a Man may have Reason to acquiesce in any of those Hypothesis will still be the Question  For the Rationality of the Hypothesis of Spirits  Plutarch  introduces  Cleombrotus    L de defect Orac  thus delivering himself As those say very well who hold that  Plato  having invented this Element whence Qualities spring and are ingendred which is sometimes called the first Matter and sometimes Nature has freed the Philosophers from many Difficulties so it seems to me that those who have introduc'd the Nature of  Daemons  betwixt that of the Gods and Men have resolv'd more Doubts and Difficulties and greater having found the tye which conjoins and holds together as it were our Society and Communication with them be it that this Opinion came from the Ancient  Magi  and  Zoroaster  or from  Thracia  and  Orpheus  or from  Aegypt  or from  Phrygia  as we Conjecture considering the Sacrifices that are made in those Countries  Father  le Brun  in his Book quoted before by me  c  after having set forth many odd Discoveries of hidden things made by the  Virgula divinatoria  in his second Part  c  examines the Causes of its turning in order to Discoveries and having as I conceive validly refuted all Natural Causes which others have pretended to assign for it he concludes it is done by the Agency of evil Spirits the Existence of which he proves as follows  If there are Effects that cannot be produc'd by Bodies there must necessarily be in the World other Beings than Bodies and if among these prodigious Effects there are some that do not carry Men to God and make them fall into Error and Illusion it's a farther invincible Argument that we must acknowlegde other Beings than the Being absolutely perfect and Bodies So those extraordinary Effects which can neither be called in doubt nor be Attributed to God or to Bodies are an Incontestable proof that we must admit created Spirits capable of amusing Men and seducing them by Deceits Though therefore the Scriptures had not clearly taught us the Existence of Spirits seperated from Bodies I dare say that extraordinary Effects such as the discovery of many hidden things by the turning of the  Virgula Divinatoria  would give a strong proof that there are wicked Spirits But their Existence is clear enough in the Scriptures and certainly its the best establish'd of all the Articles of our Faith the least contested and the most universally disperss'd through the World  Part  c  Maimonides  in his  More N  vochan  proves with much Learning and Judgment that before  Moses  the  Sabeans A  gyptians  and  Chaldae  ns  knew the good and evil  Genii  all the Ancient Poets and Philosophers own'd this  Dogm  and we find in the History of the Conversion of People that it has been always sound establish'd among the most remote Nations nor can it be said as some may pretend that this is a proof of the stupidness of some Nations for the most Polite People differ not in this from those they call  Barbarians  and we may see in the Works of  Porphyrius  Jamblichus  and  Clemens Alexandrinus  how much the Doctrine of the  Greeks  was like to that of the  Aegyptians  concerning the Existence of good and evil Spirits  The new converted Christians of the Primitive Times who being disabus'd of the Follies of Paganism were watchful on the practice of the  Gentiles  to discover their Impostures own'd that sometimes  Prodigies  were wrought by the  Daemons Minutius Foelix  who liv'd in the second Century has very well set forth what the Sense of the Christians of those Times was concerning the Nature and Operations of those  Daemons  whom the  Gentiles  Worship'd  Tertullian  and  Origen  and almost all the Writers of the Three first Centuries have delivered the same with all the Assurance that Truth may give And what these great Men have said is a very good Answer to what is some  imes Objected that Christ destroyed the Kingdom of  S  tan  and that the Prince of this World is now judg'd  Joh  St  Peter  St  Paul  and St  John  Men well instructed in the Words of Christ and in the Sense that ought to be giv'n them tell us that the Devil as a roaring Lyon goes about to deceive us that we ought to have recourse to Prayer and keep us firm in Faith to preserve us from his Artifices and the snares he lays for us The Devil therefore is not out of the World so that he Acts no longer but is driven from a great many Places where he had Rule It's a Truth of our Faith that God has left some Power to Devils and he permits them on many occasions to put it in Execution The frequent Possessions in the first Ages of the Church are authentick Testimonies  of it and the best averred Histories since Christ And a thousand Superstitious Practices producing extraordinary Effects furnish us with incontestable Proofs of the Operation of  Daemons  and is there any Ecclesiastical Writer who has not either prov'd or suppos'd this Truth The Learned  Gerson  tells us what we ought to believe in this Case  Part    p    and whence it is that this Truth makes so little Impression on the Spirits of many Persons saying Certainly its an Impiety and an Error directly contrary to the Scriptures to deny that  Daemons  are Authors of many surprizing Facts and those that look upon all that is said of it as a Fable and make a Mock of Divines for ascribing Effects to  Daemons  deserve a severe Correction Sometimes even the Learned fall into this Error because they let their Faith be weaken'd and their Natural Light be darken'd Their Souls being all possess'd with sensible things refer all to Bodies and cannot raise themselves to Spirits detached from Matter It's what  Plato  has said that nothing so much hinders the finding of Truth as to refer all things to what the Senses present us with  Cicero  St  Austin Albertus Magnus Guliel Parisiensis  and above all Experience have taught us the same we may see a Proof of it in the  Sadduces  and  Epicureans  who admitting nothing but what is Corporeal find themselves among those Sensless Persons of whom  Solomon  speaks in  Ecclesiastes  and the Book of  Wisdom  who have push'd their Folly so far that they cannot own they have a Soul and effects that cannot be produc'd but by Spirits I would there were no more Persons of that Mind but we shall always find some who will tell  us in cold Blood that they cannot believe  Prodigies  nor  Miracles  because they have seen nothing of extraordinary Dispute not with such Persons when a Man will be incredulous he will be so in the midst of  Prodigies  and  Miracles  there are always found People tempered like  Celsus  and  Lucian  who will have all things to be Fable Illusion and Imposture Many Persons measure all things by what they ordinarily see and hold all for false that surpass the bounds of Nature They believe Facts while they appear Natural convince them that they cannot so be and you shall see them presently conclude them Impostors  It's manifest that we conceive but two sorts of Beings  Spirits  and  Bodies  and that since we can reason but according to our Ideas we ought to ascribe to Spirits what cannot be produc'd by Bodies So far the Abstract from Father  Le Brun    The Author of the  Republick of Learning  in the Month of  August An  has given us a rough Draught for writing a good Tract of  Witchcraft  which he looks upon as a  Desideratum  where among other things he writes thus Since this Age is the true time of  Systems  one should be contrived concerning the Commerce that may be betwixt  Daemons  and Men  On this Passage Father  Le Brun  writes thus Doubtless here the Author complies with the Language of a great many Persons who  Ib part    c    for want of Attention and Light would have us put all Religion in  Systems  Whatever regard I ought to have for many of these Persons I must not be afraid to say that there is no  System  to be made of those Truths which we ought to learn distinctly by Faith because we  must advance nothing here but what we receive from the  Oracle  We must make  Systems  to explain the effects of the  Loadstone  the ebbing and flowing of the  Sea  the motion of the  Planets  for that the Cause of these Effects is not evidently signified to us and many may be conceiv'd by us and to determine us we have need of a great number of Observations which by an exact Induction may lead us to a Cause that may satisfie all the  Phaenomen  It's not the same in the Truths of Religion we come not at them by groaping and it were to be wish'd Men spake not of them but after a decisive and infallible Authority It's thus we should speak of the Power of  Daemons  and of the Commerce they have with Men It's of Faith that they have Power and that they attack Men and try to seduce them divers ways We find it in  Job  in  Tobit  and in a thousand other places of Scripture and Tradition It's certain also that the Power they have depends not of us that they have it over the Just since they may tempt them as they did  Christ  Tho' they have it not ordinarily but over those that want Faith or fear not to partake of their Works and that to these last particularly the disorder'd  Intelligences  try to make exactly succeed what they wish Inspiring them to have recourse to certain Practises  Dialog    by which those seducing Spirits enter in Commerce with Men All this is discover'd without  System  So far  Le Brun    Gregory  setting forth the Orthodox Opinion concerning Spirits says That all things in this visible World are govern'd by an invisible Being but  Aristotle  tho' he assign'd spiritual Substances  to the Celestial Bodies whose number he conceiv'd according to the number of the Spheres mov'd yet he tells us of none that preside over Inferior Bodies unless haply Human Souls And this because he thought of no Operations in reference to inferior things but natural for which the Motion of the Celestial Bodies suffic'd  But the Assertors of Christian Truth who affirm many things to be done here which exceed the Power of Nature have thought it necessary that  Angels  should preside immediately over us  Avicenna  was of Opinion that only one Immaterial Substance presided over all Inferior Bodies which he call'd the  Intellectus Agens  But the Holy Doctors not disagreeing with the  Platonicks  have taught that distinct Spiritual Substances presided over differing Corporeal Things So far  Greg    Having set forth the Opinion of Christians concerning Spirits establish'd as well by Reason as by Authority both Divine and Humane I shall now consider the Opinions of the  Perapateticks Epicureans  and  Sadduces  denying the existence of Spirits and shall here set down the notorious Principles they generally go upon leaving those that please to follow them and to partake of the Consequents of them  First Aristotle  held That God is not the Creator of the World but that it was from Eternity and will so continue  Phys    Met  where  Aquinas lect  says That he held this Opinion firmly and not problematically tho' in his  Topicks  he says it was a Problem among the ancient Philosophers  That God does not take care of Inferior Things nay That he would become Vile if he minded them  Met    Text    That God is a necessary and no free Agent as being the Soul of the first Sphere which he cannot but move and that he cannot move a Stone with us  Phys    Met    That Heaven and Hell are the Fables of Legislators  Met    in    That the particular Souls of Men die with the Body and That there is only one Immortal Soul which is not the Form of the Body but assisting to all Bodies  That there are no  Daemons  nor  Angels  but the Movers of the Spheres who are in Bliss by that motion and cannot but move them  Met    l de Mundo    That God does not send  Dreams  because he would send them to the Wise and not to Idiots as it commonly happens  L de Insomn  That Prophets are not Inspir'd by a Divine  Afflatus  but grow Mad through Melancholy and Prophecy in their Madness  In Problem Sect    These  Dogma  's with others of his were censur'd by the Councils and Fathers and if admitted all Religion and Government must fall And  Aristotle  for holding them was forc'd to fly from  Athens  otherwise he had been question'd by the Court of the  Areopagites    Secondly  The  Epicurean Philosophy  contains these  Errata  in  Physicks    It takes away the two chief Causes of Nature  viz  the eternal efficient and final Cause  It feigns all things to arise from a casual concourse of Atoms  It feigns the Sun and Stars to be Vapours kindled and burning  It affirms the Souls of Men to die with the Body  Thirdly  The  Sadduces  Deny the  Resurrection    They reject all Tradition of the Fathers and some of them all the Prophets but  Moses    They believe the Souls of Men to be Mortal and to die with the Body The  Arabian  Heresy which was trump'd up about Years after  Chrict  as it's observ'd by the Learned  Wigandus  in his  Tract de Homine  having some Alliance with this Opinion of the  Sadduces  it asserting the Souls of Men to die with the Body tho' it allows it to be restor'd with the Body at the Resurrection Which  Dogma  has been new vampt of late by some of our Authors Whereas  Christ  plainly says  Matth    They cannot kill the Soul  They deny God's Providence and ascribe all things to Man's FreeWill  They deny Angels and Spirits  Now the  Sadduces  being a Sect among the  Jews  and owning at least the Books of  Moses  and finding mention there made of  Angels  and  Spirits  they say that by the word  Spirit  in the Scriptures we are not to understand any substantial Being but either certain Qualities Motions or Inspirations in Men or else certain Divine Phantasms or Appearances created by God to serve some present occasions which cease to be as soon as they disappear  And indeed as Mr  Lawrence  observes in his  Discourse of Angels c    sect  the word  Spirit  is sometimes us'd in these Senses in the Scriptures because Spirits being very active Natures working tho' powerfully yet insensibly therefore such Impressions Qualities and Affections in Men as powerfully and secretly move them are call'd Spirits Again Because  Spirits  are such pure Substances as cannot be perceiv'd by our Senses therefore meer Phantasms and Appearances are sometimes call'd  Spirits  But when it's said  John  that  God is a Spirit  c Is God only a Quality or meer Phantasm Is He not a proper Spirit or a spiritual Substance  The  Sadduces  Notion of  Spirits  seems to resemble that which  Monsieur Charas  has of the Venom of  Vipers  He thinks no Man can assign any part in a  Viper  where there is real Venom and says the Venom has nothing material in it that it's a pure effect of the Imagination of the  Viper  which forms to it self an Idea of Vengeance which he produces but in the Instant of his Anger and that its annihilated as soon as he ceases to be irritated For confirming which he gives us this Experiment that upon swallowing the Blood of a  Viper  or pouring it on a Wound no ill accident follows which a Man would think it would if Venom were really included in it  Having laid down the general Principles of these Philosophers I shall now particularly consider their Ground for rejecting Spirits and their Operations  These Philosophers especially the two later who have many adherents even to this Day  chiefly reject Spirits because they say they can have no Notion of such a thing as a Spiritual Substance Now as to this I think our late Mr  Lock  in his Elaborate  Essay on Humane Understanding  has fairly made out  L    c    that Men have as clear a Notion of a Spiritual Substance as they have of any Corporeal Substance Matter or Body and that there is as much Reason for admitting the Existence of the one as of the other so that if they admit the latter it is but Humour in them to deny the former He reasons thus If a Man will examine himself concerning his Notion of pure Substance in general he will find he has no other Idea of it but only a supposition of he knows not what support of such Qualities which are capable of producing simple Ideas in us which Qualities are commonly called Accidents thus if we talk or think of any particular sort of Corporeal Substance as Horse Stone  c  though the Idea we have of either of them be but the Complication or Collection of those several simple Ideas or sensible Qualities which we use to find united in the thing call'd Horse or Stone yet because we cannot conceive how they should subsist alone nor one in another we suppose them to Exist in and supported by some common subject which support we denote by the name of Substance though it be certain we have no clear or distinct Idea of that thing we suppose a support  The same happens concerning the Operations of our Mind  viz  thinking reasoning fearing  c  which we concluding not to subsist of themselves and not apprehending how they can belong to Body we are apt to  think these the Actions of some Substance which we call Spirit Whereby its evident that having no other Notion of Matter but something wherein those many sensible Qualities which affect our Senses do subsist by supposing a Substance wherein thinking knowing doubting and a Power of moving  c  do subsist we have as clear a Notion of the Nature or Substance of Spirit as we have of Body the one being suppos'd to b  without knowing what is the  Substratum  to those simple Ideas which we have from without and the other suppos'd with a like ignorance of what it is to be the  Substratum  of those Operations which we Experiment in our selves within 'tis plain then that the Idea of Corporeal Substance in Matter is as remote from our Conceptions and Apprehensions as that of Spiritual Substance and therefore from our not having any Notion of the Substance of Spirit we can no more conclude its  Nonexistence  than we can for the same reason deny the Existence of Body it being as Rational to affirm there is no Body because we cannot know its Essence as its called or have the Idea of the Substance of Matter as to say there is no Spirit because we know not its Essence or have no Idea of a Spiritual Substance  Mr  Lock  also comparing our Idea of Spirit with our Idea of Body thinks there may seem rather less Obscurity in the former than in the latter Our Idea of Body he takes to be an extended solid Substance capable of communicating Motion by Impulse and our Idea of Soul is a Substance that thinks and has a Power of exciting Motion in Body by Will or Thought Now some perhaps will say  they cannot comprehend a thinking thing which perhaps is true but he says if they consider it well they can no more comprehend an extended thing and if they say they know not what 'tis thinks in them they mean they know not what the Substance is of that thinking thing no more says he do they know what the Substance is of that solid thing and if they say they know not how they think he says neither do they know how  hey are extended how the solid Parts of Body are United or Cohere to make Extension  c  The Learned Monsieur  Le Clerc  who generally considers how far Humane Reason can bear in judging of Points laid before it argues consonantly to what is before deliver'd by Mr  Lock  in his  Coronis  added at the end of the Fourth Volume of his Philosophical Works in the Third Edition of them Where he writes as follows  When we contemplate the Corporeal Nature we can see nothing in it but Extension Divisibility Solidity Mobility and various Determinations of Quantity or Figures which being so it were a rash thing and contrary to the Laws of right reasoning to affirm other things of Bodies and consequently from meer Body nothing can be deduc'd by us which is not joyn'd in a necessary connection with the said Properties Therefore those who have thought the Properties of perceiving by Sense of Understanding Willing Imagining Remembring and others the like which have no Affimity with Corporeal things to have risen from the Body have greatly transgress'd in the Method of right Reasoning and Philosophizing which has been done by  Epicurus  and those who have thought as he did having affirm'd our Minds to be compos'd of Corporeal  Atoms  but whence shall we say they have had their rise Truly they do not owe their rise to Matter which is wholly destitute of Sense and Thought nor are they spontaneously sprung up of nothing it being an  Ontological Maxim  of most evident Truth that  nothing springs from nothing    Therefore the most Ancient  Physiologers  as the very Learned Dr  Cudworth  has shewn in his  Intellectual System of the World    Chap    when they saw nothing in Matter beside what we have said and had consider'd the  Maxim  alledged they pass'd from the Consideration of Bodies to the Contemplation of a much more excellent Nature by which they gathered Humane Minds were created and all other Intelligent Natures therefore the Consideration of the Corporeal Nature joyned with the knowledge of the Properties of our Mind lead Men the strait way to two  Tenents  of the greatest Moment  viz  the Existence of a Supream Deity and the Creation of Man's Soul by God whence also is deduced its Immortality to which we may add that though the Authority of Divine Revelation be worthy of Credit by it self yet it is not a little confirm'd in our Minds when we see the Lights of Revelation and right Reason friendly conspire betwixt themselves for they are two Sisters fall'n from Heav'n together wherefore their Agreement must necessarily be very great as being Sprung from one Father but we do not apprehend their Agreement at first sight nor can understand it without an intent Meditation If right Reason deny'd what right Revelation  affirms and we thought they disagreed we should stand doubtful betwixt them nor should we well satisfie our selves which we ought to believe but they agreeing who can withhold his Faith from them but he that would be accounted not only to have little Religion but likewise wholly destitute of Reason Wherefore there is no cause for those that give not Credit to Revelation to flatter themselves as though they were Wiser than the vulgar when at the same time they naturally exclude themselves from the Number of Men that use Reason  See there also what he further smartly argues for the Immortality of the Soul  The same Monsieur  le Clerc  in his  Pneuma  ologia  has delivered several things concerning Spirits and their Operations of which I have extracted the few following Heads as thinking them of use for directing our Judgments in Considerations of that Nature  Those who affirm or deny that Spirits can be without any Corporeal property go farther than they ought for we cannot gather from the Nature of Spirits which is unknown to us whether they are without all Corporeal property or have a subtle Body  Sect    c    As for Apparitions of Spirits he says we cannot by any Reason shew from the Nature of the thing it self that it is not possible for Spirits to be joyn'd with a subtle Body nor is it likely that so many Nations and so remote in Places and Opinions agreed in a Lye as to all they have said concerning Apparitions of Spirits Its much more likely that the ground of the Lyes invented about this Matter was some true Apparition to  which as it's usual a World of other Relations of the like kind have been feign'd  Ibid  We are so far from determining what is the Nature of an Angels Intellection that we do not comprehend ev'n the Nature of our own Intellection  Sect    c    In what the  Gentiles  say of  Daemons  and the  Hebrews  of  Angels  there is nothing contrary to any certain Knowledge we have therefore it may be they say true if the thing be consider'd in it self  Sect    c    As it cannot be doubted but there are many Lyes in wha  is related concerning strange Performances by Witches upon a contract with  Daemons  so it would be rashness to Charge them all of Falshood especially since the Scriptures relate some things like them and truly the thing it self is not so known to us that we may gather from the Nature of  Daemons  which may not consist at least with many things that are related of them if any Man because both good and evil  Angels  are believed to be thinking Substances should contend that they have no Power on Bodies because naked thought has no Power on Bodies before this were granted him he ought to shew and that evidently  First  That there is nothing in Angels beside Thought  Secondly  That there is no tye instituted by God betwixt their Wills and some Changes of Bodies for if either of these may be admitted without absurdity they may also be thought able to Act on Bodies without absurdity  Sect    c    Some say no true Miracles but Cheats are perform'd by  Daemons  but to Understand what this means we must define the Words that are here us'd a Portent a Miracle or  a Prodigy are here the same things and they denote an Effect  First  Above Humane Power  Secondly  Beside the constant Course of Nature  Thirdly  That it's done at Mans Pleasure or at the Moment he will Now who can make out by certain Arguments that nothing can be done by evil  Daemons  above Humane Power beside the usual Course of Nature at the Moment the Magician pleases since the bounds of Angelical Power are unknown we can here assert nothing but from Experience  Ibid  Those that deny some wonderful Facts for the most part contend they are  Praestigia  but beside that they affirm what they know not this word may be taken in a twofold Sense  Praestigia  by some are so understood as tho'  Daemons  present to the Senses a thing that is not as if it were as that an House for Instance may seem to be there where there is none but to do this either they move the Brain of Spectators as its wont to be moved when an House is before them or they present a certain sort of an Appearance of an House in the Air which strikes the Eyes of Spectators but choose either of these it must be shewn how this is no Miracle for both are done above Humane Power and beside the Order of Nature and at the time the Magician pleases  Ibid  Those Opinions or Diseases of the Brain which Witches have who think they go to Feasts and Dancings upon their talking of it to others that are of a timorous Disposition and weak Brains bring others into the same Fits of Fury and like a contagion spread far and near infecting many Heads Though  it's observable that those Diseases are more frequent among Inhabitants of Mountains and Solitary places than among those that live in Cities or among a Concourse of People Whence also it appears that the Terror of vast Solitudes which is apt to move the Brain contributes much to this Madness we must add to this that Persons abounding with Melancholy are more capable of this Madness and on the contrary those are freest from it who are of a merry Disposition which raises my Suspicion that all these Visions are nought but the Sports of a timerous and melancholy Brain  If it shall seem strange that so many Men should be impos'd on by their fear and temper of Body all Admiration may be taken away by Instances of a greater fury many Diseases so trouble the Brain that those that labour under them seem to themselves to see things that are no where that kind of Disease if it be join'd with a vehement Motion of the Blood and lasts long it at length consumes the Diseas'd and if the Motion of the Blood abates the Disease is lessen'd and the Diseas'd returns to a sound Mind but if the Disease does not so vehemently affect the Blood but that it may continue a long time without destroying the Diseas'd or a lessening of his strength strange things are presented to his Mind for many Years as it's manifest in many Instances Nor are there only those who think they see without themselves things that are no where but also such as obstinately assert themselves to be Wolves or I know not what Wild Beasts Whoever weighs these things will not wonder if Opinions of Witches are accounted melancholy Diseases  Yet tho' these things may be so I will not affirm that those things which Witches relate have never happen'd but for one thing that has truly happen'd I believe there have been a thousand Dreams of a deluded Mind So far Monsieur  le Clerc Sect    c    But to return a little to the  Epicureans  and  Sadduces  perhaps they may desire of me a clear Definition of a Spirit or such an one as they would like Now I think Monsieur  le Clerc  has well answered this in his Preface to his  Pneumatologia  writing thus We call all things endow'd with an Understanding and a Will Spirits but as we consider them as Spiritual Substances he says  Part    c    he has shewn in his Logick that the inward Nature of any Substances whatsoever as well as that of Spirits is unknown to us wherefore Men ought not to expect from us an absolutely compleat Description of Spirits  But since these Gentlemen are for having all things made out very plainly to them let us examine their Physical Principles  Democritus  and  Epicurus  would have all Natural Effects whatsoever to proceed from a Conflux of Attoms variously Figur'd so that in every Body there are Particles that are round acuminated square cylindrical striated and of other Configurations and that according to the various locking together of them a subject is of this or another Figure Operation or Efficacy  Now as our Learned Dr  Willis  has observed this  Epicurean  Opinion  L de Ferm c    rather supposes than demonstrates their Principles and teaches of what sort of Figure those Elements of Bodies are not what they are and also  induces Motions very subtle and remote from our Senses and which do not satisfie the  Phaenomena  of Nature when we descend to Particulars and thinks it concerns them to shew that those Conceptions of theirs are Real he being too short sighted to discern them so  Again As for  Aristotle  's reasoning against the Existence of Spirits in his Book  De Mundo  if it be his  viz  that since God can do all things of himself he does not stand in need of Ministring  Angels  and  Daemons  a multitude of Servants shewing the weakness of a Prince But if this Argument would hold good  Aristotle  should not suppose Intelligences moving the Celestial Spheres for God suffices to move all without ministring Spirits nor would there be need of a Sun in the World for God can enlighten all things by himself and so all Second Causes were to be taken away Therefore there are Angels in the World for the Majesty of God not for that he wants them and for Order not for his Omnipotency and who told  Aristotle  there were Intelligences that moved the Celestial Spheres Is not this Hypothesis as precarious as any Man may pretend that of Spirits to be And I believe there are few Philosophers at present who agree with  Aristotle  in that Opinion And indeed I think  Kircher  in the right where he tells us it's certain  Aristotle  took his Intelligences from the  Hebrews  who beholding the Multiform face of the World  Obel Pamph Pag    and the discording concord of things believed it to be govern'd by certain presiding Angels and hence also the Fiction of the Nine Muses took its rise  Moreover when  Aristotle  lays down his Principles of Natural Things he tells us they are Matter Form and Privation unintelligible Terms and when he comes to define his Matter he tells us it is what is neither  quid  nor  quantum  nor  quale  nor  aliquid eorum quibus ens determinatur  a notable clear Notion of Matter  obscurum per obscurius  and I think no Man will pretend the notion we have of Spirits to be more obscure than this  In short those that will take upon them to rectify our notions of things ought to bring us notions of things more clear than what we have especially where Religion is concern'd as in this case it is and Young Wits who are well opinioned of their Parts may do well to try here what they can suggest to us beyond what is here argued and I am apt to think whatever conceit they may have of themselves they will not be found so overdoing in Argument but they  will still find a valid reply  ready for them  CHAP XII Considerations on Dr  Bekker's  Books against Spirits with a Conclusion to this Book  FRommannus  in his Tract of  Fascination    L    part    c    tells us that  Voetius  above all others has made out by firm Reasons that there is such a thing as Diabolical and Magical  Fascination  and this he undertook as he says because upon reading  Mr  Scot  's Book in which he has openly deny'd and professedly oppugn'd the Crime of Magick and ascribes all its wonderful effects either to Melancholy or other natural Diseases or to the Art Industry and Agility of Men imposing on us by their  Praestigia  or to the foolish Imaginations of the said Magicians or to their vain Fables and Fictions after it was Translated into  Law Dutch  not a few from that time both Learned and Unlearned began to Scepticize and turn Libertines concerning  Magick    From this Source I conceive among other Works the Four Volumes of the late Dr  Bekker  Entituled  Le monde en  hantè  that is  the World Bewitched  of which the First Volume is Translated into  English  have flown he generally therein agreeing with Mr  Scot  and rejecting all Magical Incantations  Indeed the great Principle Dr  Bekker  goes upon is That there were Devils once in the World who corrupted Humane Nature but since that time God Almighty put them in Chains so that they have never made any Figure in the World since by acting any way against Mankind or otherwise  As I perused Dr  Bekker  's said Volumes in  French  I found some Persons had writ against him and thereupon I sent to  Holland  for all that was Writ against him and any Reply's he had made but could get only one small Volume writ by  Monsieur Binet  in  French  Entit'led  A general Idea of the Pagan Divinity Serving for a refutation of Monsieur  Bekkers  System concerning the Existence and Operations of Daemons  Printed at  Amsterdam An  This Book is composed of Six Letters writ by  Mr  Binet  to a Friend and I shall here give you an Abstract of what I find most material in them in reference to Dr  Bekker  's System In his first Letter he tells us He finds in Mr  Bekker  's Works much Zeal and Confidence in advancing Novelties but no proofs to Maintain them and unless you suffer your self to be surprized with a certain Air of Triumph wherewith he animates his Expressions you will run a risque of remaining still Inchanted especially if you deny certain Principles which he has laid down without proof all the Work will fall of it self  He observes that where Mr  Bekker  speaks of Spirits all things seem to him perplext with difficulties you shall scarce find a passage in the Scripture that speaks of them all is Mysterious Allegorical The proper Names of Angels Devils Daemons  c  are but Men sent Calumniators Evil Thoughts or at most mere Symbols to give us some Metaphorical  Idea  of the Majesty of God  He next cites the Passage following from Mr  Bekker  's Preface to his first Vollume  It's now look'd on as a piece of Piety for a Man truly to Fear God and also the Devil if we do not this a Man passes for an Atheist that is for a Man who believes no God because he cannot believe there are two one Good and another Evil but I believe says he we may with reason call those Men  Ditheists  or such as believe two Gods On this Passage Mr  Binet  writes as follows  This Passage extreamly reflecting on our Belief I have rendered it word for word from the Text because the Translator has corrupted it by his usual softnings This  Accusation which Mr  Bekker  charges us with of making the Devil a God Almighty strikes an Horror mean while it's the foundation on which he builds his whole Work it's the Idol he will pull down it's in which the force of his Proofs consists and you shall scarce read a Chapter in him but you will find this Imputation But whoever believ'd amongst us that the Devil properly speaking is the absolute Author of all the Works they say we ascribe to him What Divine has ever consider'd him as a First and Independent Cause If we ascribe much Power to the Devil it's manifest we speak with the Scriptures and if there be any thing which does not agree with the Author's Conceptions we use but the Expressions which the  Holy Ghost  has Consecrated and thus all Mr  Bekker  's Objections Address themselves to God himself who has prescribed us a way of expressing our selves in this respect  Again he writes beneath You pretend to be well grounded in maintaining that we unjustly ascribe to the Devil the Works that are ascribed to him because he is but an Instrument who borrows from God all his Actions and I think we have as much reason to say that we deceive our selves in ascribing to Man all his operations since of himself he can do nothing therefore it will no longer be Man that Moves himself Speaks Eats Drinks but God himself for the Devil and Man are in this case in reference to God one and the same thing in an equal Impotence and an entire Dependency  You may object that this comparison of the Devil with Man is not Just the business is to  know if the one be the Author of those high and sublime Operations that are ascribed to him whereas we consider in the other but actions proper and natural to him but this difference tho' real betwixt the two Creatures is but a meer Illusion in reference to God in which properly consists the state of the Question We consider the Devil always as an Instrument in the hand of God as a Rod of Fury which strikes but when God lets it fall on those he will Visit To explain this farther I ask what vertue had  Moses  or  Aaron  and his Rod to do so many Miracles to Inflict so many Plagues on  Pharoah  and his People the simple Rod in the hand of a Man could not produce so many Miracles of it self but one was the Minister the other the Visible Sign which God accompanied with a Divine Efficacy And what would you say of a Man that would impute it to us to believe that  Moses Aaron  and his Rod were the sole cause of all these Miracles if he inlarged himself in writing great Volumes and making large Reflections for giving colour to this Absurdity and in the mean time the Scripture says  Ex  That  Aaron  having stretcht forth his Hand with his Rod on the Rivers Brooks and Ponds caused Frogs to Issue from them to cover the Land of  Aegypt  Therefore when we conceive the Devil as a Rod of Fury without any Vertue of his own it is but by relation to God the first cause who precedes determines accompanies bends the Creature how excellent soever it may be But it's manifest if you compare the Devil with Man you will find more excellency in his Nature light in his Knowledge penetration in his Sight  facility and power in his Operations his natural Knowledge is more extended not only because he beholds things with a more simple view but also by reason of the experience of all Ages which discovers to him the connections which makes him penetrate the bottom of Nature whose Springs Causes and Effects he knows after a more perfect manner than the greatest Philosopher and it's this great Knowledge the Devil has of Nature which teaches him how to move the various parts whence it is that we who know not these Springs and the manner to make them act are strangely struck at the sight of his operations and that we look on as a Miracle what is often but the operation of a  Daemon  produced by Causes otherwise apply'd and moved than according to the ordinary course of Nature and thus as the Devil has much more Light Penetration and Activity than Man we must not doubt but his Power is much superiour to his You see therefore that the Author's odious Imputations vanish of themselves and that our Doctrine is neither repugnant to Reason nor Revelation nor to the Idea of the Divine Perfections  And I cannot comprehend how these Persons will find opposition betwixt the Almighty Power of God and the Ministry of the Devil for by this Objection the Author so often makes he wholly overthrows his own Hypothesis He will have it that the clear and distinct Idea of the Divine Perfections exclude the operations of  Daemons  that there is a contradiction in believing that those Spirits oppose themselves to the Will of God Now this  Devil  this  Satan  these  Daemons  according to  you are some Calumniating Men some Adversary Humane Passions Irregular Motions of the Spirits what you please but you cannot deny at least but these Men thus Characterized are as many Enemies of God and of his Gospel Seducers Persecutors give me leave to ask you then whether it be not a thing much more Inconsistent with the Idea of God's Perfections to oppose to himself weak Creatures these Mortal Men rather than the Devil who is a Spirit disengaged from Matter of a consummate experience  And beneath It's in vain Mr  Bekker  imputes to us the fear of the Devil no he is an Enemy overcome the Seed of the Woman has bruised his head if he has any Power remaining he derives it from God alone he is in his Hand as a Rod of Fury to Chastise Men and I fear him but as the Chastisements that God displays by his Ministry are to be fear'd You see then that the Author Condemns himself while having established for Principle that according to us this abominable and Curs'd Creature does things more Miraculous than God himself has ever done He adds That supposing what is usually ascrib'd every where to the Devil and his Angels there cannot be convincing Proofs that  Jesus  is the  Christ  or that there is but one God And I confess says he that if I do not possess the Reader with a clear Conception of this in what I have Writ it's in vain that I have Composed it Now supposing that the Devil acts but Ministerially and dependently of God supposing that we attribute nothing to the Devil properly speaking of Miraculous that can be put in opposition to or parallel with the  Works of God our Proof that  Jesus  is the  Christ  and that there is but one God are exclusive to all other in regard that it being very far from there being any prerogative in this Curs'd Spirit that can be confounded with those which God possesses in the highest degree of Eminency he has deprived himself by his revolt of his most pure advantages and has precipitated himself into  Abyss of Miseries where the Idea of  severe God makes him tremble  In his Fifth Letter he writes thus  Because a truth has been corrupted by divers Fictions must it presently be rejected there is no Principle no natural Notion that can undergoe this examen without being condemned there is none but has been ill conceived and abused then there will be none that can lawfully be admitted Let us conclude therefore in general that tho' Men have err'd infinite ways concerning the Doctrine of  Daemons  that they have been conceived as Substances either Material or Spiritual or mixt tho' some have placed them in the Stars others on the Earth others in Hell tho' there have been as many Sentiments as Heads concerning their Offices tho' they have been call'd  Sylphes Gnomes Salamanders  all this will but prove at most that Men have ill conceived the nature and operations of  Daemons  but no way that we must entirely reject the ground of this Doctrine by reason of the Fables Superstition has mixt with it  And beneath W  re it true as it's gathered from the exposi  ions of Mr  Bekker  always opposite to himself that there were in the  Old Testament  no Term which signified properly  or that could according to the  Genius  of the  Hebrew Language  and the use then signifie those Spirits which we call  Satan Devils  c the  Jews  would have  aken these Terms in their proper signification so that by this name  Satanin  they had not understood  Satans  Angels of Destruction or of Death but only Adversaries Men Enemies to God and his Truth  Sadduces  for example had had  St  Paul  of Ignorance for following the sentiments of the  Pharisees  who took the affirmative since the  Pharisees  would have ill understood all the Terms of the  Old Testament  which had signified Originally and according to the then use not Angels and  Satans  but only Men either Good or Evil If then the  Jews  were Imbibed in Substance with the common Doctrine of Devils it's because they took these Expressions either for these pure and favourable Intelligences or for these impure and adversary Spirits and if they understood them in this Sense being the same which the  Holy Ghost  has us'd in the Books of the  Old Testament  they will have the same Signification and if they have the same Signification they will consequently be these same Spirits which operate here below for there is not one Passage where these Terms are found but formally teaches us their Operations so that it's an uncontestable Principle which Mr  Bekker  did not foresee that if the  Old Testament  teaches us the Existence of Devils we ought necessarily to infer their Operations because they there appear every where operating  Again If those Terms of the Old Testament which some pretend we abuse to establish the Operations of  Daemons  signifie properly but Men  dv  saries and if the Holy Tongue had never employ'd them to express these wicked Spirits it's not to be doubted but the  Jews  would have thrown it in our Dish you should have seen them exagerate the easiness of the Christians to admit  of the Operations of  Daemons  as  Pagan  and reproach them their gross Ignorance in Understanding the  Hebrew Tongue  If they forbear it and concur with us in defending the Opinion of the Operations of  Daemons  tho' they have added to them some Fables it's because that beside they know the true Signification of these Terms and that we do not make use of them to contend against them there would be too much absurdity to contest the Sense of them  We find according to Mr  Bekker  that what we believe of  Daemons  is in substance but what the  Babylonians  taught the  Jews  It's what this Gradation from the  Babylonians  to the  Jews  from the  Jews  to the first  Christians  from the first  Christians  to the  Papists  from the  Papists  to the  Protestants  evidently makes out but I wonder God has suffer'd his Church alway to be infected with this Error and that neither the Prophets that were at  Babylon  nor those that Instructed the  Israelites  after their reestablishment who thundred with so much vehemency against Errors did not oppose themselves to a Superstition so gross and Impious  Christ  came into the World to Destroy the Works of the Devil his Prophetick Office  oblig'd him to instruct the Ignorant and oppose Superstition you see him every where reprehending Vices and thundering against Errors without any bearing o  them But as for the Operations of Angels and Devils we find not the least Censure nor the least Correction would he have suffer'd these wanderings of Mans Mind without recalling it to its  Errors says Mr  Bekker  have  Foundation of the Christian Religion and would  Jesus Christ  have left them in their full vigour in using the same Terms the  Jews  had corrupted the  Pagans  had abus'd and giving then the same Ideas  If the Jews had corrupted the Terms of Angels and  Daemons  in giving them a false Signification would  Jesus Christ  instead of dissipating these Prejudices of the  Jews  have confirm'd them in their Error in expressing himself in the same Terms without having restor'd them to their true Sense and in fomenting Superstition by fabulous Examples of Men obsess'd and deliver'd from  Daemons  Would the  Apostles  have Authoriz'd Error in ascribing every where Operations to Devils which neither the  Jews  nor  Pagans  could have took in another Sense than that which was then in use compare this Objection with the th Chapter of the Author's Second Book for I pretend that the way Mr  Bekker  there Answers renders my Objection wholly unanswerable  In his Sixth Letter he writes thus Mr  Bekker  owns that all the  Pagans  Ancient and Modern  Europeans Asians Africans Americans  both North and South agree in these three chief Points which are of an incontestable  Truth That there is only one first Being or one supream Deity That there are Spirits that have had a Beginning and that are distinct from Humane Souls That those Spirits are either Good or Evil and that some of them are Friends to Men and others Enemies  See here then all the World imbib'd with an Opinion of  Daemons  whence  that what they know how erron  us  it may be must be known to them by the way of Operation and to set this Truth in a clear Light observe It's impossible that one self same Belief universally disperst and constantly receiv'd can be entirely false in the Bottom I say in the Bottom not to confound with the Substance of this Doctrine the erroneous Ideas under which it has been conceiv'd and which have been divers according to the diversity of the Imaginion  And beneath We cannot find by any certain History that the  Americans  had any Communication with the rest of the World till of late Years yet this Imagination of  Daemons  has been preserv'd among them for a great number of Ages notwithstanding their Ignorance Brutishness and Extravagances  You may say you cannot maintain that the knowledge of  Daemons  carries the Characters proper to natural Truths God has not imprinted them in the Imagination and Reason how clear soever it may be cannot raise it self so far without the aid of Revelation but I say if  Daemons  have been universally and constantly receiv'd by all the People of the World this Knowledge must flow from some solid Cause It comes neither from  the Scripture nor from Reason nor from the Imagination it's deriv'd therefore only from the Operations of  Daemons    Again As for the surprizing Operations of  Daemons  on the Idolaters Mr  Bekker  says Those who know not God as Christians know not also the Devil but a Clown would have reason to Laugh at Mr  Bekker  if he would pe  wade him that because he knows not the Nature of the Soul and of the Body and the Laws of Motion he should not pretend to feel a sound Box on the Ear given him and it's ridiculous to deny the Operations of  Daemons  on People because they are not so good Divines as to raise themselves to the Knowledge of God and the Mysteries which his Word has revealed to us or because they are Ignorant of the true Doctrine of  Daemons  So far Mr  Binet    This Author having made the foregoing Reflections on Dr  Bekker  's Four Volumes I shall have the less to say to them However as I think it proper for me to add some Considerations of my own I shall first set down as briefly as I may what I find most Material in Dr  Bekker  's Volumes deserving an Answer and then offer what I have to reply  In his First Volume he sets forth the various Opinions of People in the World concerning evil Spirits and their Operations and having there giv'n an account of many Christian Authors as well as others who have countenanc'd their Operations in several respects in his d Chapter he writes thus But I find no Author who in time pass'd has ascrib'd so little Understanding and Vertue to the Devil as for what relates to all those  Knowledges and Effects set forth by me as  Reginald Scot  We have at present  Antony Van Dale  who ascribes no more to him in his Book of  Oracles  These two Authors hold that there is no other efficient Cause of all those things that are practis'd or wrought but the Impostures of Men the Devil having nothing to do in them I hear also every Day while I am employ'd in this Work that the Men of the best Sense among us ascribe but very little Power and Knowledge to the Devil and that there are many more than I thought who as to Persons possess'd and bewitch'd are of the same Opinion with Monsieur  Daillon  who in what he has writ in  French  concerning  Daemons  maintains that all that is contained in the Scriptures concerning evil and impure Spirits ought not to be understood otherwise than of certain Diseases to which the  Jews  were wont to give such Names he believing nevertheless that it might be that evil Spirits came at the same time to concern themselves in it And beneath he adds My scope here is to relate what is said of the Devil and his Power and to examine whether it be true or not and I hold the Negative because it's much contrary to me to maintain an Opinion which ascribes so much Power and Vertue to Spirits especially evil Spirits wherefore I must rank my self with  Scot Van Dale  and many others who are opposite to the belief Men have of this Power  In his th Chapter § he tells us We have all the Reason of the World to hold for  Pagan Legends  all the  Pagans  have published concerning Miracles Oracles of their Gods aereal Spectres Dreams and so many other  Prodigies as well as all the Papists obtrude upon us in that kind And he thinks it's clearly enough prov'd by all the Citations he has made in this Book that there are no Miracles Oracles Purgatories Apparitions of Spirits or Souls of Diabolical Arts and Illusions or Sorceries by Letters and Characters or of Choice of Days neither in  Judaism  nor  Papism  but draws its Origine from  Paganism  We must reject all at once or leave all to subsist together of what kind soever it be we ought to discharge our selves of all these Prejudices and joyn Reason with the Scriptures to ground our selves on them and look upon those alone as pure Sources  In his Second Volume  c  § he writes thus All the Learned agree that  Affirmanti incumbit probatio  but he that denies a thing or doubts only of it does enough when he alledges Reasons of his doubts and much more yet when he sifts and curiously examines those Reasons he might expect from the Persons concerned It's what he has resolved to do in this place first as to what has never been alledg'd by Reason and afterwards as to what has never been taught by the Scriptures  C  § He says That the Devil by the first Sin that was committed in Paradice is the Cause of all evil and consequently all the evil that is done ought with just Reason to be imputed to him And beneath You can find nothing that can prove that the Devil after having seduc'd Man at the beginning of the Creation has had since in Person the least Power on him or his Actions but indeed that all the evil that ever happen'd or is still committed in the World is consider'd by Reason  of this as if the Devil himself did it  C  § He says As for the Fall of Man it's certain it was caused by the Devil but to know the way how it's altogether uncertain  C  § He argues thus As it's manifest that that which has no Existence can produce nothing whence comes it that the Devils or unclean Spirits did those things which the Gospel mentions and by those that were possess'd by them I answer The pretended unclean Spirits are always named in case of Maladies and that so it was understood by those that were attaqued or infected with Diseases and Scourges of God that reign'd at that time And he says If you say the Apostles since Christ have not freed us from that Error that the  Daemons  are really such Spirits and that they have such a Power he answers This is not so easily granted because  Eidola  false Gods or Idols and the  Daimonia  are one and the same thing Now St  Paul  tells us that the Idols or false Gods are nothing at all  C  § He says As for  Angels  he does not deny but they have appear'd sometimes but he believes not so many Apparitions of the Devil § He owns there are Men that naturally see Spectres and Phantomes more often than others but he says it's the natural Disposition of the Body of the Man of his Blood and Spirits which makes him believe he really sees what he sees no farther than he believes  C  § He says He concludes that the Devil has not the least Knowledge of the World nor of the things that concern Religion nor of the Affairs of Faith  C  § He says He has shewn that  the Devil can do nothing in reality nor in appearance § He says The Angels are the Ministers of God in all Places both to Punish Men and to Protect and Defend them but as for the Devil he is God's Prisoner After which he has no more to say on this Matter  In his Third Volume  C  § He says The Question is not whether there are Enchantments or the like but what we ought to understand by Enchantments and in what it consists whether it be Deceit Subtlety Covert wickedness  c  or whether those they call Magicians really work by the Devil  C  § He says He is of Opinion That what the  Aegyptians  did was only in Appearance and nothing real  C  § He says If we think to fright People with  Spectres  to teach them so much more to fear God it's a miserable thing in Christianity that People must be brought to God by a servile Fear which naturally makes us fly God or that we serve him without love If it be with this Fear with which we ought to serve God has not  Christ  rendred us a poor Service for having delivered us  C  § As for those they call possess'd Persons he says He confesses he has no Knowledge of the least Operation of the Devil on the Body in the Body and by means of the Body no more than of those some will have him do on the Soul of Man for none of all these evil Spirits ever were or are in any place of all the Bible Devils so called but the evil Spirits were troublesome Torments and incurable Ills of which  Christ  cured many Persons by his sole Word and assisted the Apostles when they undertook to do it  In his Fourth Volume  C  § He says He has shewn that the Ancient  Magick  was nothing but surprize or imposture according to all the Scripture says of it § He says That all which Men think to be an Action of Spirits by Reason of the subtlety with which it's done is an effect of subtle and indivisible Substances The knowledge of the most subtle Matters and of the extent of their Motion may shew us that all that is commonly ascribed to Magick or the Operations of the Devil may be natural The most subtle Parts of Bodies entring in issuing forth and passing through Bodies are the Cause of all the Changes which happen § He says All he has said is to shew that there are sometimes very surprising things done whereof we cannot outwardly know the Causes and which nevertheless ought to be ascribed to the Motion assembling or separation of these little Bodies one way or other  C  § He says We shall now examine whether there has ever happened in the World that any thing of the Nature of those we call Apparitions Phantoms or Magick that ought not to be ascribed to those Atoms which often in moving themselves in separating or joyning themselves to one another can cause the same Aspects the same Sounds the same Motions in Men and about them that are ascribed to Spirits or the Devil in particular  C  § He says Men take the word Devil Satan Witch and Magick in quite another Sense than it's found in the Scripture searching with all the exactness Imaginable So much from Dr  Bekker    On what I have set forth from this Author a Man has room to write a large Volume but I shall contract my self in a little compass  As for this Persons undertaking from Scripture and Reason to introduce a new Doctrine amongst us concerning Evil Spirits contrary to what the whole stream of those Learned Teachers who have convey'd Religion to us have constantly taught us hitherto I think it may be look'd upon as a very bold and surprising attempt And I believe the Learned part of Christians will consider the Matter very maturely before they part with a Doctrine so long taught them  It seems to me a strange Confidence in Dr  Bekker  and indeed no less than that of  Socinus  and other Innovators that through a selfpresuming Conceit of his outdoing insight in the Scriptures he should now pretend to tell us That tho' he allows good Angels have appear'd sometimes yet there has been no Devil in the World since he tempted our first Parents to sin whereas the Scriptures every where speak as plainly of Evil Spirits and their Operations since the Fall as of Good Spirits Neither do I believe that any Person adhering to Dr  Bekker  's Doctrine will ever be able to assign the least Reason why God Almighty should have permitted the Devil to tempt Man before the Fall and not since And tho' Dr  Bekker  and Dr  Van Dale  have shewn themselves Men of Learning yet we know there have been many  Protestant  Divines since the Reformation who have given the World much greater  Specimens  of their Insight in the Oriental Languages which the others so much  pretend to for inabling them to a right understanding of the Scriptures who notwithstanding never took the words  Devil Satan Witch  and  Magick  in that sense they have done  But as for the Origin of Idolatry and the Doctrine of  Daemons  among the  Gentiles  I think no Man has better set it forth than  Kircher  in his  Oedipus Aegyptiacus  whom those Authors have not pleas'd to take notice of as I think it might have been proper for them he having given an account of it quite contrary to what they have writ This Man had all the Advantages that a great Writer could have He had great Natural Parts us'd great Industry had a great Correspondence with the Learned in most Parts of the World had the Command of near twenty Languages and the Favour of many great Princes who assisted him with all sorts of Books and other Necessaries for carrying on so great a Work in which he acquaints the World he spent Twenty Years Labour with a very intent Study  Pag    In his first Tome of his said Work he writes thus  St  Ambrose  wisely and truly says that Humane Error was the cause of Idolatry And with him  Hermes Trismegistus    Ad Asclep c    that the Origin of the detestable Idolatry of the  Aegyptians  was the Error and Incredulity of their Ancestors in which  Aegypt  always wallowed For as they did not apply their Minds with a due Reverence and Consideration to the Worship of the true God and the Divine Religion and nevertheless were possest with a desire of some Religion they found out the Art of making Idols but as they knew not how  to animate them using wicked Arts and Diabolical Conjurations and calling forth  Daemons  they forc'd them into them and to give them more Vertue and Strength they consecrated to them Animals of divers kinds which they called Sacred adoring in them the Souls of those Persons who have been Famous for Vertues and Facts they had perform'd calling by their Names those Cities that had been either built or instructed with wholsome Laws and Ordinances by them To their Honour also they instituted various Sacrifices which sort of Rites and Ceremonies  Mor Isaack  a  Maronite  most elegantly describes in his  Syrian Philosophy  as follows  Then arose Men of the Seed of  Cham  having corrupt Manners whose Minds were corrupted through Ignorance and  Daemons  that seduc'd them and they taught one thing for another and thought the Stars were endowed with a Spirit of Intelligence that they had a free Liberty and Power and by degrees the Devil made them Err till they thought the Stars to be Creators and Makers and they gave to each Star the Name of a God and they Worship'd them with various Ceremonies falling down before them and adoring them and they set up various Idols in their Names and plac'd them on the tops of High Pillars and Walls of Houses exhibiting their Figures after various Manners and to these they offer'd Victims and Sacrifices burning Incense before them and the Devil at certain times speaking from each of them gave Answers to those that ask'd them predicting future things and revealing things hidden and presently told of things that were  done in Places very remote and put Thoughts into their Minds which he revealed to others and he has seduc'd very many of those Men even to this Day Now these Rites were proper to the  Aegyptians  which afterwards passing to others infected by degrees the whole World  Now from what is here deliver'd by  Kircher  we find we may allow what Dr  Bekker  says  viz  That the  Eidola  false Gods or Idols and the  Diamonia  of the  Gentiles  are in a manner one and the same thing and say with St  Paul  that the Idols or false Gods are nothing at all for as the  Pagans  adored in their Idols the Souls of Persons that had been Famous for Vertues or great Actions done for the Benefit of Mankind or their suppos'd Spirits of the Stars these indeed were nothing there but as they apply'd themselves to these for receiving Answers they desired or for being otherwise gratifyed by them in other desires it was the Devil who deluded them in giving them Answers and doing other things as they desired so that their Conversation was with him who kept them in continual Idolatry though they did not direct their Worship directly to him  So again  Kircher  in his  Second Tome  of his said  Oedipus Part  treating of  Hieroglyphical Magick  in his Third Chapter which treats concerning the Divinations and Oracles of the  Aegyptians  sets forth that the Mind of Man being still agitated with a desire of the goods both of Body and Soul  P    seq  and eagerly wishing to secure them perpetually to himself applies its Study to the Knowledge of future things whence the Devil as being Enemy of Mankind  laying as many Snares as there are Appetites of Humane Machinations at length sets upon him with an Hope of the Knowledge of those future things Now there are two chief Nets he lays  Astrology  and  Polymancy  by the first he teaches the Lot which each Man has gotten from the first Minute of his Nativity as to a good or bad Fortune by the latter he presents as under the Veil of natural Causes various kinds of Divinations with which the uncautious while they unadvisedly go about to pursue Good and shun Evil are justly depriv'd of the eternal Good These Arts  Cham  the Son of  Noah  first introduc'd into the World by the Instigation of the Devil which the  Aegptians  instructed by  Cham  have transfus'd into the whole World as it were by a certain Hereditary Tradition As for their  Astrology  he has treated amply of it before and here he takes upon him to give an Account of their Divinations and their Origine and concerning the Nature of their Oracles  Before I give you an Account of what he says concerning the latter I shall give you two or three Particulars of what he says concerning their  Astrology    In his forementioned  Tome p  he writes thus I dare solemnly affirm that all our present  Judicial Astrology  relating to Nativities and horary Questions retains even to this Day that occult pact with Devils which the Ancient  Aegyptian Astrology  did  P  He says The  Aegyptians  did not so much ascribe to the Stars as to the  Genii  presiding in them the Events of things hence there was an earnest desire care and solicitude  to render them Propitious by previous Ceremonies and Sacrifices otherwise then the  Astrologers  of our Times deal who rashly ascribe the Fortune of Men to a certain fatal necessity of the Stars  P  He says The  Aegyptians  held that Gods or  Genii  inhabited the Stars for they thought the Inferior World depended on their Vertue and Efficacy not by the proper influsive force of the Stars but by the disposing Power of the Deities who being seated in the Stars as an Instrument for the Disposition of Inferiors  c  As for what is said more concerning their  Astrology  I refer the Reader to the Author  As for the  Aegyptians  Divinations and their Origine and the Nature of their Oracles they thought that beside the Celestial Gods there were certain middle Natures which they call'd  Angels Daemons Genii  or  Terrestrial Gods  to which they ascribed the rise and fall of their Oracles and so that the Oracles lasted so long as the said  Genii  continued in the  Statues  which deliver'd Oracles and that they ceas'd when the  Statues  were deserted by the  Genii  or  Daemons  Now they affirmed these  Genii  to Inhabit the Region betwixt the Heavens and the Earth and to consist of Herbs Stones Spices and other Terrestrial Matters containing a natural Power of a Divinity in them and that as living near us they were joyned to us by a friendly Alliance and they thought them to be affected with a singular Love towards Mankind according as their Nature bears predicting future things by Oracles and taking care of other things belonging to us Wherefore they entred  Statues  rightly prepared  by Men and gave Answers from them to those that consulted them and stayed in them many Years by so much the more willingly by how much the  Statues  were made of Matters more agreeing to them and by how much the more skilful they were to detain them by Sacrifices Hymns Prayers and Harmonies with which only Allurements of them they are delighted And  Trismegistus  in his  Pymander  says their Ancestors had not a perfect Knowledge of the celestial Deity for God being known they had not cared for terrestrial Gods but as being uncertain of him greatly straying from the Divine Religion they excogitated an Art whereby they might make Gods erecting  Statues  and as they could not create Souls for them they called the Souls of  Angels  or  Daemons  into them which came upon calling both because the Power of these Men was great and because  Angels  and  Daemons  have so great an Alliance with Men that they are drawn by a natural Obsequiousness to them  But to return to the Oracles they were the Root and Foundation of all Divinations and Superstition nor did the Devil always give Answers with a sensible Voice but discovered what he pleased by certain Signs Hence first arose the various kinds of Rites and Ceremonies with which as it were with previous Dispositions they were wont to purge the Mind that it might become conscious of future things then turning themselves to vain observances they took all the Ludibria of obvious things for Auguries But let us explain them in particular I find that in a manner in all the Prefectures of  Aegypt  there was an  Oracle from which Consulters received Answers concerning various Events not that every particular Oracle answered concerning every thing proposed to them but only concerning things agreeing to their Nature Thus the Oracle of  Serapis  about things that concerned Agriculture of  Anubis  of things relating to Sciences of  Horus  about things concerning the good of the Body and Soul of  Isis  about things concerning  Nilus  or Fertility but the Oracle of  Ammon  as being the most Famous of all gave Answers concerning all things proposed So in Innumerable other Places Oracles were set up all which gave Answers in obscure Places obsess'd by evil Spirits by a Voice Dreams a Gesture and a Nod of the  Statues  by a sound a ringing or other Signs and they were given either by the  Daemon  himself or by  Pythonists  or by Priests inspir'd with a Fatetelling Spirit which from Caves and obscure deep Vaults with an horrible sound and noise rush'd out on the Enthusiasts in the likeness of Fire with which being wholly surrounded and driven into a fury they uttered those things which the  Daemon  suggested to them with a Palpitation of all their Limbs their Eyes turn'd upwards and their Mouths distorted After this manner  Satan  the Architect of Superstitions insinuating himself by stealth into the Minds of Men by Idolatry made it his Business to inculcate to them devoted Services of Rites and Ceremonies by which they should Worship his Commentitious Gods under a pretext of Piety and Vertue that under these Colours he might involve and pollute them in all kinds of Impiety and Wickedness  and derive to himself the Honour due to God  And as there was nothing so obvious to our Senses which the  Daemon  did not assume as certain Signs to shew his Will and nilling to those that consulted him hence manifold kinds of Divinatory Magick arose hence issued the Spawn of all kinds of portentous Sorceries and Divinations  c  So far  Kircher    Now laying this before us I must say That notwithstanding all Dr  Van Dale  has writ concerning  Oracles  as being wholly contrived by the Impostures of Men I must wholly assent to what  Kircher  has here set forth concerning them and this not only because  Kircher  and others have so deliver'd it to us but chiefly because even at this Day there are Persons who upon casting themselves into a Trance and otherwise can and do predict future things reveal things hidden and tell of things done in Places very remote like to what was done by the Oracles as I have set forth in this Work which must be ascribed to the Agency of evil Spirits as I shall shew beneath  Indeed that many things in the  Aegyptian Oracles  were done by the Impostures of their Priests it's what  Kircher  freely owns in the Third  Tome  of his said  Oedipus  p where he writes as follows  We have shewn in several Parts of this Work that  Daemons  did not only speak from various  Statues  as from certain Oracles but that ev'n Priests themselves to keep the People in a greater cult and veneration towards the Gods impos'd on their Simplicity by thier Craft and the use of these  speaking Statues  was so frequent  in  Aegypt  that there was scarce a Prefecture without them and so that the chief end of the Priests seems to have consisted in this to draw  Daemons  by Magical Adjurations and various Incantations into  Statues  first consecrated by due Rights in the  Adyta  and being drawn to consult them concerning various Demands And because the  Daemons  did not always give Answers agreeing to Truth but wholly fool'd those that consulted them many ways hence the Priests performing the Office of a  Daemon  and applying themselves to Fraud made  Statues  with such an Artifice that by occult Pipes convey'd to the Head of the  St  tues  they mutter'd Voices as it were of the Gods and what Answers they pleas'd to impose on the Superstitious People who being deluded by this impious Cheat of the Priests were more and more animated to make Oblations and offer Gifts due as they thought to the Gods but in Truth to those deceitful Priests who thought they had done some great thing if what was done by the Craft of a fraudulent Wit obtain'd in the Minds of the simple People the Opinion of a Divine Work of the Gods and of a Miracle So far  Kircher    But to conclude from this with Dr  Van Dale  that all that pass'd in the Oracles of the Ancients was done by Humane Contrivance without any Agency of evil Spirits is what I can no way assent to for the Reason above giv'n  To return to Dr  Bekker  As to what he says That the Knowledge of the most subtle Particles of Matter and of the Extent of their Motion may shew us that all that is commonly ascrib'd to Magick and the Operations of the Devil may be Natural and  that all Apparitions and Phantomes Sounds  c  commonly ascribed to the Operations of  Daemons  may be caus'd by the Action of those Atoms I should ask'd him here whether the Action of those subtle Particles of Matter can exert it self to an intellectual and voluntary Agency for this is the true State of the Question and not to tell us that seemingly occult Sympathies and Antipathies and the like may be solv'd that way which we own may be true and I think I have sufficiently shewn in this Book in the foregoing several Heads of Mens preception of Spirits that the Actions I there ascribe to Spirits have resulted from intellectual and voluntary Agents If he should say the Actions of such subtle Particles could arise to such Agency I think I have fairly shewn before from Mr  Lock  and Monsieur  le Cl  r  that the Notions of Matter and of an intellectual and voluntary Agent are clearly distinct and incommunicable to each other  Again As for his raising the Action of the Particles of Matter to this pitch this would equally take away the Operations of good Spirits as well as evil whereas he allows the former So that I think he had been more consonant to his Principles in setting up for Sadducism or Epicurism denying both good and evil Spirits than to take up with this halfspirited Opinion which I know not whether any Man has ever held but himself  Indeed we may allow what Dr  Bekker  says That good Angels may sometimes Punish Men by God's Appointment as well as protect and defend them but we say there have been frequent manifestations of wicked Facts done by Spirits and such as could no way  consist with the Nature of good Angels therefore there must be allowed of both Kinds unless the  Doctor  's subtle Particles shall solve all And whereas in his  Second Volume  he says The Facts ascribed to Spirits  Chap    Sect    are perhaps such as a Man's Spirit can do as when a Man possess'd with a pretended evil Spirit speaks strange Languages which he had never Learned before this he says may be solv'd if we embrace the Opinion of  Justin viz  that the Souls of the Dead can enter into the Bodies of the Living for then he says Why may it not be that the Soul of a Man skill'd in many Languages is that which after the Death of its Body speaks by the means of that which is yet alive those same Languages he had learned Living But he says He is not of this Opinion though this may suffice to convince those by what they say themselves that confound one thing with another in believing this of the Soul and that there are Angels for the same Reason which Experience proves not that there are or that they exist  Now as to this since the  Doctor  did not hold the Opinion of  Justin  nor deny that strange Languages had been spoken by Ignorant Persons he might have done well to have explain'd how that could be done without the Agency of Spirits and as for his charging those with an inconsistency that hold this Opinion and with all the Agency of Spirits is it that because some particular Person has set up such an Hypothesis for solving that Fact there must be no Spirits So we know that  Marcus Marci  who generally takes upon him to solve all  Phaenomena  without God Angel or Devil has set up another Hypothesis  for solving the said Fact he supposes that Ideas are convey'd into all Persons with the seminal Principles derived from Parents and Ancestors and that when these Ideas upon certain critical Junctures come to an Evolution a Man may come to speak any of those Languages which any of his Ancestors were skilled in But what if Men set up such Hypothesis the Question will still be whether these Hypothesis are more cogent upon our understanding for their Admittance than that of Spirits or whether our Reason acquiesces more easily in them  And I think  Apol    I may here justly charge these Men as  Justin Martyr  does others in a like Case saying Some oppose to us  M  rcion  who even now teaches Men to deny God the Maker of all things in Heaven and Earth and Christ his Son predicted by the Prophets and introduces another God beside the Maker of all things and also another Son by whose Authority many being sway'd they deride us as though he were the only Man that knew Truth and as they have no Demonstration of those things they say without all Reason being seized as Lambs by a Wolf they become the foul prey of Mens  Dogma  's and of Devils  Tandlerus  in his Answer to a Question propos'd concerning the Divination and other wonderful Effects of Melancholick Persons first tells us that those Melancholick Facts or Energies may be reduc'd to two kinds one is of those who are said to have spoken Languages of which while they were themselves they were wholly Ignorant or to have shewn an understanding of those Arts which they never acquired to themselves by Learning the  other is of those who are said to have had a certain Power and Faculty of discovering occult things of commemorating past things that were unknown to them and of predicting future Events whose Truth experience it self at length has shewn to be so To the first kind belongs that rustick mentioned by  Guainerius  who always the Moon being combust made Verses and the combustion being pass'd about two Days till she came to another combustion could not speak a word of  Latin  and this Man had never Learned Letters And here that Saylers Boy has place who as  Forestus  tells having received a Blow on his Head as he pass'd a Bridge in his  Delirium  always made  Syllogisms  in the  German Tongue  and that excellently and that afterwards being cur'd he knew not how to do it  Of the latter kind we have  Rhasis  a Witness among the  Arabians  and  Alexander  who was in no mean rank among the Ancient Physicians and among these Persons he thinks we may not unfitly place  Exstaticks    Now he says There is a very great Dissention among Authors in assigning the Causes of these stupendious Actions of Persons seized with a Melancholy Distemper some laboriously inquire into the natural Causes of them others ascend to Supernatural as for those who acquiesce in natural Causes he finds two Sects of them The first is of  Astrologers  ascribing all the Works of Melancholick Persons to the Influences of the Stars as  Gu  inerius  does building on certain  Platonick  and  Astrological Principles  he says That the Soul before it's infus'd into the Body contains the Knowledge of all things in it self but that it's in a manner abolish'd by the Union  with the Body with whose Fetters it's held ensnared after it's infused nor can it be otherwise recovered but by teaching or by an influx or impression of the Planet which presided over his Nativity at the very time the Soul was infused into the Body He will have the force of this impression to be so great that it may endow the Soul with a Faculty of producing such Actions as the Star is wont to produce elsewhere so that it may make a well Man sick and a sick Man well also cause Snow and Rain but that the Body and corporeal Senses resist this Impression especially as to Knowledges it being otherwise of efficacy enough in it self these Senses therefore being bound as it happens in Melancholick Persons and the Star working on the Soul without resistency it comes to pass that the Soul understands all things without Discourse foresees future things answers concerning Arts to which it inclines by the force of the influencing Planet The second Sect is of natural Philosophers who seeing that the Minds of Men are variously affected with the Melancholick Humour and that most that have excelled others in Understanding or in Learning Arts or in Administration of Government or in performing other things were naturally Melancholick they stuck not to ascribe so great force to it for as there are many found who are naturally enclined to divers Arts so Melancholy they say is naturally inclined to Work wonderful things and as high fermented Wine immoderately taken changes Mens Manners and Causes them to differ from themselves so they contend that if the Melancholick Juice exceeds its convenient  Measure in a Person or be rendred more hot or cold than is fitting gets a certain singular force wholly to change the Mind and to stir up wonderful Motions in it  Now  Tandlerus  after having stated these Opinions rejects them for though he does not deny the Power of the Stars for changing the temperament of the whole Body and of each of its Parts in particular and for giving an Inclination either for the Knowledge of Tongues or for divers Disciplines yet this he stifly denies that the very Knowledge of Tongues is any way conferr'd by the Stars without teaching or their use without any precedent Knowledge for certain Reasons he gives nor can he acquiesce in their Opinion who think these kinds of Prodigies ought to be ascribed to the property of the Melancholick Humour for though there be a certain occult force of the Melancholick Juice that it may produce Operations causing Admiration yet it cannot be so great as to beget a Knowledge of Languages and of occult and future things these certainly are owing to a superior Cause not that while he denies these things to have place in the Melancholick Humour he therefore denies what  Aristotle  says  viz  that Melancholick Persons are  that is have direct Dreams by which they may have a forepreception of certain future things for there are two kinds of Divination one natural common to Men with Brutes whereby without Discourse by the sole guidance of Nature some Animals have a 'foresense of things as well for avoiding hurtful things themselves as for admonishing Men of certain iminent Events so Ants have  a natural 'foresense of the approaching Winter from the going away of Sparrows many Physicians believe we are admonish'd of an approaching Pestilence such a presaging faculty is often found in some Fools who by Nature have a vitiated Reason in whom doubtless Nature makes a recompence one way for what it takes away in another So  Marcus Maci  says  Those whose Minds are employed in Speculations  Phil vet Rest par    Sect    which take up the Soul do not easily perceive sympathetical Impressions whence presaging and predictions are wont to be sent to simple Persons rather than to Wise Men and that happens much more to brute Animals than no Men those being presently filled with the celestial Image being void of any of their own  The same things haply sometimes occur in Melancholick Persons especially in those whom Nature has particularly brought forth such The other kind is Artificial which is grounded on an observation of Events or on certain Signs and because it consists for the greatest part in a comparing together of natural Causes as well betwixt themselves as of the Effect it is also called Natural though this depends of certain Rules yet the Inclination of Nature which proceeds partly from the temperament and Humours and partly from a fortunate and meet position of certain Stars hold the chief place in it for we see some by a peculiar guidance of Nature being cultivated with an indifferent knowledge of the Stars far more truly and readily to hit out future things from obvious or little previous Marks than those who excel only in Art being destitute of the Aids of Nature Nay some by this very force of Spirit arrive at a full insight in many things  which Art with Labour would not come to the Knowledge of or attain with Difficulty Such a Facility of conjecturing since it happens for the most part in Persons inclin'd to Melancholy which happily may be increas'd by a fortunate Concourse of the Stars I easily grant that Melancholick Persons are not only  but likewise that they excel others in the Prediction of future Things But here we speak of another kind of Divination when Ignorant Persons without Conjectures and Observation of Events bring secret Things to light Prophesie of those future Things which are neither known to themselves nor others nay when they come to themselves they know not that any such thing was done by them These things he says he judges could no way arise from an Humour especially exceeding the Bounds of Nature  He concludes therefore That the Devil is the Author of all these things tho' not alone but join'd with the Melancholick Humour which he exagitates at his pleasure and causes certain Operations which that Humour had not been able to produce by its own force  Since we are upon this Point of Ignorant Peoples speaking unknown Languages I shall give you one particular Instance of it taken from a Letter sent by the late Lord  Lauderdale  to Mr  Baxt  r  which Letter was printed  Anno  in Mr  Baxter  's  Historical Discourse of Apparitions and Witches  He there writes among other things as follows  I shall here tell you of a real Possession near the place where I was born About thirty Years ago when I was a Boy at School there was a poor Woman generally believ'd  to be really possess'd She liv'd near the Town of  Duns  in the  Mers  and Mr  John Weems  then Minister of  Duns  a Man known by his Works to be a Learned Man and I know him to be a Godly Honest Man was perswaded she was possess'd I have heard him many times speak with my Father about it and both of them concluded it a real Possession Mr  Weems  visited her often and being convinc'd of the truth of the thing he with some neighbour Ministers apply'd themselves to the King's PrivyCouncil for a Warrant to keep Days of Humiliation for her but the Bishops being then in Power would not allow any Fasts to be kept I will not trouble you with many Circumstances one I shall only tell you which I think will evince a real Possession The report being spread in the Country a  Knight  by the Name of  Forbes  who liv'd in the  North  of  Scotland  being come to  Edenborough  meeting there with a Minister of the  North  and both of them desirous to see the Woman the Northern Minister invited the  Knight  to my Father's House which was within ten or twelve Miles of the Woman whither they came and next Morning went to see the Woman They found her a poor Ignorant Creature and seeing nothing extraordinary the Minister says in  Latin  to the  Knight Nondum audivimus Spiritum loquen  em  presently a Voice comes out of the Womans Mouth  Audis loquentem audis loquentem  This put the Minister into some amazement which I think made him not mind his own  Latin  he took off his Hat and said  Misere  ur D  s peccatoris  The Voice presently out of the  Woman's Mouth said  Dic peccatricis Dic peccatricis  whereupon both of them came out of the House fully satisfied took Horse immediately and return'd to my Father's House at  Thirlestane Castle  in  Lauderdale  where they related this Passage This I do exactly remember Many more Particulars might be got in that Country but this  Latin Criticism  in a most Illiterate Ignorant Woman where there was no pretence to dispossessing is Evidence enough I think  So far the Lord  Lauderdale    This leads us to consider another Assertion of Dr  Bekker  's where he says that all the Possessions mention'd in the Scriptures were but incurable Diseases that tormented Men the Devil having nothing to do in them and of which Christ cur'd many Persons by his sole Word  As to this  Gulielmus Adera  Physician of  Tolouse  Printed a Book there  Ann  concerning the Diseases and Diseas'd cur'd by Christ In the third Part of this Book he enquires how the Devil becomes the external Cause of many Diseases  He there tells us that those Persons whom Christ cur'd were such as the Interpreters of the Scriptures call  Energumens  or such as were possest with an Evil Spirit concerning whom it's a Crime to doubt Nay he says those strive and contend against all Truth Faith Experience and the Authority of most Wise and Pious Men who obstinately deny those  Energumens  and Persons obsest and possest with the Devil and set nought by of the vexatious Power the Devil has in moving natural Causes and if the obsest do any thing excessively  violent or stupendious believe it to be and ascribe it to Melancholy preternaturally mov'd in the Brain or the whole Body These Men bring it so to pass that by understanding they understand nothing who exploding the Power of  Daemons  accuse all ancient Writers and all the Fathers of the Christian Church whose Negligence he should rather choose to imitate than the unaccountable Diligence of those Men  To distinguish Persons possest from those infested with a melancholick Enthusiasm he says the learned Physician  Massaria  gives two Signs which are most certain Marks of a demoniacal seizure First if a Rustick or Ideot speaks Greek or Latin Secondly if he predicts future Things Now it is not to be doubted but these things have been often observ'd in melancholick Persons by  Levinus Lemnius  and others  In Lib Fern de abd rer ca  s  Riolanus  brings Reasons for it and an Instance in  Philaretus  of  Spoletto  who being infested with Worms fell into a new kind of Madness so that in his Disease he spake very well the  German Tongue Huartus  in his  Scrutinium Ingeniorum  tells us of a Woman seiz'd with a Frenzy in a great Fever who spake  Latin  and predicted many things as a Prophet She predicted to a  Chirurgion  who let her Blood that he would die within a Month and that his Wife would after Marry a Neighbour Smith which fell out accordingly  Psellus  also tells us of a Woman who being ill after Childbearing spake in the  Armenian Tongue  with a certain  Armenian Physician  tho' she had never seen an  Armenian  before and knew nothing but her Chamber and Distaffe  He thinks every Man knows it to be a great and difficult Task to distinguish melancholick Persons from such as are possest No Man as far as he knows having as yet given us true Marks of it He says therefore that a Man must inspect the Nature Manners Humours and Disposition of the Diseas'd What he does beside the usual Nature of the Disease and of the Nature of its Symptoms as to cry out violently to be vehemently agitated and tortur'd to contract wrest or extend his Limbs without a manifest Convulsion to be Delirious without a Frenzy to speak prodigious Things and use an unusual Tongue In short to do or suffer those things which are very unusual in Diseases  These things being discover'd as far as a Physician may he must explain how the Devil becomes the cause of Diseases how he acts with natural Causes entangles the Body in Distempers stirs up Symptoms with such Enormity that it may be justly doubted whether it be a monstrous Disease or a severe  Daemon  And he concludes with the unanimous Assertion of Divines and Physicians that it's done by the Devil's managing of the Humours at his Pleasure in those that are left to him whereby he can cause an Epilepsie Palsie and the like Diseases as also Blindness Deafness  c  If any one wonders why he awakens and stirs up Fits of Diseases according to the Motion and Quarters of the Moon he says it's because at that time the Humours being encreas'd by the Motion and Influence of the Moon are more conveniently agitated  And in his  th Ch  of his said  Third Part  treating concerning the Difference of an  Epilepsie  from a divine  Exstasie  and that which proceeds from the Devil he says a divine  Exstasie  is a sacred rapt of the Mind in which God by a Condescent presents himself to any humane Creature not by the means of any Disease or other preternatural morbifick Cause the Doctrine of Divines being that God insinuates himself into our Minds by a Rapt and then shews us by a divine Representation those Things he pleases we shall see Therefore it is really God who forcibly draws Man to him by an  Exstasie  no natural Cause nor the Mind spontaneously mov'd for as the Sun is not seen without the Sun so neither can God be known without God  If you had seen the Prophets or others rapt in  Exstacies  you would have been apt to say they were fallen into an Apoplectick or Epileptick Seisure for they remain'd immovable their Eyes open and fixt towards Heav'n their Faces pale either standing upright or being on their Knees till being fill'd with the light of Celestial Visions and saturated with a feast of holy Thoughts they return'd to themselves But it's easie to distinguish these from Epileptical Persons and we shall shew that extatical Persons and such as are rapt by a  Daemon  are not Epileptical  Christian Divines and Physicians agree that  Daemons  stir up Raptures and Exstasies in Men binding or loosing the exterior Senses and that either stopping the Pores of the Brain that the Spirits do not pass forth as it's done naturally by Sleep or by recalling the sensitive Spirits from the outward Senses to the inward  Organs which he there retains so the Devil renders Women Witches exstatical and Magicians who while they lie fast asleep in one place being deceiv'd they think they have been in various places and done many things  That these Exstasies are not Epileptick Seisures it appears from  Bodin  in his  Theatre of universal Nature  where he says That those that are rapt by the Devil feel neither Stripes nor Cuttings nor no wresting of their Limbs nor burning Torches nor the burning of a red hot Iron Nay nor is the beat of the Pulse nor the Motion of the Heart perceiv'd in them but afterwards returning to themselves they feel most bitter Pains of the Wounds receiv'd and tell of things that were done at Miles distance and affirm themselves to have seen them done So far  Bodin    An  Exstasie  therefore is an Abolishment of Sense and Motion and not a Depravation of it as in an Epileptick Seisure for Persons in an  Exstasie  lie wholly immoveable in an Epileptick Fit they are most violently agitated And as  Bodin  says Demoniacal Exstaticks breath forth an horrid stink Epilepticks foam at the Mouth and their Seed and Excrements pass from them thro' a violent Agitation of the Muscles and infinite Evils which Demoniacks commit in their Raptures shew that they were not agitated with a Convulsion but gave themselves too much to the Devil's Covenants Nor need I say much concerning the difference betwixt a  Madness  a  Syncope  and a  Stupor  caus'd by narcotick Medicines and an  Exstasie  For as  Bodin  rightly argues a Mad  Man is always agitated without ceasing and a Man rapt in an  Exstasie  lies immoveable destitute of all Sense and Motion of all his Parts and rather like a Man seiz'd with an Apoplexy A  Syncope  is a sudden failing of all the Strength and soon ends in Death or a Recovery an  Exstasie  lasts a long time without the loss of a Man's Strength A  Stupor  caus'd by narcotick Medicines takes away Sense not Motion for otherwise Motion being abolish'd together with Sense Death would be at Hand therefore a  Stupor  is not  Exstasie  So far Dr  Ader    To this I may add  Inst med l    p    Sec    c    what  Sennertus  writes of the  Demoniacal Sopor  of Witches who think they are carried through the Air Dance Feast have Copulation with the Devil and do other things in their sleep and afterwards believe the same things waking Now he says whether they are really so carried in the Air  c  or being in a profound sleep only dream they are so carried and persist in that Opinion after they are awake these Facts or Dreams cannot be natural for it cannot be that there should be so great an Agreement in Dreams of Persons differing in Place Temperament Age Sex and Studies that in one Night and at the same Hour they should Dream of one such Meeting and should clearly agree of the Place Number and Quality of the Persons and the like Circumstances But such Dreams are suggested from a supernatural Cause  viz  from the Devil to his Confederates God permitting it Whence also to those Witches seriously converted and refusing to be longer present at those Meetings such Dreams no longer happen which is a  Mark that they proceeded not before from a natural Cause  Schottus  in his Book  De Mirabilib  s Energumenorum  gives us some signs for knowing  Daemoniacks  and first he says A revealing of occult things which surpass the natural Knowledge of the Revealers is a probable sign of a Possession unless we may rationally presume it to be from God or a good Angel And this because since that revealing must necessarily be suggested from some Mind or Spirit and it is not from the private Spirit of the Man since it surpasses his natural Knowledge nor from God or a good Spirit as it's prudently suppos'd of necessity it must proceed from an Evil Spirit He says it's a probable sign not certain since that revealing may be caus'd by  Daemons  not possessing a Person as it appears by many Histories But if there are other signs it's a Presumption that the revealing in the said Circumstances is from a Daemoniacal Possession  Secondly  He says a Skill in and speaking of unknown Tongues which the Speaker never learnt is also a probable Sign of a Possession if it may not otherwise be rationally presum'd that it is from God or a good Angel because it cannot naturally be that a Person ignorant of a Tongue should speak it since we learn not foreign Tongues but with great Labour The same is to be understood of the Knowledge of Reading Writing Singing and of the Knowledge of other Sciences if a Person had never learnt them  Levinus Lemnius  therefore lies under a Mistake where he tells us that melancholick Persons and such as are in a frenzie thro' a fervent ebullition of the Humours  and a vehement agitation of the Spirits may speak various Languages tho' before they knew nothing of them  Schottus  there sets forth many other Signs of  Daemoniacks  tho' not so certain as the former and he sets forth also the Signs giv'n by  Voetius  and others of them for which I refer you to his Book  This I think is enough in answer to Dr  Bekker  's Assertion that the Devil has nothing to do in Diseases  As for the Cavils of many Writers against the possibility of a covenanting Witch I am throughly convinc'd that if an Apparition presents itself to any Person as many have to my self if that Person be fallen from God and sunk into despair thro' the Miseries of human Life having not that Christian Armour on which St  Paul  speaks of he may make a Covenant with him as well as with a Man and if they say there can be no Covenant with a Spirit how comes it that there has has been a Covenant betwixt God and Man  There is one Point of Dr  Bekker  's Doctrine which remains to be answer'd where he says if we think to fright People with  Spectres  to teach them so much the more to love God it's a miserable thing in Christianity that People must be brought to God by a servile Fear instead of Love  Now this seems not to me so extraordinary a Lesson in Divinity for as we know the Love of God to be the consummation of Wisdom so the Fear of God is the beginning of it and I think a servile Fear still necessary to the generality of Mankind for Parents have Rods for their Children Masters for their  Scholars Princes for their Subjects and tho' all three would persuade those under them to do what they are enjoyn'd for Love yet such generally is the reluctancy of humane Nature from doing what is enjoyn'd it thro' an exorbitancy of our Passions that till these are broken by a Christian or Philosophical Training or we are come to a clearness of Judgment by a long Practice and Experience in the Affairs of humane Life Love alone will not do and the servile Fear of those Rods must be upheld and the Scriptures teach us that we must be content with the Bond Woman for a while till we may deserve to Marry the Free Woman  Thus I think I have sufficiently answer'd what has been stated from Dr  Bekker  But there is one thing remains for me to take notice of in him In his fourth  Volume  he has taken upon him to examine the Proofs that are brought from Experience for the Existence and Operations of  Daemons  and to refute them I have intimated before how groundlesly he has there rejected the  Daemons  of  Tedworth  and  Mascon  and here I shall observe how he rejects what is said of the  Piper at Hamelin  He tells us that his Master  Schookius  has refuted that Story in his little Book in Latin Entituled  Fabula Hamelensis  of whose Reasons he leaves the Reader to judge and adds many Suggestions of his own against it  Part    Sec      Now  Frommannus  in his third Book of  Magical F  s  ination  after having given us the Relation of this  Piper    De praeser D  m c    as it's set down by  Kircher  and  Schottus  and after having told us that  Wierus  says This Story is entred in the publick Records of the Town and Painted in  the Church Windows of which himself was an Eye Witness and that the Magistrate there was wont to date the publick Acts from the Year of the going forth of their Children together with the Year of Christ and that its observed even to this Day in Mark of the Fact that the Sound of a  Timbrel  is never admitted in that Street by which the Boys went forth if any Bride hap'ly be led forth that way till she be gone forth nor is dancing permitted there I say after having set forth this he says That  Martin Schookius  strongly endeavoured in a peculiar little Book to rank this story among fabulous Relations but  Theo Kirchmeierus  egregiously shammed all his effort in a peculiar Disputation at  Witteberg Anno    Now Dr  Bekker  has not been so Candid as to take notice of this in  Frommannus  as he ought to have done he having read  Frommannus  as it appears by his quoting him in his th Volume  c    I could add much more against Dr  Bekker  but this shall suffice at present  And now before I make an end in regard that in the front of my Book I have promis'd some Account of my particular Experience as to a sensible Perception of Spirits perhaps it may be expected from me that I should set forth some more particulars than I have yet done concerning it As to this I shall only say that in regard I do not urg  my own Experience as Argumentative for proving the existency of Spirits and their Operations I think it may be looked upon as a thing of more Curiosity than Use to enlarge upon it though I shall add the following particulars relating to it  I declare then with all the Sincerity of a Christian that it never so much as entred into my Thoughts to use any practice for raising or calling Spirits as some Men have done and that when they came it was altogether a surprize to me At their first coming they did not appear to me nor come into my Chamber but kept at my Chamber Windows and in a Court adjoyning to one of my Chamber Windows and in a Garden adjoyning to another Window They called to me sung play'd on Musick rung Bells sometimes crowed like Cocks  c  and I have great Reason to believe these to be all good Spirits for I found nothing in them tending to ill their drift in coming as far as I could perceive being only to compose my Mind and to bring it to its highest Purity they used no Threats to me but the surprize kept always a Terror upon me and they continued with me about two Months  Their second coming to me was some Years after when at first there came Five as I have set forth in my Fourth Chapter and presently after there came Hundreds and I saw some of them Dance in a Ring in my Garden and Sing holding Hands round not facing each other but their Backs turned to the inner part of the Circle I found these of a promiscuous Nature some good and some bad as among Men for some of them would now and then Curse and Swear and talk loosely and others would reprehend them for it Yet none of these ever perswaded me to any ill thing but all would disswade me from drinking too freely and any other irregularity and if at any time I was upon  going to any Neighbouring Town they would tell me they would go with me which I found they did for they would there call at my Curtain by my Beds side as they usually did at my House and talk to me  Beside these two great Visitations they have come to me now and then for some Years and sometimes have stay'd with me a Week sometimes two or three Days and all along from their first coming they have very often suggested things to me in my Dreams as now and then they do still At their first coming I heard no name of any of them mentioned as I did at their second coming I had a perception of them by four of my Senses for I saw them heard them and three of them had a dark smoak coming out of their Mouths which seemed somewhat offensive to the Smell it being like the smoak of a Lamp and three of them bid me take them by the Hand which I did but it yielded to my touch so that I could not find any sensible resistency in it neither could I perceive any coldness in them as it's said some Apparitions have had I did not ask them many curious Questions as I find many Men think I should and as they say they would have done but I always kept me on my guard and still requir'd them to be gone and would not enter into such Familiarily with them Indeed I ask'd them once what Creatures they were and they told me they were an Order of Creatures superior to Mankind and could Influence our Thoughts and that their Habitation was in the Air I ask'd them also several things relating to my own concerns in this World and I found sometimes both in their Answers and in what  they suggested in my Dreams things very surprizing to me One of them lay down upon my Bed by me every Night for a considerable time and pretended great kindness to me and if some others at any time would threaten  me that Spirit told me they should do me no hurt  If you ask me whether I really think these Apparitions to be Spirits or only an effect of Melancholy I can only say what St  Paul  said of the Nature of his Rapture God knows I know not but they appear'd to me Real  Tandlerus  in his  Dissertation concerning Melancholy  tells us That the affect of Melancholy chiefly happens to Persons from the Fortieth to the Sixtieth Year of their Age and that it's contracted chiefly in the Summer and Autumn and comes to an Head in the Spring and I must own that I was above Forty Years of Age before any thing in this kind happen'd to me but it was about  Christmas  that the Apparitions came to me both times  As for Melancholy I know not whether my Temperament may have some allay of it but I think I carry more of a Sanguine Indeed there was this that might help to exalt the other When they first came to me I was just upon a recovery from an intermittent Fever which had held me above twelve Months and I confess at that time I was unfortunately involv'd in an unnatural Suit in Law with a too near Relation which might somewhat discompose my Mind and at the Spirits second coming that suit in Law was continued and I cannot say but at that time I might have been somewhat affected by that saying of the Wise Man  Prov    Si Dedas te vino oculi tui  videbunt extraneas nempe visiones mirabiles Apparitiones  as  Lavaterus  explains it  De Spect l    c    but it's much if such an occasion should cause them to continue then with me above three Months  I could add many more particulars of what pass'd betwixt the Spirits and my self for indeed I kept a Journal of it for some Years as well for what pass'd in my Dreams as otherwise but I shall forbear to trouble the Reader farther only adding that as these Visitations of Spirits gave me an occasion to consider how far Humane Reason could bear as to a making out of the Existence of Spirits and their Operations so I must declare I firmly believe that as the whole visible World has proceeded from the invisible World which will hold good even according to the  Epicurean  Doctrine so that Spirits both good and bad are concern'd in the Administration of it as Agents subordinate to the first Cause and this I adhere to as well by a  Medium  of Reason as that of Faith in which I think we are all bound to acquiesce And it appears plain enough to me that those that will not so do will but lose themselves in a vertiginous  Doxomania  and never center in any solid Truth  A POSTSCRIPT  HAving lately had the Honour to hear a Relation of an Apparition from the Lord Bishop of  Gloucester  and it being too late for me to insert it in its proper place in this Book I give it you here by way of Postscript as follows  Sir  Charles Lee  by his first Lady had only one Daughter of which she died in ChildBirth and when she was Dead her Sister the Lady  Everard  desir'd to have the Education of the Child and she was by her very well Educated till she was Marriageable and a Match was concluded for her with Sir  William Perkins  but was then prevented in an extraordinary manner Upon a  Thursday  Night she thinking she saw a Light in her Chamber after she was in Bed knock'd for her Maid who presently came to her and she ask'd why she left a Candle burning in her Chamber The Maid said she left none and there was none but what she brought with her at that time Then she said it was the Fire but that her Maid told her was quite out and said she believ'd it was only a Dream whereupon she said it might be so and compos'd her self again to sleep but about two of the Clock she was awaken'd again and saw the Apparition of  a little Woman between her Curtain and her Pillow who told her she was her Mother that she was Happy and that by Twelve of the Clock that Day she should be with her whereupon she knok'd again for her Maid called for her Clothes and when she was dress'd went into her Closet and came not out again till Nine and then brought out with her a Letter sealed to her Father brought it to her Aunt the Lady  Everard  told her what had happen'd and desir'd that assoon as she was Dead it might be sent to him but the  Lady  thought she was suddenly fall'n Mad and thereupon sent presently away to  Chelmsford  for a Physician and Surgeon who both came immediately but the Physician could discern no Indication of what the Lady imagin'd or of any Indisposition of her Body notwithstanding the  Lady  would needs have her let Blood which was done accordingly and when the Young Woman had patiently let them do what they would with her she desir'd that the Chaplain might be called to read Prayers and when Prayers were ended she took her  Gittar  and  Psalm Book  and sate down upon a Chair without Arms and play'd and sung so melodiously and admirably that her MusickMaster who was then there admired at it and near the stroke of Twelve she rose and sate her self down in a great Chair with Arms and presently fetching a strong Breathing or two immediately Expired and was so suddenly cold as was much wondred at by the Physician and Surgeon She dyed at  Waltham  in  Ess  x  three Miles from  Chelmsford  and the Letter  was sent to Sir  Charles  at his House in  Warwickshire  but he was so afflicted with the Death of his Daughter that he came not till she was Buried but when he came caus'd her to be taken up and to be buryed by her Mother at  Edminton  as she desir'd in her Letter This was about the Year or  And this Relation the Lord Bishop of  Gloucester  had from Sir  Charles Lee  himself  FINIS
