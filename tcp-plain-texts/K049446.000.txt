 THE STATE OF THE EXCISE After the UNION COMPARED With what it is Now  Printed in the Year MDCCVI  THE State of the Excise After the UNION compar'd with what it is now  THE burden of the  English  Taxes industriously buzzed about into the Ears of the Commonalty by such as upon other Views were prejudiced against the present Treaty of Union has no doubt contributed in a great measure to work them into so general a ferment against it Their weakness and incapacity to inquire into and examine these Matters joined with some mean prejudices from the fear of losing the Crown and the like made them a subject very easy to be wrought upon this way  That the Design might have the better Success all methods have been used to scrue up these Burdens to extravagant heights that their appearance might be more frightful It cannot be denied that in an Affair of this moment to set Matters in their due light was the duty of every Person that ventured to give the Publick his Opinion but to fish for ways to magnify things seems to have had some other End than the real Service of the Nation  To give a fair and distinct view and to rectify Mistakes as to these on Liquors is the design of the following Sheet For understanding of which the Reader is desired to be informed of the following Particulars  The  English  Barrel of Beer or Ale containing  English  Gallons by  Stat  W M  cap  Contains Gallons  Scots  Every such Barrel of above  shillings  value pays of Excise  lib    shil Scots  Every such Barrel of  shillings  value or under pays of Excise  shil Scots  Of every such Barrels there is an allowance of Barrels or an th part for leakage  After deduction of an th part as the allowance for leakage the Excise of  Scots  Pint of Ale above  shill  value is scarce  pennies Scots  and a half or  pennies  on the Gallon  After deduction of the allowance above the Excise of  Scots  Gallon of Ale at  shillings  value or under is not full  pennies  per Gallon  but for easier counting shall be supposed  pennies  or  pennies  per Pint  The Excise in  Scotland  is  pennies  on the Pint without distinction  The Town of  Edinburgh Leith Glasgow  and some others have grants of a Duty of  pennies  on the Pint of Ale vended in their Privileges  The Brewer allows the Retailer Pint to every Gallon and Barrel to every for which Profits some sell at the price they lay at  The Retailer pays  pennies  for the Ale sold ordinarly at  shil Scots  Ale above  pennies Scots  per  Scots  Pint of nea  and clear value to the Brewer will fall under the Excise of strong Ale  order to discover which value with regard to our present two penny Ale the following compute will direct  Price of a Pint of two penny Ale to the Brewer    pennies  Deduce on account of the Barrel to the score    penny  On account of the Pint to the Gallon  ½  penny  For the Excise to the Queen    pennies  In  Edinburgh c  for the Towns duty    pennies  Total to be deduced  ½  penny  Rests the clear price of  Pint of two penny Ale to the Brewer  ½  penny  This Ale being above  shil sterl  value the  Gallons add to the foresaid price the Excise of strong Ale  ½  penny  Summa is    pennies  Add pennies for the Barrel to the score and the Pint the to Gallon    pennies  The Brewers price from the Retailer is    pennies  Allowing the Retailer the common profit of  d    pennies  Then Ale of the goodness of the present  Edinburgh  two penny Ale might in the Country be sold at    pennies  In  Edinburgh  by the foresaid Calcul Adding the Towns Duty the Brewer would Sell such Ale without allowances at    Pennies  And with Allowances computed at ½ Pennies at  ½  Pennies  Thus the Retailer would Sell such Ale at  ½  Pennies  Or for more easy division at    Pennies  BY the above Calcul it appears how little ground there is for the common Report spread about the country o  our two  Penny  Ale being doubled in its Price since supposing  the Excise to be Exacted in its Rigour it hightens the Price only ½  Pennies per  Pint or at most And considering that the Excise in  England  is managed by Collection t cannot be thought the Surveys will be so severe as here where the Farming the Excise by Roup Screws up its Price and the Taxmen for their own gain Squeeze the poor People to the outmost Law allows if not beyond it  This being the state of the  English  Excise with regard to Ale above  sh sterl per  Barrel the lesser Excise supposed largely to be  Pennies per  Pint falls next to be considered As to which that we shall be easier is obvious since the smallest Ale we can Brew now pays  Pennies per  Pint and Ale of  Pennies  true Price to the Brewer which falls under the lesser Excise not being a full fourth part weaker then the present two  Penny  Ale will be no contemptible Table Drink and no small ease to the Poor Trades People who will then find good Drink for  Pennies per  Pint whereas now none is under two  Pence  This appears plainer by the following Calcul  The Brewers clear Price supposed to be    Pennies  Add the Queens Excise on SmallBear    Pennies  Add for the Allowance to the Score and Gallon    Pennies  The Brewers Price to the Retailer will be    Pennies  And Allowing the Retailler Pennies per Pint    Pennies  FRom these two Views of the greater and lesser Excise It not only appears that the greater is no such hideous monster as is commonly believed but also that taking both Jointly we should be full as easy as now especially with regard to  the Poorer sort of People Nay further we should be much easier than we have been for several Years since the Revolution For from the st of  June  to the st of  May  our Excise was  Merks per  Boll and  Pennies per  Pint in all  Pennies per  Pint only half a  Penny  less than the  English  greater Excise And from st of  September  to  March    Pennies per  Pint from thence to  March    Pennies  and from thence to  March    Pennies  So that for a Tract of Years we were under an Excise near equal to the  English  in quantity but vastly more burdensome as will appear by the following two Considerations  That the Dear Years were part of these six which considering the circumstance of the Poor were hard enough under any Excise but this is only a temporary Consideration the next is perpetual  viz  That we neither had then nor have now any distinction betwixt Small and Strong Ale The consequence of which was that the Brewers finding all Ale equal as to Excise chose rather to Brew Strong Ale which would yield them six  Pennies  profite  per  Pint than small which yielded only two  Pennies  yet Payed the same Excise and accordingly the Ale commonly Sold then was  Pence per  Pint or  Pence  and a Plack which the poor People behooved either to Buy or Drink Water Whereas should the Brewers Brew strong Ale under the  English  Excise yet there will still be good wholsom Drink for the poorer sort at an easie Rate by reason of the distinction of the Excise  If what is here advanced be true as there is little reason to doubt since it depends on Uncontraverted matters of fact and a Plain and simple calcul It may seem odd that the Author of the  Short View of our present Trade and Taxes  Page Should suppose each Boll of Malt will produce  sh  sterl  Excise and should on this build his calcul of the Increase of Excise in case of the Union No doubt a Brewer for a Wager may produce near  sh  Excise from a Boll by Brewing Ale at  pennies per  Pint true value but he's a Mad Man if he does so for ordinary since had he Brewed  at  pennies  the Excise would only be near  sh    d sterl  and since we are supposing I shall suppose and make good that a Brewer may bring the Excise of a Boll of Malt to  sh  and  d Scots  by Brewing only Gallons of very strong Ale from it which at  sh    d Scots per  Gallon makes the fore+said Sum But the Brewer will be regula  by none of our suppositions he'll Brew such Ale as will best bear the respective Excises and at the same time please his
