the Irish settlers in North Britain little concerns the history of Scotland But as much has been writ∣ten on this subject and this work might be regarded as imperfect without some illustra∣tions upon it a few shall be propounded with as much brevity as possible  SECTION I  Irish Origins  At this moment when entering on a subject essential to ancient Irish history i feel myself as much a native of Ireland as of Britain Far from violating the reverence due to the antiqui∣ties  of that noble iland i should be happy to support and illustrate them as far as lay in my power But having treated the antiquities of my own country with all the freedom of an ardent en∣quirer after truth i must beg leave to assert the same philosophic privilege in respect to other realms  It may be imagined that i who confess no further knowledge of the Celtic language than is picked up from a few grammars and dictionaries am but ill qualified to discuss a subject whose evidences are wrapt up in that language But from complete and repeated perusal of most Irish and other writers who have treated this matter in Latin or English certainly all the information necessary on this point may now be had The works of Mageogaghan Stanihurst Colgan Usher Ware Keating Maccurtin Kennedy O'Flaherty O'Conor c c derived from all the monuments in the Irish language surely af∣ford full and sufficient materials and as complete knowlege of the original evidence as can be procured from that evidence itself I hope there∣fore to escape any charge of rashness while i exa∣mine this important part of Irish history upon the testimony of Irish writers Were i writing on the history of Ireland or Wales in a total igno∣rance of the Irish and Welch languages there would be room for as much laughter and utter derision as if one should attempt to paint without colours or to build without materials But as i am only occupied with the history of Scotland of which there is not one monument in the Celtic tongues  The Duan in the Appendix to this volume only concerns the Dalriads whose history is not that of Scotland any more than the history of Wales is that of England  it is hoped laborious perusal of the Irish writers in Latin or English will in this instance atone for my ignorance of the Celtic  It is well known that the history of Ireland has like that of Scotland had a singular fate While the history and antiquities of Scotland have been for five centuries a field of the blackest forgery falsification and perversion of all autho∣rities those of Ireland have afforded a scene as deplorable tho not so detestable of folly and credulity The contest between the Irish antiqua∣ries who were right and the Scotish who were wrong became unequal by the natural preponde∣rance of cunning over weakness The fables gross beyond those of childhood or anility and disgraceful to the very name of human reason which stained the page of Irish history now be∣gin slowly to vanish According to the present state of Antiquities in Ireland there remain only three additional fables to be thrown aside  That concerning the Firbolg  The Tuath de Danan  The Milesians  Those abandoned to utter oblivion precede these three in antiquity and are  The three daughters of Cain  Caesara Noah's niece  Partholanus  The race of Nemedius  Let us examine the three remaining fables yes at the end of the eighteenth century let us exa∣mine fables that would disgrace the twelfth not the dreams of sensible ignorance but of the mad∣ness of noonday    The Fir bolg  It is unnecessary to sicken the reader by any detail of these fables The Firbolg according to Irish antiquaries came to Ire∣land about years before Christ The Tuath de Danan about after The Milesians about years before our aera Simply to enquire how the memory of these events was preserved in an illiterate country is a sufficient confutation of those childish fables He who believes them is incapable of reason or conviction It would therefore be labour lost to confute absurdity for  the foolish cannot be convinced and those indued with the smallest portion of common sense would only have recourse to laughter  In this fable the name alone is just for it is now allowed that the FirBolg were the Belgae placed by Ptolemy the geographer in the South of Ire∣land But these Belgae as appears by the Disser∣tation annexed could not be there till about years before Christ so that the reality of the name as preserved in Irish tradition palliates not the fable which ought to be wholly set aside espe∣cially as it precedes the Milesians a race entirely and utterly fabulous It is indeed clear that those dreaming compilers who mention the Firbolg and Tuath de Danan have erred grossly in placing the Milesians after them None of those Irish fablers are older than the  Thirteenth  century and have altered the real series of the fables in order to make their favourite Milesians the last and conquerors of all the former Nennius who wrote in and used the Irish accounts then existing says nothing of the Firbolg nor Tuath de Danan but only tells of the Spanish or Milesian colo∣nies as the first inhabitants of Ireland  Nennius knew nothing of Milesius but only mentions  Miles quidam Hispanus  a certain Spanish  soldier  Of this  Miles  the Irish made Milesius as of Julius Caesar they made Caesara Noah's niece  So also Giraldus Cambrensis who wrote about The Psalter of Cashel which seems the very fountain of these visions is by some Irish antiqua∣ries said to have been written by Cormac king of Ireland about the year Others ascribe it to a Cormac king and bishop of Cashel about the year Mageogaghan who details a long account of the matter gives it to king Brian Borowe's time about the year I have redd many quota∣tions and extracts from it and it seems a collec∣tion of poetical romances on Irish history compiled  in the Thirteenth century at the earliest and kept and found at Cashel whence the name    The Tuath de Danan  That a great part of the Damnii fled from North Britain into Ireland before the Pikish pressure has already been shewn to be highly probable But this event could not happen above years before our aera whereas these Tuath de Danan are placed about years before Christ The name as with the Firbolg seems genuine and traditional but the Irish ac∣count of this colony of magicians for such they are represented is ridiculously false All the Irish accounts agree that the Tuath de Danan went from North Britain to Ireland but represent them as before that residing in Denmark and practising magic  An ingenious Irish author who is writing an history of Ireland and whose judgment despises what even fancy cannot believe is inclined to think that the Tuath de Danan were the Danes Certain it is that Danan was and is the Irish for a Dane But it is also certain that the name of Dane was unknown till the Sixth century when Jornan∣des and Procopius first mention it  Jornandes wrote about Procopius about Gre∣gory of Tours who wrote about mentions the Danes under the year 'Dani cum rege suo Chlochilaicho' as ravaging Gaul  The Danish writers allow it not to have been the ancient name but to have proceeded from a king called Dan or from  Daun  our  down  'Low country' as Den∣mark is to Scandinavia And from a complete series of writers and geographers in particular it is perfectly known that the name was not existent till the Sixth century Like the name of Saxons Franks Alamans Slavons it seems to have arisen at a late period from some adventitious circum∣stance That no Scandinavians nor Danes pro∣ceeded to Ireland till the end of the eighth century shall be presently argued Had the Tuath de  Danan been Danes how came they to be totally unmentioned in the Annals of Ulster or more an∣cient writers till the Eighth century To them who know the nature of tradition and of Celtic tradition in particular it will not indeed be sur∣prizing that ignorant bards of the Twelfth and Thirteenth centuries should confound all chrono∣logy so far as to make the Danes who arrived in Ireland in the Eighth century settle there more than a thousand years before Christ In this view but in no other the Tuath de Danan may be the Danes But as the Milesian frenzies follow these Tuath de Danan there is no reason to discrimi∣nate them or the Firbolg from the mass of fable merely because the names may be real and traditional while that of Milesians confessedly is not If the Irish antiquaries as they have from the beginning daily changed their ground will change it once more and put the Milesians first and the Firbolg and Tuath de Danan after some plausible discussion might follow But as the case stands the Firbolg Tuath de Danan and Mile∣sians form one lump of fiction    The Milesians  This fabulous progeny ac∣cording to Irish accounts after many adventures in Europe Asia and Africa arrived in Spain and from thence came to Ireland about years before Christ There subduing the Tuath de Danan they founded a great and powerful kingdom flourishing in literature arts and arms but by a singular fate unknown and invisible to other nations The kings and leading people of Ireland were all in the diseased imagination of later bards and antiquists descended from the Milesian stock and hence of course the chief fables of Irish antiquity rest upon it The Firbolg and Tuath de Danan are regarded as foreigners and the Milesians as the ancestors of the Irish nation  As this Milesian Tale is the grand object of religi∣ous faith and reverent research among the Irish an∣tiquaries  and of eternal laughter and utter scorn among those of all other countries it is hoped that a short acount of it will not be unacceptable There are two  systems  of this deplorable piece of absurdity that of the  Irish  authors and that of the  Scotish  The later as Father Innes shews at great length is by far the more rational of the two and is also the most pure and ancient being in consonance with Nennius and other early wri∣ters while the Irish is perverted and corrupt and more foolish than folly  The  Irish  story is briefly this Fenius Farsa was great grandson to Japhet one of Noah's sons Farsa's son Niul came from Scythia to Greece Niul's son GATHELUS went to Egypt and thence to Spain where he founded a kingdom which there lasted for thirteen generations before MILE∣SIUS This Milesius went to Scythia where he served under king Resloir thence to Egypt where he married SCOTA the daughter of Pharaoh and carried her to Spain HEREMON eldest son of Milesius led the Milesians to Ireland and founded his kingdom there about years before Christ From him the catalogue of Irish kings is drawn in constant succession HIBER the brother of Here∣mon also attended him and had the North of Ire∣land  The  Scotish  account as given by Fordun Win∣ton Boyce c runs thus Niul the twentieth from Japhet went from Scythia to Greece GA∣THELUS Niul's son went to Egypt where he married SCOTA the daughter of Pharaoh and after the Egyptians were drowned in the Red Sea he proceeded to Spain and founded a kingdom EBER the son of Gathelus discovered Ireland and called it Scotia in honour of his mother and it was also called Hibernia from the discoverer But he founded no kingdom there returning immediately to Spain MILESIUS whom the blundering transcribers of Fordun call  Micelius  Winton  Milet  was the thirteenth from Gathelus and reigned in Spain Heremon Partholm and Hybert sons of Milesius led a colony to Spain and the two last remained there but assumed no kingly title Heremon returned to Spain where he succeeded his father Winton makes no men∣tion of any colony being led by the sons of Milesius but puts him barely in the list of the successors of Gathelus The seventeenth in a right line from Mi∣lesius was the famous SIMON BREC who by the Scotish tale brought the noted stone from Spain to Ireland and founded the monarchy there Winton says that Fergus son of Erc who brought the stone to Scotland and founded the Scotish monarchy was in the Fiftieth and Fifth degree of descendance from Simon Brec With this illustri∣ous founder of the Irish monarchy according to the Scotish account  Old Sir Simon the King  the later Irish antiquaries are so angry that to prevent the Scotish tale from prejudicing Heremon they have some of them hanged Simon Brec and others have torn him in pieces for some pretended crime of which they cannot at this day produce any evi∣dence As a Scotishman i must loudly in the name of my country protest against this gross in∣justice of hanging a man without hearing his de∣fence and wonder that Mr Goodal or some such zealous Scotish author has not written "A Defence of Simon Brec alias Old Sir Simon the King against the bloody atrocious and crying slaughter committed on him after he was dead by certain Irish antiquaries with some reflections from the book called God's revenge against mur∣der"  But to be serious if possible The Scotish ac∣count is more coherent and plausible than the Irish as Father Innes shews at great length To add to the absurdity of the later Donald O'Neal king of Ulster in his letter to Pope John XXII in the year informs the Pontif that it was  then about years since the three sons of Mile∣sius settled in Spain that is they were there about years before Christ's birth But the grand and radical difference between the Irish and Scotish account  is that the former commences the Mile∣sian monarchy with HERE  ON the eldest son of Milesius and as stated by O'Flaherty about years before Christ whereas the Scotish relation begins that monarchy in the person of SIMON BREC the sixteenth in degree from Heremon and yet about years before Christ By the old genea∣logy there are fiftyeight generations from Simon Brec down to Fergus son of Erc tho Winton makes but fiftyfive Of these generations there are twentyfour from Simon to Forgo the mock Fergus I of Scotish dreamers and thirtyfour from Forgo to Fergus son of Erc Allowing years as usual to each generation fiftyeight generations extend to years Twentyfour generations make years from Simon to Forgo and thirtyfour make from Forgo to Fergus son of Erc Fergus son of Erc ascended the Scotish throne about years after Christ and of course by the Scotish account Simon Brec lived about years before Christ and Forgo about instead of as Fordun Boyce Bucha∣nan date him merely to make him cotemporary with Alexander the Great  Such are the two Milesian systems that of the Scotish and that of the Irish writers Since the Sixteenth century the Scotish authors have totally dropt it on their part or mentioned it merely as a weak fable But the Irish writers persist in it to this hour and regard those who despise it as ene∣mies of their nation and invidious of it's honour Deluded madmen they are themselves the worst enemies of their country and the real and unmer∣ciful destroyers of it's honour of it's character among all nations For from the writers of any country a judgment is often rashly formed con∣cerning  the knowlege and wisdom of the country at large In the present case no error can be greater as out of two millions in Ireland not a thousand have even heard of those lamentable delusions and of that thousand nine hundred utterly despise them True it is that the crazy and mercenary bards and sennachies thought to get money and favour by giving genealogies of their patrons carried up to Heremon and Milesius nay to Adam and far beyond And the Irish antiquists as O'Connor the translator of Keating and others the true heirs of the madness of the sennachies and in fact mere modern sennachies attempt to continue the imposture by tracing all the chief families of Ireland up to Milesius in order by this pitiful trick to engage them all under the banners of folly But these families having solid claims of respect do generally contemn these poor delusions and are content as other noble families of Europe to close the genealogy at the first shade of uncertainty for falsehood far from adding honour is infa∣mous in itself and can only bring infamy and de∣rision Men of reading are in their closets apt to dream of opinions being national which are in fact confined to a few visionaries Antiquarian matters are as i humbly conceive never national as there are seldom above a dozen antiquaries in a nation and in the British empire where alone antiquary and visionary are synonymous the nation only laughs at it's antiquaries On the continent indeed where an antiquary is a sacred and most important cha∣racter that of a man of profound and solid learning who confers honour on his country by a most labo∣rious research into it's genuine antiquities and intro∣ducing them to the most rigorous discussion of the whole republic of letters the highest respect is paid to antiquaries and their province is justly regarded as by far the most difficult and of course the most honourable in the whole circle of science But even there antiquarian matters are not na∣tional  but only known to the thinking and learned few It is therefore merely the vanity of authors that dreams of nations being interested in support of their opinions while not above one in ten thousand of the nation has ever heard any thing of the matter With these views tho i have the most sincere respect for the Irish nation yet i scruple not to hold to due contempt the Irish sennachies and modern antiquists which last would be called children and not antiquaries on the continent and believe that every sensible native of Ireland will see that to expose the ab∣surd enemies of the true honour of that country is to do a service to its cause For if i am rightly informed in Ireland as here and in the rest of Europe the very name of Milesians is a jest and the acceptance of any part of the fable is esteemed an infallible criterion of an insane writer Indeed as there is no credit due to any account of Irish kings or their actions preceding the Christian aera the very mark A M or  Anno Mundi  in Irish affairs is well interpreted  Asinaria Maxima  by fo∣reigners and affords perpetual laughter  These fables shall be dismissed with a remark or two naturally arising from the subject The whole tale of the Milesians and the history of the monarchs of that mock line preceding our aera or for a thousand years is the most deplorable piece of nonsense that ever stained the annals of mankind The fables of the other Grand Celtic race the Welch as delivered to us by the de∣servedly infamous Geoffrey of Monmouth and de∣duced from Brutus great grand son of Eneas who as they tell came to Britain about years before Christ are sober and sapient com∣pared to the Irish fictions In the page of Geof∣frey of Monmouth may be found an Imogen a Locrine and Guendolen with their daughter Sabra a Bladud a Lear and his daughters a Gordobuc a Belinus a Lud an Arthur all  nonexistences yet well known in the regions of poetry and romance But the whole Irish historic fictions are not only beneath contempt as history but beneath contempt as fictions To read them is to be condemned to a disgust and pity the same with that arising from the conversation of a mere idiot Zealous as i am for what little truth can be found in history were i a native of Ireland and could evidence the veracity of these tales to all Europe by irrefragable proofs i would give my vote for their being left in utter oblivion lest they should dishonour my country Destitute of the smallest charm of fiction they are not only lies but disgusting and nauseous lies Boyce Bucha∣nan and the other Scotish forgers made their fic∣tions lessons to monarchs and it is to their false∣hoods that we owe the death of Charles I and ab∣dication of James II  See Nicolson's Scotish Hist Lib p Sir James Tur∣ner a colonel of Charles I declared that Buchanan's books had alone raised the nation against the King They were uni∣versally redd and the English argued that if the Scots had power over their kings they had the same  The tales of the Welch and Scotish forgers had an influence on the whole his∣tory of Europe those of the Irish never had nor can have any effect being wholly contemptible even to imagination Bishop Nicolson in his Irish historical library has most facetiously at∣tempted to bring the Irish fables into a similar point of view with the Islandic On the very plan he has followed a comparison might also be drawn of the Hottentot traditions with the Gothic and he seems totally to have forgot that the power of the human mind is no where better distinguished than in fiction it's own creation The Gothic tales are often ingenious always vigorous some∣times sublime Even the wildest of them has al∣ways strong marks of  of thought of sense The mythology and wellknown unconquerable character of the people live and breath in them  all The Irish legends are in all points the re∣verse The Milesian fable is connected with Pha∣raoh and bears other palpable marks of being in∣vented long after Christianity was established in Ireland Odin was the god of war and can be traced in most writers of the middle ages long before the Icelandic monuments were written Snorro who wrote in the thirteenth century places the arrival of Odin in Scandinavia about seventy years before Christ  Edda apud Torf Ser Reg Dan Mallet has adopted this puerile opinion  Donald O'Neal in the fourteenth placed the arrival of the sons of Mile∣sius who were never heard of before about years before Christ Beda who wrote in mentions Odin but tho intimate with many of the most learned men of Ireland had never heard a syllable of the Milesian tales but puts Ireland as the  patria  or first habitation of the Scots Let any one read the Northern sagas and he will find manly judgment and fine imagination while the Irish tales are quite destitute of these quali∣ties The Scandinavians we know had letters and yet their antiquaries build not on this the Irish we know had none till converted by Patrick and yet their writers are forced as one absurdity includes another to build their fairy mansion upon the use of letters among a people marked by the Greek and Roman writers as utterly savage Bi∣ship Nicolson's parallel only shews the infallibility of the axiom that fancy will find resemblances any where while to discriminate is the peculiar pro∣vince of judgment Others have said that there are fables in early Greek and Roman history and why not allow the Irish to pass as such With all my heart but observe at the same time that the Greek and Roman fables vary a little from the Irish the former being produced by great and able writers and deservedly admired for many  centuries the later the weak effusions of silly sen∣nachies and only fit for the flames The argu∣ment is modest and Celtic but there is as is generally believed a difference in fable some slight shade of dissonance between the history of Tom Jones and that of Tom Thumb There are also degrees in nonsense some nonsense is risible other nonsense as the old Irish history is supersuperlative and extrasoporific As history or as fiction it is equally absurd Allegory is the last apology for nonsense  Late writers have attempted to compare Irish names and history with those of Egypt Armenia Otaheite c but not to speak of their gross misquotations and misrepresenta∣tions the same frantic fancy might find resemblance in any objects whatever In the mental as in the natural night all objects are confounded To shew the Chinese history the same with the Dutch in names and events would only require one quality in any writer a disordered imagination  but even John Bunyan could not allegorize Milesian history Late Irish writers say that Fenius Farsa was a name for the Phenicians Simon Brec for Sampson who broke the heads of the Philistines c There is one in∣famy yet greater than telling a lye and that is to make an apology for that lye The more plausible the apology is it is the more scandalous So much the better so much the worse For to im∣pose on society is one crime but to colour that imposition afresh and to dress falsehood in the holy robes of truth is a far greater crime No modi∣fication or apology of any kind can be accepted The point is utterly to give up these abominable fables and till this be done the Irish antiquaries will have them all to themselves without one rival For how can the literati of Europe converse with those who give evident signs of madness of a mad∣ness unknown to any other nation  Before proceeding to consider the real and genuine origins of Irish history it becomes neces∣sary to notice the claim which some Irish anti∣quaries pretend their country has to the use of letters  before Christianity was planted there Keating tells that Fenius Farsa great grandson of Ja∣phet and ancestor of the Milesians set up a school of learning in the plains of Senaar about one hundred and fifty years after the deluge and invented Hebrew Greek Latin and Irish characters These earliest Irish characters were the  Bethluisnion  and  Ogum  according to Toland who gravely relates this childish lye as matter of fact Charles the Second said of Isaac Vossius that he believed every thing but the scripture and this character is justly applicable to Toland whose incredulity must have been the fruit of vain glory and not of strength of mind For there is nothing in scripture so absurd as this and he who believed this should have boggled at nothing The mind of Toland must like that of Isaac Vos∣sius have been very ill poised and instead of calling such men philosophers it can only be said that they were fools who believed or disbelieved as the whim led them For sound reason knows no prejudices but weighs every thing in the same scales The Irish history also bears that king Tigermna and after him Eocha Ollamfodla about years before Christ gave great en∣couragement to learning ordered annals to be di∣gested c By such gross falsehoods asserted at random would these Irish antiquists persuade the literati of Europe to believe impossibilities Who can confute such nonsense and who will listen to the confutation  The old characters which the Irish pretend to are the  Bethluisnion  the different kinds of  Ogum Bebeloth  c The Bethluisnion is the common Saxon or lower Roman alphabet changed in the order of letters by the whim of the sennachies The different kinds of Ogum are merely sorts of shorthandwriting used in the middle ages The Bebeloth is another contracted mode of writing well known to the learned by the name of  Notae Longobardicoe  The Helsing Runes  consisting of conic marks variously disposed have also i believe been found in Ireland so long possessed in part by the Danes and have as usual been regarded as letters older than christianity while they were used in Denmark in the Twelfth century It is in vain to strive not only with folly but with utter ignorance If those Irish antiquists will study the antiquities of Europe and compare them with their own they may acquire sobriety As it is when an Usher or a Ware arises in Ireland they regard those matters as mere dreams and pass at once to the time when chris∣tianity and letters first appeared in Ireland The cause of folly is only supported by ignorance and no writer cares to answer what all know to be puerile The contest between those Irish writers and the literati of all Europe is the most risible in the world The former say their country was highly civilized had letters and academies as the Greeks and Romans The latter say the Greeks we know and the Romans we know but who are ye Those Greeks and Romans pronounce you not only barbarous but utterly savage Where are your authorities against this In the name of that degree of rationality which even some beasts have where are the slightest marks of ancient civi∣lization among you Where are ruins of cities Where inscriptions Where ancient coins Where is the least trace of ancient art or science in your whole iland The old inhabitants of your country the Wild Irish the true Milesian breed untainted with Gothic blood we know to be utter savages at this day Can a nation once civilized ever become savage Impossible Such a nation may be lost in effeminacy as the modern Italians and Greeks but will ever bear marks of the ex∣cess not the want of civilization  Father Innes has at great length examined and completely confuted the Irish claim to letters be∣fore St Patrick introduced them along with chris∣tianity  about the year That the Irish had letters so early and many writers soon after is surely enough and more than several great na∣tions of Europe can pretend to The Germans Scandinavians Polanders Russians have by no means such early claim but stand later by near four centuries In the name of heaven what would those Celtic gentry have But like the dog in the fable by grasping at the shadow they lose the substance and the fictions of early Irish his∣tory bring contempt upon the whole From such friends and assertors may heaven defend my country We are told of many abstract terms in the old Irish language as a proof that the people were civilized Yet no such terms are produced and if they were how old are they The use of Latin abstract terms is quite modern In the old German Anglobelgic c the abstract terms are peculiar to the speech as  godhede  for  deity  c There is not one Irish manuscript extant older than the Eleventh century long after metaphysics and other nonsensical learning had been success∣fully studied there What wonder then at abstract terms The Irish antiquists as i have found from experience are so ignorant as not to know a MS of the Fourteenth century but will repeatedly call such a one of the Third Fourth or Fifth as they please to baptise it They do not know what is known to all yet pretend to know what is un∣known to all Vague references to MSS of vague antiquity form the main chicane of Irish authors who are so stupid as not to discern that this is never allowed in such questions but that if a MS be quoted it's age place where kept page and column are always accurately marked by the antiquaries of all other countries and the words themselves always produced with a literal transla∣tion But the Irish MSS are ashamed of the light and it is no wonder that they shun it Of Ice∣landic MSS we have above Five Hundred now in  print Of Irish not one The consequence is that the language cannot be studied and is but imperfectly known even to those Irish writers who use these MSS as is clear from the various and vague interpretation given by different Irish writers of one and the same passage They are perpetually accusing each other of not understand∣ing the tongue and i do believe they are all in the right Were the MSS published the language would be studied by different literati and it's principles and vocabulary fully settled At present who will study a language in which there is not one book published  Having thus with as much patience as possible mentioned the fabulous origins of Ireland it re∣mains to illustrate the truth of this subject As there is not one Irish manuscript at all mentioning these origins which is older than the Thirteenth century it is clear that no information can be ex∣pected from Irish MSS upon this matter and that far from throwing the least ray of light upon it they only darken it with the thickest clouds of ig∣norance and folly In judging of Irish origins therefor as in those of other European nations recourse must be had to the only genuine fountains of light the Roman writers  It is universally known that the Wild Irish re∣mains of the old inhabitants call themselves Gael and their language Gaelic and that they are Celts from Gaul Much labour has been wasted in at∣tempting to shew that they must have past from Britain the nearest shore To me it is apparent that they actually passed from the Northwest of Gaul to Ireland tho great numbers might join them from Britain The manner in which pro∣found scholars treat human affairs is often highly risible They judge of them upon mechanical principles A sensible French writer has ruined a learned dissertation by supposing that barbaric nations have no navigation but always proceed  by land Tacitus more wisely thought there could be no progress but by sea But both were wrong for want of one simple reflection namely that even savages have generally hands as well as feet No savages have yet been discovered over the whole globe who had no navigation From the North Pole to the South Pole where there were men there were canoes The invention if it may be so called is so utterly simple that every untaught infant throws his cork upon the water and if he had a cork large enough would jump on it to have a sail himself If we except eating and drinking there is certainly no art so primitive as rude navigation Where cloths are not invented where huts are not invented still there are canoes And from the late discoveries in the South Sea we know that even the rudest savages will venture on a voyage at open sea of four or five hundred miles or more Let us therefore judge of human affairs not by mechanical learning but by com∣mon sense and allow for instance that it is quite uncertain whether Ireland or Britain was first peopled from Gaul The passage over the straits of Dover is Twentyfour miles that from the Northwest of Gaul to Ireland is about Two Hun∣dred The probability is certainly that Britain was first peopled but it by no means follows that Ireland must have been peopled from Britain For the vast forests of Britain and three hundred miles of breadth were far more difficult to pass than two hundred miles of open sea which a fleet of savages in canoes might pass on a summer day The sea as now perfectly known far from separating nations is the grand mean of comm  ∣nication between them It is land and not sea that is difficult for civilized nations as for savages to pass  That the old Irish did not originate from Spain can never be argued from the distance which is but four hundred miles of open sea but from  other urgent reasons I once inclined to think that they did originate from Spain chiefly be∣cause Tacitus thought the Silures who were in that part of Britain opposite to Ireland a Spanish colony and because he mentions that the ports of Ireland were in his time more frequented than those of Britain Other reasons also concurred For it might reasonably be supposed that as the Celts held Germany and Gaul so they also pos∣sessed Spain before the Iberi came over from Africa and expelled them That the Irish were not Iberi is certain from their speech which is Celtic not Iberian or Cantabric If they came from Spain they must therefore have been Celts from Spain And it was highly plausible to sup∣pose that the Iberi drove the Celts out of Spain on the East over the Pyrenees but that on the west the Celts were confined between the Iberi and the sea and had no recourse but to escape by sea and that as all the coast of Gaul and Britain was filled with their Celtic brethren they would naturally pass to the nearest uninhabited land which was Ireland Facts also seemed to corrobo∣rate this theory We find may Celtic nations in the North of Spain as described by ancient writers The Verones a people of present Biscay were Celts as Strabo tells  lib  III p In Asturia there were also Celts as Pliny informs us  lib  III  cap  But above all and what was most to the purpose in Gallicia that very point of Spain which fronts Ireland and to which it was natural to suppose that the Celts would be driven the an∣cients actually place Celts Cape Finisterre was called  Promontorium Gelticum  not Ibericum by the ancients and Pliny describing the nations around it or in Gallicia puts  Celtici cognomine Nerioe  and  Celtici cognomine Proesamarci  lib IV c Strabo also  lib  III p tells that the region around this promontory was inhabited by Celts And there is every reason to believe  that the Gallaeci who are here placed by Pliny and other ancients and who gave name to present Gallicia were Gauls and bore the Gallic name accordingly In this scheme of Irish origins i much exulted as it would give me no small pleasure to support the Irish antiquaries in their favorite Spanish origin  But unhappily all this theory was forced to yield to ancient facts In the dissertation annexed it is shewn that the Celrici and Celtiberi of Spain were not Celts proper but German Gauls who as new possessors of Gaul the ancient domain of the Celts acquired the name of Celts as the English in Britain are termed Britons in America Americans Yet the Celtiberi were on the East and the Celtici on the South of Spain so that these northern Celts of Spain might have been re∣mains of the old Celts But the authority of Strabo is direct on the other side and admits of no answer or palliative For he shews that both the Verones and the Celts of Gallicia were of the same race with the Celtici and Celtiberi that is German Gauls and that far from being old possessors of the country they had only gained their territories in the same late expedition with the Celtiberi and Celtici Of the Verones he says  lib  III p  'Inhabit to the parts north of the Celtiberi the VERONES neigh∣bours of the Cantabrian Conisci and they also were of the Celtic expedition' And  lib  III p speaking of the Promontorium Celticum which was also called Nerium he says  'Furthest dwell the Artabri at the promontory which is called Nerion and which is the bound of the northern and of the western side of Spain  The Celtici inhabit around it of the same race with those on the river Ana' Those on the Ana were the Celtici peculiarly so called and who are shewn to have been Gothic or German Gauls in the annexed Dissertation Whether they were Celts or Goths is indeed nothing to the purpose for it is clear that these northern Celts of Spain were all of one expedition with the Celtici and Celtiberi who had lately past from Gaul into Spain as appears from Lucan Silius Italicus Diodorus Siculus Strabo Appian So that they were not ancient inhabitants of the country but late immigrators from Gaul who had conquered possessions for themselves from the Iberi What time this expedition happened is uncertain but from the strong memory of it in all the above authors it was certainly late and the learned and accurate Schoepflin  Vindiciae Celticae  only says that it must have hap∣pened before the Second Punic War as Livy XXII and Silius Italicus III mention the Celtiberi as engaged in that war which broke out years before Christ It is shewn in the Dissertation that the Celts proper or old savages of Gaul were so far from sending colonies into other countries that they could not defend their own and in particular the Iberi gained all Aqui∣tania from them so that their conquering Iberian possessions would have been a phaenomenon indeed That the Gauls or Celts so called of Gallia Bracata were Gothic or German Gauls and that as they lay on the North of Spain while the other Gauls were at a distance there is no room to doubt that they were the Celts so called who seized various possessions in Spain This further appears from the names of their towns in Spain of which many begin or end with  brig  the German  berg  or  town  so usual at this day Strabo lib VII and Steph de Urb say that  bria  or  briga  signifies  a town  It was a Thracian term Nicol Damascen Hist in Valesii Exc p  This it does in no Celtic dialect but in the Gothic it retains that meaning Among the Celts of the North of Spain we find  Flaviobriga  now Bilboa or Flaviusberg and  Flavium Bri∣gantium  Ferrol But not to rest the argument even upon this truth it cannot at any rate be ever imagined that the few Celts who migrated from Gaul into the north of Spain at a late period could be those Celts who peopled Ireland Ware and other cool Irish antiquaries who argue that the Irish came from Spain always conclude them Iberi the real ancient inhabitants of Spain and that the name Ibernia sprung from the Iberi But this opinion is wholly untenable because the Irish language the Gaelic is as remote from the Ibe∣rian or Cantabric as possible and is well known to be a grand Celtic dialect The ancients are totally silent concerning any Celtic aborigines in Spain and uniformly regard the Iberi as the most ancient inhabitants so that it is certain that the old Irish as Celts proper could not pass from Spain a country never inhabited by Celts proper but must have passed from Gaul a nearer country and known to have been originally wholly possest by Celts proper  So much for the origin of the Wild Irish or true Gaelic Irish esteemed by their antiquaries the genuine Milesian breed The prevalence of their language is a clear proof that they were al∣ways by far the most numerous people in Ireland as they formed the real ancient population of the country and such colonies as settled among them were regarded as aliens The date of this earliest population of Ireland it is impossible to ascertain and it may have been a thousand or two thousand years before our aera It is indeed a matter of supreme indifference at what time the savages of a continent peopled a neighbouring iland  But tho it be thus certain that the Gaelic Irish the Irish peculiarly so called or Wild Irish were Gael or Celts of Gaul it remains to enquire if any Iberian colonies settled among them For tho the prevalence of the Gaelic tongue shews that the Celts formed the grand population of the country yet Iberian colonies might arrive and their own speech be lost as usual in that of the more numer∣ous inhabitants The whole idea of the popula∣tion of Ireland from Spain seems to have arisen from the proximity of the names  Iberni  and  Iberi  and the absurd etymologies of Isidorus and other writers of the middle ages surely led the way to all the dreaming connection between Ibernia and Iberia between Ireland and Spain To those who know how often great events spring from little causes it will not appear wonderful that the prox∣imity of the words  Ibernia  and  Iberia  has converted the ancient history of Ireland into a mass of folly never mentioned but with laughter What foolish ideas did not the Iberi of Asia and those of Spain lead even sensible ancients into Strabo and others thought the former sprung from the later Pliny and others on the contrary thought that the Iberi of Spain proceeded from those in Asia Etymology and approximation of names one would imagine were two rocks of Syrens in the ocean of literature that deprived even sensible writers of common understanding For is any matter so sim∣ple so universally known as that identic names will happen from mere falls of letters and from the greatest variety of causes Did Pendennis in Asia Minor bear the same origin as Pendennis in Corn∣wall Cannot a hundred instances be given of identic names in languages that have no relation And in the same languages is not the same word often used in various meanings and the same name given to nations of quite distinct origins because it implies some common quality I assent to Pelloutier that the name  Iberi  is from the  Gothic  Uber  beyond but think that the Goths of Asia gave it to their own brethren  Beyond  the mountains that run between them and the Iberi of Asia and those of Gallia Bracata also gave the very same name to quite a different people  Beyond  the Pyrenees We term the Scotish high∣landers Mountaineers and the Swiss Moun∣taineers and if in the simplicity of ancient times Mountaineers had become a national term it might have been argued that the Swiss and Highlanders were of one name and origin No writer of the smallest pretension to common rationality ever ought to found any thing on etymology or identity of distant names and too strong detestation can∣not be exprest against this childish frenzy which has tainted and utterly spoilt innumerable works of this century and corrupted them into mas∣ses of learned madness the disgrace mortifica∣tion and contempt of human reason  The Roman names of Ireland  Hibernia Iverne Ierne  are now thought to have sprung from the Cumraig or old British  Yverdon  or Western Ile tho perhaps from the Gothic  UberEy  or  IberEy  'the further iland' in respect to Britain The indigenal name  Erin  has the same meaning but the Romans received the name from the Britons The old etymology of  Iberni  from  Iberi  is accord∣ingly now abandoned on all hands But it deserves notice that there was a tribe called peculiarly  Iverni  in the south of Ireland as appears from the Palatine MS which contains the genuine text of Ptolemy far more free from corruptions than any other The common editions bear  Uterni  but that  Iverni  is the genuine reading is clear from the Palatine MS and from Richard of Ciren∣cester It may therefore be argued that as the Gallic and other merchants would naturally touch at the South of Ireland and enquire the name of the first people they traded with the name of this  tribe might come to be given to the iland This derivation is indeed as probable as any other and in a matter so uncertain every one may follow his own mind Of what extract these Iverni were it is difficult to say Their town was  Ivernis  or as we would say  Inverness  upon the river  Iernus  now Kenmare To the East of them were the  Vodii  to the Northwest the  Luceni  and  Velabri Iver  or  Inver  is not unfrequent in Scandinavian and German names of places but as no such people as  Iverni  can be found in Britain Gaul or Spain it is impossible to determine the origin of the Iverni To the  Luceni  and  Velabri  on the West of them similar names are found on the North of Spain the  Luceni  or  Lucenses  of  Lucus  now Lugo in Gallicia Plin III and the  Velienses  of Biscay  ib  The  Auteri  of Ireland approxi∣mate to the  Autrigones  of Biscay  ib  The  Gangani  of Ireland Camden and Ware derive from the  Concani  in Spain  The reader will in vain look into geographers for Con∣cani in Spain or any where else Camden's authorities are  Et qui Massagetam monstrans feritate parentem  Cornupedis fera satiaris Concane vena  Sil Ital  and Horace  Et laetum equino sanguine Concanum  The first authority shews them Goths as were the other emi∣grators from Gaul into Spain  There were also  Caucenses  in present Leon of Spain as there were  Cau  i  in Ire∣land but the  Caucenses  were but the inhabitants of  Cauca  a small inland town so that they are as much out of the question as the  Caucones  of Pon∣tus Ptolemy mentions seven towns in Ireland two  Rhegias Rhaiba Laberus Macolicum Du∣num Ivernis  Of all which names i can find no trace in ancient Spain He also gives fifteen rivers  Logia Argita Vidua Ravius Libnius Ausoba Senus Dur Iernus Daurona Bargus Mo∣donus  Oboca Buvinda Vindarius  and three iles  Odrus Limnus  and  Ricina  Of these names i only find a river  Durus  in Spain and there was also a  Durius  in Devonshire and  Durius  in Italy as there was a  Deva  or Dee in Asturia There was a river  Bargus  that fell into the Hebrus Pliny IV Of all the names therefore given us by Ptolemy the  Luceni Velabri  and  Auteri  alone approximate to the Spanish names  Lucenses Ve∣lienses  and  Autrigones  But there were also  Leuci  and  Leuaci Velocassi  and  Atrebates  names as similar in Belgic Gaul  Autricum  was a city of the Carnuntes  Velavia  or  De Veluwe  is the ancient name of a large part of Guelderland And the pro∣bability is much in favour of the Belgic names for three reasons  That we find the Menapii and Cauci two nations of the Belgic coast in Ire∣land so that it is certain that some Belgic nations went there and probable that others followed whereas there is no Iberian nation to be positively traced in Ireland  That the Belgic coast is as near to Ireland as the Spanish and the passage is moreover a mere coasting voyage always in view of land  That we know from Caesar and other an∣cients that the Belgae peopled great part of Britain so that it is also probable that some went to Ireland the next shore whereas we find no trace of Iberi in Britain Tacitus who hints an opinion that the Silures were Iberi in the same sentence retracting that opinion And the Belgic nations of Britain are marked by Ptolemy and others while not one trace of a single Iberian nation can be found no  Cantabri Astures  c  Nor can any Cantabric or Iberian words be found in the Irish language while it abounds with Gothic terms For the spe∣cimen of Lloyd only shews the dissimilarity of the very words he chuses and he might have easily found more English words or German words with greater resemblance of the Cantabric than  the Irish if his whims had turned that way  Lloyd has in his total ignorance of the Gothic mistaken plain Gothic words for Irish and Cantabric See Lloyd's list compared with the German by Eccard in his  Origines Germanicae  The Japanese as has lately been shewn bears more resemblance to the Irish than the Cantabric does and if one seeks resemblance of single words in this way one is sure to find them for it would be a miracle indeed if out of words all pro∣duced by the same organs there were not alike in any two languages whatever  Thus the Tartaric Chinese Japanese Phoenician Asiatic c c have been paralleled with the Irish The Dutch with the Malayan Hebrew c The Welch with the Huron The English with the Peruvian The Greek with the Chinese And the reason of similar words in all languages is certainly very profound to wit that all mankind have the same passions and organs of speech When in the Dissertation annexed Language is put as a grand proof of the origin of nations it is meant not that words may be the same but that words or more are the same and that the idioms or soul and grammar or body of the language are the same A hundred comparisons of languages would be spared if a complete comparison of all languages were pub∣lished shewing in particular the difference between accidental resemblances and those shades which we call dialects as the English is of the German the German of the Gothic the Curlandic of the Polish the Polish of the Slavonic c But it requires great learning and experience even to conceive those radical differences tho vast which discriminate Grand Languages from each other as the Gothic from the Slavonic and the Tartaric and to distinguish those differences from those of mere dialect As to paralleling a few similar words from languages radically different the most ignorant may do it by means of dictionaries and it is remarkable that the most ignorant writers are the most apt to fall into this  It will therefore upon the whole not be accounted rash to say that there is not the slightest proof to be found that any colonies ever came from Spain to Ireland but that as such events always leave traces behind them and none such are to be found in ancient writers nor in the language of the peo∣ple there is firm reason to infer the contrary  On the continent an antiquary is a man who examines ancient matters upon ancient authorities  and solid reasoning In Britain an antiquary is a visionary who details superficial dreams to the public upon no ancient authority at all and upon the most silly and irrational ratiocination Hence what no foreign antiquary what no man of sound learning would even imagine has been seriously advanced among us lately to wit that the Phoe∣nicians settled colonies in the south of Britain and in Ireland That traces of the Phoenician lan∣guage may be found in that of the Wild Irish Seriously this is too bad this is pushing learned folly to an extreme degree Do reflect sweet gentleman dablers that the Phoenicians were a people equal to the Greeks and Romans in every art and refinement That the traces of their colonies in Africa in Spain are fixt and deci∣sive and throw light all around them That if they had held even the smallest settlement in Bri∣tain or Ireland so striking a circumstance so dis∣tinguished a mark of their extended power and na∣vigation could never have escaped  all  the ancient writers It is well known that the Phoenicians traded to Britain and Ireland from their Spanish colonies perhaps a thousand years before our aera Strabo tells us they imported to Britain earthen vessels salt iron and copper goods and exported skins but above all tin and Diodorus Siculus informs us that it was the people of Cape Belerium Cornwall that digged the tin From Ireland they could only export skins certainly a branch of commerce that no nation ever thought of settling for when the supply depended on the hunting c of all the inhabitants of the country Had the Phoenicians settled in any part of Britain or Ireland their usual splendor would have attended them A few Phoenician coins may perhaps be found in Britain and Ireland a circumstance na∣turally to be expected from their trading there but had there been any settlements there would have been ruins and numerous coins struck at the  settlement as at all those in Spain But not to waste time in answering the dreams of folly the total silence of all the ancients on this head is a complete negation The proximity of the Gaelic to the Phoenician is no greater than that of the Gaelic to the Japanese or to the Shilhic or to the Malayan as we now know from specimens of all It is perfectly understood by every man of the least reading that any two given languages will afford such specimens A learned German has shewn that all tongues whatever have such resem∣blances It is the grammar and form and whole mass of a language not a similarity of a few words that is the criterion The Irish being a language quite in the dark no wonder that it appears a bear a tyger a calf a lion a man a ghost or what you please in the midnight around it Let us await with patience till other antiquaries with new whims find Japanese African Malayan Tar∣tarian colonies in Ireland and then the cool reader will answer them all at once with the single word  nonsense  Having now it is hoped past the morasses of folly let us proceed on solid ground The reader has seen that the first population of Ireland was in every probability from Gaul The Wild Irish confessedly the original inhabitants call themselves Gael and their speech Gaelic Caesar informs us that  Kelts  was the indigenal name  Gauls  a name given by the Romans It is therefore apparent that the primitive Irish called themselves Kelts and their speech Keltic and i am told there are woods in Ireland called  Coit Keltich  or Keltic Woods at this day The origin of names is quite uncertain and especially in the Celtic language which is so lax vague and indefinite but a ques∣tion arises how the wild Irish droped the indigenal name Kelts and assumed the Roman appellation Gael or Gauls On many occasions as is well known nations and societies exchange the name  they give themselves for a general foreign term tho even of reproach Thus sprang the names of Arabs Quakers Hugonots c Indeed this is necessarily the case for it is needless to retain a name only known to a particular nation or so∣ciety while all its neighbours concur in giv∣ing it another and it is forced in every inter∣course with it's neighbours to adopt the general term There is a confusion of words in the Celtic language naturally arising from the confused and misty ideas well known to be peculiar to the peo∣ple Thus the most opposite terms almost coa∣lesce  Ear  is the East  Iar  is the West  Gal  is a foreigner  Gaël  a native The confusion arising from this proximity may easily be guest  Galli  or foreigners must have been the name originally given by the Celts to the Germans who poured into their country  Gaël  seems the word which the Greeks who in their musical language perverted all foreign names sadly altered to  The Celtic G is indeed so sharply pronounced that it approaches to K Gaël and Kelt may therefore be the same word differently pronounced while the Roman Gallus may be Gal a foreigner If this be granted the question is answered But if Kelt actually so pronounced was the old indigenal term and Gael be Gallus the Roman appellation the name must have been assumed from the Ro∣mans in Britain To the former opinion i rather incline for the Irish language was much softened by the bards as all their antiquaries agree and Ghaëlt may have been the old name softened by Greek and Roman pronunciation to Kelt and by the progress of the Irish language to Gaël  The first colonies that followed the Gauls to Ire∣land seem to have been from Britain Lloyd tells us the general tradition among the Welch that the Cumri expelled the Guidhil from Britain into Ireland a tradition confirmed by several of the oldest names of rivers mountains c in  England and Wales being Gaelic not Cumraig The Celts of Gaul may be infallibly concluded from proximity to have been the first tenants of Britain The Cumri or German Celts seem to have arrived at a much later period and in all probability in consequence of the Gothic progress from the east The Cumri or Northern Celts were far superior to the Gallic Celts in prowess as is clear from their conquest of Gaul in the time of Marius not to speak of the constant superior hardiness of northern nations The Guidhil or Gael fled before them and Ireland received them Population was then very thin but perhaps as many Gaël proceeded on this occasion to Ireland as had formerly passed from Gaul They were one identic people with the first colonies who no doubt with open arms received such a reinforce∣ment of brethren This event closed the original population of Ireland and the Wild Irish are thus partly from Gaul partly from Britain  The Alien Colonies now claim attention It is highly probable that when the Belgae or Goths first came to Britain about years before our aera a great number of the Cumri were driven to Ireland Richard of Cirencester says under the year of the world that is by his calculation about years before our aera  Circa haec tempora in Hyberniam commigrarunt ejecti a Belgis Brittones ibique sedes posuerunt ex illo tempore Scotti appellati  In the later point he is certainly mistaken for the name Scotti was a far later appellative and was given to the Scythae of Ireland But that many Cumri or  Brittones  passed about that time into Ireland there is every reason to believe  So much for the Celtic or savage colonization of Ireland We now come to the colonies of rude Goths then a barbarous people but always ad∣vancing in society while the Celts remained as they were A barbarous people is indeed as much superior to a savage one as a civilized to a bar∣barous  Savage nations were the  of the Greeks the  Feri  of the Romans while the name of  and  Barbari  they some  imes gave to nations as polished as themselves Of savages there can be no history while that of barbarians is often preserved and is most interesting as it marks the history of man the progress of society As the history of North America is the history not of the savage natives but of the English there so the history of Europe is that of the Goths in Europe that of Ireland is that of the Goths in Ireland  That the Goths had arrived at the extremity of Germany and penetrated into Gaul about years before our aera is shewn in the annexed Dissertation That the Belgae a part of these Gorths had past to Britain and peopled all the south and east of present England is clear from Caesar who came to Britain years before the Christian epoch From the full state of that popu∣lation and other incidents mentioned by Caesar it seems certain that not less than two or three centuries could possibly effect it and it may there∣fore be safely argued that the Belgae had begun to colonize Britain at least years before Christ's birth That they had past to Ireland much about the same time may be thus shewn From Ptolemy's description of Ireland written about years after Christ it is clear that the Menapii a people of the coast of Belgic Gaul held at that time large possessions in the south of Ireland as did the Cauci a people of Germany originally on the coast north of the Rhine Now it seems certain that these nations could not have past to Ireland either in Roman times or even in times of which the memory was recent when Caesar came to Britain For Caesar Diodorus Siculus Strabo Mela Pliny Tacitus who all describe Ireland Gaul Germany could never have been silent about this event while they so  minutely detail the origins of any nations that they could discover Commerce rendered Ireland well known to the Romans of Ptolemy's time as is clear from his geography of it which is very accu∣rate for the age Tacitus indeed observes that in his time the ports of Ireland were more visited by merchants than those of Britain the cause of which seems to me to have been that the commer∣cial articles of Britain were now consumed by the hometrade of the Romans actually living in Bri∣tain so that merchants applied to Ireland for the skins c The imports must also have been much lessened because the Roman manufacturers supplied the natives with copper and iron earthen ware c while the consumption of those articles in Ireland where there were no Roman manufac∣turers must have remained in full force By this trade with Ireland that country in Ptolemy's time was as much known to the Romans as Japan or any country traded to by Europeans is to us Had the Menapii and Cauci past from Germany and Belgic Gaul to Ireland in Roman times it seems impossible that this event could escape so many writers Pliny in particular that curious investigator had served in Germany and written Twenty Books on the German Wars before he began his Natural History yet had not heard of this colonization Caesar who describes Ireland Gaul and Germany knew nothing of it tho from his work it be plain that he was verst in the traditional history of the Gauls and Germans I be∣lieve it will therefore be granted that this coloni∣zation must have been much more ancient than Caesar's time and that if we allow it to have hap∣pened two or three centuries before that time we shall be as near the truth as possible in a case of this kind The Belgae and the Cauci their neigh∣bours seeing the success of their brethren in Bri∣tain woud naturally be instigated to similar ex∣cursions The passage to Ireland was longer but  the acquisition easier as the Cumri or Northern Celts of Britain were the victors of those very Gael or Southern Celts who held Britain The Goths had in Britain to encounter the victors in Ireland the vanquished As this was the case perhaps the Gothic settlement in Ireland even preceded that in Britain for such affairs do not proceed on a fanciful mechanism But as no cer∣tainty can ever be acquired on either side in this question it seems most proper with the allow∣ance usually made in such cases to date both events about one and the same time years before our aera  That the Menapii and Cauci were not the only Belgic or German nations that then passed to Ire∣land there is every reason to infer In Britain there were Belgae proper and many tribes of Belgae with various names not found on the con∣tinent In Ireland the  Eblani  on the north of the Cauci proper seem a Caucic tribe The  Luceni  seem to have been of the  Leuaci  who lay next to the Menapii in Belgic Gaul  Leuac  and  Luc  being similar and  en  only the German plural The  Au∣teri  may have been  Atrebates  also a people near the Menapii in their original seats The  Velabri  may have been of the  Velocassi  on the shore of Belgic Gaul the last syllables being varied epi∣thets The  Vodii  apparently bear a German name  Vodo  goriacum was a town of the Nervii  Itin Aug Tak Peut Bodo  briga of the Treveri The Teuto  Bodiaci  were part of the Galatae who were Germans  and the  Iverni  from their situation and name seem to have been Belgae Mr O'Conor allows that hardly one of Ptolemy's names admits of a Celtic derivation and the probable inference is that the chief nations were not of Celtic origin The greater part of Ireland was certainly subdued by the Belgae and rude towns and forts erected by them to maintain the conquest The Celts having  now no further refuge could not fly from the con∣queror but remained the numerous population of the ile and their language of course in time prevailed But the power of the Belgae even Irish history and tradition imply For  Bolg  signi∣fies to this day a nobleman and also a man of science and there are many old fortified hills still called  Dun Bolg  or forts of the Belgae  As the Belgae entered on the South of Ireland the Celts would naturally crowd to the North About two hundred years before Christ a vast number of Cumri retired thither from present Scotland upon the entrance of the Piks into that country as before shewn It appears from Pto∣lemy that three British tribes had also settlements in Ireland namely the  Coriondi  or  Coritani  and  Brigantes  in the South and the  Voluntii  in the North These tribes seem to have been naturally directed in their choice by their Gothic and Celtic origin The  Coritani  and  Brigantes  Go∣thic neighbours in Britain settled on the South of Ireland The  Voluntii  Celts of Cumberland set∣tled on the North among their Celtic brethren Richard dates this migration fiftytwo years after Christ and says these nations retired to Ireland from the Roman arms which seems very probable He adds the  Cangi  as a fourth tribe as he takes the  Gangani  of Ptolemy to be  Cangani  but of this let every one think as he sees proper The same writer tells us that the  Menapii  and  Cauci  were in∣faillibly  nationes Teutonicae originis  'nations of Teu∣tonic origin' that the time of their arrival was not known but probably as he guesses a little before Caesar's time The reader has above seen argu∣ments for a dare yet a little earlier  Thus were the Belgae and German Goths estab∣lished in the south of Ireland A most curious and important question now arises namely if any Scandinavian Goths seized on the north of  Ireland in early times This is a hinge upon which the whole history of Ireland turns  That fabulous progeny the Tuath de Danan are here out of all question If they passed from pre∣sent Scotland as all the Irish accounts bear they were clearly Damnii a Cumraig people that fled before the Piks If they were Danes they must be those who in the eighth century for the first time appeared in Ireland I incline after more labour and investigation than any part of Irish ori∣gins has cost me to give this grand question the negative or to think that no Scandinavians ap∣peared in Ireland before the eighth century upon the following grounds  What seems totally to negative the question at first is that there is no mention of the Scan∣dinavians of any Danes or Norwegians in Ireland before the eighth century in Tighernac the annals of Ulster or other authentic documents of real Irish history In Cumineus Adomnan writers of the seventh century not a trace of Scandinavian invasion can be found The prophecies of Co∣lumba could hardly pass such an evil had he foreseen what had never happened Gildas Nen∣nius Beda are also quite silent Sir James Ware therefore rightly says that in  primum  for the FIRST time the Northern nations infested Ire∣land as the Irish annals bear It may be thought that as the Piks came from Norway to the He∣budes and entered upon their conquest of pre∣sent Scotland on that side about years before Christ their Gothic brethren of Norway and Denmark might naturally be imagined to have made other incursions that way But history does not bear such analogical reasoning and human affairs proceed not upon mechanical or upon the∣oretic principles In fact the effect was in this instance destructive of the cause For the Pikish and Danish colonies were so large that they may well be inferred to have exhausted the Scandina∣vian  population so much as to leave no occasion for emigration for a long time This was the case with the Angli Saxons c In ancient times the Lydians as Herodotus states formed an emigration of one half of the nation but no more Lydians went to Hetruria afterward The Danes were themselves but a late Scandinavian colony and their population must have been a long time only sufficient for their own territory The  Vitae  and  Angli  seem the first colony they sent out and that only in the fifth and sixth centuries They are therefore out of the question The Scandinavians were exhausted by the Pikish and Danish colonies The former they might also in these dark ages regard as possest of all the iles on the west and have of course no temptation to invade their own countrymen Certain it is that no trace can be found of Danes or Norwegians invading Scotland till the ninth century Nor a single trace in all the Irish annals of any northern nations by any name whatever assailing Ireland till About years after Christ as ap∣pears from the Pikish chronicle a large colony of Piks settled in the north of Ireland and they are remarkable to a late period in Irish annals c by the name of Cruthneans the Irish term for the Piks They had their own kings and are a marked people till the ninth century Had any Scandinavians been in that tract there is reason to question if the Piks could have effected a set∣tlement It is indeed no wonder that the Scan∣dinavian sagas and histories silent about the Piks Vitae and Angli should be silent about this and if any saga should speak of invasions of Ireland or Scotland prior to the eighth century no cre∣dit can be paid to those pieces written many cen∣turies after and in which early chronology is quite confounded Concerning Prolemy's names of na∣tions in the north of Ireland  Darnii  or  D  mnii  as Richard from older and better MSS reads  Ve∣nicnii  Robogdii Nagnati Erdini  i have consulted a learned Northern antiquary who informs m  that they are not Scandinavian names Had the Scandinavians made any invasions on Ireland they would also as in later times have attacked the western shores of Britain while there is not a hint of this to be found in Roman writers who only mention the Scots of Ireland as invading the western shore and Saxons the east It may fluc∣tuate in the minds of some that as the Piks years before Christ came from Scandinavia to the Hebudes and thence conquered and peopled pre∣sent Scotland so it seems probable that other in∣vaders would follow that tract to the north of Ire∣land long before the year after Christ But the fact is that this same large colony of Piks would be of necessity the very cause of prevent∣ing similar invasions in that course till the me∣mory of it had expired For Caledonia and the north of Ireland were filled with Piks or in other words with Scandinavians which no doubt the Scandinavians perfectly knew from the inter∣course of single ships or trading vessels So that they would never think of attacking their country∣men till length of time had extinguished all such considerations In future times they did not at∣tack Iceland lately colonized but Scotland whose connexion was lost It may be said that England presents an exception to this remark the Angli having only arrived in and being at∣tacked by the Danes in the beginning of the ninth century But the Angli tho of Scandina∣vian origin as the Danes were quite a distinct nation not only from the ancient Danes but from the Iutes their northern neighbours The Iutes had their own kings and so had the Angli as appears from Suhm's history of Denmark and other works So late as Regnar Lodbrog king of Denmark was occupied in conquering the Iutes The Angli were still more remote from  Denmark than the Iutes The Danes in attack∣ing the Angli of Britain warred against a people always distinct from themselves while the Scan∣dinavians and Piks were divisions of the same identic people Besides the cases are in another view not parallel for the Angli were only the  conquerors  who settled among the inhabitants of Northumbria and were soon lost among the in∣habitants The Piks on the contrary were the  people  of Caledonia The Piks formed a great colony and doubtless as the Islandic brought wives and family with them or sent for them when the ground was secured Like the Lydians of Hetruria they may have been a vast discon∣tented party or indeed like many modern colo∣nies On the first arrival of the Goths in Scandi∣navia as they had enemies to subdue they must have proceeded in armies and have formed large states under one government as appears from Ta∣citus in his account of the Suiones or Danes and Sitones or Swedes all the former of whom obeyed one king the later one queen Of course in these early times the emigrating parties must have been very large and in proportion to the states But in time when the danger of the grand Ge∣neric foe as the Fins for instance was abated the warlike spirit of the Goths broke out often among themselves and split them into numerous petty kingdoms and states as we know was the case in Norway till the ninth century and in Denmark and Sweden tho not quite so long In Britain the Piks were kept together from constant danger of the Cumri their southern neighbours so we learn of no divisions among them save con∣tentions for the crown But in Scandinavia the Fins being driven beyond the Bothnic gulf and the Vends inhabiting only the south of the Baltic the Goths were secure from Generic foes and often immersed in domestic wars and split into con∣tending states Those domestick wars weakened  them much till seven or eight centuries after Christ when monarchs of superior talents subdued the rest and formed again into one powerful state what security from foreign foes had divided soon after the Generic foe was subdued Attention to all these circumstances becomes necessary to form a proper judgment upon this question The rea∣der must reflect on the three grand stages of Scan∣dinavian government  Great states united un∣der one supreme power against a Generic foe  Those states split into small ones by diffen∣tion from security and from want of a common foe  Great states formed by the small ones being subdued by one monarch as the heptarchies of England  The middle stage of small states is the most unsuitable for emigration because the po∣pulation is consumed by domestic war In the first and third stages alone the Scandinavian co∣lonies emigrated Considering the Piks therefore in this light during the first stage or till about a century after Christ the memory of this grand western colony was quite recent and the Scandi∣navians could no more dream of sending out fresh colonies or of invading that quarter than we of sending colonies to North America or the Spaniards to the South already in their own oc∣cupation During the second stage till seven or eight centuries after our aera domestic war en∣gaged all attention and destroyed population so that no colonies nor invaders could be sent Dur∣ing the third stage fresh invasions naturally arose From all these reasons it seems clear that before the year the Scandinavians never invaded Ire∣land Indeed he who asserts that they did must do it upon his own authority as the negative testimony of all the ancients Roman and British and Irish is most cogent against him Such being the state of the question the Scandinavians are to be regarded as having no part in Irish origins  The ancient history of Ireland is therefore the history of the Belgic and German Goths in Ireland And the reader having thus seen the detail of Irish origins it remains to consider the name of Scots  Many etymologies have been given of the word  Scot  All the more ancient writers concur in re∣presenting it as the same with  Scyth  or  Scythian  an opinion which prevailed till the present century Of the late Dr Macpherson supposes  Scuit  or  Scot  to signify a  small body  of men Mr Whita∣ker  wanderers  or  refugees  Others more plausibly derive it from  Coit  a wood or from  Schut  a boat or small vessel as Ireland abounded with woods and the Scots attacked Britain in such ves∣sels Others from  Scutten  to shoot  An opinion which on ignorant representation seems erroneous will often when supported on due grounds assume quite another appearance The first etymon of  Scot  as the same with  Scyth  or Scythian seemed to me most ridiculous as the Scots of Ireland as soon as known in history spoke the Celtic tongue But on the slightest reflec∣tion this was found no argument for the Franks or French tho still so called do not speak Francic but the corrupted Roman of Gaul where they settled The Normans of France in two centuries after settling spoke not Norman but Romance also The Angli spoke not Danish after fixing here but the Belgic of England All these na∣tions with many others retained their name tho they changed their language In short a small nation settling in any country may retain it's name may give it to all the country yet will ever lose it's speech in that of the population of the country Such are human affairs and hence gross impropriety rises for the French language is not the French but the Roman the English not English but Belgic the IrishScotish not Scy∣thic but Celtic  It is shewn in the annexed Dissertation that SCYTHAE was the grand generic name of the furthest Germans on the west And that SCOT is synony∣mous with SCYTH and was the name originally and generically borne by the Belgae and Germans who conquered Ireland will appear from the fol∣lowing arguments  All the Irish accounts bear that the Scots landed in the south of Ireland and from thence subdued the old inhabitants a de∣scription only applicable to the Belgae and Ger∣mans  The Scots infested Britain from the eastern shore of Ireland which we know from Ptolemy was held by the Germans and Belgae  The Celts of Gaul and of Britain were easily subdued by the Romans and gave them no fur∣ther disturbance The Scots of Ireland were ever making incursions into the Roman provinces a conduct not at all according with the Celtic cha∣racter  King Alfred in his translation of Beda and an AngloBelgic poem on the Danish wars in the Cotton Library  Vitellius A X  with other writers of that time use  Scytisc  for Scotish familiarly so that  Scyt  and  Scot  were synonymous and the only Scythae implied must be the Belgae and Germans for the Piks of the north of Ireland are out of the question not settling there till about A D long after the Scotish monarchy was established in Ireland and being possessed of but one corner  By all the Irish accounts the Scots were the people who came last to Ireland on the south before Christianity and vanquished the old in∣habitants a description only applicable to the Belgae and Germans Late Irish writers distin∣guish the Belgae or FirBolg from the Scots but represent the later as leagued with the former in vanquishing the Tuath de Dannan The Fir Bolg were a part of the Scots as the Angli were of the Goths who came to England The mention  of a particular name argues not that name to be of a different generic people  The Irish writers uniformly say that the Scots were Scythians and so Nennius tells us expressly and the Belgae and Germans were the only Scythians we find at the time in Ireland so that the Belgae and Germans must have been the Scots  Diodorus Siculus re∣peatedly names the very country from whence the Cauci went 'Scythia above Gaul' as shewn in the Dissertation added If we deny the Scots to have been Scythians we must reject all the Irish accounts ancient and modern But if Scythians they could only come from the Scythic territories in Germany and Gaul For the Gothic colonies in the north of Spain are out of the question the Gothic nations in Ireland identifying their Belgic and German origin by their names  Menapii Cauci  c Other arguments might be added  The reader may consult Innes Vol II p  s  qq  for proofs that the Scots were quite a distinct people from the Wild Irish and conquerors of the later St Patrick in his Epistles evinces this The  Scoti  whom he generally marks as  Reguli  and  Nobiles  he uniformly distinguishes from the  Hyberionae  and  Hybernigenae  terms for the commonalty  but it is believed that these may suffice to shew that the Scots were those Scythae namely the Belgae and Germans who vanquished Ireland The reason why Nennius and other writers of the middle ages who expressly tell us that the Scots were Scythae yet represent them as coming from Spain was that absurd etymology of  Ibernia  from  Iberia  But it is now granted on all hands that Hibernia is a name arising from the  western  situation of this fine iland and that Scotia is an appellation arising from the Scots settling in it So that this opinion of the Scots having come from Spain or Iberia sprung from a ridiculous etymology and is be∣neath all notice being of a piece with the Brutus of Geoffrey of Monmouth The names of the Scotish kings in Ireland are also Gothic not Celtic  Such is  Leogaire  the first Christian king for who is ignorant that Leogaire is also the name of a Francic king and is a German name  Leofgard  'a keeper of love' as Leopold Leonard c Some of the names of Scotish or Irish kings are no doubt Celtic epithets given them by their peo∣ple but others are mere Gothic names Such are  Conary  or  Conrad Hugh Hugony Nial  is quite a Gothic name familiar in Runic monuments and Icelandic sagas Are not the  O'Brians  from the  Briani  of Belgic Gaul The Celtic language changes almost all words to it's own form and even in the Irish bible the names are forced to be changed and accommodated to that odd speech Thus  Alexander  can only be put  Alisdair Adam  is  Adhamh Andrew  is  Aindra Bartholomew  is  Par∣tholan Daniel  is  Donuil David  is  Dabhi Gideon Gideeon James Semis John Eoin Peter Phedair Samuel Somhairle  c c c Such being the case the strange perversion of Gothic names in the Celtic language is easily accounted for My present subject forbids my entering at full length into this point but from perusal of the Annals of Ulster i am fully convinced that the names of not only the Irish monarchs but of most of the provincial king∣lets are Gothic  But long before Christianity was settled in Ire∣land perhaps indeed before the birth of Christ the Scots or Scythae who conquered Ireland had lost their speech in that of the greater number of the Celts the common people as usually hap∣pens From England and Scotland the Celts had crouded to the west and vast numbers had past to Ireland The mountainous north and west of Eng∣land the friths of Scotland had formed barriers between the Goths and Celts But in Ireland the grand and last receptacle of the Celts and whither almost their whole remains finally flowed it is no wonder that the Gothic conquerors the Scots lost their speech in that of the population  In Britain the Celts who remained were much improved by Roman intercourse and the supe∣riority of the Welch to the Irish Celts appears in the laws of Howel Dha in their historic fables in the superior accuracy of their language and in the name they gave and give the Irish Celts  Guydhil  or  Wild Men  Originally indeed the Northern Celts or Cumri were superior to the Southern or Gael in strength of mind and body as the conquests of the former over the later prove The Wild Irish are at this day known to be some of the veriest savages in the globe and seem by nature intended as a medial race between beasts and men The chief families in Ireland and the industrious and civilized part of the people are all of Gothic descent as Scots Danes Norwe∣gians and laterly English and modern Scots What interest they can have therefore in support∣ing the Celtic visions which far from honouring really disgrace their country it were difficult to say did not we see national prejudice another name for national madness often swallow up every spark of discernment The English till the present century were fighting for the Welch anti∣quities as doing honour to their nation and the Scots are following the same tract to this day The bards and sennachies authors of all this perdition to the history of Great Britain and Ire∣land were strollers of the genuine Celtic breed  So much for the origin of the Scots  The origin of the Scots above given is confirmed by Ware who shews that  Scythae  and  Scotti  were but different names for the same people and both are called  Scutten  by the Germans Ware quotes Diceto who says 'E regione qua∣dam quae dicitur Scythia dicitur Scita Sciticus Scotus Sco∣tia' and Walsingham who has the same idea Reinec  ius in his Historia Julia says the ancient name of Scythians is still retained by the Scots Nay the Welch as Camden ob∣serves call both Scythi  ns and Scots  Yscot  The old Chro∣nicon Rhythmicum Innes App says  Dicitur a Getia Geticus seu Gothia Gothi  Dicitur a Scithia Scithicus sic Scotia Scoti  Eccard in his Origines Germanicae has curious remarks confirming the German origin of the Irish Goths such as "Restant in Frisiorum et Hibe  norum lingua quae arcte conve∣niunt atque in reliquis dialectis vix reperiuntur" The Cauci were in Frisia An author of the XIth century Innes p says the Scoti were first called  Chorisci  query if the  Cher  sci  of Germany  and i beg leave to subjoin a hint or two concerning the  early Irish history which is that of the Scots or Goths in Ireland That they subdued Ireland with united arms and divided it as usual among their chiefs and soldiers is apparent from all Irish writers ancient and modern and inferable from others as Orosius Beda c who represent Ire∣land as fully possest by the Scots The nature of the acquisition would in all likelihood render the several divisions monarchic and one monarch or other would be acknowledged superior as we learn from Caesar was the case among the states of Gaul In other countries vanquished by the Goths the Celts totally retired apart as did the Welch when the Saxons came here and the vic∣tors sometimes formed monarchies sometimes re∣publics being all freemen and having no con∣quered subjects to keep under But in Ireland that grand refuge of Celtic population the states could not be republican as three quarters of the subjects could form no part of the government so that it must in all appearance have remained military that is monarchic In this all the Irish accounts agree and in when Patrick went to Ireland we find Leogaire  Rex Hiberniae  king of Ireland by eminence The idea asserted by Maitland and some others that Leogaire was the first king of this supreme title is chi  dish and in∣vidious We might as justly reject all the Danish Swedish and Norwegian annals prior to Chris∣tianity's  being established in those countries How far back the kings of Ireland can be named with certainty becomes not me to say who have not seen the original documents This is therefore submitted to the antiquaries of that kingdom Mr O'Conor  Dissertations  dates the commencement of the genuine list at the establishment of the palace of supreme royalty at Emania in Ulster seven gene∣rations or about years before our aera The Pagan period of Irish history seems to fall into two divisions The OBSCURE from the arrival of the Scots till the reign of Tuathal the Acceptable about years after Christ and The DAWNING from the reign of Tuathal till Patrick's arrival in after which all is clear Mr O'Conor  Il  d  re∣marks that Tuathal's reign forms a new and cer∣tain epoch in the progress of Irish history Fo∣reigners may imagine that it is granting too much to the Irish to allow them lists of kings more an∣cient than of any other country in modern Europe but the singularly compact and remote situation of that iland and it's freedom from Roman con∣quest and from the concussions of the fall of the Roman empire may infer this allowance not too much But all contended for is the list of kings so easily preserved by the repetition of bards at high solemnities and some grand events of history For to expect a certain detail and regular order in the pagan history of Ireland were extravagant The Irish antiquists will on the other hand ex∣claim against this rejection of so many fables which they call and perhaps if the human mind can be so debased really think history Mr O'Conor says that the period from Tuathal to Leogaire is the most useful and important of the whole heathen history of Ireland In which he is certainly right and the traditions and bardish rhymes with the early attention of the Irish after  conversion to such learning as was then in vogue promise considerably veracity to this last pagan pe∣riod Sir James Ware was confessedly ignorant of the Irish language so that his rejection of all the pagan history of Ireland was at best rash But indeed the Irish writers like the dog in the fable lose the substance by grasping at the shadow and their falsehoods are so wild that it is no wonder they nauseate the public against the whole The claim of letters in Ireland preceding Christianity is alone sufficient to cause the rejection of the whole early history of that country by all the literati of Europe and he who asserts such a glaring false∣hood is the bitterest enemy of his country and in his madness disgraces when he means to honour But it is the duty of a cool enquirer after truth not to allow the frenzy of such writers to hurt any cause which they either attack or defend  SECTION II  Progress of the Old Scots or Dalriads from Ireland to North Britain  IT is with infinite concern that toward the close of the Eighteenth century i am forced to contend against modern errors in Scotish antiqui∣ties that would have disgraced the Thirteenth Superficiality is the parent of error and in anti∣quities a subject requiring the utmost labour and most profound and exuberant reading it is no wonder that the fruit of superficiality is monstrous Classical learning as it is called that is a little dabbling in Greek and Roman classics has in all ages formed the sum total of Scotish literature In the present especially even our little learning has gradually lessened and  philosophy  or really  reasoning ignorance  supplies it's place If philo∣sophy has not extinguished common sense among us we must know that human history proceeds upon no theoretic principles but upon facts  eternally contradictive of all theory and that these facts can only be found in ancient authorities To judge of antiquities upon a slight acquaintance with the classics and with philosophic theory is so absurd that to mention such an idea is to ex∣cite laughter Yet it is a lamentable truth that such is the plan of examining Scotish origins among all our writers of this century save Innes The authors of the middle ages the genuine foun∣tains of information are not even known by name to our puerile scribblers The gold of truth which is hid deep in the soil they look for upon the sur∣face of classic reading and in the open day of phi∣losophy Antiquities the severest of all studies in learned countries are in mine the amusement as they call it of mere boys who would any where else be sent to school Puerile errors have begot puerile prejudices and in the frenzy of those prejudices against a respectable nation the Irish it is risible to see our antiquists forget that even judging by those prejudices it is more dis∣graceful to the Scots to have been the fathers of the Irish than the contrary For is it more dishonour∣able to have a foolish father or a foolish son  It is needless to enter into any discussion of that absurd question Whether the old Scots proceeded from Ireland to North Britain or from North Bri∣tain to Ireland That progress is detailed in the two following chapters All that can be said to our Scotish antiquists is Read and read as on any other subject without prejudice A few hints shall however be given after premising that the origin of the PRESENT Scots or people so called after the Eleventh century is not here discussed but reserved for afterconsideration It is that of the old Scots in Britain otherwise called Dalriads which is here examined The origin of the opi∣nion that the old Scots proceeded to Ireland from North Britain may well be supposed Celtic that is in the inverse ratio of reason and is accordingly  to be first found in Lloyd's Archaeologia printed in tho only in general terms concerning the progress of the Guydhil or Gaël from Britain to Ireland Dr Mackenzie in the preface to his Scotish Writers published in greedily pur∣sued this scent and like a young hound yelped much but caught no prey Gordon followed in a most impudent and lying section of his  Itinerarium Septentrionale  London folio Yet Innes whose book was published in seems to have looked on this new opinion as beneath notice for he says nothing of it This favourite plant of ignorance still thrived and assumed fresh vigour in Maitland's History of Scotland and in Goodal's Introduction to Fordun And lastly the two Macphersons have dunged it afresh in recent publications In vain did Robert∣son and Hume testify against it A new plan of investigating antiquities was introduced for Scot∣land exclusively Other countries rest ancient facts totally upon ancient authorities but for Scotland all authorities were to be cut down The word of command was "Put out the candles that we may see the clearer"  It was my design to have laid before the reader a numerical abstract of all the arguments advanced by Maitland Goodal and the Macphersons against the Irish extract of the old Scots of Britain and to give answers in like order But after care∣ful and repeated perusal of those doughty cham∣pions i was forced to relinquish the design lest the reader should imagine that i was sporting at his ex∣pence and fighting with shades of utter ignorance and folly of my own creation in order that my great wisdom should appear conspicuous in the victory Another grand reason was that i really could not find one argument used by these writers that would bear a repetition To any man who with Democritus delights in laughing at the madness of mankind there cannot be a greater  feast than the perusal of the Scotish and Irish con∣test on their origins Much cunning upon one side much weakness on the other while that su∣preme goddess Ignorance sits umpire and deals out her equal favours in the largest proportion to both parties On the Irish side nothing can be charged but a shameful credulity and obduracy in ancient fable But our Scotish antiquists ignorant themselves and writing in a country remarkable for ignorance of antiquities are like other rogues emboldened by darkness and venture on tricks that the most unprincipled man of learning would in a learned country tremble at as if the pillory stood before him This censure may be thought severe but Truth whispers me that it is not suffi∣ciently severe for the occasion  These four Scotish champions of falsehood have had the honour to introduce quite a new style of composition The only arguments they use are of two kinds Railing against all ancient autho∣rities which by a madness unknown in any other country they think they can  confute  Assertions totally false and impudent Far from being learned they have not even those ideas which lead to learning and thus their arguments far from being accurate are unscientific nay irrational and such as never were used before in any literary question whatever Their heat is so extreme as to excite utter disgust and to merit being repressed by all the indignation of insulted science The Ossian Macpherson in particular uses a most extra∣vagant style He says he has  finally decided  the question a question of ancient facts and circum∣stances from his dabling in modern Gaelic while there is not one MS in Gaelic upon the matter A boy at school would know that a man may be able to speak nay read English and yet not de∣cide upon English origins But such are Celtic understandings The style of the later writer is indeed peculiarly Celtic hyperbolic and bom∣bastic  Genius in Ossian was well but in a ques∣tion of this kind it is frenzy The only powers of mind to be exerted are learning clear and cool comprehension veracity and penetration But Mr Macpherson pretends to build a house with a sword and he has only wounded himself A book like his is indeed sufficient to  decide  a question for if ignorance and falsehood be on one side it follows that learning and truth will be on the other  These strange writers have betrayed me into a style perhaps unworthy of my purpose but which they deserve Good manners are not to be shewn to all else what difference between the worthy and unworthy part of society Indignation belongs to virtue and to science also And how answer writers who childishly take the Hibernia of the an∣cients for Scotland the Ierne of Greek and Ro∣man writers for Stratherne the Mona of Caesar for Aemona in the frith of Forth  Tethyca vallis  Gildas whose work is a strange poetical rant or rather prose run mad uses  vallis  for the sea as Claudian  Nec multo spatii distantibus aequore vallis  In Ruf  II  uses a sea of space for land  Thetica vallis  is the valley of Thetis goddess of the sea So  firth  'a plain' is now applied to sea  for Menteith c c c May that power from whom the holy right of reason springs pre∣vent mine from being debased so far Not content with assertions absolutely false such as that the Highlanders call their country  Caeldoch  that the Irish call their language  Gaelich Eirinach  c c c they refer most falsely to authorities which when examined confute them nay totally per∣vert interpolate and mangle those authorities which they quote What name shall we apply to such practices happily quite unknown in other countries Indeed i am apt to think that in some countries the antiquaries form an exception to the  national character My countrymen are deservedly noted for probity their antiquaries are just the reverse Their sacrifice of all truth to what they call the honour of Scotland is proverbial Deluded men Can any honour spring from falsehood The people of England are solid and sensible their antiquaries generally most visionary The French are gay and frivolous their antiquaries grave and solid Let us then leave the  lana caprina  of confuting these writers to oblivion that silent confuter of such attempts Mr Macpherson has been happily confuted by Mr Whitaker who has set nonsense against nonsense For Ossian and Richard of Cirencester are the authors upon whom Mr Whitaker confutes the father of Ossian Ossian and La Morte Arthur which last Mr W ranks against Gildas and Beda and gives a long history of king Arthur from it were just fit to produce that nonsense which would counterpoize any other nonsense So that Mr M and Mr W and perfectly matched in judgement and skill and we are much obliged to Mr W for proving to us that Mr M's theory could not stand against non∣sense itself  Risu solvantur tabulae tu missus abibis  Not to waste time in a formal refutation of such writers as Maitland Goodal and the Macphersons it is sufficient to observe that all this work is a silent confutation of them for by establishing the truth all errors fa  l before it  One point deserves consideration Mr Macpher∣son has most ingenuously and ingeniously observed that on the first mention of the Scots by Ammianus Marcellinus at the year we find them in Britain and  ergo  the Scots were settled in Britain before they were in Ireland By the same rule as Ammianus at the year mentions the Saxons in Britain they were also settled in Britain But the fact is that Ammianus in both places is speak∣ing of the nations that invaded the Roman pro∣vinces  in Britain This is a specimen of the argu∣ments of those Scotish antiquists and the rest are of the same stamp so that the reader may judge whether they deserve answer or only laughter Mr M is however forced to yield to that glaring and invincible truth supported by all antiquity that the name of  Scotia  was long borne by Ireland before given to Scotland The truth is as after fully shewn in this work that from the Fourth Century to the Eleventh the names  Scotia  and  Scoti  belonged solely to Ireland and the Irish In the reign of Malcom II or take at a medium the middle of this reign and say about the year the name  Scotia  was first applied to North Britain but from its first appearance to that time it belonged to Ireland alone No foreigner has been misled by the pitiful prejudices and falsehoods of our Scotish dablers Cellarius Eccard Schoep∣flin D'Anville the learned editors of the Histo∣riens de France Suhm c c c have all agreed in this point But of this afterward If therefore priority of name argues priority of pos∣session the Scots must have come from Ireland to Scotland But this inference is not beyond con∣troversy For the people may have gone from Scotland to Ireland some will say and the name of Scots have been there given them yet after∣ward by some strange contingence have reverted to the parent country That such a contingence is quite unknown to any other history would not be a sufficient answer for analogy tho useful in such cases is not absolute proof If any writer were to attempt to prove that Greece far from being the parent country of Magna Graecia was actually peopled from it in what way is he to be confuted The probability is indeed equal on both sides to speak for once as a Scotish antiquist and the grand mark that of identic language may be applied either way It is certain therefore that the only information we can have on this or  any other subject of ancient history is that de∣rived from ancient authorities and in this pe∣culiar and great instance from the Tradition of the people themselves Now all writers English Scotish and Irish from Beda down to this supersicial century agree in this point that the Ancient Scots of North Britain were a colony from Ireland And in all ages the Scotish highlanders have assented and the lowlanders from Barbour in to this moment call the highlanders Irishry and their language Irish Erish or Erse This clear inference is fully confirmed by all the ancient accounts of the progress of the old Scots in Britain now about to be detailed and is so firmly rooted in the whole ancient history of Britain and Ireland that nothing but ignorance joined with frenzy could attempt to shake it Indeed igno∣rance the deepest ignorance was necessary to such an attempt for profound ignorance judges of others by itself and thinks that dark and dubi∣ous to all which is dark and dubious to itself alone while others see it in the brightest day An ignorant man will talk of opinion in the mathe∣matics because he can form no idea how certain they are Opinion is the safe harbour of ignorance and a benighted mind flies to it as a covert from utter shame He who would call it matter of opinion whether the Greeks proceeded from Magna Graecia or to it would be regarded as a mere ignorant and the progress of the old Scots from Ireland is far more clear and rests upon more numerous grounds than the former Before i had in the least examined this subject i saw it in the dark and thought it doubtful nay really bellived from general theory that the Irish Scots had past from Scotland When i had exa∣mined it i saw that i had been totally wrong and that the contrary was from ancient writers and innumerable other lesser lights and cir∣cumstances only acquirable in a thorough exami∣nation as clear as day Let those who doubt  therefore only read and examine with a mere desire of knowing the truth and satisfying their own minds and no arguments need be used The proofs are so numerous clear and consistent that they afford a perfect blaze of truth as many small lights will at night make a chamber as bright as noon  CHAPTER II  The first Colony of Old Scots in North Britain under Riada about the Year    being the  DALREU∣DINI  or  ATTACOTTI  SOME English and Irish antiquaries as Usher Bishop Lloyd Stillingfleet O'Flaherty c have in their great zeal against the antiquity of the Scots in North Britain past this colony in ob∣livion and represented the second colony in the year as the first settlement The cogent authority of Beda they neglected or railed against That respectable writer in his first chapter gives us the origin of the Britons Piks and Scots in Bri∣tain In his second chapter he proceeds to the wars of Julius Caesar in Britain Had Beda therefore followed strict chronology the Scots by his ac∣count must have been settled in Britain before Cae∣sar's time But the Scots he introduces here from their after connexion with the Piks and that he may proceed to a continuous account of the Ro∣man affairs in Britain In like manner under the year he gives us the origin of the Iutes Saxons and Angli in England tho the Iutes alone arrived in that year and there were no Saxons here till nor Angli till So  lib  I  c  he places Vespasian after Claudius and then passes to Nero and I he puts St Germanus who lived about long after the battle of Badon Nennius a writer of the next century with a still greater neglect of order says  ch  that in Britain at first dwelled  Scoti  Picti atque Saxones et Britones  Yet  ch  he gives us the British origins  ch  the Pikish and  ch  he says  Novissime autem venerunt Scoti a partibus Hispaniae ad Hiberniam  But Beda by giving us the name of the leader of this first colo∣ny enables us to six the date  The words of Beda are  Procedente autem tem∣pore Britannia post Britones et Pictos tertiam Scot∣torum nationem in Pictorum parte recepit Qui duce Reuda de Hibernia egressi vel amicitia vel ferro sibi∣met inter eos sedes quas hactenus habent vindica∣rant A quo videlicet duce usque hodie Dalreudini vocantur nam lingua eorum dal partem significat  'In process of time Britain after the Britons and Piks received a third nation that of the Scots in the part belonging to the Piks Who emigrating from Ireland under their leader Reuda either by friendship or arms vindicated to themselves those seats among them which they to this time hold From which leader they are called Dalreudini to this day for in their language  dal  signifies a part  Dal  or  Dael  is a  part  in the Gothic not in the Celtic in which Dal signifies a  tribe  Kennedy p and is quite common in Irish history An easy metonymy But the Scots of Ireland it is likely retained more of their own Gothic words in their first meanings in Beda's time than after  '  This very preservation of the name of the leader by Beda argues a late settlement and accord∣ingly we find that it took place about the year For the REUDA of Beda is the READA of king Alfred's translation and the RIADA of the ancient Irish writers  But concerning this Riada and his colony the modern Irish authors were long mute Stanihurst and others who at the end of the sixteenth cen∣tury first superficially treated Irish antiquities had seen few or none of the old Irish MSS then in private and unknown hands till Sir James Ware collected them Usher who published his  Antiquitates Eccl Brit  in was a bitter enemy of the Scotish fables and in his zeal denied that the Scots were settled in Britain till Keat∣ing who wrote about the same time from the same motive followed the same course Ware did not understand Irish and his book is so brief that it is not to be wondered that he says nothing of the origin of the Scots in Britain O'Flaherty even contradicts himself as Mr O'Conor shews  Ogygia vindicated  from his zeal against the antiquity of the Scots in Britain and his wish to appropriate to the Irish Scots all the actions against the Romans so that he denies all settlement of the Scots in Britain till And in his "Vindication of Ogygia against Sir G Mackenzie" he insists that the Dalreudini were only settled in the northeast corner of Ireland till a part passed in to Scotland Still later Irish writers have it is believed in their prejudice against Scotish antiquity followed the fame tract but from the greater candour of others the truth has appeared in this century  Kennedy whose book  Genealogical Dissertation on the family of Stuart vo pp  was published at Paris and tho brief is the most accurate known on Irish history as he generally quotes MS page and column first laid open the fact that a colony of Scots under Riada settled in Pikland He tells us p "Our books of antiquity giving an account at large of the children and race of Conar Mac Mogalama king of Ireland mention that he had three sons Carbre Musc Carbre Baskin and Carbre Riada and that the first was by another name Aengus the second Olfill and the third Eocha" And p "Our writers unanimously tell us that Carbre Riada was the founder of the Scotish sovereignty in Britain but they make him only a captain as venerable Beda does or conductor who ingratiated himself so  far with the Picts by his and his childrens as∣sistance and good service against the Britons that they consented that they and their followers should continue among them" In both these passages he gives no authorities tho he commonly pro∣duces them This most foolish and detestable practice prevails to this day in Irish writers adone  Toland in his  Nazarenus  ed London vo has some remarks on the controversy between the Irish and Scotish antiquaries He allows Usher to be in the wrong and places Riada and the first colony in the third century    Mr O'Conor in his Dissertation on the His∣tory of Scotland at the end of his Dissertations on the Irish history Dublin vo is the next and last Irish writer whom i shall quote upon this point He there tells us that in the time of Cormac O'Cuin as O'Flaherty himself acknowleges  Ogyg  part III c an establish∣ment of the Scots was made in North Britain That it was in favour of Carbre Riada a prince of the Degads  Kennedy p says this family was first in Ulster but about years before Christ they were forced to more into Munster under Degad whence they were called Degads of Munster This Degad he adds is the Deachach in the old Scotish genealogies Deaga see Innes p table it need not be observed that all this is  gratis dictum  of Munster cousin of Cormac O'Cuin and son of Conary II who died in That Riada and his immediate posterity ruled that colony as well as another which he had set∣tled in present Antrim and both colonies were from him called  Dalriada  That the Piks at length forced the whole colony in Britain to take flight into Ireland under their leader Eochad Munrevar and they settled in the Irish Dalriada But nei∣ther he nor his son Erc could obtain a reestab∣lishment in North Britain Nor was it effected till the beginning of the sixth century when Loarn son of Erc again fixed the Scots there It appears from this that the retreat of this first  colony happened two generations before or about  Mr O'Conor has on different occasions re∣peated this information In his publication of O'Flaherty's Vindication of Ogygia Dublin vo he gives several notes concerning this settle∣ment but particularly a long one p He there shews that O'Flaherty is contradicting his own words in the Ogygia where speaking of Cormac O'Cuin he says  imperium in Albania exegit  That the greater part of Antrim and a neighbouring part of North Britain were given to Carbre Riada That some Irish senachies con∣firm Beda's testimony That the Irish and British Dalriada were governed by the same family That the sons of Erc in the eighth generation from Carbre Riada reestablished this colony which had suffered much That when Conary II was murdered in his three sons were minors That Carbre Riada one of them distinguishe himself at the battle of Kinfebrat A D That on Cormac's succession to the Irish throne in Carbre Riada was sent against the Cruth∣nii who had rebelled in Ulster That in the war was carried into Albany and the Scots settled there And says that George III descends from Conary thro Riada and the Scotish Albanic line  In the late  Collectanea de Rebus Hibernicis  there are also some letters of Mr O'Conor throwing light on this subject He tells us in one number  Number X  'Foreign alliances were renewed and in particu∣lar with the Cruthenians Piks of North Britain among whom our Carbry Riada the son of Co∣nary II found an establishment for his colony of Scots the first that migrated from Ireland to North Britain" And in Number XII p he says 'About the year Cormac O'Cuin the most  celebrated of our Irish monarchs had his authority renounced by the Ultonians the constant enemies of his family After defeating those rebels in se∣veral engagements their remains fled for shelter into the isles and continent of North Britain Supplied with an excellent militia disciplined un∣der the famous Fin Mac Cumhall his commander in chief and his soninlaw Cormac fol∣lowed his rebellious subjects into the places of their retreat The terror of his power brought matters to a speedy issue By consent or force he obtained from the Piks a settlement in Kintire and Argyle for his father's nephew Carbry Riada abovementioned Through that colonization un∣der his kinsman he left no foreign asylum open for his Ultonian enemies whose power in Ulster he also curtailed by stripping them of the territory now called the county of Antrim with some con∣tiguous districts well marked by Usher That territory as well as the other in North Britain had the name of Dalriada from Carbry Riada their first vassal sovereign under the Irish monarch who vested him with authority  Wynne in his history of Ireland London vols vo narrates the settlement of the Dalria  ls in Pikland in these terms "Among the sons of Olliol Olum there was one known by the distinguished name of Achy Ruada or Riada who was permitted by Olliol to raise a sufficient body of forces to establish himself in the province of Ulster Fer¦gus then king of that territory being of the family fa∣voured him and his followers who were of the race of De∣gad and by the assistance Achy Riada procured he soon settled himself in Ulster notwithstanding all the opposition of the Irians And from this circumstance the acquisition they made took the name of Dalriada or the portion of Riada But as Achy was one of those that having much still grasp at more observing a country overagainst his dis∣trict which appeared easy of access he embarked with his followers and either by force or treaty much more likely by the latter he obtained a settlement there also for his tribe from the British Picts And that tract of land was af∣terwards for many ages denominated the Albanian Dal∣rìada a name given to the inhabitants of Argyle who were descended from this Irish colony" Wynne errs grossly in making Riada son of Olliol Olum for he was son of Co∣nary II king of Ireland as all the above accounts bear And this is confirmed by an old piece published by Innes p "Fergus filius Eric ipse fuit primus qui de se∣mine Chonare" c  '  All this is given as usual without one autho∣rity or reference The circumstances of Mr O'Conor's tale are also discordant First he says the settlement was owing to force then he im∣putes it to treaty then to force again Dr Ken∣nedy's account tho brief seems much more ac∣curate and he imputes the settlement to the per∣mission of the Piks Common sense argues this to have been the case for that a handful of men to whom fortresses were unknown should force a settlement among so fierce and numerous a people as the Piks is impossible And even by Mr O'Conor's account when the Piks afterward quarreled with them they totally expelled the colony Mr O'Conor's story about the rebellion of the Cruthini or Piks in Ulster seems mere romance and we have no room to believe that these Cruthini acknowleged the Irish sovereignty or in other words that they could rebel Those Cruthini had only settled in Ulster about the year and far from being conquered or expelled on this occasion we find them under their own monarchs till the eighth or ninth century They were certainly not in Antrim but in present Lon∣donderry and Donegal For the Irish Dalreudini possessed Antrim by Mr O'Conor's own account and at the same time he allows that the Cruthini were in the north of Ireland and from Tighernac and the annals of Ulster c it is certain that the Cruthini were in a distinct region of Ireland from the Dalreudini That the Cruthini were not on the northeast of Ireland but the northwest also appears from Mr O'Conor's own information that  he found in the old book of Glendalogh that the Cruthini were in Ulster and Connaught which last province is on the west There is but one people of Cruthini in Ireland to be found in Adomnan Tighernac the annals of Ulster and other authentic documents and those Cruthini were in part of Ulster and part of Connaught by Mr O'Conor's own relation that is on the northwest of Ireland The people on the northeast of Ire∣land among whom Riada planted his Dalreudini were the Damnii or Darnii of Ptolemy a Cum∣raig people that had past from Scotland upon the arrival of the Piks The Dalreudini or tribe of Riada were certainly led by him from Mun∣ster his own province and must have been  Scythae  or  Scotti  who had subdued the south east and west of Ireland but had not extended into the north till Riada planted his colony From the genuine writings of St Patrick it is clear as Innes remarks that all the people of Ireland were not termed  Scotti  but that the Scots were the su∣perior and conquering people while the common subject race were termed merely  Hiberni  or Irish That the Dalreudini were Scots proper is certain from their being led from the South of Ireland the chief region of the Scots and from their be∣ing termed Scots peculiarly by Adomnan Beda and other ancients This account of the matter is so consonant to probability that it would al∣most support itself independent of all the ancient authorities which are united in its favour In∣deed i have always found that the highest proba∣bility and verisimilitude ever attend the ancient authorities when duly examined and collated  It may be thought that Kennedy and O'Conor writers of this century are but poor supports of Beda's authority But it must be reflected that concerning the origin of the Dalreudini of Ireland all the Irish writers Keating Usher O'Flaherty c c c are concordant and say the name  sprung from Carbry Riada Beda a superior authority to all the Irish annals put together in∣forms us that this very Riada led also the first co∣lony of Scots to North Britain So that the point stands clear independently of the lights which Kennedy and O'Conor throw upon it This Carbry or as others call him Eocha Riada ap∣pears in the old genealogy of the Scotish kings repeated at the coronation of Alexander III and preserved by Diceto Fordun and many others In that genealogy he is termed  Eodach Riede  and is placed twelve generations before Fergus son of Erc Kennedy informs us that tho the Scotish accounts thus put fourteen generations from Riada to Fergus including both yet the Irish and especially the book of Lecan give but ele∣ven that is nine generations between the two which at thirty years to a generation make years Mr O'Conor says but eight or years which is surely the truth Kennedy men∣tions an Irish MS which has but six and says that false names creep into such genealogies from mistaking nicknames for proper names and from putting names of predecessors as names of fathers and scruples not upon this occasion to shew discordances in scripture etymologies It is most strange that O'Flaherty in his genealogy of James II gives only  three  generations between Riada and Erc But that gentleman seems to have paid little attention to facts or authorities when his point was to abridge the antiquities of the British Scots and to appropriate to the Irish all the actions of the Scots against the Romans Which last purpose required no such aid as it is certain that the Irish Scots are those of Roman history and the British Scots were only known under another name of which presently But O'Flaherty deserves reproof for using falsifications tho to serve the cause of truth  Non tali auxilio  It is matter of regret that the acute and accu∣rate  Innes who also shews the first colony of Irish Scots in Britain to have settled in the third cen∣tury as here stated has not examined the gene∣rations between Riada and Erc for tho the lords of Dalriada were not kings till and it is not certain whether they dwelled in the Irish Dalri∣ada or the Pikish  In the time of Aidan the Irish Dalriada was divided from the British and reverted to the kings of Ireland  Ken∣nedy Vita Via Columbae apud Colgan  still they are the immediate ancestors of the Dalriadic or Old Scotish line I shall here put down this genealogy according to the ancient Scotish account and the Irish as given by Kennedy  The Scotish is  Eochad Riede  Fiachrach Tathmail    Eocha Andoth    Akirkir    Findach    Cruichlinch    Sencormac    Fethelmac Romach    Angusa Butim    Fethelmec Aslingret  Angusa Fir  Eocha Munremor  Erc  Fergus  The Irish follows  Eocha Riada    Kinta    Fedlim Lavedhoidhcuige  hand that burns a province  Fiachra Taithmail    Fergus Ulladh  Aengus Fear  Eocha Munremor  Erc  Fergus  Thus the Irish inserts two names between Eocha Riada and Fiachra not found in the Scotish and likewise a Fergus Ulladh not in the Scotish And the Scotish has eight names not in the Irish The four last names are alone con∣cordant So much for Irish genealogies It is remarkable that Angus Fir was cotemporary with St Patrick and that after him the genealogy seems accurate Before Patrick's time only the names of the kings of Ireland and great events can be received  Most writers on British antiquities have been puzzled to divine who the ATTACOTTI were and none has hitherto settled this point I am fully convinced that  Attacotti  was neither more nor less than the name given by the northern pro∣vincial Britains who were Cumraig to the Dal∣reudini From the  Dictionarium Kymbraicum  of Davis it appears that  At  is  ad Attal  is  retinere detinere  c So that there is reason to conclude that the name Attacotti means simply  Hither Scots  or  Scots remaining  in Britain The  S  is quite a servile letter sometimes superfluous sometimes omitted  euphoniae causa  as all the least verst in the struc∣ture of languages know But this opinion receives full confirmation from other reasons Ammianus Marcellinus first mentions the Attacotti at the year  Picti Saxonesque et Scotti et Atta∣cotti Britannos aerumnis vexavere continuis  And then at the year  Picti in duas gentes divisi Dicaledones et Vecturiones itidemque Attacotti belli∣cosa hominum natio et Scotti per diversa vagantes multa populabantur  And from St Jerome we learn  that the Attacotti were a nation of Britain Thus quite a new nation appears in Britain at this pe∣riod But how came it to escape the Roman writers for a whole century from till The wonder would it is presumed have been greater had this new colony appeared in Roman history sooner Horsley well observes that from the expedition of Severus till Carausius nothing concerning Britain can be found And from till what have we Only a hint or two of panegyrists dealing wholly in generals The first books of Ammianus are most unfortu∣nately lost so that from till we have really no writer from whom such information could be in the least expected either historian or geographer Ammianus at the year tells us he had given a description of Britain when describing the actions of Constans there about the year so shall add no more Then he proceeds to the sentence above quoted It is therefore to be inferred that as he says nothing at of the Attacotti being quite a new nation he had described them at and in all proba∣bility told us as we are still fully enabled to dis∣cover that they were a colony of the Scots who had come from Ireland and settled on the north of the Glota or Clyde But the knowlege we have that the colony calling themselves Dalreu∣dini came to Britain about and the mention of the Attacotti a new nation in North Britain only a century afterward will of itself convince us that Attacotti was neither more nor less than the name given by the provincial Britons to the Dalreudini  Richard of Cirencester a monk of the four∣teenth century who is often palpably erroneous is a writer to be cautiously used To Ptolemy's map of North Britain Richard has added the  Attacotti  and  Damnii Albani  nations unknown to Ptolemy but is certainly right in their posi∣tion  He places the Attacotti on the north of the Frith of Clyde and the Damnii Albani just above them And these two nations form the only addition he makes to Ptolemy's map Now Beda places the Dalreudini on their first arrival exactly in that very region  Est autem sinus ma∣ris permaximus qui antiquitus gentem Britonum a Pictis secernebat qui ab occidente in terras longo spatio erumpit ubi est civitas Britonum munitissima usque hodie quae vocatur Alcluith Ad cujus vide∣licet sinus partem septentrionalem Scotti quos diximus adven  entes sibi locum patriae fecerunt  This is surely a strong confirmation that the Dalreudini and Attacotti were one and the same nation The Damnii Albani of Richard were it is likely some of the Damnii of Antrim conquered by Riada whom he had transplanted here along with his co∣lony of Dalreudini Albani is a wellknown term for  North British  in the Irish tongue  The Attacotti make a distinguished figure in the  Notitia Imperii  a work of the fifth century where numerous bodies of them appear in the list of the Roman army One body was in Illyricum their ensign a kind of mullet another at Rome their badge a circle the  Attacotti Honoriani  were in Italy In the same work are named bodies of Parthians Sarmatae Arabs Franks Saxons c Those foreign soldiers had in all likelihood be∣longed to vanquished armies and been spared from carnage on condition of bearing arms in those of Rome Some it is likely were merely foreign levies and auxiliaries To which class those Attacotti belong it is difficult to say Cer∣tain it is that Theodosius in repelled the Piks Scots and Attacotti from the Roman provinces in Britain rebuilt the wall of Antoninus be∣tween Forth and Clyde and founded the pro∣vince of Valentia The Attacotti finding no employment for their arms might be tempted to enter into the Roman armies for it was the Ro∣man  policy in later ages to levy as many foreign troops as possible and to oppose barbarians to barbarians Perhaps the Attacotti were subdued and forced to furnish levies Perhaps these bo∣dies were prisoners of war  Some imagine that the present Highland dress represents the Roman military habit The  philibeg  was always quite unknown among the Welch and Irish but I know no Ro∣man name for it Among the Romans it was a mere orna∣ment or fringe to the mail and they wore  braccoe  or breeches under it From old illuminated MSS it appears to have been a dress of the people among the Saxons who could not afford breeches See Strutt's Antiquities I be∣lieve it also occurs on Trajan's pillar as the dress of the common Daci while the chiefs have  braccoe  Its antiquity among the Highlanders is very questionable and some sup∣pose it not older than Mary's reign Gildas represents both Piks and Scots of his time as quite naked with only a piece of cloth tied about their middie Giraldus Cambrensis mentions trousers as the Irish dress A D Froissard tho amazed at the  sauvages Ecozsons  as he calls them takes no notice of this striking peculiarity Plaids are used by the Wild Clans of Barbary Shaw's Travels Tartan is perhaps a late invention and it is believed passed from the Lowlands to the Highlands The Highland dress is not ancient but singular and adapted to their savage life    The time when the Attacottic colony arrived in Pikland was certainly that in which flourished the celebrated  Fion Mac Cumhal  pronounce Fin Mac Cuwal as all the Irish historians agree and therefore a few words shall be added concerning that hero who has had so singular a fate in our time In Scotland he is also called  Fingal  and is mentioned under that name by Barbour in but this name is unknown to the Irish That Fingal was the same person with the Irish Fin Mac Cuwal is clear from the identic name of the father  Cuwal  the son  Oisin  the grandson  Oskir  and from the old Scotish poets who sometimes call this personage  Fingal  sometimes  Fin Mac Coul  The names of his companions Gaul son of Morni c also coincide both in Irish and Highland tradition so that the identity of Fin Mac Cuwal and Fingal is demonstrative  But how the Scots alone came to term him Fin∣gal is not so easily shewn In the old Irish wri∣ters as Tighernac the Annals of Ulster c  Fingal  or  White Strangers  is a name uniformly given to the Danes and is not used till their ap∣pearance in as Duf Gal or Dugal  Black Strangers  is the peculiar name of the Norwegians Mr Thorkelin a learned native of Iceland in∣forms me that the old dress of the Norwegians and especially of the pirates and mariners was black as the Icelandic is at this day and has always been But the Danes seem to have been called Fingal from the whiteness of their com∣plexions while the Celts are of black complexion The name Fingal given to Fion seems therefore an impropriety and a confusion as tradition is synonymous with confusion of the fame of the Fingals or Danes in Ireland with that of Fin the hero The whole Irish and Highland poems and traditions concerning this personage form indeed one mass of confusion and absurdity  The period when Fin flourished has like other traditional matters suffered the grossest anachro∣nisms Later Irish MSS and traditions and poems both of Ireland and the Highlands re∣present his son Oisin or Ossian as he is new christened as cotemporary with St Patrick A D holding dialogues with that Saint writing poems to him c But the real epoch of Fin preceded Saint Patrick near two centuries as is clear from Irish history He flourished un∣der Cormac O'Cuin who ascended the Irish throne in as Mageogaghan Keating O'Flaherty Mac Curtin O'Halloran O'Conor Warner Wynne and other writers who mention Fin shew from the Irish annals Colonel Val∣lancey tells us that at the memorable battle of Gabhra A D between Moghchorb king of Munster and Cairbre son of Cormac king of Tara most of the standing army that had lately  been commanded by Fion Mac Cumbal and its re∣nowned heroes called Fiana Eirionn or Phenians were slain after vast carnage of the enemy O'Flaherty informs that Fin died in and under the year says  Praelium Gauranum prope Temoriam "In praelii aestu Carbreus et Osgarus Fin∣nii ex Ossino nepos manus conserunt  In the British Museum Cat Aysc is a fine MS of Mageoghagan's History of Ireland written in where at the year he says "Fynne Mac Coyle the great hun∣ter and defender of Ireland beheaded" He gives a long fabulous account of him and observes that "Osgar Mac Ossyn Fynn Mac Coyle's grandchild was a valourous and hardy man'  c That Fin and Oisin do not belong to Saint Patrick's time is indeed clear from Tighernac the Annals of Ulster and other authentic documents Jocelin in his life of Saint Patrick written in the twelfth century places  Finnan Mac Con  a giant above a hundred years before Patrick As to the ana∣chronisms which have crept in they are common in all traditions Fin and Patrick were the two most famous men of ancient Ireland and they are thus brought together Still greater anachro∣nisms appear in the Northern Sagas concerning Starkader the Fin or Arthur of Scandinavia Torfaeus in his Norwegian history has a disser∣tation  De Starkadis  and makes many out of one whom Saxo represents as living three centuries Nay Torfaeus says there is no age from Christ's birth to the eighth century free from synchro∣nisms of Starkader Torfaeus in the same work vol I p is forced to strive against the gross anachronism of a man whom he puts in the fifth century marrying Ragnar Lodbrog's daughter who lived in the ninth But such is tradition Suhm in his Abstract of Danish History makes two Starkaders one in the fifth the other in the eighth century both of them great warriors and great poets This resembles the three Odins  and is a mere apology for the anachronism of tra∣dition The mention of Starkader leads me to hint the great similarity between him and the Irish Fin and Oisin whence it is reasonable to infer that the Danes and Norwegians in Ireland and Scotland grafted many of the fables about Starkader on the story of Fin Oisin c Starka∣der like Ossian is not only an Achilles but a Homer not only a hero but a great poet As Fin and Oisin are equally celebrated in Ireland and the Highlands so Starkader both in Den∣mark and Sweden Starkader was famous for assisting the oppressed so Fin ideas evidently of the times of chivalry As Macpherson makes his Ossian an historian of grave note so Saxo repre∣sents Starkader Oisin celebrates his own actions so Starkader  Starkader annosus poeta erat et carmina ejus vetustissima censentur eorum quae jam homines memoria tenent  Verel Goth et Rolf Hist  Ramus in his  Nori Regnum  p gives two fragments of Starkader's poetry in which he says 'I was young when dreadful fires destroyed my father and other brave men' c a passage similar to one in Ossian A poem of Starkader on frugality may be found in Olaus Magnus V another on his battles V The reader is referred to Olaus for a long and curious account of this hero    Almost every nation has had a champion of this sort the Persians Rustan the Greeks Hercules the Scandinavians Starkader the Welch Arthur the Irish Fin the French Charlemagne c Of these the Welch Arthur is now known to be a nonexistence being only a Cumraig epithet  Ard ur  'The Great Man' for Aurelius Ambrosius their Roman leader against the Saxons And of the Irish Fin the less that is said in history the better and the Irish antiquaries act judiciously in this respect He seems however to have been a man of great talents for the age and of celebrity in arms His formation of a regular standing army trained to war in which all the Irish accounts agree seems  to have been a rude imitation of the Roman le∣gions in Britain The idea tho simple enough shews prudence for such a force alone could have copt with the Romans had they invaded Ireland But this machine which surprized a rude age and seems the basis of all Fin's fame like some other great schemes only lived in its author and expired soon after him  Buchanan in his account of the family of Buchanan Edin to gives an account of the Feans or militia of Fin and speaks of 'rude rhimes' on the actions of Fin Mac Coel their general as retained by the Irish and Scotish Highlanders This gentleman was well versed in the Gaelic language    Of the pretended poems of Ossian the son of this Fin it is almost beneath the purpose of this work to speak That so silly a delusion should impose even on some literati both of England and Scotland is only a proof how little historical antiquities are studied in Britain for in any other country only laughter could have followed As to us of Scotland foreigners seem on this occa∣sion justly to question whether we be yet savages or not For that the most civilized and benevo∣lent manners should belong to savage society as represented in Ossian is not so absurd as that such a delusion could impose on any in a country advanced beyond a savage state National preju∣dice is also a species of madness and consumes all reasoning and common sense so that people rather acute on other points will on this betray a credulity beneath childhood and an obduracy beyond the pitch of confirmed frenzy Certain it is that had these poems of Ossian been published by an Irishman all Scotland from the Mull of Galloway to the Orkneys would have been in one peal of laughter at so enormous a  bull  Yet it must be confessed that these poems form a literary phaenomenon the most singular that has ever appeared or will in all probability  ever appear in the world of literature Their general manner is such that it is no wonder they impose When very young and immerst in Greek and Roman reading i had a firm opinion of the falsehood of Ossian's poems because it appeared at first glance that their preservation was an impossible fiction This was before i had redd them but upon perusal my sentiments to∣tally changed The intrinsic style and manner and imagery of the poems with the translator's plausible notes and the testimonies given by Dr Blair a man of the most excellent moral charac∣ter made me a complete convert and from the age of sixteen till twenty their veracity appeared to me positive any objections to it the mere ef∣fect of envy or of national prejudice But be∣ginning at last to study the antiquities of modern nations and of my own country in particular i soon awakened from so gross a delusion and was apt to conclude them the mere fabrications of the translator from the total ignorance even of the greatest features of our history and manners that runs through the whole I am convinced there∣fore from my own experience that as soon as historical antiquities the most manly and import∣ant of all literary pursuits begin to be in the least studied in Britain the poems of Ossian will be regarded in their true light of mere romance But that they are totally the fabrications of the translator would be a rash conclusion and tho i was led to think so once in my abhorrence of be∣ing made a dupe yet upon full consideration of this point i am convinced that one half or per∣haps more of these poems is really traditional For the poem of Fingal is mentioned as preserved by tradition in the Highlands long before the translation appeared And Dr Blair produces about an hundred respectable witnesses to the tra∣dition of other poems and passages But this very tradition will to any impartial mind pre∣sent  a clear proof that the original parts are of a late age And it appears to me that some poet or poets of superlative genius flourished in the Highlands of Scotland in the Fourteenth or Fif∣teenth century  The learned Murray in the  Novi Commentarii Societatis Gettingensis  Gotting to laughs at Fingal and Te∣mora and thinks them productions of the XIIth or XIIIth century under an ancient name as Klopstock gave his  Bar∣ditus  And he shews tom III p that there was no  Lochlin  known in Scotland or Ireland till the th century so that Ossian must be a forgery  to whom we are indebted for the traditional parts For that they are not more ancient is clear from their being preserved by tradition  Were they more ancient far from being preserved by tradition the very language would be unknown to the vul∣gar mouth Evans in his Specimens of Welch Poetry p ii observes with great simplicity "The language of the Seotish oldest poets it seems is still perfectly intelligible which is by no means our case" No nor the case of any other nation  and from the total confusion of all history that pervades them The tales of Fin and his heroes were always famous among the Irish and their descendents the Scotish High∣landers as those of Arthur among the Welch Had a poet of superlative genius arisen in Wales at a late period we might have seen as fine poetry with a similar ignorance and perversion of all history Arthur would no doubt have fought in France Ireland c and have been always victor Had such a poet arisen in Bretagne Wales the real region of Arthur would have been re∣presented as the scene of his conquests as is the case with Ossian The French  lais  often place Arthur's court in Bretagne  But it is said that Ossian bears intrinsic marks of truth  Because Ossian always appears as the poet  Because there is no mention of Chris∣tianity  Because the manners are of genuine hue  The first of these arguments is nonsense The second foolish The third utterly false Had  Oisin son of Fin and father of Oskir composed any poetry this circumstance could never have escaped the whole Irish antiquaries Any one the least verst in the Gothic or other poetry of the middle ages must know that nothing was so usual as to compose poetry in the name of an eminent person Lodbrog's deathsong is one in∣stance of an hundred Ariosto quotes Turpin as his author and Cervantes has his Arabic autho∣rity Even in England so late as the end of the sixteenth century The Mirror of Magistrates is wholly of this kind This was a mere trick of the poet for greater effect and to command re∣verence As Homer and other poets put their poetry into the mouth of a muse so these bards used one or more eminent persons by way of a muse A poor Highland stroler however great his genius would never have commanded half so much attention to his own poetry as he must have done by imputing it all to the celebrated Oisin the son of Fin Literary forgery is by no means confined to enlightened periods but is on the contrary the proper fruit of a dark pe∣riod and of an ignorant country for in other periods and countries the light is too strong The night is the season of deception In the dark ages there was false Herodotus Phalaris Aesop c c c who all vanished when the light of literature arose The forgeries of monks poets c in the middle ages may be reckoned by thousands But in the present case as the translator has confessedly altered his copies at his pleasure there is room to believe that most of the passages concerning Oisin and his harp are of his own interpolation in order to appropriate the pieces to his title The Works of Ossian  Smith observes in his Gaelic Antiquities that 'Since the order of the bards has ceased almost all the ancient Gae∣lic poems are ascribed to Ossian' Let me add and all with equal justice  If this  translator would leave his Celtic hyperboles for a moment and descend from the stilts of his extra∣vagant impudence merely to inform the republic of letters in which the least are his equals few not his superiors what is traditional what interpo∣lated in these pieces it would be better for him As it is the manifest intention he shews to de∣ceive and his ignorant and impudent assertions will totally stifle all return from the public to his labours and render his posthumous fame less than nothing  That there is no mention of Christianity in these poems is a foolish argument By this argument few modern poets would belong to a Christian period Poetry has a machinery of its own in all countries I have seen Icelandic poetry writ∣ten last year in which the whole mythology of the Edda was kept up as it is indeed always fol∣lowed save in hymns alone by the Icelandic skalds Besides the Norwegians who seized the Hebudes and west of Scotland in the ninth cen∣tury were not Christians and their Celtic sub∣jects had no religion at all but became utterly ignorant But this question is also in the hands of the translator who has altered the poems put out Saint Patrick and put in Caracalla As the pieces are confessedly altered how reason with ac∣curacy upon such a fabrication Suffice it to say that  granting  there is no mention of Christianity in these poems any argument drawn from this would be as foolish as to infer that the produc∣tions of the Northern skalds were all written be∣fore Christianity  As to the manners in this Ossian they are false to excess as are the whole history geography and chronology  Lord Kames in his Sketches of the History of Man vol I has a long argument to prove the authenticity of Os∣sian He Dr Blair and one or two more really ingenious men as Mr Gray in England do honour to that side of the question But i beg leave to ask my reader if he would take the advice of these gentlemen in any medical case And are not they just as much physicians as they are antiquaries With want of knowlege of the Gaelic it is as ridiculous to charge the antagonists of Ossian as his defenders The later confessedly have no skill in the Gaelic but argue upon ar∣guments of foolish ingenuity The question is indeed of mere learning in antiquities and freedom of mind Lord Kames argues that the manners of Ossian belong to the hunting state the earliest of society and that no late poet of the XVth century could have forged such manners What forgery of manners Were not the highlands in a hunting state of society even in the XVIth century The little or no mention of cattle in Ossian only shews the author's ignorance for Dio tells us that the Caledonians drove cattle and sheep in the way of the army of Severus in order to draw parties into ambuscades But how argue upon pieces all altered by a modern translator Could any critic in any age reason accurately upon such a work from intrinsic proofs The noted mythology of Ossian is in fact Norwegian Odin in his magic st mentions the shades of the dead flying over the trees  Runa Cap apud Haavamal Resenii  Is it not a plain fact that not even a short poem ever was pre∣served by tradition for more than three centuries not a bal∣lad how then preserve long and numerous pieces for four∣teen centuries Is it not a plain fact that the language of every country becomes obsolete thro time even to the learned how then can Gaelic of the third century be pre∣served in the popular mouth Is it not a plain fact that Scot∣land has no privileges from heaven above other countries and that he must be the dupe of his prejudices who can suppose that the nature of human affairs is altered in Scot∣land alone Lord Kames observes 'One may venture boldly to affirm that such a poem as Fingal or Temora never was composed in any other part of the world under such disadvantageous circumstances' Hear the philosopher Is Scotland in the world or not  To dwell at length upon this  would be foreign to my purpose Fin an Irish general is metamorphosed into a king of Scot∣land as Arthur from a Roman general became in Welch tradition king of Britain To see Mr Macpherson who betrays such irrational preju∣dices against the Irish furbishing up the refuse of their fables and insisting upon making one of their generals king of Scotland is one of the most risible prospects in the scene of human madness  But ignorance is a strange affair The very name of Lochlin was unknown in Ireland or the High∣lands till the ninth century when the invasions of the Scandinavians began The name means  pirates  and Mr M puts it as a name of Scandi∣navia The name Fingal was never given to Fin by the Irish or Highlanders It was only applied to him by the Lowland Scots and perhaps means Fin the Gaël or Fin the Irishman by eminence The actions of Cuchullin who lived in the first century are blended in truly Celtic confusion with those of Fin in the third and of the Fingal and Lochlin in the ninth and tenth Moylena in the King's County is placed in Ulster as is Temora which is in Meath The last error de∣stroys a whole poem that of Temora in Eight Books which i am convinced is wholly Mr Mac∣pherson's own save parts of the first book which he at first published separately The car of Cuchul∣lin has been regarded as a mark of ancient man∣ners But the Norwegians used cars in the ninth century at the siege of Paris and they are believed to have been used by them in Ireland as in Scandinavia down to the eleventh century That they were used by the Crutheni or Piks in Ire∣land in the sixth century we know from Adom∣nan But from the old tales an Highland poet of the fifteenth century might easily have de∣scribed a car as modern poets describe gonfanons mail and other ancient but well known features of war Arguments as to the age of poetry from such descriptions are beneath puerility The want of  costume  in these poems is gross The manners of chivalry gallantry to the women and relieving the oppressed fill every page of Ossian and Fin like king Arthur is a perfect knight errant seven centuries before knighter∣rantry was invented To knighterrantry belong also the  halls  and  towers  while in Ossian's time there were only palaces built with wattles and  all on one floor in Ireland The  mail  also or  steel  habergeon perpetually mentioned in Ossian shews the ignorance of those who fight for his an∣tiquity for Herodian expressly tells us that the people of Caledonia wore no mail and hardly cloaths Mail of complete steel in Caledonia  Aegri insomnia  Brass alone was used among the barbaric nations to a late period and only for swords Nay the shields in Ossian are not of lea∣ther but of  bellmetal  else how could each of seven bosses yield a different sound as a signal Why should i  be condemned to follow such sickly idiotism How comes Ossian to omit boars and wolves so frequent in Scotland down to the fifreenth century in all his imagery In the battle of Lora we find an  arrow of gold  and a simple chief offers an hundred steeds an hundred maids an hundred hawks The standard of Fingal was called the sunbeam because studded with stones and gold The only barbaric ensigns were the heads of beasts In Carthon a thousand lights from the stranger's land are placed in the hall of Selma which the learned translator thinks may be  waxcandles  from the  Roman Province  The stars on the shield of Cathmor Temora b VII to what a strange understanding must they have occurred The single ship invented by Lumon with which he effects a settlement in Ireland Suffice it to say that considering Ossian as a historic poet no arguments need be used against him They who look upon him in that view must be too ignorant to understand argu∣ment How ridiculous would it be to use argu∣ments against Geofrey of Monmouth or the Psalter of Cashel This Ossian however as the frenzy of the translator has pushed him into this odd point of view may be safely regarded as the last effort of Celticism to injure the history of Britain Geofrey and the Psalter Cashel the Welch and Irish fables are lost in oblivion The  Highland Celts alone remained and for the first time thrusting their noses into the world of letters they have from the darkness of their own minds judged of an enlightened age For how can an ignorant and absurd mind conceive the light and accuracy of science or have any idea of the dan∣ger of insulting it Alas  they know no better  To their misty understandings tradition's silliest tales and the dreams of the darkest night of ig∣norance altered at pleasure by the prejudiced imaginations of modern writers strangers to all principles of common science or common literary integrity assume the sacred shape of  history  In∣stead of arguing against such infatuation pecu∣liar to a second sighted people of disordered senses we can only express the deepest regret at such a prospect of mental misery at such cala∣mitous depravation of the name of man  So much for Ossian as a historic poet As a romantic poet or a mere poet it is doubtful whether his faults or merits are greatest for both are extreme The faults of a total confusion of history chronology and geography are radical and run thro the whole The verisimilitude so necessary to please the mind is quite wanting  A late French critic says "On voit dans les anciens poetes Ecossois qu' Ossian prenoit sa harpe et chanto  t fur le champ le triomphe on la mort glorieuse d'un guerrier aussi malgrê l'art du traducteur je n'ai pu lire sans degout les ouvrages de cet improvisateur barbare C  est le galama∣thias d'un energumene je n'y vois rien de vrai et  Rien ne plait que le vrai le vrai seul est aimable  " The want not only of truth but of verisimilitude indeed eternally disgusts in every page of Ossian  The poems ought also to have been dedicated to Death for there is a death in almost every page eternally the same A vein of modern sentimental poetry and late fiction also very frequently peeps out from the cobweb covering Half would have been more than the whole Eternal epi∣sodes eternal ladies in mail where no mail was known sicken one at every turn The machi∣nery  imagery and phraseology are questionless fine and some passages superlative The phra∣seology is indeed often perfectly scriptural be∣cause the translator was at first  Reverend  In the third edition the parallel passages of scripture are marked in the notes To prophecy concerning the future reputation of these poems of Ossian would puzzle the most acute and enlightened critic On the one hand the pieces with great defects have also great and original merit On the other there is a total confusion of all his∣tory chronology and geography and  costume  a radical and ruinous defect unknown in any poetry that has hitherto found continual applause and indeed affording a disgust  sufficient to obli∣terate all pleasure in perusing so ignorant and in∣sane a mass of fiction How far this defect joined with the imposture which pervades the translation and which the public will soon recoil from with contempt and abhorrence may crush and obliviate what merit however high the poems may possess must be left to the judgment of posterity  CHAPTER III  The second arrival of the Ancient Scots in Britain and first establishment of the Dalriadic Kingdom in    THE Dalreudini or Attacotti were as has been hinted in the former chapter repelled to Ireland in the middle of the fifth century or about years after their arrival This event preserved in Irish history also appears from the Scotish accounts of Fordun Major Boyce Bu∣chanan c who all allow that the Scots were driven to Ireland and after a retreat of about fifty years were restored by Fergus son of Erc Gildas also strongly implies this so that this in∣cident may be regarded as fixt and universally allowed But its precise epoch and circumstances deserve consideration  Gildas after mentioning the letters of the Bri∣tons to Aëtius consul for the third time that is in tells us that the Britons instigated by despair obtained a victory over the marauding Piks and Scots That the Piks then remained quiet for a season but the Irish returned home not long after to return  revertuntur ergo impu∣dentes grassatores Hiberni domum post non multum temporis reversuri  The he mentions the plague which in pervaded Europe and the arrival of the Iutes in Kent Thus the date assigned by Gildas is But as his authority only af∣fords a strong implication it remains to confirm it by the Irish and Scotish accounts  The Irish account as above stated bears that it was in the time of their leader Eochad Munre∣var father of Erc father of Loarn and Fergus who in reestablished the Old Scots that their retreat took place That is two genera∣tions before or about years which brings us to But as in such cases the generations cannot afford the precise number the Irish ac∣count confirms the date given by Gildas of  As to the Scotish account it is so perverted by the forgeries of Fordun who places the expulsion of the Scots in and their reestablishment by Erc's sons in that all that can be argued from it is the duration of the expulsion which by this calculation is years He also quotes some old verses which give this number Of later Scotish historians some enlarge this number some diminish it But sufficient traces remain in our old writers to shew the tradition of the ex∣pulsion and that it lasted forty or fifty or more years  The epoch of this reestablishment is so marked and clear that no part of ancient history can well be more certain The period when Erc and his sons flourished nay the year of the progress of the later to Pikland and foundation of the Dal∣riadic kingdom will to any one the least versed in Irish history or our own old chronicles illus∣trated by Innes be as openly evinced as any date of Greek or Roman history Nor is this circum∣stance to be wondered at when the importance and lateness of the event are considered Mait∣land and some other weak and ignorant writers persist in spite of all truth learning and com∣mon sense to fix the reign of Fergus son of Erc at for two reasons Because the Roman transactions against the Piks and Scots cease about this time and this date affords therefore a  convenient  chain of history Because this date makes the Scotish kingdom more ancient than  those of Spain France England nay Ireland which Maitland begins at Leogaire the first Christian king Thus the date is very con∣venient and what is truth to a Scotish antiquist who in the darkness of ignorance cannot even form an idea what the light of science is Yet A D or years before Christ if you will would be as proper a date for Erc's sons and the establishment of the Dalriadic king∣dom as What would we say of a writer who to serve a foolish hypothesis should antedate the reign of any prince in Greek or Roman his∣tory a full century The case is as absurd here for after the Christian period of Irish history the events are as clear and positive being so late as those of any ancient history whatever  Erc the son of Eochad Munrevar is well known in Irish history and flourished toward the end of the fifth century He died in Usher has long ago told us what so many Irish writers have since repeated that Tighernac one of the most solid of the Irish annalists and who wrote about says that Fergus son of Erc with the race Dalriada held a part of Britain and died there This event he puts in the first year of the pontificate of Symmachus or  Tighernac's chronology is often wrong by five years as the reader has seen in the former part and will see in the course of this work  The author of the synchronisms also quoted by Usher puts this event twenty years after the battle of Ocha where Ailil Molt king of Ireland fell A D that is in  Two questions arise upon this subject Whe∣ther the date given by Tighernac or put by the author of the synchronisms should be preferred If Loarn or Fergus his younger bro∣ther was the first king of Dalriada  The first question is of small importance in an event of this nature the difference being only five years The author of the synchronisms is by Mr O'Conor called Flan of Bute and placed in the tenth century The learned Usher calls him  non novitius autor  'no late author' The question therefore lies between him and Tighernac The author of the synchronisms by such extracts as are given of his work appears a writer of consi∣derable learning and accuracy who studiously en∣deavoured to settle the chronology of his country by synchronisms of Roman emperors c And the date given by him is confirmed as Innes shews by the number of years assigned in the old Scotish chronicles to the kings from Fer∣gus to the death of Aidan which by all accounts was in namely Fergus Dongard Con∣gal Gabran Conal Aidan making just years which subtracted from leave the date of the commencement of the Dalriadic kingdom This certainly turns the scale in favour of the synchronisms Mageoghagan Usher O'Flaherty Kennedy Innes O'Conor all assent to this date of As to the date supposed to be put by Tighernac it seems doubt∣ful if so meant by the author or if he in other words marks precisely the first year of Symma∣chus For his dates are sometimes wrong by four or five years and Usher who in his  Antiquitates Eccl Brit  says that Tighernac mentions the first Symmachus in another place says that he only puts this event  sub initium pontificatus Symmachi  Symmachus sat from till or sixteen years and the year would be toward the beginning of his pontificate If strictly interpreted Tigher∣nac would place the death of Fergus in the same year with his colony for the words  et ibi mortuus est  would in regular annals imply this But as it is well known that this was not the case it may well be argued that Tighernac puts the date of  this event not to the precise first year of Symma∣chus but toward the beginning of his pontificate and is toward the beginning of it as it lasted from till  Let us now consider the second question or that concerning Loarn In the Scotish accounts of Dalriadic kings Fergus begins the series and Loarn is past in oblivion but in the Irish Loarn ranks as the first king Innes who was afraid of offending his bigotted countrymen and who pal∣pably trembles when asserting plain truth and au∣thority against ignorant prejudice and falsehood passes Loarn in utter silence as he has past the evidence for the retreat of the Scots from Al∣bany to Ireland in the fifth century Strange that he should affront us so far as to think that questions of plain matter of fact and mere ma∣thematical pleasure in other countries should in Scotish antiquities exclusively be regarded as sacred to bigotry and frenzy To him who looks on such questions with a due eye they are points of mere curiosity and of no more concern or pre∣judice than if they related to the history of Egypt Macedon China or Peru Nevertheless let us beware of that common error of flying from one prejudice to another and examine fairly whether Loarn or Fergus was really first king of Dal∣riada  The silence of the old Scotish lists upon this point is not to be wondered at for they are to∣tally erroneous and defective in other respects as sh  ll presently be shewn when we come to the chapter of Dalriadic kings Those petty princes were little regarded even in their own domain their future fabulous fortunes were unknown The Pikish monarchs were the kings of Scotland and as such attracted all notice The petty sovereigns of Argyle and Loarn were of such small account that the only wonder is that any tolerable list of them is preserved at all We have however no equal  list of any provincial kings in Ireland an ad∣vantage which their detached situation afforded But the Scotish lists are after all right that Fer∣gus was first king of ALL Dalriada for Loarn was only king of a part while Fergus held the other and succeeding his brother first ruled the whole  The Irish accounts bear that Loarn Angus and Fergus three sons of Erc led the Scots back to Britain in That Loarn was the first king and was succeeded by Fergus What became of Angus we are not told It would seem that either from incapacity or preference of private life he aspired not to any share of the power of his brothers But tho Loarn be left out of the regal list in the Scotish accounts yet neither he nor Angus are unknown in them Fordun lib III cap says that Fergus son of Erc came to Scotland  cum duobus fratribus Loarn et Tenegus  'with his two brothers Loarn and Tene∣gus' which last word is a not uncommon corrup∣tion of Angus with Fordun The register of the priory of St Andrew's written about also says of Kenneth son of Alpin  sepultus in Yona in∣sula ubi tres filii Erc scilicet Fergus Loarn et Enegus sepulti fuerant  'he was buried in Hyona where the three sons of Erc namely Fergus Loarn and Enegus were buried' And the Gae∣lic poem of Malcom the Third's time puts Loarn as the first king Indeed we learn from Jocelin a writer of the twelfth century and who compiled his life of St Patrick from more ancient authors that Fergus was the  youngest  son of Erc so that the arrangement ought infallibly to be Loarn Angus and Fergus  As to the Irish accounts it is now perfectly known from the works of O'Flaherty Kennedy O'Conor c that they put Loarn as first king of Dalriada and the Gaelic poem of Malcom the Third's time and supposed to be written by the courtbard as it is the most ancient monument of  Dalriadic history remaining deserves the greatest credit in this as in other points The Highland Scots are allowed by their own late writers to have been an illiterate people The celebrated monas∣tery of Hyona was supplied from Ireland which it always regarded as it's own parent country and being detached from Dalriada had no effect on the character of the Highlanders Ireland was on the contrary much noted for such learn∣ing as was then in vogue So that it is from the Irish writers that we must expect genuine memo∣rials of the Dalriadic kingdom and the proxi∣mity and identity of the Old British and Irish Scots and constant intercourse between them lend these memorials every degree of authenticity and cre∣dit In any other history such testimonials would bear no doubt and it would be a mark of deplo∣rable prejudice to weigh the history of Scotland in any other scales than those used in that of any other country whatever The early history of all barbaric states can only be gathered from writers of neighbouring nations and the future authors of these barbaric countries have uniformly assented to these foreign accounts nor has any one ever attempted save in Scotland alone to overturn foreign authorities by no authority at all Setting aside Greek and Roman authorities where would be all the ancient history of Europe Asia and Africa The testimony of Irish writers is not equal to that of Greek and Roman but is certainly more than sufficient for the early history of Dalriada a petty Irish colony  But in the present case it so happens that there is no occasion for dispute for the Irish and Scotish accounts are most easily reconciled Late Irish authors doubtless err in supposing Loarn first SOLE king of Dalriada He and Fergus were in every appearance joined kings or rulers of sepa∣rate parts the former of Lorn which as usual with Irish countries retains his name the later  of Argyle Loarn of the northern part of Dalriada Fergus of the southern Upon the death of Loarn without heirs male  Perhaps Loarn left sons tho not come to maturity and Fergus seized the occasion of fixing the kingdom in his own family The descendants of Loarn sometimes held the Dal∣riadic sceptre as shewn chap V  Fergus acceded to his share and was thus in fact first king of Dalriada This plain account which reconciles all authorities recommends itself by it's simplicity The reason why Loarn is omitted in the Scotish lists and ge∣nealogists thus appears at once From Tigher∣nach it is clear that Fergus led a great part of the Dalriads to Britain and that ancient writer does not even mention Loarn Hence it appears that Fergus was a chief leader of this colony and it is not probable that he would have yielded to the sole sovereignty of his brother who had done no more in the matter than himself Thus even the Irish authorities concur to establish this account Loarn and Fergus were both advanced in life when they proceeded to Britain  CHAPTER IV  Extent of the Kingdom of Dalriada  THE Dalreudini or Attacotti as above shewn were seated on the northwest side of the Frith of Clyde or in the south of present Argyle∣shire From the figure which they make in his∣tory and in the  Notitia  it is clear that they must have been considerably numerous At the smallest computation not less than ten thousand effective men could infer the notice they attract and sup∣posing one man from each family and each fa∣mily to be of four persons their population would thus amount to or Nor can more be granted from our knowlege of the territory they held and from their being only denominated a  Dal  or  Tribe  under one leader Reuda and his successors  But on their return under Loarn and Fergus in their number seems to have doubled that account The former leader had the north part of present Argyleshire now called Lorn from his name The  Epidii  are the only Caledonian Pikish or Gothic people placed in all this tract by Pto∣lemy and they were in Cantire and the ile of  Epidion  or Jura and Ila The ile of Mull was also retained by the Piks for in Hyona which is on the south of Mull was given by the Pikish monarch to Columba The name Cantire is Gothic but may have been given by the Nor∣wegians on their seizing the Hebudes about the year When this tract was ceded to the Dal∣riads such of the Epidii as chused to remain it  may be inferred had that privilege but were soon lost in the new language of the colony  Certain it is from all the ancient testimonies that the kingdom of Dalriada in the whole period of it's duration or from till did not ex∣ceed the limits of present Argyleshire This small territory is mountainous and barren and it was no great gift to yield it to a colony of Scots the old allies of the Piks The ile of Mull which fronts it's northern corner and is flat fertile and populous the Piks retained and it was alone worth all the rest In treating of the extent of the Pikish dominions the limits of Dalriada have been mentioned and need not be here repeated An ancient writer says Fergus ruled the tract from Drum Albin to the Irish sea and Hebudes Drum Albin is the highest part of Braidalbin on the east of Argyleshire and it is clear from Adomnan that it was the eastern boundary of Dalriada or the Old Scotish kingdom in Britain The Frith of Clyde is well known to have been the southern and the Irish sea the western The northern boundary is not so positive Innes has not sufficiently illustrated this point Winton considers old Argyle as the whole of the Dalria∣dic kingdom  So our old chronicles published by Innes  Primus in Ergadia Fergus rexit tribus annis  and of Kenneth 'Hic mira calliditate duxit Scotos de Ar∣gadia in terram Pictorum'  for speaking of Kenneth the fabled conqueror of the Piks he says  Out of ARGYLE he brocht the Scottis  And put thame quhair that the Pychtis  Had befoir tham maid duelling  And thair gart tham be and he thair king  Book  VI  ch    But it appears that Loch Linny was the northern boundary of Dalriada For Mull remained to the  Piks  Walafrid Strabo who wrote in the ninth century puts Hyona as on the confines of the Piks  Insula Pictorum quaedam monstratur in oris  Fluctivago suspensa salo cognominis Eo  This passage is in his life of St Blaithmac who was slain in Hyona by the Norwegians  apud Canis Lect Ant  tom vi  The kingdom of Dalriada certainly never extended over the Hebudes as our old chronicles alone might evince for they mark it as reaching from Drum Alban or BrunAlban  Brun pectus collis  Old Germ Gr  Wachter on the east  usque ad mare Hiberniae et ad InchGall  on the west It no more included InchGall or the Hebudes than it did the Irish sea it reached  ad  not  supra  and it is not to be conceived that it was detached from their other dominions but on the contrary must have adjoined to them So that Morven and the rest of that part of present Argyleshire which lies north of Loch Linny was in every appearance possest by the Piks as was the rest of the north of Scotland The name  LochAber  given to the northeast part of Argyle implies i am told  The Lake of Strangers  and seems to mark a limit but on this nothing can be founded  In the German language  Haber  is  corn  in Scandinavian  Hasrar avenae Haberdun  the Saxon name of a place in Bed∣fordshire means  Oatlands  Archaeol VIII The Piks were an agricultural people the Dalriads not so perhaps this may afford an argument tho a trifling one  It is to be regreted that those an∣cient pieces which mark Drum Alban and the Irish sea as the eastern and western bounds of Albany did not also affix the northern bound for as to the southern it is perfectly known to have been the Frith of Clyde But to any one who casts an eye upon the map of Scotland Loch Linny will appear the only grand boundary which could be assigned on the north of the Dal∣riadic territory and it is connected with other lakes which intersect the country to Inverness This was the limit of Vespasiana and is now marked with a chain of forts William Augus∣tus and George Beyond this on the northwest  of Scotland there are only small creeks and crowded hills which afford no grand natural boundary The old description of Scotland sup∣posed to be by Giraldus Cambrensis and Win∣ton with other ancient accounts unanimously mark Argyle as the Dalriadic kingdom The Piks certainly held Hyona and of course Mull and the adjacent northern coast For all these reasons it seems certain that Loch Linny was the grand and natural boundary of Dalriada on the north  The charter of the earldom of Moray published by Home Lord Kaims in his Essays on British Antiquities and in Shaw's Moray throws some light on the old limits of Argyle This great earldom or province of Moray included present Elginshire Nairnshire and Invernessshire ex∣tending on the north in the words of the Charter  per mare usque ad marchias boreales Ergadiae quae est comitis de Ros  Glenelg or that part of Invernessshire which borders on Ross on the West being in∣cluded in Moray Thus it would seem that in the fourteenth century Argyle extended even to Rossshire Yet in Gordon of Straloch's maps Argyle is restricted to the south of Lorn and of Loch Aw From the  Descriptio Albaniae  pub∣lished by Innes it also appears that in the th century  Argathelia  was regarded as a large pro∣vince But this impropriety arose after the Nor∣wegians settled in the north and west of Scot∣land in the ninth century and it is clear from Tighernac and other early writers that Lorn was a distinct province from Argyle and the later was on the south of it as Gordon of Stra∣loch's maps rightly bear From the  Descriptio Albaniae  it appears that  Argathelia  was all the country held by the Gatheli Gael or Irish and thus seems different from the  Argal  of Tigher∣nac But both being translated Argyle confusion arose There is however no proof that the Gael  extended up to Ross shire before the Norwegians seized on the Hebudes so that the limits of Dal∣riada  This name of Dalriada continued to the time of Kenneth son of Alpin at least as appears from the old chronicle Innes App No III p which speaking of that king says "Iste vero biennio antequam veniret Pictaviam DAL∣RIETAE regnum suscepit"  have nothing to do with those of Arga∣thelia  CHAPTER V  Catalogue of the Dalriadic Kings  IT is surprizing that Innes who has published the genuine old lists of the kings in North Britain as preserved in Scotish manuscripts has given us no chronologic remarks on the dates of their respective reigns The Pikish series he has arranged but has left the Dalriadic not seem∣ing even to suspect the difficulties attending it or perhaps afraid of offending weak brethren by shewing it's inaccuracy The Dalriadic series as digested by O'Flaherty with some care and fide∣lity from the oldest monument on the subject the poem ascribed to Malcom the Third's bard and supported by the Annals of Ulster Tighernac and others of the most veracious Irish testimonies Innes has past in total silence Yet the Scotish lists compared with that of O'Flaherty are most inaccurate and liable to strong objections And it is in fact from Ireland alone that we are to look for genuine intelligence on this trifling subject of the Dalriadic kings as above shewn But when we find this intelligence resting on the oldest Scotish monument the poem of Malcom's time it is rash to oppose it and to pass it in silence as Innes has done is still worse Indeed when Innes wrote much of the old leaven of fabulous frenzy and childish prejudice remained in Scot∣land and it is no wonder that he shunned telling us that our own lists of our dear kings of Argyle are inaccurate and that the Irish accounts are far superior But as every reader must already have seen that the Pikish series is that of the kings of  Scotland down to at least if not after this line of Dalriadic princes becomes of no more importance than that of so many Dukes of Ar∣gyle Such being the case and philosophy mak∣ing daily progress in Scotland it is presumed little or no bigotry remains on this subject and it is hoped that every sensible reader will approve my treating it with perfect freedom as i can safely say that my earnest wish is to despise all prejudice and timidity while asserting the cause of truth which is that of my country for falshood is the greatest dishonour that any country or indivi∣dual can undergo  The succession of Dalriadic kings extends from till when Kenneth ascended the Pik∣ish throne For this period of years the old Latin lists assign twentyfour kings including Kenneth The Albanic Duan gives thirtyfour So that the difference amounts to no less than TEN kings  It has been mentioned above when treating of the Pikish succession that from the lists of Irish monarchs and of the Pikish and of the heptarchic kings in England not more than eleven years each fall to any series of barbaric monarchs in the north of Europe Sir Isaac Newton has shewn that eighteen years form the medium in great and civilized kingdoms but in small barbaric kingdoms it is clear from facts as well as philo∣sophy that the succession is above onethird more rapid and eleven years form the medium  Mr Gibbon observes vol V p to ed that in the Byzantine empire emperors fill years a proportion he adds far below Newton's rule  Now kings at years each give but years instead of And it is perfectly known that the Dalriadic kings were engaged in constant wars and dissentions above any either in Britain or Ireland so that instead of granting them longer reigns than the neighbouring princes it is  but fair to assign them rather shorter If we put them therefore at ten years apiece the reigns of thirtyfour kings will just fill years or an∣swer the Albanic account Kenneth's reign also extended more than a dozen of years beyond so that kings seem necessary upon general chronologic principles to fill the space of time But kings for more than years would give about years apiece and form a striking and absurd exception to the Irish Pikish and Hep∣tarchic lists This argument becomes so cogent as to be invincible when we consider that by all accounts the clear and certain list from Kenneth's accession to the Pikish throne till the death of Lulach contains no less than eighteen kings in years Which is but between eleven and twelve years for each king If this was the case when the dissentions of the Piks and Dal∣riads being at an end one grand cause of the shortness of the Dalriadic reigns had ceased and the kings possessed ample power and security it is surely reasonable to infer that the reigns pre∣ceding that date must have been shorter instead of so much longer as to amount to years at a medium  But over and above this plea deduced from the soundest rules and philosophy of chronology the preference due to the Gaelic list is clear be∣cause that list corresponds with dates preserved in authentic Irish Annals and is in itself sufficiently exact while the Latin lists are totally absurd  See them in Innes's Appendix  Till the death of Aidan or for the first cen∣tury both answer as to names of kings com∣mencement of the monarchy in and death of Aidan in But from till the confusion and inaccuracy of the Latin lists are selfapparent They bear the following kings and number of years each reigned  Eochod years Began to reign  Kinat Keir months  Fercar years  Donal Brec years  Malduin years  Fercar Fada years  Eochoid Rinneval years  Armkelleth year  Edgan years  The Chronicle of Melrose begins where Beda ends and gives these kings after Edgan as above only dating Ed∣gan's death But they are inserted in the margin by an Abbot of Dundraynan as the original MS in the Cotton lib bears  mutuavit abbas de Dundraynan  and in the thirteenth cen∣tury as the writing shews being copied from our old lists and with very faulty chronology as l  nes remarks p    Murdac years  Eogan years  Ed Fin years  Fergus years  Selvac years  Eochoid years  Dungal years  Alpin years  Kenneth  Winton follows this series as to names of kings but omits often the years they reigned and puts the years of Christ at his pleasure Fordun that weak and insamous falsificator and forger of our history was the first who presented us with ano∣ther series of all our old Dalriadic kings which to the disgrace of our learning and sagacity has been blindly followed by Major Boyce Lesly Buchanan nay to this day by Maitland Guthrie and the other dablers in our history That falsi∣fied list from the death of Aidan till Ken∣neth's accession to the Pikish throne stands thus  Kennethus Keir months  Eugenius III years  Ferquardus I years  Donaldus III years  Ferquardus II years  Malduinus years  Eugenius IV years  Eugenius V years  Amberkelethus year  Eugenius VI years  Murdacus years  Etfinus years  Eugenius VII years  Fergus II years  Selvathius years  Achaius years  Convallus years  Dungalus years  Alpinus years  Kennethus  Innes has sufficiently shewn the perversions and interpolations of the former part of this mock list and this later part has also it's share Connad Keir is placed before Eochoid or Euge∣nius as falsely translated in direct perversion of the old lists which Fordun had before his eyes and of the testimony of Adomnan who lived in that very century and tell us in express terms that Eochoid succeeded Aidan Tighernac also clearly marks the reign of Connad Keir to have followed that of Eochoid as shall be afterward stated in his own words Fercar II Fada is also put before Malduin in defiance of the old lists both Irish and Scotish Eochod is again falsely translated Eugenius and a false Euge∣nius V is interpolated equally unknown both to the Irish and Scotish accounts Ed Fin is placed before Eogan against the same authentic cata∣logues And a false Convallus is interpolated  The cause of interpolating kings is selfapparent namely to swell the list and bring it into some conformity with chronology and Fordun's power of creating kings is too well known But what purpose that ignorant dreamer had in view by merely altering positions of kings and putting the last first is not so easily seen This flaw seems indeed to have sprung merely from an ex∣traordinary talent for blundering or to shew us that our history was all his own and he would use it as he pleased But as he was strong he should have been merciful and not have in∣sulted us by such a display of power only equalled in the Rehearsal  And all this I shall do because I dare  The falsehood of Fordun's list is also clear from it's chronology Connad Keir died in as Tig∣hernac says Fordun places his death in Amkellach was slain in according to the Irish annals Fordun puts Selvac is often mentioned in these annals at c Fordun dates him These glaring faults perversions and interpolations render his authority as un∣tenable in this part as Innes has shewn it to be in the former and the character of Fordun now so well known as a gross forger and falsificator sets the due seal to his evidence He had palpa∣bly never seen the Albanic Duan nor the Irish accounts All he does is to alter and interpolate the old Latin lists preserved in the Register of St Andrew's and other repositories and pub∣lished by Innes  Fordun's list followed by all our writers to this day is indeed the utmost perfection of histo∣rical falsehood for it is a falsification of the old Latin lists which are themselves false It is a superfetation of falsehood falsehood again fal∣sified For the defects of the old Latin lists are so great as to stamp them with utter falsehood on the whole chronology in gross as above shewn  Their particular chronology is no less erroneous Connad Keir died in the lists put Amkellach died the lists say Selvac began to reign the lists date Murdac began his reign the lists say And the wellknown reign of Kenneth who ascended the Pikish throne is antedated by these old lists near thirty year  Fordun's list blindly followed by Major Boyce Lesly Buchanan and to our own times by Maitland Guthrie and other dablers in our history being so totally false and erroneous as to be out of the question the only point that re∣mained was whether the Latin or Gaelic list de∣served preference The Pikish series in the essen∣tial parts of which as might be expected from it's importance all Irish Scotish and English accounts agree as formerly shewn is that of the kings of Scotland till The Dalriadic series of kings of Argyle was so unimportant that it is surprizing that any tolerable list is extant In fact the whole series stands upon one poem which is now printed in the Appendix from a transcript remitted to me by Mr O'Conor This poem bears in its conclusion that it was written in the time of Malcom III  The original of this piece is supposed to be in the Psaltar Cashail It is quoted by Ward in  Vita Rum  ldi  p Colgan in his  Trias Thaumaturga  p published some distichs of it See an account of it and translation of part in O'Flaberty's Ogygia Vindicated p Kennedy p erroncously says it rehearses all the Pikish kings  It is beyond question the most antient monument of Dalriadic history extant and has been long since quoted as such by Colgan Ward and others O'Flaherty rightly drew the whole series from it and he and others most skilled in the Irish lan∣guage have ever regarded it's authenticity as un∣questionable It is believed to have been written by the Highland courtbard of Malcom III and  has no marks of having been written in Ireland The beginning of this celebrated Duan or short poem is  A eolcha Alban uile  A shluagh feta foltbhuidle  Cia ceud ghabhail aneol duibh  Ro ghabhsadar Alban bruigh  Ye skillful men of Alba ye comely hosts of the yellow tresses know ye the first tribes who posses∣sed Albanian lands Then the bard gives us the fable of Albanus and Brittus from Nennius who wrote in knowing nothing of Locrine Alba∣nactus and Camber sons of Brutus as Geoffrey fabled about Next he mentions that the Nemedians under Erglan settled in Albany af∣ter the siege of Tor Conang in Donegal which is a fable like the former He then proceeds to the Cruthni or Piks and states in conformity with the Irish annals that seventy kings reigned in Pikland before Constantine Next he puts the colony of Riada descended from Conary king of Ireland and says that 'in later time' the three sons of Erc Loarn Fergus and Angus came over After which follows the lift of kings from Loarn and Fergus down to Malcom III with the number of years they reigned This Duan besides its historical merit is also valuable for its curiosity as an ancient specimen of those metrical lists of kings which supplied the place of history in illiterate countries as explained in treating of the Pikish lists Among the oldest monuments of our history is a metrical piece in Latin written in the thirteenth century in ele∣giac measure only beginning with Kenneth But this Duan is more valuable from it's being older by two centuries and that Latin piece is evidently on the model of those used in the vulgar idiom before Latin was in such general use  Without this old Gaelic Duan no series of the princes of Dalriada could have been given for many of them are not found either in the Latin lists or in the Irish Annals Both the Latin lists and Irish Annals however concur to certify this Duan and lend it every degree of historic faith Indeed as the most ancient piece of Dalriadic history preserved by near two cen∣turies this Duan would by every rule of historic authority have merited the preference indepen∣dently of other considerations  There is however a circumstance relating to this old poem with which it is proper that the reader should be acquainted The part of it which contains the kings after Kenneth son of Alpin down to Malcom III tho exact enough in the names and order is yet very defective in the number of years it assigns to most of the reigns Thus to Kenneth III it gives years tho he only reigned to Constantine II the like num∣ber of years tho he also reigned but to Ed years for to Donal II for to Constantin III for to Malcom I for to Odo or Duf for to Kenneth IV for to Constantin IV for to Grim for This chronology would carry the be∣ginning of Macbeth's reign down to the year in defiance of all our chronicles and of the English and Irish historians Nor can there be a doubt that it is totally erroneous throout this part  The Irish antiquaries therefor agree that this later part is corrupted and added by some igno∣rant hand to the former which they depend on as exact But upon consulting one or two persons well skilled in the Irish language i am informed that the style of this later part is identically the same with that of the former and i am perfectly convinced that the whole piece is written by one hand but that the Irish antiquaries assert the con∣trary  merely because they find this later part un∣tenable as in the years assigned it contradicts the best and most numerous authorities Instead there∣for of granting that the years of the former part may be as erroneous as those of the later they at∣tempt to pass this last part as a corrupt addition that they may save the credit of the former But it is certain that the years in the first part often disagree with those of Tighernac and seem fully as uncertain as those of the last  It therefor appears that the bard who wrote this poem tho right in the names and order which he must have had from older poems yet as he probably first thought of giving the years in his verse he had not good authorities for these years but has given them much at random from begin∣ning to end And as our old Latin lists are cer∣tainly far more exact in the later part as to these years so it is but reasonable to infer that they are also more exact in the former The names and order of the kings were duly repeated by the bards at coronations but the number of years they reign∣ed appears not to have been recited on these occa∣sions and were out of the bard's province Our old lists preserved in the Massbooks c are therefor much more to be credited as to the num∣ber of these years for numbers take less hold of the memory than any objects whatever and are of course the least to be trusted of all traditional mat∣ters The best plan of course appeared to be to follow the bard in names and order but to check his numbers from our old lists the Irish Annals and arguments from the nature of the subject It will not indeed be surprizing if the reader should find the list of Dalriadic kings which has cost the author more labour than any part of this work the most unsatisfactory part of it The Pikish Chro∣nicle of the Kings of North Britain was clear and easy but to adjust the obscure series of Dalriadic kings is no less difficult than it is unimportant  The reader will however it is hoped allow that the series of Dalriadic kings preserved in this Gaelic Duan deserves the preference over the old Scotish lists in Latin for the causes above de∣tailed to wit  That the number of Thirty∣four kings given in the Duan is conformable to the general chronology of the neighbouring bar∣baric kingdoms which allows but ten or eleven years for each king whereas Twentyfour would allow fifteen and there is every reason to infer that the Dalriadic kings reigned even a shorter space in general than those of England Pikland or Ireland Nay in the real series after Kenneth till Malcom III the later part of those very Latin lists gives but between eleven and twelve years for each king tho in enlarged power and security  That the old Latin lists are so deficient in general chronology that they want near thirty years of the period which they pretend to reach at the commencement of Kenneth's reign in Pikland  That the old Latin lists are also quite deficient in particular chronology as is clear from dates preserved in the authentic Irish Annals which are right as to the kings of Pikland and the English Heptarchy and cannot be supposed wrong as to those of Dalriada alone about whom on the contrary their intelligence must have been best  That the Duan is more ancient by two centuries than any Latin list preserved and in this respect alone would by every rule of history deserve superior faith The antiquity of the Duan admits of no doubt being judged of by the very same rule followed concerning the Latin lists namely that it was written under the king with whom it ends and the length of whose reign it therefore says was only known to heaven  Let us therefore proceed to digest the genuine series of Dalriadic kings from that Duan Mr O'Flaherty whose accuracy and fidelity in later events and real history are rendered suspicious  by his notorious credulity in fabulous periods has with much care preceded me in this labour His Dalriadic series is in fact the best part of his work for here he was a spectator and not a party  Si sic omnia  But i shall beg leave to differ from him in many points and as his authorities namely the Gaelic Duan with a literal translation and extracts from the translation of the Annals of Ulster in the Musaeum are now on my table i hope i shall not be blamed for using my own eyes and thoughts It must be premised that the An∣nals of Ulster seem accurate in Irish affairs as ap∣pears from the eclipses they mention which upon comparison with the chronology of eclipses in  L' Art de Verifier les Dates  i have never found to differ above one year But in foreign affairs as the actions and deaths of English Pikish and Dalriadic monarchs there are mistakes from three to six years sometimes antedated some∣times postdated The years are right allowing one year as Ware does for the difference in beginning the year but foreign actions are often referred to wrong years tho sometimes also right    Loarn Fergus  sons of Erc reigned together as  Loarn Fergus  above explained This reign began in The Duan says Loarn reigned years But had he reigned so long it is unaccountable that his name should have been omitted in our lists Both he and Fergus were very old when they came to Dalriada and Tighernac speaks of Fergus as dying after a short reign Loarn's reign could hardly exceed one year Muredach son of An∣gus another brother of Loarn possessed the iland Ilay  O'Fl  Erca daughter of Loarn  The Chronicon Rythmicum Innes p bears that one  Lori  led the Scots to Argyle and Innes is puzzled to divine who Lori is It seems surprizing that Innes did not learn from O'Flaherty's Ogygia that  Lori  was  Loarn  Ano∣ther Loarn Abbot of Cluona occurs Ann Ult  was twice married first to Muredach father of Mur∣chert  king of Ireland next to Fergus son of Conal and cousingerman of her first hus∣band to whom among other sons she bore Fed∣lim father of Saint Columba Pompa Bebona as O'Flaherty quaintly latinizes some Irish name another daughter of Loarn was also a mother of three saints    Fergus  I first sole monarch of Dalriada as out∣living his brother and inheriting his part  The first king of Macedon is under a similar difficulty Herodotus lib VIII says Perdiccas was first king Livy and Pausanias make Caranus first king Justin and Solinus say Perdiccas succeeded Caranus Chronologers hence conclude that both reigned at first but that Caranus dying Perdiccas became first sole monarch  A C The Duan gives him a reign of Twentyseven years the old Latin lists only of three Fordun c of sixteen He is sometimes in Irish accounts called Fergus Mor Mac Mise for Mise was his mother's name  O'Fl Mor  does not only imply  Great  but often  tall  or  fat  or by irony  little    Domangard  son of Fergus A C reigned four years  Duan  five according to the old lists and Fordun He had two sons by Fede∣lina daughter of Brian son of Achay Mogmedon king of Ireland namely Congal and Gabran  O'Fl    Congal  son of Domangard A C reigned twentyfour years Duan and so also the old lists Fordun puts twentytwo The Annals of Ulster as has the Chronicon Rythmicum and their authority is here followed    Gabran  son of Domangard A C In this reign there is the greatest difference be∣tween the Duan and the Latin lists the former giving but two years the later twenty two The Annals of Ulster date Congal's death Gabran's and so assign him years Tig∣hernac at the year says  Mors Gaurani filii Domangardi et Albadi a Brudeo filio Milchuonis Rege Pictorum in fugam conversi Dermitio rege  Hiberniae postrema Temorensia comitia celebrante  'The death of Gabran son of Domangard and of Albad put to flight by Brudi son of Milchuon king of the Piks while Dermod king of Ireland was celebrating the last assembly at Temora'  apud O'Fl    Conal  I son of Congal succeeded his uncle A C and reigned fifteen years  Duan  four∣teen according to the old lists The Annals of Ulster and Tighernac say that he gave Hyona to Columba but Beda a far more ancient and better informed writer says that the Piks gave that ile to Columba as above explained The words in the Ulster Annals under are  Mors Conail Mac Comgail anno regni sui    qui ob∣tulit insulam Hy Columcillae  Conal had a son called Donchad who fell in battle at Loro in Kintire after his father's death as we learn from the An∣nals of Ulster A  Bellum de Loro in Kintire in quo cecidit Duncath Mac Conail Mac Comgail et alii multi de sociis filiorum Gauran ceciderunt    Aidan  son of Gabran A C reigned twentyfour years  Duan  thirtyfour by the old lists The Annals of Ulster Fordun and the chronology of the old lists fix his death at and if so he reigned just thirty years O'Flaherty tacitly puts his reign from till or thirtytwo years We know from Beda's express date that Aidan was defeated by Edilfrid in At we find Aidan mentioned in the An∣nals of Ulster Duncath son of Conal seems to have contested the kingdom and the battle of Loro above specified appears to have decided the contest in Aidan's favour A D which just answers to the chronology here laid down and thirty years must be assigned to Aidan's reign But perhaps the Duan dates from his unction as king which as we learn from Adomnan Co∣lumba long deferred having a predilection for Aidan's brother Eogenan Thus there were both  commotions and delay between the death of Conal and complete unction of Aidan as king and in all probability our bard dates from the last epoch and not from the death of Conal which may well have happened some years before One of the old lists also makes Aidan's reign to be of twentyfour years while two others give thirtyfour This Aidan is the most noted of all the Dalriadic kings and Adomnan Beda and the Irish Annals throw con∣siderable light on his reign The Duan calls him  Aidan of the extended territories  and he certainly carried the Dalriadic power to a hight from which it ever after declined till Kenneth ascended the throne of Pikland O'Flaherty tells us that his brother Brandubius as he christens him in his quaint Latin was king of Leinster In we find the battle of Ouc against Aidan mentioned in the Ulster Annals In the battle of Manan in which he was victor O'Flaherty says the ile of Maun From Adomnan we learn that Aidan also conquered in the battle of Miathorum or Micithorum O'Flaherty believes this may be the battle of Lethrigh or Leithredh mentioned in the Annals of Ulster as fought by Aidan in In Aidan was at the famous council of Drumkeat in the Diocese of Dere in Ulster consisting of kings peers and clergy summoned by Aid king of Ireland and mentioned by Adomnan who names the place  Dorsum Ceti  a Latin transla∣tion of Drumkeat Here Columba interceded for the Irish bards whose disorders provoked notice and they were only restricted to Ulster and Dal∣riada whence may spring the superiority of the Highland Ossians and their aversion to Ireland In this council Aidan also procured the remission of all homage due by the kings of Dalriada to those of Ireland which indeed considering the case it is natural to infer they at first paid If we credit Irish writers the acts of this famous council are still extant In Eugain son of Gabran and  brother of Aidan died  Ann Ult  It is likely he is the Eoganan of Adomnan whom Columba pre∣ferred to Aidan In Aidan appears in the page of Beda under the name of  Edan rex Scotto∣rum qui Britanniam inhabitant  as coming against Edilfrid king of Northumberland with a great army but conquered and escaping with few Beda adds 'Nor from that time has any king of the Scots in Britain dared to come to battle with the English to this day' i e Nor indeed ever after till Kenneth was called to the Pikish throne In Aidan died at an advanced age probably more oppressed with chagrin at his last severe check than elated with former successes Fordun says he died in Kintyre and was buried at Kilcheran where no king was buried before Do∣mangard a son of Aidan fell at Kirkuin the year after Columba's death or A C  Codex Cluan et Tighern apud O'Fl  Tighernac mentions that Conan another son of Aidan was drowned A C Adomnan says Domangard was slain in Saxonia or England perhaps at the battle of  bellica in strage  and he deserves the greatest credit He also tells that Artur and Eochod Find sons of Aidan fell at the battle of Micitorum above mentioned and that Eochod Buidhe succeeded his father and that there were yet other younger brothers of whom Conan above mentioned may have been one    Eochoid  I  Buidhe  son of Aidan A C reigned seventeen years  Duan  sixteen by the old lists and Fordun Adomnan fully instructs us that Eochod succeeded his father Aidan  Echodius autem Buide post patrem in regnum successit  lib I c so that Fordun's placing him after Connad Keir is a direct and gratuitous falsifi∣cation of our old lists and of Adomnan whose words he is so shameless as to quote    Connad Keir  son of Conal A C reigned only three months  Duan Old Lists For∣dun  The Irish accounts bear that he was son of Eochoid the last king which is improbable as Eochoid was a young son of Aidan and a child after his father came to the throne as appears from Adomnan and Fercar son of Connad Keir instantly succeeded him Eochoid could not be above fiftythree when he died and how could he have a grandson fit to reign The Duan cited by O'Flaherty to this purport says no such thing The old Lists mark Connad Keir as the son of Conal probably the king in Tig∣hernac puts the death of Connad Keir at and the annals of Ulster at But their dates are sometimes wrong From Tighernac we learn that in the last year of Eochoid Buide Connad Keir conquered and slew Fiachna son of Deman king of Ulster in the battle of Ardco∣ran And in the only year of Connad Malcaich son of Scanlan king of the Crutheni or Piks in Ireland vanquished Connad Keir in battle at Fea∣oin In which fell Dicol of the royal race of the Piks Rigallan son of Conan Falby son of Eochoid and grandsons of Aidan and Ostric son of Albert a Saxon prince with a vast slaugh∣ter of others The power of these Crutheni hence appears very considerable Connad Keir did not dy in battle but soon after probably of his wounds or of a wounded spirit    Fercar  I son of Connad Keir A C reigned sixteen years  Duan  and so the old lists  The lists call him son of Ewen O'Flaherty finding Tig∣hernac date Eochoid Buide's death at and Connad Keir's at extends Eochoid's reign to years and reduces Fercar's to less than one year He appears to be right Perhaps Fercar and Donal Brec reigned together and the former as the son of an unknown Ewen may have been of the house of Lorn as was Fercar II  But it appears from the reign of his successor Do∣nal Brec more noted in history that the later must have succeeded about Of course not  more than eight years can be allowed for the reign of Fercar The numbers in the Duan are often false and the Dalriadic series cannot be ex∣pected to resemble the Pikish in clearness but must be digested from various materials and re∣conciled to general chronology Torfaeus in arranging the series of Danish kings now univer∣sally received as authentic uses infinitely more freedom than shall be admitted in this Dalriadic series    Donal  I  Brec  son of Eochoid Buidhe succeeded his nephew A C and reigned twelve years The Duan and lists say fourteen The translation of the annals of Ulster in the Mu∣saeum has singular errors concerning Fercar son of Connad Keir whose death it marks in and concerning Donal Brec At it bears  Bellum apud Calaros in quo victus est Domnall Brec  and at  Talorg Mac Acithen et Domnal Brecc Mac Eacha mortui sunt  There are interpo∣lated passages in the annals of Ulster  manu recen∣tiore  and these are certainly of them For the Duan old lists and Fordun all concur to put the reign of Donal Brec from about till between and The annals of Ulster tho a valu∣able compilation were only completed in the year and often quote Tighernac who wrote about Now Tighernac puts the reign of Donal Brec The battle of Moyrath in which he was totally defeated was fought in the reign of Donal Mac Ed king of Ireland and is a known epoch of Irish history There was no other Donal king of Ireland till The genuine annals of Ulster say at  Mors Domnail Mac Aodha regis Hiberniae in fine Januarii Postea Domnal in bello Fraithe Cairvin in fine anni mense Decembri interfectus est et an  xv  regnavit  The later Domnal is Domnal Brec king of Dalriada slain at Fraith Cairvin by Hoan king of the Britons as O'Flaherty mentions from  the same Annals Donal son of Ed king of Ireland died in at Ardfothaig in the th year of his reign as Ware informs Adom∣nan also tells us that Donal Brec was grandson of Aidan and was defeated at Roth MoyRoth by Domnail grandson of Amurec for Aid fa∣ther of Domnail king of Ireland was son of Amurec See Ware The reign of Donal Brec is therefore fixt and the dates of the annals of Ulster must be gross interpolations and they indeed form the only grand errors i have observed in that work  Perhaps this was another Donal Brec But these Annals as completed and interpolated have some mistakes At we sind  Mors Offa filii Etilbrith rex Saxonum  read  Oswy  Offa died  In the Musaeum MS at it is  Donald Breoo  At is  Mors Catasuidh  NEPOS  Domnail Bricc  an argument that the grandfather was dead long before  This Donal Brec was sin∣gularly unfortunate and his reign as ruinous to Dalriada as that of Aidan his grandfather had at first been advantageous Congal Claon king of Ullagh having slain Suibney king of Ireland Donal brother of Suibney succeeded in de∣feated Congal and forced him to take refuge in Britain Here Congal gained assistance and espe∣cially that of Donal Brec who in attended him to Ireland with an army but after a long and desperate battle at Moyrath Congal and Do∣nal were defeated The former was slain The later so reduced that in Adomnan's time or about the year Dalriada was in constant dread of utter subjection  Adomnan lib III c telling from Cuminius the pro∣phecy of Columba against Aidan's descendants adds "Hoc autem vaticinium temporibus nostris completum est in bello Roth Domnaldo Brecco nepote Aidani sine causa vastante provinciam  i e regnum  Domnail nepotis Amureq Et à die illausque hodie adhuc in proclivo sunt ab extraneis quod suspiria doloris pectori incutit" Hence it is clear that Do∣nal Brec was grandson of Aidan and reigned in the time of Domnail grandson of Amureq that is Donal II son of Aod son of Amurec who died in the year nor was there another Donal king of Ireland till  Indeed Aidan was  the only great prince that Dalriada had and it is clear from the annals of Ulster that after this the little kingdom declined almost to annihilation before when Kenneth came to the Pikish throne In there was a battle at Glen Mure∣san in which Donal Brec was again defeated  "Bellum Gline Mareson in quo exercitus Domnaldi Brec in fugam versus et Etain obsidetur" Tighernac ad Ann "Bellum Gline Muresan et obsessio Edin"  Ann Ult  ad  In he was slain at Fraith Cairvin fighting against Hoan in all probability a king of StratClyde    Conal  II Began to reign and the survivor Conal reigned ten years  Duan  Conal according to O'Fla∣herty was son of Eochoid Buidhe  Surely not for when Cuminius wrote his life of Co∣lumba about the year the descendants of Aidan had lost the royalty as Columba prophesied  Cuminii Vita Columbae  cap  and younger brother of Donal Brec Of Dungal nothing is known His name signifies  the black stranger    Dungal  I Began to reign and the survivor Conal reigned ten years  Duan  Conal according to O'Fla∣herty was son of Eochoid Buidhe  Surely not for when Cuminius wrote his life of Co∣lumba about the year the descendants of Aidan had lost the royalty as Columba prophesied  Cuminii Vita Columbae  cap  and younger brother of Donal Brec Of Dungal nothing is known His name signifies  the black stranger    Donal  II  Duin  son of Conal II accord∣ing to O'Flaherty began to reign and ruled thirteen years  Duan    Malduin  seventeen years  Duan  the old lists say sixteen These lists by an easy mis∣take have past from Donal Brec to Donal Duin confounding the two Donals and have thus lost three kings O'Flaherty on his own authority says Malduin was son of Conal II but the re∣gister of St Andrew's says he was son of Donal  Duin  or as misprinted  Durn  This affords no small confirmation of the accuracy of the Duan which alone preserves the reign of this Donal Duin  Thus far the House of Fergus apparently ruled After this the House of Loarn began to hold the sovereignty and contests arose which seem finally to have extinguished both houses    Fercar  II  Fada  or Tall A C reigned twentyone years Duan and Old Lists This prince was the first of the house of Loarn and in the eighth generation from Loarn as O'Flaherty says and indeed is right running a parallel with the house of Fergus That Fercar II began a new house is clear from all the old Latin lists in which his father's name appears not tho that of all the rest be marked After this also Tighernac and the Annals of Ulster mention frequent conflicts between the houses of Lorn and Argyle sometimes the one gaining the sove∣reignty sometimes the other as after stated    Eochoid  II pronounce Achy  Rinnevail  or Hooked Nose A C reigned two years Duan the old lists say three All agree that he was the son of Domangart son of Donal Brec and consequently of the house of Fergus Do∣mangart died  Tighernac Ann Ult    Ambkellac  son of Fercar Fada of the house of Loarn A C reigned one year  Duan Lists  The Annals of Ulster say he was expelled his kingdom and sent bound to Ireland This event they date but are generally some years wrong  The book of Lecan written has fol col the genealogy of Anbkelly son of Fercar Fada up to Loarn O'r lah Ogyg Vind p The same work has a  Commentarius de Antiquitate Albaniae  but is of so late date as to deserve little credit      Selvac  brother of Ambkellac A C reigned twenty years The old lists are now totally perverted and place Selvac about TEN REIGNS later which is the chief flaw in their or∣der their other faults arising from omission  The Duan is also defective and wants two reigns here But the reign of Selvac is so marked by the Irish Annals as to be very clear In Selvac destroyed Dunaila  Ann Ult  this was before he was king if the Annals err not by a few years as not unusual But they seem right here as they date the death of Adomnan and of Alfred king of Northumberland in After this we find no more of Selvac for thirteen years He is then of∣tener mentioned than Aidan or any other Dal∣riadic king In the Annals of Ulster he appears at at at at at his sons at at as after statedPerhaps it may be said that all these dates are erroneous as we found above that Donal Brec appears in these Annals no less than fortythree years after his time so Selvac may be put fifty years before his time But it must be observed  That the two erroneous passages abovementioned con∣cerning Donal Brec are exceptions not rules there being no other such errors in these Annals so that even the chance is here more than a thou∣sand to one that they are right  Those two erroneous articles stand single and without conse∣quences or connection while these concerning Selvac are interwoven with marked events of the time  The two passages concerning Donal Brec are contradictory of other passages concern∣ing him in these very Annals as above ex∣plained whereas the articles respecting Selvac have not one contradiction or discordance  The passages concerning Donal Brec are but two these about Selvac amount to no less than eight interwoven with other circumstances so that the chance of fallacy is less by three quarters  Tighernac the genuine old annalist positively contradicts the annals of Ulster as to Donal Brec but fully confirms them as to Selvac  These rea∣sons will it is believed be found more than suf∣ficient to fix the reign of Selvac here and to  shew that the old lists are in this one respect not only defective but disorderedLet us now at∣tend to some particulars of Selvac's reign In we find him destroy Dunolla  This is surely the noted castle of Dunolly in Lorn Mr Pennant vol III says that opposite to Kerrera an ile remarkable for the death of Alex II "On a great rock within land is the castle of Dunolly once the residence of the chiefs of Lorn" It is near Dunstafnage on the south  in he builds it and it is destroyed by his daughter Alena  Ann Ult  I suspect this to be one event variously told and that the later is the true date But this is of no moment In Selvac appears in two battles One against Ambkellach his bro∣ther who is conquered and slain About Selvac appears to have usurped the kingdom seized his reigning brother Ambkellach and sent him bound to Ireland as above mentioned Amb∣kellach is called  The Good  in the Duan and his mildness seems to have prompted his brother's ambition For about twelve years Ambkellach seems to have lived in banishment as Malcom in Macbeth's time but in he at length pro∣cured assistance and was slain in asserting his kingdom Selvac was a warlike prince tho a bad man and in the same year fought a naval bat∣tle against Duncha Beg or Duncan the little of the house of Argyle but king only of Cantire Selvac having apparently seized that part of Ar∣gyle which was next Lorn his patrimonial country Selvac lost this seafight in which many chiefs fell and which happened off Ardanesse some promontory in Argyleshire In we find  Cle∣ricatus Selvaich  or that Selvac went into a mo∣nastery But this life undertaken probably in penance for the murder of his brother suited not his temper and he seems to have aspired to so∣vereignty again For in or was ano∣ther battle in Argyle between Selvac and the clan of Echtach grandson of Domnail Duncha Beg  died in and this Echtach was perhaps his son and grandson of Domnail or Donal II Duin and the same who succeeded Selvac for  Echtach  and Eochoid seem but one name differently spelt Three years after this battle Selvac died say tho the Annals of Ulster put The fratricide of Selvac was punished on his race soon after as shall be shewn    Eochoid  III or Achy began to reign A C and ruled about ten years as appears from the dates of Selvac his predecessor and of Murdac his successor This king is also lost along with Selvac in the Duan This is the last  Achy  in the Dalriadic series and there is none in the Pikish nor in the United series so that this is the famous Achy who according to our fables made à league with Charlemagne who was yet unborn That silly fiction has been amply con∣futed  By Dalrymple Lord Hailes in his "Remarks on the History of Scotland" Yet this excellent writer supposes that as the double tressure appears on the Scotish arms in Wil∣liam's time the league must have been formed at that period But it is now known to be more than dubi∣ous if the fleur de lis appeared in the French arms before and at any rate it is denied that Scotland was so very humble as to borrow any part of her arms from France as poor esquires have been known to do from nobles The double tressure is of spearheads symbolic of warlike spirit I assent therefor to the modern French writers and to Ry∣mer that there was no league whatever between France and Scotland till one was formed by John Baliol which served as a basis for others dishonourable and destructive to Scot∣land See Rymer's Letters to Nicolson London  vo  where it is observed that among the papers in the Scotish treasury tho there were  transacta  with England Nor∣way Flanders kings of Maun there was not a scrap con∣cerning France Du Cange mentions a league between the French king and Llewellyn prince of Wales sealed with gold but we find no league of that antiquity between France and Scotland Matthew Paris gives the league between Henry III of E and Alex II whereby the kings of Scotland are bound never to make any league with the enemies of England The consequences of the French league were not mutual assist∣ance for Scotland assisted France while France never assisted Scotland but the putting of Scotland into French pay as Swizzerland has since been Corruption spred even to the throne and let the battle of Flodden speak the effects Our weaker writers think this league an honour to the country  miserum est aliorum incumbere famae  Ne collapsa ruant subductis tecta columnis  The reader who wishes to see the old French opinion of Scotland is referred to Froissart and the modern to Voltaire on Universal history Such contemptuous allies could hardly be of service  and its total absurdity will appear in full  light from this whole work Charlemagne could not know the existence of the kings of Argyle The kings of North Britain were those of the Piks But the  reges Scottorum  who according to Eginhart were at his obedience were those of Ireland from which country different men of saintly learning adorned his court and capitalThis Achy who succeeded Selvac is called  Eochal Annuine  in the old lists translated  Achaius  in the modern  Annuine  is in some of these lists as that in the chronicle of Melrose translated  Veneosus  'Poisonous' and he has certainly poisoned our history with nonsense There was an old king of Ireland called Achy Apthach or 'poisonous' because there was a great mortality of his subjects in his reign The old lists finding it necessary to pervert genealogy in perverting or∣der make Achy son of Ed Fin who did not reign till ten years after him Tighernac as quoted by O'Flaherty says at the year  Achaius filius Achaii rex Dalriadae mortuus est  This sentence of Tighernac's must be translated from the Irish by O'Flaherty for the old writers know of no such name as  Achaius  but give  Eochod  and  Echa  But it might seem from the Annals of Ulster that this Achy was son of Duncan Beg son of Donal II or Duin The genealogy of the Dalriadic kings is indeed here totally broken and lost As to Irish or Highland genealogies the abortions of ignorant bards and unknown in  ancient documents they can only be credited by people as weak and ignorant as themselves    Murdac  son of Ambkellach began to reign A C and continued three years  Duan Lists  Tighernac at  Muredachus filius Anbkellachi regnum generis Loarni assumit  The same year Tighernac informs us that Dun∣gal son of Selvac made an expedition into Ulster and Flahertac king of Ireland recalled his fleet from the Dalreudini or hired theirs probably to oppose Dungal In the third or last year of Murdac Ungust son of Vergust king of the Piks seems totally to have destroyed the Dal∣riadic kingdom  See the Extracts from the Annals of Ulster in the Ap∣pendix  He wasted it's whole territo∣ries took Dunat  Perhaps  Duna  in Lorn on the east of Dunolly See Pont's maps in Bleau's Atlas  and burned Creic and put Dungal and Ferach the two sons of Selvac in chains Soon after in the same year Talorgan brother of Ungust and his general put Murdac son of Ambkellach to utter rout and many chiefs were slain In Ungust again ravaged Dal∣riada After this the history of Dalriada is al∣most annihilated in Tighernac the Annals of Ul∣ster and other authentic documents  THESE events call for a pause in order to in∣vestigate a curious and important point in our his∣tory namely What line of princes held the Dal∣riadic sceptre at the time the kings of Dalriada are said to have acceded to the Pikish throne  To form a due estimate of this question let us state what few further notices we find in the An∣nals of Ulster on the affairs of Dalriada  A  o  Death of Dunlaing son of Duncan king of the sept of Argyle Argal  A  o  Fergus son of Eachah king of Dal∣riada died  A  o  Doncorcai king of Dalriada died  A  o  The killing of Conal son of Aoain at Kintire  A  o  Angus son of Dunlaing king of Argyle died  The reign of Angus after Constantine is given in the Duan as of nine years But it is not clear that this Angus is the king of  Ardgail  in the Annals of Ulster From to we find the kings and wars of  Airgialla  in Ireland mentioned in these Annals and perhaps the Ardgail of may be the later  In the same Annals the kings of  Laoaire  occur from to but cannot be confounded with those of  Loarn  ex∣cept by a careless reader Nor can those of  Dalarai  which go from to the th century be mistaken for those of  Dal∣riado  as the names are carefully spelt in the original  The only difficulty concerns  Airgialla  a large province of Ireland comprizing present Louth Monaghan and Ar∣magh Ware Scr Hib p and  Argyle  in Scotland I will not be positive that the later is ever mentioned in Irish an∣nals except under the name of Dalriada But the  sept of Argal  at could not be applied to the large country of Airgial in Ireland which no where else bears that diminutive title And we know from the Duan that an Angus was king of Dalriada at this time  The history of the Irish Dalriada is very obscure It is noticed till in the Annals of Ulster as in leagues or battles with its neighbours of Ullagh Dalarai Airgialla c But i sind no kings of it mentioned It seems to have been subject to the kings of British Dalriada till the Danes invaded Ireland and after a period of confusion was an∣nexed to the domain of the O'Neils kings of Ulster  Ardgail  These are all the notices to be found from till when the death of Kenneth son of Al∣pin king of the Piks is marked  The after kings of Dalriada as appears from the Duan c stand thus After an interreg∣num    Aod  r yrs    Donal  III    Fergus  II    Doncorcai      Conal  III    Conal  IV    Constantin      Angus  r yrs    Aod  II    Eoganan      Dungal  II    Alpin      Kenneth    From the Annals of Ulster it would appear that Dunlaing son of Duncan Beg and brother of Achy succeeded Achy in Argyle Conal son of Aoian or Owen might be an Irish prince for his death only being mentioned it does not ap∣pear that he reigned in Kintire In is the last intelligence concerning Dalriadic affairs the death of Angus son of Dunlaing king of the sept of Argyle  We are unhappily in the greatest darkness just before the morning breaks in the reign of Ken∣neth son of Alpin The apparent genealogy of Angus last king of Argyle mentioned is Angus son of Dunlaing son of Duncan Beg son of Donal II Duin These four generations extend from to being years whereas by common rules they ought to be but Dun∣can Beg died about Dunlaing An∣gus But Donal Duin must thus have been born a full century before the death of Duncan Beg so that there is no room to infer that Donal Duin was the Domnail who was father of Dun∣can Beg The line of Fergus was certainly lost on the death of Achy Rinneval and Duncan Beg is only called king of Cantire not even of Argyle At any rate it is clear by all accounts that his race did not come to the Pikish sceptre for not one name of them occurs in the genealogy of Kenneth son of Alpin It stands thus in the old Latin lists and genealogies Kenneth f Alpin f Achy Annuine f Aod Fin f Achy Rinneval f Domangart f Donal Brec One old genealogy says f Aod Fin f Achy f Achy f Domangart  Innes p f  Echadach  f  Echach  and thus adds one generation Donal Brec died  Kenneth include Donal and the space will amount to about years and for this we have eight generations by the last account or years which is fair But alas all is out of order Kenneth and Alpin are undoubted Achy Rinne∣val lived and thus might be father of Aod Fin But Aod Fin reigned so could not be father of Achy Annuine nor could Achy Annuine be father of Alpin Domangart died so that the insertion of another Achy between him and Achy Rinneval is erroneous Achy Annuine was perhaps son of another Achy as Tighernac says and the double Achy is here if any where If wanting a generation is wanting and the list incomplete But the above radical faults are more than suffi∣cient to stamp the whole genealogy as one mass of falsehood the mere work of some ignorant Highland sennarchy  It must be clear to every reader that Duncan Beg and the princes of his family were the sole representatives of Fergus and hereditary kings of Argyle They are so called and the clan Ar∣gyle always appears with those of that stem against that of Loarn Certainly then they were their undoubted and hereditary princes The clan Argyle would never at the price of their blood have supported a race of usurpers or divided and weakened the kingdom for their sake They would not have contended against the house of Lorn surely better intitled to be chiefs of Argyle than any usurping race The attachment of the highlanders to their hereditary chiefs is well known and forbids such an idea absurd indeed in itself But neither Duncan Beg nor any of his race appear among the ancestors of Kenneth son of Alpin There is therefore reason to con∣clude that Kenneth was not of the house of Argyle nor descended from Fergus son of Erc  Was he then of the house of Loarn This ques∣tion is yet more strongly answered in the negative by all the lists and genealogies  As Kenneth was certainly neither of the house of Lorn nor of Fergus it remains to examine how his ancestors came to the throne of Dalriada or rather of Lorn for Argyle seems to have re∣tained it's petty princes till at least In and Dalriada was totally wasted by Ungust king of Pikland and the princes of Lorn bound in chains Those of Argyle were certainly not placed on the throne of Dalriada by the victor for in we find Dunlaing only styled king of the sept or clan of Argyle In Fergus who by the old Latin lists was son of Aod Fin is called king of Dalriada as in is Doncorcai In the race of Argyle are only marked as kings of Argyle In when Dunlaing was king of Argyle Aod Fin was king of Dalriada Thus nothing can be clearer in such remote periods than that the kings of Dalriada were not of the house of Argyle after Achy Annuine That they were not of the house of Lorn is as clear For Ungust in his conquest of Dalriada threw the princes of Lorn Dungal and Fe∣rach into chains and their names never appear either in the lists or genealogies so that Aod Fin and the new royal stem of Dalriada did not be∣long to the house of Lorn  There is therefore every reason to infer that Ungust king of Pikland upon his conquest of Dalriada appointed a sovereign Aod Fin and that this sovereign was neither of the house of Lorn nor that of Argyle Of what race then was he Common sense and the usual practice in such cases dictate that Aod was of the Pikish royal race and in all probability so of Ungust  The Annals of Ulster at have  Combustio Killemere a Hugone Mac Aongusa  Hugo and Aod Aongus and Ungust are the same names as appears from these Annals our lists c The king of the Piks may have sent his son to assist one provincial king in Ireland against another  who by the Pikish constitution above explained  could not ascend the Pikish throne as his father had reigned Ungust certainly had sons arrived at manhood at the time of conquering Dalriada for in the very year of the first conquest and cap∣tivity of Dungal and Ferach is marked the death of Brudi a son of Ungust The Celtic language perverts names strangely as the reader may have seen in many instances before  Aod  pronounced  Ed  is translated  Hugh  by O'Flaher  y and all the Irish writers There is a Pikish name  Wid  certainly more like  Ed  than  Hugh  is The addition  Fin  or  White  is generally applied to the Gothic race by the Celts as  Fingal the white foreigners  c for the Celts are dusky the Goths fair These slight matters have some weight here This Ed Fin by the Duan and the lists reigned thirty years being the longest reign since that of Aidan Argyle had its own princes yet he was not molested by them as others of the house of Lorn had been tho the native strength of Lorn had been crushed by Ungust This cir∣cumstance speaks a new and firm power It was na∣tural that Lorn which chiefly bordered on the Piks as Argyle did on the Stratclyde Britons should have most intercourse with the Piks and be the chief object of their enmity or support It is also pro∣bable that Ed Fin might by the female line have a claim to the kingdom of Lorn and as the Piks regarded only the female line his claim or that of his father assigned to him might be supported and even allowed by the clan of Lorn who had no reason to respect the race of the fra∣tricide Selvac If Ungust gave the kingdom of Dalriada to his son the case was paralleled in the kingdom of Cumbria afterward held by the sons of the Scotish kings  Another singular circumstance deserves atten∣tion Conal Constantin Angus Eoganan are kings of Dalriada Canul Constantin Ungust Uven or Eogan are kings of Pikland If we sup∣posed an error in the dates of the Annals of Ulster concerning Doncorcai whose reign we may with the greatest probability suppose to be a little misdated as are many others in these Annals here are four kings in Dalriada who apparently came to the Pikish throne before Kenneth Ca∣nul and Conal seem the same The name of Constantin is not to be found in the Irish or Dalria∣dic names of kings tho it is in the Pikish and it therefore affords a slight additional proof that the new Dalriadic stem was Pikish And Angus or Un∣gust and Uven or Eoganan were in appearance kings of Dalriada before they came to the Pikish throne All that Kenneth did in that case was to render the Pikish crown hereditary which before had been elective I suspect that this Eoganan was the father or Alpin and that his name was from similar sound confounded with Eochoid An∣nuine as in Irish pronunciation the names can hardly be distinguished If so Alpin was son of Eoganan or Uven king of the Piks who was son of Ungust king of the Piks who was son of Vergust called Fergus by the Celtic writers Hence the fable of Kenneth's descent from Fergus son of Erc might spring for tradition confounds all chronology in such matters and as the Dal∣riadic Scots had all the little learning then known in North Britain it was natural that they should apply to their own Fergus the genealogy of Ken∣neth We have an Alpin king of the Piks in and another and there is an Alpin king of the Saxons mentioned in the Annals of Ulster at if it be not a mistake for Alpin II king of the Piks who died that year but no  such name appears in either the Irish or Dalriadic list of kings Is not this also an additional proof that Kenneth was really of Pikish extract Tig∣hernac and Caradoc of Llancarvon mentioning his death in call him simply  king of the Piks  without one hint of any acquired domi∣nion But of this afterward  Upon the whole the genealogy of Kenneth is so utterly lost that the name of his grandfather can never be ascertained The probability is clearly that he was a Pikish prince who suc∣ceeded his father Alpin in the kingdom of Dal∣riada an inferior Pikish monarchy since the days of Aod Fin and that taking advantage of the in∣ternal divisions in Pikland he with the help of his Dalriadic subjects seized the Pikish throne That he was not of the old Dalriadic race is cer∣tain There is a break in that series before Aod Fin and another before Alpin that Celtic forgery has not been able to supply even plausibly  Aod Fin according to O'Flaherty and the La∣tin lists was son of Achy Rinneval according to the old genealogy he was son of Achy son of Achy Rinneval But even O'Flaherty can assign no genealogy for the TEN following kings down to Alpin And that Aod Fin was not of the house of Argyle and could not be son of Achy Rinneval has been shewn above  But the name of the father of Alpin father of Kenneth i will venture to say is lost beyond all recovery This will strike any reader at once upon looking at the pitiful shifts and perversions used in this business Two plans have been adopted and both equally false  The Latin lists published by Innes which were drawn up in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries being some of the oldest monuments of our history extant make Alpin son of Achy Annuine son of Aod Fin The old genealogy  repeated by a Highlander at the coronation of Alexander III has the same This strange account has run thro Fordun down to Buchanan and our own times yet is as palpably false and ignorant as could be expected even from a High∣land genealogist For as above shewn Achy An∣nuine succeeded Selvac in or in when Selvac retired to a monastery The old Latin lists confirm this fully For as the compilers found that Selvac and Achy followed Ambkellac who by their own statement reigned about the year and that Achy of course could not be the father of Alpin they were forced to take out both Selvac and Achy and throw them back before Dungal and Alpin The reason of this  only  perversion in the order of the old lists thus appears at once The ignorant authors of this childish and easy falsification did not know that the reign of Selvac was the most certain and fixt of any in the whole list without exception be∣ing mentioned in no less than eight places and interwoven with noted events in the Annals of Tighernac and Ulster and that the death of Achy his successor was marked by Tighernac who wrote in at the year Such being the case this pitiful forgery and it's cause be∣come selfapparent This Achy who succeeded Selvac is the last in our history There are three  Eochoids  pronounced  Achys  in the Dalria∣dic series  Achy Buide  or the Yellow son of Aidan  Achy Rinneval  or Hooked Nose son of Domangart son of Donal Brec and lastly  Achy Annuine  or the Poisonous who both by the Annals of Tighernac and the old lists succeeded Selvac and could not possibly be the father of Alpin But one falsehood must be supported by others and the fabricators of these old lists following the secondsighted Highland genealogists made Achy Annuine son of Aod  Fin who did not reign till ten years after his death Dungal son of Selvac who is never called king of Dalriada and it is certain never reigned they make the same with Dungal pre∣decessor of Alpin tho he was put in chains But it is needless to dwell longer on so glaring a falsification completely refutable in a dozen different ways Let the candid reader con∣sult his own thoughts and pronounce if these poor shifts amount not to more than a confession that the father of Alpin is totally unknown to every domestic monument of our history  The Irish accounts are at least as lame as the Scotish O'Flaherty finding that Alpin be∣longed to no genealogy of Dalriadic kings has made a father for him He has used the freedom to add two Achys to the Dalriadic list to make up the real number of fiftytwo kings tho upon looking into the Annals of Ulster he might have seen that Fergus and Doncorcai were the two names wanting in the Duan the first of which is also evinced from our old lists For the first supposed Achy whom he calls Achy IV he alledges the book of Synchronism which makes an Achy king of Dalriada at the time of the death of Aid Ollain king of Ireland or But O'Flaherty seems to have redd  Eochoid  for  Aod  the real king of Dalriada at that time and our old lists ac∣knowlege only the three Achys above stated It is indeed likely that the Book of Synchronisms may by a mistake of a few years mean Achy III But his Achy V whom he places after Eoganan and makes the father of Alpin who succeeds him is the offspring of his own brains being unknown to the Duan Old Lists Irish Annals and every historical monument whatever O'Flaherty could forge as well as another genealogist and found this insertion necessary but could not even co∣lour the falsehood To this Achy V he cannot  assign even one year's reign The three genera∣tions of Achy V Alpin Kenneth he puts in a course of twenty years The Duan tho defective in three other places cannot be so here as the very rimes shew that there was no king between Dungal II and Alpin Yet O'Flaherty leaves out Dungal to make room for this Achy V Thus it is clear from both Irish and Scotish accounts that the name of Alpin's father is quite unknown  I must confess that this total failure of the Dalria∣dic list was most unexpected by me and struck me with great surprize when i discovered it for i had always regarded it as a certain fact that the Old Scotish or Dalriadic line had in direct and clear genealogy acceded to the Pikish throne But the above cogent reasons force me to abandon this idea and to allow that the very contrary was the truth and that the Pikish race acceded to the throne of Dalriada a century before the Piks and Scots were united under Kenneth Such be∣ing the case the Irish extraction of our kings falls to the ground in spite of all the labour which Irish antiquaries have employed to prove it and their labours have indeed only proved the reverse It is from their own annals and antiquaries that this discovery can alone be placed in the clearest day But this point and the origin of the new name of Scotland shall be treated afterward  Let us conclude with a brief review of the Dal∣riadic series This series may be divided into Two Parts the CLEAR and the OBSCURE The FIRST Part reaches from Loarn and Fergus or the beginning down to the reign of  Aod Fin  The SECOND or OBSCURE Part reaches from that epoch to the end This very circumstance of the last part being obscure certainly shews a kingdom declining in power and not increasing so as to conquer the great Pikish kingdom as vulgarly dreamed Had the later been the case  the history of Dalriada would have been more and more important and notorious while in fact after it's conquest by Ungust it sinks to nothing at once The Pikish affairs on the con∣trary become more and more known This is left to the cool consideration of the reader In the FIRST Part the Duan Old Lists and Irish Annals mutually confirm each other The only additional kings not found in our old lists are THREE together  Conal  II  Dungal  I and  Donal  II  Duin  And the reason of their omission is appa∣rent namely the mere mistake of passing  Donal Brec  and  Donal Duin  as one person  Like errōrs occur in Scandinavian history from the same cause See the writings of Torfaeus  possim  Yet the list of St Andrew's plainly confirms the Duan by marking Malduin as son of Donal Duin as above mentioned There is indeed a gross per∣version and the  only  one in the lists namely the taking out  Selvac  and  Achy Annuine  his successor from their real station after Ambkellac and making them exchange places with Aod II and Eoganan For the two  Eogans  one before one after Murdac in the lists are only  Aod  II and  Eoganan  misnamed with Murdac put be∣tween them to prevent the two Eogans from jar∣ring and passing as one  In the Register of St Andrew's Innes p the first is called  Heatgan  the later  Heoghan  The former seems  Het Ed  or  Aod  with an epithet  gan  The later is Eoganan  Allowing for this one perversion the order of kings in the Duan and old lists is quite the same throout But of TWELVE kings from  Aod  II to  Alpin  the lists have but SIX the other six being omitted imme∣diately after Aod I and all together successively save one  Fergus  II This omission seems to have partly arisen like the former by passing two kings of the same name as one namely  Aod  I and  Aod  II Such omissions often occur in transcrip∣tion  while additions can never spring from this source which is an additional argument for the larger series But from till is therefore the OBSCURE part of Dalriadic history and no pains should be spared to investigate it  CHAPTER VI  Manners Languages Antiquities c of the Old British Scots  THE manners and language of the Ancient British Scots being the same with those of the Irish Scots their progenitors little need be said on this subject Both are Gothic mingled with Celtic Ancient writers represent the Irish Scots and their progeny the Attacotti as savages in the extreme These accounts are confirmed by the long description of the Irish given by Giral∣dus Cambrensis by the constant epithets of  feri  and  sylvicolae  given to our Highlanders by our wri∣ters and by the infallible evidence of present ob∣servation In vain do Irish writers attempt to reason against the ocular testimony of Giraldus and to persuade us that the Old Irish were not savages We must entreat them not to reason us out of our senses by decrying the evidence of our own eyes For the Wild Irish are the genuine remains of the Old Irish with the very manners described by ancient writers  Those Scots or Goths who ruled in Ireland were soon lost among the numerous Celtic natives In the time of Saint Patrick a great dis∣tinction prevailed as above shewn but soon after the term Scots became general to all the inhabi∣tants of Ireland which was itself called  Scotia  and the  Lingua Scotica  was the Gaelic of Ireland But in the time of Saint Patrick  Scotus  and  Hi∣bernus  were by no means synonymous and it  seems thence certain that they were not so in the Third century when Riada led his colony of Scots not Hiberni to Pikland nor so soon after Patrick's time as when Loarn and Fergus reestablished the colony Beda calls Aidan  rex Scottorum in Britannia  and it is appa∣rent that the Dalriadic Scots consisted chiefly of Scots or Goths of Ireland tho using the Celtic tongue From this circumstance may spring the peculiar Gothic epithet of 'yellow haired' given to the Albanach by the poet of the Duan and the superior warlike spirit of the Highlanders com∣pared to the Wild Irish But the Highlanders tho originally rather Goths than Celts and tho afterward mingled with Piks and Norwegians had been so contaminated with a Celtic mixture in Ireland that their speech and most of their man∣ners were and are rather Celtic than Gothic  Dr Macpherson Dr Smith in his Gaelic Antiquities and others give long accounts of the manners of the High∣lands Those authors under the idea of Druidic manners c give us the commonest Norwegian customs left by them in the Highlands as appears from the Scandinavian antiqua∣ries whom they never consult  It has been long since asserted and lately repeated that the Celtic and Tartar languages approximate but upon look∣ing into the specimens in Chamberlayne's Oratio Dominica it will be seen at once that there is not the smalle stsimilarity The names of Tartar chiefs may be easily interpreted in Cel∣tic by those ignorant of the true meaning Any names will bear such interpretation in any speech See Swift's Etymo∣logies  passim  And in laziness filth and every species of savage∣ness they have been always hardly distinguishable from the savages of Ireland In all ages of our history they are marked as the savages of Scot∣land and uniformly mentioned as such by fo∣reigners and by Lowland writers Every one who has even travelled in Scotland must have seen at one glance that the Highlanders are of as different a race from the Lowlanders as the Old Welch from the English or the Old Bretons from  the people of Normandy Their hilly habitation alone could not occasion this difference for the inhabitants of the Alps Apennines Pyrenees mountains in the north of England and in Ire∣land Carpathian mountains c c c differ not from those in the plains And it is in the west of Ireland the most champain part of that iland that the old Irish are now found in their primitive savageness Nor is Bretagne a moun∣tainous country Had the Celtic part of our countrymen been in the eastern plains the case would have been the same as the Fins for in∣stance are in a plain country while the Norwe∣gians are in western mountains just similar to our Highlands Had these Norwegians been general inhabitants in the Highlands of Scotland with such superior harbours and opportunities these Highlands would now be as full of towns and commerce as Norway is But our Highland po∣pulation appears from the comparison to be too truly Celtic and the Gothic mixture has lost all effect as a generous liquor will when mixt with one of baleful quality The people of the Ork∣neys are pure Goths and are so much superior to those of the Hebudes that Kirkwall is one of the most polished places in Britain Stornoway the only town in the Celtic part of Scotland was founded by the Dutch and is now gone to ruin In vain would we excite industry among savages the point is to colonize the country afresh  Ancient monuments of the British Scots there are none save cairns of stones used as sepulchres and as memorials These were adapted to Celtic indolence while the Gothic industry raised vast stones instead of piling small ones nor are any cairns found in Gothic countries so far as i can learn except such as are very large The Celtic churches houses c were all of wattles as are the barns at this day in the Hebudes so that no ruins can be found of them The early cathedral  of Hyona must have been of this sort and it was burnt by the Danes in the ninth century The present ruin is not older than the thirteenth In the twelfth century Saint Bernard represents a stone church as quite a novelty even in Ireland  As to the language of the Dalriads the only difference between it and the Irish at present is that the former has rather more Gothic words Anciently they were quite the same as indeed they are very nearly so now the difference not be∣ing so great as between the provincial dialects in England The old Gaelic like the modern was a totally different dialect of the Celtic from the old Welch as Beda sufficiently proves who marks them as different languages  The kingdom was hereditary but the brother was always esteemed a nearer heir than the son  O'Flaherty regards this succession as merely a guard against minorities He says Ogyg Vind p "Neither was there ever a minor king of Ireland being continually excluded by the law of succession" Fordun III says the uncles only ruled till the nephews came to majority but IV he allows that they reigned before them and i can find no instance of a regency  An infant king must indeed be a phaenomenon unknown to early kingdoms in which king and general are commonly synonymous According to Irish antiquaries the chief monarchy of Ireland was elective in a certain family and Mr O'Conor says the Dalriadic was so But it appears from the succession that the later kingdom was heredi∣tary and there is no proof of election The kingdom of Dalriada indeed differed radically from that of Ireland which consisted in a sove∣reignty over not less than twentyfive kinglets and the kinglet of Dalriada was one of them till Aidan's time It must therefore be compared not with the kingdom of Ireland but with it's petty royalties and was but the chiefship of a large clan For clans  Genera  or  Familiae  are primitive institutions and occur in the earliest  Irish periods and writers And their very essence implies hereditary government a mode used by different Gothic nations in the most ancient times The Pikish monarchy was confined to one royal race but it descended by the female not by the male line and the son of a king was always ex∣cluded while in Dalriada the case was in both points reversed Hence the Pikish strikes us as a mere elective monarchy the Dalriadic as heredi∣tary But the later ceased to be so before the kingdoms were united by Kenneth and it is even uncertain if Kenneth was of the Dalriadic race if not certain that he was of the Pikish so that neither the Dalriadic nor Pikish series can afford historic certainty of hereditary succession just before Alpin and Kenneth The line of Scotish kings must therefore in all events only com∣mence with Kenneth and to the Forty taken from the list by Innes Twentyeight must be added who tho they really existed had no more to do with the kingdom of present Scotland than the kings of Stratclyde And their hereditary succession totally fails more than a century before the reign of Kenneth so that even the name of Kenneth's grandfather cannot be recovered as above shewn  Let us close this chapter with a few hints con∣cerning Dalriadic manners Giraldus Cambrensis in his account of the Irish says most of them were cloathed in black wrappers as most of their sheep were black They used little  caputii  or hoods of plaid linen vests and trowsers The phillibeg is quite unknown to the Welch and Irish lan∣guage and manners The gaudiest ornament of the old Irish and Highlanders was the  fibula  or broach sometimes as large as a small plater of gold silver or brass ornamented with precious stones With it the plaid was fastened at the breast and sometimes a smaller broach within the large one fastened the plaid while the later was  only ornamental The dress of old Irish kings as appears from monuments was a close vest long trowsers down to the ancle and a long loose robe over all that reached to the ground was brought over the shoulders and fastened on the breast by a very large clasp or broch  Collectanea de Reb Hib N  o  XI  This dress is abso∣lutely Gothic The primitive Celtic dress was only a skin thrown over the shoulder and a piece of cloth tied round the middle Gildas mentions the last as the dress of the Scots or Irish in his time  The Irish armies consisted entirely of infantry but laterly of two kinds The  Galloglachs  were heavy armed with helmet and coat of mall long swords and pollaxes The  Keherns  were light in∣fantry with javelins and short daggers called  skeyns  The pollax was peculiarly common in Ireland in the time of Giraldus and was always carried in the hand as a staff Their ferocity in war was great and prompted the ancient but false accusation that they ate human food Dio∣dorus Siculus the first who mentions this also imputes the same practice to the German Gauls on the Rhine But as Tacitus and other better informed writers found the later false so the falsehood of the former would have appeared as is reasonable to infer had any Roman writer really visited Ireland Strabo and others continue this charge Saint Jerome is it is believed the last and he imputes it to the Attacotti It is cer∣tain that human sacrifices were used among the early Goths as they were in Greece and Rome and as the later nations are great part of the common sacrifices it was natural for them to con∣clude that the same practice prevailed among other nations But it was not so for the human carcases were hung up in the holy grove This however seems the real origin of the fiction The  Attacottic feasts were more innocent and consisted chiefly of venison and other game Their drink i do not find much illustrated Ale they could not have without agriculture Ireland was always famous for bees and mead would be a common liquor of course The poor would as now use buttermilk As to  usquebaugh  or  aqua vitae  i agree with Ware that it is of late times The Sarmatic distillation from corrupted milk could not be known in Ireland nor had they mares enough to procure it To the Germans and other Goths it was unknown Nor could the Irish distill from oats while agriculture was hardly in use In the mountains of Argyle there was no room for agriculture and wine was surely unknown as there was no commerce When whisky became known in the Highlands perhaps three centuries ago it was as it is now in poor houses there drunk out of shells instead of li∣queur glasses These whiskyshells the learned fa∣bricator of Ossian makes very ancient and his heroes at the  feast of shells  or whiskyfeast enjoy themselves in potations of half a gill a piece while the naughty Germans were emptying quart horns  The shells are small scallopshells and in drinking the ball of the thumb is placed on the hinge part They are only used as liqueur glasses for whisky    As Aidan and Columba protected the Irish bards at the council of Drumkeat there is reason to think that not a few of them must have re∣paired to Dalriada The following story occurs in Adomnan's life of Columba written about the year  Lib I c edit Messingham  'Another time when the saint was sitting at the lake Kei near the mouth of the river which in Latin is  Bos  Damh with the bre∣thren an Irish poet came up to them and after some conversation departed Upon which the brethren said to the saint Why did you allow  Coronan to depart without asking him to sing us some song in modulation according to the cus∣tom of his art To which the saint answered Why do you speak useless words How could I ask a song of gladness from that miserable wretch who at this moment slain by his enemies stood then at the end of his life The saint had no sooner spoken than a man called from the other side of the river saying That poet who just left you in safety is slain in his journey by enemies Then all who were present looked at each other in great amazement' The place of this scene i cannot ascertain but it affords a strong specimen of the savage ferocity of the age Upon the con∣struction of the old Celtic poetry we want much information Most of it was accompanied with music Giraldus Cambrensis informs us that the instruments in Ireland were the harp and the ta∣bor in Scotland the harp tabor and  chorus  Chorus instrumentum musicae  Girald Camb  Et  in Vet Test Septuagint in Vulgato chorus So Du Cange but the form of the chorus i find not  in Wales the harp pipes and chorus and that Scotland was in his time the most eminent for music An ancient Irish harp yet preserved is thirtytwo inches high the soundboard is of oak the rest of red sally richly adorned with sil∣ver  Walker's Irish Bards  Giraldus tells us that the Irish preferred wire to leather for stringing of harps The bagpipe was a Roman instrument as formerly shewn but seems of modern use among our Highlanders  PART V Piks and Dalriads united  PART V  Piks and Dalriads united  CHAPTER I  Union of the Piks and Dalriads  AT length we arrive at a period of Scotish history which may reasonably be expected to be more clear than the preceding namely that from till Our whole history may be divided into Four Periods  The Roman pe∣riod which reaches from the earliest accounts to the beginning of the Fifth century In this part the facts are clear and certain but few  The Pikish period beginning at the reign of Drust the Great and extending to that of Ken∣neth On this period Adomnan Beda Tig∣hernac c throw much light  The Middle  Period from till  The Clear Pe∣riod from till the Union of England and Scotland  The Third Period on which we now enter might be expected to be clearer than the two pre∣ceding and yet i question much if this be the case Far from the classic light which is thrown on the first part by Tacitus and others there is not even an Adomnan or a Beda and the Irish writers wholly occupied with the miseries of their own country occasioned by the Northern invaders hardly mark now and then the death of a king of North Britain In Scotland itself not a native writer arose till the thirteenth century and their brief accounts are perverted with gross traditional fable For these reasons i rather in∣cline to regard this Third Period as the most obscure of Scotish history and as a dark night just before the day of our Clear Period In∣deed over all Europe as is well known the ninth and tenth centuries form the deepest night be∣tween ancient and modern day In the eighth century the former fails and in the eleventh a new morning arises and authentic writers appear in most countries  Unfortunately the most important event in the ancient history of Scotland took place in this darkest night namely the Union of the Piks and Dalriads Concerning this great event upon which our whole history turns we have no information till two centuries after when accounts palpably fabulous and absurd began to be blindly followed by old writers So that the night is not only dark but haunted with spectres of fiction and i am tempted to exclaim with Tasso  Degne d'un chiaro sol degne d'un pieno  Teatro opre sarian si memorande  Notte che nel profondo oscuro seno  Chiudesti e ne l'oblio fatto si grande  Piacciati ch'io ne'l tragga e'n bel sereno  A le future eta lo spieghi e mande  Viva la fama loro e tra lor gloria  Splenda del fosco tuo l'alta memoria  The great importance and thick obscurity of this event render all the powers of industry and sagacity necessary to investigate it and yet none of our antiquaries has yet lent it any examina∣tion I am therefore induced to treat it with the minuteness and prolixity of a special dissertation The late prevalence of the names  Scot  and  Scot∣land  as the real source of the old fables so is the cause of their currency at this day Let us first examine those fables  In Chap IV of this Part where the causes of the new name of  Scotland  being given to North Britain are examined the reader will find reason to conclude that this appellation certainly un∣known till about the year or was im∣posed by the Irish monks and clergy the only literati whom the country then had A conse∣quence of this erroneous denomination was that apparently in the same century the same Irish churchmen began to fable that the Old Scots or Dalriads had vanquished the Piks This fable arose partly from the deep obscurity of the ninth and tenth centuries so universally felt over Europe but chiefly from the natural predilection of these churchmen for the colony of their coun∣trymen in North Britain It was indeed a natural and necessary consequence of the new name of  Scotia  the origin of which the reader will find in the chapter abovementioned  Of course it is not surprizing that in the  Chro∣nicon Pictorum  This piece is split into two by Innes p con∣trary to the MS See it in the Appendix to Vol I The first part must have been copied from ancient lists that after Kenneth seems original  we find the conquest of the Piks by Kenneth asserted That venerable piece ends  at the year and tho the years of Kenneth IV whom it closes with be left blank which might induce some to suppose it written in his reign yet it's closing words  Hic est qui c  "this is he who c" strongly imply that it was written some time after However there is every reason to conclude from intrinsic proofs and from it's antique and barbaric manner so dissimilar to our fragments of the twelfth century that the conclu∣sion of it was certainly written in the eleventh and probably in the reign of Malcom II This piece says  Pictavia autem a Pictis est nominata quos ut diximus Kinadius delevit  The words  ut diximus  refer to some sentence which does not appear in our copies but the author of this part sufficiently marks his opinion that Kenneth van∣quished the Piks  Delere  strictly means to de∣stroy but also signified in the middle ages to ra∣vage or to conquer Thus in the annals of Tig∣hernac at the year we find  Orcades deletae sunt a Bruide  This Pikish king did not as i humbly conceive root up and destroy the Ork∣neys but merely ravaged them It is clear however that the opinion that Kenneth vanquished the Piks is as old as the eleventh century and perhaps coaeval with the name of Scotland in North Britain But a gross fable may take root in far less time than two centuries which inter∣vened between Kenneth's time and the first ap∣pearance of this tale And older authorities soon to be produced prove it void of all foundation  Some parts of the Register of St Andrew's also published in the Appendix to vol I and written about the year as they bear likewise support the conquest of the Piks by Kenneth The Chroni∣cle N  o  IV ap Innes written in William's reign and other later pieces insinuate the same But extraneous writers pushed the fable to the greatest excess  Henry of Huntingdon was born before the year as appears from his own work  fol v    Saville Scriptores post Bedam Lond  where he narrates his father's death at that year His history closes at the year and was apparently written then or before As William of Malmsbury is remarkable for be∣ing the best of the old English historians so Henry for being the worst Nicolson has well branded him as fabulous and confused and his work is rather a weak sermon than a history from his perversion of facts in order to draw common∣place morality from them It is superfluous to con∣firm this character by extracts from his history the reader is referred to a perusal of it as the surest proof He was the first English writer who adopted the fables of Geoffrey of Monmouth and his judgment is equally apparent in being the first writer whom i can discover to have men∣tioned the destruction of the Piks by some pre∣tended Scots for the fact is there was no people in Britain known by the name of Scots from about when the kingdom of the old Scots in Britain fell till about when the name of Scots was improperly given to the Piks as after shewn With his usual confusion Henry con∣founds the Old Scots of Beda with the Scots of his own time as if he had taken the Marcomanni of Tacitus for the Marcomanni of Rabanus Mau∣rus or the Hungarians for Huns In this view it struck him that the Piks had vanished and accordingly he says "the Piks seemed then so far extinct and their language so utterly destroyed that all that was recorded of them in ancient his∣tory appeared a mere fable"  Quinque autem linguis utitur Britannia Brittonum vide∣licet Anglorum Scottorum Pictorum et Latinorum quamvis Picti jam videantur deleti et lingua eorum ita om∣nino destructa ut jam fabula videatur quod in veterum scriptis eorum mentio invenitur Cui autem non comparet amorem coelestium et horrorem terrestrium si cogitet non solum reges eorum et principes et populum deperiisse verum etiam stirpem omnem et linguam et mentionem simul defecisse Et si de aliis mirum non esset de lingua tamen quam unam inter caeteras Deus ab exordio linguarum instituit mirandum videtur  lib    f v  It is surprizing to find the learned Du Cange Praef ad Gloss ed Adelung apply this passage to the  English  After the word  eorum  he in∣serts  Anglorum  Accuracy  And adds on the  occasion a sage reflection upon the instability of human glory which reflection he seems to have wanted an occasion to make and has thus in∣vented the occasion in order to make his reflec∣tion striking Nor is he the only author who has sacrificed truth to eloquence and fact to period Instead of concluding that a nation might change it's name that a people called Piks three centu∣ries before might be called Scots in his time as the Gauls were termed Franks he rashly infers that a whole nation had vanished But his igno∣rance concerning the north of Britain is not won∣derful when we reflect on his ignorance concern∣ing his own country and it is not surprizing that he thought the Piks extinct who thought that William the Conqueror exterminated the English  Perficit dominator Dominus de gente Anglorum quod diu cogitaverat Genti namque Normannorum asperae et calidae tradidit eos ad exterminandum  Lib  VII  f v    Such is the original fountain of this wondrous tale  The story however thus darkly surmized at first was like other falsehoods soon to acquire circumstances in order to make it tell well  Giraldus Cambrensis wrote about and preceding this epoch there is no mention to be found of the Pikish and Dalriadic union nor is there indeed the smallest fragment or scrap exist∣ing of Dalriadic history except the Duan which gives no hint on this subject save that it tacks Kenneth to the list of Dalriadic kings and that he was king of the Dalriads as well as of the  Piks is undoubted But as it mentions the Pikish line to have closed in Constantin which is demonstrably false no dependence can be placed on the Gaelic bard's knowlege of the Pikish kingdom nor in course of the great event now treated Yet he mentions no conquest of the Piks by the Dalriads so that he was a stranger to the fables about to be considered The words of Gi∣raldus in his  Topographia Hiberniae  lib III c after speaking of St Patrick's arrival in Ireland in Leogaire son of Nell being king of Ireland are as follow  Hic quoque notandum videtur prae∣dicto Nello Hiberniae monarchiam obtinente sex filios Muredi Regis Ultoniae in classe non modica Boreales Britanniae partes occupasse Unde et gens ab iis pro∣pagata et specificato vocabulo Scotica vocata usque in hodiernum angulum illum inhabitant Sed quibus ex causis buc advenerint qualiterque et quantis pro∣ditionibus potius quam expeditionibus Pictorum gen∣tem pervalidam armis quoque et animositate longe praestantem a partibus illis expulerunt cum notabi∣lem illam Britanniae Topographiam declaravimus enu∣cleatius expedietur  "Here it is worthy of remark that in the reign of the said Nell king of Ireland six sons of Mured king of Ulster with not a small fleet occupied the north parts of Britain Whence their progeny by a special name called Scots inhabit that corner to this day But for what causes they came here and by what treasons rather than expeditions they expelled the Piks a nation most powerful in arms and far superior in courage from these parts shall be more fully explained when we publish that notable Topogra∣phy of Britain" This Topography never ap∣peared or at least cannot be found tho long and anxiously sought after by many But the above hint was sufficient for those Scotish writers who were afterward to commence authors of our history with small talents for such an impor∣tant office to narrate in solemn terms the  conquest of the Piks by the Dalriads are pretended Scots For in those times the few Scotish writers always followed and imitated the English as few or no other manuscripts then found their way into Scotland Thus Fordun and Winton follow the Polycronicon in plan and the Regiam Majestatem is a mere exscript of Glan∣ville Geoffrey of Monmouth furnished Fordun with half his fables William of Malmsbury and Henry of Huntingdon are also familiar to For∣dun who puts from the last the total destruction of the Piks tho he blends it also with the later fables of Giraldus And this very work and pas∣sage of Giraldus is referred to by Fordun lib I c for the origin of the name  Scotia  But let the passage itself declare how worthy he was of belief In his account of Irish history he shews the grossest ignorance and in this hint of Scotish the whole is one blunder The settle∣ment of the six sons of Mured in the reign of Nell father of Leogaire or about the year is unknown to every Irish and Scotish monument of history to Beda Nennius c Beda directly confutes it by marking Reuda as the first leader of the Old Scots from Ireland and no one can hesitate to stamp it an arrant fiction Giraldus calls that part of Britain north of Forth and Clyde a corner tho it be six or eight times the size of all Wales his country put together If he means Dalriada or Argyleshire that is indeed a corner but a corner nearly as large as Wales There was not even a king of Ulster till the eleventh century as appears from Tighernac and other ancient Irish writers But it is clear that he wrote this in a total ignorance both of the country and of it's history and if he be the author of the  Descriptio Albaniae  it must have been written after this and he profited as that  Descriptio  says it's author did by the advice of Andrew bishop of Caithness in both points for he there with as risible excess  divides this  corner  into seven kingdoms and only says modestly Kenneth  in Pictinia regnavit  'reigned in Pikland' without one hint of con∣quest  Meantime the fiction thrived in England Roger of Chester wrote his Polychronicon about which is imputed to Higden the plagiary of it In an excellent MS of that work containing pas∣sages not found in other MSS and which bears the name of Roger of Chester and is written about  In Bibl Harl No  it is said that the Scots invited the chiefs of the Piks to an entertainment and slew them by base treachery It is added  Sicque de duobus populis gens bellicosior totaliter evanuit  A strange affair that because it's chiefs were slain a whole nation should  totally vanish  Well does O'Fla∣herty laugh at this total extinction for it tran∣scends any thing in Irish fable Need we a stronger proof that this period of our history is the most obscure of all Is there so gross a fable in the Roman or Pikish periods  Fordun followed and from him this fable passed to all our historians to this day He in speaking of Kenneth's conquest of the Piks  lib  IV  c  and almost using the words of Henry of Huntingdon whom he quotes says  Sic quidem non solum reges et duces gentis illius deleti sunt ve∣rum etiam stirps et genus adeo cum idiomatis sui lin∣gua defecisse legitur ut quicquid ex eis veterum re∣peritur in scriptis fictum fabula aut apogryphum a plerisque credatur  'So indeed not only the kings and chiefs of that nation were destroyed but likewise the stem and progeny language and idiom so totally failed as we read that whatever is found concerning them in the writ∣ings of the ancients is believed by most to be feigned fabulous or apocryphal'  Bravissimo  Does not this confirm the aphorism formerly  given WHEN FALSEHOOD IS RECEIVED AS TRUTH THE OPPOSITE TRUTH MUST OF ABSOLUTE NECESSITY PASS FOR FALSEHOOD The names  Scot  and  Scot∣land  had totally turned the brains of Fordun who was himself as O'Flaherty justly observes a Pik Yet he spares no falsehood to destroy the honour of the Piks and to assert that of the pre∣tended Scots Can human madness proceed to a greater height What are human affairs when one name one word can pervert the integrity and common sense of the writers of a whole na∣tion for five centuries Fordun has exerted all his little powers of fiction to adorn the catastrophe of the Piks Kenneth uses a most sagacious strata∣gem to encourage his chiefs to this great con∣quest by dressing a man with luminous skins of fish who with the voice of an angel denounces vengeance on the Piks But enough of this childish fable  Happily more ancient and purer sources re∣main from which it is clear that this very Ken∣neth was king of the Piks That the name of Scots was not extended to the inhabitants of North Britain till about in the reign of Malcom II whose predecessors are called kings of the Piks That Kenneth far from conquering or ex∣tirpating the Piks was a monarch of their own royal stem and if he conquered any nation it must have been the Old Scots of Dalriada These matters may appear strange as indeed truth must to those accustomed to falsehood but as truth is in it's nature directly opposite to falsehood and it is certain that Kenneth did not conquer the Piks but was their own proper sovereign a can∣did mind will naturally conclude that the truth of this matter is the very reverse of it's falsehood in every point and that of course Kenneth king of the Piks conquered the Dalriads Were i to embrace this other extreme side of the question i would argue thus  The name of Scotland not being given to North Britain till about as after shewn that is near two dark centuries after Kenneth it is out of the question The Irish churchmen re∣ceiving more and more encouragement as Chris∣tianity advanced in Pikland where learning was unknown among the natives till a late period the thirteenth century might easily occasion this perversion of our history by ascribing to their countrymen the Old Scots of Dalriada what was really due to the Piks The later had preserved the memory of their Scythic extraction as appears from the  Chronicon Pictorum  published by Innes and as  Scot  was but another term for  Scythian  as above shewn the name with more propriety belonged to the Piks than to the Dalriads In the time of Adomnan and Beda the later were alone called Scots of Britain but this was before any due knowlege was had of the Piks or of the Scy∣thic origin of the first Scots As more informa∣tion was got the name of Scythians or Scots was found to belong to both nations and was with great propriety given to both Thus the word  Scotti Britanniae  which in Beda's time im∣plied only the Dalreudini in the eleventh cen∣tury included the Piks nay chiefly denoted them as they were indeed real Scots or Scythians while the Dalreudini were more than half Celts and spoke the Celtic tongue But they who gave the generic name of Scots to the Piks did not reflect on the confusion this novelty must occasion while by retaining the old names all would have been clear In the twelfth century as we learn from many English cotemporary writers the name of Piks was restricted to the people of Galloway who having been separated from the Pikish kingdom by that of Stratclyde lying be∣tween had their own lords and retained the Pikish name Now it is clear that the Piks against whom Alpin and his son Kenneth fought  were those of Galloway only The tales of For∣dun invented by himself deserve no notice and his falsehood is now too well known to meet with any The Register of the Priory of St Andrew's one of the oldest monuments of our history says  Alpin occisus est in Gallewathia postquam eam peni∣tus destruxit et devastavit Et hinc translatum est regnum Scotorum in regnum Pictorum  The Pikish kingdom was on the north and east of Dalriada and not in Galloway This is the origin of the fable concerning the battles of Kenneth against the Piks Kenneth was natural sovereign of the Pikish kingdom but wanted to subdue the Gal∣wegians to it and it happened afterward that the Galwegians were peculiarly termed Piks af∣ter that name had ceased in the real Pikish king∣dom Thus the fable can be traced even to it's source and the distinction between Piks and Scots became in this darkest period of our his∣tory totally different from what is commonly supposed  That the language of the Scotti the Irish pre∣vailed in Scotland after the time of Kenneth there is not a shadow of proof The extension of the Highlanders and of their speech seem to be∣long to the times when the Norwegians drove them from the Hebudes and western coast They also naturally spred into the north of Scot∣land after the Norwegian power failed there be∣ing the nearest inhabitants and adapted by na∣ture and customs to mountainous and barren re∣gions Their speech had indeed a great advan∣tage over the Pikish in being a written and cul∣tivated language since the time of St Patrick while Ninian and Columba the apostles of the Piks most unfortunately totally neglected to teach them to write their own language But as there is not a shadow of proof that the Irish tongue ever was at all used in the Lowlands of Scotland it is needless to insist further upon this  The question then remains entire whether the union of the Piks and Dalriads falsely called Scots was not effected by a complete conquest of the later by the former under Kenneth their own proper king Tighernac and Caradoc of Llancarvon who wrote a century after Tigher∣nac or about mark the death of Kenneth simply as king of the Piks just as they state the death of Kenneth I son of Luthrin or of any other Pikish kings The title of king of the Piks continues that of king of Dalriada or of the Old British Scots is extinct Would not plain sense argue from this that the Piks had conquered the Dalriads The history of the later after their conquest by Ungust becomes more and more obscure till it is totally extin∣guished That of the Piks is more and more known The Irish writers would naturally favour the Dalriads yet it is from them that these cir∣cumstances fully appear In common argument  a probabili  that the Piks vanquished the Dalriads is rational that the Dalriads should conquer the Pikish kingdom especially at a time when the former were so reduced and the later so powerful is absurd and impossible The Danes ravage the Dalriads with impunity no king no army ap∣pears against them In Pikland there are great battles and the Danes gain no footing The Norwegians about seize most of the territo∣ries of the Dalriads and hold them for near four centuries In the north of Pikland they effect a settlement but the Pikish power gains as much on the south as it loses on the north and gains fertile plains while it yields barren mountains In short upon every principle of historic autho∣rity and of argument if the sole question were whether the Piks conquered the Dalriads or the contrary there is no room to hesitate in saying that the truth is directly opposite to our Celtic fa∣bles  and that the Piks conquered the Dalriads Nor would this Celtic perversion of history want example in Welch or in Irish history Had not Gildas and Beda remained Arthur's conquest of England might be still believed tho the poor fa∣thers of the fable be confined to a few mountains The victories of the Gael over the Firbolg in Irish history are of the same class and these Cel∣tic fablers make the former the Scotti while the later are the Scotti As it is to Highland sena∣chies and Irish churchmen that we owe the con∣quest of the Piks by the Dalriads there is per∣fect analogy in the case and every room to infer that the usual perversion of Celtic understanding has taken place and that the truth is the direct reverse  But it may be said there are two arguments to be drawn from the old lists of our kings against this account  The succession after Kenneth becomes hereditary  The Pikish Brudis Drusts c cease and new names appear  To the first of these arguments it is answered that the Pikish succession became hereditary before Kenneth as Drust IX son of Constantin and Uven son of Ungust II came to the crown after their fathers as formerly explained in the Chapter of Pikish kings And the succession of these is absolutely similar to that after Kenneth for first Ungust II brother of Constantin succeeds then Drust IX son of Constantin  To the second it is answered that as the names after Kenneth are not the usual Pikish names so neither are they the usual Dalriadic The names of Kenneth and of Alpin his father are Pikish not Dalriadic  Conad  Keir our writers call  Kenneth  Keir but  Conad  is not  Kenneth  as Irish antiquaries justly observe But the d king of the Piks was  Kenneth  son of Luthrin A D and the th  Kenneth  son of Wir∣dech A D by Hoveden called  Cynoth  as  the Latin C is always to be pronounced K as it was in the early and in the middle ages  Ruric and  Kinaf  were the Scandinavian founders of the Russian empire in Russia  th  is pronounced  f  as Feodor for Theodor c so that  Kinath  is the real name  Alpin  or  El∣pin  is the name of a moneyer on Hardeknute's coins  El∣phin  was bishop of Winchester in Edgar's reign Malmsb de Gest Pont Saxon names beginning with  Ken  are numerous as  Kenulf Kenelm Kenred  c The names of Kenneth and his father are purely Gothic  Of the other seventeen kings down to Malcom III there are two Donals three Constantins two Malcoms Others are Ed Grig Indulf Odo called Duffodo or Black Odo and hence by error Duff Culen Grim Duncan Macbeth Lulach That we are indebted for the history of this period to Irish churchmen bards and sena∣chies who had all the little learning then known in Pikland is too certain and hence Irish epi∣thets Yet these names are not Irish tho if some were foreign causes might occasion them For the churchmen who were Irish might by per∣mission of the parents give Irish names Some of the kings might be married to Irish ladies and the mothers or their relations impose the names Irish names might become fashionable among the Piks as the former were the learned people and their language cultivated so Greek names became common in Russia tho the Russians be not Greeks Lastly the Irish churchmen and bards might as usual in the Celtic language change the names to a Celtic semblance These causes considered there would be little reason to wonder that the Pikish kings of this period after the Dalriads were united with the Piks should vary a little in their names But there is no need of these arguments here for after all the names are much more Pikish than Irish or Dal∣riadic  Donel  was father of Garnad th king of the Piks and the name Domnail or Donald is Gothic as indeed most Irish names of kings  are Domald was one of the ancient kings of Sweden The  Constantins  are Pikish the first Constantin king of the Piks in is well known  Ed  seems the Pikish Wid  Grig Indulf Odo Culen Grim  are all Gothic names direct and without Celtic vitiation Thus only four names remain  Malcom Duncan Macbeth Lulach  The former is surely Pikish Brudi the well∣known Pikish king being son of  Mailcon  as for Celtic etymologies from Columba c they are dreams  Mal  is Gothic  speech konr a man  so that the word seems to imply an  eloquent man  or perhaps a leader who directs the army by his words of command There is no Malcom in the Irish or Dalriadic lists and there is in the Pikish  Duncan  is the  only  name to be found in Dalriadic story where is a Duncan Beg king of Cantire The Irish name is really Donchadh pronounced Donca sometimes latinized Doncadius Simeon of Durham who wrote about calls our name Duncan  Dunecanus  and there is room to believe that this name is not the Irish Donchadh tho the Highland senachies confounded them  Dun  is Gothic  a fort  It also means  clamor  as our  din Duncan  may therefore mean  strong voice  a necessary matter in a barbaric leader    kan possum valeo  and no Irish etymology can come so near and there is no proof that the name is Irish As for the two remaining  Macbeth  and  Lulach  the former is commonly supposed no name at all as it signi∣fies only the son of Beth The  Mac  now used was never anciently part of a fixt name till surnames arose in the eleventh century but they did not reach Scotland till after the time of Malcom III Our old writers call this king  Macbeda  and  Beth Bed Beda  are well known Angogothic names The Highland senachies seem in scorn of this usurper to have omitted his name and to have called him the son of Beth son of Finleg Old  English writers call him  Macbetad  and i question if his name be not  Maheth  or if the  mac  prefixt be not a fall of letters not implying the Irish  mac  The  mac  may be found in Gothic nay in Latin names as Macrinus Macrobius and i have heard of the later's being taken for a Scotish name What seems to confirm that Macbeth does not mean son of Beth is that his father was Finleg and he is called  Macbeth filius Finleg  in our old lists Now the grandfather's name is never put in these lists and there seems no room to believe it the case here In the Duan Mac∣beth is called absolutely the son of Finleg and his name not put at his own reign As to Lu∣lach his name is not found in the Celtic and if it were may be found in the Gothic Thus tho to grant some of these names Celtic would not injure the question there is no occasion even for that conces∣sion  Upon the whole as the Irish churchmen and bards had after the union of the Piks and Dal∣riads all the little learning of Pikland and totally perverted it's history to their own fables there is great room to believe that in spite of all these fables the Piks really conquered the Dalriads and that the royal line continued Pikish as did by far the most numerous but unhappily the unlearned part of the people As for the name of  Scots  and  Scotland  if we even granted them to originate in Pikland from the Dalriads this al∣lowance would not imply either conquest or su∣periority in numbers For the Angli tho finally vanquished by the Saxons and always far inferior to them in number yet gave name to England  So much for the two extremities of this ques∣tion namely whether the Dalriads conquered the Piks or the Piks the Dalriads But neither of these extreme views seems true and there are medial views next to be considered which have a juster claim to attention Let us first consider the most ancient authorities on the matter  Nennius as is well known from different chronological calculations in his work wrote in Samuel who made additions to it was his friend and cotemporary and the authority of both is equal An authority nearer the time can∣not be expected His words ch are  Post in∣tervallum annorum multorum non minus  DCCCC  Picti venerunt et occupaverunt insulas quae Orcades vocantur Et postea ex insulis affinitimis vastave∣runt non modicas et multas regiones occupaveruntque eas in sinistrali plaga Britanniae et manent usque in hodiernum diem Ibi tertiam partem Britanniae te∣nuerunt et tenent usque nunc  "After an interval of many not less than years the Piks came and seized the ilands called Orkneys And after∣ward from the neighbouring iles wasted several not small regions and seized those in the north part of Britain and remain to this day They held the THIRD part of Britain and hold it now" No testimony can be more explicit than this Had the Dalriads conquered the Piks could so great an event have escaped the notice of Nennius living at the very time Far from this he rather witnesses that the Piks had vanquished the Dal∣riads for he mentions the former as lords of the northern THIRD of Britain a term of division al∣most too large for Scotland In another place Nennius speaking of the Orkneys says they are beyond the Piks so that the Piks retained all their possessions in the time of Nennius  King Alfred reigned from till In his translations of Beda and Orosius he uses a paraphrastic plan and makes additions of his own The Piks he frequently mentions by the names of  Pehtar Pihtar Pyhtar Peohtar  but drops not one hint of any alteration in their condition This silence is surely important if not conclusive for so memorable an event as their conquest could not have escaped the king  Asser wrote his life of Alfred about the same time and he mentions the Danes as ravag∣ing the Piks in but says nothing of any new sovereignty in Pikland  The Saxon Chronicle was written in the tenth and eleventh century It mentions the Piks in as Asser but has not a hint of any revolu∣tion in Pikland Ethelwerd and Ingulphus wri∣ters of the eleventh century mention the Piks especially as warring under Constantin their king in  Tighernac wrote about and has pre∣served many particulars concerning the Piks and Dalriads The kings of the former he chronicles minutely and exactly but is quite silent as to any revolution in Kenneth's time On the con∣trary he mentions the death of Kenneth as 'king of the Piks' Surely as Innes justly observes had he conquered the Piks he would not have been called their king but king of Pikland But Tighernac marks his death in the very same words which he uses for all the other Pikish kings Nay Tighernac calls the successors of Kenneth down to Donald who died kings of the Piks always He says ' Donald M'Alpin king of the Piks died' ' Constantin M'Cinaoch rex Pictorum moritur' Donald the next he calls king of Albany  An old Irish translation of Nennius quoted by Lynch gives us a list of the kings of the Piks from Brudi son of Meilocon and goes on in constant succession to Malcom III and after making Kenneth son of Alpin succeed the last Brudi without one hint of any failure or new line  The Welch writers are as ignorant of any revolution in Pikland as the English and Irish for Caradoc who wrote about marks the death of Kenneth simply as 'king of the Piks'  The Gaelic Duan gives no hint of any revo∣lution in Kenneth's time  Such are the genuine ancient authorities on this subject and from them two conclusions follow  That there was no conquest or remarkable revo∣lution in Pikland under Kenneth son of Alpin else it could not have escaped all writers of Eng∣land Ireland and Wales the three nearest coun∣tries  That these ancient authors clearly testify on the contrary that there was not by marking the Piks as in their old power in Kenneth's time and long after nay by putting Kenneth and his successors as really kings of the Piks  To op∣pose such late writers as Henry of Huntingdon and Giraldus to those early testimonies would be contrary to every rule of history  Yet unhappily not one of these authorities sheds any light on the nature of Kenneth's succes∣sion The Duan and our old lists together with the regular inheritance after his time seem to im∣ply that there must have been some novelty Per∣haps prejudice may still cling around me but i must confess that i am not bold enough to say that there was no change under Kenneth So much smoke raises a suspicion of some fire As a Greek grammarian wished to raise the ghost of Homer in order to learn the place of that poet's birth i would desire to evocate the shade of Ken∣neth that i might enquire how he came to the Pikish throne But let us use the means in our power to arrive at the highest probability if not the truth of this event  There are so far as i recollect four ways in which a crown may be gained  By inheritance  By conquest  By election  By usurpa∣tion The three later ways seem here out of the question  That there was no conquest has been shewn above Had Kenneth been elected it is hard to account for his establishing the inheritance in his race and election as above shewn had cer∣tainly  ceased in Pikland before Kenneth's time For usurpation we have no authority nor even cause of suspicion Kenneth was the son of Al∣pin a king and i know no example of usurpation so firm in the race of the usurper and void of competition nor is there one hint in Tighernac or other early authors of any victory over the lawful king There is therefore reason to infer that Kenneth became king of Pikland by inherit∣ance  Allowing this only three questions can in ap∣pearance arise on the subject  If Kenneth was originally and merely king of the Piks and had no connexion with the Dalriads  If he was of the old Dalriadic line of kings of the Scotish or Irish stem and heir of Pikland by the female line  If he was of a new Dalriadic line of Pik∣ish extract and claimed the Pikish throne by right of inheritance  If Kenneth was merely and solely king of the Piks it is hard if not impossible to account for the old lists placing a remarkable revolution in his time The Duan and other pieces put him in the Dalriadic series Tighernac Caradoc the Irish translator of Nennius c put him in the Pikish Nothing is more certain in our his∣tory than that the kingdoms of Pikland and Dal∣riada were united in his person With all due contempt for Celtic perversion it seems violent to offer such outrage to all our old fragments of history as to say that Kenneth was merely king of the Piks and that no revolution happened in Pikland in his time  That Kenneth was not of the Dalriadic Old Scotish or Irish line has been shewn above The poor falsifications used to connect him with that line sufficiently prove to a candid enquirer that he did not belong to it The Irish Annals certainly not biassed against such a matter afford convincing proofs against the supposition The  Gaelic Duan written in the eleventh century marks all the kings from Fergus and Loarn to Malcom III as of the race of Erc This only shews that the Highland senachies had used the common Celtic skill in fabricating genealo∣gies and that the elapse of two dark centuries had encouraged their usual perversion of history The Piks a warlike and illiterate people were taught by Irish churchmen to venerate their learn∣ing The new name of Scots imposed before the Piks had any literature among them and the name of Piks restricted to the inimical Galwegi∣ans made the old Piks despise and abolish the memory of their own power Perhaps the Piks had quite different genealogies before the new name of Scots turned their own sword against their own breast and made them fight for the su∣periority of the Old Scots their nominal ances∣tors Such frenzy also occurred in French and English history and prevails in it's highest rage at this day in the Scotish But who is now so weak as to regard a Celtic genealogy as history A Celtic senachy would build a genealogy of the Pope or the Great Mogul up to Milesius nay to Adam and beyond  stans pede in uno  What can indeed be easier than to make a list of names With other nations a lineal descent fails in a few centuries but with the Celts it endures for ever There cannot be a stronger proof of Celtic capa∣city than their fondness for genealogy a science unknown to or despised by all other nations  Except the Greenlanders who as Crantz informs can all repeat their genealogies for several generations In the curious MS lives of Welch saints Cotton lib Vesp A XIV of the th or th cent is a diverting specimen of genuine ancient Celtic genealogies St Cadoc is descended from Au∣gustus thus Augustus  genuit  Octavianum qui g Tiberium q g Gaium q g Claudium q g VespasianumNero g Trajanum Trajanus g Hadrianum c The reader may rest assured that the others are of the same stamp tho not so easily convincible of falsehood    and when protracted of such notorious uncertainty and falsehood as to disgust every sound mind It is well known what toil and industry it has cost men of real learning to detail a genealogy of the first imperial and royal houses in Europe even up to the twelfth century how then lend any faith to an ignorant Celtic senachy utterly a stranger to truth and history O'Flaherty has been forced to cut and mangle the Irish genealogies at plea∣sure because the generations were too numerous that is the genealogy was false for a defect in one link destroys the whole chain at once But to insist on this would be to insult the reader's good sense so let us leave Celtic genealogies to Celtic understandings From Tighernac and other au∣thentic writers we know that the Irish genealogy of our kings is false and absurd as has been shewn above and that the name of Kenneth's grandfather is lost beyond redemption From Tighernac and the Annals of Ulster we learn who were the latest kings of the race of Erc both in Argyle and Lorn and know to a cer∣tainty that Kenneth did not belong to that gene∣alogy at all  After long and mature consideration of the present subject and revolving it in every point of view as it's radical importance to our history deserved i am convinced that the affirmative of the third question can alone solve every difficulty and bear every weight of historic truth namely That Kenneth was of a new Dalriadic line of Pikish extract and gained the Pikish crown by inheritance To confirm this the following co∣gent arguments arise  In mere theory this opinion is the most probable as it is a medial one between two extremes above considered namely that Kenneth was merely king of the Piks and that he was of the old Dalriadic race Now tho it be true that truth is one extreme and  falsehood another and a medial opinion may abstractly considered be thought to be neither true nor false yet in human testimony there is generally such a mixture of falsehood in truth and of truth in falsehood that the medial point has always been considered as that of truth wisdom and virtue  Medio tutissimus ibis  is a maxim ap∣plicable to history as well as to life and has been followed in doubtful points by most writers of wisdom and moderation  But to pass from theory to facts we know as above stated that Ungust king of the Piks totally conquered Dal∣riada and put its princes in chains about the year And we know that after this neither the house of Lorn nor that of Argyle held the scep∣tre of Dalriada but that a new house succeeded inferrable to be Pikish by every reason  Even supposing that Ed Fin was not of Pikish race there are no less than eight other kings from Ed Fin to Alpin whose genealogy we know nothing of and not to dwell on the others it is certain that Alpin and Kenneth are Pikish regal names and not Dalriadic so that there is reason to infer that Kenneth are his father at least were Pikish kings of Dalriada  This plain account solves the various information we have concerning Ken∣neth some ancient writers calling him king of the Piks while others put him in the Dalriadic line Allow him to have been originally king of the Dalriads and all is easy Alpin and he had as is most likely received the Dalriadic sceptre in hereditary succession from Ed Fin Pikish monarch of Dalriada The right which Kenneth had to the Pikish crown is indeed obscure for as to our mo∣dern tale of Fergusia daughter or as some more chronologically cook it sister of Ungust II king of the Piks being wedded to Achy father of Alpin it is a mere romance of that king of forgers Hec∣tor Boyce The very name  Fergusia  speaks this  and  that  Achy never existed as fully shewn above In Uwen or in Irish Eogan pro∣nounce Oan son of Ungust II king of the Piks by inheritance died It would seem that on the death of Uwen two competitors arose for the Pikish crown Alpin the Dalriadic king and Vered but that the later carried it That Vered dying in Kenneth asserted his claim his father Alpin being dead in and deposing Brudi son of Vered assumed the sceptre There was no national dispute between the Dalriads and the Piks Kenneth had no doubt a strong party in Pikland and the advantages of uniting the kingdoms must have been very apparent even in a rude age The English heptarchies had been partly united by Egbert twenty years before this and the new invasions of the Danes called for the united force of Caledonia to oppose them What was the claim of Alpin and that of Vered it is impossible to discover but both were palpably hereditary for the sons of both succeeded in Pikland now an hereditary kingdom Had this been a national war the Dalriads could have done nothing declining for three centuries as they had been and utterly vanquished in But they would naturally assist Kenneth and the favour which he and his nearer successors shewed them was natural The constant hereditary form of their govern∣ment must have rendered them subjects more to be trusted by the kings of Pikland in which state that form of succession was new and not fixt on constant use and the proscription of ages Kenneth and his ancestors as kings of Dalriada apparently used the Irish language and the churchmen of Pikland were almost all Irish so that the Irish may have been long the fashionable language as the French in England after the Norman conquest The Irish was then indeed  far superior to the Pikish as being a written and of course a more polished and exact lan∣guage  This plain and easy account of the Union of the Piks and Dalriads as it alone can reconcile all authorities bears every mark of historic truth  CHAPTER II  The Kings from    till    THE chronology of this period is sufficiently exact and easily adjusted by computing the number of years each king reigned according to the old lists and chronicles published by Innes from the fixt date of the accession of Kenneth to the Pikish throne or from the death of Macbeth which by unanimous consent of the ancient historians the Chronicle of Melrose c happened in Fordun dates the accession of Kenneth and has been blindly followed as usual by Boyce Buchanan c and as this perversion threw back the reign of Kenneth six years they have been forced to add these six years to the reign of Grig making him reign eighteen years while by our old lists he only reigned twelve But these and other smaller perversions did not deserve serious examination as they are confuted by the chronology of Pikish kings formerly given and by the following chronology compiled with minute attention and care  Tho the chronology of our kings during this period be as exact as that of any kingdom in Europe at the time yet the history is faint and obscure That of Kenneth and his eleven imme∣diate successors appears to best advantage being preserved in the brief but valuable  Chronicon Pic∣torum  published by Innes  And in the Appendix to vol I of this work to which volume it's greatest number of kings belongs  The other six kings  from Constantin IV to Malcom III or for a space of sixtyfour years are in more ob∣scurity A few faint rays are however to be found in the list N  o  IV published by Innes in that of the Register of Saint Andrew's N  o  V in the  Chro∣nicon Elegiacum  published at the end of the Chro∣nicle of Melrose  And in the App to this vol  and in the English and Islan∣dic writers As for Fordun Boyce Buchanan and their latest followers they are to be considered as mere fablers till the reign of Malcom III and cannot be founded on in the smallest particular before that period being generally contradictory of our old monuments and blend∣ing even their truth with such fables as obscure the light of history  The Dalriadic series tho hitherto built upon has as formerly shewn in this work no title to be regarded as that of the kings of North Britain The Pikish series has the sole claim to that dig∣nity Upon the accession of James VI to the English throne it would have been absurd to con∣sider his ancestors the Scotish kings as monarchs of England or to drop the history of England for that of Scotland and the case is the same here The reader upon recurring to the list of Pikish kings will find that the reign of Kenneth was the seventyseventh from the foundation of the Pikish monarchy Kings of the same name are numbered in the Pikish series thus there were two Kenneths kings of Pikland before the Dal∣riadic Kenneth and so in other names  KENNETH III A C reigned years in Pikland by all accounts He seems to have been a prince of considerable talents for the age and country He had ruled Dalriada two years when he ascended the Pikish throne  Ch Pict  In his seventh year he transported the reliques of St Columba hitherto kept in  Hyona to a new church which he built in Pik∣land  Ib  Invading the English territory six times he burned Dunbar and Melrose which had been usurped  Ib  or seized by the English or Danes of Northumbria But the Britons of Strat∣clyde burned Dulblaan and the Danes wasted Pikland to Cluanan and Dunkeld  Dulblaan is apparently Dumblain Cluanan Cluny above Dunkeld  In 'Maolmor Maclanirk daughter to Cinaoh Mac Al∣pin died'  Ann Ult  Ib  He died on the  feria tertia  or third day of the week Tuesday the ides or thirteenth of February  Ib  that is in after a reign of sixteen years and some months Tuesday was also the th Fe∣bruary in or six years before and Fordun c place his death in that year The Annals of Ulster say but as to our history they often antedate by three or four years thus Brudi's death is put instead of and so in the rest That was the real date is clear from the Pikish chronicle so valuable for exact coin∣cidence with the English writers in other mat∣ters and from the eclipse of the sun on the day of St Cyriacus aftermentioned Fordun's perversion of all chronology concerning Selvac c shews his dates put at random and that Tuesday should be the  th of February in is a mere chance and the six years deficient were forced to be added to the reign of Grig to make up the chronology tho our old lists give him but or not years Kenneth died in his palace at  Forthuirtabacht Ch Pict Fortheviot Ch Eleg  now Forteviot near the river Ern south of Perth the chief residence of the Pikish kings after their recovery of Lothian in Before that time as appears from Adomnan they resided near Inverness  DONAL I brother of Kenneth III A C reigned years by all accounts In his  time the Gaël or Dalriads obtained a confirma∣tion of the old laws assigned them by Ed Fin  Chr Pict  The laws forged by Boyce in auk∣ward imitation of those of the Twelve Tables and imputed to Kenneth III are too gross an im∣position to deceive even the most ignorant There is no authority whatever to be found in our old and genuine fragments of history for Kenneth's having made any laws at all Donal died in his palace of Belachoir  Where The Annals of Ulster at bear "Tuahal Mac Artgusa Archbishop of Fortren Pikland and Abbot of Duncallen  dormivit  " Archbishop is an erroneous translation for chief bishop  on the ides or th of April  Ib    From the Register of St Andrew's we learn that our kings from Kenneth III down to Edgar were buried in Hyona or Icolmkill After that period Dunfermlin was the place of royal sepulture  CONSTANTIN II son of Kenneth III A C reigned years  Chr Pict  years  Chr N  o  II  Innes  but seems the real number for was the ninth year of Grig as after shewn In his third year Olave leader of the Danes and Norwegians in Ireland ravaged Pikland from the day of the new year till that of St Pa∣trick or th March and carried off plunder and hostages  Chr Pict  The Annals of Ulster as usual antedate this event in Some years after Olave returning was slain in battle with Constantin  Ib  The Irish Annals are silent as to the time and manner of Olave's death but mention him in as returning to Ireland from a second invasion of Pikland with ships and great booty Soon after in another invasion the Piks were defeated at  Coachcochlum  with great slaughter and the Northern invaders re∣mained a whole year in Pikland  Chr Pict Ann Ult  But Eystein son of Olave was killed  Ann Ult  In say or Artga king of the Britons of Stratclyde was killed by advice of Constantin III king of the Piks  Ib  Con∣stantin died being by the Annals of Ul∣ster the year after his last defeat by the Danes Fordun says Constantin was slain by the Danes in a cave near Fifeness but the Annals of Ulster and our best chronicle of the time  Chr Pict  are silent as to this  This reign was the most ruinous that North Britain ever beheld or was to behold The Piks had long enjoyed peace or at least freedom from foreign invasions and a default in martial skill and prowess was the natural consequence They were therefore unprepared for their Northern in∣vaders men inured to arms and perpetual war After this reign the Piks changed the scene and generally repelled the invaders with great slaugh∣ter But during the reign of Constantin II or from till the losses Pikland sustained were not confined to booty and captives but were great and permanent For it is clear from the most ancient and authentic monuments of Scandi∣navian history that during this period the Nor∣wegians seized the Orkneys and Hebudes with present Sutherland Caithness and most of Ross∣shires amounting in the whole to more than a fourth part of the Pikish kingdom But of this in the next chapter  See also Supplement sect II The transactions of the Norwegians may be found in the Orcades of Torfaeus Let the reader beware of consulting the abstract by Pope at the end of Cordiner's Antiquities It is even worse than the usual exertions of my countrymen in the Antiquarian liue and is totally inaccurate    ED brother of Constantin II A C reigned year by all accounts and was slain by his own subjects  Chr Pict Ann Ult  c  EOCHOD or Achy and GRIG reigned jointly from till or years The  former was son of Ku king of the Stratclyde Britons who was son of Kenneth III  Chr Pict  The same venerable monument adds that Achy was the real king tho some put Grig who only governed in his name and i suppose Achy was a minor But it seems best to reconcile all ac∣counts by making this a joint reign Who Grig was is obscure The Register of St Andrew's says it was he who slew Ed and he seems to have pretended to govern in the name of Achy to support his usurpation Our old lists and other writers say that Grig or Gregory as they christen him was son of Dungal brother of Al∣pin But that seems dubious The Annals of Ulster are quite silent concerning Achy and Grig The only thing known concerning this reign is that in its ninth year or there was an eclipse of the sun on the day of St Cyriacus or th August which really did happen that year and day  'Ac in nono anno ipso die Cirici eclipsis solis facta∣est" The day of Cyriacus Largus and Smaragdus martyrs is Aug That of Cyricus is June and there was a great eclipse of the sun June just six years before  L'Art de Verifier les dates  So that the chief argument for Ken∣neth's death in not arises from the years assigned to the Pikish kings in the  Chron Pict  and that after reigning eleven years Achy and Grig were expelled the kingdom  Ch Pict  Innes foolishly trembles at this account of Gregory the Great whom the Register of St Andrew's marks as the conqueror of England and Ireland in which silly stuff it is followed by our fablers Strange that no English nor Irish historian should even know the name of this tre∣mendous whale Seriously the condition of Eng∣land and Ireland at this time from till is too perfectly known for such tales The reign of Alfred is too bright to be obscured by a cloud of childish fable The Danes and Norwegians held too sure footing in Ireland for Grig to in∣terfere  And Tighernac who wrote in did not even know of Grig's existence  DONAL II son of Constantin II A C reigned years and died in his eleventh  Chr Eleg  whence by other accounts he reigned eleven years but the chronology requires only ten During this reign the Norwegians again wasted Pikland A battle was fought between them and the Piks in which victory fell to the later Ivar the Norwegian chief fell  Chr Pict Ann Ult  Donal is however said to have fallen by the hands of the Norwegians near Forres  Chr Pict  CONSTANTIN III son of Ed A C reigned years by all accounts This reign is remarkable for length and for action In his third year the Norwegians ravaged Dun∣keld and all Pikland  Chr Pict  The follow∣ing year they were slaughtered at Fraith∣hemi In his sixth year  So the genuine Chronicle App to vol I Innes has blundered the passage  Constantin the king and Kellach the bishop  leges disciplinasque fidei atque jura ecclesiarum evangeliorumque pariter cum Scottis in colle credulitatis prope regalem civita∣tem Scoan devoverunt custodiri Ab hoc die collis hoc nomen meruit i e Collis credulitatis  Chr Pict This passage is clear save the words  pariter cum Scottis  Innes p translates them 'with the Scots' but the arrangement seems to demand 'like the Scots' and the word  pariter  implies this only Certain it is however that in this Chronicle  Scotti  is used for the people of Scot∣land  Hybernenses  for the Irish But the passage may have been transcribed from an older Chronicle in which  Scotti  here implied the Irish Yet if Con∣stantin and Kellach alone took this vow the public name of the hill seems too consequential for the occasion I therefore incline to the opinion of Innes that this was a national assembly and that  pariter cum Scottis  is a barbarous phrase to express that the king and Kellach took this vow at same time and on the same footing with the na∣tional assembly This Hill of Credulity was surely the Moothill near Scoon In this reign died Donald king of the Britons of Stratclyde and Donald son of Ed was elected king  Chr Pict  It is clear from this and the circumstance of Ku king of these Britons being son of Ken∣neth III as abovementioned that the people of Stratclyde at this period secured protection from the Piks by chusing their kings from the Pikish royal family Nor is there a hint of any dissention till the reign of Culen who was slain by these Britons  Chr Pict  The reign of Con∣stantin III was famous for two remarkable bat∣tles The first happened in his eighteenth year  Chr Pict  or the Annals of Ulster al∣ways three or four years antedated place it in It was at  Tinmore  between Constantin and Reginald and the former had the victory  Simeon of Durham  H  st S Cuthberti  col Ser X mentions another battle of Constantin against Regnald at Core∣bridge in favour of Eldred son of Eadulf  earl  of Northum∣bria who had been driven out by Regnald a Norwegian who came with a fleet and seized Northumbria But that work often errs against chronology and seems a late forgery  Chr Pict  The Annals of Ulster give a long account of this memorable engagement The Norwegians and Danes of Ireland desiring as would seem fully to possess North Britain as they did Ireland formed a vast army and landed in North Britain Constantin foreseeing the danger had wisely formed an alliance with the Northern Saxons as the Annals of Ulster call them that is the people of Northumbria still separated from the English under their Danish kings who naturally sought assistance from North Britain to support them against the kings of England and were thus bound by reciprocal tyes The enemy formed in four divisions the first commanded by God∣fred  the two next by different earls and chiefs the fourth and last by Reginald Constantin de∣feated the three first with great slaughter but Reginald attacking him in the rear the battle became dubious when night put an end to the engagement The Danes returned to Ireland without effecting any thing so that the  Chr Pict  says not improperly that Constantin had the vic∣tory This engagement was so great that it is the only one particularly described in the Annals of Ulster which generally only say there was a battle in such a place between such a man and such another  But the second conflict of Constantin was yet greater and the Saxon Annalist has even risen to poetry on the occasion This was the famous battle of  Bruneburg  fought in the thirtyfourth year of Constantin  Chr Pict  that is a computation exactly agreeing with the Saxon Chronicle and Simeon of Durham Athelstan king of England having expelled Anlaff and Godfred princes of Northumberland in  Ann Sax  the former fled to Ireland the later took refuge with Constantin Constan∣tin solicited by Athelstan to give up Godfred but detesting the treachery advised him to leave his kingdom which he did and subsisted by piracy for some years till he died Athelstan re∣senting Constantin's conduct in  Ann Sax Sim Dun  c attacked his dominions by sea and land  Simeon vel Turgot de Dun Eccl inter Scr X et idem de Gest Ang  Gul Malmsb c c  His army ravaged even to Dunfoeder and Wertermore  Places unknown perhaps Wertermor sh be Wes∣termor the Western Sea or Frith of Clyde  his fleet to Caithness Con∣stantin not expecting this sudden invasion was unprepared for resistance but as to any submis∣sion or homage paid by him on this occasion the Saxon Annals and Simeon that is the oldest English writers are mute tho Hoveden and  William of Malmsbury assert the matter  gr  tis  But of these mock homages in next chapter The English army and fleet after this revenge retired Constantin resolving to wipe off this insult formed a powerful confederacy against Athelstan consisting of Anlaf king of Ireland Constantin's soninlaw the Norwegian prince of the He∣budes and Eugenius or Owen king of Cum∣berland still a Cumraig monarchy with Anlaf prince of Northumberland and many petty Norwegian and Danish kinglets of Ireland The West of England was all in the hands of the Bri∣tons but the allies by landing at Bruneburg now it is believed Brugh on the Humber  Simeon de Gest says this battle was fought at  Wendune  Anlof landed in the Humber  Flo Vig  apparently on the south side  evi∣dently intended to reestablish the kingdom of Northumbria first and from thence to invade Athelstan's territories But that great prince with uncommon prudence and success crushed the design at once Tho the allies brought no less than six hundred and fifteen ships  Sim  he was able to attack them on their landing and after as Milton justly observes the greatest and bloodiest battle that this iland ever beheld the allies were totally defeated Five kinglets and many celebrated chiefs fell on the side of the allies Constantin's son was also among the slain He and Anlaf fled to their ships and escaped The loss on Athelstan's side must also have been vast tho carefully concealed by old English his∣torians Certain it is that he was too much weakened to disturb his neighbours again and died in after passing his last years in peace  Constantin survived this battle many years In his extreme old age he retired to a monastery and resigned the kingdom to Malcom  C  r Pict  This happened in and he died about  Ib  The venerable chronicle last quoted men∣tions that one year after the battle of Bruneburg or in  mortuus est Dubican fil Indrechtaig  MORMAIR  Oengusa  'Dubican son of Indrechtaig  Mormair  of Angus died' This singular title also occurs in the Annals of Ulster "A D Maolbryd  Murmor  of Mureve Murray burnt with men about him" and describing the battle of between the Norwegians and Constantin  Murmors  are named as chiefs on Constantin's side And Donel a great  Murmor  of Scotland is killed with king Brian Borowe This title seems equivalent to  thane  or  iarl  but i know not if it is any where else to be found  MALCOM I son of Donal II A C reigned years as our old lists agree save Chr Pict which bears eleven but the chrono∣logy fixes nine Proceeding with an army to Moray he slew Kelac i suppose a rebellious Murmor In his seventh year he wasted England to the river Teise and seized great prey of captives and cattle  The Ulster Annals at mark "A battle upon Scots Albanich Welch and Saxons by Gentiles" i e Danes or Norwegians  Chr Pict  The author relates that some said Constantin led the army himself others that he only instigated Malcom This invasion seems irreconcileable with what we learn from the Saxon Annals namely that in Edmund king of England conquering Cum∣berland from the Britons gave it to Malcom on condition of homage for it and defending the North of England against the Danes But the fact is that after this we find no wars between our kings and those of England till the time of Ethelred A D So that it seems clear that Edmund conciliated the alliance of Malcom and that the Danes tho allied with Constantin were ever after regarded as a common enemy by our kings and those of England The above  invasion as the author of the  Chr Pict  con∣cludes was not done by Malcom but by Con∣stantin's influence Yet i take it to have been made upon the Danes in Northumberland after Malcom had taken possession of Cumberland and not upon  'Angli'  as the above chronicle bears Malcom was slain by the people of Mo∣ray perhaps in revenge of Kelac's death  Chr Pict  INDULF son of Constantin III A C reigned years  'In hujus tempore oppidum Eden vacuatum est ac relictum est Scottis usque in hodiernum diem' Chr Pict  'In his time the town of Eden was vacated and left to the Scots to this day' This noted passage has been quoted by Camden If Edinburgh be meant it is likely that Athelstan in his invasion had seized and garrisoned it But of this in next chapter The above chronicle informs us that some Sumer∣lid Pirates were slain in Buchan This name of Sumerlids is frequent in the thirteenth century and is given to the Norwegians of Argyle and the Hebudes  Sumerliod  means  summerpeople  and perhaps arose from these pirates always appearing in summer This name shews that the Irish lan∣guage was never that of Scotland being a Pikish or Gothic and yet common appellation  ODO son of Malcom I A C reigned years By the Celtic part of his subjects he was surnamed DUFF  In Scandinavian  Duf  va  is  Columba Dufwen Languidus  Ihre But there is room to believe  Duff  a Celtic epithet  or The Black which tho a mere epithet has past for his name The Duan styles him  Dubb Oda  or Odo the Black His reign was constantly disturbed by Culen son of Indulf whose name the author of the  Chr Pict  taking to be Irish has translated  Caniculus Cuil  n  Gaelic  A Whelp  Odo vanquished Culen in a war on Drumcrup perhaps Duncrub in  Perthshire now the seat of Lord Rollo In that battle fell Duchad Abbot of Dunkeld and Dubdou  satrapas  or Murmor of Athol  Chr Pict  The Annals of Ulster seem to refer to this engagement as happening the year before Odo's death 'A battle between Scotsmen about Etir were many slain about Donoch abbot of Duncalten' Next year or Odo was slain by his people  Ann Ult  These

took prisoner the king's son  Innes has again misprinted the  Chron Pict  See App to vol I Both sentences seem to relate to one expedition into England Stanmore and Dereham mark its extent But it was apparently against the Danes of Northumbria and not against the English  lb  Edgar was then king of England and his sons Edward the Martyr and Ethelred followed him in the succession But i am convinced that Northumberland was the part ravaged and some prince of it taken prisoner Matthew of West∣minster a late English writer says that Edgar gave Lothian to Kenneth of which see next chapter Kenneth seems at last to have totally vanquished the Britons of Stratclyde for after his time as before shewn we find no mention of their kingdom The  Chr Pict  closes with tell∣ing us that Kenneth gave Brechen to the church 'Hic est qui tribuit magnam civitatem Brechne do∣mino' This close palpably marks that chronicle not to have been written in Kenneth's time but it was certainly written in the eleventh century The Ulster Annals at mention Kenneth's death  per dolum  or by treachery  So much for the Twelve kings commemorated in the Pikish Chronicle The remaining Six are in greater obscurity but happily a few rays gleam from the English and Icelandic wri∣ters  CONSTANTIN IV son of Culen A C reigned only year and some months He was slain at  Rathveramoen  by Kenneth a son of

of Duff But from a more ancient chronicle written in the reign of William Innes No IV and from the Annals of Ulster it is clear that  Grim  was only an epithet of Kenneth and not his son Grim is a common Danish name  son of Odo or Duff A C reigned years In the year Ethelred king of England wasted Cumber∣land  Sim Dun  Grim was slain by Malcom son of Kenneth IV in  Moeghanard Reg S And  The

'Carrum ab Anglis Werk dicitur'  R Hagust  The Annals of Ulster at mention a great battle between the English and Scots wherein the later were defeated  between him and Uch∣tred the Earl of Northumberland a title suc∣ceeding to the regal and with regal power Eu∣genius Calvus or Owen the Bald kinglet of Lo∣thian assisted Malcom Hoveden and other Eng∣lish historians by their silence concerning its event seem to imply it to have been an indeci∣sive engagement If we credit Icelandic Sagas which are often romantic Sigurd the Gross Earl of Orkney married the daughter of Malcom II and had five sons by her of whom four Sumar∣lid Einar Brusi and Thorfin were Earls of Orkney  Orkneyinga Saga Torf Orc  This Sigurd was slain in the famous battle of Clontarf▪  near Dublin April fighting against Brian Borowe king of Dublin An event which gave rise to the celebrated Icelandic poem so finely translated by Mr Gray in his Fatal Sisters Upon Sigurd's death Malcom gave his grand∣son Thorfin investiture of the earldom of Caith∣ness and Sutherland  Torf p  and appointed counsellors to assist him in the government  Ork Saga p  Thorfin was indeed but five years old at the time  Ib p  He refused the ac∣customed homage to the kings of Norway and died in  Ib  The wars of Malcom II with the Danes are mentioned by our writers but i know not if there be any ground for them at all The history of Denmark and Norway is at this period very clear but it is silent as to any descents on Scot∣land Indeed the fables of Boyce and Buchanan are selfconfuted for they represent Swein the Danish king of England as carrying on these wars and yet the seat is always in Buchan and Moray Fordun tho he mentions one battle against the Norwegians is quite silent as to those wars and so is Winton Major in knew nothing of them That infamous forger Boyce first started this game and struck with the obelisques he saw in the north of Scotland gives them and victories to Malcom II Sigurd and Thorfin who possessed the north of Scotland were in strict amity with Malcom Swein and Canute the Danish kings were wholly occupied with England and far from wishing to excite a new enemy Saint Olave king of Norway carried on no such wars Einar earl of a part of the Ork∣neys ravaged piratically the coasts of Scotland Ireland and Wales about as did Kalf son of Arna about  See Snorr  the Orneyinga Saga or Mr Johnson's Anti∣quitates CeltoScandicae  atn  to  but the concatenation of  names shews that they keeped on the west and indeed would not think of landing in Mo∣ray and putting themselves between Malcom and his ally the earl of Caithness Besides they were pirates beneath serious war In an old Islandic poem Canute is said to have received homage from two kings of Fife  Johnson ibid  but the fiction confutes itself In short there is not a shadow of authority for those Danish wars of Malcom II  The pretended laws of Malcom II form ano∣ther gross fable and able writers have fully shewn them a forgery The story of the division of all the lands in Scotland at the Moothill is no∣toriously false If the feudal system was used before in Scotland as is most probable the idea is absurd If not no power but that of conquest could force the people to such a concession The king was only lord of his own estate of that part alloted for his maintenance the other sub∣jects held their property as absolutely as he did But it is now vain to confute so idle a story The foundation of the see of Murtlach afterward re∣moved to Aberdeen is ascribed to Malcom II but Ruddiman who argues this because Malcom conquered the Norwegians at Murtlach accord∣ing to our fables only builds on the mire of falsehood  Fordun IV says Malcom II founded a bishopric 'apud Murthillach non procul a loco quo superatis Nor∣vagensibus victoriam obtinuit' But a writer of the th century is no authority for this Hector Boyce in his Lives of the Bishops of Aberdeen gives us three bishops of Murtlac from to See Ruddiman's Introduction to the Di∣plomata Scotiae    The Saxon Annals at the year inform us that Canute king of England and Denmark went to Scotland and Malcom became subject to him with two other kings Malbeth and Jehmare Of this in the next chapter The Ulster Annals  at say mention that the son of Mac∣boete Mac Cinaoh was killed by Malcom Mac Cinaoh The last is surely Malcom II whose death is marked at  In the same Annals at we find "Finlegh Mac Roa∣ric king of Scotland  a fuis occisus  " and at "Aulaiv Mac Aulaiv king of Scotland killed by Cinaoh Mac Donal" Scotland in these passages is surly  Scotia  'Ireland'    Malcom II died a natural death at Glammis  mortitus in Glamis  says the  Reg St And  The  Chronicon Elegiacum  thus  In vico Glammis rapuit mors libera regem  Sub pede prostratis hostibus ipse perit  The  mors libera  cannot imply a violent death the last line refers to his former victories as the Chron Eleg says he was  miles victoriosus  The fa∣bles of Fordun and his followers concerning Malcom's dying in a conspiracy have not a sha∣dow of foundation The  Reg St And  carefully marks  interfectus  if a king was slain and no fewer than six kings before Malcom II and three after him are thus marked so that it is cruel to murder Malcom in his old age  DUNCAN A C reigned years This king was the son of Bethoc  Ex dono Radulfi fil Dunegani et uxoris ejus  Bethoc  oc∣curs in a charter to the Canons of Jedburgh by king William engraven at Edin which is only quoted to shew that this name was not peculiar to Malcom's daughter  a daughter of Malcom II by Crinan abbot of Dunkeld  Don∣chath Mac Crini abbatis de Dunkeld  Reg St And Fordun not knowing the dignity of an abbot in these times and that the abbot of Hyona was really archbishop of the north of Ireland and of Pikland as Beda shews and perhaps affronted to find our kings sprung of an abbot creates a new dignity for Crinan He calls him  Crynyn ab∣thanus de Dul ac insularum senescallus  "Crynyn Abthane of Dul and steward of the iles" No iles were then subject to Scotland To support this  nonsense he brings more nonsense and tells us  Abba  is father and  thana  is  respondens  vel  numerans  and that the Abthane was a chamberlain who managed the king's rents and treasury Even Bu∣chanan is missed by this puerile stuff  for the ho∣nour of Scotland  I know of no proof that the title of thane was ever known in Scotland till Mal∣com III introduced Saxon names The word means a servant a soldier an officer but is only sound in England as a title of honour In Den∣mark the  herses  were equivalent to English thanes In Scotland Murmor was the term as above men∣tioned But who ever heard of an Abthane And who knows not that Dul a village could not give a title which was in that age territorial an earl or abthane if you will being always go∣vernor of the province whose title he bore It is needless to dwell on this silly tale Both the  Re∣gistrum St And  and the  Chronicon ElegiacUm  as preserved in the original of the Chronicle of Mel∣rose in the Cotton Library inform us that Crinan was ABBAS an abbot The church now getting rich its great benefices were sought after by men of the highest rank and sons and brothers of kings were bishops and abbots Some abbacies were superior to bishoprics in wealth and mitred abbots equal to bishops in dignity The marriage of churchmen was esteemed as proper as that of others in many kingdoms not yet infected with Roman superstition and intrigue It is unlikely that Malcom should give his daughter in marriage unworthily Crinan  The Annals of Ulster at call Duncan  Mac Crinan  or son of Crinan At is 'A battle between the Scots themselves where fell  Cronan  Abbot of Duncaillen' It seems Crinan outlived his son and died in attempting to re∣venge him The Cronan of is surely the Crinan of  was perhaps his minister of state as usual for churchmen in that period for they possessed all the learning of the times  But it is very likely that the marriage took place before Malcom came to the throne The French history after Charlemagne has many such in∣stances Alfred the Great was the son of Ethel∣wulf who was a priest before he was crowned and Alfred himself was bred up to the church a circumstance to which we owe that learning which perfected his transcendant character The secular power and spirit of the clergy in the mid∣dle ages are well known Even till the council of Rheims monks might marry and it cost many a struggle before the later popish sys∣tem took effect The abbots were esteemed ante∣rior in dignity to nobles for the charters run  Episcopis Abbatibus Comitibus  c From St Bernard's life of Malachy  cap  it appears that the Archbishops of Armagh had succeeded heredi∣tarily for fifteen generations In Charlemagne's time fourteen monasteries of his empire furnished their proportion of soldiers and the abbots were the usual leaders The chief of the republic of Genoa till was an abbot  Abbas Populi  In we find the bishop of Augsburg and the abbot of Fulda killed in the same battle An abbot of Fontenelle assembled troops and opposed Charles Martel Charlemagne in a letter to Frastada one of his

Fulda St Gal Kempten Corbie in Germany were all great princes In modern times the Cardinals Guise Retz Richelieu de la Valette Sourdis were all military men Peter the Great of Russia was grandson of the patriarch Feder Romanow who caused his son Michael to be made Czar In we find a bull granted by the Pope to the abbot of St Denis allowing him to have a particular bishop in his monastery In John XIII allowed  Diederic abbot of St Vincent at Metz to wear pontifical ornaments In the tenth century the emperor Otho made even dukes and counts vas∣sals to the bishops and abbots of Germany In Beda's time the monasteries were often private property belonging to a family and the same men were abbots and captains  Epist ad Egbert  edit Ware The abbots appeared in the national council of England Sax Chr Ingulf M Paris At the time of the Reformation the mitred abbots in the English parliament were more numerous than the bishops In Spain it is well known what power bishop Oppa the son of king Witiza had at the time of the Moorish invasion But not to enlarge the reader who wishes to see the power of the digni∣fied clergy in the dark ages is referred to the his∣torians of the times and to the antiquaries of all countries in Christendom  As the monks were all laymen till a late pe∣riod in Britain and Ireland till the eleventh cen∣tury it is no wonder that the abbots were lay∣men Du

bishop of Metz it is not surprizing that a race of Scotish kings is the progeny of an abbot of Dunkeld There might  be  Abthanes  as well as  AbbaComites  but we must abide by the old testimonies and infer Crinan to have been Abbot of Dunkeld Had Fordun like many others had a little more learning he needed not recourse to lyes  for the honour of Scot∣land  Certain it is that Crinan abbot of Dun∣keld was the ancestor of our kings down to the accession of Baliol and our royal houses are of ABPIN of CRINAN of BALIOL of BRUCE of STUART Duncan's claim was indeed quite new By the form of

family then in Scotland only second to the royal Our late writers say that Macbeth's mother was Doaca a daughter of Malcom II and that his father was thane of Angus but this is mere fable without foundation From certain authority the Chartu∣lary of Dunfermlin we know that Macbeth's own wife was  Gruoch filia Bodhe  'Gruoch the daughter of Bodhe' called by Winton  Gruok  A Scandinavian name

of Duncan and calls Duncan his  eme  or uncle  Macbeth seems to have been an able and bene∣ficent prince The  Chron Eleg  represents fertile seasons as attendants of his reign which Winton confirms If a king makes fertile seasons it must be by promoting agriculture and diffusing among his people the blessings of peace Had he paid more attention to his own interests and less to those of his subjects the crown might have remained in his family But neglecting the prac∣tice of war he fell a martyr to his own virtues The claim of Duncan to the crown was so new that Macbeth can hardly be called an usurper  Simeon of Durham and Roger Hoveden tell us at the year  Rex Scotiae Machetad Romae argentum spargendo distribuit  Sir David Dalrym∣ple in his Annals ridicules those who thence in∣fer that Macbeth went to Rome himself and says the passage only implies that he remitted money to Rome But the plain sense of the words refuses that interpretation and that Macbeth went to Rome were surely no

shew Examples from Irish history may also be adduced but these may suffice to shew the custom very com∣mon and such being the case there is no rea∣son to wrest the plain sense of the words concern∣ing Macbeth His reign was perfectly tranquil and his subjects enjoying prosperity and peace there was no reason against his going to Rome a pilgrimage now frequent in spite of the crimes of Theodora and Marozia who in the preceding century had commanded Rome and degraded its Popes their lovers and bastards in the eyes of nations Winton confirms this acceptation when speaking of Macbeth VI he says  All his tyme was gret plenté  Habundande bathe on lande and se  He was in justice richt lauchful  And til his legis al awfulle  Quhen Bape was Leo the Nynt in Rome  As pilgryme to the court he come  And in his alms he sew silver  Til al pur folk that had myster  In al tyme oysit he to wyrk  Profetabilly for haly kyrk  Leo the ninth ascended the papal chair in Winton surely had not seen Simeon or Roger but relates the circumstance of Macbeth's pilgrimage as he does his amiable character from some do∣mestic monument preserved in spite of the zeal of our writers for Malcom III and his descendants But to gratify these many childish fables were given concerning Macbeth representing him as the son of a devil connected with witches c which Winton likewise details so that the above praise is most impartial and bears the signature of truth as the calumnies on Macbeth are so wild as to shew that gross falsehood alone could ca∣lumniate him Large quantities of the coin of Canute have been found in Scotland but scarce any of elder kings and it is probable that Ca∣nute's coin found this new path in Macbeth's time The recourse of Malcom III to a foreign force in order to assert his right to the crown shews that Macbeth's subjects were well satisfied as his long reign proves of itself  Roger Hoveden at the year says that Osbern surnamed  Pentecost  and Hugh his com∣panion surrendered their castles and by permis∣sion of earl Leofric passing through his earldom to Scotland were received by Macbeth king of Scot∣land Leofric was earl of Mercia and this affair happened during the commotions between Edward king of England and the famous earl Godwin Osbern and Hugh were leaders of the Normans who had come to assist Edward against Godwin  and who with their leaders retired into Scot∣land when Edward was forced to disband them  The Annals of Ulster at have "A battle between the Scots themselves where fell Cronan Abbot of Duncasl∣len" This was surety Clinan who thus survived his son the king    From the Saxon Annals Simeon of Durham Roger Hoveden William of Malmsbury and in short all the English historians of the period it is certain that in the year Siward earl of Northumbria went with Malcom heir of Scot∣land against Macbeth and the battle ensued in which Macbeth was slain They therefore who place this event in err against the clearest chronology of one of the most known events in ancient English history By the consent of all the same English writers and many unpublished chro∣nicles in the Cotton and Harleian libraries Siward earl of Northumbria died in So that the matter admits of no doubt The chronicle of Mal∣rose perfectly agrees with the English accounts and rightly dares the accession of Malcom III in Osbern eldest son of Siward fell in the battle and Brompton relates that Siward was forced instantly to return to Northumbria to sup∣press a rebellion where he died of a disease next year This Siward possessed all the power of an ancient king of Northumbria  See a long and curious account of this gigantic earl in Brompton sub A or in Langebek Scr Rer Dan  In the battle between Siward and Macbeth Scots and Saxeus were slain  Ann Ult  ad  and was of such valour and fame that ancient writers almost wan∣der into poetry when speaking of him He Leo∣fric earl of Mercia and Godwin earl of Kent were powerful as kings and had they not ba∣lanced each other the throne of Edward so much shaken by Godwin must have fallen Much fa∣ble has attended the death of Macbeth but all we know with certainty is that it happened at Lunfanan Aberdeen shire  Reg St And  The  old English writers in their usual style of usurpation toward Scotland say that Siward by Edward's command slew Macbeth and placed Malcom on the throne But this was not so easily done Siward was dead before Malcom ascended the throne and there is room to doubt if Edward at all interfered Malcom being kinsman of Siward as shall pre∣sently be explained  LULAC A C reigned four months and a few days as our old lists published by Innes bear All we know concerning his descent is from one of these lists which says that he was  nepos filii Boide  'grandson of the son of Boide' Macbeth's queen was daughter of Bodhe For∣dun calls him  consobrinus  or cousingerman of Macbeth a mother's sister's son or father's sis∣ter's son But from the list he must have been the grandson of Macbeth's queen's brother  In the Annals of Ulster he is called Lulach Mac Gillcom∣gain  That brother must have been twenty or thirty years older than Gruoch his sister Lulac is sur∣named  Fatuus  or the fool in one of those lists and his relation to Macbeth was almost none Yet he keeped the throne four months against Malcom now left by Siward to manage his own business Siward's army certainly followed him back to Northumberland to suppress the re∣bellion there and to the imbecillity and weak claim of Lulac was Malcom totally indebted for the throne The chiefs and people of Scotland must of free consent have preferred his title to that of Lulac which was far worse and reduced to nothing by the incapacity of its holder The time employed shews that deliberation was used before Malcom's right was fully acknowleged and he was not appointed king till the year after a deliberative interstice of an year or an year and a half In and Edward  of England was too much occupied with the war against Griffin and Algar to attend to foreign matters and there is no room to suspect that he interfered in Malcom's succession so that the old English writers are as unlucky as usual in their usurpations upon Scotland To the consent and approbation of the Scotish chiefs and people Malcom was solely indebted for his dignity due indeed to his heriditary right Lulac was slain at Esseg in S  rathbogy by Malcom's adherents  Reg St And Chron Eleg  Both Macbeth and he were buried at Hyona as well as the legal race  Ib  MALCOM III After this our history is clear but some matters concerning this reign require notice Sir David Dalrym∣ple following Fordun says Malcom began his reign on the day of St Mark or April But Fordun says he was crowned on that day tho from Icelandic writers it appears that no king of Scotland was crowned even in the thir∣teenth century  Torf Norv IV c  and he might be anointed and proclaimed king the year before even by For∣dun's account But the fact is that Fordun by an erroneous chronology as above shewn in many places begins the reign of Macbeth in and extends his seventeen years to whereas not to repeat other errors we know to a certainty that Macbeth was slain in This part of the chronicle of Melrose written in the twelfth century which i have consulted in the original in the Cotton Library dates the accession of Malcom M LVI as plain as possible And no man will prefer the testimony of Fordun a most weak and fabulous writer who wrote two whole centuries after and whose work was interpolated and not published till to the cotemporary veracity of the chronicle of Melrose But another argument annuls all doubt For Malcom III was  certainly slain near Alwick June Now by ALL our old lists he reigned years and some months So that his reign must of course have begun in As to Fordun's date it is but one of the many forgeries of that weak writer and to set his authority against six or seven more ancient would be the heighth of absurdity  Another point is that Malcom III is commonly reputed son of Duncan king of Scotland but there is room to suspect that he was his grand∣son Florence of Worcester  Malcolmum regis Cumbrorum filiumregem constituit Siwardus  sub A    and Roger Hoveden who wrote in the twelfth century say Malcom III was son of the king of Cumbria Duncan was slain in Malcom is then represented as a man who sled to England for protection Put his age when he died he was A great age to go to battle at and yet his great age has to∣tally escaped our writers Nay David I youngest son of Malcom III ascended the throne in and died David I could not be more than when he died and if so much was born in and Malcom III was aged when he begot him All this is strange and suspicious But if we allow Malcom the grandson of Duncan all is well and the authority of the above wri∣ters reconciled Duncan grandson of Malcom II was put in possession of Cumberland by him be∣fore his death  Wil Malms  Malcom II was up∣ward of eighty when he died as Fordun says His grandson Duncan may have easily been between thirty and forty when he ascended the throne and may have assigned Cumberland as usual to a son of his also named Duncan and arrived at man's estate When Duncan the father was slain this Duncan called king of Cumbria by Flo∣rence and Hoveden was unmolested by Macbeth who had no immediate heir and was content  with his other possessions This Duncan of Cum∣bria from weakness sickliness or because of no equal aid died without being able to assert his claim to Scotland But his son Malcom surely not above years of age when he ascended the throne had his right assisted by Siward his rela∣tion who by degrees had acquired great power Malcom III is represented as a young man on his coming to the crown and on his marriage with Margaret Moreover Duncan father of Malcom was married to a daughter more likely to a sister of Siward as all agree and this could hardly be Gruoch who as Winton says became wife of Macheth after Duncan's death The Duan also implies that Duncan father of Malcom III was not Duncan king of Scotland for it gives them different epithets calling the king  Donnchadh ghlain gaoith  'Doncha the Sweetbreathed' and Malcom  Mee Donnchaidh datha drechvi  'son of Doncha the Agreeable' The two Duncans were easily confounded in genealogies but it is be∣lieved the reader will see grounds to infer that Malcom III was son of Duncan king of Cum∣bria son of Duncan king of Scotland  CHAPTER III  Extent of the united territories during this period from    till    THIS subject falls into two parts I The loss of Caithness the Orkneys and Hebudes II The acquisitions on the south  The first part properly belongs to our conside∣ration of the Norwegians in Scotland Supple∣ment Section II where it is shewn that the loss of all the above mentioned possessions happened about the year  The second part concerning the southern ac∣quisitions is one of the most interesting articles of early Scotish history and must be considered here  In Part III ch it has been shewn that in the Piks recovered LOTHIAN or all the south east part of Scotland from the Forth to the Tweed after it had been held by the Angli of Northum∣bria for about a century No trace can be found in any old English writer that the Angli ever re∣gained Lothian and Beda expresily says that when he wrote or in the Piks maintained the acquisition But the Angli retained the south of Galloway where Candida Casa was still theirs in Beda's time as was Malrose on the east It would seem from Beda that Cuningham on the west of Galloway also belonged to Northumbria in his time and his continuator says that in Edbert king of Northumbria added  Campum Cyil  which appears to be Kyle to his dominions Stratclyde remained a petty kingdom till about  when conquered by the Piks but in it paid homage to Edbert the Northumbrian and Ungust the Pikish king  The later part of the history of Northumbria is obscure but certain it is that domestic broils and the arrival of the Danes at the beginning of the ninth century must have effectually prevented any enlargement of the Northumbrian territory in the Anglic times The Danish period of Northum∣brian history remains to be considered and is un∣happily yet more obscure than the Anglic But there is not a shadow of proof that the Danish kingdom of Northumbria ever reached beyond the Tweed far less that the earldom of Northumbria till th cent exceeded that boundary It on the contrary is evident from all such testimonies as remain that York was the seat of the Danish kings and earls of Northumbria and the parts on the north bank of the Humber their prime domain Asser and others say the Danes settled on the Tine and thence wasted the Piks and Stratclyde Welsh Richard of Hexham who wrote about in Northum∣bria expressly says that Northumbria reached from Humber to Tweed and that Deira extend∣ed from Humber to Teise Bernicia from Teise to Tweed Roger of Chester tells that Kenneth ascending the Pikish throne acquired all the ter∣ritory down to the Tweed  After the failure of the Anglic monarchy of Northumbria not a trace can be found that either Angli or Danes held any possession in the south of present Scotland The Piks of Galloway threw off the Anglic yoke on the failure of that monar∣chy and before we find them mentioned as an independent people After the Angli lost all the country north of Tweed and far from recovering any part they soon after lost all the territory between Tweed and the Cheviot hills and Solway frith Kenneth III as above stated  burned Dunbar and Melrose  usurpata  which had been 'usurped' by the Angli This word shews that Lothian or the southeast of Scotland be∣tween Forth and Tweed was regarded as a pos∣session of the Pikish crown and a settlement or two of the Angli as usurpations In Athel∣stan wasted Scotland even to Dunfeodar and Wer∣termore These names unhappily cannot be ad∣justed  Goodal in the best chapter of his work  Introd ad Fordun  has shewn that Usher Carte Innes and others have fallen into gross ertors by mistaking  Scottiswath  for  Scottiswatre  The former as Fordun unde∣signedly tells us in two places is Solway frith the later is perfectly known to be the frith of Forth Indeed  wath  or  wade  implies a ford  In German  Twat brevia seu vada  Jun Batavia p  while  watre  means a small sea or limb of the sea This error abridged the dominions of Scotland of all the tract between Solway frith and Forth and is of ancient standing for Giraldus in his  Descrip∣tio Albaniae  falls into it and taking  Scottiswath  for  Scottiswatre  makes the Forth the boundary be∣tween England and Scotland in his time which is so notoriously false as to deserve no notice The same  Scottiswath  is also called  Myreford  by old English writers The Solway sands were passable at low water and were the path by which William the Conqueror entered Scotland as did Edward I and others after him The  Abernith  where Wil∣liam met our Malcom was at the mouth of the river Nith as Goodal fully shews and not at Abernethy on the Tay which was called  Aberne∣than  not  Abernith  These watry sands of Solway were termed  Scottiswath  or the Scotish ford after Cumberland had been yielded to Scotland and were also very properly termed  Myreford  or miry ford But such is the power of chance that this  last term has also given rise to a blunder and as  d  and  th  are often interchanged in Gothic dialects  Mireford  sometimes appears  Mireforth  and has been interpreted to apply to the river Forth John of Wallingford mentions the  Castrum Puel∣larum  as at the northern extremity of Northum∣bria This name our writers apply to Edinburgh It is a mere translation of the name of  Dumfries DunFres Dun  castellum urbs  Fru Fre  virgo nobilis  Icelandic  This was the name given by the Piks while the Cumri of Cumbria called the same place  Abernith  as it stands at the mouth of the Nith  It is no wonder that these erratic coincidences puzzled and misled even early English writers who generally lived far from Northumbria and were utter strangers to it Richard of Hexham a Northumbrian therefore deserves more credit than them all put together and he marks the Tweed as the northern boundary of Northumbria  Lothian or the southeast of Scotland therefore never belonged to the English after the year but was always a Pikish possession Old English writers agree as to Cumberland being given up by Edmund to Malcom in but as to  Lothene  they differ widely Some say Edgar gave it to Kenneth about but they are late writers Simeon of Durham an early writer says Eadulf Cudel gave it up to the Scots in terror about But before judging of this the reader must discuss what country is meant by  Lothene  for names vary much and there is proof that this Lothene was not present Lothian nor  London  formerly the name of a tract between Lanerkshire and Airshire  The Saxon Chronicle says 'King Mal∣com departed with his army out of Scotland into Lothene in England and there remained' Flo∣rence of Worcester relating the same calls the place  Provincia Loidis  In the continuation of the  Saxon Chronicle a 'J bishop of Lothene' is mentioned  Probably a  titular  bishop as not unusual in the middle ages The bishops of the Orkneys mentioned by old English histo∣rians as in England were of the same class  John of Wallingford places Lou∣thian with Deira not with Bernicia and says there were disputes concerning it between the English and Scotish even in his time In Malcom IV was forced to surrender to Henry II 'the city of Carlile Newcastle and the county of London' These instances surely cannot apply to present Lothian nor London There is great rea∣son to believe that the present county of North∣umberland was anciently called Lothene or Lo∣den before the great name of Northumbria which anciently included all England north of the Hum∣ber was restricted to that petty county The cir∣cumstances of Lothene's being joined to New∣castle and having a bishop as they are proofs against Lothene's implying Lothian remote from Newcastle and having no bishop till when Charles I founded the see of Edinburgh so they strongly imply that Lothene was no other than present Northumberland Lindisfarne was a bi∣shopric Mr Hume who is by no means disposed to flatter Scotish prejudices shews that there must have been a Lothen in England because  ' The Saxon Chronicle p says that Malcom Ken∣mor met William Rufus in Lodene in England  It is agreed by all historians that Henry II only reconquered from Scotland the northern counties of Northumberland Cumberland and Westmoreland See Newbriggs p Wykes p Hemingford p Yet the same coun∣try is called by other historians  Loidis comitatus Lodonensis  or some such name See M Paris p M West p Annal Waverl p and Diceto p  This last mentioned author when he speaks of Lothian in Scotland calls it  Loheneis  p though he had called the Eng lish territory Loidis'  Hist vol  II  notes  Indeed those old English writers who inform us that Mal∣com gave up the  comitatus Lodonensis  It is probable that this Comitatus refers to power not to territory Malcom gave up the jurisdiction of the Justiciari∣us Laodoniae so far as it extended to the northern counties of England when subject to Scotland "Comitatus Comitis diguitas jurisdictio territorium Apud Anglos locus publi∣cus "in quo Vicecomes uniuscujusque provinciaejurisdic∣tionem suam exercetConventus Juridicus in Comitatu vul∣go AssisiaTerritorium urbis jurisdictio loci alicujus suis tinibus circumscriptaDominium  Seigncurie  Comitatus pro ipsa quae dominii jure pensitatur pr  estatione interdum sumi∣turFacultas commeatus"  Du Cange  in voce  to Henry II afford full proof that Lothian in Scotland is not meant for it is perfectly known that this country was never given up whereas present Northumber∣land actually was There is therefore ground to infer that the whole country from the Tine and Newcastle up to the Forth was anciently called  Lothene  that name being thus as extensive as that of Galloway which once extended from Glyde to Solway But as the name of Galloway gradually diminished and past south so that of Lothian like that of Northumberland gradually diminish∣ed and passed north the former being a Scotish term the later an English and as society ad∣vanced and smaller divisions arose the vague term gradually passed to the extremities Ptolemy and Richard mark the Ottadeni or old inhabitants of Lothian as reaching from Bodotria or the Forth down to the river Tine and wall of Gallio Thus the country as possessed by one people might well receive one name But the Saxon Chronicle by the special and remarkable term 'Lothene  on England  ' Lothian  in England  also implies that there was 'Lothene  on Pihtland  ' Lothian in Pikland Else why this peculiar ad∣junct  in England  for there is no example in that work or any other monument of English history  where the name of a country is put with the ad∣junct that it was in England a ridiculous informa∣tion if not a necessary distinction The present name of Northumberland is quite a late one and that county itself is omitted in Domesday book with Cumberland and Westmoreland  The counties omitted in Domesday are Northumberland Cumberland Westmoreland Durham which seems to have been churchland the  patrimonium Sancti Cuthberti  and Lanca∣shire is put under Yorkshire and Cheshire  all then not belonging to England but to Scotland Old Northumberland was chiefly Yorkshire being the country immediately north of the Humber This was called Deira while present Durham bound∣ed by the Teis on the south formed the chief part of Bernicia as appears from the best authority that of Simeon of Durham The tract from the Tine to the Forth or between the walls was in Roman times a vast march and regarded as one uniform territory so that its having after but one name was a matter of course But after the Piks had seized all down to the Tweed its general name fell into two divisions Pikish and Anglic English Lothian and Pikish Lothian as we say French Netherlands Austrian Netherlands Dutch Netherlands Beda calls Pikish Lothian the  pro∣vincia Pictorum  of which Trumwin was bishop and the name of Pentland hills or Pikland hills also marks it peculiarly a Pikish possession When a matter is universally known in their own times writers never explain it for the sake of posterity and it is well known what obscurity this practice throws on parts even of Greek and Roman history Thus the old English writers thought it needless to explain the difference between the English and Pikish Lothian when all the readers of their own days must have seen at once which was meant The break in English history also occasions obscu∣rity for William of Malmsbury observes that from Beda's time to his that is from the eighth till  the twelfth century no general writer had arisen and this period is unfortunately the most obscure and on which we want most light as the passage from ancient to modern times To proceed in an  Eugenius Calvus rex Lutinensium  is men∣tioned as assisting Malcom II at the battle of Carrum This is the only time that a king of this people is mentioned and it is difficult to conceive the meaning of this singular instance He seems a titular king whom Malcom supported against the earl of Northumberland in his claim for the English Lothen or present Northumberland but his title was lost with the battle of Carrum and we read no more of him Let me only observe further that by all accounts of the old English writers Cumberland was given up to Scotland long before Lothene was and it is impossible to conceive that when Cumberland was given up the Scots were not also possessed of the adjacent territory on the north All accounts imply that Cumberland was then contiguous to the Scotish dominions and Galloway was an independent country till the twelfth century  See Dalrymple's Annals Mat Paris says "Bri∣tannia quae complectitur Scociam Galeweiam et Walliam" Gough's Topog I  It follows that the Scots when they acquired Cumberland were possessed of the southeast part of present Scotland down to Solway frith The Lothian afterward given up must of course have been the  Lothene on England  or present Northumberland  But other circumstances remain to be consider∣ed It was rather unfair in the Scotish writers who assert Lothian as a part of Scotland to con∣ceal the testimony of the  Regiam Majestatem  on this subject as at first glance it seems to favour the English claim For certain it is that this work excludes Laodonia and Galwegia as Sir James Dalrymple  Collections p  observes as not parts of Scot∣land  In ch it mentions as two districts the  Citra Mare Scoticum  and the  Ultra in Laodonia  And even in the reign of David II there was a  Justiciarius ex parte Boreali  and a  Jus∣ticiarius Laodoniae  Ibid from an ancient charter The  Regiam Majestatem  is no doubt an English work but the passages concerning Scotland have been inserted at an early period  Lothian being thus put as distinct from Scotland it may be said that it must of course have been regarded as part of England  It is answered that by the same rule Nor∣thumberland Durham Cumberland Westmor∣land must be regarded as part of Scotland be∣cause omitted in Domesday book Caithness and Sutherland are omitted in the  Regiam Majestatem  because subject to the Norwegians as for the same cause are the Orkneys Hebudes Argyle and Lorn It mentions the chief towns of the following shires for lawproceedings namely Gowrie Stormont Athol Fife Strathern Angus Mar Buchan Ross and Moray then adds  Haec sunt loca capitalia Scotiae Comitatuum per  TOTUM REGNUM The  Descriptio Albaniae  confirms this extent of Scotland  proper  in the twelfth century But tho the Orkneys Caithness Sutherland are omitted because subject to the Norwegian earls of Orkney and the Hebudes Argyle and Lorn because subject to the Norwegian kings or lords of the Iles and Galloway as having its own princes it follows not that Lothian is omitted as subject to England In the next chapter it is shewn that the term  Scotia  was at first yet more confined in North Britain and it did not extend to Lothian till a late period But tho the  Mare Scoticum  or Frith of Forth divided Lothian from Scotland  proper  yet it was ever after the year regarded as subject to the Pikish or Scotish mo∣narchs  So much for a Lothian in England and i hope the reader will do me the justice to believe that had not there been proofs that the Lothian given up to Scotland was not present Lothian i would with the utmost pleasure have fought for truth against the prejudices of my countrymen But upon full examination the prejudice here appears to be on the other side and to rest with these weak writers Carte and others who have hither∣to condescended to treat English history When English talents so long wasted on foreign affairs are applied to English history this point with many others may be stript of prejudice and ap∣pear in the light that ability lends to truth It is a matter of the merest curiosity and of no more im∣portance than Stephen's holding his crown of the Pope so that he must be weak indeed who blends prejudice with it on either side For my own part i have peculiarly guarded myself against prejudice in favour of Scotland tho i am also by no means prejudiced against that country but had i not met with the above obstacles i should surely have inferred that the Scotish Lothian was the only one known to or meant by old English historians  As to the Scotish Lothian it is also known by that name to English writers Roger Hoveden mentions  Dunbar cum adjacentibus terris in Lodo∣nies  'Dunbar with the adjacent lands in Lothian' Its people are the  Lodonenses  who make so great a figura in the famous War of the Standard It is very remarkable that the old historians of this war mention as in the army of David king of Scotland along with Cumbrenses Nordanum∣brenses Galweienses Laodunenses and such large names the  Tevidalenses  or men of Teviotdale This noted tract is very small but lying between the English and Scotish Lothian its people before the English Lothian was given up to the Scots had from constant borderwar acquired great skill in arms which they retained to a late period It  is therefore no wonder that they are thus emi∣nently distinguished and specially named tho they formed a part and a very small one of the Lodonenses  Besides Lothene in England or present Nor∣thumberland  Present Northumberland was surely in the hands of the Scots at the time they took possession of Cumberland When Duncan entered England Durham was the first town besieged  Simeon Dun  the Scotish monarchy also during this period acquired CUMBERLAND This acqui∣sition preceded that of Lothene in time but the train of circumstances required to elucidate the later induced me to consider it first especially as this of Cumberland is clear and positive Innes and Carte have indeed confused this plain fact by mistaking the two kingdoms of Strat∣clyde and Cumbria for one and the same But as this error has been fully detected in the second part of this work it is needless to insist on a matter so clear from all the old English writers as that the Cumberland given up to Scotland was present Cumberland with Westmoreland In the Doomsday Book both these counties are omitted as well as present Northumberland be∣ing not subject to England but to Scotland As for the kingdom of Stratclyde whose capital was Dumbarton it was palpably subdued by the Scots about after which it is never men∣tioned as formerly explained at great length Both Cumberland and Lothene were restored by Malcom IV to Henry II but it is perfectly known that Scotland had after that reddition the very same bounds as now as the old English historians in passages innumerable fully evince This fact is so broad and clear as to render all further arguments on the subject unnecessary  It is proper to add a few words on the pre∣tended homage paid by the kings of Scotland to those of England during this period The situa∣tion  of these two kingdoms in the same iland was such as naturally to suggest to the writers of the larger and more powerful an idea of inferiority and dependance in the smaller which had no neigh∣bour to support it As there was also no other field of glory for England but Scotland the wars with France being all posterior to the Norman Conquest those writers who wished to adorn any saintly king with historic fame generally drew upon the Scotish bank This practice appears so early as the reign of saint Oswald king of Northumber∣land about the year who is termed  Impera∣tor totius Britanniae  even by a Dalriadic writer Cuminius who sensible of the insignificance of the Dalreudini in Britain adds Pikland  gratis  to Oswald's empire This risible title of a king of Northumberland during the heptarchy the other six kingdoms of which not to speak of Pikland certainly never acknowleged any such claim only serves to shew the spirit of these pious authors who seem to have thought that all hu∣man truth was to be sacrificed to sainthood a matter of faith For as reason alone is the judge and guardian of truth and in those ages faith or blind credulity was considered as above human reason it necessarily followed that the more false any miracle or tale was yet if it concerned a saint there was the more merit in believing it  Credo quia impossibile est  The source of these mock honours of Saint Oswald is therefore so pal∣pable that it becomes needless to remark that if the other kings in Britain acknowleged his su∣periority it must have been in his saintly charac∣ter for he fought not one battle against the Piks or any of the heptarchic kings except that against Penda king of Mercia in which Oswald was slain There is however reason to conclude as mentioned Part III ch that Oswi king of Northumbria actually vanquished the Piks  and that they paid tribute to the Northumbrian kings till when Brudi IV conquered and slew Egfrid  Such is the only claim of the kingdom of Northumbria upon Pikland and it deserved mention here before proceeding to the period especially under view from till The kingdom of Northumbria which alone could pretend any such miracle as to Pikland soon after declined before the Pikish power and be∣came at last a prey to the Danes about The Danish kings of Northumbria till and the earls after certainly were not saints and accord∣ingly we find no claim of theirs upon the homage of North Britain Let us therefore pass to those of the kings of England  Old English writers preserve no less than six such  That of Edward the Elder son of Al∣fred the Great in  That Althelstan  That of Edred  That of Edgar  That of Canute  That of Ed∣ward the Confessor  The Saxon Chronicle says that in Ed∣ward the Elder went to  Bedecanwillan  in Pikland where he built a strong town on the borders and the king of Scots honoured him as sovereign to∣gether with the whole Scotish nation Edward was certainly a great and victorious monarch and subjected Northumbria for a time but Constan∣tin III king of Pikland was certainly not a monarch capable of gratuitous concessions as his after conduct to Athelstan evinces As he was himself harrassed by the Danes and had van∣quished Reginald in or just the year before this supposed homage it might be that he met Ed∣ward to form a league against the common enemy The  Chron Pictorum  tho particular concerning this king's reign is quite mute as to this inter∣view and the circumstance that  all the Scots  joined in the homage seems sufficient to stamp it as a mere glorious fable  That Athelstan ravaged Scotland in is certain and it is possible that Constantin paid him some submission but as to homage for his kingdom we have only the evidence on one side and certainly no just man would judge upon hearing only one party Nay the English writers seem to confute themselves for they say that in eleven years after this homage Edmund gave Cumberland to Malcom I on condition of assisting him in his wars whereas had Scotland been under homage to England its king was surely bound to assist England in war without so large a present  Edred ravaged Northumberland but as to the gratuitous submission of the Scots it is hard to believe Even Northumbria was not yet sub∣ject to England but furnished its kings full em∣ployment It is surely then most improbable that with such a screen between them the Scots should be such cowards Their opposite conduct in the clear part of English history shews the im∣possibility of such eternal dastardly submission If we credit English writers no king of England could make war on Northumbria but the Scotish king paid gratuitous homage Who can believe this The jest is carried so far and repeated so often that it becomes stale How comes it that not one king of Scotland was ever cited to ap∣pear in England before his liege lord to whom appeals lay But as to this instance and the three following the cession of Cumberland to Scotland in by English accounts restricts the homage paid to be for Cumberland not for the kingdom The kings of England paid homage to France for their possessions in France but what should be said to a French writer who would pretend that homage to be for England  Edgar founded no less than religious houses and the tales of ecclesiastic writers con∣cerning him are therefore much to be suspected of panegyric The story of his being rowed in a barge on the Dee by eight tributary kings is a palpable monkish legend and may perhaps be still found to be borrowed from a similar circum∣stance in some old romance From the Saxon Chronicle it is clear that six petty kings met Edgar to make an alliance not to pay homage This will lead any man of candour to suspect that when a king of Scotland entered into a league with England the monkish writers strangers to human affairs always dreamed of submission and homage The reign of Edgar was quite peaceable and stripped of monkish pa∣negyric to their patron was that of a slothful and debauched prince sunk in pleasures and in the most contemptible slavery to the clergy The charter of Oswald's law in which Edgar asserts his having conquered all even to Norway with a great part of Ireland is a gross and notorious instance of monkish slattery who in gratitude for their charters thus set that weak prince's seal to the most absurd falsehoods The Irish Scotish Northern writers hardly even mark Edgar's ex∣istance as king of England The  Chronicon Picto∣rum  represents Kenneth as invading England in∣stead of paying homage The Annals of Tigher∣nach and of Ulster barely mark Edgar's death The  Orkneying a Saga  knew nothing of him The power of the Danes had been quite broken before when their kingdom in Northumbria ceased Edred and Edwi predecessors of Edgar were equally free from Danish invasion so that Edgar's ability is not to be weighed by this circumstance He was indeed the very first monarch of all Eng∣land and it is no wonder that his amity was courted by the other kings in Britain  Canute in according to the Saxon Chronicle went to Scotland and Malcom king of Scots and two other kings Maelbaeth and Jehmarc became subject to him But William of Malmsbury says that Malcom only permitted Duncan his grandson and heir who was possessed of Cumberland to pay homage for that province This plain account sufficiently refutes the usurpa∣tive style of the Saxon Chronicle  Some old English writers say that in Siward earl of Northumbria put Malcom on the throne of Scotland by command of Edward king of England This is false because Siward died before Malcom came to the throne  This singular usurpative style concerning Scot∣land is peculiar to the old English writers who seem thus to avenge the conquests of their own country by Sweyn by Canute by William I upon poor Scotland From Beda's time till William of Malmsbury or at least till the end of the eleventh century hardly one English writer arose  A foreign writer Guy of Amiens "en ecrivit la guerre d'Angleterre en vers" Hist de Picardie I  When writers reappeared in Eng∣land they were stung with the degradation of their countrymen under their Danish and Nor∣man conquerors and naturally wished to relieve their minds by swelling the glory of the old English kings Scotland was the only country over which any probable claim could be forged and they have not spared it Camden justly ob∣serves that the Saxon Annals never mention any battles lost by the English Brompton says Hardeknute held Scotland in constant and peace∣able subjection  Iste rex Hardeknoutus per totum tempus quo regnavit regni Scotiae subjectionem pacifice habebat  Ser  X col  The Saxon Chronicle asserts that William I  subdued  Scotland and that Henry I gave leave to Alexander king of Scotland to reign The notorious falsehood of these instances  renders the rest still more suspicious if it does not stamp them utterly false How is all this Scotland was always subdued always to subdue always making homage to England always mak∣ing war on England always subject yet not a trace of it but single sentences of English writers without so much as one permanent fact Surely human affairs proceed not thus but if a kingdom be subject to another fixt and lasting marks al∣ways appear The forged charters of Harding and others concerning Scotish homage have been fully exposed by Rymer and other English antiquaries But does not the need of such for∣geries prove invincibly that the claim itself was all one forgery As for the gifts of Cumberland and Lothene or present Northumberland there is room to suspect them as fabulous as the ho∣mage and to question if any homage was paid for them till the time of Canute They seem ac∣quisitions by conquest and examples of such gifts are not found in the history of any other country But as Henry I gave leave to Alexan∣der to reign such it is likely were those gifts In the history of Denmark the claim of the Emperor of Germany to the homage of that kingdom oc∣curs and one Danish king was taken prisoner and forced to pay it But Germany being sur∣rounded with inferior states its writers had many affairs to attend and do not harp upon this string always while poor Scotland was the only country over which English writers could extend their claim Hence the style of old English wri∣ters concerning Scotland is quite peculiar and full of a bitter usurpation unknown to any other ancient writers whose works have ever fallen in my way Such mock claims are indeed found Wormius  Series Reg Dan p  says Frotho son of Harding king of Denmark subdued Germany and Bri∣tain Torfaeus represents the Anglosaxon kings  as tributary to the Danish kings of Northumberland Regnar Lodbrog subdued Ireland Pikland and the Orkneys and gave them to his friends Si∣guard and Rathbart  Saxo Gram Rami Nori regnum c  Geoffrey of Monmouth says Arthur conquered France Germany Norway c c c Fordun's Gregory the Great con∣quered Ireland and most of England And of the same kind are the English claims over Scot∣land  CHAPTER IV  Origin of the name SCOTLAND  THAT the name  Scotia  or  Scotland  origi∣nally belonged to Ireland and continued to belong to that country alone till a late period begins now to be acknowleged even by the fiercest Scotish writers This fact clearly appears from the following numerous authorities while that the names  Scoti Scotia  were ever applied to the present Scots and Scotland before the reign of Malcom II or beginning of the eleventh cen∣tury not  one  authority can be produced  The first mention of the name  Piks  is by Eumenius the panegyrist who says as fully quoted Part III ch I that before the time of Julius Caesar Britain that is the part of Britain fouth of Forth and Clyde or Roman Britain was only invaded by the Piks and Irish  Pictis modo et Hibernis  This was written in the year and the name of Scots was still unknown For as the Britons before they knew the indigenal ap∣pellation of the Piks termed them Caledonians so before they knew the indigenal name of that superior people in Ireland whose warlike spirit burst upon them they called them  Hiberni  or Irish from the name of the iland So in later times the pirates of Scandinavia were all called Normans before the indigenal names of Danes Norwegians Swedes came to be known But the name of Scots is first mentioned by Ammia∣nus Marcellinus at the year and not as be∣longing to most ancient times as Eumenius men∣tions that of  Picti  but as present and immediate  under that year  In Britanniis cum Scotorum Picto∣rumque gentium ferarum excursus  c Thus on the very first mention of the name  Scotti  it is joined with that of  Picti  just as  Hiberni  had been sixtyfour years before by Eumenius This com¦pared with the subsequent authorities affords a clear inference that from the very first  Hiberni  and  Scoti  were synonymous that Ireland was  Scotia  and the Irish  Scoti  Indeed it is risible to see some of our infatuated writers suppose that such a small country as Scotland could suffice for two grand nations the Piks and Scots while England had but one the Britanni Gaul but Galli Spain only Hispani Do these weak men imagine that the noble iland of Ireland a country superior in size and far more in fertility and popu∣lation to Scotland was quite invisible to the Ro∣mans or that by another miracle the inhabitants of a country so very near to Britain never invaded this iland Do open your eyes gentlemen or at least do not imagine that because ye are blind others must be so At Ammianus mentions  Picti Saxonesque et Scotti et Attacotti  At  Picti Attacotti  and  Scotti  The former passage no more implies the Scots to have been settled in Britain than the Saxons And the Attacotti or as shewn above those Scots who settled in Pik∣land are specially distinguished from the Scotti proper or those of Ireland  Ethicus the Cosmographer or whoever wrote the work in his name belongs to the same pe∣riod and says  Hibernia a Scotorum gentibus coli∣tur  'Ireland is inhabited by the nations of Scots'  Claudian also about has this line  Scotorum cumulos flevit glacialis Ierne  'Icy Ireland weeped the slaughtered heaps of Scots' And again  totam cum Scotus Iernen mo∣vit  'when the Scot moves all Ireland' No rea∣der need be told that  Iorne  is the Greek name of Ireland and all interpreters Barthius Gesner c agree in this  Claudian errs in supposing Ireland a very cold country  glacialis  He only judged from its northern situation  Those among us who have dreamed of Strath  Erne  a valley in Scotland only shew that national prejudice like that over∣weening selflove from which it really springs is a species of madness A schoolboy would be whipped for such an interpretation and fo∣reigners may perhaps suspect that i am in jest with my Scotish valley known to Claudian but alas it is too true  Pudet haec opprobria nobis  Et dici potuisse et non potuisse refelli  In the next century Orosius has  Hibernia insula inter Britanniam et Hispaniama Scoiorum gentibus colitur  'Ireland an iland between Bri∣tain and Spainis inhabited by the Scotish na∣tions' The letters of St Patrick published by Usher also clearly mark the Scoti in Ireland only The Scots to whom Patrick was sent are perfectly known to have been the Irish  In the sixth century Cogitosus author of the life of St Brigid as quoted by Usher  It may be found in Messingham or Colgan The former's edition i have compared  suffici∣ently evinces in different places the Scots to be Irish Gildas marks the Piks as invading the Britons  ab aquilone  'from the north' the Scots  a circio  'from the north west' For they always passed from the north of Ireland to join the Piks but no part of present Scotland is on the northwest of Roman Britain laterly extending to the Clyde  In the seventh age Isidorus is most explicit  Scotia eadem et Hibernia proxima Britonnia insula  'Scotia the same as Ireland an iland very near  Britain' Adomnan in his life of Columba con∣firms the same throout for Columba sails from Scotia to Britain and Hyona and from thence to Scotia c c c  In the next Beda speaking of Hibernia or Ireland says  haec Scotorum patria est  'this is the native country of the Scots' And in passages innumerable his  Scotia  is always Ireland and his  Scoti  the Irish Speaking of the Dalreudini and their king Aidan he calls them  Scotti qui sunt in Britannia  'the Scots in Britain' as a special mark of distinction from the  Scotti  or Irish a term he puts sometimes absolutely The Geographus Ravennas says  Hibernia quae ut dictum est et Sco∣tia appellatur  In the ninth century Eginhart in his life of Charlemagne says  Norwegi Hiberniam Scoto∣rum insulam aggressi a Scotis in fugam conversi sunt  'The Norwegians invading Ireland the iland of the Scots are put to flight by the Scots' It is certain therefore that the Irish alone are the Scots of Eginhart and that the correspondence he mentions between Charlemagne and the  reges Scotorum  kings of the Scots refers solely to Ire∣land That emperor procured learned men from Ireland but did not probably know even the ex∣istence of the Dalreudini or British Scots In the same age Rabanus Maurus bishop of Mentz says in his Martyrology  Natale Kiliani martyris et duorum sociorum ejus qui ab Hibernia Scotorum in∣sula venientes  c Walafrid Strabo in his life of St Gallus also repeatedly shews Ireland to be the Scotia The monk of Saint Gall in his history of Charlemagne also says of the famous Clemens and Albinus founders of the University of Paris  Contigit duos Scotos de Hibernia cum mercatoribus Britannis ad littus Galliae devenire viros et in sae∣cularibus et in sacris scripturis incomparabiliter cruditos  'It happened that two Scots of Ireland came to the French coast with British merchants  those men were incomparably skilled both in sae∣cular and sacred letters King Alfred's  Scotland  is always Ireland  In the tenth century Notkerus Balbulus in his Martyrology speaking of Columba V  Id Jun  has  In Scotia insula Hibernia depositio S Columbae  'In Scotia the iland Ireland the placing of the relics of St Columba c  See many more examples of this century in Usher Ant Brit Eccl p where also and in the Latin epistle of Lynch to Bullay at the end of Ogygia Vindicated nume∣rous other authorities may be found of the other centuries no fact in the history of the middle ages being so amply au∣thenticated as this    In the eleventh century Marianus Scotus at the year has  Sanctus Kilianus Scotus de Hi∣bernia insula  c 'Saint Kilian a Scot of Ireland' Hermannus Contractus in his Chronicle

king of Ire∣land as Ware justly remarks who in that year obtained a victory over the Danes but they soon returned so that the tribute continued for many years in spite of this victory The Annals of Ulster date this victory  Nay in the twelfth century St Bernard in his life of St Malachy calls Ireland  Scotia  and the Irish  Scotti  For he calls Malachy  Hibernus  and after says  ab  ulteriori

Galli  Giraldus Cam∣brensis also speaking of the Irish says  Dicti sunt et Gaideli dicti sunt et Scoti  But that present Scotland was so called before the eleventh century there is not  one  authority whatever  What do those weak and ignorant bigots who have fought on the contrary side produce No∣thing except the most shameful subterfuge and falsehood and the most impudent railing Fight∣ing as their blindness persuades them for the honour of their country they are the bitterest enemies of their country Fable i have found in the writings of other countries but opposition to the most open and clear truths i am sorry to say i never found save in the writings of Scotish anti∣quists Their productions are indeed so poor that they never reach foreign notice but only hu∣mour sickly brains at home else i should tremble for the fame of my country which has produced men capable of open enmity to truth and reason This is not patriotism but the mere madness of selflove tho if even patriotism were ever opposite to truth and reason every man of sense and inte∣grity would dash it on the ground before their altars  Irish writers are certainly prejudiced on the one side but it is the right one and Scotish writers on the other but it is the wrong Foreigners however must be impartial and they uniformly give it against the Scotish Bozius an Italian Molanus Miraeus Canisius Gretserus Germans Sirmond a Frenchman nay Major and Buchanan Scotishmen too learned for such ignorant prejudi∣ces gave it against us even at the beginning of the controversy It is perfectly known that the English writers have been uniformly on the Irish side and in spite of the insinuation of an author  Mr J Macpherson who in his Introduction to the Hist c says the English only wished to favour the weakest side  who judges of others by himself i do believe that these English writers are most impartial and would have fought for us had we been under the banner of truth Of late the learned editors of the ancient French historians are clear against us and in their map for the epoch of Charlemagne mark Ireland as SCOTIA D'Anville the greatest of modern geographers is of the same mind and as he observes 'Les Caledoniens ne sont point a de∣stinguer des Picti' 'the Caledonians are not to be distinguished from the Piks' so he says we find Ireland called Scotia about the fall of the western empire And in his geography of the middle ages he puts Ireland as SCOTIA and says it bore that name long before it passed to present Scotland The most learned Schoepslin a German has also a Dissertation to shew this and especially marks that Ireland is the Scotia of Eginhart and other writers of Charlemagne's time  Comment Hist  Bas    to Add Suhm ap Gunlaugs Saga p Voltaire Hist Gen and Eecard de Orig Germ who says p "medii aevi scriptores quando Scotos nominant Hibernos intelligere"  A dispute indeed alike disgraceful to the learning and veracity of our antiquists and supported on their side only by chicanery and railing and on the other by nu∣merous  and clear testimonies required no penetra∣tion but only a free mind to settle This fanati∣cism of our scriblers for a name is only a woful proof of the most illiterate and vulgar prejudice Of the great nations of antiquity the conduct on this subject was just the reverse and to him who considers the vast ΝΟΥΣ the mental vigour of the Greek and Roman writers it will not be difficult to decide on which side the defect of science and understanding lies The Greeks gloried in hav∣ing many appellations  Pelasgi Hellenes Achaii Danai  c c nay laterly adopted the Roman term  Graeci  without repining The Romans termed themselves  Quirites Latini  c  But let us examine the origin of this mighty Abraxas of this term  Scoti  which has turned the brains of our antiquists and made our history a mass of fable Even in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries this redoubtable shibboleth was confined to the part of present Scotland north of Forth and Clyde On the south of these rivers the Piks re∣tained their old name and possessed the most fer∣tile quarter of Scotland These facts are clear from all the writers on the War of the Standard The  Galweienses vel Picti  reached from Solway to the frith of Clyde And in Scotish Lothian from Tweed to Forth was the prime resi∣dence of the southern Piks whence that country is termed  Pictorum Provincia  by Beda and what some writers on the war of the Standard ascribe to the Piks the honour of leading the Scotish army Brompton gives to the  Lodonenses  Roger of Ches∣ter says Edinburgh is  in terra Pictorum  'in Pik∣land' and the modern name of a range of hills in present Lothian  Pentland hills  marks the Pikish possession as clearly is Pentland frith or Pictland frith still so called in the time of James V Sir David Dalrymple also justly remarks that in the name of Scotti is mentioned as very confined  Indeed even on the north of Forth and Clyde the Norwegians held Caithness Sutherland the Ork∣neys and Hebudes amounting to another quarter of present Scotland So that only half of present Scotland was inhabited by people called Scoti even in the thirteenth century Nay even of that half the  Moravienses  or inhabitants of the large province of Moray bounded by Spey and Locha∣ber and Athole on the east and south and by the Norwegian dominions on the north were not  Scoti  but  Picti  down to the thriteenth century as appears from Fordun and others And the people of ancient Argyle or the kingdom of Dalriada were not  Scoti  but  Gadeli  as the  Chronicon Picto∣rum  and the  Descriptio Albaniae  shew  Thus it is certain from cotemporary records that in the thirteenth century the name  Scoti  only belonged to the inhabitants of five provinces of Scotland  Buchan Angus Athole Strathern Fife  or in other words only extended from the Spey and Kinnaird's Head north to the Forth south and from Braidalbin west to the British or Ger∣man ocean east When the reader reflects how it after passed without conquest to the rest of Scot∣land it is believed he will be apt to suspect the same true of its first appearance and that it was as arbitrary first as last  To trace its first appearance we must recur to the different inhabitants of that tract where it be∣gan namely the Dalreudini and Piks  The people who came from Ireland and settled in Argyle called themselves  Dalreudini  as Beda expressly tells us This fact is also clear from Tighernac and other ancient Irish writers who term them  Dalriadi  and their country  Dalriada  Those modern highlanders who say they never gave themselves this name because they have not done so lately only shew what a strange affair a Celtic understanding is The people of Middle∣sex sex have not called themselves Saxons but Eng∣lish  for these eight centuries and yet nothing is more certain than that they called themselves Saxons down to the tenth century These people indigenally and vulgarly called  Dalriadach  were also termed  Scoti Britanniae Scoti in Britannia  by such of their own writers and others as used Latin as for instance Adomnan uses the first ex∣pression Beda the later Indigenally the Dalriadi also termed themselves  Gaclach  as their Irish an∣cestors did being a generic name of the Celts Thus they are specially termed  Gaedeli  in the  Chronicon Pictorum  and in the  Descriptio Albaniae  and the old name of  Ard Gael  belongs to their chief settlement from its most ancient date But by no other names were they known either among themselves or by others in ancient times The modern name they give themselves of  Albanach  anciently belonged to the Piks as shall presently be shewn and was assumed by the Dalreudini after their union with the Piks as the Burgun∣dians c since their coalescence with France are called French and as the Scots call themselves Britons since their union with England  The Piks as is clear from the writings of king Alfred the Saxon Chronicle Witichind c called themselves  Pihtar Pehtar Peohtar  pro∣nounce this last as in Icelandic  Peuhtar  and in modern language of Scotland and the north of England  Pehts  by later Icelandic writers they are termed  Pets  The Romans unluckily Latinized this name  Picti  The Cumraig Britons termed them  Phichtiaid  The Irish who are fond of pa∣tronymics called them after their first king Cru∣then by the name of  Cruitnich  Their country they termed  Tir Cruitnich  The Land of the Cruit∣nich and from the royal residence  Fortrin  as the Welch called the king of England king of Lon∣don The Icelanders called it  Petland  the Eng∣lish  Peohtlond  natives  Pehtland  But there can be no question that  Albani  was an appellation also belonging to the Piks and in every  probability indigenal  Alban  was as would seem the name which the Piks gave to Britain or at least to their part of it for i can never find it ap∣plied to present England either in ancient or mo∣dern times and they who upon this occasion dream of the Greek name Albion should be re∣ferred to Swift's etymologies Adomnan indeed translates  Drum Alban Dorsum Britanniae  but it is certain that all Irish and Welch writers confine the name of  Alban  to the north of Britain At the same time it is very probable that  Alban  was the name given by the Cumri to Britain in gene∣ral as  Brettan  was by the Belgae and that the Piks finding their country so called by its first in∣habitants retained the appellation Thus as they were not only Piks by a peculiar and proper ap∣pellation but also Britons as inhabitants of Bri∣tain so they were  Albani  as dwelling in  Alban  At the same time we must reflect that this name  Albani  is common to highlanders in many coun∣tries peopled by Scythae or Goths as the Albani on Caucasus those of Macedon and Italy This circumstance leads to suspect that the name is really Gothic  Torfaeus Hist Norv I mentions  Mor Alban  in Scan∣dinavia In German any high hills are called  Alben  or  Alps  Eccard Orig Germ "  Albe  pro monte qui cano jugo conspi∣cuus est five also vox est in superiore Germania usitatissima"  Id  See also Huetiana p  and was given by the Piks to their own mountainous country It is possible also that the Belgae of Ireland fronting the mountains of Wales called Britain  Alban  and that from them the Greek mariners coming from the south and first touching at Ireland might receive it However this be there is no ground whatever to infer that the name of  Albani  was ever in ancient times assumed by the Dalreudini or present Cel∣tic highlanders Adomnan tells us that  Drum Al∣ban  or  Dorsum Britanniae  as he translates it lay between th  Scots in Britain and the Piks If  Alban  be thus translated Britain or if confined to North Britain it is equally clear that the Dalreu∣dini who held so small a corner had no claim to the style of  Albanach  by eminence On the con∣trary as that appellation is always found among Gothic nations there is room to infer that  Alban  and  Albani  were indigenal terms among the Piks who gave them to their territory and to them∣selves from situation in it So the Dalreudini afterward called themselves  Albanach  from their situation in Pikland tho originally  Gael  There is no room to deny that the Piks might have a peculiar and also a territorial appellation as well as the Dalreudini Cumri or other nations in Bri∣tain and in all other countries The Belgae and Franks were thus  Galli  the Celtiberi Suevi c  Hispani  Tighernac palpably implies  Albain  to be synonymous with Pikland for at he calls Donal king of  Albain  as he does his successors tho all his predecessors he terms kings of the Piks The Duan also puts the Cumri as first possessors of  Albain  and then the Piks It certainly follows from this that the Piks as inhabitants of  Alban  were  Albani  and from Tighernac it is clear that king of the Piks and king of Albain were terms as perfectly synonymous as king of the Scots and king of Scotland These matters considered it will appear as ridiculous to infer that because our highlanders now term themselves Albanach they were the ancient Albanach as to infer that be∣cause the people of Bretagne now call themselves French they were the original Franci  These arguments admit of strong reinforcement It is allowed by all that  Albani  and  Scotti  are syno∣nymous in writers of the eleventh  Scotland is called Albania by a Welch writer about the year See Usher's Epist Hib Sylloge Geofrey of Monmouth always calls Scotland Albania and says it was so called when the Piks came from Scythia to it After mentioning the Pikish arrival he says 'Sed hoc hactenus cum non proposuerim historiam eorum SIVE Scottorum trac∣tare qui ex illis et Hiberniensibus originem duxerunt' This passage shews that in Geofrey's time the annihilation of the Piks was unknown and that the modern Scots were considered as Piks  Caledonii Picti Albani Scoti were synonymous as were Attacotti Dalriadi Gadeli Hibernenses and Belgae Angli Saxones Loegrii The Welch term  Loegr  for the Saxons seems from  Lloeg merces  as they were at first mercenarie  See Gildas Beda Davis Dict Kymb  twelfth and  thirteenth centuries Roger Hoveden de∣scribing the war of the Standard says  Excla∣mavitque simul exercitus Scottorum insigne patrium et ascendit clamor usque in coelum Albani Albani  The Duan and the  Descriptio Albaniae  fully con∣firm this Yet however it may suprize the read∣er it is evident from writers of that time that the  Gadeli  or  Gael  of  Dalriada  or Argyle are not the Scots of those times but especially distinguished from them The  Chronicon Pictorum  calls the eas∣tern inhabitants of Scotland uniformly  Scoti  but the western  Gaedeli  by a special distinct name The  Descriptio Albaniae  says  Montes qui dividunt Scociam ab Arregaithel  'the mountains which di∣vide Scotland from Argyle' and it after speaks of Argyle as possessed by the  Gaeli  or  Hibernenses  quite a different people from the Scots And it shall presently be shewn that the Scots of the ele∣venth century and of this day are quite a differ∣ent people from the British Scots of Adomnan and Beda It therefore follows that as our highlanders were not the Scots of the eleventh and succeeding centuries so neither were they the Albani This fact is also evident from the names of places in ancient Buchan Angus Athole Strathern Fife or all that region which first bore the modern name of  Scotia  for they are Gothic not Gaelic And that name  Scotia  came in place of  Albania  The author of the  Gesta Stephani R Ang  a cotemporary published by Du Chesne Rer Norm Sc says "Est autem Scotia quae et Albania dicitur regio locis palustribus cir∣cumsepta silvarum fertilium lactis et armentorum copiosa portubus salubribus insulis opulentis circumcincta sed in∣colas barbaros habens et impuros nec nimio frigore fractos nec aspera fame detritos citis pedibus lenique armaturae confidentes anxium amare mortis exitum pro nihilo ducen∣tes inter suos domesticos sed inter sibi extraneos omnes cru∣delitate excedentes'  Baldred Bisset in his memoir to the Pope on Scotish history says "in ejusdemque locum Albaniae successit nomen novum Scotiae" and after "Ergadiam adjacentem ipsi Al∣baniae" Fordun II so that Argyle was not even regarded as in Albany or Pikland  as the  Descriptio Albaniae  restifies so that neither the country nor its inhabitants received their names from our highland Albanach who use the Celtic tongue only For the real  Alban  was in the east and possessed by the Piks The Welch fables concerning Camber Locrine and Albanact also infer the Piks to have been the Albani as the Saxons were the Locrini or  Loegr  The Elegiac Chronicle of our kings written in the th cen∣tury also marks Pikland as Albania  Primus in Albania fertur regnasse Kenedus  whereas  Primus in Ergadia Fergus rexit tribus annis  Thus we find Albany opposed to Argyle and the former synonymous with Pikland as the  De∣scriptio Albaniae  says it was first called  Albania  then  Pictavia  Upon the whole it appears that the Piks called their country  Alban  and them∣selves  Albanr  or Albani either  from its mountains as the other Gothic Albani in Asia Macedon Italy  Or from their finding it so called by the Cumri the old inhabitants whom they expelled or adopting it from their Cumraig neighbours on the south  Or lastly as taught to assume this name by their Irish and Cumraig churchmen their only literati  The names  Scoti  and  Scotia  Scot and Scot∣land claim next and last consideration Tho the Dalreudini were as abovementioned termed by writers in Latin  Scoti in Britannia  and  Scoti Bri∣tanniae  yet those inhabitants of Argyle were so few and insignificant that only Adomnan and Beda mark them by that appellation From the reign of Aidan they gradually diminished as fully shewn above in power and fame and after being vanquished by Ungust they became almost unknown in history till this day Tho ri∣diculous fables concerning their conquest of the Piks have been amply exposed before and no∣thing is more certain than that after Beda they are known to no writer by the name of Scoti or Scots As for the modern Scots who are quite a different people of different language the Gothic there is no fact more certain in human history than that they did not bear that name till about the year  It has been shewn above from numerous testi∣monies invincible even by those who set all re∣gard for truth at defiance that Ireland was called  Scotia  and its ruling people Scoti from the first appearance of these names down to the eleventh century But that present Scotland was called  Scotia  or its people  Scoti  before the eleventh century not so much as  one  single authority can be produced The people of North Britain ap∣pear by the name of Caledonians or Piks from the time of Tacitus down to the tenth century Ta∣citus Ptolemy Dion Cassius Eumenius Clau∣dian Gildas Adomnan Beda Nennius Asser Tighernae form a chain of indissoluble autho∣rities on this matter and as their testimonies have been separately quoted in this work they need not be here repeated  If the laws of the Conqueror published by Selden Spe∣cil ad Eadmer be genuine the Piks were even about regarded as a powerful people Ingulfus at the year mentions them as fighting under Constantin In the  Clerici Pictorum  occur Acta Edithae apud Sur Radulf Abp of Canterbury in the th century calls the bishop of Candida Casa  episcopus Pictorum  Ser X col  Nennius in  describes the Piks as quite in the same power and situation as Beda found them King Alfred in his paraphrases of Beda Orosius c would have noted any change had any occurred since Beda's time Asser who wrote his life of Alfred in the beginning of the tenth century tells us that the Danes preyed on the Piks and StratclydeWelch from their camp in Northumberland Not one writer before the eleventh century affords the smallest hint of any change in Pikland The Saxon Chronicle written in the eleventh or twelfth century sometimes calls Ireland  Scotland  and sometimes gives North Britain the same ap∣pellation of Scotland but laterly In it is pre∣served a poem on the victory of Athelstan over our Constantin and in every appearance written instantly after the event but there is not a trace in that poem of the names  Scot Scotland  being applied to North Britain On the contrary it constantly gives them to Ireland Anlaf or Olave the Red king of the Scandinavians in Ire∣land and thence called  Scota konungr  'king of Scots' in the Icelandic accounts was the chief party at the battle of Brunenburg Both Irish and Icelandic accounts agree perfectly in this and it is remarkable that none of these accounts make the least mention of our Constantin upon this occasion He seems merely to have lent his own presence for the Piks his subjects had no skill in seaaffairs and Olave's fleet was in every appearance wholly filled with Scandinavians and Scots of Ireland The Saxon poem of course speaks of  Flottan an Sceotta  'the Scottish mari∣ners' and dwells almost entirely on the Scots or Irish and  Nordmans  or Scandinavians Constan∣tin  it terms  Nord Constantinus  'the Northern Constantin' but never calls him Scotish or his men Scots The poem also says  Guma Norderna  Ofer scyld scoten  'The Northern men under their shields with spears' This expression seems to apply to Con∣stantin's subjects as he is himself called  Nord  and in all other places the Scandinavians are called  Nordmanna  not  Norderna  The North Bri∣tons were also remarkable for spears even from their earliest history But this is submitted to the reader Certain it is from this poem and from the Icelandic accounts that the name of  Scots  at this period belonged solely to the Irish and they who are the most bigotted on the other side will not insist that in we Scots were sub∣jected to the Norwegians as Du Chesne's histo∣rian says or that in Olave was our king as the Icelandic writers bear In the other Icelandic poems and traditions relating to events preced∣ing the eleventh century the names  Skota  and  Skotland  generally belong to Ireland Thus in Ragnar's deathsong  Skotland  is Ireland and in the Ransom of Egil Eric a Danish king of Northumbria is called 'Commander of the Scotish fleet' because he had commanded that of the Scandinavians in Ireland Saxo Grammati∣cus fabulously says Ragnar Lodbrog subdued  Sco∣tia  and  Petia  that is Ireland and Pikland or present Scotland But there not being an Icelandic or Scandinavian piece extant preceding the ele∣venth century save a few poems and traditions it is no wonder that Scotland generally appears in such late writers as now accepted and that many of these writers confound Ireland with Scot∣land  There being thus not  one  authority for the pre∣sent Scots being known by that name till the  eleventh century none but mere dreamers and romancers can assert the contrary in despite of plain truth and reason and every rule of history But that the name of Scots was used in its pre∣sent acceptation in the eleventh century is cer∣tain and they who would make it yet later err on the other side Turgot confessor of queen Margaret wrote her life in the end of the ele∣venth century and calls her husband Malcom III king of Scots The Saxon Chronicle apparently written under William Rufus also accepts Scots as now toward the end of the work and applies that name as usual to the people after so called even before its present application Macbeth is called  rex Scotorum  in a charter if genuine  Ruddiman Introd ad Dipl Scotiae  So is indeed a Malcom but doubtful if the Second in the charter of Murtlach whose very existence is however dubious Marianus Scotus who wrote about calls Ireland  Scotia  but at calls the present Scots  Scoti  On the whole the reign of Malcom II till is the proper aera of this new name and taking the middle of his reign it appeared about In Ireland and Scotland were known by their present names even in Egypt  Geogr Nub Climat part    Having thus adjusted the real date of this name it remains to trace its origin Two questions only arise on this subject  If the later Scots or those of North Britain after received their name from the  Scoti Bri∣tanniae  of Adomnan and Beda  If on the contrary the later Scoti were quite a different people and the name proceeded from another cause  The first question must be answered in the ne∣gative for the Scots of the eleventh century were as different a people from those of Adomnan  and Beda as the Hungarians are from the Huns or the Marcomanni of Tacitus from the Marco∣manni of Rabanus Maurus The old Scots used the Celtic tongue and came from Ireland to Dal∣riada or Argyle The later Scots used the Gothic tongue and came from Scandinavia being the very same people before called Piks There was certainly no revolution in North Britain in the time of Malcom II and yet the name first appears then The name was at first confined to the mid∣dle of the eastern part of Scotland as above shewn and as it spred over the rest without revolution so it is certain it began without revolution Had it proceeded from Kenneth's bearing the Pikish sceptre it would have begun then but on the contrary he and his successors are called kings of the Piks then kings of Albany then kings of the Scots Giraldus or whoever wrote the  Descriptio Albanioe  had his information from Andrew bishop of Caithness and was cer∣tainly well informed as to it's then state He tells us Albany was called Scotia CORRUPTE 'corruptly' Had the old Scots vanquished the Piks as fabled the name was proper not cor∣rupt The same writer affords clear evidence that the old Scots of Beda did not impart their name to the later Scots but had on the contrary lost their own and were not regarded as Scots when the later name began For he says  Montes qui dividunt Scociam ab Arregaithel  'the moun∣tains which divide Scotland from Argyle' and he tells us the people of Argyle were  Hybernenses  whereas he gives no hint that the later  Scotti  were so but on the contrary his special mention that the people of Argyle were  Hibernenses  or Irish sufficiently implies that the later Scoti were not any more than the Moravienses Lodonenses Gal∣weienses who were all afterward called Scots So also in the  Chron Pictorum  the Dalreudini or Scots of Beda are called  Gadeli  as a special dis∣tinction  from the  Scoti  the name there given to the eastern people or Piks This shews the radical mistake of our fabulists who confound the old Scoti with the later as Olahus and other Hun∣garian fabulists take the Huns for the Hungarians Moreover the old English writers on the war of the standard mention the  Scoti  along with the Galweienses Lodonenses c These Scots were certainly not Highlanders a people always despised as mere savages by our monarchs but the people from Forth to Moray as Sir David Dalrymple observes in his Annals Their offensive arms were spears the known weapons of the Low∣land Scots in later times The Highlanders are called  Hibernenses  and so Barbour calls them  Erischry  'Irish' and our other writers to this day term their language  Erse  or Irish Even in or the century after the first ap∣pearance of the later name of Scots the High∣landers or old Scots of Beda are specially distin∣guished as a different people from the later Scots so that it is clear that the later Scots were not so called because the same identic people with the old Scots of Britain or even incorporated with them seeing that the old Scots actually were not called Scots when this name was first given to the later Scots but on the contrary were termed Irish as a sufficient distinction from the later Scots who were not Irish This plain account may occasion a smile at the Scotish and Irish antiquists who have fought so long about what none of them understood for as the Scots of Ireland did not proceed from Britain so the present Scots did not come from Ireland This discovery was as unexpected by me as the failure of the Dalriadic line a century before Kenneth and as i have on a former occasion expressed the contrary of both these points  Essay on the Origin of Scotish Poetry prefixt to Ancient Scotish Poems from the Ma  tland Collection London  before i had  fully examined them i hope every reader will ac∣quit me of all prejudice Indeed the matter is so unimportant that i can hardly conceive how any prejudice can arise upon it  The second question is of course answered in the affirmative namely that the later and present Scots are quite a different people from the  Scoti Britanniae  of Adomnan and Beda and their name proceeded not from any conquest or coalescence with the old  Scoti  but from some other cause This cause in fact marked them not as the  same  but as a  different  people as above shewn The name began in North Britain on the east between Forth and Moray while the old Scots of Argyle were regarded as  Hibernenses  not as  Scoti  And the country where the name first began had been ever regarded as the prime seat of the Piks who continued its possessors as the names and lan∣guage and people of that tract always were and are Gothic But how came this new name of Scots to be given to a central part of the Piks around the king's residence It is answered just as the name of Scots originally arose in Ireland The whole little learning of Pikland lay among the Irish clergy for Ireland as it supplied Eng∣land and even France with many clergy so it supplied almost all the clergy of Pikland Hyona was indeed the supreme cathedral of Pikland as Beda tells and all know and Hyona was fur∣nished with abbots c from Ireland The Piks a northern Gothic nation despised holiness and the learning then in vogue as long as their ancestors of Scandinavia and there is not one Pikish saint or writer on record This clearly evidences that their clergy or only literati must have been Irish And there is every reason to be∣lieve that the name  Scoti  was given them by their Irish clergy for one of these two reasons or both The Dalreudini tho originally mixt with Goths yet from intermarriages in Ireland  and constant intercourse with that kingdom be∣came almost quite Celtic or at least certainly used the Celtic tongue from the beginning In that tongue the Scythians or Goths were called Scots as fully explained above and as the Celts call themselves by generic names so they natu∣rally gave a generic name to the Piks who were Scythians or Scots And thus as the wild Irish were at first termed  Hibernenses  and their Gothic conquerors  Scoti  so the wild Highlanders and their Gothic neighbours fell into the very same distinctions of  Hibernenses  and  Scoti  But it seems more probable that the Irish church∣men did not receive this novelty from the vulgar but gave rise to it themselves For discovering from Beda and others that the Piks were Scy∣thae and from Nennius and Irish chronicles that the name Scythae was synonymous with Scoti they would naturally give their favorite term to the Piks as real Scythae or Scoti Other causes might concur  Picti  was but an odd name for a people and the practice of staining the body was considered as Pagan and the very memory of it to be abolished The real word from which this was latinized  Pihtar  or  Pehtar  never oc∣curred as such but the second meaning  painted  was odious in every view  Pehts  was a harsh word to latinize tho had Witichind fallen in the way of these people perhaps REX PEHI∣TORUM might have remained to the lasting clearness of our history But  Albani  was lyable to none of these objections yet having never been used by Roman writers as applicable to the Scots it ob∣tained no notice Personal vanity might also in∣duce the Irish clergy to give their beloved name  Scoti  to their Pikish laity But it was certainly the very worst name that could have been given as it belonged to a neighbouring country and the confusion it has introduced into our his∣tory is eternal and irremediable The new Scots  were however more properly so than the old as they preserved their Scythic or Gothic lan∣guage and the name was so far curious as in Ire∣land and Scotland it formed an extreme western bound for the Scythic settlements in Europe as Ancient Scythia on the Euxine did the extreme eastern bound of these settlements That the name of Scots was given to the Piks because it was observed that the later were really Scythae as the former were originally is not merely a plau∣sible conjecture but actually rests upon an ancient and valuable monument of our history For the  Chronicon Regum Pictorum  whose perfect concord∣ance with all the best and most ancient English and Irish writers renders it the most valuable of all our historic fragments as fully shewn before has a preface shewing the identity of the Piks Scythae Scoti This Chronicle is certainly one of our most ancient monuments and written in or before the eleventh century for after that time the new name  Scoti  had such a pernicious effect that the history of the Piks became a sacrifice to that of the old  Scoti  who had no concern with the new  Scoti  The preface to it seems fully to evidence the reasons that led to change the name of  Picti  for  Scoti  It tells that the  Picti  were so called from staining their bodies in which as in other points it gives the very words of Isidorus whose etymologies are so risible The author never reflected that  Pihtar  the vulgar name for the Piks could only be latinized  Picti  and that the meaning of the later word was foreign to the question and that Isidorus never heard of the in∣digenal name but gave at random an etymology indeed plausible if compared with his others for his work in this view is a perpetual fund of laughter The preface then says the  Scoti  are so called "quasi Sciti quia a Scythia regione vene∣runt" Then the arrival of the Britons is noted in the words of Nennius as is that of the Scots or  Scythae in Ireland It is added  Gentes Scitiae albo crine nascuntur ab assiduis nivibus et ipsius capilli color genti nomen dedit et inde dicuntur Al∣bani de quibus originem duxerunt Scotti et Picti  'The nations of Scythia are born with white hair because of the perpetual snow and the colour of their hair gave the name of Albani White to the nation from which the Scots and Piks drew their origin' This curious passage shews that the Piks were called  Albani  and that they and the Scots were reputed of common origin as Scythae The Chronicle then remarks on the Asiatic Albani and the Gothi Gethae or Scythae and Daci and gives a long account of Ancient Scythia on the Euxine chiefly in the words of Isi∣dorus This preface is very curious as it shews the then state of learning in Pikland Isidorus was the favorite author there as in Ireland where the etymology of  Ibernia  from  Iberia  was first discovered from him and all the Milesian fables built upon that basis Perhaps the perver∣sion both of Irish and of Scotish ancient history springs solely from one foolish book the  Origines  of Isidorus Such are human affairs I suspect that Isidorus is the sole father of the new name of Scoti given to the Piks and that the following sen∣tence ruined the history of Pikland  Scoti propria lingua nomen habent a picto corpore eo quod aculeis ferreis cum atramento variarum figurarum stigmate an∣notantur  Orig lib IX p edit Paris fol 'The Scots are so called in their own lan∣guage from painting their bodies because they are marked in various figures with iron needles and ink  With this very passage the  Chron Pictorum  begins only for  Scoti  is put  Picti  After this who could doubt that  Scoti  and  Picti  were but different names for the same people And is it a wonder that the Irish priests gave their favorite name  Scoti  to the Piks  CHAPTER V  Manners and Antiquities of this Period from    till    WHAT is said in the former volume con∣cerning the manners and antiquities of the Piks may be also generally referred to this period The manners even of the Lowlanders continued very barbarous as might be expected among a people shut up in a corner of a remote iland from the advantages of intercourse with southern and civilized nations The meek tem∣per of Christianity while it perhaps too much emolliated the manners of southern nations had the most beneficial effects upon the ferocity of the northern But nothing can more strongly mark the poverty of Scotland than the fewness of her episcopal sees and great churches pre∣ceding the reign of David I Abernethy Dunkeld and St Andrews were founded before as formerly narrated and it seems remark∣able that we find no valid authority for any other religious foundation preceding the year  The Chron Pict mentions that Kenneth IV gave Bre∣chen to the church Does this imply that a church was founded there or that he gave it to a church already founded as Dunkeld c  Had any such taken place our old lists could never have been totally silent on the subject  The manners of the North Britons at this pe∣riod can only be studied in those of the Scandi∣navians to be found in different Icelandic au∣thors and which we may safely regard as pa∣rallel to those of their brethren in Pikland But  so much has been said upon this subject in the former volume that i shall not enlarge upon it here but shall content myself with adding a few remarks upon such ancient monuments in Scot∣land as seem peculiar to this period  Of these the buildings vulgarly called Piks Houses form a remarkable instance They are of a conic form and of two kinds  First  the small which consist of a hall or large apartment in the middle with places for beds on the sides as usual among the Icelanders and other Goths  See Gunlang's Saga and the plates in it  At about the height of twelve feet the wall converges into a conic arch with a hole in the center to emit the smoke  Secondly  the large which have walls thirty or forty feet high as yet remaining but converge not to a point at the top tho parts of the wall seem still of the original height  The first are infallibly the most ancient and are now only found in the northern extremities of Scotland where there was no temptation to use their stones for fences or other civilized purposes A good description and print of such may be found in Mr Pennant's third volume The walls are of prodigious thickness piled with dry stones but with considerable art I am almost tempted to think that Arthur's Oven a Roman work fur∣nished our rude ancestors with a hint for such buildings being a similar fabric with a hole in the roof but of far superior art and neatness These castles tho rude and small were certainly only used by the chiefs or the rich while the common people had wooden or turf huts They as well as the next are seldom found on hills but are generally in glens and by the sides of waters  The second or large castles are of a construc∣tion quite singular The walls as they yet re∣main are often from thirty to forty feet high  and the central area of as great diameter There are two walls the inner of which rises erect the outer generally at the bottom four or five feet distant from the other gradually verges inward till it joins The outer wall has no windows or holes at all except a small door The inner has windows sometimes large with stone shelves running across sometimes very small Between the walls is a rude staircase running to the top and two or three galleries five or six feet high pass above each other all around between the walls except where interrupted by the rude stair∣case The middle space formed one great round hall open at the top and there is no mark of any floors as indeed even in later times halls were often thirty to forty feet high  See Gordon's Itin Sept Pennant's Tour Archaeologia vols V VI Cordiner's Antiquities  These large castles are more common than the small and are even numerous in the north of Scotland and in the Hebudes and Orkneys Particularly in the vale of Glenelg near Bernera on the west of Invernessshire there are no less than four Dun Dornadilla is a remarkable one in that most unknown corner of Scotland the North West ex∣tremity around the Cape called  Hvarf  by the Norwegians and now corruptly  Wrath  It seems to have received its name from a female possessor  Dornagilla a common female name  as for king Dornadilla he is a nonexistence and of the family of Gargantua Perhaps indeed the parson of the parish after Boyce's fables ap∣peared told the people that this must have been a residence of Dornadilla the great hunter and they preserve this information by pious tradition But it is foolish to reason upon traditional names or any thing belonging to tradition else we might conclude Arthur's Oven to be justly so called  Mr King regards these edifices as the rudi∣mental forms of Gothic castles They evidently belong to this period of our history and were followed by the square tower such as the castle of Oldwick The Norman lords who acquired possessions in Scotland in the twelfth and thir∣teenth centuries must have introduced the com∣plete Norman castle In the North of Scotland and the Orkneys these conic edifices are called Piks Houses In the Hebudes the same kind of forts in all respects are called Danish and in Scotland the vulgar ascribe many antiquities to the  Pehts  in which they had no share Nothing can indeed be founded on tradition which is al∣ways uncertain if not always false and it is even beneath a severe writer once to mention it There is one circumstance which strongly indi∣cates these forts Norwegian namely that they extend over the Orkneys Hebudes Caithness Sutherland and Ross and are found in no other part of Scotland That is they are found ex∣actly in those very parts which were held by the Norwegians A local invention might take place among the Norwegians in Scotland and not ex∣tend to their other possessions But at the same time it must be reflected that not many of these forts exist even in the north of Scotland excluding the Orkneys and Hebudes And if any are found in the east and south where the Grampians and other hills afford glens enough for their erection and preservation the claim of the Piks must come in In the Appendix to Mr Pennant's third volume p is mention of the founda∣tions of several such circular buildings existing in one spot near Perth But certainly some must be found as entire in the east and south as in the north if really Pikish works As the case stands i must say that they appear to me Norwegian upon the model of the smaller sort which  seem Pikish and far more ancient as above men∣tioned  At Sualsberg near Drontheim Norway there is one of these conic edifices Pennant II The castle of Yms∣borg Westrogothia seems another Dahlberg Suecia Ant et Hod tom III But i question if there be any resem∣blance but in figure the double walls galleries shelves c being wanting  Much has been lately said and written concerning some vitrified forts discovered in Scotland Some believed that Ossian was the builder and some that the infernal monarch had baked them with his own fire At length a letter ap∣peared in the Edin Mag Sept written as i am in∣formed by George Dempster Esq whose name implies every praise of a patriot and a man which discovered that these vi∣trified forts belong to the thirteenth century The authority is Sir Robert Gordon of Gordon stown in his history of the Sutherland Family folio MS p of the Geographical De∣scription of Sutherland "Dun Creigh was built with a strange kynd of morter by one Paull Macktyre This I doe take to be a kynd of ore howsoever this is most certaine that ther hath not been seen ane harder kynd of morter" Again p of the Genealogie of the Earls of Sutherland "Paull Macktyre was a man of great power and possessions" between and as appears from dates inserted "In his time he possessed the lands of Creigh in Sutherland and built a house called Down Creigh with such a kynd of hard mort  r that at this day it cannot be known wherof it was maid As he was building this house and fortresse he had intelligence that his onlie son was slain in Catteynes in company with one Murthow Rea ane outlaw and valiant captane in these dayes which made him desist from further building when he had almost finished the same There are many things fabulouslie reported of this Paull Macktyre amougst the vulgure people which I doe omit to relate" Sir Rob Sibbald's MSS  d Lib have in his  Vera Suther∣landiae Descriptio  "Varia sunt hic castellaDown Crigh a quodam Paulo Mactiro extructum suit"    A great singularity attending these edifices is that in Glenelg on the western extremity of In∣vernessshire opposite to the He of Skey were no less than four of them within the extent of one mile If we suppose them forts of defence garri∣soned against an enemy or residences of chiefs this proximity is alike puzzling and contrary to the practice of all ages and countries If garri∣sons they could neither have been placed so  near nor have stood in glens the very worst situ∣ation Antiquaries and commentators generally pass over difficult passages without even a hint and it is therefore no wonder that no writer on the subject has attempted to explain this But from the proximity and sheltered situation of some of these edifices such would appear winter retreats of the richer class of inhabitants with their retainers For we are not to suppose that among the Piks or Norwegians Gothic nations not split into breeds or clans the case was the same as among the Celts whose chiefs were kings and the clan beggars and slaves without property or possession Among the ancient Ger∣mans arable land belonged to the tribe and not to individuals as we learn from Tacitus And pastureground as the Highlands of Scotland must have been common to the society of the district but individuals were wealthy in propor∣tion to their herds and flocks That unique work  Islands Landnamabok  or The Book of Icel  ndic Origins being the only one containing a full and minute display of the settlement of a barbaric colony throws great light on the state of property among the Norwegians in the ninth century Individuals had numerous flocks of sheep and of swine wandering on the mountains while their few horses and cattle were carefully kept near home and shut up at night in turf sta∣bles adjoining to the house Many were rich in this primitive wealth and the poor were free and industrious and had their voice in the national council when the wealthy did not forget that they were men The rich pretended not to be tyrants but lived in concord and subjection to the laws It also appears from that work that the numerous storemen or rich had summer resi∣dences  Sumer segea  p c  and winter residences the former on  the hills the later in sheltered glens and some∣times so near each other as to form little towns Friendship family connections and mutual de∣fence and intercourse naturally occasioned such instances The mountainous lands being free pasture there was no room for an estate with a castle as in later times of fixt and hereditary pro∣perty When the state of society therefore is considered the propinquity of these castles will not be matter of surprize and it is observable that they are called  Duns  in the Highlands the Gothic word for a  Town  the later being a slight alteration of it as in the Gothic D and T are of∣ten interchanged In Scotland a farmhouse with outhouses or two or three standing near each other are called  towns  by the common people to this day  At Dunrobin a seat of the earls of Sutherland one of these Pik's houses as vulgarly called has several small ones of the same form communicat∣ing with the large  Archaeolog Vol V Williams p  These were apparently for more numerous servants and flocks belonging to the owner Castle Troddan Glenelg has a ruin∣ous building fronting the door and opening to∣ward it surely for flocks or herds for the door of the large ones is so small that a horse or cow could not enter so that adjacent receptacles were necessary for them This smallness of the door is an usual practice among barbaric nations per∣haps meant for more warmth and security or perhaps merely an erroneous custom for in most arts the best plan tho quite obvious is seldom lighted on at first  These buildings are interesting as specimens of the most ancient Gothic castles Mr King has considered them in this view and observes that Coninsburg castle Yorkshire the oldest in Eng∣land is a mere improvement of a Pikish  dun  But as Yorkshire was in antient Northumbria the great seat of the Danes i take Coninsburg to be Danish and not Saxon as Mr King infers  Another class of monuments some of which are perhaps as ancient as this period from till are the engraven obelisques Saxo tells us that Regnar Lodbrog about erected such stones in honour of his victories  Regnerus saxis rerum gestarum apices prae se serentibus hisdemque super  e locatis aeternum victoriae suae monumen∣tum affixit Saxo IX Such stones were called  Bautestene  Steph The oldest  certain  Runic inscriptions in Scandina∣via seem of Gormo king of Denmark A D Ib p As for the  apices  of Regner they seem  symbols  Wormius was often imposed on and his work is full of false inscriptions A runic forgery of Halpap  Hialmari Historia  imposed on Peringskiold and Hickes both of whom published it with great pomp and expence  and those in Scotland are sometimes ascribed to the Danes During the disastrous reign of Constantin II the Danes indeed ravaged in the very vi∣tals of Pikland In Olave wasted Pikland from New Year's Day till th March About the Danes remained a whole year in Pik∣land These events are preserved in the  Chron Pictorum  one of the most valuable records of our genuine history But these invaders came merely for spoil as appears from Tighernac and it is not to be supposed that they would be at the trouble and expence of erecting such artificial mo∣numents of their rapine In England and espe∣cially in Northumberland these spoilers remained fixt and yet have left no such monuments I therefore conclude with Mr Pennant that these remains belong to the Piks the inhabitants of the country But when Mr Pennant says III that no such stones are found in Scandinavia without Runic inscriptions he goes too far for in the edition of Saxo by Stephanius p three stones Nos are similar to the Pikish and without inscriptions not to name  other instances tho the Northern antiquaries have seldom thought those without inscriptions worth publishing And indeed the want of letters among the Piks cannot be enough regretted on every occasion of their history It must also be added that if these stones had been memorials of enemies the inhabitants would have eagerly de∣stroyed such trophies of their shame  In Scandinavia such stones are found of as late erection as the fifteenth century which is evi∣denced by their dates and there is room to infer that those in Scotland are far later than is gene∣rally imagined Upon looking into Mr Cordi∣ner's Antiquities it will be found that the figures on these obelisques are of the same style and kind with those on some tombstone which he produces remaining in and near churches known to have been founded in the twelfth century and which tombstones have like the obelisques no inscrip∣tions The obelisque near Forres is the most re∣markable and has been published by Mr Cor∣diner with laudable care Perhaps it was erected by Malcom IV upon his victories over the Mo∣ravians The common Scotish dress appears from it to have been a tunic with skirts girded round the waist Trousers or breeches were a luxury among the barbaric Goths and only used by the chiefs and it appears from Mr Strutt's plates that even among the common people in England breeches were not used till after the ele∣venth century The dress of the common Saxons is quite the same with that of the Scots on the obelisques at Forres The want of inscrip∣tions on those monuments is one proof among many of the slow progress of letters in Scotland  As national councils and courts of justice were held in the open air till late times there is room to infer that some of the stone circles foolishly called Druidic temples belong to this period  PART VI Ecclesiastic and Literary History  PART VI  Ecclesiastic and Literary History  CHAPTER I  Ecclesiastic History  THE grand intention of this work may be regarded as already fulfilled in the forgoing pages which it is hoped place our ancient his∣tory upon the perpetual basis of ancient authori∣ties or in other words of historic truth What shall be here added in this last Part and in the Supplement is rather illustrative than essential and shall therefore be more briefly treated than those radical points upon which the very exist∣ence of our history depends  In this chapter on our ancient Ecclesiastic His∣tory it is only proposed in the first place to offer a few remarks on the conversion of the people of North Britain to christianity and lastly to hint at the few events which can be recovered in chronologic order  Baronius expresses great wonder that the con∣version of the Scots in Britain should be totally omitted by Beda and by other ancient writers But when the simple light of truth is discovered it throws uniform splendor all around it and to him who has attended to the forgoing pages this wonder will totally cease Beda's Scots in Britain were but the inhabitants of Argyle a petty dis∣trict and were converted to christianity during their exile in Ireland from till Their conversion was beneath notice That of the inha∣bitants of North Britain the Piks after called Scots is sufficiently illustrated by Beda as its importance required  But our ignorant dreamers in a paroxysm of selflove for the Scotish name and confounding Beda's Scots in Britain with quite a different people the later and present Scots contend that Palladius was sent to the Scots in Britain as Pa∣trick was to the Irish I question if the very ex∣istence of the Scots in Britain that great people in Argyle was in the least known to the Pope who sent Palladius The Scots of Ireland since the heresy of Pelagius had been well known and attracted particular attention but the occasion re∣quires a few hints on the conversion of the Irish  Christianity had made some progress in Ireland before the mission of Palladius and Patrick and Nothing can evince this more clearly than the heresy of Pelagius which as Usher shews from collation of the best authorities broke out in Tho Pelagius was a Briton yet his apostle Celestius condemned in the Synod of Carthage was a  Scotus  or Irishman Hence St Je∣rome  who lived at this time calls the heresy of Pelagius  pullis Scotorum  'Scotish potage' and rails at it as peculiarly Scotish that is Irish Some Counsels also admonish against the  pultis Scotorum  The reader has seen above from the consent of all antiquity that the name  Scoti  belonged to the Irish alone till the eleventh century at which time by a caprice of chance it passed to the Piks or present Scots That Celestius was an Irishman follows of course and he became so illustrious a propagator of this heresy that as Augustin in∣forms it's followers were in his time called Celes∣tians not Pelagians The  pultis Scotorum  and similar expressions indicate that this heresy was not confined to one  Scotus  Celestius but that he had many followers of his own country At any rate it would be absurd to think that Celestius was the only  Scotus  who was a christian and it is on the contrary fair to conclude that by means of intercourse with Britain christianity had made some progress in Ireland in the fourth century But as Gildas testifies that even in his time the Britons were much addicted to paganism such seems to have been the case in Ireland down to St Patrick's time at least And christianity was not received by the kings till St Patrick's time so that it was liable to total expulsion till in his hands it became regal and universal He is there∣fore deservedly esteemed the apostle of Ireland  The Pelagian or Celestian heresy had excited great ferment in christendom and it is no wonder that it drew much attention of the bishop of Rome now aspiring to preeminent power toward the  Scoti  or Irish after whose name it was specially called Accordingly Pope Celestinus in sent Germanus a Gallic bishop to purge Britain of this heresy and in the same or next year sent Palladius a deacon of the Roman church to Ire∣land for the same purpose appointing him bishop of all the  Scoti  or Irish who believed in Christ  Germanus having performed his commission re∣turned to his own see of Autun in Burgundy Palladius after remaining a short time in Ireland left it and died in Britain on his return to Rome If we believe old authors of the life of St Patrick Palladius died in Pikland Others say he was martyred in Ireland others that he died in the territory of the Britons The first account name∣ly that he died in Pikland is the most singular but it seems likely that he passed over to Britain from the north of Ireland and died in Galloway held by Piks after as above shewn But the place and manner of his death is so uncertain that nothing can be built on it From Prosper we know that he was sent  ad Scotos  and that this name belonged solely to the Irish till the reader has seen above As for the Scots of Argyle they were certainly of importance and deserve to usurp the history of Ireland yet can nothing be more risible than the conduct of some of our an∣tiquists on this occasion They contend that the ancient church in Scotland was not subject to Roman bishops yet contend that Palladius was sent to them But national phrenzy is capable of any absurdity It suffices to observe on this sub∣ject that Palladius is quite unknown to the old and genuine monuments of our history Ninian Columba and in later times St Andrew are the only saintly patrons of our accounts Not a church was ever dedicated to Palladius in Scot∣land nor is there a trace of him in our history or tradition whereas Tighernac who wrote in and old writers of St Patrick's life with other Irish British and English old documents fix his mission to Ireland where his name was ever revered and consecrated by churches and popular tradition  It would seem that Palladius educated in the splendor of the Roman por  ificate found Ireland  in such a state of barbarism that he left it in order to acquaint the pope with its almost pagan condi∣tion and to procure assisting missionaries How∣ever this be after his death Patrick a native of Stratclyde was sent to Ireland in where he met with great success That Patrick succeeded Palladius in his function the restimonies of an∣cient writers are numerous and none of us has yet imagined that Patrick was sent to present Scot∣land so that the dreams of our antiquists on this as on other subjects not only shew an ignorance gross beyond example but are also so irrational as to defy reason while they defy truth  Another late dream of our antiquists is that Scotland was converted by eastern missionaries The cause of this profound idea is that those scriblers who pretend to treat our antiquities are so grossly ignorant even in this the eighteenth century as to confound the disputes between the church of Rome and those of Ireland and Scot∣land concerning the time of keeping Easter with those between the Roman and Eastern church In any other country schoolboys have more learning but in such a night of ignorance it is no wonder that all objects seem alike  The difference between the Roman and eastern church concerning Easter which began about the year lay in this The churches of Asia ob∣served this feast on the fourteenth moon upon whatsoever day of the week it fell out being the day on which the Jews offered their paschal lamb The church of Rome celebrated it on the Sunday following that day if it chanced not to fall on Sunday but did not as the eastern churches had from perpetual practice and tradition ever done celebrate Easter on a week day Thus the diffe∣rence between the Roman and Eastern church only consisted in  six days  at most and the only ques∣tion was whether Easter was to be celebrated on  the week day on which it fell or on the Sunday following  At the Council of Nice A D Asia was forced to follow the European mode and from that time till all the world kept Easter alike  Very different was the dispute between the Ro∣man church and those of Britain and Ireland concerning Easter It began in the sixth century upon this ground In Dionysius Exiguus a Roman priest introduced a great variation into the mode of computing Easter of which the tech∣nical terms would neither instruct nor entertain the reader Suffice it to say that his rule adopted by the Roman church threw the celebration of Easter a whole  month  further back than before But Britain and Ireland were as obstinate for their old Easter as they were lately for the old style and thus keeped Easter a whole month before the Roman church Cuminius who lived at the time specially mentions this difference of a month  Usser Sylloge p  and the dispute between the Roman and the Bri∣tish and Irish churches was not known till Au∣gustin the monk was sent to convert the Saxons in Adomnan  Lib l c  tells us that columba about prophesied concerning it Nothing can be more ridiculous therefore than to confound such different matters and the dreams concerning eastern missionaries all fall to the ground of course Indeed it was absurd to infer such a consequence at any rate for the Scots or Irish were converted by the British and the Piks or present Scotish by the Irish and British so that there was no occasion to go further than to the British for the variation of Easter And the British as we know from Euse∣bius in the time of Constantine I observed it in the same way as other western nations There is therefore no occasion to infer that the Britons were converted by eastern missionaries nor that  the Scots or Irish nor Piks or present Scots were seeing that the former were in the fourth century perfectly agreed with the Romans and the later two nations were converted by the former The variations of the Roman church were of far pos∣terior date and the Eastern church differed from the British as from the Roman even at the very first  Those fables being discussed it remains to state the truth concerning the conversion of the Piks or present Scots as narrated by Beda Lib III c We are there informed that in the year Columba came from Ireland to convert the northern Piks or those to the north of the Gram∣pian hills And upon this occasion Beda tells us that the Piks on the south of those hills had been converted by Ninian long before  multo ante tem∣pore  The time when Ninian lived is easily ad∣justed from his life written by Ailred the famous abbot of Reval about or translated from the Saxon and a copy of which from that in the Bodleian library is now before me It tells that Ninian in his return from Rome visited St Mar∣tin at Tours c  Floruit tune temporis beatissimus Martinus Turonicae civitatis episcopus cujus vita miraculis gloriosa jam ab eruditissimo viro sancto Sul∣picio descripta  c Beda also informs us that Ninian dedicated the church he built to St Mar∣tin and an old writer quoted by Usher says that he did this after he heard that St Martin whom he always much esteemed had left this life But St Martin as appears from the well known life of him by Sulpicius Severus and from many other testimonies flourished from to in which last year he died The learned and accurate Usher whose abilities in chronology are now universally acknowledged fixes the conversion of the southern Piks by Ninian at the year  Our antiquists who certainly bear the palm of ignorance from all others in Europe suppose the  southern Piks converted by Ninian to have been in Galloway because Beda says the church and episcopal see of Ninian was at Whithern in Gal∣loway There were no Piks in Galloway till at soonest Galloway in Ninian's time was in the province of Valentia and possessed by Cumraig Britons and Roman soldiers Ninian was not a bishop of the Piks nor was his see among them He went to convert them after he was bishop and his church and see were among his country∣men the Cumraig Britons Not to mention his Life by Ailred Beda sufficiently explains this  praedicante eis verbum Nynia episcopo  and  cujus sedem episcopatus ad Candidam Casam eo quod ibi ecclesiam de lapide insolito  BRITONIBUS  more fecerit  But it is needless to insist on such a blunder The Piks converted by Ninian were those between the Forth and the Grampian hills as is clear not only from Beda but from Adomnan who represents Columba as keeping always on the north of these hills Ninian converted the  Vecturiones  Columba the  Dicaledones  the grand and natural divisions of the Piks in the time of Ammianus as fully ex∣plained before Hence Ninian a Cumraig Briton and Columba an Irishman are to be regarded as the apostles of the Piks or present Scots Let us now proceed to the chronology of a few facts recoverable in the ancient ecclesiastic history of North Britain  A D Ninian bishop of Candida Casa or Whithern in Valentia converts the Piks between the Forth and Grampian mountains  Beda  The life of Ninian by Ailred is a meagre piece con∣taining very little as to his Pikish mission and in civil history only mentions one Tudwald a Cum∣raig kinglet in the south of Valentia  Patrick converts the Dalreudini or old British Scots of Argyle then exiled into Ireland as he does the other Irish and prophesies that Fergus son of Erc shall be a king and father of kings  Jocelin  c  Columba converts the northern Piks and baptizes Brudi II son of Meilocon  Adomnan Beda Chron Pict  The life of Columba by Adomnan is very curious and interesting  Kentigern the StratelydeWelch saint of Glasgow flourishes His life by Jocelin is long and curious  The foundation of the church at Aber∣nethy is ascribed to Nethan II by the Register of St Andrew's  Ceolfrid writes his famous letter to Ne∣than III  Beda  Nethan desires architects to be sent to build a church  Id  perhaps that of Aber∣nethy  'Fergustus episcopus Scotioe Pictus' or 'Fergust the Pik an Irish bishop' was in the Roman general council A D  Concil  a  Binio  Tom V but forgeries swarm in these early councils  Constantin king of the Piks builds the church of Dunkeld  Reg St And Fordun Win∣ton  Ungust II son of Vergust founded Kil∣remont afterward called St Andrews as the same authors testify The clergy of St Andrew's after∣ward invented the legend of Regulus the appari∣tion of St Andrew to Ungust c But the fact is that the same ideas which led the Irish clergy to call the Piks Scots as Scythae also made them regard St Andrew as the apostle of the Piks be∣cause he was the apostle of the Scythae as ancient writers agree  Brudi VII is said to have founded the church of Lochleven  Reg St And  Kenneth III transported the reliques of Columba to a new church in Pikland  Chron Pict  Constantin III and Kellach bishop of St Andrews and all the people vowed solemnly to observe the laws of the churches and of the gos∣pels  Chron Pict  Kenneth IV seems to have founded the church of Brechen  Ib  The succession of abbots of Hyona and some other trifles concerning this period may be found in extracts from the Ulster Annals in the Appen∣dix  The monastery of Melrose was apparently ruined by the Danes about the year if not by Kenneth III about  Chron Pict  It remained in ruins till refounded by David l  I cannot find that there were any bishoprics before A D to the north of Clyde and Forth In present Scotland the bishopric of Galloway or Whithern is questionless the oldest next is that of Glasgow if we admit Kentigern to have been a bishop next is that of Abercorn or Lothian while that province was subject to Northumbria to The abbot of Hyona having such supreme power over the Pikish churches certainly would not allow of any bishop's see as the title was superior to his own and could not be controuled by him Abernethy and Dunkeld were but abbacies even in the eleventh century long after St Andrews was a bishopric Indeed all our writers ancient and modern concur that St Andrews was the most ancient bishopric north of Clyde and Forth  The origin of the bishopric of St And rews has been handled by many authors The learned and accurate Ruddiman puts Kellach as the first bishop and Kellach lived as we know from the  Chron Pict  in the sixth year of Constantin III or But Tighernac and the Annals of Ulster furnish us with a bishop of Pikland much ealier for at the year they say  Tuahal Mac Artgusa archbishop of Fortren and abbot of Dun Callen dor∣mivit  'Tuahal son of Artgus archbishop of Pik∣land and abbot of Dunkeld died' This would lead us to suspect that after Hyona was destroyed by the Danes  A D  Ann Ut  after which the titular abbots seem to have resided in Ireland chiefly till about A D when queen Margaret rebuilt the church  Order Vital  Some of the present edifice seems of that period In Aulaf king of Dublin died in pilgrimage at Hyona  Ann Prior Ins SS  Ware's MSS  or after its power over the Pikish  churches ceased the abbot of Dunkeld was for a time regarded as supreme of the Pikish church Certain it is that St Andrew's had no title to be regarded as supreme church in Pikland till erec∣ted into a bishopric And there is reason to be∣lieve that this happened in the reign of Achy and Grig For Fordun and Winton say that Kellach the first bishop lived in the time of Grig or their Gregory and this agrees with the  Chron Pict  which mentions him as yet living un∣der Constantin III or fifteen years after the expulsion of Achy and Grig A singular passage of the  Reg St And  in the reign of Grig also strengthens this  Et hic primus dedit libertatem ec∣clesiae Scoticanae quae sub servitute erat usque ad illud tempus ex constitutione et more Pictorum  'He first gave freedom to the Scotish church which till that time was in servitude by the constitution and custom of the Piks' This surely refers to the subjection of the Pikish churches to Hyona from which they were delivered by erecting St An∣drews into a bishopric Our clergy in gratitude gave much fabulous praise to Grig as was their custom in such cases and say that he conquered Ireland and most of England I cannot help sus∣pecting that this subjection of the Pikish churches to Hyona contributed to render the name of Piks odious to our clergy and to recommend that of Scots that they might transfer the old ecclesiastic power of the Scots in Pikland to themselves as also Scots For the seminary of Hyona being now destroyed and Ireland subject to the Scandi∣navians enemies of Pikland such native clergy as now arose affected the name of Scots so revered by long custom and so superior in ecclesiastic matters and at same time naturally hated their  old spiritual masters the Irish Our native clergy being however distant from the then chief seats of learning France and Germany were long so deficient that our kings were glad to have clergy from England as the examples of Turgot and of Eadmer both bishops of St Andrews may witness And to this local situation was it owing that while Ireland and England from proximity to France and afterward Scandinavia from proxi∣mity to Germany produced many writers not one arose in Pikland till the thirteenth century when Michael Scot and others flourished When this is considered it is no wonder that our history is be∣hind that of every country in Europe  The other bishops of St Andrews the only bishopric in that tract after called Scotland proper as before Albany and Pikland and hence called simply  episcopi  in our old fragments were after Kellach  Fothad  who was expelled by king Indulf  Fordun  and died in the time of Odo  Chron Pict  The third was  Maelbriget  called Malisius by Fordun who died in Culen's time  Chron Pict  The fourth was  Kellach  II son of Ferdulaig who suc∣ceeded Maelbriget  ib  and died about The fifth  Malis  the sixth  Malmer  from to The seventh  Alwin  to The eighth Malduin to Except the journey of Macbeth to Rome there is no reason to be∣lieve that the Pikish churches paid any homage to the Roman Hyona was their Rome till the end of the ninth century and king Grig not the Pope made St Andrews a bishopric as above shewn from our old fragments Even the pil∣grimage of Macbeth was merely to Rome as a holy city as others went pilgrims to Jerusalem Scotland was too poor for papal rapacity or usur∣pation In the first legate John of Crema appeared in Scotland and before that time there is not a trace of any papal power in Scotland  This chapter shall be closed with a few hints concerning the Culdees It is well known that a violent dispute was long carried on by the pres∣byterian and episcopal writers concerning this noted class of men Selden Sir James Dalrymple and other presbyterian writers would have the Culdees to be a sort of presbyters strangers to the Roman church and to episcopacy Lloyd Stil∣ling fleet and Keith will have them to have been episcopal The best account of them yet given is doubtless that presixt to Keith's Catalogue of Scotish bishops and from thence it is clear from ancient charters that the Culdees far from being enemies to episcopacy were the very men who chose the bishops Doubtless he who expects to find in Scotland matters not to be found in any neighbouring country only shews his own credu∣lity and that from the fourth century every Christian country had its bishops is too well known to be insisted on But that these bishops differed very much from the warlike bishops of the ninth and following centuries and from the opulent and idle bishops of later times is as clear  When St Martin first brought monks into Eu∣rope about the year their rigid life acquired them high esteem In a short time the bishops were chiefly chosen from their order and after∣ward usurping the right of the people they be∣gan to chuse the bishops from among themselves Hence in the middle ages almost every mona∣stery had its bishop almost every bishopric its monastery Nay the abbot or chief of the mona∣stery was sometimes esteemed superior in dignity to the bishop that is in every thing not immedi∣ately belonging to the episcopal function Of this the monastery of Hyona the seminary of Christi∣anity in North Britain affords a noted instance  Regente monasterium abbate quem ipsi episcopi cum cousilio fratrum elegerint omnes presbyteri diaconi canto∣res lectores ceterique gradus ecclesiastici monachicam per omnia cum ipso episcopo regulam servant Beda Vita Cuthb de Hyona  Hence the abbot of Hyona was in effect primate of Scotland till the ninth century When Hyona had been ravaged by the Danes Dunkeld was the primatial see till the reign of Grig and Achy A D from which time St Andrews held that supremacy But the high rank of the abbots of Dunkeld one of whom was the father of a royal race of Scotland and another Ethelred the son of Malcom III sufficiently marks the estima∣tion in which that dignity was long held In Abernethy Dunkeld c it is reasonable to infer that there were bishops as well as at Hyona but being subject to the abbots they attracted no at∣tention  The Culdees were surely only Irish clergy At first they seem to have been regular monks who followed the rule of St Columba and generally their societies consisted of twelve and a chief  Keith pref  in imitation either of Christ and the apostles or of Columba and the twelve monks who came with him from Ireland  Adomnan ad fin  In the gradual corruption of the monastic order they married and left their Culdeeships to their children  Keith Sir J Dalrymple c  and after the ha∣vock introduced by the Danes usurped the rank of secular clergy In short they were merely cor∣rupted monks such as abounded in all the coun∣tries of Europe till the eleventh century when the popes were forced to institute canons regular whom the princes gradually introduced into the chief monasteries instead of the old depraved monks  Mosheim Inst Hist Eccl The common canons began in the eighth century and were a middle order between monks and secular priests  Ib  Henry I brought these canons into England and soon after we find the Scotish sove∣reigns turning out the Culdees to make way for  these canons The various modern sort of mona∣stic names and orders it is well known did not begin till the twelfth century  The Culdees thus united in themselves the dis∣tinctions of monks and of secular clergy being apparently from Columba's time to the eleventh century the only monks and clergy in Scotland and all Irish as formerly shewn At St Andrew's the Culdees elected the bishops till and existed there till  Keith  at Dunkeld Dumblane and Brechin they elected the bishops yet later than at St Andrew's At the two last they consti∣tuted with their prior the dean and chapter till about A D  Keith Dalrymple  It is well known what struggles it cost the popes to reform the monks and to prevent them and the clergy from marry∣ing even in the southern countries of Europe and we are not to wonder that in so remote a cor∣ner as Scotland the supposed abuses remained long incorrigible Till the decree of Gregory VII all the clergy might marry or have concu∣bines  Mosheim  and it was not till a century after that their opposition was effectually overcome even in England  Gul Malmsb Hoveden c    CHAPTER II  Literary History  THIS part of my subject is so extremely con∣tracted that very little can be said upon it It is a melancholy truth that the Piks did not pro∣duce one writer till the thirteenth century and there is not even a Pikish saint or churchman on record The little learning of North Britain during this period was confined to the Stratclyde Welch and to the Irish clergy In this chapter therefore can only be given some hints concern∣ing learning among  The Stratclyde Welch  The Irish clergy in Pikland as also  Rea∣sons why learning was unknown among the Piks or later Scots even till the thirteenth century  THE STRATCLYDE WELCH  Ninian  may be regarded as belonging to them but alas from the want of literature which so long pre∣vailed among the Southern Piks his converts it is too clear that he was a pious man but a stranger to letters else he would never have neglected so essential a part of his mission  Patrick  was born at Nemthur near Alclud or Dunbarton now thought to be Old Kirkpatrick From his own name  Patricius  and that of his fa∣ther  Calphurnius  he appears to have been of Ro∣man extract and he was indeed born about the year when the Romans possessed Valentia In he went to Ireland and after converting that whole iland died about He was cer∣tainly a man of extraordinary talents for the  time and country His first and greatest care was to teach the Irish the use of letters as the prime mean of making their conversion permanent Would that he had also been the apostle of the Piks or that Ninian and Columba had shewn such care The supreme veneration in which the Irish always held and still hold Patrick is most deserved and just while it is no wonder that Ninian and Columba were forgotten among us Two genuine epistles of Patrick are pre∣served and have been published by Ware  Gildas  Albanius or the saint was son of a king of Alclyde and born as Usher collects about He must be carefully distinguished from that Gildas who wrote the book  De excidio Britonum  and who lived a century after The epithet  Albanius  marks the present as a native of Albany or Scotland Caradoc of Llancarvon the Welch historian wrote the life of St Gildas who was only remarkable for superior piety and was no writer  The only other native of Stratclyde here to be mentioned is  Merlinus Caledonius  otherwise called Merlin the Wild This extraordinary or per∣haps fabulous personage lived at Alclyde in the time of king Roderch and was thus cotemporary with Kentigern A D The other and more famous Merlin the Magician lived as appears from Nennius in the time of Vortigern or more than a century before him of Caledonia A curi∣ous life of Merlin the Wild written in Latin verse by Geofrey of Monmouth is extant and extracts may be found below  Dux Venedatorum Feridurus bella gerebat  Contra Guennoloum Scotiae qui regna regebat  Vencrat ad bellum

a long account of the virtues of fountains and natures of different birds mentions 'urbs Caerloyctoyc' and concludes in five lines that the author is 'Gaufridus de Monumeta'  scripsit qui libellum

melancholy visionary who by living in the woods and other singularities acquired the reputation of a prophet Fordun III has a long tale concerning Kentigern and Merlin the Wild  I know not if any fragments of Welch poetry written in Stratclyde or in Cumbria remain But indeed there is great room to question the anti∣quity of those ascribed to Taliessin and others A man accustomed to exact ideas in antiquarian matters will hardly suppose that pieces unknown to Nennius Geofrey Giraldus Caradoc should be developed in the eighteenth century I have known a man of learning imagine that a song written but ten years ago was four hundred years old Antiquity is a special science and tho perhaps the most difficult of any yet every one pretends to judge of it  II THE IRISH CLERGY IN PIKLAND  Columba  the apostle of the Northern Piks is said to have written one or two pieces extant But he wanted the talents of Patrick and did not teach his con∣verts the use of letters  Cuminius  abbot of Hyona wrote a life of Columba published by Mabillon and others  Adomnan  abbot of Hyona composed a long life of Columba in three books published by Canisius from an imperfect copy for that in the king's library is larger He also wrote an ac∣count of the Holy Places in Judaea abridged by Beda but published whole by Mabillon  Besides these i cannot find any remain written in present Scotland during the period preceding except the  Chronicon Pictorum  And another short chronicle or two may have been begun or at any rate the names of the kings preserved in the religious books and records whence they were afterward digested into short chronicles But let us now examine the causes of this deplorable de∣fect of literature among the Piks  III REASONS WHY LEARNING WAS UNKNOWN IN PIKLAND TILL THE XIIITH CENTURY  The want of learning and of talents in the apostles of the Piks may be regarded as one great cause of this deplorable defect Ninian and Columba were of confined minds and of bigotted piety strangers to secular learning and to those enlarged ideas which prompted Ulphilas Patrick and in later times the apostles of Scandinavia to impart the use of letters as the first foundation among their converts These apostles of the Piks as appears from their lives were men lost in gloomy bigotry Patrick understood the Irish language himself while Columba was forced to use an interpreter among the Piks as Adomnan tells whereas he ought to have studied their lan∣guage in the very first place Bollandus has ob∣served that in the Welch and Irish lives of saints the miracles and visions are so numerous and absurd and the whole tenor so unlike those of other coun∣tries that he did not know what to think of them But this was the natural fruit of that strange cre∣dulity and weakness of mind peculiar to the  Celts The lives of Ninian and of Columba swarm with such puerile miracles as are really impious nay blasphemous while every thing that is rational wise and truly virtuous is forgotten Such Celtic apostles were not calculated to en∣lighten and civilize a nation and illiterate themselves could never impart literature to others  To a late period the only common clergy in Pikland were Irish as is clear from there be∣ing no Pikish saints or churchmen to be found in history or in sanctology from Hyona being the seminary of the Pikish church and from such fragments of our history as remain which bear Irish epithets names c and which were certainly written by clergy the only literati of the time The offices of the church were per∣formed in Latin nay the homilies preached in that language as appears from those of Beda and others and as all conversant in ecclesiastic history know There was of course no necessity for the clergy to learn the Pikish language Even in England as appears from Beda most of the clergy were Irish and came from Ireland and Hyona to English sees at once having no necessity to know the common language Latin alone being necessary The divine service and preachings tho in Latin it was an office of piety to attend but scarce one in an audience understood a word so that they could not in∣struct the people And the Irish clergy for their own interest retained the Pikish church to themselves and never excited Pikish youth to qualify themselves for the church which they re∣garded as their own peculiar portion  As these Celtic clergy were strangers to the liberal sentiments of true wisdom so they had all that cunning which is the wisdom of folly and all that selfishness which attends a narrow mind This is evident from the conduct of Columba  and his successors The institution of Hyona an Irish seminary as supreme church of Pikland was and is without example in ecclesiastic his∣tory The metropolitan church ought to have been established in the heart of Pikland and as in other countries all means should have been used to furnish a native clergy Instead of which all the churches were in utter subjection to Hyona a foreign seminary and their clergy furnished and commissioned from thence Thus the interest of religion was sacrificed to the meanest avarice and ambition and Hyona may be regarded as the Rome of Pikland supporting its own power and interest by keeping the sub∣jects of its church in ignorance When the church of St Andrew's was made metropolitan by kings Achy and Grig at the end of the ninth century it was long before a native clergy could be formed and the Irish clergy from su∣perior opportunities and learning and from an∣cient veneration and custom still held the com∣mon offices of the church even down to the twelfth or thirteenth century Interest national spirit and ecclesiastic party long maintained them and they were only supplanted by degrees as the natives from advanced society and visiting foreign universities began to acquire learning and to shake off those bonds of ignorance in which remote situation and the selfishness of the Irish clergy so long held them Hyona was indeed no longer the seminary but as the Irish clergy had been settled in the churches of Pik∣land and married among themselves like the tribe of Levi the only change was that there were many Irish seminaries instead of one  The local situation of Pikland was inimical to the learning of its natives Of the other ex∣treme countries of Europe Scandinavia was only separated by a narrow sea from Germany a country full of schools learning and authors  before Scandinavia was converted England and Ireland were in the same situation with respect to France another learned country Whereas Pik∣land was the most remote corner in Europe and less known of course than any country in it not being mentioned by any writers on the con∣tinent during the middle ages The learning of Ireland such as it was the Irish clergy from special motives above explained did not impart to the Piks That of England was intercepted by mutual enmity and by the Danes who seizing the North of England debarred all in∣tercourse  Want of commerce was another cause for a nation cannot be learned without books Af∣ter the Saracens seized Egypt in the seventh century manuscripts became extremely scarce as no papyrus could be had Paper made of silk and of cotton was not invented till the eleventh century our common paper not till the four∣teenth Parchment had never been common as it was always dear and only used on important occasions The books that swarmed in Greek and Roman times almost as much as now were written on papyrus a grand article of Egyptian commerce When this failed books became extremely scarce and continued so till paper was invented But while for want of books even the learning of Greece Italy Germany France was at a low ebb it was no wonder that Pik∣land had none at all England Ireland Scandi∣navia were all frequented by foreign merchants while the remote situation of Pikland and its want of materials for commerce rendered it un∣visited and almost unknown  The warlike spirit of the Piks and conti∣nual occasions for its exertion were inimical to learning In Ireland at the time clerical learning flourished there domestic wars abounded but the parties reverenced the clergy who enjoyed  quiet among these commotions Very different was the case in the ninth century when foreign enemies ravaging Ireland banished all its learning at once But Pikland not being a detached country like Ireland but acting on perpetual offence or defence against a foreign foe was al∣most in constant war or preparation a state to∣tally inimical to learning  The natural poverty of the country pre∣cluded learning as it did other advantages For learning belongs to ease and in a poor country and early society conjoined constant labour must be employed to procure subsistence Even the church was poor and had not above three grand establishments Abernethy Dunkeld and St An∣drew's whereas in Ireland the establishments from the earliest period were very numerous as the fertility of the country invited Among so few churchmen it is no wonder that learning was scarce as the chance was so much smaller than in other countries Hence even among the Irish clergy of Pikland very few had any talents or learning The whole inhabitants of Pikland did not exceed a million for they do not exceed that number now and the population is surely en∣creased The chance of one man of learning arising in that number at a time when Germany France England produced but one or two was next to nothing and it is no wonder that it never took place but on the contrary a miracle must have happened if it had  The northern Goths of Scandinavia of whom the Piks were a branch were long remark∣able for contempt of letters and regarded them as one of the effeminate pursuits of ease beneath the notice of warriors This contempt had a greater effect than indocility could have had and was radically inimical to learning for what is despised can never be an object of pursuit The plain sense of these people was indeed remarkably  strong and acute and it is no wonder that the absurd superstition and foolish reading of the clergy during the darker ages met utter scorn from their severe wisdom Ragnar Lodbrog's ex∣pression of a  mass of weapons  shews the greatest contempt of the then Christian superstition and its professors And as they despised the literati of the time so they scorned letters and regarded arms as the sole object of pursuit  At the time the Scandinavians began their ravages in Europe the Irish clergy of Hyona were the sole churchmen in Pikland and keeped the people in ignorance as above explained But those ravages so inimical to French and English literature totally extinguished the Irish so that even the sole fountain whence clerical learning could have flowed into Pikland was dried up And Pikland itself was repeatedly ravaged by the Scandinavians in the ninth century which must have checked learning if any was then be∣ginning to bud The Irish clergy after this produced no Cuminius or Adomnan Nor till the thirteenth century was any thing written by these only literati we had save a few lists of our kings untinctured with any reading except that of Nennius and Isidorus The ravages of the Scandinavians may therefore be regarded as a grand cause that delayed the commencement of literature in Pikland to a late period as other causes abovementioned prevented its taking place before those ravages  Almost any of these causes may sufficiently ac∣count for the very late appearance of learning among the Piks or present Scots but when all are jointly considered it is believed they will be found fully satisfactory  SUPPLEMENT  SUPPLEMENT The Angles and the Norwegians  SECTION I  The Angles  TO render this work more complete it is necessary to consider the possessions of the Angles and those of the Norwegians in present Scotland The nations who in the fifth and sixth centuries settled in present England were three the Jutes who fixed in Kent the Saxons who held the rest of the south and the Angles who possessed the country north of the Humber and some other tracts on the north of the Saxons The Jutes arrived in the first Saxons in the first Angles in The Jutes were originally in the north of present Jutland to which they af∣terward gave a general name The Angles were in the south of present Jutland The Saxons ex∣tended from the south of Jutland to the Rhine The Jutes and Angles were Scandinavian Goths and of those who expelled the Cimbri about years before Christ The Saxons were German Goths  The Celts of Britain and Ireland called all these three nations by the general name of Saxons and the Jutes and Angli are termed Saxons by Gildas Nennius Tighernach and other Welch and Irish writers Beda on the contrary who was an Angle of Northumbria gives them the general name of Angli which has since prevailed But by a strict enquirer the three nations must be considered apart and not in the confusion of a general name Hence it will occur that the Angles who held the north of present England and especially first set∣tled in Northumbria the oldest Anglic kingdom are the only nation of the three who could hold possessions in present Scotland  But a fable must here be discussed Nennius who wrote in calls the people who in came to Kent under Hengist and Horsa by the general name of Saxons tho from Beda's express testimony they were Jutes Among others of the most childish and unchronologic fables Nennius tells cap that after the marriage of Vortiger and Rowena or about Hengist prevailed on Vortiger to permit Ohta his son and Ebissa son of Horsa to settle in the north near the walls That they came with forty ships navigated a∣round the Piks wasted the Orkneys  et occupa∣verunt plurimas regiones trans mare Fresicum i e quod inter nos Scotosque est usque ad confinia Picto∣rum  'and occupied many countries beyond the Fresic sea or that between us and the Scots even to the confines of the Piks'  This tale of Nennius fell into the hands of William of Malmsbury  It also occurs in Geofrey of Monmouth  a respectable historian but as he wrote about he is yet a worse authority than Nennius for so remote an event Malmsbury says Lib I c 'Hengist abusing the king's imprudence persuaded him to call his brother and son brave men from Germany  that as he defended the country on the east so they might bridle the Scots on the north So the king conniving they after sailing around Britain went to the Orkneys and involving these nations in the same calamity with the Piks and Scots they then and after settled in the northern part of the iland now called Northumbria Yet none there used the royal badge or name till Ida from whom the lineage of Northumbrian kings grew But of this below' Accordingly c he proceeds 'We have above said in few words and now repeat that Hengist having confirmed his kingdom in Kent sent his brother Otha and son Ebusa men of bold and tried experience to oc∣cupy the northern parts of Britain They pro∣ceeding as commanded had a fortune agreeable to their endeavours For fighting often with the provincials and defeating those who resisted they allured the rest by receiving their fidelity in quiet Tho they thus gained some power by their own arts and the favour of their subjects yet they as∣sumed not the style of kings nor did their first successors For a hundred years all but one the Northumbrian leaders content with common dress lived private under the dominion of the kings of Kent But in the year and after the death of Hengist the dukedom was changed to a king∣dom and Ida reigned there first but whether he seized the kingdom or was elected is unknown'  Selden in his Titles of Honour Lib II c tells us that the dignity of Ealdorman or Earl was both feudal and hereditary from the very first arrival of the Saxons and quotes the above last passage of Malmsbury to confirm it Selden knew more of Syriac and Arabic than of the history of his country or antiquities of the middle ages and tho learned in Syrian mythology was in the history of his country and middle antiquities a mere dabler Indeed had he paid due attention to the later he could have found no time to at∣tend  to eastern learning The account of Malms∣bury which he founds on is a mere fable grafted on a fable of Nennius and confutes itself The sailing around Britain the invasion of the Ork∣neys in order to obtain a settlement in Northum∣bria the title of dukes and dukedom the feudal subjection of Northumbria a country four times the size of the kingdom of Kent the hereditary succession of dukes a matter unknown then ex∣cept of kings the ignorance concerning Ida who as we know from Beda and the Saxon Chronicle was the very first leader of the Angles to Britain all these circumstances brand this ac∣count as a gross and absurd fiction And as Beda the Saxon Chronicle Ethelwerd Florence of Worcester or all the writers preceding Malms∣bury except Nennius only know nothing of this colony it is clear that Malmsbury's testimony on so remote an event amounts to nothing But Nennius deserves examination  The work of Nennius and Samuel is deservedly considered as the weakest that ever bore the name of history Its fables are so childish and gro∣tesque as to disgrace the human mind Yet weak as it is it has not reached us in its original state but is full of corruptions and interpolations No man therefore of the smallest reflection would found an historic fact on the  sole  testimony of such a work But Nennius is palpably the sole autho∣rity of William of Malmsbury It is remarkable that at the end of Nennius we find genealogies of Northumbrian kings confessedly not by Nennius but by some Northumbrian writer And it seems probable that this account of Ohta and Ebisa is interpolated by the same Northumbrian hand in order to raise the antiquity of that settlement to a par with the earliest of the others But allowing the passage to be of Nennius or Samuel their work is so grossly fabulous that its testimony can∣not be weighed against Gildas and Beda who are  quite silent as to this memorable event nor even against later but authentic writers the Saxon Chronicler Ethelwerd Florence of Worcester The passage of Nennius is unintelligible for the  Mare Fresicum  Except Jocelin in his life of Kentigern who mistaking Nennius implies it the frith of Forth  is not mentioned by any other writer but is quite unknown It cannot be the frith of Forth because it is clear from Beda that the Jutes or Saxons possessed no tract  beyond  that aestuary nor could Nennius have added 'even to the confines of the Piks' for they held all down to the wall of Severus after as above shewn from Beda and others It cannot be Solway frith for it was not between the Welch and Scots as Nennius says nor did Beda know of any Jutes or Saxons in Galloway The  Scoti  of Nennius are infallibly the Irish and the  MareFresicum  must be that between England and Ireland anciently called  Vergivium  The Welch have no V but always use F for it and i doubt not but some transcriber has put  Fresicum  for  Fergicum  This sea not only passes between Ireland and Wales  inter nos Scotosque  but forms a vast bay between Wales and the north of England so that a settle∣ment on the south of the wall of Gallio would be  trans mare Fresicum  respecting Wales This is clearly the meaning of Nennius as he also says that the regions demanded by Hengist for his son and nephew were  juxta murum qui vocatur Gual  But it is needless to explain the meaning of a fable for such this whole story certainly is for the following reasons  Gildas the most ancient British writer knew nothing of this settlement  Beda not only knew nothing of it but is a decisive witness against it for tho living in Nor∣thumbria and particular as to its history he men∣tions no Jutes there nor Saxons but on the con∣trary tells us I that the people of Northum∣bria  were Angles and those of Kent Jutes  Nennius and Samuel were posterior to these two  Their work is full of monstrous fables  It is corrupt and interpolated beyond example  Later authentic writers the Saxon Chronicle Ethelwerd Florence of Worcester know nothing of this settlement and a posterior author Malms∣bury only copies and adds to Nennius  This is the only settlement which left not a trace be∣hind it insomuch that Mr Gibbon says that it must have been soon cut off  Decline and Fall of the Rom Emp vol V p vo  but in fact it never existed  The account of Malmsbury is absurd and selfcontradictory as above shewn nay im∣possible as it is incongruous with the manners of the times and Selden confesses he could find no other example of feudal and hereditary leaders and as it contradicts common sense to suppose that Northumbria a country four times as large as the Kentish kingdom should be a mere earl∣dom dependent of it  The Saxon Chronicle tells us in express terms that Ida arrived in Bri∣tain with his people the Angles in ships only the year he became king so that he had no connection with those imaginary Dukes as Malmsbury supposes  This fable overturned little remains for this section The Angles were of Scandinavian ex∣tract but had seized on the south of present Jutland whence in the first colony of them came to Britain under Ida a great and va∣liant leader The Saxon Chronicle says they came in XL ships John of Wallingford in LX This colony could not exceed or and it conquered and settled among the Piks who as formerly shewn held now all the tract down to the Humber Ida seized on the north part of Northumbria and founded the kingdom of Bernicia reaching in his reign or soon after  from Teise to Forth The kingdom of Deira or present Yorkshire was founded by Ella also an Anglic prince in but only lasted forty years when Adelfrid king of Bernicia conquered it and erected all Northumbria into one king∣dom being the most important and famous of the heptarchy Beda and the other literati of the heptarchy were all of Northumbria and yet its history is obscure  In Egfrid king of Northumbria ravag∣ing Pikland was defeated and slain by king Brudi son of Bili upon which the Piks reco∣vered dominion of the south east of present Scot∣land down to the Tweed Trumwin Anglic bishop of the Piks of Lothian was forced to leave Abercorn and fly After this as Beda says the Northumbrian power gradually declined till his time nay after till the extinction of the Anglic kingdom about Till this last event however the Angles retained all the country south of Tweed from its mouth to its fountain and so in a line to the Irish sea Melros and Whithern the south of Galloway and perhaps Cuningham and Kyle remained theirs till the fall of the Northumbrian kingdom About Kenneth king of the Piks burned Melrose as an usurpa∣tion on his states and about the same time the Piks seized on the Anglic possessions in Gal∣loway Baldulf  Malmsb Gest Pont fol v  was the last Anglic bishop of Whithern which had no more till Melrose remained in ruins till when re∣founded by David I The Chronicle of Melros was written in that and next century the part after Beda being a mere extract from Turgot Florence of Worcester the Saxon Chronicle and other English writers there being no Scotish his∣torians to copy after and the monks being Eng∣lish Cistertians from Reval and strangers to Scotish affairs  Thus in the beginning of the ninth century the Angles lost all ground in present Scotland The population was Pikish and the Piks only recovered the dominion not the possession as fully shewn before The Angles who ruled in Northumbria being the men at arms were mostly cut off by the Danes while the common inha∣bitants remained and there is room to question if real  Angli  were left in England in the tenth century It is remarkable that English writers of the twelfth century mention the  Angli  as barbarous  Angli et Scotti et Picti et caeteri barbari  Ricard Ha∣gustald Gesta Steph  Scriptores x  col    and this singularity seems to have sprung from the barbarity of the Piks of Northum∣bria compared to their southern brethren who had been polished by the Romans and communi∣cated their arts to the Saxon conquerors  SECTION II  The Norwegians History of the Iles  A Great part of the Pikish dominions was seized by the Norwegians before the year a circumstance which entitles them to a place in this work These Norwegian acquisi∣tions consisting of the Orkneys and part of the north of Pikland and the Hebudes with part of the west this section falls of course into two arti∣cles But as our historians with their usual ig∣norance follow the dreams of Fordun and sup∣pose both the Orkneys and Hebudes to have been only yielded to Magnus king of Norway by Do∣nald Ban in it becomes necessary to establish the fundamental facts in the first place  Concerning the cession of the Orkneys in even our own writers hesitate and Buchanan restricts that cession to the  insuloe occidentales  'western iles' or Hebudes Simeon of Durham says that in Magnus seized the Orkneys But this acquisition of Magnus is quite misun∣derstood by our writers He did not make any conquest from the Scots but merely forced to his homage the Norwegian lords who more than two centuries before had seized on the Ork∣neys and Hebudes and assumed independency This essential fact is so deeply rooted in Scandi∣navian history that the testimony of so late a writer as Fordun can never shake it Icelandic writers from the eleventh century downward afford such simple and unbiassed evidence that the Norwegians possessed the Orkneys and He∣budes  from the time of Harold Harfagre that to reject their credit would be to violate every law of history  As to the  Orkneys  Torfaeus a writer of the most laudable industry affords full illustration in the thin folio volume he has published on their history It is evident however that he has ante∣dated the reign of Harold Harfagre about thirty years For by his account Harold conquered the provincial kings of Norway and assumed the sole government in yet reigned till that is years besides his provincial reign Tor∣faeus was a very bad chronologer and it is evident that Harold must have become sole king of Nor∣way about or after the year And by the Orkneyinga Saga and other accounts it was Harold Harfagre that seized on the Orkneys and on the Hebudes whereas Torfaeus dates this event in But if it happend during the reign of Harold Harfagre it could not take place till about The Scandinavian chronology preceeding the year when the real history of Denmark Norway and Sweden begins is in∣deed very fallacious and the reigns of kings ridi∣culously extended  But the Icelandic accounts bear that before Harold subdued the Orkneys and Hebudes they had become receptables of Norwegian pirates who had often ravaged his territories and that he made expeditions against them in revenge And from more certain records of British Irish and French history it is well known that the Normans or Norwegians began in the end of the eighth century to ravage Ireland In they burned the church at Hyona and slew many of the monks In they invaded Pik∣land and during that century often ravaged it Particularly the reign of Constantin II to was most calamitous by their invasions and almost total conquest of the country and it is  during this reign that i incline to fix the settle∣ment of the Norwegians in the Orkneys and He∣budes But even from the beginning of that century these iles were more in the Norwegian than in the Pikish possession being the first re∣ceptacles of those pirates who from them chiefly carried on their ravages into Ireland and Pikland Even in the Annals of Ulster mention Nor∣wegians of Ireland and of  Albain  or Pikland so that they must have held a part of Pikland by this time And from this period the Hebudes are called  InchGall  or Iles of Foreigners by Irish writers Nor is there a single hint in our frag∣ments that the Orkneys or the Hebudes were at all subject to the kings of the united Piks and Dalriads who had no fleet to attack the Scandi∣navians and could of course neither defend those ilands nor resume them  Such being the case we may safely say that from at least the Orkneys and Hebudes were held by Norwegian pirates till about when Harold Harfagre subdued them and ap∣pointed Earls and a regular government and habitation followed As after the Scandi∣navian history becomes clear and authentic the names and succession and many actions of the earls of Orkney are perfectly preserved And that the Hebudes also were possest by the Norwe∣gians by that time if not before is also authen∣ticated from the most ancient records of their history while we have not one hint to shew that they belonged to Pikland It is needless there∣fore to say that that our writers betray gross igno∣rance when they imagine the Orkneys and He∣budes to have belonged to Scotland till They have only the testimony of Fordun a writer of the end of the fourteenth century while against them are twenty or thirty writers preceding that time The  Chronicon Manniae  is also clear against them seeing it begins with Godred king of Mann  and the Hebudes in The records of Mann are said to be still preserved among the episcopal archives at Drontheim in Norway Mr Sache∣verel informs us that in Guttred was king of Maun and the Hebudes and after him Reginald Olave Olan Fingal then Godred But the expeditions of Harold Harfagre against the Norwegian pirates of Shetland the Orkneys and Hebudes and his establishment of regular go∣vernment in the two later are confirmed by the whole of Scandinavian history Among a cloud of other authorities are Thiodolf the Scald or Poet of Harold Harfagre whose verses are preserved by Snorro Snorro who gives a particular ac∣count of these expeditions the Landnama book of Iceland which contains the names and fami∣lies of many Norwegians who went from the Hebudes to settle in Iceland in the tenth century the  Codex Flateyensis  one of the most ancient and authentic records of Scandinavian history the Orkneying a Saga Niaga Saga and the other Icelandic monuments Aimoinus and Robertus de Monte two ancient foreign writers quoted by Torfaeus avouch that the Orkneys and north of Scotland and the Hebudes were subjected to Norway  So Torfaeus asserts p but i cannot find the passages and believe them imaginary  before the time of Harold Harfagre  Such being the case it is believed no doubt can remain on this radical fact of the early sub∣jection of the Orkneys and Hebudes to the Nor∣wegians and a few hints shall now be given on the history of these iles The reader has already seen that the idea he is to form of the Orkneys during this period is that of a Norwegian Earl∣dom and of the Hebudes that of a Norwegian Kingdom    The Orkneys  The Piks in their progress from Scandina∣via seem to have entirely neglected the Orkneys as Solinus who wrote about the year says they were desert in his time The very name is according to Torfaeus derived from  Ork  a de∣sert But after the Pikish tribes were united into one monarchy and extensive power about the year the Orkneys were peopled by them This appears from an authentic record of Tho∣mas bishop of the Orkneys dated  Published in Wallace's Orkneys edit and from that book in the Orkneyinga Saga  in which we are told that when the Norwegians conquered the Orkneys they found them posses∣sed  duabus nationibus scilicet Peti et Pape  'by two nations the Pets and Papas' The first of these nations was palpably the Piks called Pets by the Scandinavians as Saxo's  Petia  or Pik∣land and the name  Petland fiord  for Pikland frith in Icelandic writings may witness The Papas by the usual confusion of long tradition here called a nation were clearly the Irish papas or priests long the sole clergy in the Pikish do∣mains and who speaking a different language from the Piks were by the Norwegian settlers regarded not as a distinct profession only but as remains of a different nation Thus Arius Frodi  De Islandia p edit Havniae See also Theodoricus monachus de reb Norv p  who wrote about tells us that the Norwe∣gians who colonized Iceland found there Irish  papas  who were driven out but left their Irish books  baecr Irscar  behind them  Papey  one of the Orkneys in all likelihood derives its name from being a chief residence of the Papas  Wallace also tells that by Orcadian tradition the  Pechts  were the first inhabitants and many circular buildings in the Orkneys are called Pechts Houses Those Piks who possessed the Orkneys from remote and distinct situation used to set up kinglets of their own and affect independency About as appears from Adomnan's life of Columba there was a  regulus Orcadum  or king∣let of the Orkneys at the residence of Brudi II the Pikish king In the Orkneys having again rebelled were wasted by Brudi IV as we learn from Tighernach and the Annals of Ulster  In the ninth century they were seized by Nor∣wegian pirates as above explained About Harold Harfagre king of Norway irritated by the incursions of those pirates on his kingdom proceeded against them and subduing them ap∣pointed earls and regular government in the Orkneys Harold offered Rognwald the earldom but that chief was in such favour with the king and so extremely opulent in great possessions in Norway that he entreated Harold to give the investiture to Sigurd his brother which was done This Sigurd the first earl is called Eystein∣son or the Elder to distinguish him from the se∣cond Sigurd surnamed the Gross who fell at Clontarf The Orcadian history after this may be found in Torfaeus and it is sufficiently clear and exact if we except the fable of a  Kalius  king of Scotland at the time Duncan reigned there But this one fable grounded on old bal∣lads only does not injure the rest for if we reject ancient history because one or two fables have crept in what history could stand A list of the earls of Orkney may be found in our Appendix It shall only be observed here that the Norwegi∣ans in the Orkneys were converted to Christianity about That the Norwegian earls continued till about when they failed in the person of  Magnus  Sutherland was taken from the earls of Orkney by Alex∣ander king of Scotland  Charta    supra citat  surely Alex l for in the reign of William there were Scotish earls of Sutherland  and the Orkneys and Caithness fell to Malis earl of Strathern the next heir Malis had two daughters one married to Weland de Ard who had Caithness and their son Alexander de Ard sold that county to Robert II king of Scotland The other was married to William Sinclair lord Sinclair in whose family the Ork∣neys long remained Malcom II gave Thorfin investiture of the Orkneys But in Magnus Barefoot king of Norway accord∣ing to Simeon of Durham conquered the Ork∣neys And Icelandic accounts bear that he de∣posed the earls Paul and Erland and gave the Orkneys to his own son Sigurd But in Magnus being slain in Ireland Sigurd went to Norway to assume the kingdom and Magnus son of Erland the late Earl came from Scotland and became Earl After which there is no hint that the Earls were subject to Norway but they were independent In Magnus earl of Ork∣ney signs the famous letter to the Pope along with the other Scotish peers  This earldom besides the Orkneys comprized a great part of the north of Scotland The Norwegian accounts exaggerate in their own fa∣vour as usual in all countries Sigurd the first earl is said to have subdued Caithness Sutherland Ross and Moray It seems certain however that the  Moravienses  were the furthest people on the northeast who acknowleged the Scotish king and even they were often in arms against him Thus the Norwegians held all down to Murray Frith on the east On the west they seem to have held all present Rossshire Caithness and Sutherland belonged to the earl∣dom of Orkney as all grant and Sutherland  took its name from its southern situation in re∣spect to Caithness and the Orkneys As to Ross it can only be said that the Icelandic accounts bear that it belonged to that earldom but that the  Descriptio Albaniae  regards Ross and Moray as belonging to Scotland Ross is however so moun∣tainous and barren a district that it seems to have been neglected by all parties and left to the Wild Irish of Argyle and it was generally a province of the Hebudian kingdom  Earl of Ross and Lord of the Iles were commonly united titles In John bears them in a treaty with Edward IV of England Till James V circumnavigated the iles and re∣duced them to order they can hardly be regarded as subject to Scotland    The Shetland iles must also not be forgotten They are called  Hialtland  in Norwegian signify∣ing the land of  Hialt  a man's name This word we corrupted to  Yetland  the original name sounding  Yaltland  By another corruption  Yet∣land  laterly became  Shetland  These iles are by D'Anville and others regarded as the real anci∣ent Thule and were perhaps formerly one iland afterward broken by the force of the waves Of the Shetland iles we find little account in the Icelandic writers tho from them Torfaeus has drawn a complete history of the more distant Fareys which as a picture of barbaric society is a curious piece The Shetland iles were sub∣ject to the earls of Orkney as we learn from Torsaeus    The Hebudes  There is no special history of the Hebudes in Icelandic as there is of the Orkneys and their history is of course more obscure  Our writers are so ignorant concerning them that they have even for more than two centuries perverted the very name in an odd manner For since the publication of the notorious History of Hector Boethius at Paris folio our writers have called these iles  Hebrides  I have taken some pains to detect the origin of this blunder The edition of Pliny folio  Venetiis  bears  Ebudes  That of Solinus folio  ib  also bears  Ebudes  The Solinus of Aldus vo has  Haebudes  as have all the editions of Pliny and Solinus since Ptolemy's work has  Ebuda  not  Aebudae  as Buchanan and others put upon no autho∣  ity whatever But Pliny and Solinus were the writers whom Boethius followed and i was be∣ginning to impute his  Hebrides  to an error of himself an amanuensis or the printer Badius Ascensius However i chanced upon an edition of Solinus in which the very source of this error appeared Its title is  Solinus de Memorabilibus Mundi diligenter annotatus et indicio alphabetico prenotatus  In a wooden print is the name of the bookseller Denis Roce Parisiis and on the back of the title is a dedication by Badius Ascensius the printer to  John De Falce  dated  ad idus Julias  M D III The book was printed that year as appears from this date and from its whole form agreeing with the rude Paris press of the end of the fifteenth century and beginning of the sixteenth century before the Stephani arose This edition is so full of typographic errors that it is a disgrace to printing The first word is  Cym  for  Cum  But in names especially  Succinus  for  Sevo Horistenes  for  Boristenes Hecareus  for  Hecataeus  are  all specimens of its gross perversion Among of as  n folio xxii  excipiunt  EBRIDES  insulae qu  nque numero  appears in the text and on the margin  Ebrides  as also in the index prefixt  Ebri∣des  Yet once in f xii  Sed Orcades ab  EBUDIBUS  porro  c occurs so that  Ebrides  was but one  chance and  Ebudes  another with the printer And in same page appears  Ad Arcadibus Thylen usque  for  Ab Orcadibus Thulen usque  As Boethius studied at Paris whence he was called to a professor's chair at Aberdeen it seems evident that he had picked up this edition of Solinus and having no other to consult in Scotland took his  Hebrides  from this clear fountain Such being the case and the name  Hebrides  Late Irish writers say that the Hebrides are so called from king Hiber  a mere blunder the con∣dition of learning and of antiquarian studies in particular among us of Scotland may be more easily guessed at from this simple circumstance than from any argument With us a mere typo∣graphic error remained and passed among all our writers save Buchanan for more than two centuries and a half In any other country such a matter would have been detected at once And i should not wonder to see our writers persist in  Hebrides  from mere shame as the old priest re∣tained his  Mumpsimus  for  Sumpsimus  But our error is confined to ourselves for all foreign writers ever put  Hebudes  In the history of these iles the Pikish kingdom first appears which began there as from them the Piks first spread over Scotland as fully shewn above Solinus describes the state of this king∣dom about the year when he wrote In the Hebudes still belonged to the Piks for in that year Brudi gave Hyona to Columba as Beda tells Adomnan in his life of Columba gives some hints as to their then state But the He∣budes seem to have been left almost desert when the Piks gained Valentia and other fertile posses∣sions on the south and we find not that Columba tried to convert their inhabitants Nor in Irish history or sanctology is any of these ilands men∣tioned except Hyona as the scene of any action whatever Their subjection to the petty kings of  Mann is another proof of their being almost unpeopled Upon these grounds i am convinced that after the Piks began to move south the He∣budes were left almost desert Nay that the Nor∣wegians who settled in them must have been few else they would not have submitted to the petty kings of Mann but have had separate earls or kings In the Hebudes were ceded to Scot∣land and as no inhabitants could leave the conti∣nent for such rude and remote habitations crouds of wild Irish were permitted if not invited to settle among the Norwegians who remained For as the Irish detested the English yoke so they were ever on good terms with the Scotish kings owing to the inrercourse and sameness of language between them and our Dalriads That this was the case appears from the peculiar freshness of their Irish origin to be traditionally found among those ilanders at present and from their language being more perfectly Irish than that of our high∣landers as well as from the evidence of historic facts The chief families are however Norwegi∣ans who remained as principal tenants and the people have more of the Norwegian largeness of limbs and redness of hair than our highlanders But our kings hardly regarded them or the high∣landers as subjects and in the grand contest with Edward I both traitorously allied themselves with the enemy Hence they as well as the high∣landers are unknown in Scotish history nor are once mentioned save in assrays and crimes  About Ketil was made lord of the Hebudes by Harold Harfagre and usurped independency  Torf Orc  I Perhaps the kings of Mann de∣scended from him In Godfrey son of Ha∣rold king of the Hebudes was slain by the Dal∣riads  Tigh Ann Ult  About Gill an earl of the Hebudes is mentioned  Torf  I In the time of Magnus the good king of Norway Duggald was king of the Hebudes  Torf Hist Foerey ad sin  Torfaeus  Orcad  I shews that the northern Hebudes were tributary to the earls of Orkney In Magnus Barefoot king of Norway after subduing the Orkneys passed to the Hebudes and first conquered  Liodhus  now Lewis Then subduing the rest took captive Lagman son of Gudrod king of the Hebudes evidently Lagman son of Godred king of Maun in the  Chronicon Manniae  The Ile of Maun attracts particular notice as the seat of this kingdom It is the  Monaeda  of the ancients as Anglesey is  Mona  It was held by the Irish in the time of Orosius About Ed∣win king of Northumbria conquered the  Mevaniae insulae  as Beda says that is Anglesey and Maun the former ever after retaining the name of Angle∣sey or English ile But in the ninth century Maun was seized by the Norwegian pirates who held it till Harold Harfagre about expelled them It is clear from their speech that the in∣habitants came chiefly from Ireland and it is likely that the kings of the Hebudes were Nor∣wegians from Ireland then overrun with Scandi∣navians In we find the people of Maun sending to the king of Dublin to desire him to appoint a king of Maun  Chron Mann apud Camden  This Irish origin ac∣counts for that odd circumstance of Maun a de∣tached and distant ile being the regal seat of the Hebudian kinglets  APPENDIX TO The Second Volume  APPENDIX To Volume II

island in the county of Dona∣gall an account mostly fabulous is given in the Irish book of Invasions A more credible account is there given of the settlement of the Cruthnii or Picts in North Britain some ages before the Christian aera  Conary the mild king of Ireland A D was a prince of the part of Munster now called the county of Kerry He left three sons The eldest Carbry Riada or the longarmed assisted his cousingerman Cormac king of Ireland in his invasion of North Britain and on concluding a treaty with the Picts the Irish mo∣narch obtained in that country a settlement for Carbry Riada his cousin about the year  The defects and derangements in the Duan are only visible from the year to The loss of a genuine copy of the whole is to be regretted Thus far Mr O'Conor  Only one ancient copy of this poem has yet been found from which a number of modern copies have been made Mr O'Flaherty's copy was equally defec∣tive with Mr O'Conor's After Anbkellach Dungal and Alpin were inserted by transposition and Mr O'Conor thinks the poem corrupted and modernised after that time But a gentleman well versed in the Irish informs me that it seems all equally ancient and by one hand so that there is room to suspect many of the errors to be mistakes of the bard who composed it  This poem is quoted in the last century by Ward in his  Vita Rumoldi  p by Colgan in his  Trias Thau∣maturga  p and by O'Flaherty often in his  Ogygia  Sir George Mackenzie refers to it p of his De∣fence of the Antiquity of the Royal line A copy of it is said to be in the Psalter of Cashel now missing but

period the Norwegian on the contrary labours under an excess of materials owing to the number of I celandic Sagas chiefly relating to Norway the parent country of Ice∣land Snorro's history in particular is merely that of Norway tho his first book contains the Swedish kings down to the conquest of Sweden by Ivar Vidfatme king of Denmark about the year because those princes who gained the command of all Norway were descended from the Swedish race The work of Snorro is very prolix and full of private anecdotes being like the other Sagas Memoirs and not History  Twenty or more petty monarchies prevailed in Norway till the ninth century About the year Ingiald king of Sweden was vanquished by Ivar king of Denmark Olaf son of Ingiald retired to the north∣west of Sweden and founded a kingdom His son Halfdan Whitbein by the help of many Swedish re∣fugees subdued a great part of the southeast of Nor∣way about present Christiana To him succeeded Eystein his son king of the said part of Norway an∣ciently called Raumarik and Westfold His son was Halfdan and Halfdan's son Gudreyd next Olaf son of Gudreyd and Ragnvald son of Olaf all successive kings of the same territory Then followed Halfdan Swart brother of Olaf and son of Gudreyd with whom the real history of Norway dawns It is remarkable that Snorro who gives the above account makes every king father and son till the real history begins when no such succession is found but various contingencies happen Now as it is impossible that succession should be regular in a barbaric kingdom and irregular as it became civilized Snorro's genealogies are certainly false till the real history dawns The names may be  real but that every king succeeded his father is ficti∣tious in itself and inconsistent with all real accounts of the barbaric government of the Goths  About Halfdan Swart king of Westfold and Raumarik subdued two or three other petty kingdoms  About HARALD I  Harfagre  succeeded his fa∣ther Halfdan Swart and about conquering the several petty kingdoms became master of all Norway He died in    Eric l Blodox  a son of Harald attempted to seize the kingdom but was forced to retire to England  HAKON I the Good a son of Harald who had been educated in England by king A thelstan was cho∣sen king He was a Christian but could not convert his subjects and was slain in after reigning years  HARALD II  Grafeld  son of Eric Blodox and his brothers got the sovereignty But  Hakon  a power∣ful earl held Drontheim the province in which the capital ftood since Norway became one kingdom In earl Hakon was forced to fly to Denmark King Harald was slain in    Hakon  was made EARL of Norway by the Da∣nish king upon homage This earldom lasted till when Hakon was slain  OLAF I  Trygvason  a descendant of Harald Harfagre coming from Ireland assumed the kingdom Tho he reigned only four years he is much celebrated by northern history He was certainly a great prince and with much courage and conduct forced his whole subjects to become Christians Iceland was also con∣verted and Vinland a part of North America disco∣vered during this short but glorious reign He was killed in a sea sight against the kings of Denmark and Sweden in the year  Norway was partly subject to Denmark and Sweden partly to earl  Eric  son of earl Hakon In earl Eric went to England  OLAF II the Saint a relation of Olaf Tryg∣vason coming from England assumed the scepter of Norway This saint was of the church militant for his long reign is full of incidents and enterprize and occupies a fourth part of Snorro's work Olaf was slain fighting against the Danes August He is the patron saint of Norway    Swein  son of Canute the great king of Eng∣land and Denmark ruled Norway till when he fled to Hardaknut his brother in Denmark  MAGNUS I the GOOD son of Olaf the saint was chosen king of Norway Having agreed with Har∣daknut king of Denmark that he who survived should inherit the dominions of the other in Magnus the good became KING OF NORWAY AND DENMARK He died in and Swein a descendant of Canute the Great acquired the crown of Denmark  HARALD III  Hardrad  brother of Olaf the Saint became king of Norway After reigning years he was slain in a battle against Harold king of England Sept  The history of Norway being little known the author was in∣duced to continue the series to the end  OLAF III  Kyrre  or the Peaceable son of Harald Hardrad began his reign In he founded Biorgen or Bergen and built a stone church there and improved the old wooden one In he built a stone church at Nidaros now Drontheim and placed the relics of St Olaf in it He died Sept after a happy reign of years  MAGNUS II  Baerfetta  son of Olaf Kyrre be∣came king  Hakon  was however chosen king of part of Norway but died in In Magnus under∣took his famous expedition to the Orkneys and He∣budes which he subdued In he went on another expedition and was slain in Ireland in  SIGURD I  Jorsalafar  EYSTEIN and OLAF the three sons of Magnus Baerfetta reign together Si∣gurd is famed for his expedition into the Mediterranean and valiant actions in distant realms In Olaf died Eystein in Sigurd in  MAGNUS III  Blinda  son of Sigurd became king of Norway But half of the kingdom was assigned to  Harald Gil  son of Magnus Baerfetta In Ha∣rald is defeated by Magnus but returning with assist∣ance from Denmark he takes Magnus captive castrates him and puts out his eyes  HARALD IV  Gil  reigned one year and was slain in a conspiracy  SIGURD II and INGI I sons of Harald Gil are made kings In EYSTEIN another son of Harald Gil coming from Scotland is also made king  with his brothers In Eystein ravaged the eastern shores of Scotland and England burned Aberdeen c Drontheim or Nidaros was in made an archie∣piscopal see by the Pope In Sigurd was slain in a battle with Ingi his brother Eystein fell in and HAKON was chosen in his stead Ingi was slain in  HAKON II  Herdabreid  son of Sigurd be∣comes king of Norway slain in  MAGNUS IV son of Erling an earl was cho∣sen king  Sigurd  son of Sigurd reigned over a province or two In the famous faction of the Birkabeins appeared in Vika or the southeast of Norway and continued long to give and take away the royalty In they made  Eystein  son of Eystein king who being slain in they appointed SVERIR in his stead  {inverted ⁂}  Thus far from the chronology of the Three First Vo∣lumes of Snorro l  tely printe  at Copenhagen  The rest is from an abstract of Norwegian history at the end of  Rami Nori Regnum  Snorro ends at Suerir The history of Nor∣wa  after this is taken from Icelandic histories of different reigns as  Suerissaga Hakon saga  c and from charters The fourth volume of Torfaeus begins at Suerir but his chronology is inaccurate and he rarely quotes authorities Norway has no native historian for Theodoric the monk who ends at Suerir was surely a German  SUERIR was elected king by the Birkbeins after great tumult and many battles with E  ling and Magnus son of Erling he at last became king of Nor∣way He was long infested by the Baglar a powerful faction whom he at length suppressed He reigned years and died in  HAKON III son of Suerir reigned years died  GUTHORM  Sigurdson  grandson of Suerir an infant of four years of age Hakon Galin and Peter Steiper governed for him Died  INGI II  Baa  son  infested by Erling chief of the Baglar and by Philip who succeeded Erling He gave part of his kingdom to Philip and so appeased the Baglar Reigned years Died  HAKON IV  Torfaeus is so inaccurate as to call this Hakon II and the  next  Hakon VI  Hakonson  a boy of thirteen He gave part of his kingdom to Earl Skuli his father∣inlaw  to avoid sedition but the Earl rebelling Hakon crushed him and after reigned in peace He carried on a war against Scotland with little success died on the expedition and was buried at Drontheim or Nidaros after reigning years  MAGNUS V son of Hakon had been de∣clared king in four years before his father's death His virtues equalled his father's He cultivated peace and reformed the laws whence he was called  Lagebetter  He died after reigning years  ERIC II son of Magnus carried on a long war against the Danes Reigned years died  HAKON V another son of Magnus continued the war with the Danes reigned years died  MAGNUS VI  Smeck  son of Eric made king of Norway and Sweden when a child and added to his realm the province of Sconen in Denmark He gave Sweden to his son Eric and Norway to his son Ha∣kon Eric having died the Swedes rebelled against Magnus and put him in prison in the th year of his reign Being delivered by his son Hakon in he passed the remainder of his life in Norway He perished in passing the bay of Bomelfiord  HAKON VI son of Magnus had Norway during the life of his father whom to redeem from captivity he carried on a long war against the Swedes He took to wife Margaret daughter of Waldemar king of Denmark and died in after reigning years  OLAF IV son of Hakon VI was first chosen king of Denmark and on the death of his father acceded to Norway He died without children and thus left both his kingdoms to his mother Margaret who added a third by conquering Albert king of Sweden Sweden was delivered from the Danes by Gustaf Wase but Norway has ever since remained attached to Denmark  The  Baglar  a faction raised by the clergy disturbed Norway much in the th century Magnus V exclude  the deputis of the people from the National Assembly which after consisted only of nobles and clergy so that the power of the king and of the people was lost He also introduced hereditary digniti  s Magnus VI liv∣ing chiefly in Sweden Norway was left to the power of her nobles and fell to a condition from which she never recovered  NUMBER V  Kings of Denmark  IT may safely be denied that even the fabulous part of Danish Swedish or Norwegian history can be carried to an earlier date than the year after Christ The number of kings of whom according to the soundest principles of chronology not more than ten years at a medium can be assigned to each instead of thirty or a generation as absurdly put by the northern antiquaries serves to ascertain this epoch The Sla∣vonic nations of Poland and Russia who had writers rather before the Scandinavian kingdoms are yet con∣tented to begin even their sabulous history in the se∣venth and eighth centuries In digesting this series of Danish kings Torfaeus is followed as to the names preceding the ninth century his arguments against Saxo concerning that period being conclusive But that part is sabulous not historical and when Torfaeus comes to the ninth century he errs by supposing that his Islandic sagas of sufficiently fabulous faith to check the fables of Saxo could be set against Eginhart Adam of Bremen and others who wrote centuries before any of these Islandic Sagas were imagined Adam of Bre∣men given the succession of many Danish and Swedish kings of the ninth and tenth centuries and his autho∣rity is here followed as a far nearer writer both in time and place than those Sagas which being written in Iceland shew a peculiar ignorance concerning Den∣mark the most southerly of the Scandinavian king∣doms As Adam is confessedly right in his account of Swedish kings he is certainly so in that of the Danish nor is to be supposed that he took kings of Jutland for those of Denmark as some Danish antiquaries dream for he distinguishes Jutland by its own name or by that of  Dania Cismarina  as distinct from Denmark or Sealand whose kings he mentions And as he precedes Saxo by a whole century and the Islandic sagas by two and had his accounts from Swein II king of Denmark himself he deserves more faith by every rule of his∣toric authority than any later writer  From Torsaeus and Mallet  Skiold  say about  A D  Fridlef I  Frodi I  Fridlef II  Havar  Frodi II  Vermund  Olas I  Dan  Frodi III  Halfdan I  about  A D  Fridlef III  Olaf II  Frodi IV  Ingiald  Halfdan II  Frodi V  Helgo  Hrolf Krak about A D  Interreign of uncertain length the kingdom being split in divisions  Torfaeus in his  Series  p here inserts  Hroar Valdar Ha∣rald Halsdan  as ancestors of Ivar Vidfatme but not as kings of Denmark as appears from the after part of his work  Ivar Vidfatme  From ancient French and German writers Eginhart Adam of Bremen  c  Heriold perhaps the same with the Harald Hyldet∣and of Icelandic sagas A D  Sigfrid perhaps the Sigurd Ring of Icelandic accounts  Godfrid  Heming  Heriold and Reginfrid This last is perhaps Regnar Lodbrog who must have flourished about as in his grandsons slew St Edmund the king Adam of Bremen p mentions  Inguar filius Lodparchi  about as ravaging France  Horic I  Horic II  Sigifrid  Helgo  Olaf king of Sweden conquered

Good  Swein II to  NUMBER VI  Kings of Sweden  The more ancient Swedish kings are from Snorro who goes down to Ivar Vidfatme about A D in a clear succession After which they are drawn from Adam of Bremen from scattered parts of Snorro and from the  Series Regum Daniae  of Torfaeus the Swedes having no native history till the fourteenth century Odin and Niord are mythologic and have no place

Snorro's series closes he now proceeding to Norwegian history Adam of Bremen begins with Biorn A D and from Ivar Vidfatme to Biorn the series is very obscure Snorro does not even mention one king of Upsal or Sweden after Ingiald till the time of Harald Harfagre king of Norway or about the year when Eric occurs  It is said from Icelandic Sagas that the Danes held Sweden in subjection for a long time and the kings were generally those of Denmark From Lagerbring's History of Sweden the following Icelandic series appears Harald Hildetand grandson of Ivar by a daughter Sigurd Ring nephew of the last Regnar Lodbrog son of Sigurd Ring But this succession is very doubtful  From Adam of Bremen  Biorn I  Amund I  Olaf I  Biorn  Those in Italic letter are not named by Adam  II  Eric  I  Olaf II conquers Denmark  Adam  p  Eric  II  Ring  Eric III  Amund II  Stenkil  I  Eric IV  Olaf III Skotkonung  Amund Jacob  Hakon    Stenkil II  Ingi the Pious    After this the series is clear as the Danish is after Gormo  NUMBER VII  Earls of the Orkneys  THE first number on the right hand is the page of Torfaeus and the second that of the Orkneyinga Saga in which the history of each may be found  Ar the end of Orkneyinga Saga is a bad list of the Earls in which Cormac a monk who preached in the Orkneys is given as of the number    From Torsaeus and the Orkn Saga  From the Diploma in

mistaking Harald I and II for the same person a common cause of error in old chronicles The Orkneyinga Saga being writ∣ten so near the time is full and veracious concerning these omitted earls It ends with Jon and the account of Torfaeus after is very lame so that the Diploma deserves much credit To Magnus V he adds an  Argisel  who witnesses a charter that year but had surely only the title and an

AND MODERN HISTORY OF EUROPE  BY  JOHN PINKERTON  LONDON PRINTED BY JOHN NICHOLS FOR GEORGE NICOL PALLMALL  MDCCLXXXVII  PREFACE  BEING occupied with a most laborious research into the history of Scotland preceding the year the author found it incontrovertibly settled from Tacitus Beda and the whole ancient accounts that the  Caledonii  or  Picti  the ancient and still chief inhabitants of that country came to it from German Scythia or Scandinavia This led him to enquire how the Scythians came to give their name even to the most northern parts of Ger∣many from the earliest days of Grecian literature down to a very late period He found that the first Greek authors had certain knowlege that the Scythians had proceeded from Little or Ancient Scythia on the Euxine even to the extremity of Germany peopling the whole intervening country and that the Latin classics had the same knowlege But that the reason why Isidorus Beda Paulus Diaconus the Geographer of Ravenna and in∣numerable writers of the middle ages call Scan∣dinavia peculiarly Scythia was that Jornandes who wrote about had imagined that the most ancient Scythians proceeded from it about years before Christ Hence in the darkness of the middle ages Scandinavia was regarded as the true Scythia or Scythia Antiqua  As the author was resolved if a Spanish proverb may be used to  leave nothing in the inkhorn  knowing that without going to the very bottom of a subject like this no point of it can be clear he began a course of reading all the authors that could anywise illustrate the early population of Europe Proceeding chronologically thro the Greek and Roman writers and the most important ones of the middle ages he reserved modern authors to the last that they might minister no matter of prejudice for truth can only be had pure in it's fountains 'This great labour as indexes were never consulted save in moral authors as Aristotle Plato c or others who could have almost no∣thing on the subject consumed more than a year tho eight hours a day were almost constantly alloted to it and such close attention goes a great way in a little time After this course of ancient reading he proceeded to the moderns and found himself in quite a new world indeed For a subject so capa∣ble of superabundant illustration from the multi∣tude of authorities if industry alone with some degree of clear judgement be applied has been totally lost in a mass of superficiality and error For error is the constant and inevitable produce of superficiality The truth is always at the bot∣tom and if a man does not know all upon an an∣tiquarian subject he knows nothing nay less than nothing inasmuch as error is worse than ignorance When all is redd upon such a theme it is also a great pleasure to reflect that the truth must be known for ancient authoritics are facts in history  and incontrovertible one may be opposed to another but when all concur for any modern to oppose is in utter frenzy to dash his head against the wall of a castle After reading all upon such a subject one is therefore thoroughly master of it and no information can remain that can infringe the absolute knowledge acquired Antiquarian re∣searches when complete are infallible for no new facts can occur in antiquity To talk of opinion upon such subjects is to talk as a child for opinion can never alter facts a man may opine that snow is black or that a Scythian is a Celt but he will be left to his delusion while the facts remain to eternity  Perhaps a more arduous task never was under∣taken than what is here submitted to the reader The materials collected would have composed a vast volume but this was foreign to the author's intention The toil of compressing was far more great than that of dilating would have been A vast volume might have been written in half the time employed in these few pages But great ad∣vantages attend the progress of science from con∣centrating into one strong focus a number of scat∣tered beams Error is melted by the fierce light and vanishes beneath it's power Would to heaven we had fewer large books and more small ones No greater advantage could arise to science than if authors would follow the example of Tacitus who as Montesquieu well observes ABRIDGED ALL BECAUSE HE SAW ALL  The learned have on no subject fallen into so numerous and gross errors as with regard to the Scythians They have been confounded with the Celts tho all the ancient writers oppose this and distinguish no two races of men more widely than Scythians and Celts They have been taken for Sarmatians tho all the ancients also oppose this and from the days of Herodotus especially di∣stinguish the Scythians from the Sarmatians They have been by late authors of the first fame con∣founded with Tartars an error of all others the most ridiculous for the Tartars were absolutely unknown to the ancients till the Huns who were indeed strictly speaking Monguls not Tartars  The name  Tartar  as vague with us as Indian is in fact of small extent It is not more ancient than the th cen∣turry and was originally that of a small nation conquered by the Monguls under Zenghizcan but by a caprice usual in names is given by us to almost half of Asia The Usbeks are now the chief Tartar nation The Kalmucs are not Tartars but Monguls a vast people of a different language The Turks are of the same race with the Huns Monguls not Tartars according to De Guignes The Tungusians another vast people are quite distinct from the Tartars On the east of the Lena the nations are from America and differ from all the other Asiatics as the rev Mr Tooke shews in his  Russia  See  De Guignes Hist des Huns Tooke's Russia D' Anville Geographic  c  appeared and seized on the countries of the eastern Scythae These points are discussed in this essay But that the reader may proceed to it with clear and precise ideas he may be here told what he will find fully displayed in it namely that the  Scythians were neither Celts Sarmatians nor Tartars no more than a horse is an elephant a lion or a tiger but a horse so the Scythians were Scythians a distinct peculiar and marked people first called Scythians by the Greeks who retained that name for them till the destruction of Constantinople in the th century while the Latins upon forming a disagreeable acquaintance with them called them Goths as they also called themselves  Now tho almost all Europe be possessed by the descendents of the Goths a people from whom as shall be shewn the Greeks and Romans also sprung and the Goths transcended even when barbarians all nations in wisdom and war yet such is our ignorance who are at present but slowly eloping from barbarism that the name of Goth the sacred name of our fathers  The Count du Buat forcibly expresses this in his first sentence 'Les anciens peuples de l'Europe que nous appellons Barbares et qui sont nos Peres'  Hist Ane des Peuples de l'Europe  Paris  Tome    is an object of detestation This schoolboy idea prevails to this hour in the first writers so true is the remark of Dryden  Men are but children of a larger growth  It springs solely from our love for Rome itself a Gothic state which we draw from Roman writers at school and our knowlege that the other Goths destroyed the Roman empire Instead of turning our admiration to that great people who could annihilate so potent an empire instead of blessing  the period that delivered all kingdoms from the dominion of one we execrate our progenitors to whom we are indebted for all our present happi∣nesss We look on the Goths as enemies of science without once reflecting that wisdom is at any time superior to science and that the Goths only de∣spised the science prevalent on the decline of Rome which was folly and is regarded as such by us at present  How different was the opinion entertained of the Goths by the Greeks and Romans What ap∣plause of the justice of the fortitude of the tem∣perance of the wisdom of the Scythians in the Grecian page from Herodotus to the latest period What applause of the same virtues of the same people under the names of Scythians or Goths in the Roman works even after they had seized the Roman empire Let us attend to the last a little as more immediately concerning us and that we may know how shockingly we err in our puerile disesteem of our fathers Read Augustin  de Civitate Dei lib  I  capp    et  on their cle∣mency and  lib  III where he says that the Goths on taking Rome spared so many of the sena∣tors that it is more a wonder that they slew some Orosius  lib  VII tells that tho desirous of prey they abstained from blood and  c ult  calls Alaric 'the mildest of kings' See the whole fifth and seventh books of Salvianus  de Gubernatione Dei  Hear Theodoric the Gothic king himself dic∣tating to his secretary Gassiodorus  Epist lib  II and you hear the voice of such kings as render  themselves gods to mankind 'Favout justice Employ courage in the defence of innocence that amid the crimes of other nations you may shew the justice of the Goths' And in the same book  Epist  'Do you imitate our Goths whose courage in battle can only be equalled by their domestic modesty' And  Epist  'Let the wars of other kings be crowned with the spoils and ruin of captured cities It is our purpose with the help of God so to conquer that our subjects shall only grieve that they acquired our protection so late' And to pass many such book VIII  epist  'This is the praise of the Goths to preserve inviolate the laws of humanity  These and many similar passages may be found in the Prolegomena to  Grotii Hist Goth  Single sentences of Idatius of Victor Vitensis of the mock Hist Arcana given to Proco∣pius weigh nothing against the number of superior witnesses in favour of the Goths The Romans often shed more blood in one war than the Goths in conquering the Roman empire Rude conquerors tho ever so few and merciful always intro∣duce their laws and manners but the language of Italy France Spain which is mere Latin corrupted by time suffi∣ciently shews that very few of the old inhabitants perished The desolation of some parts of Italy was owing to the seat of em∣pire being removed to Constantinople and the senators abandoning their Italian villas in order to be near the court So much in answer to a respectable writer Dr Robertson who in his  View of Society  prefixt to the history of Ch V has fallen into mistakes on this subject  ' Rome Rome what were thy laurels to these Great and divine people it is no wonder that the few virtu∣ous Romans should as Salvianus says fly to you their enemies for protection and that heaven  should in your favour have delivered the world from the tyrannic dotage of Rome  Such virtues prevailed among the whole Goths from the extremity of Scandinavia to the Vandals in Africa the last of whom tho debased by an enervate clime are yet the chief objects of the praise of Salvianus Hospitality was particularly sacred The Burgundian laws enact 'Whoever refuses his house or fire to a stranger let him pay a large fine If any man travelling on his busi∣ness ask lodging of a Burgundian and it can be proved that he has shewn the stranger the house of a Roman let the Burgundian pay the same fine to the Roman and an equal fine to the public trea∣sury' A remarkable instance of regard to hospi∣tality also occurs in Procopius  Hist lib  III  cap  and  lib  IV  c  concerning the Gepidae a celebrated Gothic nation on the west of present Hungary An abstract of it follows According to Lombardic institutions the crown of Lombardy was after the death of Vaces to pass to Ildisgal This prince being however expelled by intrigues retired to the Gepidae Audouin who had seized the throne of Lombardy sent to demand Ildisgal of the Gepidae his neighbours The emperor Justinian sent an embassy to support the request Torisin king of the Gepidae who had just made peace with the Lombards and Romans called a council and shewed the danger of refusing But the council resolved unanimously  That it would be better for the whole nation wives and children to perish than commit such a sacrilege against the laws  of hospitality  That this continued the case among the uncorrupted Goths of Scandinavia appears from Adam of Bremen a writer of the eleventh century who says all the people of Scandinavia Danes Normans Swedes are most hospitable especially the Swedes with whom no reproach could be greater than to refuse lodging to a stranger and Grotius tells that Charles an ancient king of Sweden made a law that the house which refused a stranger should be burnt to the ground  Of their wisdom let Herodotus speak and Dio who calls them the wisest of mankind Of their courage let their enemies tell and we their sons who are here enjoying the countries which their swords won from the Romans their civilised bre∣thren who had conquered all nations yet yielded to them Of their learning when by circumstances they advanced in society in different countries as after explained let the Greeks their eldest pro∣geny who enjoyed these circumstances declare the Romans next and the modern Europaeans the last but not least of their sons But their learning even in unsocial wilds and circumstances of society which precluded attention to elegance while necessity was the law is a curious subject and shall be briefly touched  Herodotus  lib  IV  c  says the Scythians were both learned and wise Zamolxis the early lawgiver of the Goths is well known and so is Dicenens Anacharsis was the next Scythic phi∣losopher he was of the royal family his brother Cadreda and nephew Indathyrsus being kings  of the Getae or Parental Goths peculiarly so called He lived with Solon years before Christ Menander the celebrated founder of the new comedy and whose drama was called the school of wisdom was a Goth of Getia as Strabo book VII tells us from his works and gives us the lines apparently from one of his prologues  For all the Thracians but the Getae chief  From whom I glory to derive my birth  Have never yet been cold to female beauty  Toxaris a Scythian was a learned physician whom Lucian introduces as chief interlocutor in his admirable dialogue entituled  Toxaris  or  On Friendship  which is not only the most virtuous but the most entertaining of Lucian's works be∣ing enlivened with many tales and anecdotes They who would know the virtues of the ancient Scythians are also especially referred to it  As to the later Scythians or Goths who sub∣verted the Roman empire the historian of English poetry shewing our mistakes as to their hatred of learning and the arts well observes that 'their enemies have been their historians' Such learning and arts as were then in vogue were indeed worthy of their contempt as of our's now The Goths knew that a learned king was useless in their then situation of war and the sole example  that can be found of their imagined contempt of letters sprung from this idea It occurs in Pro∣copius  Hist Goth lib  I  c  where queen Ama∣lasuntha wishing to teach her son Alaric letters the Gothic chiefs object to it that arms and not letters had been formerly taught to their kings Surely this passage so often brought as a proof of their ignorance was a proof of their wonted wis∣dom as events shew For Theodoric who was unlearned was the best and greatest of kings Theodahat who was learned brought the first Gothic empire in Italy to utter ruin  We look at the Goths thro a most false and im∣perfect medium that of the Roman writers of a barbarous age And we have lost the noblest mo∣numents of their Gothic history as Pliny's Twenty Books on the German war the Gothic history of Dio and that of Dexippus of which Photius  Cod  gives a brief hint Yet even the most barbarous writers in the dotage of Rome bear sufficient witness of the Gothic glory The very generals who alone succeeded against the Goths were their countrymen Stilicho was a Vandal or German Goth Belisarius was a Goth of Thrace See Claudian and others for the first Procopius  de Bello Vandal lib  I  c  II for the last Instead of imitating the barbarous Roman writers in their contempt of the ruder Goths let us imi∣tate the Goths in their contempt of doting Rome and hear them express it "When we would brand an enemy with disgrace we call him a Roman comprehending under this one name of Roman  whatever is base is cowardly is covetous is false is vicious"  Luitprandi Legatio apud Muratori Script Ital  Indeed the contempt we bear to the Goths resembles that of a spendthrift heir to a great and prudent father It is as foolish as that of the Por∣tuguese for the Castillans so well held out by Melchior de Santa Cruz who tells that a Cas∣tillan going into a shop in a Portuguese village a boy ran and told his mother to come and speak to a Castillan Upon which his mother chid him severely for affronting the gentleman with such a name while the Spaniard knew it to be his highest honour  It shall only be further observed in this pre∣face that the author's attention to his quotations has been most accurate and sacred Most of them he has compared repeatedly with the originals This became the more necessary as inaccurate quotations are the grand defects of the literature of this century if we except Germany and Scan∣dinavia only where if an author were to quote falsely he would go near to endure the character of a scoundrel and a liar Indeed no literary crime is equal to this for public faith attends an author and infamy ought always to attend his intentional abuse of it nay in part his careless∣ness for a man is a very bad member of society who teaches it error compared to which even ignorance itself is knowlege The misquotations and misconstructions of Pelloutier and many others upon similar subjects must shock every reflecting  mind for most readers take quotations on trust The author has seldom if ever taken a quotation on trust but has commonly verified those few which struck him at secondhand with the origi∣nals This plan he earnestly recommends to such readers as wish to attain complete and immediate knowlege of the important facts here developed For this end a list of the books and editions used is prefixt This list may also serve as a directory for those who chuse to study the subject in it's fountains and will save much trouble for had the author put down the other books he has pe∣rused for this design to no purpose as there was nothing in them the number would have been doubled The author can safely pledge his whole character in life that he has never intentionally altered or omitted a single letter in a quotation nor ever given it the least bias from it's open direct meaning No toil has been spared to guard against mistakes this little work has been revised and rerevised and revised again but our own errors singularly escape our eyes Yet can there be no mistake touching the grand and leading facts which stand on the authorities of all anti∣quity The author's toil was too enormous for him to trifle with any hypothesis and thus lose his labour or any part of it He sought for facts alone The sole pleasure surely in a research of this kind is purely mathematical the delicious delight in reposing one's mind upon truth For tho the truth in historic research be far from  mathematical yet that highest probability here called  Historic Truth  consists in this that tho you cannot demonstrate it true yet you can prove all opposite opinions to be false so that as truth is one and no two opposite opinions can be

the East and between the Euxine and Mediterranean seas  CHAPTER I  The Scythians Getoe and Goths all one people  THE subject meant to be briefly treated in this dissertation is so extensive and im∣portant that two vast volumes might well be occupied with it alone For upon it as a wide and perpetual basis stands the whole history of Europe excepting only that of Russia Poland and Hungary All the rest is in the hands of the progeny of the Goths or as we may justly say of the Goths and there actually exists in Europe at  this moment a sixth supreme empire equal to the Scythian Assyrian Persian Grecian or Roman For the colonies and dominions of the Europeans in America and Asia may surely be put as equivalent at least to those of the Romans in Asia and Africa This Sixth Empire is not in∣deed under one head but neither was the Gre∣cian save for the short reign of Alexander Nor let us deceived by vulgar blindness esteem it a disgrace to be called by our real name of GOTHS but rather exult in the glorious title For as shall afterwards be shewn the Greeks themselves were Goths being originally Pelasgi a Scythic or Gothic colony and the Romans also were of the same stem And tho we misled by a puerile love of the Romans revile the ruder Goths our fathers as despisers of learning and the arts be∣cause they scorned the sophistical reading and fan∣tastic arts prevalent on the decline of the Roman empire which we at present scorn yet as shewn in the preface the Goths were the friends of every elegant art and useful science and when not constrained to arms alone by the inevitable situa∣tion and spirit of their society they carried every art and science to heights unknown before as the ancient Greeks and modern Europeans might wit∣ness In wisdom that perfection of human nature  And tho no science fairly worth the seven  ancient authors  Dio apud Jornand de rebus Get c Herodot IV Strabo lib VII  call the rude Goths the first of mankind And in arms what people equalled those who conquered the Romans who had con∣quered all who without military discipline overcame the greatest military discipline in the world who rushing at once as lightning from heaven dashed the strong and deeprooted oak of Roman power to pieces and scattered the nume∣rous trophies that adorned its branches over the surrounding fields  Before proceeding further i must apologise to the reader for compressing my own materials for the present disquisition and which might have filled a large quarto volume into such contracted bounds For tho i am a declared enemy to large books yet to the learned reader it may seem au∣dacious even to attempt so vast a theme in such small compass But he will consider that the pur∣pose of this work into which my researches into Scotish history led me forbids my entering into the subject so fully as its importance warrants As M de Guignes has obliged the world with an History of the Huns in Four Quarto Volumes fraught with all that information which his great learning in the Eastern tongues enabled him to give so it is earnestly to be wished that some writer of eminent learning industry and ability would give us an History of the Scythians at as great or greater extent Such a work would be of the utmost advantage both to ancient and modern history Yet tho confined to brevity every toil has been exerted to render the present attempt veracious accurate and distinct  It is proper first to shew that  Scythae Getae Gothi  were but different names for one and the same people as we call them  Spaniards  whom the French call  Espagnols  the Italians  Spagnuoli  or as the French call the English  Anglois  the Italians  Inglesi  The learned reader will smile at my think∣ing it necessary to explain a matter so well known as the identity of the Scythians Getae and Goths but this tract is meant for the public at large and it is always better to tell a reader what he may per∣haps know than run the risque of obscuring a whole work by omitting what he may not know I shall however be very brief on this article re∣ferring those who wish for more information upon it to Sheringham  De Gent Angl Orig c  Pelloutier  Hist des Celtes  and Ihre  Praefat ad Glossar SuioGoth    Of the  Scythians  we find a most ample account given by Herodotus and which occupies almost all his Fourth Book In the same book he also mentions the  Getae  telling us that Darius subdued them in advancing against the wandering Scythians who lived on the other side of the Ister or Danube and adding a remarkable circumstance that the Getae believed in the immortality of the soul and that they were the bravest and most just of the Thracians Thus from the earliest periods of history we find mention of the Scythae and Getae as only divided by a river but this is quoted solely to shew that these names are thus early re∣corded  AEschylus who flourished about fifty years before Hero∣dotus is perhaps the first who mentions the Scythae  c  In Prometheo  They are the Galactophagi or Milkeaters  i e  Pastoral people of Homer as his Hippomolgi are the Sarmatae Iliad xiii  init  and Strabo Hesiod has Galactophagi  After this we find them mentioned by almost every Greek writer even familiarly for Geta is a common name for a slave in Greek comedy and in Terence's translations the Greeks procuring many slaves from these their barbarous brethren either by art or force  But the name of  Goths  is not near so ancient the very first mention of it being in the time of the emperor Decius in the year of Christ as Mr Gibbon shews At which time a part of them burst from Getia into the empire under Cneva and Decius attempting to repell them from Thrace was conquered and slain After this we find them as frequently in the Latin authors by the names of  Getae  or  Gothi  as formerly the  Scythians  in the Greek and as Mr Gibbon well observes all the Greek writers after this period still uniformly call those  Scythae  whom the Latin authors denomi∣nate  Gothi  For the more exactness it shall now be shewn  That the Getae and Gothi were the same  That the Getae or Gothi were the same with the Scythae  I  The Getae and Gothi the same  This might almost admit of proof from the identity of the word and identic situation of the people were there not other irrefragable evidences at hand The reader will please to remember that the Ro∣mans as the Greeks and as the modern Ger∣mans Scandinavians and many other nations never gave the letter G a soft found but always pronounced it hard as we do in  go get  c not as we use in  german gesture  c Now in the Grecian dialects the vowels are often changed and aspiration omitted and it is probable that the name  is merely the name properly borne by the nation and as pronounced by them to wit  Gothi  softened to the delicacy of Greek pronunciation as the Italians soften  English  to  Inglesi  We use as much freedom nay often more ourselves in many names of countries as  French  for

wanderer  indeed observes that Get and Got is the same identic word implying an∣ciently as he says a soldier  But not to insist further upon this the following authorities will infallibly prove that  Getae  and  Gothi  are synonymous words  We learn from Suidas that Dio entitled his history of the Goths  or the  Getic  His∣tory Dio wrote his Roman History under Alex∣ander Severus about the year but probably lived to see the attack of the Goths upon the em∣pire in and wrote this work now unhappily lost in consequence of the public curiosity raised by that event  Spartian who wrote under Diocletian about the year or within fifty years of the first ap∣pearance  of the name Gothi is alone a complete evidence For in his life of Antoninus Caracallus  n    p  of the  Hist Aug Script ed var    vo  he says  Gotti Getae dicerentur  the Goths were then called Getae  And again in his life of Antoninus Geta  n    p    Geticus quasi Gotticus  '  Geticus  as we would now say  Gotticus  '  Claudian always calls the Goths  Getae  and entitles his poem on the Gothie war  De Bello Getico  Sidonius Apollinaris in his poems frequently calls the Goths  Getae  and in the epistle to Trige∣tius he calls the Ostrogoths  Massagetae  Ausonius Idyl speaking of the Goths says  Quae vaga Sauromates fibi junxeral agmina Chunis  Quaeque GETIS fociis lstrum adsultabat Alanus  Orosius  lib I c  says  Getae qui et nune Gothi  'the Getae who are now also called Gothi'  Saint Jerome in  praef Epis    ad Galat  says that the Goths were anciently called Getae And in his own Epist he uses  Getae  for  Gothi  Ennodius in his Panegyric to Theodoricus king of the Goths  Nam illud quo ore celebrandum est quod  GETICI  instrumenta roboris dum provides ne interpellentur  tia nostra custodis  Procopius  'For they say the Goths are a Getic race'  Jornandes entitles his history  De Getarum sive Gothorum origine et rebus gestis  and con∣stantly uses  Getae  and  Gothi  as synonymous In his work  De Regn Success  he says Decius  bellantibus Getis occubuit  Isidorus  Origin  lib ix c says the Getae and Gothi are the same  There is not even a shade of an authority on the other side tho within these two centuries the blunders of superficial learning on this subject  are amazing Cluverius  In Germania Antiq  fol  led the van by asserting on  his own  authority that the  Gothi  were the  Gutones  or  Gothones  of Pomerellia who went and ate up the Getaebecause Cluverius was himself a native of Pomerellia  He was born at Dantzick in the heart of the country of the Gothones  Dantiscum Cluverii

Goths went from  Gothland  in Sweden a name un∣known till the Thirteenth or Fourteenth century and rising merely from some property of the coun∣try  Cluverius says it is called  Gudske  and  Gudland  and  Gul∣land  from the  goodness  of the soil But in Icelandic Sagas it is  Gosaland  or  Gautaland terra equorum  and was probably so called from its horses as was the isle Gotland Prolemy places  Gutae  in Scandinavia opposite the  Gutones  of Prussia from whom they seem to have sprung See Part II The first author Grotius quotes for the name of  Gotland  it Sweden is Baron Herberstein  ante    annos  and ate up the Getae about three centuries before Christbecause Grotius was embassadour from the Queen of Sweden to France and bound as he says in his preface to do all in his power for the honour of that kingdom Such infants are men of learning Grotius has had his followers and of late D'Anville follows Cluverius from whose works he is indeed a frequent plagiary and adds this only and sapient reason  Mem de l'Acad des Infer Tome xxv  that the Goths were Germans because the names of their princes c resemble the German not the Scythic or Getic But he ought to have known that the Greeks from whom alone we have any Scythic or Getic names totally perverted all barbaric names nay often translated them for Ardshir they give us Artaxerxes c Agathyrsi Amazones c are mere Greek translations or rather metamorphoses The names which D'Anville must allude to are  those in  ric  c as  Theodoric  and the like to which similar names may be found among the Germans as Orgetorix c This the Greeks seem in Scythic names to have changed into  ris  as Toxaris c But in fact the formal music of Greek composition forced their authors to change all bar∣baric names into a Greek form a circumstance which escaped M D'Anville but which over∣throws his argument which to say the best of it is a castle in the air of which such fluctuating mat∣ters as words and of them the most fluctuating names are formed A Frenchman calls London  Londres  where is the Gothic  dun  So puerile an argument deserves not confutation else by collecting all the Scythic and Gothic names i am con∣vinced it would be seen that many are similar to the German and Scandinavian and later Gothic  Thomyris  almost the first Scythic name in history probably belongs to the Gothic names beginning in  Tho  or  Theo  as Theodoric Theodahat c and ending in  ric  But names change thro length of time as lan∣guage always does even among barbarians and the names are so extremely various that hardly two similar can be found so that M D'A's argument is a mere sophism Verelius a better judge says the old Scythic names in Trogus and others are absolute Gothic  Praef ad Gethrici et Rolsi Hist Upsal    vo  Such is the case with foreign pronunciation among all nations But this is an age of etymological frenzy and we pay such attention to words that facts escape us No author before Cluverius ever dreamed that the Goths differed from the Getae Even in the darkest ages their identity was clearly seen The Goths in the year came from the very same ground where Strabo Pliny Ptolemy Dionysius the Geographer and all the writers from the first century down to that very time had placed the Getae The Romans before only knew the Getae by Greek report and gave them of course the Greek name in when they actually saw and fought with them they called them by their proper name Gothi as they studied not music nor accents in prose as the Greeks did but put the name as spoken only with a Latin termination  Dio who wrote about calls them still Getae as we have seen Succeeding writers expresly explain that the Getae and Gothi were the same as common sense might convince us for how could the prodigious nation of Getae so remark∣able in ancient authors vanish at once The Goths came from the very territory of the Getae and no authority would be required for any one of the smallest penetration to pronounce them the same people But in science it seems doubtful whether the most falsehood arises from the weak prejudices and caprice of the learned or from the superficiality of the ignorant Suffice it to say that AUTHORITIES ARE FACTS IN HISTORY and that any one of the above authorities would overturn any theory at once But where all the ancients agree in a point as they do in this for any modern to oppose his theoretic dreams is equally absurd as it would be to attempt to prove by modern arguments that all the Greek and Roman history is a fable  From these proofs therefore we must regard it as Historic Truth that the Getae and Goths were the same people  II  The Getae or Goths the same with the S  ythians  This will as plainly appear from the following evidences  Strabo Pliny Ptolemy all rank the Getae as Scythae  Justin or rather Trogus says Tanaus king of the most ancient  Scythae  fought with Vexores king of Egypt Valerius Flaccus lib V calls the same Tanaus king of the  Getae  Trebellius Pollio  in Gallieno Scythae autem id est pars Gothorum Asiam vastabant  The same  in Claudio Gothico Scytharum diversi populi Peu∣cini Trutungi  AUSTROGOTHI  praedae  c  Dexippus who as Grotius thinks wrote in the reign of Gallienus entitled his history of the wars between the Romans and Goths  or  Scythic Histories and called the Goths  Scythae  See Photius  Cod    Priscus uses  Scythians  and  Goths  synonymously saying 'they besieged the  Goths  There the  Scythians  labouring under want of victuals c'  In Excerpt Legat Valesii Paris to  Eunapius calls those  Goths  whom Valens planted in Maesia  Scythians  Ibid    Procopius  lib  IV  c    'all the other Gothic nations who were also called Scythians in ancient times'  Anastasius in Hist Chronograph    When many Scythians who are called Goths had past the river Ister in the time of Decius they wasted the Roman empire  Theophanes under the year    for that the Scythians are in their tongne called Goths Trajanus Patricius relates in the history of his own time  Georgius Syncellus    the Scythians are also called Goths in their own language  Jornandes  De rebus Get  et  De Regn Suce  always speaks of the Goths Getae and Scythae as one people and uses the names synonymously  Isidorus thus begins his Chronicle of the Goths in Spain  Gothorum antiquissimum esse regnum certum est quod ex regno Scytharum est exortum  procopius repeatedly calls the  Foederati  so well known in the Lower Empire  Goths  Suidas  in voce  calls them Scythae  Ammianus Marcellinus lib xxxi mentioning the death of Decius who fell in the battle against the Goths or Getae calls them  Scythicae gentes  There is not a shadow of any authority whatever on the other side of the question The dreams of Cluve∣rius and Grotius above mentioned only merit laugh∣ter as any modern must ever do who chuses to ad∣vance his futile speculations against ancient authority For as there can be no special revelation in such cases without the ancients we know nothing of the mat∣ter and if we strive to extinguish their lights must remain in utter darkness But if modern names may weigh Salmasius  de Lege Hellenist  p says  is but the same word differently pronounced Indeed the S in  Scythae  is but a servile letter as in many other Greek words where it is put or omitted at pleasure as  Skimbri  for  Kimbri  c  Steph Byz Aeschylus  in Persis  calls him  Merdis  whom Herodotus and Aristotle call  Smerdis  The Alpes Cottiae Pro∣copius styles  Lycophron v calls the Alps  See Bryant's Analysis vol III p  Wormius Ser Reg Dan produces these lines of an old Latin poem on Holgar king of Denmark in which  Gythi Gothi Gethae  are synonymous  Gytharum hic splendor Gothorum soboles  Armis est domitor Getha fidelis  This ancient name  Scythae  seems  Guthae  with an S prefixt and the G altered to K as no word in Greek begins with SG which is in∣deed almost unpronounceable in the beginning of a word but in SK or SC are many words in the Greek Mr Gibbon justly observes that the Greek writers after the appearance of the name  Gothi  among the Latin still use  Scythians  as a synonymous word This was owing to the Greeks retaining the name by which they had ever called them while the Romans to whom the people was un∣known save in ancient history and geography gave them on their first nearer acquantance with them not the Greek name but their own proper appellation It is also worth remarking that Odin was the great god of the Scandinavian Goths and the Icelandic Eddas and Sagas say that Odin led his people into Scandinavia from Scythia on the  Danastrom that is the Danaster Dniester or Tyras  These synonymous names  Scythae Getae Gothi  all appear sometimes in local sometimes in exten∣sive meaning among the ancients Herodotus puts the Getae on the south of the Danube and the Scythae on the other side Pliny and Strabo ex∣tend the Getae all over the west of the Euxine and the later thro half of Germany Herodotus  lib  IV  c  mentions the Thyssa Getae to the north of the Euxine and in the heart of Scythia and  lib  IV  c  the Massa Getae on the north and east of the Caspian Procopius  lib  I  c  says the whole Scythae were anciently called  Getic nations Jornandes uses the words  Scythae Getae Gothi  as quite synonymous Some as may be seen in the above authorities call the Getae or Gothi Scythians others call the Scythians Getae or Goths The words are absolutely synonymous nay to all appearance but one and the same name differently spelt  From these proofs it is Historic Truth that the Scy∣thians Getae Goths are one and the same people  CHAPTER II  Whether the Scythians or Goths proceeded from Scandinavia into Asia or from Asia into Europe  THIS is a most important and curious inquiry and for want of sufficient attention to it pro∣digious errors have crept into the works of almost all modern writers even of the highest account  It must here be premised that the term  Scythians  is often by modern writers used in a most lax and indefinite sense but is never so employed by the an∣cients whose ideas upon the subject were accurate and distinct Herodotus carefully distinguishes between the Scythians and the  Sarmatae  In book IV c he says that beyond the Tanais to the north 'are not Scythae but Sarmatae'  c  he mentions that the Melanchlaeni a Sarmatic nation are beyond the Scythae twenty days journey having said  c  that the Melanchlaeni are not Scythae and  lib  IV  c  he tells that some of the Sar∣matae were taught the SCYTHIC tongue by the Amazons He also distinguishes the Scythians from the  Celts  and places the later far to the west The  Tartars  were unknown to the ancients till the Fifth century when the Huns who were Tartars burst into Europe and Jornandes  De reb Get c  De Hunnorum execranda origine  Spe∣cies pavenda nigridine sed velut quaedam si dici fas est de∣formis offa non facies habensque magis puncta quam lu∣mina  c  sufficiently marks the great difference between the Scythians and the Huns as we can at this day by comparing the large shape blue eyes and fair hair of a German  with the small stature small black eyes and black hair of a Tartar These differences are found in the other ancient writers who fully knew that the Scythians were neither Sarmatae Celts nor Tar∣tars but a race of men peculiar fixt and distinct It is to modern ignorance or superficiality which is worse than ignorance that we are indebted for any confusion upon this matter There are how∣ever two exceptions to this general rule which as it is the intention of this treatise to lay every thing before the reader in the most open manner must not be forgotten The first is that of Strabo who in describing Asia  lib  XI  p  says  'On this side are the Sarmatae themselves Scythians' But this passage is a palpable mistake  Strabo lib vii p informs us that Ephorus called the Sarmatae a Scythic nation and he it was who misled Strabo Ephorus was an author of the most inaccurate and fabulous description and has misled Dionysius of Halicar∣nassus concerning the Pelasgi Sene  a Nat Quest vii fays  Ephorus non religiosissimae fidei saepe decipi    He seems to have gloried in contradicting Herodotus a writer whose information was wonderful and mostly derived from travel∣ling so that tho now and then fabulous in history every day gives fresh proofs of his veracity in describing countries and manners Herodotus had been in Scythia beyond the Danube and Borystenes Book iv c  and may be confuted from many others of Strabo himself who in describing Europe clearly and repeatedly distinguishes the Sarmatae from the Scythae Indeed the ignorance of Strabo concerning the Caspian sea and the nations to the east of it is well known Nor is it a wonder that he who supposed the Caspian a gulph of the Northern Ocean VII  p  from which it is near a thousand miles distant was so mistaken as to take the Asiatic Sarmatae for Scythae But this single passage of Strabo has no weight when all the other ancients from Herodotus down to Jornandes are clear and direct against it and prove it a mere error into which Ephorus led him The other exception is that of Procopius who says  'the Goths Vandals Visigoths and Gepidae were anciently called Sarmatae and Melanchlaeni some have also called them Getic nations  See the passage produced afterward  ' This can also be shewn a mistake of Procopius for the Melanchlaeni were a Sarmatic nation so called from their  black robes  and not to name all the ancients Jornandes a writer of his own time marks the Goths as warring with the Sarmatae and Hero∣dotus Strabo Mela Pliny Ptolemy with many others mark the Scythae or Goths as quite a distinct people from the Sarmatae The same Procopius with the ignorance of his benighted age says the Huns were anciently called Massagetae M  While the fact was that the Huns or Tartars had conquered the Massa∣getae a Scythic nation and seized their territories whence Procopius confounded the Huns who from that quarter poured into Europe with the Massa∣getae the ancient possessors  Still greater errors may be found in such late writers as to distant nations Agathias  lib  v says  the Burgundians a Hunnic nation  Herodotus Dio∣dorus Siculus Ptolemy and other ancients fully instruct us that the Massagetae were a Scythic nation and Diodorus says they were a colony of the Scythians on the Euxine These two are perhaps the only ancient writers who confound the Scythae with the Sarmatae or with the Tartars Not one of the ancients confounds the Scythae with the Celts Strabo's  CeltoScythae  were those Scythae who bordered on the Celts as the  IndoScythae  were those who bordered on the Indi  The reader to obtain a clear and precise view of our subject must bear in mind that there were in ancient Europe only four Grand Races of men namely  The  Celts  the most ancient inhabitants that can be traced and who were to the other races what the savages of America are to the European settlers there  The  Iberi  of Spain and Aquita∣nia  who were Mauri and had past from Africa These Two Races were few in number the Celts being mostly destroyed by the Sarmatae and Scythae and few of the Iberi having come into Europe  The  Sarmatae  who were in all ap∣pearance originally possessors of southwest Tartary but expelled by the Tartars For their speech the Sarmatic or Slavonic is remote from the Tartaric and their persons full of grace and majesty are dif∣ferent from those of Tartars so that they are not of Tartaric origin  The  Scythians  who originated as shall presently be seen from present Persia and spred from thence to the Euxine and almost over all Europe  In the ancient authors these grand races of men are marked and clear and that chief distinction of the four languages still remains to certify them The Celtic is spoken by the Irish and Welch The Iberian still partly survives in the Gascunian or Basque and Mauritanic The Sarmatic is the vast Slavonic tongue The Scythic comprehends the other nations but especially the Germans and Scandinavians whose speech is less mixt No di∣visions can be more accurate and precise from present proofs as well as from ancient writers It is to modern authors and some of them illustrious that we owe any confusion upon this subject aris∣ing from a very simple cause to wit that good authors are rarely antiquaries and that men of great talents are seldom so industrious as to go to the bottom of a subject where alone however the truth is to be found Thus we find one modern writer  Pelloutier  gravely pronouncing that the Scythians were  Celts  because he was a Frenchman and wanted to make France the parent of all nations which he easily proves for he was enabled to shew from all the ancients that the Greeks Italians Germans c c were infallibly of Scythic origin  and as he says the Scythians were Celts it fol∣lowed that all the nations of Europe were Celtic Unhappily he forgot that the antients distinguish more widely between the Scythians and Celts than between any other Grand Races of men for from the days of Herodotus to the latest voice of anti∣quity the Scythians are marked as proceeding from Asia and the Celts as confined to the utmost west of Europe Nor can any tongues be of more different form than the Celtic and Gothic Thus we find another  Macpherson  telling us upon  his own  authority that the Goths were Sarmatae without once re∣flecting that all the antients are direct against him and that a nation speaking the Gothic tongue can no more be the same with one speaking the Slavonic than a Swede can be a Russian Thus we find others  Gibbon Richardson c c  calling the Scythae Tartars and the Tartars Scythae forgetting that the ancients did not even know the existence of the Tartars till the Huns appeared and that they distinguish the Scy∣thae from the Huns in the most positive manner forgetting that the Scythae spoke the Gothic tongue a language as remote from the Tartaric as possible  Ihre a man of industry and skill in the Gothic but of small learning and still less penetration in the preface to his SuioGothic Glossary observes the danger of attempting to trace Scythic words given us by ancient writers in the Gothic because says he it appears that the Scythians had anciently different tongues For Herodotus says that in Scy∣thia were Seven languages Strabo  lib  X  p  says the Alani a Scythic nation had twentysix languages Mithridates king of Pontus we are told learned Twentytwo tongues to converse with his own subjects who were chiefly Scythic or at least in the old seats of the Scythae Lucian says Tiri∣dates a successor of Mithridates in those parts  requested a Pantomimus from Nero as a general interpreter of gestures to his subjects not being able to understand so many tongues The Scho∣liast of Apollonius Rhodius IV says there were Fifty Scythian nations Ihre remarks justly that the ancients comprized all the nations in the oblique ascent from the Caspian sea up to the far∣thest point of Scandinavia under the general name of Scythians and let me add for a good reason because they were so all save the Sarmatians whom some ancient writers only called Scythae before it was fully discovered that the Sarmatae were of quite a distinct race and language as known in the time of Tacitus and Ptolemy Let me observe upon this that the whole is a superficial misrepresentation Herodotus does not say that there were seven languages in Scythia but that there was one Scy∣thic nation the Argippae called also Phalacri or Bald Scythians who lived at a vast distance  to the east  Lib iv c  He observes there was a number of countries and regions be∣tween them and the others and adds 'the Scythae who go to them pass by seven interpreters and as many tongues' Herodotus is on the contrary a clear witness that the Scythae had but one speech for  lib  IV  c  he tells that some of the Sarma∣tae learned the SCYTHIC tongue  from the Amazons He also repeatedly tells us that the Scythians denominate such a person or thing by such a name in THEIR language  iv  c  Strabo's testimony concerning the Alani a small nation of the Scythae having twentysix languages is mat∣ter of laughter not of authority being only likely to be true when the Caspian sea was a gulf of the Northern Ocean as Strabo tells and akin to the men with dogs heads or horses feet and other impossible fictions of travellers which imposed on grave authors of antiquity If Mithridates learned  Twentytwo tongues it was not to converse with his subjects but from his love of learning and the number is no doubt vastly magnified as usual in such cases Lucian's tale is a risible and good one but did Ihre think it a matter of fact That the Alani as a scattered nation bordering on the Sar∣matae and on the Tartars had many dialects we may well believe So we may that in the kingdom of Pontus comprizing Galatae or German Gauls Asiatic Scythians Syrians of Cappadocia Sarma∣tians Colchians Chaldaei Greeks there were three radical languages the Scythian Sarmatic and Assyrian which might well ferment into many dialects The Scholiast of Apollonius says nothing of languages but only shews the vast extent of the Scythae  This point required attention because a diversity of tongues would have argued the term  Scythoe  an indefinite appellation and it is believed the reader will now see that there is no authority whatever for such an idea That some Scythic words mentioned by the ancients should not now be found in Gothic is less surprizing than that several should of which instances may be found in Ihre Sheringham and others Languages change by time many words drop into desuetude and others supply their place He must be a sanguine antiquary indeed who would expect to find every Scythic word in the remains of the Gothic which we have It may therefore be reasonably concluded that as the Scythae are a most marked and distinct people in ancient accounts so they had but one general speech the Scythic or Gothic tho perhaps divided into dialects as dif∣ferent as the English and German are now  Let us now proceed to that important question Whether the Scythians came originally from Scan∣dinavia into Asia or from Asia into Europe    That the Scythians originated from Scandinavia  we have  one  authority that of Jornandes who wrote about the year Jornandes was himself a  Goth  He was an  Alanus  Ihre praef ad Gloss SuioGoth  but is thought only the abridger of a large history of the Goths by Cassiodorus who was his cotemporary If this was the case the abridgment must be inaccurate being solely from memory after a reading of three days  Sed ut non mentiar ad triduanam lectionem dispensa∣toris ejus beneficio libros ipsos antehac relegi quorum quamvis verba non recolo sensum tamen et res actas credo me integre tenere ad quas nonnulla ex historicis Graecis et Latinis addidi convenientia initium finemque et plura in medio  mea  dictione permiscens  Praef  For the settlement of the Scythae on the Euxine he quotes old songs and Ablavius who is thought by Grotius to have written under Constan∣tius II and was certainly a late author For the Scythae coming from Scandinavia he cites no authority and it was apparently put  mea dictione  that is upon his own dreams Bayer in  Dissert de Cimmeriis  has ridiculed this mook emigra∣tion of the Goths from Scandinavia and justly asks how Ab∣lavius or Jornandes could know any thing of the matter  But it appears from the words of Jornandes underquoted that he fol∣lowed Cassiodorus but added some things from Greek and Roman writers However this be Jor∣nandes puts Scandinavia as the ancient Scythia from which the Scythians afterward called Goths came for he rightly thro his whole work uses  Scythae Getae  and  Gothi  as synonymous words He makes them pour from Scandinavia down to the Euxine thence into Asia which they subdue down to Egypt where they conquer Vexores as an∣tient writers say the Scythae did about years before Christ He then gives the history of the Amazons or Scythian female warriors a fable in all probability grounded on real history and arising from two sources  That the Scythian women often fought along with their husbands  That the name of a Scythian nation  Amazons  unhappily signified in Greek  without breasts  After this we find some account of the learning of the Scythians or Goths their manners c and he next passes to Maximin the emperor who was a Thracian  Goth the irruption of the Goths in the time of Decius c c  Such is the line which Jornandes persues and his account of the origin of the Scythae was blindly followed by Isidorus by Beda who calls Scandina∣via Scythia by Paulus Diaconus by the geogra∣pher of Ravenna and by innumerable others in the dark ages Nay such an effect may even a very weak writer for such Jornandes is have upon literature that one sentence of Jornandes has over∣turned the very basis of the history of Europe This famous sentence is in his fourth chapter  Ex hac igitur Scandia insula quasi  OFFICINA GEN∣TIUM  aut certe velut  VAGINA NATIONUM  cum rege suo nomine Berig Gothi quondam memorantur egressi  Upon this one sentence have all modern historians nay such writers as Montesquieu Gib∣bon and others of the first name built Now it can clearly be shewn that Scandinavia was down to a late period nay is at present almost overrun with enormous forests where there was no room for population Adam of Bremen  Adam Bremen Hist Eccles cap De Situ Daniae  who wrote in the Eleventh century instructs us that even in Denmark at that time the sea coasts alone were peopled while the inner parts of the country were one vast forest If such was the case in Den∣mark we may guess that in Scandinavia even the shores were hardly peopled Scandinavia is also a most mountainous region and among a barbaric and unindustrious people the mountains are almost unpeopled In fact the sole colonies that ever went from Scandinavia were the Piks  The name is thus spelt to avoid the double meaning of the word  Picti  or  Picts  as we translate it and in conformity with the origin of the people who were Piki or Peukeni see Part II and the name of their country in Norway which in the Scandinavian and Icelandic histories c is called  Pika  pronounced and spelt  Vika  for they have no P and pronounce P as V But of this in Part II and in the  Enquiry into Scotish History  into Scotland  the opposite shore the Danes into Denmark and at the late period the Normans into France and a few small colonies into Iceland and the neighbour∣ing iles  But to discredit for ever this dream of Jornandes who is in fact the sole authority on that side of the question for other writers down to our times tho they might be reckoned by hundreds all stand upon his foundation alone let us proceed to evince beyond a doubt that the Scythians came from Asia and that of course Scandinavia must have been al∣most the last point of their population instead of the first or  punctum saliens  II  That the Scythians originated from Asia  can be proved by many authorities even the least of them superior to that of Jornandes  Trogus Pompeius in the reign of Augustus with sedulous diligence and great ability compiled an universal history afterward in the reign of Antoninus Pius abstracted by Justin who dedicates his work to that prince From Trogus Justin  Hist lib I c lib II c  tells us that the Scythians contended with the Egyptians then esteemed the earliest of nations for antiquity and that Asia was conquered by them and tributary to them for no less a space than Fifteen Hundred years before Ninus founder of the Assyrian Empire put an end to the tribute  The ideas of the ancients concerning this first Supreme Empire were as might be expected very confused Trogus and Justin say the Scythians conquered Vexores king of Egypt fifteen hundred years before the time of Ninus Isaac Vossius in his notes on Justin wonders that Trogus should say the Scythians conquered Sesostris while Hero∣dotus Dicaearchus Diodorus Siculus and others say that Sesostris vanquished the Scythae Vossius did not see that Sesostris was out of all question and that it is Vexores whom Justin bears as dif∣ferent  a name and person from Sesostris as can well be imagined Vexores lived about years before Christ Sesostris about But Vossius is not the only learned man who from want of common discernment has even confounded this First Scythic Empire with an eruption of the Scythae into Asia about years after Ninus while the Great Scythic Empire was terminated by Ninus after lasting more than years In the works of the Lipsii Scaligeri Salmasii Vossii Grotii one finds every thing but common sense without which every thing is less than nothing Trogus who was in civil history what Pliny was in natural history an indefatigable compiler of the whole knowlege that could be found in preceding authors discovered this earliest empire as Time draws truth out of the well The war of Sesostris against the Scythae about years before Christ narrated by Hero∣dotus and Diodorus Siculus must by no means be confounded with events that happened years before Ninus as Justin states or years before Christ From Justin it is apparent that the Scythians fixt and resident in present Persia per∣haps years before Ninus carried on a war against Vexores years before the time of Ni∣nus and subduing the west of Asia made it tri∣butary till Ninus delivered it by establishing the Assyrian Empire on the ruins of the Scythian  In fact we have good authorities  Strabo may also be adduced who lib xi p says "neither the ancient affairs of the Persians Medes Syrians nor Scythians have much credit in history" The enumera∣tion of empires is here palpably retrograde the most modern being put first  to compare with Trogus and to confirm that the First Grand Scythian Empire was in present Persia For that most learned Father of the Church Epiphanius in his work against Heresies near the beginning divides religious error into four great periods  Barba∣rism  Scythism  Hellenism or Grecian  error  Judaism He also says the Scythians were of those who built the tower of Babel and his Scythism extends from the flood to this later event  Eusebius in his Chronicle p puts the Scy∣thians as the immediate descendants of Noah down to Serug his seventh descendant that is a space of about years as generations are computed at that period of longevity This was the Scythian age the most ancient after the flood the Scythism of Epiphanius for his barbarism was the period pre∣ceding the flood Eusebius also says  'from the deluge to the building of the tower of Babel Scythism pre∣vailed'  The Chronicon Paschale p makes Barba∣rism precede the deluge then Scythism Helle∣nism Judaism as Epiphanius  Perhaps it may be thought that these ecclesiastic authorities prove too much as they mark the whole immediate descendents of Noah as Scythians and of course might prove all the nations of the globe Scythians as by Scripture account they all sprung from Noah But it is the line of Shem down to Serug and not of Ham or Japhet who are marked as Scythians and Shem was reputed the father of Asia as Ham of Africa and Japhet of Europe The flood is now generally reputed a local event but accept these authorities any way and they shew that the Scythians originated in Asia The coin∣cidence of these writers with Trogus is fixt and strong Ninus is reputed the founder of the tower of Babel which was followed by the dispersion of mankind He was the founder of the Assyrian em∣pire whose capital was Babylon and the dispersion of the Scythians followed Of the race of Ham by scripture account was Nimrod thought Ninus and Ashur thought father of the Assyrians to which race also belong the fathers of nations along the east end of the Mediterranean the Arabic gulf of Red  sea and thro all Arabia Certain it is that the Arabic is a dialect of the Grand Assyrian language as are the Syrian Phoenician Hebrew Chaldee Coptic Abyssinian c all sister dialects and the Assyrians who overturned the Scythian empire formed one great language or race of men extend∣ing along the east end of the Mediterranean and Arabian seas to the Erythraean sea gulf of Per∣sia and river Euphrates From them the Egyp∣tians and White Ethiopians must also have sprung as their language and situation declare  From these smaller lights compared with Tro∣gus or Justin it will appear as evident as so very remote an event can well be that the Scythian Empire was the first of which any memory has reached us And it is a plausible opinion adopted by late mythologists that Saturn Jupiter Bac∣chus c were monarchs of this first empire whose glorious actions procured them divine honours from their subjects after their death This empire was perfectly barbarie and the seat of war not of arts All nations save the Egyptians were then pastoral and the Scythians as described by Hero∣dotus on the Euxine were certainly more advanced in society than when holding the empire of Asia for agriculture was then known to one or two na∣tions of them  Horace describes them as Tacitus does the Germans  Campestres melius Scythae  Quorum plaustra vagas rite trahunt domos  Vivunt et rigidi Getae  Immetata quibus jugera liberas  Fruges et Cererem ferunt  Nec cultura placet longior annua  Ode  lib III  which there is no room to think they knew at all in their first empire This wan∣dering state of pastoral society will at once account for so many of the Scythae leaving their domi∣nions on the Assyrian conquest that eastern tra∣dition reported the dispersion of men to have followed that event But no doubt vast numbers still remained in Persia and submitted to their new lords Herodotus Diodorus only mention  the Scythae  Nomades  of the north of Persia to have past the Araxes and the Scythae in the south remained and were ever known by the name of Persians as at this day  It may be asked how the memory of this vast empire escaped Herodotus and yet was preserved by later writers But we must reflect that it is always time that discovers the truth that Hero∣dotus might not be versed in the eastern languages or history and that Homer himself says not a word of Ninus Babylon or the Assyrian empire nor of the Median Many of the most important facts in ancient history were recovered after the time of Herodotus by writers who lived in the countries where they happened Nor let it be imagined that what Herodotus says  lib  IV  c  with regard to the Scythians their boasting of be∣ing the newest of nations and not existing above a thousand years before Darius son of Hystaspes be considered as evidence against the existence of the Scythian empire For not to mention the wellknown fabulous disposition of Herodotus whose work has been rightly called the shade be∣tween poetry and history and who from his love of the marvellous and new might ascribe this idea to the Scythians we may well reconcile his authority with that of other ancients by saying that the Scythians tho the most ancient people of which history preserves remembrance were yet new in the seats they held in the time of Herodotus who speaks especially of the Scythae on the west of the Euxine Because after being expelled by Ninus some centuries must have past before they came to the west of the Euxine and down to the Danube where Herodotus finds the Scythae he dwelt on and between Ninus and Darius about years occur  Herodotus himself is a sufficient witness that the Scythians did not originate from Scandinavia but from present Persia For he tells us book IV  ch that they passed the Araxes and entered the Bosphorus Cimmerius The Araxes it is well known is a large river of Armenia running into the Caspian sea Herodotus IV men∣tions 'the Caspian sea and the Araxes running to the east' Hence it is clear that even by the account of Herodotus himself the Scythians passed up from Persia to the Euxine He there∣fore affords a collateral proof of the existence of the first Scythian empire by making his later Scythians ascend from the country where other ancients place it and at the same time is an abso∣lute witness that the Scythae could not come from Scandinavia seeing their course was in direct op∣position proceeding from the southeast to the northwest instead of the contrary  Diodorus Siculus confirms the account of He∣rodotus telling us  lib  II  p  that the Scythian Nomades were at first a small nation on the Araxes whence they spred to Caucasus and the Palus Maeotis He also greatly strengthens the narra∣tive of Trogus tho he confounds the first em∣pire of the Scythae with their later invasion and ascribes to this late invasion a protracted empire and many great kings in which he contradicts the best and earliest writers And had not Justin Epiphanius Eusebius and the Chronicon Pas∣chale remained we might to this hour confound two vast events the invasion of Egypt by the Scythae from their original seats years before Christ and their later invasion years before Christ so uncertain is traditional chronology  As brevity is much studied in this dissertation and every reader will at once allow any one of the above authorities sufficient to overturn that of Jornandes i shall not insist further but sum up this article by observing  That we have suffi∣cient authorities direct and collateral for the Scythian empire in present Persia being the first  in the world the Assyrian generally reputed the first only succeeding it And it is believed no man will be so much the dupe of hypothesis as to suppose that the Scythians ascended from Scandinavia and dropped down in the plains of Babylon or in opposition to Epiphanius Eusebius and the Chronicon Paschale to assert that even those first Scythae were of Scandinavia or in other words that Noah and the first reputed inhabitants of the earth came from Scandinavia  That Herodotus Diodorus and indeed all writers who have occasion to mention the subject down to the Sixth century when Jornandes the first monastic historian wrote and darkness error and ignorance surrounded the world are in direct opposition to Jornandes These early writers of enlightened times uniformly make the Scythae pass from the south of Asia up in a North West direc∣tion till they spred over all Europe and to op∣pose the single testimony of Jornandes to such au∣thorities would be absurd beyond all absurdity Gro∣tius who maintains it from a silly wish of honour∣ing Sweden has been forced totally to garble and alter it by bringing those Goths from Scandinavia about years before Christ whom Jornandes brings thence about years before Christ But this hypothesis is contradictory to all ancient ac∣counts as has been and shall be shewn in the course of this tract and deserves laughter not re∣futation Grotius is no authority at all it is Jor∣nandes who from his antiquity merits confutation from other authors yet more ancient and far better informed Indeed simply to ask by what special miracle Jornandes discovered a matter not only unknown to but contradictory of all the ancients would be full confutation in such a case He lived in no Augustan age when science was at its height but in all the darkness of ignorance and would not have even merited confutation had he not misled so many  It is therefore Historic Truth that the Scythians otherwise called Goths came from present Persia into Europe by a North West progress and that Scan∣dinavia instead of being the country whence they sprung must in fact have been almost the last that re∣ceived them  CHAPTER III  The real origin and first progress of the Scythians or Goths and their Eastern Settlements  WE have already seen that the Scythian Empire in present Persia is the most ancient of which history has preserved any memo∣rial This very curious subject shall not be here enlarged on but is left to some future Historian of the Scythians This empire seems to have extended from Egypt to the Ganges and from the Persian gulf and Indian sea to the Caspian The conquests of Bacchus reputed a king of this Scythian dominion in India are famous in an∣tiquity he introduced the vine or the use of wine into his dominions and was deified as the god of wine by his subjects The bacchanalian feasts of the Thracians and other Scythae are noted by classic authors and from the Thracians they are mentioned to have past to the Greeks The wine of barley ale supplied the want of the grape and Bacchus retained his honours But to enter more certain ground the real Scythians of this original empire seem to have been bounded by the Euphrates on the west and the Indus on the east The Arabians Syrians c were cer∣tainly not Scythae We find IndoScythae on the Indus and other remains on the Erythraean sea but none beyond the IndoScythae On the north the original Scythae extended to the Caspian Due klowledge of this empire would remove those em∣barrassments  which the learned have fallen into from ancient accounts of the wars between the Scy∣thae and Egyptians while Scythia on the Euxine is so remote from Egypt Most of the ancient authors only knowing Scythia on the Euxine as the early seat of the Scythae have misrepresented some of those wars as carried on at such prodigious distance while the first Scythian empire really bordered on the Egyptian kingdom  It has been shewn above that ecclesiastic authors of chief account even regarded the Scythians as the very first inhabitants of the east after the deluge If any reader inclines to look upon the deluge as fabulous  The latest and best Natural Philosophers pronounce the flood impossible and their reasons grounded on mathemati∣cal truth and the immutable laws of nature have my full assent The Jews believed the earth a vast plain and that the rain came from a collection of waters  above  the firmament  Genes  I as the earth floated on another mass of waters  Gen  VII both of which were opened at the deluge As such waters are now mathematically known not to exist and the earth is found spherical the effect must cease with the cause M de Buffon has shewn that all the earth was at first under sea And the opinion of a deluge which Grotius  De Verit Rel Christ  shews to have been common to most nations certainly arose from the shells found even on the tops of mountains  or as at most a local event and desires to learn whence the Scythians came to present Persia he need not be told that it is impossible to answer him With their residence in Persia com∣mences the faintest dawn of history beyond altho the period may amount to myriads of ages there is nothing but profound darkness It is a selfevident proposition that the author of nature as he formed great varieties in the same species of plants and of animals so he also gave various races of men as inhabitants of several countries A Tartar a Negro an American c c differ as much from a German as a bulldog or lapdog or shepherdd's cur from a pointer The differences are radical and such as no climate or chance could  produce and it may be expected that as science advances able writers will give us a complete system of the many different races of men  The First Progress of the Scythians was as above shewn from Herodotus Diodorus Siculus and other ancients out of the north of present Persia over the river Araxes and the vast moun∣tains of Caucasus which run between the Euxine and Caspian seas And their first grand settlement after this emigration was upon the east north and west of the Euxine in the tract described as Ancient Scythia by Herodotus and many others and which including the northern half of the Euxine formed as Herodotus represents almost a square A part of the Cimmerii or ancient Celtic inhabitants of all Germany and up to the Euxine naturally fortified in a corner of the Tauric Chersonese by surrounding waters long withstood the Scythians or were neglected by them and were not expelled till about years before Christ when passing the Cimmerian Bosphorus they made their way into Asia over the mountains of Caucasus The Scythians pursued them and again conquered great part of Asia but retained it only for about thirty years  Herodot lib I and IV Diod Sic lib II c It is remarkable that the small kingdom of the  Bosphorus  long main∣tained itself in the same natural fortification See a map of the Bosphorus Cimmerius in Peysonel  This later expedition some ancients have confounded with the first Scythic empire  But if we except this small corner of the Tauric Chersonese the Scythians may be regarded as possest of all ancient Scythia at least two thousand years before Christ Expelled from northern Per∣sia by Ninus about years before our aera they could not take more than two centuries to cover ancient Scythia if their numbers did not fill it at first This will further appear from the progress  of the Scythae detailed in the rest of this disser∣tation  From Scythia on the Euxine which with the antients let us call Antient Scythia as being the Parent Country of the European Scythians the Scythae gradually extended to the East around the northern shores of the Caspian Dionysius the geographer v and other ancients instruct us that the regions between the Euxine and Caspian were all peopled by Scythae  Pontus  Colchis received a colony of Egyptians about years before Christ and Herodotus tells us that the speech and manners of the Colchians were Egyptian The gold mines of Colchis no doubt attracted the Egyptians as they had done the Argonauts They are still very rich See Peysonel p    Armenia Iberia Albania  were of the Scythic set∣tlements The Iberi here had as plain sense might dictate nothing in common with the Iberi of Spain but the name tho Strabo i xv says they came from Spain and Abydenus  Apud Euseb preap Evang lib ix c  fabled that Nebuchadnezzar having subdued Afric and Spain brought these Iberi from Spain Appian  In Ibericis  i e  Hispanicis  init  tells us in direct terms that their language man∣ners c were totally different They had in∣deed no more connection than the Albani here with the  Albanique patres et altae moenia Romae  with Albania the mountainous western part of Macedon or with the Albani or Highlanders of Scotland Such coinciding names are mere falls of letters and he who builds any hypothesis on them as M de Buat and others have done should be taught to study the etymology of Hellebore But etymology and single words and names have converted the literature of the eighteenth century into a tissue of visions and we daily see history built upon what no man of sound mind would even  build a fable Solinus c says the Albani of Asiatic Scythia have white hair blue eyes and see better by night than by day See also Pliny VII Aul Gell ix Between the mouths of the Tanais and Rha were the  Alani  a Scythic people cele∣brated in the  Alanica  of Arrian and  Toxaris  of Lucian who were generally leagued with the Ostrogoths and in time came to have settlements in Gaul and Spain On the north of the Caspian as appears from Herodotus who did not like Strabo take the Caspian for a gulf of the Northern Ocean were the MASSAGETAE a great and renowned na∣tion whose queen Thomyris slew Cyrus and de∣stroyed his army The Massagetae extended to the east of the Caspian and they and the SACAE were the  Scythae Intra Imaum  which Ptolemy begins from the Rha or Wolga on the west as the  Chatae  and fabulous  Arimaspi  belonged to  Scy∣thia extra Imaum  which Ptolemy marks as a very narrow tract and it certainly did not reach above two hundred miles to the east of the Caspian We learn from Diodorus Siculus  lib  ii  c  that the Scythians coming over the Araxes and moun∣tains of Caucasus to the Palus Maeotis from thence after some time extended their conquests and settlements beyond the Tanais and that from them the Massagetae Sacae Arimaspi and several other nations sprung The  Bactriani  Justin says were Scythae  Lib II c he adds the Parthi but that the Par∣thians were Sarmatae is clear from the other ancients and especially from their long and loose dress mentioned by Ta∣citus Herodian c The Sarmatae had indeed been called Scythae by some of the ancients That the Medes were Sar∣matae we know positively from Solinus but some others have foolishly called the Sarmatae Medes as if a large barbaric na∣tion could spring from a small refined one  That the  Sogdiani  between the Massagetae to the north and Bactriani to the South were Scythae is clear from Strabo and the description of their manners given us by Curtius  lib  vii  c  Strabo XI says the Bactriani were Sacae and it would seem that the Sogdiani also were Sacae was indeed a general name given to the Scythae by the Persians as Herodotus tells The Bactriani were old Scythae who extended so far during the Scythic Empire in Persia for Ninus made war on them  Diodor  ii  Justin  i The Alani who bordered on the Massagetae on the west are also called Massagetae by one or two late Latin writers The  Hyrcani  were also Scythae and the  Dahae  Steph Byz and Pliny IV The  Margiani  were of the Massagetae as Ptolemy shews who places Massa∣getae in Margiana and Dionysius the geogra∣pher v and Eratostenes in Strabo  lib  ii extend some Massagetae into Bactriana Indeed Strabo mentions that SACAE and MASSAGETAE were general names for the Asiatic Scythae on the east of the Caspian and Herodotus and Pliny say that the Persians called those Scythae by the general name of Sacae The Sacae also made later incursions into Hyrcania and so far as Ar∣menia where Sacapene a district was called by their name Ptolemy Strabo  lib  ii  Sacae  and  Massagetae  among the Persians seem equivalent to  Scythae  and  Getae  among the Greeks A region at the fountains of Oxus and Jaxartes is still called  Sakita  from the Sacae and the Scythia  extra Imaum  was called  Gete  and it's people  Getes  in the time of Tamerlane as appears from his life written in Persian See M de Anville's Memoir on the Getae in those of the Academy  Tome  XXV and on the mountains of God and Magog which to me seem those of Imaus  Tome  XXXII  My purpose forbids my dwelling on these eastern Scythae The ancient and modern Persians certainly were and are Scythae who remained in the southern parts when the Scythae Nomades of the north passed the Araxes to enjoy that freedom in other regions which they could not retain under  the Assyrian power for northern nations have al∣ways been fond of liberty while the southern pre∣ferred the delights and ease of their climate The Assyrian empire followed the Scythian years before Christ the Median succeeded to the Assyrian years before Christ the Persian commenced years before our aera The Par∣thian kingdom began years before Christ Ardshir or Artaxerxes restored the Persian years after Christ which lasted till the invasion of the Arabs in the Persian line was restored in the Tenth century but the people remained and remain much the same The Persians who re∣founded the empire years before our aera seem to have been the old Scythae of Persia strengthened by accessions of the IndoScythae and from the Scythian territories on the east of the Caspian  Persae qui sunt originitus Scythae  Ammian Marcellin  lib xxxi and Tertullian  de Pallio  c The present Persian tho mixt with some Arabic is actually a dialect of the Go∣thic as Scaliger Lipsius Boxhorn and our Burton whose book was reprinted at Lubec have shewn It has auxiliary verbs and other radical marks of its Gothic origin unknown to other Eastern tongues besides a verbage mostly Gothic the  Farsi  is meant the  Pehlavi  which was spoken in Media and Parthia was surely Sarmatic but has been long since discouraged and lost See Richard∣son's Dissertation prefixed to his Persian and Arabic Dictio∣nary who however as well as the most learned Jones for∣gets the similarity of the Persian and Gothie  The Assyrians formed one great language or race of men as above mentioned The Medes we know from Herodotus Diodorus Siculus Strabo Solinus and others were Sarma∣tae who had pierced thro the Scythians and passed the Caucasus by the Sarmaticae Pylae into Media The Parthians were also Sarmatae as appears from Tacitus  Veste destinguuntur non fluitante  sicut Sarmatae ac Parthi  Tac in Germania The Persian  braccae  or  breeches  are men∣tioned by Ovid  in Trist  those of the Sacae by Herod lib vii  and others They had followed the same tract with the Medes easily making way thro  the Alani and other Scythic nations who were scattered around the mountains of Caucasus  Procopius who wrote about is so ignorant as above shewn as to call the Massagetae Huns be∣cause the Huns had seized on the lands of the Mas∣sagetae and from that quarter poured into the em∣pire But when Herodotus wrote and down to the Christian aera as is clear from M de Guignes the Huns were on the north of China When they appeared in the west Jornandes well marks the prodigious difference between them and the Scythae the same as that between a German and a Tartar The famous SCYTHIA INTRA ET EXTRA IMAUM was if compared to Tartary as a drop in the ocean Geographers preceding this century not knowing the shape of the Caspian have erred prodigiously but none more than Cluverius a most inaccurate writer Ptolemy's longitudes of Asia now proved to be false to excess have also misled M D'Anville shews that the mouth of the Ganges placed by Ptolemy in degrees has by actual observation been found to have but Another place he gives  o  which really bears  o  an error of fiftynine degrees or about miles Strahlenberg observes that Ptolemy gives a place in the extremity of Serica a latitude extending to the borders of China which in fact is but a hundred and twenty miles east of the Cas∣pian sea Ptolemy's Seres which he places be∣yond  Scythia extra Imaum  were in the east of present Bucharia  The SERES were a Grand Race of men now those of Tibett Siam c using a peculiar language Ptolemy's Serica is as large as both Scythias  intra et extra Imaum  See a description of Bucharia in that interesting work which opens as it were a new world to our eyes  Russia  by Mr Tooke vols  vo  London  It is remarkable that in Scythia  intra et extra Imaum  were  Chatae  Catti  Sasones  Saxones  Syebi  Suevi  Tectosaces  Tecto∣fages  Iotae  Iutes a town  Menapia  all coinciding with Ger∣man names and which could only spring from identic lan∣guage But nothing is founded on this  These inland parts were  totally unknown to the ancients while from the merchants they knew the coasts to Cochin China which M D'Anville  Mem de l'Acad des Inscr Tome xxxii  shews to be the seat of the ancient Sinae We know little about them even at present tho much indebted to Strahlenberg's map  In his description of Siberia a prolix and weak work of which a translation appeared at London  to  and other works of this century The Tar∣tars were absolutely unknown to the ancients till the Huns appeared and they express the greatest surprize at such new features of human nature The Scythians were neither Tartars nor of Tar∣taric origin as some late writers imagine who astonished at the vast extent of Tartary and for∣getting how thinly that extent is peopled make Tartary the storehouse of nations as if the author of nature had peopled the world from the most desert part of it Even the Chinese and Japanese are not Tartars as their language and history de∣clare the former are infallibly a Grand Aboriginal nation and the later a colony of them  M de Guignes attempts to shew  Mem des Inser  Tome xxix that the Chinese are an Egyptian colony It seems certain that the old Egyptian letters and the Chinese are of the same innumerable kind and originally hieroglyphic But we are not to believe that what one nation has invented may not be invented by another in a similar state of society and no two countries can have more resemblance as to agriculture c than those of the old Egyptians and the Chinese But their languages and features shew them quite distinct nations not to mention their religious opinions buildings c  The East Indians are not Tartars but a race and language of men by themselves The Persians are another The Arabs another The Turks are a mixture of a few Tartars with numbers of Arabs Greeks Syrians c Some writers observe a difference between the Southern and Northern Tartars This rises solely from the former re∣maining unmixed while the later are intermingled with the inhabitants of all the kingdoms they con∣quered  For in agricultural and industrious regions the lords change but the inhabitants remain The Chinese are the same people tho often subdued and ruled by Tartars and in all the above Scy∣thic settlements as the Huns came not in upon them till the fourth century there is every reason to conclude that the inhabitants then far advanced in society remained in their possessions The Goths who came into the Roman empire are counted by thousands those who remained may be reckoned by millions The Ostrogoths and Alani in particular formed a league with the Huns and joined them in arms and their territories certainly remained unmolested Busbequius and others shew that the peasants of Crim Tartary still speak the Gothic  CHAPTER IV  The Western Settlements of the Scythians or Goths between the Euxine and Mediterranean seas  FROM their settlements on the Euxine the Scythians Getae or Goths gradually extended over most of Europe and the Greeks and Romans were as shall be presently shewn certainly Scy∣thians tho refined by adventitious circumstances The station whence the innumerable and vast Scythic swarms advanced is now Little Tartary formerly called Ancient or Little Scythia  See a description and maps of this fertile and populous country in Peysonnel In the Lower Empire there was an  Episcopus Scythiae  and an  Episcopus Gothiae  the former was of Scythia Pontica whose capital was Tomi the latter seems to have been of Crim Tartary See Chrysost  Epist    ad Olympiad  Orosius says  Alania est in medio Dacia ubi et Gothia deinde Germania  lib  I c so also AEthi∣cus Ammian Marc  lib    metus totius Gothiae Thracias perrumpentis  in all which passages Gothia is Getia When Rubruquis was sent to the Chan of the Mogols by St Louis and traversed Crim Tartary

Gothiae et Caphae  Caffa is in the Crimea which was long held by the Genoese  Crim  is  Cim∣merius  shortened the town  Cimmerium  is called  Eski Crim  or Old Crim by the Tartars  It's  maritime situation encircling the sea had no doubt advantages as to population For it is well known that sea coasts teem with progeny owing to the inhabitants living on fish a food at once salacious and prolific whence they who love to moralize ancient fables may well illustrate the birth of Venus herself from the sea The Greeks accustomed to a hot climate regarded Ancient Scythia as very cold for such ideas are comparative an African regarding Italy as cold an Italian France a Frenchman Britain a Briton Iceland But plain reason dictates that this country from it's situation must be blest with a temperate cli∣mate and it's amazing vegetation at present de∣clares this Countries beyond the Sixtieth degree of latitude in any part of the globe are almost desert nor can population thrive in such extreme cold Ancient Scythia lying between the For∣tieth and Fiftieth degree is in that happy tem∣perature between heat and cold where philosophy and actual observation evince that population is greatest Poland a country bordering on Ancient Scythia is the most populous in Europe for it's size and were it not for a tyrannic government and total depression of the people would be twice as populous Far the greatest part of Scandinavia lies beyond the Sixtieth degree and is from real and not comparative cold al∣most desert and all Iceland tho nearly equal to Great Britain in size only contains about forty thousand people while Poland a country little larger has fifteen millions This difference be∣tween the comparative cold ascribed by the dweller of a hot climate to a temperate one and that real cold which checks all vegetation and life has been little attended to by modern writers to whom a region which to a Greek or Roman  Propertius calls the Getae  wintry  Hibernique Getae pictoque Britannia curru    seemed cold would in fact prove warm com∣pared with Britain or France We read of battles on the ice of the Danube in Roman times but that prodigious river was then surrounded with enormous forests which shaded and chilled all around It is believed also that Ovid is the sole witness of such battles and we must not take poetic exaggeration for solid truth especially seeing the poet wished to represent the country in the most dreadful colours that he might if possible procure a mitigation of his banishment In England the Thames is often frozen and yet the country is one of the most fertile and populous in the world Let us not therefore shiver at Greek and Roman descriptions of Thracian and of Scy∣thian cold Dionysius the Geographer gives us v to v of his Periegesis a dreadful description of the coldness and storms of Ancient Scythia "Where Tanais" says he "rolls over the Scythian fields the North Wind rages and condenses the ice Unhappy they who build their huts around For perpetual to them is snow with the frosty gale The horses mules and sheep die before the piercing wind Nor do men bear the blast unhurt but fly on their cars to another region leaving the land to the wintry winds which rushing with horrid uproar shake the fields and piny hills" This poetic account of the cold in the northern parts of Ancient Scythia is merely comparative between it and Greece and a British poet would perhaps as much ex∣aggerate the heat of that country The tempera∣ture was singularly adapted to population and perhaps as some kinds of animals are infinitely more prolific than others so also may certain races of men as the Scythae or Goths undoubtedly were This ancient Scythia was the real fountain of almost all European nations and was so esteemed by the ancients till the dreams of Jor∣nandes in a benighted age ascribed to a country  which by facts and philosophy ever has been and is now very thinly peopled honours which belonged to quite another clime  If we place the reign of Ninus as Chronologers do about years before Christ we may sup∣pose the Scythians who retired from his power to have been settled in Little or Ancient Scythia extending down the shores of the Euxine to the mouth of the Danube about years before Christ Europe at that time seems to have been thinly inhabited by a few wandering Celts who were to the Scythae what the savages of America are to the Europeans The Sarmatae appear not then to have emerged from Asia that mother of nations wisdom and arts for the Scythae far preceded the Sarmatae in their progress The Celts from the Euxine to the Baltic were called  Cimmerii  a name noted in Grecian history and fable and from their antiquity so obscure that a Cimmerian darkness dwells upon them From the ancients we learn to a certainty that they were the same people with the Cimbri and that they extended from the Bosphorus Cimmerius on the Euxine to the Cimbric Chersonese of Denmark and to the Rhine Posidonius  apud Strab lib  viii informs us that the Cimmerii were the same with the Cim∣bri and that they had extended from the Western or German ocean to the Euxine Which ac∣count is confirmed in both points by Plutarch  in Mario  Diodorus Siculus  lib  ii says the Cim∣bri were esteemed the same people with the Cim∣merii Herodotus IV says that when the Cimmerii on the Danube had heard of the entrance of the Scythae into Europe they were in great consternation and it is clear from his account that the Cimbri were the ancient possessors of Ger∣many Claudian calls the ocean opposite the Rhine the Cimbric  Te Cimbrica Tethys  Divisum bifido consumit Rhene meatu  On the north they seem to have reached the east of the Baltic if the word  Celticae  be not slipt from the margin of some copy of Pliny into the text  promontorium  Celticae  Lytarmis  which he places at the northern extremity of the Riphaean mountains  Hist Nat VI  Mela and Solinus  Mela I Solin cap  mention Cim∣merii in the furthest north on that direction and no doubt from ancient Greek authors In Greece the writers were so fond of representing the people as  autochthones  that no inhabitants preceding the Pelasgi or oldest Greeks who were Scythae as shall presently be shewn can be traced Italy lay in the way of the Gallic Celts or Celts proper not of the German Celts or Cimmerii Ephorus Pliny and Silius Italicus mention a town of Cimmerii in Campania of Italy  Ephor ap Strabon Plin Hist Nat in Italia S ius Ital XII  but Cellarius  Geograph Antiq Tom I in Campania  justly observes that this is a mere fable founded on Homer Odys XI at the beginning where Odysses or Ulysses is said to have sailed from Circe's abode to the land of the Cimmerii in one day Let me add that this day was a day of Circe's magic and to magic every thing is possi∣ble for Homer represents Odysses as having reached the very extremity of the ocean in that day During that magic day he visited Portugal as the ancients say  Ulyssippo or Lisbon is by Solinus and many other an∣cients said to have been founded by Ulysses  and touched at Caledonia  Tacitus  in Germania  mentions the tradition that Ulysses had visited the west of Germany and built Asciburg on the Rhine and a Northern antiquary has hence dreamed that Ulysses was Odin Solinus cap says Ulysses had been in Caledonia the north of Britain  in quo recessu Ulyssem Caledo∣niae appulsum manifestat ara Graecis literis inseripta voto  If we trust the description of Procopius Scotland was the real in∣fernal region of the ancients to which the souls of the dead passed in Charon's boat from the opposite shore of Germany and where of course Ulysses must have gone to converse with them Plutarch  Di Defect Orac  shews that Elysium was in Britain or in the Orkneys as Mr D'Hancarville supposes I have not examined if Homer's description of the Elysian Fields fits Scotland but leave this to some Scotish Rudbeck    then passed to the opposite shore of Germany the real land of the Cimmerii where he descended to the infernal shades The time he took to return is not specified but we may infer it to be equally magical That the Cimmerii were the same with the Cimbri the name and situation might instruct us were we not positively informed of this by the ancients That the Cimmerii or Cimbri were Celts is as certain as so very remote and obscure a subject will bear for  Upon the first appearance of the Cimmerii in Homer we find them placed in those very extreme western regions where other ancients place the Celts  Odys XI The ideas received by Blackwell and others concerning Homer's western geography are quite erroneous The Phoenicians had sailed beyond the Straits of Gibraltar before Homer's time Gades in Spain was founded by them centuries before Carthage See  Huet Commerce des Anciens  Homer's descriptions will not apply to the contracted scale generally assigned His Scylla and Charybdis were not near Sicîly but were two  floating  rocks as he says  Odyss  XII The iland of Circe was one of the Fortunate Ilands and all the ancient traditions suppose this    Upon their first ap∣pearance in Herodotus and Greek history we find the Scythae made war upon them when they entered Europe so that the Cimmerii were not Scythae but original inhabitants of Germany nor were they Sarmatae as all know so must be Celtae the only other people known to the ancients in these parts  Pliny mentions Lytarmis a pro∣montory of Celtica on the east of the Baltic and Mela and Solinus place a remnant of Cim∣merii in that direction hence it seems clear that they were the Celts who gave name to the promon∣tory  Appian is a witness that the Cimbri or Cimmerii were Celts for  lib  i  de bello civ p  he says    'Apu∣leius published a law for dividing the grounds which in the country now called Gaul by the Romans the Cimbri a people of Celts had possessed' And again  in Illyr p    'those Celts who are called Cimbri'  Several names of rivers and moun∣tains in Germany are Celtic which shew that Celts once possessed the country and that the Germans themselves were from the earliest dawn of history Seythians not Celts shall be fully shewn  We find the Cimbri or Cimmerii mentioned in early times as extending from the Euxine to the German ocean and in the first century we find those Cimbri or Cimmerii re∣duced to a small state upon the German ocean in like manner as we find the Celtae the ancient possessors of Gaul pent up in the extremity of Gaul when Caesar entered that country  Taci∣tus mentions the Aestii a nation on the Baltic in present Prussia as speaking a language nearly British that is Cumraig or Welsh These were evidently remains of the old inhabitants confined in that remote situation  Posidonius Strabo Plutarch state that the Cimbri or Cimmerii came  from  the German ocean to the Euxine so that they originated from the northwest and we know from all the ancients that the utmost northwest was held by Celtae so that it follows that the Cimbri were Celtae  The name of Cumri or Cumbri by which the Welsh still call themselves is palpably a grand generic name as the Tartars call themselves Tatars and the Irish Celts Gael or Gauls  And there is every reason to believe that the Welsh name Cumri or Cumbri is that ancient one Cimmerii or Cimbri pro∣nounced by the Greeks and Romans Kimmerii and Kimbri That a part of the Celtic Britons was called Cimbri we learn from Ricardus Cori∣nensis  And it is reasonable to conclude that the north and east of Britain were peopled from Ger∣many by the Cimbri of the opposite shores who were the first inhabitants of Scotland that can be traced from leaving Cumraig names to rivers and mountains even in the furthest Hebudes  See the descriptions of the Hebrides by Martin Macaulay c  From the south of Britain the Cimbri or Cumri expelled the Gael into Ireland as their own writers and traditions bear  Llord Archaeol Brit  Praef  and the oldest names in Wales as in other parts south of Humber are Gaelic not Cumraig It is therefore with great justice now allowed by English antiquaries that the Cumri or Welch are remains of the Cimbri and that the Welch are Celts and their speech a Grand dialect of the Celtic is known to all  All Germany nay from the Euxine to the German ocean was therefore originally possest by the Cimmerii or Cimbri one of the two Grand Divisions of the Celts The furthest west or Gaul was held by the  Celts  properly and pecu∣liarly so called and of whom the Cumri were ap∣parently the offspring who spreading into another region had assumed a new appellation  Perhaps from proceeding in  troops Cymmar  socius sodalis  Cymmod  concordia  Cymmrodedd  concordia or from their  as∣suming  new possessions  Cymmeryd  capere accipere or a name of  honour Cymmeryd  dignitas aestimatio  Cymmeradwy aesti∣matus The words from Davis' Dict Kimb  Herodo∣tus  Lib II et IV  mentions the Celts as living near the Pyrenees Aristorle  In MeteorolDe gen animal lib II c De mirabil auscultDe Mundo si modo Aristotelis sit  and many other ancients mention them as in the furthest west  'above Spain' Caesar  De bello Gall  passim  actually found them confined to the utmost corner of Gaul the Scythians or Goths having under the name of  Belgae  restricted them  from the north and east while the  Iberi  a Mau∣ric race who had passed from Africa to Spain had seized on the southwest part of Gaul where they bore the name of  Aquitani  The famous  Galli  of the Romans were German Gauls not Celts as is clear from the names of their leaders and from the position of their country from which the Celts were quite remote while it joined to Germany But of this when we come to the Germans That the Celts were the most ancient possessors of Gaul is so universally known that it would be vain to il∣lustrate so clear a subject But whether any Celts ever were in Italy seems as uncertain as if any Cimmerii were in Greece In truth those little mountainous corners called Italy and Greece were very insignificant to a vast pastoral people and the spacious plains of Gaul and Germany over which they could range without restrictions of hills and seas must have been the grand seats of such little population as then prevailed in Europe The passage of the Gael and Cumri to Britain ap∣pears to have been in consequence of the Scythic pressure from the east However this be it is cer∣tain that the Grecian and Roman fables have hid all memory of any Celts ever being in Greece or Italy and it is most likely they were not as these countries were in the extremity of either Celtic pro∣gress from Gaul or from Germany so that it would appear that both the Celts and Cumri were forced to recoil by the Scythae before they had reached so far Tacitus mentions the Gothini a people in the south of Germany as using the Gallic or Celtic tongue and it is probable they were re∣mains of the Celts proper who had reached so far in that direction and being in a hilly situa∣tion were employed by the Germans in working mines  Tacit in Germania    From the vast forests which even the Romans found in Gaul and Germany and from other marks it is evident that the population of the Celts and Cumri was very thin and scattered When the Scythae came into Europe the Celtic savages soon finding their inferiority seem generally to have fled to the extremities and Britain and Gaul appear to have been the final receptacles of almost all the Celts The earliest Scythae also carried on very cruel war distinguishing themselves chiefly by the number of enemies they had slain  Herodot lib IV et alii  And the Celtic nations being pastoral the evacuation of their possessions by the vanquished must have been complete as among the Huns and other pastoral nations save only in a mountainous or retired corner or two But when the Celts arrived at the extremities which was not for fifteen centuries as the Scythae only enlarged their territories with their population and consequent necessities the Scy∣thae had by a natural progress acquired more ad∣vanced society and treated the Celts with some humanity In Gaul the Belgae seem to have ming∣led much with the Celts and assisted their wars and counsels against the Romans their common enemy In Germany a few Cimbri remained on the western ocean every where surrounded with the Scythae till little more than a century before Christ when the Scandinavian Scythae a more barbaric race as being remote from civilization poured down upon these Cimbri and not only drove them but the Teutones a German people before them and the southern Germans permitted both to pass thro their territories in search of new habitations The Cimbri and Teutones not ex∣pelled by the ocean overflowing their lands as Plutarch  In Mario  fables but by an overflow of enemies passed into Gaul by the forest of Ardenna for  the Belgae repelled them  Caesar de bello Gall  and ruled Gaul  Ibid  and ravaged Spain  Plut in Mario  for some years till turning upon Italy they were almost extinguished by the sword of Marius years before our aera  Having thus mentioned the state of Europe when the Scythians entered it let us now attend to their progress which has six grand stages    Thrace    Illyricum    Greece    Italy    Ger∣many    Scandinavia  In other words let us now shew that the  Thracians Illyrians Greeks Italians Germans Scandinavians  were all SCYTHAE or GOTHS  I We have seen the Scythae Getae or Goths settled in Ancient Scythia upon the Euxine about two thousand years before Christ This An∣cient Scythia Herodotus  Lib IV See D'Anville's Memoir on Seythia  Acad des Inser  Tome XXXV  describes as reaching down to the Ister or Danube on the southwest and all the nations above the Danube Herodotus calls Scythae and Sarmatae as shall be seen in the Second Part of this essay where the northern pro∣gress of the Scythians into Germany and Scandi∣navia is treated At present the nations south of the Danube call our attention and of these the first which occurs is that of the THRACIANS whom Herodotus  Lib IV c    mentions as the most numerous people in the world save the Indi On the north of Thrace was a small nation who bore the Gene∣ric name of Getae in the time of Herodotus  Lib IV  an appellation afterward found to belong to the whole Scythae and especially the Parental Scythae upon the Euxine In the time of Philip of Macedon we find these Getae south of the Danube called  Scythae  Justin lib IX c This very country Ovid describes as possest by the Scythae whom he in other passages calls Getae It was the  Scythia Pontica  of Constantine I and its bi∣shops were called of  Scythia  and so appear in many councils See Peyssonnel  Observ  sur  les peuples ba  b  de l'Euxine  In all ages of antiquity  Scythae  and  Getoe  are synonymous as to iden∣tity of people Scylax says  Mela 'His Scythis Thracia proxima est'  and they indeed formed the shade be∣tween the grand Generic name of Scythae or Getae and the Specific name of Thracians which had attended the Scythians in passing into a dis∣tinct country separated from Ancient Scythia by a broad and deep river the Danube Those speci∣fic names are no more to be considered than as the names of counties in England and the petty  tribes  into which the specific nations were divided only resemble our towns tho upon a far larger scale as among barbaric nations the people are scattered in separate huts over a wide country which in advanced society would form a city Herodotus includes the  Mysi  or  Moesi  under the name of Thracians and Strabo  lib  vii says that many Greek authors did the same The Moesi were a vast people extending all along the south of the Danube from it's mouth to Illyricum When Macedon was conquered by the Romans their country was erected into two provinces Upper and Lower Moesia In Lower Moesia stood Tomi the place of Ovid's banishment on the Euxine and we learn from his Tristia that he there wrote a poem in the language of the country and that the language was the Getic or Gothic  Ah pudet et Getico scripsi sermon  e  um  c  De Ponto  lib iv ep xiii  Nam dedici Getice Sarmaticeque loqui  Nic te mirari si sint vitiosa decebit  Carmina quae faciam pene poeta Getes  Ib  III ii  From innumerable passages in his  Tristia  and  in his books  De Ponto  we learn that the Getic or Scythic was the language spoken in Moesia and he never it is believed mentions the Moesi but by the name he heard them give themselves that of Getae or Goths  Threicio Scythicoque fere circumsonor ore  Et videor Geticis scribere posse modis  Trist III ult  Vulgus adest Scytharum braccataque turba Getarum  Ib IV vi  For the braccae or breeches were in all ages the grand badge of the Scythae or Goths  Pellibus et laxis arcent mala frigora braccis  Ib V  and speaking of a Greek colony which in consort with the natives founded Tomi he says  Pro patrio cultu Persica bracca tegit  V x  He calls himself  Geticus senis  and his whole poe∣try written there shews that he found but two barbaric tongues in the vast regions around him namely the Getic or Gothic and the Sarmatic or Slavonic For the Scythae lived upon the best terms with the neighbouring Sarmatae insomuch that we seldom read of any war between them but on the contrary find them almost in constant al∣liance Herodotus mentions the Sarmatae as join∣ing the Scythae against Darius and in Roman his∣tory we find them frequently in united arms Trajan's pillar  See Bartoli's Colonna Trajana  instructs us that Decebalus king of the Dacic Getae  The  Daci  as is clear from Pliny was but a name for the southwest  part  of the Getae Strabo says they were one people with the Getae and spoke the selfsame tongue as the Getae and Thracians See Part IIStatius  Sylva    lib  I calls Mars  Geticus maritus  of Venus and Thrace is by all the poets assigned to this God  Lib  II  Sylva  speaking of Or∣pheus who resided in Thrace as all know he puts  Nee plectro  Geticas  movebis ornos  was assisted by Sarmatic cavalry  with both man and horse in complete habergeon Mutual advantages caused this alliance for the wes∣tern Goths had little or no cavalry and the Sarmatae were all cavalry as is clear from all ancient wri∣ters who mention them Hence several Gothic tribes of the frontier settled among the Sarmatae and several Sarmatic tribes among the Goths Of the last the  Jazyges  in particular had three settle∣ments among the Scythae quite remote from the other Sarmatae and every where surrounded by Scy∣thic possessions These were the  Jazyges Eneocadlae  on the east of the mouth of Tyras and the  Jazy∣ges Moeotoe  on the north of the Moeotis and chiefly the  Jazyges Metanastoe  between the Danube and Teiss above Pannonia  See Ptolemy Cluverius Cellarius  This peculiar name of  Jazyges  given to the Sarmatae who settled among the Goths seems to have implied some quality they stood in to the Goths as  auxiliaries  or  cavalry  c Besides these detached settlements of Sarma∣tae it would appear that they often visited the Greek towns on the Euxine to sell their furs c to the merchants and that Ovid thus learned the Sarmatic for there were no Sarmatic settlements marked by any geographer within less than an hundred or an hundred and fifty miles of Tomi But as the Moesi formed only a division of the Thracians let us return to consider the later in general  That all the Thracians were Scythae or Getae and spoke the Scythic or Gothic tongue is clear Vopiscus says of Probus  Thracias atque omnes Ge∣ticos populos aut in deditionem aut in amicitiam re∣cepti  The speech of the Moesi was as Ovid testifies in many passages the Getic or Scythic Strabo gives us the same information in direct terms    Lib VII p  'the Getae a people using the same lan∣guage  with the Thracians' and Strabo's Getae extend over the whole northwest of the Danube and Euxine even to half of Germany  See Part II  Many ancients call the Getae Thracians and others call the Thracians Getae They who wish to see this further illustrated are referred to Ihre  Praef ad Gloss SuioGoth    From Thrace large colonies of the Scythae passed the Bosphorus Thracius and Hellespont into Asia Minor Such were as Strabo  lib  VII mentions the  Bithyni  ns  and  Phrygians  and  Mariandyni  Dionysius  v  to reckons among the Scythians and who from their situa∣tions had clearly past from Thrace the whole nations of the kingdom of  Pontus  on the south of the Euxine namely besides the Bithynians and Mariandyni the  Rhoebi  and  Pophlagonians  and  Chalybes  and  Tibareni  and  Mossynoesi  and  Pei∣leres  and  Macrones  and  Bechires  and  Byzeres  and  Chalcedonians  So that excepting only the Cappadocians who were Assyrians as Dionysius says  v    See also Eustath in locum  the whole nations all around the Euxine were Scythians The  Lydians  were also Scythae for the  Mysians  were surely from Moesia often called Mysia and Herodotus  lib  I says that Lydus and Mysus whence these names were brothers of Caris whence the  Carians  Besides the river Halys the eastern boundary of Lydia was afterward that of Phrygia Major so that the  Phrygians  formed a great part of the Lydian king∣dom and also held Galatia before the German Gauls seized it years before Christ The  Lycians  and  Pamphylians  were also branches of the Hellenes  Herodot lib VII Strabo lib XIV the latter lib VII p tells us that the Mysi of Asia came from those of Thrace and gives us the names of many other nations in Asia of Thracian origin  who were Scythae as shall be  shewn As to Cilicia the only other country in Asia Minor there is no authority for the origin of its inhabitants but as they bordered on the Assy∣rians and Cappadocia there is reason to believe them Assyrians Of these countries many are highly famous About years before Christ Craesus the opulent king of Lydia is celebrated and coinage is rationally supposed to have been invented in his kingdom Midas the rich king of Phrygia is much more ancient but he belongs to fable Pliny  lib  VII  c  informs us from Aristotle that Lydus a Scythian found the art of melting and tempering  temperare  brass a mythologic method of saying that art was invented in Lydia But above all the people of Phrygia Minor or  Trojans  are celebrated over the whole globe with the loudest trump of fame Many learned men have been puzzled at the Trojan names of men places c being Greek while we have no authority for Troy being founded by Greeks but this wonder will vanish when we shall see presently that the Greeks and Trojans were originally the same people and used the same Scythic tongue All the settlements of the Scythae yet mentioned appear to have been thus dilated in less than five centuries or about years before Christ  II The ILLYRIANS were also Scythae  Illyri∣cum  is here understood as reaching all along the north side of the Adriatic from Macedon to Gaul and including Noricum and Pannonia or all south of the Danube bounded by Macedon and Moesia on the east Germany on the north the Adriatic on the south and Gaul on the west The vast Thracian nations of Herodotus  Lib V c Herodotus tells that Thrace beyond the Ister was vast and infinite He also mentions the  on the Adriatic from whom the name of Venetians ought to be traced Polybius  lib  II says the Veneti had a different speech from the Celts and that they were frequent in tragic poetry  certainly ex∣tended over most of this country Strabo  p    says the Iapydes a people between Illyrium and Gaul were partly Celts partly Illyrians so that the Illyrians were not Celts Horace Ode xi Book II instructs us that they were Scythae  Quid bellicosus Cantaber et Scythes  Hirpine Quinte cogitet Adria  Divisus objecto remitras c  The history of this great people is not a little ob∣scure tho Appian has written  M de Buat who when he steers free of etymology has great merit well details what can be recovered of Illyrian history  Hist des peuples de l'Europe  Tome  I II  Philip of Macedon vanquished and imposed conditions on them and from the account of this war preserved by ancient authors it is clear that the Illyrian manners were absolutely Scythic and similar to the Macedonian or Greek Illyricum submitted to Rome about years be∣fore our aera The Thracian Scythae who peopled Illyricum had spred chiefly to the east as we have seen and they also peopled Greece and Italy as shall be shewn so that this population extended no further west The Celts retained all Cisalpine Gaul and their other Gallic possessions till about years before Christ when the Germans or northern Scythae poured in as after explained  III Beneath the Thracians and Illyrians were the GREEKS The denomination of  Greece  is here used in the large sense of the ancient  Hellas  as including Macedon and extending from Thrace and Illyricum to the Cretan and the Ionian and Sicilian seas and Asiaric shore of the Egean in∣cluding the surrounding iles and especially all those in the Egean sea This article is so curious and important as to deserve being a little en∣larged upon  It is universally allowed by the learned that    Pelasgi  was the first name of the Greeks who afterward bore the name of    Hellenes  and all Greece in the large ac∣ceptation  above was called    Hellas  The very name of  Greek  is unknown to the Greek wri∣ters who indeed very seldom use  or in other words speak of the Greeks in general but almost universally tell of Spartans Athenians c One or two very late Greek writers  Callimachus  apud  Strabo lib V has  which also occurs in a piece ascribed to Aristotle The former was of Cyrene and it is likely bore no good will to the old Greeks The later cannot be depended on The Arundelian marbles bear  a suspicious circumstance Lycophron i be∣lieve also uses this new term But these exceptions amount to nothing and it is just to say that ALL the Greek writers are strangers to this name There was a town called  Grain  in Boeotia Homer Il B Strabo lib and the land about it was called  Terra Graeca  Thucyd  apud  Steph but it would be ridiculous to suppose this village afforded the Romans a name for the country  it is believed use  or  Greek  from the Roman  Graecus  or poetically  Graius  How the Romans came to give this name to the people is inexplicable if it were not from the Greek word    anilis old womanly  from  an old woman  a deriva∣tion which the Latin poetic term  Graius  seems also to infer It must therefore have been given in the supreme contempt of a warlike for a learned people and is itself a proof how little names im∣port while we use  Greek  alias  old woman  as a term of supreme honour  There is not the smallest trace to be found in the ancients of any people possessing Greece be∣fore the Pelasgi That the Pelasgi were Scythae or Goths shall now be shewn and if any Celts ever came as far as Greece which was in the very extremity of their western progress the whole ancient writers are totally silent concerning them nor was it likely that such a fact could have escaped Homer if in the least known to Greek tradition  Pelasgi  and  Hellenes  were the sole universal names by which the Greeks ever were known  among themselves For Herodotus  lib  II says that all Greece was formerly called Pelasgia Stra∣bo  lib  V  p  and  lib  VII  p  says the Pelasgi overran all Greece Herodotus  lib  II  c  says the Greeks derived their rites and re∣ligion from them The scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius says the Argives were called Pelasgi Herodotus  b  VII and Pausanias  in Arcad  in∣form us that the Arcadians were Pelasgi and the Arcadians from their inland situation were re∣puted the most ancient and unmixt of all the Greeks Herodotus  lib  I  c  acknowledges his uncer∣tainty about the Pelasgi but  lib  VII  c  he says  the Ionians were Pelasgi and  lib  I  c    'the Athe∣nains were Pelasgi' Apollonius Rhodius and other poets use  for Greece as a name of reverence and antiquity and so also Virgil Statius and other Latin poets use  Pelasgi  and  Pelasgiam  for Greeks and Greece just as if a Scotish poet should put  Pikland  for  Scotland  Dr Gillies in his excellent History of Greece observes  vol  I  p  from Herodotus  lib  I Dionys Hal  lib  I and Pausanias  lib  VIII that 'the colo∣nies of the Pelasgi continued in the fifth century be∣fore Christ to inhabit the southern coast of Italy and the shores of the Hellespont And in those widely separated countries their ancient affinity was re∣cognised in the uniformity of their rude dialect and barbarous manners extremely dissimilar to the customs and language of their Grecian neighbours' But this just remark militates not in the least against the Greeks being Pelasgi and their tongue Pelasgic as their own writers uniformly say For the Greek tongue had been thrown into a ferment by a slight mixture of Phoenician and had been purified with all the art and attention of the wisest and most ingenious men in the world It was the Pelasgic but the Pelasgic refined as the English is from the Saxon No wonder that in Greece  a country where every city was as it were a distinct people some few cities and some mountaineers and ilanders  Herodotus  lib  VI c mentions the disputes be∣tween the Athenians and the Pelasgi living at Mount Hymettus and in Lemnos  should have retained the old dialect and that it was as dissimilar from polished Greek as Saxon from English and should also from de∣tached situation have kept up the old barbaric manners Besides it has been lately shewn  By M Geinoz Mem des Inser Tome XIV  that the  mentioned by Herodotus as Pelasgic was not in Italy but in Thessaly and that Diony∣sius Halicarnassaeus had mistaken it's situation by reading  Croton  for  Creston  as the text of Herodo∣tus actually bears So that the old Pelasgic was as might be expected only to be found in some de∣tached corners of Greece And these separate Pelasgi were either some who had returned from Italy after being defeated by the Aborigenes about the time of the Trojan war if we credit Dionysius of Halicarnassus or others who according to Herodotus had lately come from Samothrace So that these scattered fragments of Pelasgi must not be confounded with the later Greeks being only remnants of old colonies expelled from Italy or late migrations of small parties from Thrace the parent country of the Pelasgi and that they re∣tained their primitive barbaric speech and manners was a necessary consequence of their late arrival from remote and uncultivated regions This plain account at once reconciles all the Greek writers who uniformly affert the whole Greeks to be Pelasgi with the three above mentioned who state some Pelasgi as different in manners and speech from the refined Greeks These later Pelasgi had lately come from Italy and Samothrace and retained their old speech and manners and this singularity puzzled Herodotus who knew that by all ac∣counts the Greeks were Pelasgi as he himself re∣peatedly  mentions yet found that a few detached Pelasgi did not speak Greek but the old Scythic tongue  To proceed Herodotus  lib  I  c  tell us that the Athenians were Pelasgi and the Spartans Hellenes The last he says came from Pthiotis then down between Ossa and Olympus then to Pindus then to Dryope then to Pelopponesus that is they descended from the northeast or Thrace into Greece He also adds that the Athenians or Pelasgi never wandered but the Hellenes did  Mr Clarke in his  Connection of Roman and Saxon Coins  p says that Salmasius wrote in haste and mistook He∣rodotus who means that the Pelasgi wandered but the Hel∣lenes never I suspect Salmastus might return the compli∣ment for not to speak of the article  which all must allow here follows the order of the nations and every inter∣preter including Wesseling the last has understood accord∣ingly if Mr Clarke had read the  page  instead of the  sentence  he would have found himself mistaken  So far did a silly prejudice of making the Athenians  overcome the truth Strabo  lib  XIII  p  and Dion Hal  lib  I  p  say truly that the Pelasgi wandered very much Lesbonax  in Protrept p  says all the Greeks wandered from place to place but the Athenians alone never Wesseling in vain endea∣vours to save Herodotus by saying he only means that the Pelasgi of Athens never wandered In fact Herodotus had difficult game to play had the Athenians not been Pelasgi they could not be ancient had they wandered as pelasgi they could not be  There was the dilemma After escaping from it as he can Herodotus tells us that some Pelasgi dwelled on the Hellespont that is in Thrace a country uncivilized and used a barbarous tongue however adds he the original Attic must have been Pelasgic  Lib I c  c  In ch he tells that the Hellenes used the same speech and were a  part of the Pelasgi  Thucydides  lib  I  c  says the Hel∣lenes were originally a small tribe in Thessaly Eusta∣thius in his commentary on Dionysius observes that Homer mentions Pelasgi near Cilicia in Troas calls Lesbos Pelasgic and the Jupiter of Dodona Pelasgic Jove and that Crete and Lemnos were also Pelasgic as were Argos a part of Thessaly and Arcadia Dionysius  v  calls Samos  the Pe∣lasgic seat of Juno  Justin  lib  XIII  c  men∣tioning the division of the east among Alexander's generals says Tleptolemus had the Persians Peucestes the Babylonians Archos the  Pelasgi  Arcesilaus Mesopotamia This is the most singu∣lar passage i have met with concerning the Pe∣lasgi as if there be no error in the name which is suspected there must have been a whole nation of them in the east unknown to all other writers Carmania is not mentioned by Justin in his long enumeration and the inhabitants of that country were also called  Pasargadoe  and  Parsiroe  one of which words may have been corrupted to  Pelasgi  a name familiar to transcribers After all perhaps Justin meaned Pelasgia of Thessaly for in the beginning of his list he is very erratic giving us the Illyriana between the Cilicians and Medians then Susiana then Phrygia the only difficulty is that in no less than fifteen names before and one after being the last he gives us only eastern na∣tions and the Pelasgi of Thessaly would hardly deserve mention among such large names so that a corruption of the text may well be suspected and that the Pasargadae ought to be read for that there was no nation called Pelasgi in the east we know to a certainty from all the ancient historians and geographers  Thucydides  lib  I  c  says 'before the time of Hellen son of Deucalion the Pelasgi spred all over Greece' They held  Peloponnesus  Hero∣dot  lib  VII  c    et

says the lonians Aeolians Do∣rians that is all the Hellenes or Greeks de∣scended of the Pelasgi Hybrias Cretensis  apud Athen  XV makes an old Pelasgus of Crete boast that his arrows were his riches for with them he seized all In short not to heap autho∣rities unnecessarily these two points are from the universal consent of all the Greek writers as clear and positive as the most luminous part of human history namely  That all the people of Hellas or Greece in the large acceptation above given were  Pelasgi  That  Hellenes  was but a later name of the same People who had been formerly called Pelasgi the Hellenes being a paltry tribe of the Pelasgi who chanced by being the last who came into the country to give their name to the whole  Let us now consider very briefly  Who the Pelasgi were not  Who they were    They were not Egyptians  BECAUSE all the Greek writers remark two small colonies of Egyp∣tians who settled in Athens and Argos in the ear∣liest times and specially distinguish them as quite a different people from the Pelasgi Besides who can dream of Egyptians peopling all Hellas the Iles Asia Minor and entering Italy as the  Pelasgi did who were of barbaric speech and manners while the Egyptians were so small and so civilized a people BECAUSE the Pelasgi had none of the Egyptian speech and manners else Homer and Herodotus who had been in Egypt would have remarked this BECAUSE no ancient has ever dreamed of their being Egyptians and the obscurity of the Pelasgic origin shews they were quite a barbaric people while the Egyptian co∣lonies in Greece and elsewhere are quite marked and distinct BECAUSE the Greek mythology is as remote from the Egyptian as possible BECAUSE the Greek has no affinity with the Coptic or old Egyptian which is a dialect of the Grand Assy∣rian language while the Greek is a mere refined dialect of the Gothic as the learned well know    They were not Phoenicians  from all the rea∣sons above urged respecting the Egyptians He∣rodotus  lib  V  c  specially mentions that the Phoenician colony led by Cadmus to Thebes changed their speech being surrounded by the Iones whom he mentions as Pelasgi and as Hel∣lenes  Such have been the origins ascribed to the Pe∣lasgi by some men of learning and did we not daily see that learning is but another name for want of common understanding what must be our surprize to find the Pelasgi whom all the ancients state as a barbaric people derived from the Egyp∣tians and Phoenicians the nations in antiquity that arrived the first at civilization and whom the an∣cients represent as polishing those very Pelasgi by settling little colonies among them Can absur∣dity be greater A barbaric nation never can spring from a refined one It is an impossibility A refined nation always springs from a barbaric one  In the  Memoires de l'Academie des Inscriptions  a work replete with true and solid literature and  which does honour to the nation that gave it birth there is a dissertation of M de la Nauze  Tome XXIII  at∣tempting to shew that the Pelasgi and Hellenes were different nations But that gentleman wrote upon a mere theory without having employed one quarter of the study he ought to have done and the dissertations of M Geinoz  Tome XIV  and of M Freret  Tome XXI  so amply refute him as to leave nothing to add True it is that Ephorus Apollodorus and Diony∣sius of Ha  carnassus represent the Pelasgi as sprung from Pelasgus son of Inachus king of Argos  There is room to believe that these and many ancients and moderns have confounded the  Argos Pelasgicum  in Pelas∣gia of Thessaly with the Argos in Peloponnesus The former I am convinced was the ancient kingdom of Argos See Homer's Iliad II The ancient kingdom of Sicyon as stated by Eusebius is a vision unknown to earlier writers Danaus an Egyptian founded the kingdom of Argos in Peloponnesus after the termination of the old kingdom of Argos in Pelasgia  and of course as originating in Pelo∣ponnesus This Pelasgus is only mentioned in a verse of Hesiod preserved by Strabo and these authors seized the name as a good father for the Pelasgi but he is a mere being of poetry and the three authors who follow this opinion are of fabulous fame Dionysius telling us all the bat∣tles c between the Pelasgi and Aborigines in Italy as a matter of yesterday while he had not a shadow of ground for one sentence on the sub∣ject To oppose such writers to Herodotus Thucy∣dides and the other most eminent names of Greek antiquity is therefore ridiculous and M Geinoz and M Freret have amply shewn that the Pelasgi came from Thrace  But had the Grecian origins been ever exa∣mined with much attention there are two barbaric nations who might with far higher probability than Egyptians or Phoenicians have been sup∣posed the progenitors of the Pelasgi or Greeks  These are the Celts and the Sarmatians Yet the Pelasgi belonged not to either of these nations    They were not Celts  BECAUSE they can be absolutely shewn to be Scythians a people who originated from the east as the Celts did from the west BECAUSE the earliest Greek writers describe the Celts as confined to the furthest west whereas Greece was surrounded by Scythae BECAUSE the very form and structure of the Celtic tongue are as remote from the Greek as possible the Celts changing the beginning of nouns in many in∣flexions while the Greeks uniformly change the end What we now call the Celtic is half Gothic owing to the Belgae Danes and Norwegians be∣ing mixt with all the Celtae in France Britain and Ireland but especially in the Highlands of Scot∣land where the Celtic is the most corrupt because the Norwegians were possessors of the Hebrides and western coast from the reign of Harold Har∣fagre about till so late as and their descendants remain to this day The words thought Greek by dablers in the Celtic are all Gothic  To derive Latin words from Celtic is a sure mark of a Celtic understanding which always judges by the inverse ratio of reason for the words passed into Welsh from the Romans and into Irish from Christianity whose offices and prayers c were all Latin The roots are all in the Latin not in the Celtic  But the real Celtic is as remote from the Greek as the Hottentot or the Laplandic BECAUSE the manners of the Celts as described by Greek and Roman authors are totally unlike those of the earliest Greeks the people among the former being slaves among the later extremely free Dr Gillies has shewn that the most ancient Greek man∣ners perfectly resembled those of the Germans which Caesar and Tacitus mark as being as unlike those of the Celts as possible Of the Celtic my∣thology we know nothing the Druidic system being mentioned by Caesar as a late invention con∣fined  to the south of Britain and north of Gaul and it is clear from all the ancients that it was no where else to be found It was totally extinguished by Tiberius Pliny XXX Suetonius in  Claudio  and Aurelius Victor say by Claudius It is palpa∣bly of Phoenician origin having been taught by the Phoenicians to the Britons of present Cornwall where they traded for tin and had thence spred north to the extremity of present Wales and south to the Garonne beyond which bounds there is not a shadow of it's existence in any ancient writer whatever They who speak of Druids in Germany Caledonia or Ireland speak utter nonsense and have not a single authority to support them  Druid  in the Celtic implies originally a  wise  or  cunning man  and the name was naturally given by the rude vulgar to the priests of the new doctrine but the name will be found in it's original mean∣ing where Druids never were known Druidic an∣tiquities there can be none except there be any oaktrees two thousand years old Those childishly called Druidic are all Gothic and are found in Iceland and other countries where the very name of Druid was unknown The Celts had no monuments any more than the savage Americans or Samoiedes From Diodorus Siculus and others it is clear that the manners of the Celts perfectly resembled those of the present Hottentots The god  Baal Bell  or  Belenus  the transmigration of souls their cosmogony and theogony are wholly Phoenician what their own mythology was we know not but it in all probability resembled that of the Hottentots or others of the rudest savages as the Celts anciently were and are little better at present being inca∣pable of any progress in society But it is un∣necessary to insist further upon this as the Pelasgi can be shewn to be Scythae and M Pelloutier who alone takes them for Celts clearly proves them Scythae that is as he dreams Celts for he was so  ignorant as to take the Celts and Scythae for one people in spite of all the ancients who mark them as literally  toto coelo  different and in spite of our positive knowledge here in Britain who know the Celts to be mere radical savages not yet ad∣vanced even to a state of barbarism and if any foreigner doubts this he has only to step into the Celtic part of Wales Ireland or Scotland and look at them for they are just as they were inca∣pable of industry or civilization even after half their blood is Gothic and remain as marked by the ancients fond of lyes and enemies of truth  It is to the lyes of our Celtic neighbours that we are in∣debted for the fables of English history down to within these thirty years and the almost total perdition of the history of Scot∣land and Ireland Geofrey of Monmouth most of the Irish historians and the Highland bards and senachies of Scotland shew that falsehood is the natural product of the Celtic mind and the case is the same to this day No reprobation can be too severe for these frontless impostors and to say that a writer is a Celt is to say that he is a stranger to truth modesty and morality Diodorus Siculus  lib  V  p  remarks the cloudy speech and intellect synecdochic phrase and hyperbolic pride of the old Celts Their idiotic credu∣lity was derided by the Roman poet  Et tumidus Galla credulitate fruar  Silius Italicus observes  Vaniloquum Celtae genus  characters of nations change characters of savage RACE  never      The Pelasgi or Greeks were not Sarmatae  BE∣CAUSE there is every reason to doubt that the Sar∣matae entered Europe above a thousand years be∣fore our aera for they were far behind the Scythae in their progress and it is clear that upon their entry they found the greater part of Europe occu∣pied by the Scythae and the Sarmatae were bounded by Scythae on the west northwest and south of Europe BECAUSE the manners of the earliest Greeks as described by Homer were totally unlike the Sarmatic and especially in that  grand feature that the Sarmatae were like the Tar∣tars all cavalry while the Greeks fought on foot and in cars and we know the later to be peculi∣arly Scythic Philip having in his Scythic victory taken a vast number of cars  Justin  lib  IX c Strabo p  and the Belgae and Piki or Caledonians two Gothic nations in Bri∣tain fighting in cars which were also used in Scandinavia down to the Eleventh or Twelfth cen∣tury  See Saxo  lib  III p in the Edda Thor from his using a car is called  Aukuthor  The Normans used cars in the siege of Paris Du Cange Script Norm p  No cars are to be found among the Celts or the Sarmatae BECAUSE the Sarmatic or Sla∣vonic language is as unlike the Greek as can be in grammar structure and nomenclature Some imagine the Slavonic to be modern Greek because written in Greek character They might as well suppose the Celtic Latin because written in Ro∣man character The Slavonic whose chief daughters are the Polonic Russian and Bohemian was anciently written in Latin characters but in the Ninth century one Constantine Cyrillus a Greek first used the Greek capital letter which remains and he invented characters for sounds incompatible with Greek From him the Slavonic character is called  Cyrulic  and after being cor∣rupted by scribes was called  Glagolitic  the Russians only use the Cyrulic  Frisch Hist Ling Slavonicae  to  parts  Berolini  Ludolsi Grammatica Russica  Oxon    vo  But the Slavonic has not the slightest affinity with the Greek That remarkable feature of the Greek the  dual  used in speaking to or of two persons is found in the Gothic and Icelandic but not in the Slavonic which has a  tetral  used in speaking to or of four persons or less  Let us now proceed to shew who the Greeks really were  The Polasgi or Hellenes or Greeks were Scy∣thians of Thrace  This plain sense might argue at once because the Greeks were every where sur∣rounded by Scythae and the sea and no other nation was near them but let us illustrate it a little From the Greek authors above adduced it is clear that all the Greeks were originally called Pelasgi but that the Hellenes originally a small tribe in Thessaly being the last of the Pelasgi who came into Achaia or Lesser Greece they by a chance equal to that of the name of America and many other great names gave their appellation to the whole country Some late Greek fables say that Pelasgus the grandson of Inachus king of Argos from whom as they falsely state the name Pelasgi is derived lived before the deluge of Deucalion by which most of the Pelasgi were swept away Hellen the son of Deucalion proceeded with fresh recruits of Pelasgi into Greece and the Greeks in gratitude took his name and ascribed the renewal of human kind to Deucalion But Herodotus Thucydides and others of the best Greek authors knew nothing of this they repre senting the very same identic people as being first called Pelasgi then Hellenes In Homer's time II ß Hellas was a town of Pelasgic Argos To prevent all doubt however let us first shew that the Pelasgi were Scythae and then that the Hellenes were Scythae    The Pelasgi were Scythae  This may be shewn from different arguments tho the Greek writers have shaded the subject much by the foolish desire of making their nation aboriginal or sprung from the ground on which they lived It is a pity they saw not so far as the philosopher Antisthenes who used to tell the Athenians that such praise belonged to snails and not to men But that the Pelasgi were Scythae appears from this that they certainly descended from the northeast into Greece and the Scythae spred over all these parts For we  find settlements of the Pelasgi on the Hellespont and in Thessaly a country to the northeast of Greece a large country was specially called Pelasgia in the days of Homer and far later Trogus Pompeius in Justin  lib  VII  c  I says expressly that the people of Macedon were an∣ciently called Pelasgi Strabo  lib  VII  p  says that the Thracians under Eumolpus colonized Attica and Herodotus calls these Thracians Pelasgi as above shewn Plutarch in Romulo says  'The Pelasgi as they say roving over the greatest part of the world and having subdued the inhabitants resided in the country which they had conquered' This can only refer to the Scythae Pausanias  lib  X  c  shews the oracle at Delphi to have been founded by Scythae Hyperborei and ancient Greek poets also call it  Pelasgic  Inachus the first fabulous king of the Pelasgi is by some mythologists said to have come into Greece by sea But i am con∣vinced that this idea arose solely from the similarity of the words    the sea  and  a  Pelas∣gian  tho the later word be probably from  overwhelm  because the Pelasgi overran so many countries or more probably from some Assyrian Egyptian or Phoenician epithet given to the old inhabitants by the few Egyptians and Phoenicians who settled among them if it be not a Scythic or Gothic appellative Indeed we cannot be too cautious against being misled by etymology or by similar or identic words for in early and tradi∣tional history they form the very rocks and sands upon which many an antiquarian ship has foundered And the danger is so great that it is best never even to approach them  Ihre is so convinced that the Pelasgi were Scythae that he seems to think the point does not even need proofs yet it were to be wished that he had dwelt  more upon so very interesting and curious a sub∣ject Herodotus Thucydides Strabo assert the Pelasgi to have come from Thessaly into Greece and Thessaly was anciently esteemed a part of Thrace so that the Pelasgi were Thracians that is Scythae Getae or Goths  The term  Hellas  or  Greece  is differently extended by writers some excluding Macedon and Epirus from it as Demosthenes  Philip  III The Hellenes or Greeks severely speaking were Pelasgi who went from Macedon anciently called Pelasgia as Trogus shews down into Greece proper That Epirus was also inhabited by Pelasgi is clear for Dionysius Halicarnassaeus makes the Pelasgi of Italy pass from Epirus and the celebrated oracle of Dodona called Pelasgic was in the extreme north of Epirus It is well known that the Epirian and Macedonian language was the Doric dialect of Greek So that excluding Macedon and Epirus from Hellas or Greece the argument is the same Ancient Pelasgia included Macedon Epirus and afterward that part in later times called Hellas or Greece Perhaps the Thracians who filled this chersonese were called Pelasgi by their northern brethren because every where surrounded by the sea  Pelagos  save on the north  But as it is now universally allowed by the learned that Pelasgi and Hellenes were but differ∣ent names for one and the same people let us pro∣ceed to shew that the Hellences anciently called Pelasgi were Scythae They who wish for fuller information on the Pelasgi may consult Geinoz Freret and others    The Hellenes were Scythae  Even mythology might persuade this for it is well known that Hellen reputed father of the Hellenic name was the son of Deucalion and Lucian  de Dea Syra  p  edit Benedicti    Vol  II says expressly that Deucalion was a Scythian  'Deucalion the Scy∣thian  in whose time happened the great flood' Deucalion was the son of Promethens Apollon III c Prometheus was king of the Scythae Schol Apollon Argonaut II The Titans or family of the gods were of Scythia according to Greek mythologists the hymns ascribed to Orpheus which are ancient tho not his expressly call the Titans the forefathers of the Greeks But leaving mythology which is as distant from history as fable can be from truth let us advance to surer ground Thucydides  lib  I  c  is an incontrovertable authority that the Hellenes were originally a small tribe in Thessaly and Herodotus and Strabo fully confirm this And that the Thessalians were Thracians is clear for Thucydides  lib  II  c  informs us that the Thracians ex∣tended even down to Phocea Strabo calls the Athenians Thracians whom Herodotus calls Pelasgi of Thessaly which was the country be∣tween Thrace and Attica Eusebius p and the Chronicon Paschale p mark the Ionians as Scythae Epiphanius adv Heres  lib  I  p  says that all the people south of the Hellespont were Scythae that is the Macedonians and Greeks  The language and manners of the whole of Hel∣las from Thrace to the Ionian sea were Thracian Scythic Getic Gothic No ancient hints any diversity of speech save as to refinement between Peloponnesus Attica Epirus Thessaly Macedon Thrace Thucydides  Lib I p The Greek instruments of music were from the Scythae and some of them had Scythic names Strabo X Pollux IV The Three Modes were from the Scythae Athen XIV Pollux IV Pliny VII The Phrygian and Lydian were of Scythic origin and Pliny there says that Thamyris of Thrace was author of the Doric mode  well observes that in Homer's time the name of barbarians was not given to the Thracians but that these barbarians and the Hel∣lenes spoke one tongue Diodorus Siculus  lib  II  p  says the Scythae Hyperborel or most distant Scythae used a speech akin to that of Athens and Delos that is as Ihre well explains Pelasgic or Scythic Anacharsis the Scythian philosopher pronounced the Greeks Scythic as he must have learned from their language and manners    apud  Clem Alex Strom  lib  I  p  Even in the time of Xenophon  Exp Cyri  VII tho the Greek was then so refined that he was obliged to use an interpreter at first in conversing with Seuthes a Thracian prince just as a modern  Anglus  would need an interpreter to converse with an  Anglus  of Anglen in Denmark or with a German there was nevertheless such clear affinity observed between the Thracian and Grecian manners and language that  kindred  was given as the military word im∣plying their common origin Nay Ovid is a wit∣ness of the similarity between the Greek and Gothic tongues  Exercent illi SOCIAE commercia linguae  Graiaque quod Getico victa loquela sono est  Trist  V x  And in modern times Salmasius  De lingua Hellenist  Junius  In praef ad Evangel Goth  Meric Casaubon  De vet Lingua Anglicana  Ihre  In praef ad Gloss SuioGoth See also Wallis Gram Angl  pronounce the Gothic and Greek to be merely dialects of the same tongue tho these writers are grossly mistaken in deriving Gothic words from the Greek while the reverse is the truth for the old Icelandic is full of Greek words tho the Icelanders hardly knew that the Greeks existed and could have no correspondence with them Bibliander  De ratione communi omnium linguarum The German is at this day declined as the Greek  says that in the German a dialect of the Gothic of radicals are common to the Greek and to the  Latin which last is merely the Aeolic dialect of the Greek as all know Now of all marks of the origin of nations that of language is the most infallible  From all these proofs it is as clear as so remote a subject can be that the Pelasgi the ancestors of the Greeks afterward called Hellenes from a small tribe of the Pelasgi who were the last that came in were at first settled in Macedon and Thessaly That they were Thracians That the Thracians were Scythae Getae or Goths  It is therefore Historic Truth that the Pelasgi Hellenes or Greeks were Scythians or Goths  Chronologers place the reign of Inachus the first of the Pelasgic stem about years before Christ and Deucalion and Hellen about But the Argonautic expedition before Christ forms the first faint dawn even of traditional history in Greece all preceding this belonging to mytho∣logy The Siege of Thebes and that of Troy together with that expedition are the immortal themes of poets but fairy ground to historians The revolution caused by the Hera∣clidae in Peloponnesus is blended with my∣thology And from thence down to Lycurgus or about before our aera hardly an incident can be found If we therefore suppose the Scythae to have been in possession of Greece and it's iles about years before Christ we shall not greatly err Tho the kingdom of Pelasgic Argos in Thessaly the earliest in Greece may well have existed years before this population was complete as chro∣nologers state it about B C  The Pelasgi afterward called Hellenes were improved by the situation of Greece their new settlement for that favoured country surrounded every where by the sea save on the north proved an attractive centre to small colonies from Egypt and from Phoenicia realms famous for early civili∣zation Cecrops and Danaus who settled in  Athens and Argos about years before Christ were Egyptians Cadmus who about founded Thebes was a Phoenician Letters be∣gan to be used  Diodorus Sic  lib  III and Pausan  in Attic  shew that the Greeks had letters before Cadmus and that the Pelasgic or real ancient Greek alphabet differed from the Phoenician An antiquary will find resemblances in things wholly unlike but the ancient Greek alphabet is not Phoenician The in∣vention of letters so ridiculously discussed is the most simple possible and at least a dozen nations have all invented letters It is the common use of letters that attends civilized society The invention may belong to the rudest Plato witnesses that the Scythae had letters and the Pelasgic or Greek were surely Scythic Of Scythic letters see also Eustathius in II ζ  Cecrops and Danaus had it is likely introduced tillage from the practice of Egypt a country unfit for hunting or pasturage and where from necessity sowing of grain seems first to have been invented  So Dionys Perieg v  Thus Egyptian agriculture and the arts of Phoenicia soon po∣lished this branch of the Scythae while their northern brethren were lost in barbarism But these colonies adopted the Pelasgic or Hellenic lan∣guage and conformed to the Pelasgic or Hellenic rites and customs as Dr Gillies shews from the best authorities particularly Herodot V and VII  passim  Herodotus especially mentions V that the followers of Cadmus changed their speech being surrounded by the Ionians an Hellenic tribe And it might be shewn that the Greek mythology is but an improvement of the Scythic the gods being mostly illustrious princes of the first Scythic empire who were deified by their subjects a custom continued to a late period among the Goths Many ideas of Greek mythology may also be found in the Gothic but this ground must not be lightly trodden and is left to him who can em∣ploy a large work upon it after a remark or two It is well known that the most ancient Greek poets were the sole teachers of the people and were the first who by introducing a portion of  allegory and an elegant method into vulgar tradi∣tion and superstition composed regular systems of theogony and mythology Now these earlier poets and teachers of religion were all of Thrace Linus Orpheus Musaeus Thamyris Eumolpus were all Thracians and Eustathius  has long ago observed this singularity If Thra∣cians they were Scythians or Goths if Scythians they could only use Scythic mythology and tradi∣tions For the religions of the Sarmatae of the Celts of the Phoenicians of the Egyptians were quite remote from the Grecian Blackwell in his admirable Enquiry into the life and writings of Homer Sect xii has well concluded the lan∣guage of Thrace and of Greece to have been the same and especially quotes Strabo who was of Colchis and who says 'that the Trojan language had many words and names in common with the Thracian' The several instances he produces are as Blackwell observes generally known Grecian terms as well as Trojan or Thracian even the others may have been ancient Grecian tho unfit for poetry the only repository of Greek language till Herodotus wrote or about years before Christ Herodotus  lib  II c says the Greeks derived their rites and religion from the Pelasgi who were certainly Scythae of Southern Thrace Anacharsis as above observed said the Greeks  scythicised  or followed the customs c of the Scythae The Titans or family of gods were of Scythia as mythologists agree Plato  in Cratylo  says the Greek rites are all from the barbarians that is as just shewn the barbarians of Thrace  The Greeks fermented into purity by foreign colonies soon assumed quite a distinct character from their Scythian progenitors and neighbours Homer also rose from the eastern shore of the Egean like the sun upon them and diffused an intellectual light and warmth which made their souls vegetate with great thoughts the stems of  great actions So early as about years before Christ Grecian colonies began to be established in Magna Graecia or the south of Italy in Sicily in Africa Nay in Macedon and Thrace and among the more distant Scythae in which later countries for want of tillage and the arts barbarism was long to prevail while owing to fortunate circumstances above mentioned the Greeks had admitted such refinement as almost to pass for another people among their own progenitors A case which may even happen in ruder nations as we know that the Danes who came to Northumberland in the Ninth century were regarded as utter strangers and enemies by their own countrymen the Angli who in had settled in that province  IV Let us now very briefly consider the origins of the ITALIANS or whole ancient inhabitants of Italy This country in its early state may be re∣garded as divided into four parts  Graecia Magna and the whole country southwest of the Apennines up to Hetruria  The part north∣east of the Apennines opposite to Illyricum  Hetruria  The Gallic part from the Alps down to the Senones in Umbria  The first part as appears from Dionysius of Halicarnassus was peopled by Aborigines from Arcadia the earliest inhabitants that can be traced of Magna Graecia and of Latium Dionysius mentions that some Pelasgi afterwards went over but it is clear that the Arcadians were Pelasgi  Herodot VII See also Pausan in Arcad and Cumberland Orig Gent  and M Freret accordingly shews that the Abori∣gines and Pelasgi were all one people The learned look with a suspicious eye upon the pages of Dionysius who only wrote about thirty years before Christ and yet details battles speeches embassies c between the Pelasgi and Abori∣gines as matters of yesterday while Herodotus  and the other ancient Greek writers knew almost nothing of Italy and Dionysius had not one au∣thority But it appears that the Pelasgi whom Dionysius feigns to have fought with the Abori∣gines but to have been vanquished and expelled by them were some few later Pelasgi from Epirus Sicily and this part of Italy were afterward planted with such numerous Greek colonies from about years before Christ and downward that they may be almost said to be peopled afresh In Latium where Rome was founded there were several little tribes and towns of the Aborigines as the Sabines Volsci c Sir Isaac Newton in his Chronology has actually demonstrated that Romulus could not exist till at least years after the vulgar aera or the year before Christ For to the seven kings are given no less than years And of these seven kings three were mur∣dered and one expelled In no history ancient or modern will such reigns of seven kings amount to years much less to But as the  Annus Urbis Conditoe  is followed by the Roman writers it would be most eligible to suppose with some an∣cients that Romulus did not found Rome but that the city was a rude republick with elective chiefs for some time before Romulus However this be the Latin language is a clear proof of the origin of the people being merely the Aeolic dia∣lect of the Greek as Quintilian remarks and as the learned well know This Aeolic has but a few variations from the Doric as the Ionic has but a few variations from the Attic The Aeolians a Pelasgic division peopled Elis and Arcadia or the western and inland parts of Peloponnesus which confims the account of Dionysius that the Aborigines went from these parts The Dorians another Pelasgic or Hellenic division held all the northwest or mountainous part of Greece and being led into Peloponnesus by the Heraclidae possessed Argos Sparta c The Ionians or most  polished part consisted of the Athenians and their colonies on the opposite shore of Asia all the Ionians were more refined by Asiatic commerce and arts The Doric was used in Sicily and Theo∣critus has given us an exquisite sample If Pin∣dar  Suidas says that Pindar wrote in Doric which opinion has been echoed by rote as usual The author not trusting his own judgement consulted one of our best Greek scholars who agreed with him that Pindar writes in Aeolic the lan∣guage of his country Pindar calls his poetry Doric  Olymp I c but in other places calls it Aeolic A  So that Pindar writes in Aeolic grammatically speaking that is in Doric or Aeolic  used the Doric it was certainly from knowing it most adapted to the higher Lyric poetry for the Boeotians were Aeolic and from Strabo  lib  viii we know that their speech was the Aeolic Theo∣critus is thought the only Doric writer In the Aeolic are some fragments of Alcaeus and Sappho It may easily be shewn that instead of four dialects in Greek there is but one  This is no new discovery The learned Lancelot the first who removing many difficulties of foolish erudition gave us a Greek grammar built on the plain simplicity of good sense tells us that there are but  two  Greek dialects the Attic and Doric Strabo lib VIII  init  had long ago said the same thing All the author pretends to have discovered is that  a language cannot be a dialect of itself  In that mass of folly and inaccuracy which we call literature and which stands as much in need of a reform as the christian religion in the time of Luther it is not philosophy that is wanted but common sense Men of learning generally leave common sense at their study door and argue upon learning not upon common sense Others regard literature as a profound thing to be be∣lieved not as what it really is a matter of severe discussion for every man's judgment and sheer folly if not reducible to plain sense Human science is but a small affair but the learned make it look big by placing it in darkness and la∣bour all they can to obscure it while a wife man will ever study to make it clear simple and little  namely the Doric or Aeolic for the variations of the latter from the for∣mer are so trifling as to deserve no notice being less than those of the Somersetshire dialect or the Cockney from the English The Attic with it's  Ionic variations is the Greek language used by all their writers but these above mentioned and can no more be called a dialect than the English is a dialect of the English The Doric Aeolic or old Greek was spoken in Macedon Epirus Italy Sicily and over all Greece save Attica But the Attic from superior polish became the reigning language while in time the other was universally left to clowns and the Attic is the Greek of all countries and authors Homer and Herodotus Asiatic Greeks wrote in Ionic or Asia∣tic Greek that is the Attic rendered more musical by now and then dropping a consonant or asperate and adding a vowel c Doric or Aeolic is sometimes sparingly intermixed by some writers as the dialect of their country ran or to add antique dignity Milton and Shakspere are full of such Doric English But of this perhaps more largely elsewhere  The part of Italy north of the Apennines and opposite to Illyricum was as plain reason would argue peopled by Illyrians who as shewn were Scythae Pliny III tells us that Cal∣limachus placed a people called Peuketi  The Roman  c  being the Greek  x  and ever pronounced so it is put  k  in these proper names for the sake of the English reader  in Li∣burnia of Illyricum In Italy directly on the opposite shore were the Pikeni and further south lay the large country of Peuketia now Apulia of which much may be found in Strabo The Peu∣keti of Liburnia were certainly a part of the Peu∣kini or Basternae a Scythic division who had spred from Thrace into Illyricum and Germany and of whom is fully treated in the last chapter of this tract  The Hetrurians as we learn from Herodotus whom Pliny Paterculus and other of the best ancient writers follow were a Lydian colony a  circumstance not improbable if we consider the great riches and wide commerce of Lydia Dio∣nysius of Halicarnassus a fabulous historian tells us that the Hetruscans were a peculiar indigenal people resembling no other nation in speech or manners He informs us that the Hetruscan speech was not Pelasgic in the most express terms and yet the learned universally allow the Hetruscan letters and antiquities to be Pelasgic or Ancient Grecian Indeed those few detached barbaric Pelasgi who had returned into Greece from Italy and those who had come from Samothrace quire puzzled Herodotus and Dionysius just as if a few Angli from Anglen had in the ninth or tenth century come to England and the writers of the times had been astonished at their speech not being Anglic but Danish The number of books of all ages and languages gives the moderns a prodigious su∣periority over the ancients in judging of the gra∣dations of speech and origin and progress of na∣tions From the ancient Hetruscan inscriptions and other monuments the learned pronounce them Pelasgi looking on Dionysius as no autho∣rity against facts But may we not trust the well informed Herodotus that they were Lydians who about years before our aera planted Etruria For the Lydians as above shewn were Scythae of Thrace as were the Pelasgi so that a similarity in their ancient remains may be expected The Lydians were early polished from their neighbour∣hood with the Assyrians of Cappadocia and were probably somewhat mixt with them so as to tinge their dialect a little whence the error of Dionysius They were a polished and opulent people and the Hetruscans seem to have had skill in the fine arts long before the Latins as the many ancient pieces preserved shew a circumstance appearing to con∣firm the account of Herodotus that they were a Lydian colony By the testimony of Herodotus therefore the Hetruscans were Lydians or Scythae  by their monuments they were Pelasgi or Scythae At any rate they were vanquished and their coun∣try almost peopled afresh by the Romans a Gre∣cian Pelasgic or Scythic nation  The Gallic part of Italy alone remains The Gauls were the latest settlers in Italy It was years before our aera that they took Rome but were defeated by Camillus The old Umbri  Pliny says the Umbri were the most ancient people in Italy for a laughable reason "Umbrorum gens antiquissima Italiae existimatur ut quos  Ombrios  a Graecis putent dictos quod inundatione terrarum  imbribus  superfuissent" Solinus says that one Bocchus thought the Umbri the offspring of the Gauls He must mean the later Umbri for it is clear from Pliny that the old Umbri far preceded the Gauls  seem to have been Illyrians as the Pikeni their southern neighbours but the Galli Senones who took Rome settling in Umbria the whole Umbri began to be reputed of Gallic extract We have large ancient copper coins of towns in Umbria on the Hetruscan and Latin model certainly struck before the Gauls had any idea of coinage  See Olivieri della fondazione di Pesaro Si aggiunse una lettera del medesimo al Signor abbate Barthelemy  c  Pe∣saro  folio  Passerii de re nummaria Etruscorum Disser∣tatio  fol  and others  How∣ever this be it is clear that all the Gauls of Cisal∣pine Gaul were German Gauls not Celts For when Caesar entered Gaul the Celts were confined to the most remote part of Gaul while Germany bordered on the fountain of the Rhine and the northern Alps or in other words on Cisalpine Gaul The Celts lay within the Marne and the Loire while all the east of Gaul had long before been seized by the Belgae Helvetii Allobroges and other German Gauls  It is very remarkable that some remains of Celts still survive among the Alps for the  Lingua Waldensis  of which a specimen is given in Chamberlayne's  Oratio Dominica  is per∣fect Gaelic of Ireland a singularity which has escaped the notice of antiquaries  On the south the whole  Provincia Romanorum  otherwise called  Gallia Braccata  to distinguish it from Celtic and Aquitanic Gaul had been possessed by German Gauls before the Romans as the very name im∣plies for the Celts did not anciently wear breeches while breeches were the chief mark of the Scythians or Goths from the time of Herodotus to this moment For that the German Gauls as being real Germans were Scythians or Goths shall be shewn in the Second Part of this Dissertation In speaking of Gauls the Celts the most distant part of the Gauls are out of all question It is not that dastard race who were vanquished by a lieutenant of Caesar with one legion  Caesar de Bell Gall lib II  ad fin  but the German Gauls who long occupied all the power of Rome that claim our notice in the historic page The Italian Gauls were at any rate van∣quished and their country colonized anew by the Romans a Scythian people  It will be shewn in the Second Part that the Scythae had past to the extremity of Germany and Scandinavia about years before Christ On the south of Germany they extended to the extre∣mity of Illyricum and entered Gaul on that side before that period The Scythae who peopled Illyricum were of the Thracian division separated from the Germans by the Danube and as the same division extended as just shewn into Greece and Italy their population was wholly occupied by these countries and their Asiatic settlements so that pressing to the east and south they never extended beyond the Adriatic where they were checked by the Alps The Celts seem to have possessed all their territories beyond the Adriatic including Cisalpine Gaul till about years before Christ when the Germans arrived and poured into the north of Italy and the east and south of Gaul the Celts flying before them to the west But as the Celts were called Gauls by the  Romans and their country Gaul the name was continued to its new possessors just as the English are called Britons as well as the Welch and as the French are called  Galli  at this day But this the reader will find more fully treated when we come to the Germans The Aborigines or Pelasgi Illyrians and Hetruscans were certainly settled in Italy about years before Christ The Galli not above  It is therefore Historic Truth that the Italians were Scythoe  PART II The extended Settlements of the Scy∣thians or Goths over all Germany and in Scandinavia  PART II  The extended Settlements of the Scythians or Goths over all Germany and in Scandinavia  CHAPTER I  The Germans not of Sarmatic nor Celtic origin  WE are now arrived at the last and most im∣portant part of this Dissertation and a subject upon which the whole modern history or Europe depends Sensible of its prodigious weight i shall examine it with all the sedulous care and minute accuracy which my purpose per∣mits The theme is indeed so vast that large vo∣lumes may be written on it but tho my bounds confine me to the mere outline yet all attention shall be paid to render it scrupulously exact so as to enable the reader to form as from a miniature drawing a true and just idea of the whole  The Scythians or Goths have been followed to their Eastern Settlements in Asia and to their Southern in Europe Let us now trace their Western progress or that of our progenitors If English Scotish Irish if French Spaniard Italian German Dutch Swiss Swede or Dane let the reader attend with reverence as he persues the sacred steps of his ancestors Here every Eu∣ropean is personally interested save the Sarma∣tians of Russia and Poland save the CeltoWelch of England and the CeltIrish of Ireland and of the Highlands of Scotland and save the Fins of Hungary Finland and Lapland  The reader will recollect that the Getae who extended all over the west of the Euxine are shewn to have been the same identic people with the Parental Scythians or Goths On the NorthWest the Basternae a German nation as Pliny and Tacitus shew bordered on the Getae On the SouthWest that division of the Getae called Daci bordered with Germany Pliny IV says  Getae Daci Romanis dicti  'those Getae called Daci by the Romans' Strabo  lib  VIII  'the Getae and Daci have one and the same speech' Steph  de Urbibus  also says the Daci are the same with the Getae and to this all antient and modern writers assent Therefore the Germans bordered on the East with the Getae or Parental Goths So Pliny VIII  Germania Scythiae contermina  Thus we are come to the very crisis of our re∣search If we cannot shew the Germans to have been originally Scythae this dissertation is inept If we can a field of wide curiosity and enquiry opens to the learned of Europe For the origin of government manners laws in short all the antiquities of Europe will assume a new appear∣ance and instead of being only traced to the woods of Germany as Montesquieu and the  greatest writers have hitherto done may be fol∣lowed thro the long descriptions of the man∣ners c of the Scythians and Thracians given us by Herodotus Nay even up to the Abori∣ginal Scythic empire in Persia beyond which there is no memorial of human affairs save in Egypt alone the history of which begins with Menes the first king about years before our aera while the earliest appearance of the Scythians in history is about years after when Vexores was king of Egypt and Tanaus of the Scythae Not to mention the collateral light to be derived from the whole history of the Greeks and Romans who were Scythae as just shewn  Before producing an host of arguments to shew the Germans to have been originally Scythae or Goths i shall briefly consider the two only  Tacitus thinks the Germans Indigenes because no nation could people Germany by sea forgetting that it might be peopled by the much more easy method of a progression by land That they were not indigenes this whole dissertation shews  other opinions which have been formed or can pos∣sibly be formed on this subject  That the Germans were Sarmatae  That they were Celts    The Germans not Sarmatae  The first of these opinions namely that the Germans were Sar∣matae proceeds from such gross ignorance that i am really ashamed to mention much more to re∣fute it I have diligently perused most writers on German antiquities but they had all some degree of reading and could never fall into an error which the whole ancient authors and complete modern knowlege concur to refute This un∣happy discovery must therefore be assigned to its right owner and inventor James Macpherson Esq in whose Introduction to the History of Great Britain it  first  occurs The author of that strange  and truly Celtic work having with that over∣heated rashness which genius colliding with per∣fect ignorance can alone inspire attempted to in∣troduce the most diseased dreams into the History of Scotland thought he could behind his Celtic mist use equal freedoms with the history of Eu∣rope Rash man and ill advised The mist of Celtic nonsense he may gild with the beams of real genius but with the ignorance of a schoolboy to write on the antiquities of the Germans in which the learned of all Europe had been ever conversant was deplorable indeed and worthy of eternal laughter did not commiseration for the in∣genious translator and composer of Irish poetry move every reader to gentleness At the same time it is much suspected that his motives entitle him to no excuse and the high and contemptuous manner in which he treats others annuls all fa∣vour His Ossian shews that he piques himself greatly on being a Celt and will not admit the English or French or Germans or other paltry modern nations to that high honour Indeed the malice and contempt borne by the Celtic sa∣vages for they are savages have been savages since the world began and will be for ever savages while a separate people that is while themselves and of unmixt blood i say the contempt borne by those Celts for the English Lowland Scots and later Irish who are English and Scots is extreme and knows no bounds Mr Macpherson knew that his own dear Celts are and have ever been regarded as a weak and brutish people and in revenge tells us we are all Sarmatae a people eminently martial and famous which he forgets but remarkable as his express quotations shew for nastiness Fielding tells us that a shallow book may like a shallow man be easily seen thro and i can see nothing if the design of Mr Macpherson's book be not to exalt  his sweet Celts at the expence of all truth learn∣ing and common sense  Quand l'absurde est outré l'on lui fait trop d'honneur  De vouloir par raison combattre son erreur  Encherir est plus court sans s'echauffer la bile  Fontaine  Sorry i am toward the end of the Eighteenth Century to be shewing against a British author that the Germans were not Sarmatae that is that a Saxon or a Silesian is not a Russian and does not speak the Sarmatic Slavonic but Go∣thic tongue For if a German student in his first year at college should happen to see this tract he will conclude me as ignorant as my countryman Mr Macpherson to confute abso∣lute nonsense being surely as ridiculous as to write it Stung with this reflection i shall hasten from my aukward situation after a slight remark or two for it would be absurd to draw a sword when a straw will do and i have a champion of far other force to encounter  The  sole  authority which Mr Macpherson can find for this new and profound idea is a passage which with his usual peremptory brevity he quotes thus "  Gothi Vandalique ab antiquis Sar∣matis originem ducunt  Procop lib I"  Intro∣duct p  edit d Not to mention the ig∣norant oddity of quoting a Greek author in Latin the reader must be informed there is no such pas∣sage in Procopius nor even one the least like it This would alone be reckoned a full confutation but as this work is not a controversial one but written with the most sincere and sacred design of discovering the truth i shall produce the real pas∣sage in Procopius to which Mr Macpherson or the person he had the above quotation from  It is thought that some friend has furnished Mr M with his quotations and it is hardly possible otherwise to account for his evidently on many occasions not understanding his own quotations but even adducing them sometimes to con∣tradict his own inferences Perhaps this plan is Celtic See instances in Mr Whiraker's  Genuine History of the Britons  against Mr M  must  have referred It stands thus in the edition of Procopius  Paris    e typographia regia  vo∣lumes folio  lib  I  cap    That is literally  "Gothic nations many and sundry there were former∣ly and are now But among them the greatest and most highly esteemed are the Goths and the Van∣dals and the Visigoths and the Gepidae Anciently they were called Sarmatae and Melanchlaeni some have also called them Getic nations"  Lest the reader may think that Mr Macpherson quoted from the Latin translation it is also added  Plurimae quidem superioribus fuere temporibus hodieque sunt nationes Gothicae sed inter illas Gothi Vandali Visigothi et Gepaedes cum numero tum dignitate praestant Olim Sauromatae dicebantur ac Melanchlaeni qui∣dam etiam Getarum nomen ipsis tribuerunt  This is certainly an authority but an authority as light as a feather compared to any one of the au∣thorities against it Procopius lived in the time of Justinian about the year and was secretary to Belisarius in whose African war he was present His authority as to events of his own times and his whole history is that of his own times as the title bears is very good but as to origins and names of nations in the West of Europe he could know nothing and had no opportunity being a lawyer of Caesarea in Palestine the most distant place that ever Greek author wrote in His hor∣rible ignorance with regard to the West of Eu∣rope  may be judged from his account of Britain so famous for its absurdity The origins and ancient names of nations he could only have from the ancient Greek and Roman writers and when he positively contradicts them as he does here he is certainly in error by quoting from memory and can be confuted now as fully as in his own time being so very late an author That the Goths or Getae were never called Sarmatae and Melanchlaeni as Procopius fables is clear from ALL writers who mention them from Herodotus down to his own time for even Jornandes is not so ignorant as this but mentions the Sarmatae always as a distinct people from the Getae or Goths Strabo who was misled by Ephorus with regard to some Scythae of Asia being Sarmatae never dreamed that the Getae were Sarmatae but distinguishes them repeatedly in express terms The Gepidae and Vandals were German nations the former being a part of the Basternae the latter so well known in the page of Pliny and Tacitus Ovid may shew that the Getae were not Sar∣matae for as above quoted he learned both Getic and Sarmatic Now Mr Macpherson says in his margin p  "The Sarmatae ancestors of the Germans"  and on this he proceeds thro his work without once recollecting that Tacitus a writer whose truth and accuracy every day almost shews more and more to have been perfect makes the strongest distinction between the Germans and Sarmatae thro his whole immortal  Germania  He says the Germans wore tight dress  non fluitante sicut Sarmatae  'not flowing as the Sarmatae wear' and mentioning some remote nations at the end says  Germanis an Sarmatis adscribam dubito  'I doubt whether to put them as Germans or Sar∣matae' Why did he think the Germans indigenes but because he found them totally different from the Sarmatae Had any resemblance existed nothing was so natural as to suppose them sprung  from the Sarmatae a great bordering people That the Sarmatae were a distinct people from the Scythae proper even Herodotus knew at first as appears by his mentioning a part of the Sarmatae learning the Scythian tongue and by the whole tenor of his famous account of the expedition of Darius against the Scythae in which he places the Sarmatae north of the Scythae And Herodotus places Scythae in Germany and Sarmatae to the East of them as shall presently be shewn Diony∣sius distinguishes the Germans and Sarmatae v  c Prolemy the geographer who wrote about forty years after Ta∣citus was the first who from the ample information then received concerning the earth as known to the ancients put down  Sarmatia Europaea  and  Sarmatia Asiatica  in their full and just extent of all the na∣tions who spoke the Sarmatic tongue that is all Russia in Europe and a great part of Poland for the former and that part of Russia which lies be∣tween the Tanais or Don and the northeast of the Caspian for the latter or Asiatic Sarmatia After the times of Tacitus and Ptolemy all writers down to the benighted age in which Procopius wrote mention the Sarmatae as a marked distinct peculiar people They had a vast country to rove in whence only a few from the southwest ever attacked the Romans and tho coins of Constantine I impudently bear SARMATIA DEVICTA he hardly ever had a peep at a cor∣ner of the country Those Sarmatae who invaded the Romans at any future time were indeed so few that we find them very slightly mentioned  So slightly that they make no more figure than any  one of twenty  Gothic nations Quidquid inter Alpes et Pyrenaeum quod oceano et Rheno includitur Vandalus Quadus Sar∣mata Alani Gepides Heruli Saxones Burgundiones et O lugenda respublica hostes Pannoni vastaverunt  Hieron Epist ad Ageruntiam  His enim adfuere auxiliares Franci Sarmatae Laetiani Burgundiones Saxones Riparioli c Jornand sub an    and they never obtained a settlement in any part of the Roman empire save a few in Illyricum For the afterevents of the Sarmatae the reader is referred to any history of Russia or of Poland in which writers of all ages have begun with them tho not one has yet been so illiterate as to consider them in the least connected with the history of Germany Matthias a Michou who wrote his  Sarmatia Europaea et Asiana  about Guag∣nin who in published his  Sarmatiae Europaeae Descriptio quae regnum Poloniae Litua∣niam Samogitiam Russiam Massoviam Prussiam Pomeraniam Livoniam et Moschoviae Tartariaeque partem complectitur  dedicated to the king of Poland and chiefly comprising the lives and por∣traits of the Polish monarchs these authors were two centuries ago so superior to Mr Macpherson as sufficiently to shew that a man who writes upon such trying subjects without reading must only proclaim to the world that he is ignorant Indeed Mr M had only to look into Cluverius Cellarius or any schoolbook of geography to see that he was blundering almost beyond possibility But to conclude this point i shall shew the reader how little the sole testimony of Procopius is to be relied on by actually confuting this passage of that author by another from his own very work and a part of it wholly geographical and of course more accurate This passage occurs in Book IV chap  That is literally  'To him who  passes strait the lake Maeotis and its mouth on the shore antiently dwelled the Goths called Tetraxitae as i just mentioned And at a great distance were placed the Goths and Visigoths and Vandals and all the other Gothic nations who were also called Scythians in ancient times since all the nations in these parts were in common called Scythic Some of them were called Sarmatae and Melanchlaeni and other names'  The reader will at once fee from this that the Sarmatae could not even in the opinion of Procopius be the ancestors of the Goths and Vandals as Mr Macpherson states his testimony seeing that the Sarmatae were but one nation of the many who bore the Scythic name as Procopius here says and a few ancient writers certainly did from ignorance as above shewn rank the Sar∣matea as a Scythic people Let the greatest of modern geographers M D' Anville put the seal to this idle controversy In his  Geographie Ancienne Abregée  Paris volumes  mo  speaking of Sarmatia Europaea  Vol  I  p  he thus ex∣presses himself "Pour donner une idée generale de cette grande nation et la distinguer de ce qui est Germanique d'un coté et Scythique de l'autre il faut dire que tout ce qui parle un langage foncierement Slavon et ne variant que selon diffe∣rents dialectes est Sarmate Et si on trouve ce meme fond de langage etabli dans des contrées etrangeres a l'ancienne Sarmatie c'est que dans les tems qui ont succedé a  ceux de l'antiquité des essaims de cette nation se sont repandus en Germanie jusqu'a l'Elbe et au midi du Danube jusqu' a la mer Adreatique"  I beg pardon of Mr M for saying he has but one authority that the Germans were Sarmatae No He has another And such another Suf∣fice it to say that his weight is prodigious and here he is '  Praeliis ac rerum penuria Sarmatas Getas consumpsit  Pomp Laetus in Claudio' Introd  p  Mr M cannot even quote his forgeries fairly The pas∣sage in Laetus really is  Praeliis ac rerum penuria Sarmatas Getas Scythas Quados consumpsit  Strange yea very strange  What a pity Mr M should have no skill in forgery and did not know that the work given to Pomponius Laetus was written by Julio Sanseverino about  Julii Pomponii Laeti Compendium Historiae Romanae lucem primum vidit Venetiis to De hoc Julio Sanseverino Sabino sive Picentino qui Pomponii Laeti nomen adscivit et Romae A  o  Maii diem obiit vide Frider Hannibalis Stempelii Diss de societate abbreviatornm Romana Jenae to praecipue vero Diarium Venetum eruditorum Italiae Tom xxii p seq  Fabricii Bibliotheca Latina  Hamburgi vo  Tom  III p  That writer must cer∣tainly be an object of perpetual compassion who has tried to overturn the history of Europe upon the authority of a forgery known to every boy and even that authority misquoted Yet who can but langh to see the ingenious father of Ossian building upon a literary fabrication It is so natural  Laetus  and  Aug in Sempron  Aug in Sempron  twice quoted by Mr M is a nonexist∣ence He sleeps with Ossian I have hunted thro many a vast Bibliotheca for him without effect but for all this trou∣ble i sincerely forgive Mr M as a good Christian ought  The author who could foist in the word  Angli  in a quotation p from so common a book as Pliny's Nat Hist may well be supposed to stick at nothing This  Introduction  abounds with such vices as have stained no other work since the world began It might be pronounced the most false and dishonest book ever written were it not only the most foolish and ig∣notant He who in the broad day of authors in every body's hands could act thus what must he have done in the mid∣night of his Celtic nonsense where no eye could espy him  were fit foundations for his bauble  II  The Germans not Celts  Let us now proceed to the second opinion namely that the Germans were Celts This has a far other champion than Mr Macpherson to wit Cluverius a writer of some learning and who would have regarded a misquotation as the ruin of his character In ques∣tions of this kind learning and accuracy are all in all Genius will only mislead by false splendors  but profound learning cold penetration and ma∣ture judgment will throw the steady light of truth over a subject like this Unhappily Cluverius had but moderate learning no penetration and a judgment cool but not vigorous He also wrote two centuries too soon his  Germania Antiqua  being published in when the Gothic and Celtic Languages were unknown no monu∣ments of them being in print so that he wanted all information and is but a blind guide at best Yet has this blind guide been followed by almost all authors down to this day witness Keysler in his  Antiquitates Septentrionales et Celticae  Hano∣verae vo Pelloutier in his  Histoire des Celtes et particulierement des Gaulois et des Germains  Haye tomes mo and Mallet in his  Introduction à l'Hist de Dannemarc  to and many others who as usual with the run of writers found it easier to copy than to investigate But as Cluverius is their guide he may be considered as the sole champion for the learning of Keysler and Mallet was so minute as to amount to nothing Pelloutier is learned but is a great plagiary from Cluverius and they all have not even argued the point but taken it for granted Far other was the practice of the most learned and ingenious translator of Mallet into English who has altered his author so far as infected with this gross error and has in an able preface shewn that it is impos∣sible that the Germans could be Celts But tho he has demonstrated this so fully that i might only refer to his work yet he has not attended to the identity of the Scythians and Goths nor laid open the real origin of the Germans As i am glad of such able assistance in this toilsome task i shall give an abstract of his arguments and add some of my own  He observes that all the arguments of Cluverius and Pelloutier if they may be called arguments fall under two heads  Quotations  from the ancient Greek and Roman authors and  Etymologies  of  the names of persons and places The later he considers first and well observes that  arguments derived from etymology are so very uncertain and precarious that they can only amount to pre∣sumptions at best and can never be opposed to so∣lid positive proofs  At the end he gives specimens of Celtic etymology from that insane work the  Me∣moires de la langue Celtique par M Bullet Besançon  vols folio from which it appears that a man must be a lunatic who founds any thing upon a language so loose as to take any impression Such are  Northampton  North Hampton from  Nor  the mouth of a river  Tan  a river  Ton  habitation  Northill  North Hill from  Nor  river and  Tyne  habitation  Ringwood  from  Ren  a division  w  a river and  bed  a forest  Uxbridge  Ousebridge from  uc  river and  brig  division  Risum teneatis  Let me add that the Irish and Welsh and Armo∣rican tongues the only dialects of Celtic we have for the Highland Gaelic is but corrupted Irish are at this day and from the earliest MSS remain∣ing one half Gothic and a great part Latin owing to the Romans living four centuries among the Welch and the use of Latin in Ireland on the introduction of Christianity The Gothic words are so numerous that Ihre calls the Celtic so re∣puted a dialect of the Gothic falsely because the grammar and structure the soul of the language are totally different but these Gothic words proceeded from the Belgae Saxons and Danes being intermingled with the Welsh and Irish For that these words did not pass from Celtic into Gothic is clear because all the roots branches and relations of the words are found in the Gothic but in Celtic only single detached words as we use the French  eclaircissement  but not  eclairer  c The few words peculiarly Celtic and of which a Glossary by a person of complete skill in the Gothic would be highly valuable have so many significations that to found etymology on them is worse than madness  In the Irish one word has often ten twenty or thirty meanings  gal  implies  a stranger a native milk a warrior white a pledge a conqueror the belly of a trout a wager  c This must be the case in all savage tongues which must be poor and confused But the Celtic i will venture to say is of all savage languages the most confused as the Celts are of all savages the most deficient in understanding Wisdom and ingenuity may be traced among the Samoieds Laplanders Ne∣groes c but among the Celts none of native growth All etymology of names is folly but Celtic etymology is sheer frenzy Enough of Celtic etymology let us leave it to candidates for bedlam and go on  As to the  Quotations  i must beg leave to differ from the learned Translator of Mallet who puts a slight value on them Far from this had the ancients been against me i would at once have acceded to their sentiments for AUTHORITIES ARE FACTS IN HISTORY and to argue against them is to lose labour as we must return to them at last But the learned Schoepflin has so fully shewn in his  Vindiciae Celticae  that the ancients are positive against the Germans being Celts that he has left nothing to add He shews that Dio Cassius a writer of the most suspicious character as well known and whose accounts are often contradictory of Caesar Tacitus Suetonius and others the best informed is the ONLY author who calls the Germans Celts And that against Dio are Herodotus Aristotle Polybius Diodorus Siculus Dionysius Halicar∣nassaeus Strabo Dionysius Periegetes Plutarch Pausanias Ptolemy Athenaeus Stephanus Byzan∣tinus and ALL the Latin authors Dio was in∣deed another Ephorus for such writers will arise and the ancients had ignorant and foolish authors as well as we Caesar and Tacitus so fully confute Dio in this as in many other matters that he is justly regarded as an ignorant fabulist and Lipsius has well observed that he must be redd with extreme  caution Indeed Caesar and Tacitus are so direct against the ideas of Cluverius and Pelloutier that they are eternally opposing their authority whereas they are the very chief authors we can depend on Caesar having warred in Gaul and Germany and Tacitus living as  Procurator Belgiae  Vita Taciti operib praef ex Plinii Hist Nat ni fallor  upon the confines of Gaul and Germany  The learned translator of Mallet next proceeds to positive proofs that the Germans were not Celts but differed from them widely in person manners laws religion and language  In Person  From Tacitus  in Agricola  cap who says the inhabitants of Caledonia resembled the Germans in person while the Britons next Gaul resembled the Gauls that is let me add the southwest Britons who were Celts not Bel∣gae resembled the opposite Celtic Gauls  In Manners  Among the Germans the husband gave a dower to the wife Tacit Germ c Among the Gauls the wife to the husband Caesar Bell Gall  lib  VI Add that we learn from Aristotle Polit  lib  II  c  that the Celts were the only nation who despised women as appears also from the Welsh and Irish histories and their pre∣sent practice while the Germans as Tacitus ob∣serves paid such respect to the sex as almost to adore them  In Laws  Among the Germans the meanest peasant was independent and free Tacit Germ  passim  Among the Celts all save the Druids and nobles  equites  were slaves Caesar Bell Gall  lib  VI  Plebs paene servorum habetur numero  c  In Religion  Among the Germans no Druids nor transmigration of souls  In Language  This is the chief mark of distinct nations and the most certain and unalterable Caesar says that the Celts differed in language  from the Belgae who he informs us descended from the Germans Bell Gall  lib  I  et  II And  lib  I  c  he tells that Ariovistus a German prince learned the Gallic by a long residence in Gaul Sueton  in Caligula c  says that em∣peror caused Gauls to be taught German to attend his mad triumph See also Tacitus in Germania  passim  as where speaking of the Gothini he says  Gothinos Gallica lingua coarguit non esse Germanos  'their Gallic speech proves the Gothini not Ger∣mans' The translator then shews that the Ger∣man and Celtic tongues are as distinct as the Eng∣lish is from Welsh or Irish being radically differ∣ent in construction the essence of language To the GERMAN a dialect of the Gothic belong the following  I TEUTONIC Tudesk or old German  Francic or FrancoTudesk  Swabian  Swiss  Saxon  English  Dutch  Frisic  II SCANDINAVIAN  Danish  Nor∣wegian  Icelandic  Swedish  Broad Scotish  To the CELTIC belong  I The old Celtic quite lost  II Old British or Cimbric  Cornish  Armorican  Welsh  III Old Irish  Manks  Highland Erse  Irish  The Lord's prayer is then given in all these tongues which demonstrates at once that the whole German tongues are of the same con∣struction and have many words in common and the Celtic have the same description but totally differ from the German  The translation of Mallet was published in and in the same year appeared at Paris a second and enlarged edition of Pelloutier's  Histoire des Celtes  in eight volumes vo published by M de Chiniac This edition i have perused with great attention and as very few study such remote subjects and others may be misled by the false appearance of reading and research in that work a hint or two shall be given concerning it It is a bad omen to stumble in the threshold  Our author has not only stumbled but fallen headlong for he thus begins his work  'Les Celtes ont eté connus anciennement sous le nom general de Scythes C'est celui que les Grecs donnoient a tous les peuples qui habitoient le long du Danube et au dela de ce fleuve jusques dans le fond du Nord'  He has said it  The very first sentence is an utter falsehold and absurdity for all the an∣cients distinguish as widely as possible between the Celts and Scythae as the reader may long ere now have judged placing the former in the wes∣tern extremity of Europe and bringing the later out of present Persia Now upon this radical error his whole work turns and the consequence is that it is a chaos of complete delusion from the first page to the last M Formey whose  eloge  of him is prefixt tells us innocently  p xxi  'M Pelloutier m'a dit qu'il avoit lu l'apres souper a peu pres comme on lit la Gazette tous les auteurs dont on trouve la liste a la tete de son premier tome de l'Histoire des Celtes' Every reader might have seen this and it is to be supposed that he also wrote after supper for his work is certainly written be∣tween awake and asleep Tho he has not redd above half what he ought and his constant atten∣tion to his clerical duties prevented his read∣ing save after supper when his mind was ex∣hausted to the dregs yet he appears to have looked into the indexes of many books and his silent suppression of all the passages of the ancients con∣cerning the Asiatic origin of the Scythae cannot be excused His overheated imagination saw the Celts every where tho if he could have under∣stood the first page of Caesar he might have learned that in his time they held but one third part of Gaul Weakness is excusable but truth must not be sacrificed to falsehood and his sup∣pression of all the evidence relating to the Scythae is most illaudable Indeed he always suppresses what he cannot answer a plan very easy and  very common His design is to shew Gaul the parent country of modern nations in Europe and thus to support the French dream of universal monarchy But it may boldly be said that he who in treating history the grand instruction of man∣kind does not place the evidence against as well as for before his readers he is a propagator of falsehood and an enemy of society But let him be judged by the verdict of one of his countrymen  Si l'honneur et la bonne foi sont requises dans toutes les actions de la vie elles sont indispensables dans la composition de l'histoire Et l'historien qui manque a ces conditions et qui deguisse a dessein la qualité des evenements est un traitre et un faussaire qui abuse de la confiance du public  Fresnoy  Meth pour etudier l'Hist  Tome V p  CHAPTER II  The Germans were Scythoe FIRST GRAND ARGUMENT From Identity of Language  THE opinions that the ancient Germans were Sarmatae and that they were Celts being shewn to be erroneous i proceed to establish that they were Scythae who continued their progress from ancient Scythia and their extended territo∣ries of Getia and Dacia into Germany the bor∣dering country It must here be premised that no author has fallen in my way who has entered into this Cluverius and his latest followers think the Germans Celts The modest and industrious Boxhorn and a few others who put the Germans as Scythae have been so ignorant as to take the Sarmatae Celts and Huns also for Scythae So that no solid science could stand upon such vague premises  Brotier in his excellent edition of Tacitus Paris volumes to says the Germans were Scythae But whom did he mean by  Scythae  The Danish and Norwegian and Swedish antiquaries used to think that the Goths came strait from the Euxine to the Baltic and that all the Gothic nations in Europe went from Scandinavia as Jornandes bears an author whom they formerly fought for as  pro aris et focis  But  of late their whole ancient Eddas Sagas Chro∣nicles c shewing on the contrary that the Goths came to Scandinavia not many centuries before Christ but mentioning no prior egression from it their natural good sense has led them to pass these ideas but they have not treated on the German origins while the German writers still generally follow Cluverius Montesquieu Gib∣bon and other late eminent writers discuss not the subject but regard the Germans as aborigines  The reader's whole attention is therefore request∣ed to the arguments for this grand point which as lucid order is studied in this little essay as much as possible shall now be arranged in numerical battalion after a remark or two By the Ger∣mans i mean as the ancients did the whole na∣tions from the Danube on the South up to the Northern ocean or extremity of Scandinavia on the North and from the Rhine and German ocean on the West to the river Chronus or Nie∣men on the East For tho the Vistula was gene∣rally put as the eastern boundary of Germany this was owing to the Venedi and one or two other Sarmatic nations being found between the Chronus and Vistula but the whole  Germani Transvistulani  or vast division of Germans called BASTERNAE amounting as Pliny states to a fifth part of the Germans were beyond the Vistula in present Prussia Polachia Masovia and Red Russia So that the Chronus or Niemen was cer∣tainly the proper boundary between the Germans and Sarmatae tho the superior course and fame of the Vistula madé it the popular barrier That the Scandinavians were Basternae or Transvistular Germans right reason might instruct us had we not the positive authority of Strabo with colla∣teral proofs from Tacitus Ptolemy and others as after explained For this was the part of Ger∣many which immediately led from the Euxine to Scandinavia and the passage to Sweden was not long  and was divided by the iles of Gotland and Oeland The reader must also observe that tho my proofs that the Germans were Scythae from Asia open a new field yet heaven forbid that i should make a new hypothesis in ancient history No  The truth is always old  What shall now be shewn was ori∣ginally well known tho afterward lost I do not discover new opinions but old facts that were hid under the soil of error when they are dug up they will be found to evidence their antiquity by their fabric  The learned and judicious Sheringham observes that there are three ways to judge of the origin of nations  From Relation of Speech  From accounts preserved in Ancient History  From Similar Manners  But that the first is the chief and most certain of all arguments  Linguarum Cognatio cognationis gentium praecipuum certissimum∣que argumentum est  This is indeed common sense for if we found a people in Japan who spoke French they must be of French origin and it is one of these truths which cannot be controverted Language is a most permanent matter and not even total revolutions in nations can change it A philosopher well told Augustus that it was not in his power to make one word a citizen of Rome When a speech changes it is in many centuries and it only changes cloths not body and soul But not to insist on a point universally allowed it can be proved that the language of the old Ger∣mans was Scythic or what has been infallibly above shewn to be the same Gothic by these fol∣lowing facts  FIRST GRAND ARGUMENT The old German and Scythic one and the same Speech  This may be proved as follows  We have a venerable monument of the Scythic or Gothic language in the gospels translated by Ulphilas bishop of the Goths in Maesia in the  year  Socrates IV Sozomen VI Nicephor XI Jornandes c Isidor Chron Goth sub anno aerae Hispan Roderic Toletanus II says Gudilas episcopus Gothorum literas eis tradidit quae in antiquis His∣paniarum et Galliarum libris adhuc hodie supersunt et spe∣cialiter quae dicitur Toletana Scriptura  These four gospels the remains of a  translation of the Scriptures for the use of his people have been repeatedly published since the first edition by Junius to down to that of Mr Lye Another fragment containing part of the epistle to the Romans has been lately dis∣covered in the library at Wolfenbuttle and pub∣lished by Knitel archdeacon of Wolfenbuttle Other fragments of the Gothic language have also been found of which see Mr Lye's notes to his edition of the Gothic gospels All these remains as being Gothic are Scythic for it has been fully shewn that Goths and Scythae were but synonymous terms for one and the same people  The consonance of these Scythic remains with the old German is universally known The Fran∣cic is a dialect of the Teutonic Tudesque or Old German and the gospels of Ulphilas bear such affinity to the Francic of which fragments are preserved in the early French historians and else∣where that De la Croze and Michaelis have pro∣nounced these gospels to be part of an old Francic version tho Lye Knitel and others have re∣futed that opinion from history and comparison of the dialects Schilter in his invaluable  The∣saurus  Schilteri Thesaurus Antiq Teuton Ulmae vols folio  has given us many large monuments of the Tudesque or Old German from the seventh century downward and it is clear that the Scythic of Ulphilas is the same language Wachter's learned Glossary of the ancient German also certi∣fies this point And the skilful Ibre after hesi∣tating whether the gospels of Ulphilas bear most  resemblance of the German or Scandinavian dialect of the Gothic gives it in favour of the former adding that some words as might be ex∣pected are neither found in the old German nor Scandinavian  In Dissert de Evangel Gothic Vide etiam Dissert de veteri lingua Danica apud Gunlaugi Vermilinguis et Rafnis poetae Sagam  Hauniae    The AngloSaxon as it is called but which should be stiled the AngloBelgic is also known by all to be a venerable and excellent dialect of the Tudesque and it bears such inti∣mate connection with the Scythic gospels that the noble work of Lye the  Dictionarium Saxonico et Gothico Latinum  London vols  folio  is built wholly upon their identity  The Scandinavian of which the oldest reliques are Islandic and begin with Arius Frodi in the Eleventh century is a dialect of the German The remains we have in it are more modern by four centuries than those of the German for no∣thing shall be built on the Runic inscriptions and those Islandic reliques are more polished and the words more shortened a grand mark of a po∣lished tongue as long words are of a rude and primitive one  See Mr Horne Tooke's sensible and ingenious  not only because more modern than the German but because the Islandic was refined by a long succession of poets and historians almost worthy of Greece or Rome Hence the Icelandic being a more polished language than the German has less assinity with the parent Gothic The Swedish is nearer related to the Icelandic than either the Danish or Norwegian the two later countries being under one monarch of German extract and from the proximity of Denmark to Germany many words have crept in But that the Swedish is the daughter of the Scythic of Ulphilas is amply known from Ihre's work the  Glossarium SuioGothicum  Nor is there occasion to insist upon  facts now so universally certified as the identity of the Scythic or Gothic preserved in Ulphilas and other ancient remains with the German and Scandinavian tongues  Even in the darker ages these facts were well known Rodericus Tosetanus says  Teutonia Da∣cia Norvegia Suecia Flandria et Anglia unicam habent linguam licet idiomatibus dignoscantur  'Germany Denmark Norway Sweden Flan∣ders and England have all one speech tho distinguished by their idioms' And Walafrid Strabo who wrote under Louis the Pious Emperor of Germany about observes justly  Gothi qui et Getae eo tempore quo ad fidem Christi lice  non recto itinere perducti sunt in Graecorum provin∣ciis commorantes nostrum id est Theotiscum sermonem habuerunt  De reb Eccl c  'the Goths who were also called Getae being in the provinces of the Greek empire  the Byzantine  at the time they were brought to the Christian faith tho not by the right way  they were all Arians as was Ulphilas their apostle  had our language that is the Tudesque' This fact Walafrid must have seen from the translation of Scripture by Ulphilas mentioned by the ecclesi∣astic historians and famous from the first over all christendom  The modern German a language spoken in a far greater extent than any other of Europe and now beginning to be much studied from the num∣ber of good books in it resembles the Gothic gos∣pels more than the present Danish Norwegian or Swedish and has certainly more ancient sta∣mina Its likeness to the Asiatic tongues in harshness and inflexible thickness of sound is very apparent In form structure and in numerous words it agrees with the Persian as all know  Lips Cent III epist Scaliger Burton de veteri lingua Perfica Boxhorn Praef ad Orat Dom a Cham∣berlayne c c The learned Marsham justly observes  Scythae sunt tum Persae quam Go  hi Germanique    and Busbequius shews that the clowns of Crim Tartary not Tartars but remains of the old Scythae speak a language almost German Charle∣magne was first emperor of Germany Before he conquered it petty states prevailed Fragments of Tudesque or German of his age remain The Francic and Saxon are dialects of it The for∣mer is generally stiled FrancoTudesque and the later should be called SaxoTudesque being a different dialect from the Saxon of England falsely so called for it was Belgic and spoken in England by three millions of people three hundred years before Caes  r The Saxons and Angli ne∣ver exceeded a hundred thousand and adopted the tongue of the inhabitants which they called Saxon or Anglic as their possessions lay the former to the south the later to the north The Saxons conquered the Angli and yet the later gave their name to the country  The Kingdom of the West Saxons subdued the rest D'Anville in his  Etats formés en Europe apres la chute de l'empire Romain en occident  Paris  to  wonders that the name of the vanquished Angli remained to the country but names are merely accidental  Such was the effect of one book written by an Anglus Beda's  Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum  The English is Belgic mixt with Roman or as now called French The Roman was never entirely spoken in Britain as in Italy Spain Gaul The Welsh tongue sufficiently shews this Britain was a remote fron∣tier and the Romans who defended it keeped se∣parate from the people In Spain and Gaul the inhabitants were wholly romanized all were Ro∣mans In Britain the Romans were solely the Ro∣man legions The inhabitants of Gaul who all spoke Roman far outnumbering the Franci their conquerors their tongue tho spoken of with con∣tempt at first as the  lingua Romana rustica  pre∣vailed over the Francic and was called Roman but now French Such was also the very case in  Italy and Spain where the  Romano  and  Romance  overcame the rude Gothic and is now the language It must also be remarked that the ancient German has not the smallest similarity to the Celtic or to the Sarmatic and that the older it is the greater is the distance  Mallet  London  vol II notes    This argument from identity of speech is so certain and conclusive that from it alone we might invincibly infer that the Germans were a Scythic progeny but to place so important a point beyond a shadow of doubt even to the most ignorant or prejudiced mind let us proceed to other arguments  CHAPTER III  The Germans were Scythae SECOND GRAND ARGUMENT From the testimonies of Ancient Authors  IN examining the origin of nations language is justly esteemed an infallible criterion But in all other ancient facts the authorities of ancient writers form the ONLY evidence we can possibly have Without them we can know nothing of the subject Human affairs by no means proceed ac∣cording to reason speculation or philosophy but depend on various contingencies which can only be learned from ancient authors It cannot therefore be too often repeated that AUTHORITIES ARE FACTS IN HISTORY Lord Bacon introduced experimental philosophy against theories of nature and in history theory is even more foolish than in na∣tural philosophy seeing that nature has great laws which history has not What we now call the phi∣losophy of history was introduced by Voltaire and a few other ignorant theorists unacquainted with that great reading upon which the experimental philosophy of history must stand For if we reason upon falsehoods our reasoning must be false and in ancient history facts can only be found by the most assiduous perusal of all the writers who state these facts or throw light on them If we trust conjecture or philosophical nonsense there is no end for a thousand authors may give us a thou∣sand theories and we must return to the ancients at last The migrations of nations are also facts so very ample and striking and leave such traces  that even the most ignorant know them as there is not a peasant in Europe who is to learn that the North American colonies went from Britain When therefore ancient authors universally agree in such large facts their testimony is infallible and presents every evidence of historic truth  SECOND GRAND ARGUMENT The Ger∣mans were Scythae from ancient authorities  The knowlege which the Greek and Roman authors preceding Caesar had of Germany was obscure and confined About years before our aera Herodotus the earliest writer who can afford us any intelligence on this subject thought that the Danube rose near a town of the Celts called Py  rhene not far from the pillars of Her∣cules  Lib II  that is the Pyrenees in Spain He also tells that the Eridanus or Po ran into the Northern ocean in present Prussia where the amber always was and is now alone found an idea which ap∣parently arose from this that the amber was brought from Prussia overland to the mouth of the Po there to be shipped for Greece About years before Christ Apollonius Rhodius affords equal marks of ignorance in geography For he makes the Argonauts in their return pass from the Euxine up the Danube into the Cronian or Baltic sea thence into the Eridanus or Po which with Herodotus he supposed fell into the Baltic a branch of which leads them into the Rhone an arm of which later would have carried them west to the great ocean had not Juno cried to them from the Hercynian rock or Hercynian forest in Germany  Argonaut IV  This was the course of their voyage and such was the ignorance of an exquisite and learned poet who had studied and lived long at Alexandria in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus and had certainly the use of the largest library of ancient times Polybius who wrote about  years beforè Christ says in his third book 'All that country between the Tanais and Narbonne to the north is unknown to us till by curious in∣vestigation we learn somewhat concerning it They therefore who write or speak otherwise are either ignorant or fabulists' This restriction includes all Germany Scandinavia Britain and the most of Gaul  But this ignorance of the ancients related chiefly to the geography of these regions for as to the great divisions of men who inhabited them namely the Scythae and Celts they were by no means ig∣norant We knew that the Japanese were a Chinese colony and that the Icelanders had past from Norway for centuries before we had any thing but fables as to the geography of these countries and such was the case with the ancients One navigation may discover the name language and manners of a distant people while to give an accurate geography of their country whole cen∣turies are required especially in ancient ages when voyages were only made by ignorant mariners and traders for the mere sake of gain The Phoenicians were settled at Gades in Spain and at Utica in Afric about years before Christ or three hundred years before the building of Car∣thage which last was the foundation of a party who had fled to a well known shore and not an original trading colony Gaul and Britain were certainly visited by the Phoenicians long before Germany and Scandinavia were at all known to the Greeks or Romans But the Phoenicians as Strabo tells us carefully concealed all knowlege of these countries lest other nations might interfere in their trade The story of the Phoenician ship is well known the master of which observing a Roman vessel following his tract in these seas ran aground on purpose and thus wrecked his own ship and the Roman that followed him This act was deemed so patriotic that he was richly re∣warded  warded by the senate of Carthage The part of Germany at the mouth of the Vistula or present Prussia was certainly known to the Greeks before the time of Herodotus and it was the country that supplied all the amber in ancient times as it does in the present That Greek merchants travelled there and had established the mart for it at the mouth of the Po there is every reason to be∣lieve And if the natives brought it down to that mart the merchants would equally learn their name situation language and manners Herodotus men∣tions the Marus or Moraw of present Moravia a river to the west of the Vistula and says it rises in the country of the Agathyrsi whom Dionysius and other geographers place on the north of Marus up to the Balric The Eridanus of Herodotus may well be interpreted the Vistula for there is no reason why the Greeks should not have given the same name to the two differentrivers especially while their authors afford many examples of this kind The description of Herodotus can alone apply to the Vistula at whose mouth only amber was and is found and where the region of the Hy∣perboreans was as he and other ancients state And this commerce of amber seems to have opened the connection between the Hyperboreans and the Greeks so famous in antiquity M D' Anville has erred in placing the Hyperboreans in the north of European Russia a region unknown to the an∣cients Ptolemy and Agathadaemon who laid down his maps making the Riphaean mountains run east and west at the fountain of the river Tanais and it is only by ancient ideas that we must estimate ancient geography The east of the Baltic was the  Mare Cronium  the Great Northern or Frozen Ocean was quite unknown to the ancients and indeed how could they get at it for of Scandinavia as shewn in the last chapter they only knew as far as the Wener lake and lake of Stockholm But the Greeks know to a certainty  That the Celts were in the west of Europe above Spain or in Gaul and Britain  That in the North West of Europe or in present Germany and Scandinavia were the Scythae and the CeltoScythae or those Scythae in Gaul and Britain who bordered on the Celts as the IndoScythae did on the Indi  That the Sarmatae were on the North of Greece to the east of the Scythae of Germany All which will clearly appear from the following authorities  Herodotus places the Celts quite to the West and the pillars of Hercules whereas in his geogra∣phy of Scythia Book IV ch  et seq  he evi∣dently supposes that the Scythians spred all over the North West of Europe even to the Northern ocean or Baltic The Agathyrsi and Geloni he ranks among the Scythian nations who united in the general league against Darius  ch  Now Dionysius and Ptolemy place the Agathyrsi and Geloni upon the Baltic sea We learn from this that the ancient Greeks knew that the Scythae ex∣tended to the utmost northwest extremity of Eu∣rope or up to Scandinavia  Xenophon who wrote about years be∣fore Christ says in his  Memorabilia Socratis  lib II §  'In Europe the Scythians bear sway' shewing that as the Persians were the ruling people in Asia so were the Scythae in Europe Had the Scythians of Europe been regarded by Xenophon as confined to Ancient Scythia he could not have given them this description but he palpably understood that they extended into the heart and furthest parts of Europe and bore universal sway in it  Aristotle  in Meteor  I says the Ister or Danube slowed from the Pyrenees mountains of Celtica and  De Gen An  II he speaks of the cold of Scythia and adds that the country of the  Celts above Spain    is also cold He as well as Herodotus knew that  the Celts were confined to Celtic Gaul and to Britain for he calls the tin which was brought from Britain  Celtic tin  'they say that Celtic tin melts much sooner than lead'  De Mir Ausc  In the next century or about years be∣fore Christ Pytheas Xenophon Lampsacenus and Timaeus authors quoted by Pliny Nat Hist IV all say that the ile Baltia or Glessaria a peninsula of the Prussian coast in which amber is found 'lay opposite to Scythia distant a day or two's sail' Pliny quotes them separately and they vary in some points but all agree in this which shews to a certainty that the Greeks knew the Scy∣thians to extend to Scandinavia and over all the north of Germany as before mentioned while the Celts were confined to Celtic Gaul and Britain My plan confines me else i could convince every reader that the Greeks five centuries before Christ had far more accurate ideas of the Scythic and Celtic nations than Pelloutier a writer of yester∣day But it is the property of an over heated imagi∣nation to raise fumes and darken every subject while the  lumen siccum  or dry light of judgement pene∣trates and illustrates all Fancy blends judgment discriminates Fancy finds similitudes judgment dissimilitudes  In the century following Polybius is the most eminent writer but his subject extended to Gaul not to Germany Scymnus of Chios an elegant geographer in verse who wrote as Dodwell shews years before Christ and addresses his work to Nicomedes king of Pergamus tho he quotes many authors only shews that the Greeks had made no greater progress in geography  At length full day arises upon the west and a distant splendor upon the North of Europe Caesar who entered upon his province of Gaul years before the Christian aera from personal knowlege enlarged by the cool penetration and  luminous comprehension of his great soul was to be the fountain of this irradiation From his ad∣mirable Commentaries on the Gallic War it is evident that the Celts far from being as Pellou∣tier idiotically supposes spred over all Europe were in fact confined to one third of Gaul as every schoolboy knows who has redd the first line of his work  Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres Quarum unam incolunt Belgae aliam Aquitani tertiam qui ipsorum lingua Celtae nostra Galli appellantur Hi omnes lingua institutis legibus inter se differunt  Bell Gall  lib I  init  For the North east third was possessed by the Belgae who as Caesar informs us from the best information that of a neighbouring na∣tion were of Germanic origin and their lan∣guage manners and laws were different from those of the Celts as Caesar shews being palpably German The Aquitani held the southwest part of Gaul and were also of different language manners and laws from the other two being Iberi who had passed from Spain to which they had come from Africa  The Iberian language survives in the Cantabric and Basque The old Mauric is little known and few specimens have been published there is a dissertation on it at the end of Chamberlayne's  Oratio Dominica  De lingua Shilhensi and some information may be found in Shaw's Travels It is yet spoken by the  Kabyles  or Mountaneer Clans  Kabyl  ah  Arab  Clans  in Mauritania and is called the  Showiah  or  Sbillah  being quite different from the Arabic the general speech of the country These Kabyles have to this day the manners described by Sallust They are divided into clans as the Fins Laplanders Celts and other radical savages who are incapable of progress in society for clans are peculiar to savage society and vanish at the first ray of industry and civilization  Strabo IV p says of the Aquitani 'they resemble the Iberi more than the Galli or Celts of whom they have neither the form nor idiom' Nay in their last refuges Britain and Ireland the Celts were a vanquished and confined people For the Belgae as Caesar shews had all the southeast of present England and the Piks a GermanoScandinavian people as Tacitus and Beda prove had all the  north of Scotland down to the friths of Clyde and Forth In Ireland it is clear from Ptolemy that the Belgae held all the southeast parts and that they had not proceeded from Britain but from Belgic Gaul and Germany for of the  Menapii  and  Chauci  or  Cauci  we find no trace in Britain  There was a small  town  called Menapia in Wales just opposite to the  people  Menapii in Ireland and apparently founded by them But we find no Menapii in Wales the people in whose territory Menapia stood were the Dimeti a tribe of the Silures or Celts of Wales See Ptolemy and Richard  but have them in Ireland and in Germany and Belgic Gaul But of this in the Enquiry into Scotish history where it shall be shewn that the Belgae were the ruling people in Ireland and that the Irish or old Scotish Royal stem is really Belgic or Gothic These Belgae are the  Fir Bolg  of the Irish Annals with whom their real history begins and such was their superiority that to this day  Bolg  in Irish implies  a noble man  and also  a man of science  Even in the regions retained by the Celts which were minute they were mingled with German Goths and their speech with German or Gothic words The old Irish grammarians as Mr O'Conor  In his publication of O'Flaherty's Vindication of Ogygia Dublin  vo  praef p xxvii  tells call their Gallic or Irish tongue  Berla Tebide  or a mixt language The Welsh as all know is even in it's most ancient remains full of Danish and English words The Gallic Celtic or Irish of the Highlands of Scotland is of all the Celtic dialects the most corrupt and mixt with Gothic owing to the neighbourhood of the Piks and to the Norwegians holding the Hebudes and western coast of Scotland from the time of Harald Harfagre or about till when regained by the Scots but the Norwegians remained as principal tenants and the chief families in these parts are all Norwegian So that in fact  the Celtic far from being a pure speech is the most mixt and corrupt in the world For the Celts were so inferior a people being to the Scy∣thae as a negro to an European that as all history shews to see them was to conquer them and as they had no arts nor inventions of their own they of course received innumerable words from other tongues But the nomenclature of a lan∣guage is only it's dress while it's grammar forms the soul and body and the Celtic grammar is totally remote from that of all Gothic languages So much so that by a mode perhaps unknown to any other speech they decline nouns beginning with labials by altering the initials as the Goths Greeks and Romans altered the termination Thus  Mac  is  a son Mhic  pronounce  Wic    of a son  c Nay the pronouns alter the beginning of nouns thus  Pen a head i Ben his head i Phen her head y'm Mhen my head  A strange and horrible absurdity as it cancels every rule of language and must shew a confused and dark understanding in the people who use it nay even to speak it must  ex post facto  throw a mist over the mind Yet is it much to be wished that professor∣ships of the Celtic tongue were established in our universities that such remains as are of that speech might be explained and placed in a just light We naturally reverence what we do not know  Ignotis reverentia major  Tacit  and this may be called the Celtic century for all Eu∣rope has been inundated with nonsense about the Celts When we come to the truth about them and Time always draws truth out of the well the Celtic mist will vanish or become a mere cloud  To return Caesar by shewing the Celts to be confined to such small bounds palpably marks that other nations had gained ground on them so as to confine them to such a contracted space And in his fine description of the Germans in book VI and in other passages he shews them to  have totally differed from the Celts What peo∣ple then were they That they were not Sarmatae all know and the only other people whom the ancients know in the northwest of Europe were the Scythae as just shewn It follows then that they were Scythae The Greek authors had cer∣tainly acquired some knowlege of Germany two centuries at least before Caesar for he says book VI  Germaniae loca circum Hercyniam silvam quam Eratostheni et quibusdam Graecis fama notam esse video quam illi Orciniam appellant Volcae Tec∣tosages occuparunt  And we shall see instantly that Diodorus Siculus one of the best informed and most judicious of the Greek historians and who wrote after Caesar's discoveries repeatedly calls all Germany even to the furthest west and north  Scythia  It may be asked why does not Caesar call the country Scythia Why this new appella∣tion of Germany Be it answered that another country was peculiarly called Scythia namely Little or Ancient Scythia on the Euxine And that tho the Greeks called all that tract to which the Scythians extended Scythia yet those Scy∣thian nations bore different names as Thraces Illyrians c Of course Caesar finding the Ger∣mans so called by their countrymen of Belgic Gaul gives them most properly their specific and not generic name Nor does Caesar write as a geographer but as a warrior he says not a word of their origin c but only describes their manners Tacitus  in Germ  specially informs that the name of Germans was a late one  It is worth remark that there was a Persian people called    Germans  Herod I There was also a Greek one called  Teutani  in Peloponnesus Pliny III Steph Byz The same Scythic speech produced the same appella∣tions    Diodorus Siculus was cotemporary with Julius Caesar and profited by his discoveries He  tells us  lib  V  p  edit Wesseling that the people "who inhabit the inner parts above Mar∣seilles and at the Alps and on this side the Py∣renees are called Celts But THOSE who inhabit BEYOND the Celtic region and the parts toward the SOUTH and situated on the ocean and THOSE toward the Hercynian mountains and all onward even to Scythia  are called Gauls" Wesseling observes that this is false because the Romans called the Celts also Gauls But Diodorus no doubt knowing that the Celts were not those Gauls celebrated in Ro∣man history but quite a distinct people posses∣sing the inner or further part of Gaul he with propriety puts them as different nations By the Celts Diodorus understands those of Caesar ex∣tending from the northwest extremity of the Alps above Marseilles into the inner parts of Gaul Those beyond the Celts to the south on the ocean are the Aquitani Those toward the Hercynian mountains and onward to Scythia are the Belgae His Scythia is palpably Germany as it is in the following passages "They the Gauls are very fierce on the north and bordering on Scythia  so that they are said to devour men as those Britons also do who inhabit Ireland"  lib  V  p  Again speaking of amber he says it comes chiefly from an iland of Scythia above Gaul    ibid  meaning Baltia or Glessaria as the above quotations from Pliny shew  In the time of Tiberius about years after Christ lived Strabo His valuable work is full of the Scythae and he tells us  lib  XI  p    ed Casaubon  'All the nations toward the north∣ern parts the ancient writers call Scythians and  CeltoScythians'  Strabo says lib I that the names Celtiberi and Celto∣scythae 'comprehended thro ignorance distinct and separate nations under one term'  Now tho in speaking of Asia XI he says after Ephorus that some Sar∣matae there were Scythae yet in describing Europe he distinguishes between the Scythic and Sarmatic nations Thus he says "above the Getae are the Tyragetae and above these the Jazyges Sar∣matae" and he tells us  lib  VII that Homer by his Hippomolgi and Galactophagi  Il  XIII means the Scythae and Sarmatae So that by the Scythians he means not the Sarmatae In book I he says the earth is divided into four parts to the furthest east the Indians dwell to the furthest south the Ethiops to the furthest west the Celts to the furthest north the Scythians And Strabo knew that the Scythae of Germany were the Getae for book VII p he says 'The Suevi hold the south side of Germany which is beyond the Elbe After them lyes the region of the Getae narrow on the south toward the Ister and toward the Hercynian forest part of whose mountains it comprehends but extended largely to the north even to the Tyragetae' By the Getae Strabo pal∣pably means all the Germans east of the Elbe namely the  Vandali  and  Hermiones  and  Basternae  of Pliny being three of his five grand divisions of the Germans the Basternae actually stretching east to the river Tyras on which the Tyragetae dwelled Strabo also as shall be after shewn places Basternae in Scandinavia Hence it is clear that Strabo looked on these three grand divisions of the Germans as Getae Scythians or Goths and of course would have regarded the others as such had he learned as we do from Tacitus that the whole Germans to the furthest extremity were all of one origin language and manners  Mela wrote about the year He distin∣guishes the Scythians and Sarmatae and gives a  separate chapter on each In b III chap he tells us that the northern Scythae were called  Belcae  a name no where else to be found and ch he tells us  Thule Belcarum littori opposita est  'Thule is opposite to the shore of the Belcae' So that in his opinion the Scythians held Scandi∣navia opposite to which Thule is placed by all the ancients  Pliny the natural historian wrote in Vespa∣sian's time about years after Christ In his fourth book ch he tells us that the Scythian nations including the Sarmatae stretched all along the north and northwest of the Danube and then adds the following memorable and decisive sentence Before reading it let us recollect that Pliny prefixes to his immortal work the contents of each book and a list of the authors used in that book from which it appears that his reading was as his nephew informs us infinite No wri∣ter in all antiquity ever had such exuberance of information and the question could not be sub∣mitted to a more able arbiter Hear his verdict SCYTHARUM NOMEN USQUEQUAQUE TRANSIT IN SARMATAS ATQUE GERMANOS NEC ALIIS PRISCA ILLA DURAVIT APPELLATIO QUAM QUI EXTREMI GENTIUM HARUM IGNOTI PROPE CETERIS MOR∣TALIBUS DEGUNT  The name of Scythians is every where changed to that of Sarmatae and Germans Nor has that ancient appellation continued save to the most distant of these two nations who live almost unknown to other mortals  The Sarmatae as above explained were by some less informed ancients regarded as a nation of the Scythae for before Ptolemy's time who wrote near a century after Pliny little intelligence had been got about the Sarmatae a people who occupied a country as large as all the Scythian possessions put together Their language was totally different as the Slavonic is from the Gothic or Scythic of Ulphilas But  some Greek writers knowing that the Scythae ex∣tended all over the northwest of Europe had con∣sidered the Sarmatae also as a Scythic nation The name of Scythians given to the Sarmatae was but a vulgar inaccuracy as we term the Americans WestIndians Distant objects become indistinct and their appellations of course inaccurate Yet tho wrong in denominating the Sarmatae Scy∣thians the ancients knew they were perfectly right in giving that name to the Germans after they had discovered that the Sarmatae were quite a different race from the Scythians seeing that the German language and manners proved them the same people with the ancient Scythians on the Euxine This is clear even from Strabo who calls the Germans Getae as just shewn and from all the Greek writers after Ptolemy who name the Germans Scythae For the whole Ger∣man nations were called Scythians or Goths in the fourth century as the vast German division of the  Vindili  or  Vandali  as some MSS of Pliny the  Sucvi Angli Langobardi  of Tacitus c c c are uniformly called Scythians or Goths after that time For that the Greeks denominated all these nations Scythians whom the Latins called Goths has been amply demonstrated in the be∣ginning of this essay The reader is requested to attend to this important circumstance for if he falls into the vulgar delusion of the Goths being a paltry tribe of Germany or of Scandinavia he will err prodigiously The Latin name  Goths  and Greek term  Scythians  belong to the whole barbaric nations from the Caspian to the Adriatic east and south to the British channel west and Scandinavia and river Chronus or Niemen north and north east The Sarmatae are by all writers after Ptolemy placed on the northeast of the Scy∣thae in present Poland and Russia and marked as a separate and peculiar great people It was  from the vast plains of Getia Gothia or Ancient Scythia and of Germany that the ruder Goths spred over Europe on the fall of the Roman empire and not from the bleak and desert mountains of Scandinavia or from one little district in Germany as childishly dreamed  To produce all the other ancient authorities that the Germans were Scythae would swell this tract to a folio volume and what are given will it is believed fully suffice Tacitus thinks the Germans indigenes for a reason which has de∣servedly excited laughter namely that all the ancient migrations were by sea not by land As if the inhabitants of such a region as Germany could be transported by sea like the little colo∣nies of antiquity He adds that no nation would proceed from better climates to people such a country forgetting as M Brotier justly remarks that necessity and security are the parents of bar∣baric population The Norwegians have peopled Iceland and planted Greenland But the mi∣racles of Vespasian the tale of the phoenix and such remarks as these only shew that man is composed of inconsistency and that the strongest on some occasions are the weakest on others as the only sublime historian who ever wrote could sometimes sink most profoundly from his eleva∣tion It can even be shewn from Tacitus that the Germans were Scythae for we have remains of the language of several nations he mentions in Germany and these remains are Scythic or Go∣thic as is the whole German language at this day He himself tho he distinguishes the Ger∣man speech and manners from those of the Celts and Sarmatae in the most direct terms yet no where distinguishes them from those of the Daci as he with the Romans calls these Getae who bordered on Germany It may be said the Getae might be a German emigration as well  as the contrary but against this are ALL the ancients as every page of this work witnesses for they all state the Scythians to have proceeded from the east to the west and the whole tenor of that progress is marked and distinct from Persia to Britain  CHAPTER IV  The Germans were Scythae THIRD GRAND ARGUMENT From Similar Manners  IT must be remarked before proceeding to the third and last class of arguments namely those arising from similarity of manners that it is of all others the most uncertain For similar stages of society will produce like manners among all mankind A species of men capable of the utmost progress that society affords will in it's original state be on a level with another species incapable of any progress at all Did we suppose parallel customs proofs of identic nations the savages of North America are the same with the ancient Germans described by Tacitus But as on the other hand dissimilar manners might argue against the sameness of nations proofs shall here be produced of perfect similarity in those of the southern Scythians and those to the furthest north of Germany and Scandinavia after thus warning the reader not to rely too much on this point which were it fully proved would prove nothing to a cool enquirer But full and irrefragable ar∣guments that the Germans were Scythae or Goths having already been submitted this article may be considered as only a diversion after the task is done Yet as this is no work of amusement let us pass this relaxed part with a few hasty hints  THIRD GRAND ARGUMENT The Germans were Scythae from similar Manners  Herodotus in his fourth book ch to gives us a long account of the manners of the Scy∣thae and a peculiar happiness seems to have at∣tended this favoured nation for Tacitus has de∣scribed those of their descendants the Germans so that the clearest splendor is thrown on the sub∣ject To run a parallel would swell this essay to a vast size and they are so like that they need only be referred to Wormius Bartholin and other northern antiquaries have remarked that the de∣scription given of the Scythae by Herodotus ap∣plies perfectly to the Goths of their country even down to a late age The chief difference arises merely from a local circumstance It is that the ancient Scythae on the Euxine described by He∣rodotus had found their fine breed of Persian horses thrive equally well in their fertile possessions on the temperate shores of the Euxine while in Germany and Scandinavia the cold was then too severe for that southern race and the indigenal breed was as tacitus states very small Hence the Ancient Scythae were chiefly cavalry while the Germans and Scandinavians had little or no cavalry This difference was a necessary effect of climate and infers no distinction in the people any more than the different life led by the British in the East Indies from what they use here de∣stroys the identity of the people In Iceland the Norwegians differed prodigiously in manners from those in Normandy Calabria or Sicily But to instance a few particulars of similar Manners in the Scythae and Germans    Domeslic Life  Both Scythae and Germans lived by hunting pasturage and rapine  See Herodotus  lib  iv and Tacitus  in Germania  pas∣sim  Both had a few agricultural nations but the tilled ground as the pastoral belonged to the commu∣nity or tribe and they quitted it at the year's end to more to another Herodotus observes that these Scythae who were agricultors did not use the corn for bread but parched it over the fire that is as Pelloutier well explains in order to use it in broth and for ale so Tacitus of the Germans They drank out of horns  Xenophon Exp Cysi lib vi et vii Caefar de Bell Gall vi Fragm Diodori Siculi in Excerpt Valesii p Tacit Germ  Antiquarii Septent  Wormius Bartholin c Theopompus observed that the kings of the Paeonians had of those horns which held three or four quarts Athen xi p Pliny xi Athenaeus lib iv says that    pour out drink  which properly sigoifies  horn the liquor  came from the ancient Greeks their drinking in horns  so the Germans or out of the sculls of enemies  This gratified both luxury and revenge See a late ex∣ample in Paul Warnef  so the Germans Ale and meed were the drink of the Thracian Scythians  See Priscus in Excerpt p  and those of Scandinavia Both drank healths and drank before entering on business  Xenophon Exp Cyri vi vii So the Persians He∣rodot lib i  Both nations burned their illustrious dead and buried their ashes in urns under hil∣locs or tumuli  Herodot Tacit c  Both went almost naked using only a skin of some wild beast to cover them in winter The chiefs and rich of both nations used a close tunic and breeches  Herodot vii Tacit in Germ c The Tunic was the  carc  calla  which Dio says was close as a corselet  The Thracian Scy∣thians pricked and stained their bodies  Herodot v Strabo c  so did nations in Germany  The Arii Tacit  nay the Belgae of Britain  Caesar de Bell Gall  and the Piks of Norway and Scotland  Herodian Claudian c      Religion  Herodotus says v "All the kings and people of Thrace worship Mercury chiefly They swear by his name and believe themselves his progeny" The Greek and Roman writers applied the names of their own deities to those of barbaric nations as the smallest attribute of the idol led them If a rude image held a scepter it was Jupiter if a purse Mercury if a sword Mars Hence great confusion for what denoted one attribute with the Greeks and Ro∣mans might with the barbaric nations mark quite another as nothing admits of various inter∣pretation more than symbol Tacitus says of the Germans  credunt Tuistonem deum terra editum et filium Mannum originem gentis conditoresque  He∣rodotus gives the god a Greek name because in some symbol he resembled Mercury The Gothic historians draw all their kings from Odin Paulus Warnefridus  Hist Langob  says  Wodan quem ad∣jecta litera Gwodan dixerunt ipse est qui apud Ro∣manos Mercurius dicitur et ab universis Germaniae populis ut deus adoratur  But the Gothic mytho∣logy being only traditional and no temples nor statues being found among them till a late pe∣riod Odin became the god of war and a fabu∣lous hero who as the Sagas agree led the Goths from Scythia on the Danaster or Tyras into Scandinavia This fable shews the universal tradi∣tion of their origin but Odin was merely the name of a deity or rather an epithet and they who speak gravely of him as an hero are de∣ceived It was Odin Mars literally war that opened their progress into the wilds of Scandina∣via The Gothic mythology has been weakly handled but might by a complete parallel be shewn to be the ancient Grecian The Greek gods were the progeny of Caelus and Terra Mannus or Man was descended of the gods for in the hymns ascribed to Orpheus the Greeks are called their progeny and so the Greek poet  quoted by Saint Paul says men are the offspring of Jove The ancient Germans had also a Mars and a Hercules as Tacitus says The former it is likely was Odin and Warnefrid may be mis∣taken the later was Thor famous in the Edda and Voluspa for his strength But he was the Ju∣piter or chief god of northern mythology In fact even the Greek mythology is a mass of con∣fusion as all traditional matters must be and the several mythologists differ radically in the most essential points no wonder then that the Gothic is embarrassed The fables of Tiresias of Proteus and other small Greek tales may be traced in Gothic traditions  Olaus Magn lib iii Torf Hist Norv lib i  The Goths consulted the héart of victims had oracles had sibyls had a Venus in Freya a Neptune in Nocken Parcae in the Valkyriar  See Bartholin Wormius Mallet c  Jofur  was a name for the Supreme Being as  Jove  Dryads Satyrs and the whole beings of Greek and Roman superstition may be found in the Scandinavian creed Superstition is rooted and permanent Fairies and the other scenery of romance were not brought into Europe by the Crusades as superfici∣ally imagined but belong to Icelandic sagas written before the Crusades Tournaments existed in all ages of the Goths The  Ludus Trojanus  of the Romans was of them Isodor Chron Goth mentions them as the favorite diversions of the Goths See Procop iii Ennod paneg c A fragment of Varro shews them known to the Germans and German Gauls In the Edda daily tourneys  to outrance  are the amuse∣ment of the gods The Greeks had tournaments and armed dances as were the Salian Armilustria of Rome Varro de Ling Lat v  The Scythians worshipped Mars whose symbol for they had no images was a pile of swords Herodotus IV says they believed the Earth wife of Jupiter Tacitus tells that the Suevi worshipped Hertha or the Earth    Government  Herodotus was unhappily no politician and is quite mute concerning the go∣vernment of the Scythae Nor do i find in all antiquity any description of the Scythic constitu∣tions  so that the full light we receive from Tacitus concerning those of the Germans cannot be for∣mally paralleled with those of their Scythic ances∣tors The Greeks have been shewn to be Scythae let us therefore derive a few rays from them Fa∣mily government is always aristocratic of father and mother as Locke shews But as a family differs widely from a community and as the later is composed of many of the former the aristocracy of family became instantly democracy by the fa∣thers of families directing public affairs by joint coun∣sels Thus it is demonstrable that democracy is the most ancient form of government for the very idea of a king is unknown to early society In war one leader was of necessity chosen and he in many instances confirmed his power so as to become a king Had there been no wars there would have been no kings and the mythology of all kings being descended of the god of war is plain truth But it has not yet been remarked that in early society even monarchy is democratical The king is but one of the people In the Greek heroic ages there were kings because there had been wars yet the people was free even to licence Dr Gillies has in the second chapter of his his∣tory of Greece made a formal parallel between the Greek government of those times and that of the Germans tho he suspected not the real cause of that identity namely that they were all one people He well observes that in freedom of debate in the public assemblies and the privileges of liberty being preserved to the meanest subject and other points there is a perfect resemblance The only difference he marks is that beauty of the Greek character priest and king being united in one person Yet the earliest Greeks had sepa∣rate priests and augurs as the Germans so that this can hardly be called a difference And among the Scandinavians in Iceland the priest was also the magistrate and offered sacrifice in  the midst of the judicial circle of stones before he sat to judge  The Feudal System has been treated of by many writers but so uncommon a quality is pe∣netration that all of them to this day have con∣founded two grand divisions in it's history which are totally dissimilar These divisions are  The Feudal System  The Corrupted Feudal Sys∣tem  The former extends from the earliest account of time thro the early history of Greece and Rome till the progress of society changed the manners of these nations and thro the early his∣tory of the Goths and Germans who overturned the Roman empire down to the eleventh century At this period commences the Corrupted Feudal System and lasts till the fifteenth century when the Feudal System began after it's corruption to dissolve quite away The Corruption of the Feu∣dal System took place soon after the petty king∣doms of the former ages were united into great monarchies as the heptarchies in England be∣came subject to our monarch and so in other countries This corruption is no more the feudal system than any other corruption is the substance preceding corruption that is quite the reverse and yet such is modern superficiality that it has been termed The Feudal System  and all writers estimate the Feudal System by it's cor∣ruption only just as if we should judge of a re∣public by it's condition when changed into an aristocracy About the Eleventh century by the change of small kingdoms into one great mo∣narchy and by a concatenation of other causes which it would require a volume to detail the Feudal System corrupted and  corruptio optimi pessima  into a state of aristocratic tyranny and oppression Before that period no such matter can be found The greatest cause was that no∣bility and estates annexed were not hereditary till that time so that the great were kept in perpetual  awe and that check was removed before the cities had attained such privileges and powers as to balance the nobility In Ancient Greece and Italy confined spots cities were from the first the grand receptacles of society To the want of ci∣ties the subjection of the people to their lords and all the Corrupt Feudal System is owing To cities the ruin of that Corrupted Feudal System generally called the Feudal System is solely to be ascribed Of the Corrupted Feudal System no∣thing shall be added here as it commenced at a late period and is foreign to my work save one or two remarks on Chivalry an institution quite misunderstood It was so heterogeneous to the Feudal System that had the later lasted pure chivalry would never have appeared But as it is often so decreed that out of the corruption of a constitution a remedy for that corruption springs such was the case with chivalry an institution which does honour to human nature The knight∣hood was not hereditary but an honour of perso∣nal worth It's possessors were bound to help the oppressed and curb the tyrannic spirit of the hereditary great those giants of power and of romance Had the ridicule of Cervantes appeared three centuries sooner we must have branded him as the greatest enemy of society that ever wrote As it is a sensible French writer  M Le Grand in his curious and amusing  Fabliaux ou Contes du xii et du xiii Siccle  translated into modern French Paris vols  mo  well observes that it now begins to be questioned whether his book be not worthy of execration All professions have their foibles but ridicule ought never to be exerted against the benefit of society Cervantes envied the success of the romances but ought not to have derided an institution so beneficial be∣cause even fables concerning it had the fortune to delight his cotemporaries But to give a remark  or two on the genuine Feudal System which was purely democratic as the corrupted was aristo∣cratic  M D'Hancarville  Recherches sur les arts de la Grece  Londres  tomes  to  rather fancifully dates the feudal system from the first Scythic empire for Justin says  His igitur Asia per mille quingentos an∣nos  VECTIGALIS  fuit  'Asia was  tributary  to them for one thousand five hundred years' and especi∣ally  Asiam perdomitam vectigalem fecere modico tri∣buto magis in titulum imperii quam in victoriae prae∣mium  This last passage is a definition of homage and the feudal system was that of the Persians who were and are Scythae or Goths as ancient au∣thors and their own speech testify Xenophon  De Exped Cyri lib I  tells us that when the younger Cyrus came to Cilicia he was met by Epyaxa the beautiful wife of the satrap who according to the custom of the east presented her acknowledged liegelord and superior with gold silver and other precious gifts Indeed the feudal system about which so much noise is made is the natural fruit of conquest and is as old in the world as conquest A terri∣tory is acquired and the state or the general be∣stows it on the leaders and soldiers on condition of military service and of tokens acknowleging gratitude to the donors It was known in the Greek heroic ages It was known to Lycurgus for all the lands of Sparta were held on military tenure It was known to Romulus when he re∣gulated Rome It was known to Augustus when he gave lands to his veterans on condition that their sons should at fifteen years of age do mili∣tary service The reason it did not preponderate and corrupt in Greece and Rome was that it was stifled by the necessary effects of cities as above∣mentioned In Persia where there were no cities  of any power or privilege it preponderated and corrupted at an early period  The feudal system whether in its original de∣mocracy or corrupted into aristoracy must limit the power of kings for men who hold their pos∣sessions on military service must of course have arms in their hands and even in absolute govern∣ments the soldiers are free witness the praetorian bands and armies of imperial Rome and the Turkish janisaries By the feudal system every man held arms and freedom in his hands Montesquieu has begun his account of the feudal system with that of the ancient Germans given by Tacitus and prides himself in leaving off where others began A writer more profound would leave off where Montesquieu begins  The ideas of most writers concerning the Eng∣lish constitution are extremely shallow It was not found as Montesquieu states in the woods of Germany It peculiarly belongs to a pastoral state of society as may be inferred from Montes∣quieu himself  Esprit des Loix liv xxx  The Scythic progress may almost be traced by similar forms of government prevail∣ing and it might be argued from this that it was the constitution even of the first Scythic em∣pire To England it must have come with the Belgae for from Tacitus we know that it was that of all the Germans and the Belgae were Germans It is found wherever the Goths went In the woods of Germany every man had a voice in the general council  De minoribus rebus principes consultant de majoribus OMNES Tacit Germ  This was when every man had no trade save that of soldier but in a more ad∣vanced state of society other occupations arose upon which men subsisted and could not neglect to attend to public business They therefore looked on the chiefs who had nothing else to do as their  natural representatives and left public business to them During this stage of society the chiefs and  probi homines  men of rank and character were really regarded as representatives of the commu∣nity as implied by the common form in old laws  et tota communitas regni nostri  for how could the community's consent be specified save by the peers and  probi homines  who represented them When the Goths overturned the Roman empire they had a fixt aversion to towns as they had long after and the towns were left in possession of the old inhabitants who could hold no part in the constitution of the victors It is therefore ridicu∣lous to suppose representatives of towns In a third and last stage difference of occupations had by degrees introduced trade and trade introduced towns endued with privileges to protect it or in other words burghs These we are told were first founded in Germany in the tenth century In other countries they are later Under the Ro∣man empire there were many privileged towns but their privileges were annihilated by the con∣quest of the Goths who had brought from their woods a contempt and aversion for towns as re∣ceptacles of vice and effeminacy When in ad∣vanced society the Gothic victors allowed privi∣leged towns or burghs the nobles had great en∣mity to them and constant contests with the citi∣zens because among other privileges a slave who lived a year and day in a burgh obtained his freedom and the nobles thus lost many slaves Thus arose the first difference of interests between lords and commons for before this the former had been regarded as natural representatives of the latter Other representatives were of course ne∣cessary and were constituted accordingly  This second stage when the peers represented the commons has misled some because the privi∣leges of the commons seem to them to have slept  Mr Hume who knew nothing about Goths nor the Gothic constitution and who is so shallow that far from reaching the bottom he has not reached the bottom of the surface but merely skimmed it's top observes in his own Life that it is ridiculous to look on the English constitution as a regular plan of liberty before the death of Charles I A profound remark truly and most sagacious Is it a regular plan now Did regular plans of government ever exist save in Utopias Have not all governments save despotism been ever totally irregular While a man has life his pulse must be liable to irregularities when he is dead it is regular enough Error must attend free will and irregularity free government the more irregular the more free as in the Greek democra∣cies Strange that Mr Hume should forget his own just remark "Where any power or preroga∣tive is fully and undoubtedly established the exercise of it passes for a thing of course and readily escapes the notice of history and annals"  Essays  Vol I p This was the case with the privileges of the commons during this ob∣scurer stage Mr Hume's history stands solely upon a system and it is the only history i ever met with in which the evidences against are utterly concealed and past over as nonexistent A whig history would be as ridiculous as a tory one the only point in history is to narrate facts not to build systems for human affairs are never syste∣matic Our old historians who knew nothing of whig or tory systembuilding knew the privileges of the commons well Let us give one instance and that from the middle of that very period when the privileges of the commons are considered as asleep Roger Hoveden who wrote about says that on the death of Edwy king of the West Saxons in Edgar king of Mercia was elected by the English people king of all Eng∣land  land AB OMNI ANGLORUM POPULO ELECTUS  Rex etiam Westsaxonum Edwius quatuor annis regni sui peractis defunctus Wintoniae in novo monasterio est sepultus cujus regnum suus germanus rex Mercensium Edgarus ab omni Anglorum populo electus suscepit divisaque regna in unum copulavit  Hoveden  an p and apud  Scriptores post Bedam  Londini  fol  Hoveden thought this event so important as to mark it by many epochs  And he was the very first king of all England so that his successors must abide by his title and any other claim is that of usurpation  But to resume a more immediate consideration of my present subject i hope to have shewn from Similarity of Manners from Ancient Authorities and above all from that infallible argument Identity of Language that the whole German nations from Getia and Dacia to the extremity of Scandinavia were Scythae or Goths And every reader who has attended to the process must either deny the validity of arguments universally allowed in other cases to be incontrovertible or assent that  It is therefore Historic Truth that the ancient Ger∣mans were all Scythians or Goths  A question remains At what time the Scythic population may have reached the Rhine and Northwest extremity of Scandinavia the furthest bounds of ancient Germany Thrace Asia Mi∣nor Illyricum Greece were certainly peopled with Scythae at least years before Christ Italy at least Nations that subsist by hunting and pasturage as the barbaric Scythae require a prodigious extent of territoryto afford means of sub∣sistence and their speedy progress and population we may judge of from those of the Tartars But the German Scythae had their way to fight against the northern Celts a hardy race of men and a vast region to populate so that we may allow a very  considerable period for their progress From He∣rodotus and other ancients it is certain that the scythians possessed Germany nay had driven the Celts to the furthest west of Gaul at least years before our aera And there are reasons against placing this event at a much remoter period so that this may safely be considered as being as near the aera as possible in a case of this nature  Before closing this chapter it is proper to add a few remarks on the migrations of Scythians from Germany before the Christian epoch Caesar in∣forms us that the Belgae the greatest and most valiant part of the Gauls were Germans and Strabo confirms this account The whole  Provin∣cia Romanorum  or  Gallia Braccata  was also pos∣sessed by Germans as the name  Braccata  shews for breeches were the peculiar badge of the Scy∣thae Caesar indeed instructs us that the Celts or old Gauls were bounded by the Seine on the north and Garonne on the south The learned and judicious Schoepflin  In his  Vindiciae Celticae  Argent  to  a pamphlet which may be regarded as a model for enquiries of the kind the whole authorities are given in chronologic order and yet the work is brief as well as accurate and complete  has sufficiently shewn that the name of Celts was restricted to the Gauls alone but has unhappily forgotten that only one third part of the Gauls were Celts Hence his account of the Celtic colonies is radically errone∣ous for all these colonies were of German Gauls Indeed reason might convince us that it was im∣possible for the Celts who had been expelled and confined by the Belgae or Germans upon one side and by the Aquitani or Iberi on the other to send out colonies among those very enemies whose superior courage had vanquished them and seized a great part of their territory This could be put beyond doubt by a special examination of these colonies which tho i have ample materials for  yet i am with reluctance obliged to suppress as too large for the present design  But to give a few hints The reader must ever remember in this question that the name of  Celts  was not only given peculiarly and properly to the real Celts who in Caesar's time were confined to one third part of Gaul but was also given laxly and improperly by many ancient writers to all the Gauls For as the Celts had anciently pos∣sessed all Gaul their name was continued by some and by the distant Greek writers especially to all the Gauls tho the Belgae and Aquitani the Galli Braccati and others or the far greater part of the Gauls were not Celts but expellers of the Celts The case is the same as that of the English who are called Britons not as being old Britons but as expellers of those Britons and as living in Britain So the British of America are called Americans not as being American savages but as possessors of that country Thus the Ger∣mans who had seized on most of Gaul and had come in place of the Celts are called Gauls by the Romans and Celts by many of the Greeks and by some Romans The question always remains which Gauls are meant by the former and which Celts by the later  The Celts who passed into  Spain  were certainly of Gallia Braccata which bordered on Spain and not real old Celts who so far from sending colonies into Spain were driven from their southern territories by the Aquitani a Spanish people These  Celtiberi  and  Celtici  of Spain are the only Gaulic colonies which obtain the appellation of Celts in Roman writers who call the others Gauls A singularity which proceeded from this that the Romans received their first intelligence concerning Spain from the Greeks of Marseilles who called all the Gauls Celts and thus retained the old name by which they had found the people distinguished by the Greeks and perhaps by the Carthaginians  The Belgae of  Britain  and  Ireland  are out of all question for it is known to a certainly that the Belgae were not Celts but Germans  The Gauls of  Cisalpine Gaul  or of  Italy  were infallibly German Gauls The former region was called  Gallia Togata  for it's possessors from their neighbourhood with the civilized Etruscans and Greeks of Marseilles were the first who were civilized and abandoned their rude dress for that of their polite neighbours while their brethren further off retained the Gothic  braccae  and gave name to Gallia Braccata The Celts were remote from Cisalpine Gaul while it was surrounded by Ger∣mans on the north and by other Germans of Gallia Braccata on the west And that the Cisal∣pine Gauls were not old Celts who retained posses∣sion of the country is clear from Livy and Poly∣bius who relate their passage into Italy and the former dates it in the time of Tarquinius Priscus about the period of the foundation Marseilles by the Greeks that is about years before Christ by common accounts but by Sir Isaac Newton's rectified chronology of Rome about It is well known that the Roman history for the three or four first centuries is very uncertain because there were neither writers nor records of any kind and Livy in relating this very remote event gives it as a story of yesterday with all its circumstances which sufficiently indicates that he used poetical and fabulous liberty here as in all the ancient parts of his work Hence we need only read this tale to deny faith to it's circumstances tho the groundwork be confirmed by the grave testimony of Poly∣bius and it is beyond doubt from many concur∣ring ancients that the Cisalpine Gauls had passed into Italy at a late period and were not ancient inhabitants But Livy in composing his tale con∣cerning an event years old and of which he could have no circumstantial evidence whatever found that Polybius a Greek writer and perhaps  other Greeks of Marseilles called the Cisalpine Gauls as they did all the Gauls Celts Hence knowing also as the passage shews that the Celts of his time were but a third part of the Gauls he un∣derstood the Celts laxly so called by the Greeks to be the Celts proper and has of course formally derived the Cisalpine Gauls from the Celts proper Pelloutier draws the names given by Livy  Ambi∣gatus Bellovesus Sigovesus  from the Tudesque or German Gothic But tho such erymology is un∣certain yet the frequency of similar names among the Germans deserves notice The  Ambi  variti were a Belgic tribe  Ambi  orix was prince of the Ebu∣rones a Belgic people and the  rix  is an infalli∣bly Gothic termination common to this day Theodoric Frederic c c The  Bello  vassi were a Belgic tribe as were the  Bello  cassi  Sege  stes  Segi  merus  Segi  mundus are German names in Tacitus The manners of the Cisalpine Gauls described by Polybius II are German Diodorus Siculus distinguishes the Senones who took Rome from the Celts and calls them North∣ern Gauls They were of the  Semnones  of Germany  The Gauls who long contended with the Ger∣mans in prowess and who settled a colony or two in the south of  Germany  were German Gauls Caesar tells us that the Belgae were in continual war with the Germans as indeed the German nations were among themselves The Helvetii Boii Tectosages were German Gauls who had warred with their ancestors and settled among them The Germans of Southern Gaul being far superior in civilization to their progenitors and refined by climate neighbourhood and commerce were of course often superior in war a circumstance which might have simply arisen from better weapons The Gallic colonies in  Illyricum  and  Thrace  are of the same description Livy XL tells that the Scordisci and Taurisci were of one speech with  the Basternae and they were of course German Gauls  That famous expedition which founded the kingdom of Galatia in  Asia Minor  was also of German Gauls The people were Trocmi Tec∣tosages and Tolistoboii the leaders Lomnorius and Lutarius the later being the German name Lutharius or Lothaire Saint Jerome  In praef Epist ad Galat  puts the German extraction of the Galatians beyond doubt by telling us from personal knowlege that their speech was the same with that of Treveri or Triers in Germany where he had studied So much for the GermanGallic colonies which the bounds of my design forbid me to examine at due length  As in America the Europeans not only have vast distinct possessions but also towns and settlements among the savages such we may judge was the case with the Scythians among the Celts In celtic Gaul especially many Belgic tribes and towns may be found and it may be inferred that the Celtic parts of Britain and Ireland were in the same predicament Strabo lib IV says that the Veneti on the extreme western shore of Celtic Gaul were Belgae They were famous for naval power and resistance to Caesar whom see  The Scythians or Goths who slew Cyrus whom Alexander shunned and who were the terror of Pyrrhus  Modo autem Getae illi qui et nunc Gothi quos Alexan∣der evitandos pronunciavit Pyrrhus exhorruit c  Oros  I Part of the above paragraph is translated from Tacitus  Germanic  were in their German seats equally for∣midable Not the Samnians not the Cartha∣ginians not the mingled nations of Spain and of Gaul nor even the Parthians themselves were so dangerous to Roman power Carbo and Cassius Scaurus Aurelius and Servilius Cepio and Marcus Manlius with their five consular armies were all taken prisoners or slain by the Teutones and Cimbri who had fled from the northern Germans Julius declined the contest with the Germans Augustus weeped the fate of Varus and his legions Hardly could Drusus and  Nero and Germanicus defend this frontier of the empire for this was the whole ambition of Rome In later times they were triumphed over but not conquered Under their ancient name of Scythae or Goths they were soon by degrees to seize on the whole western empire nay to pour over the fertile coasts of Africa The Vandali whom Tacitus and Pliny found in the north of Germany were to fight with Belisarius in the plains of Numidia The Suevi were to possess the fragrant fields of Spain The Langobardi were to enjoy the orange groves of Italy The Angli whom Tacitus puts in a list of names were to give their name to a country eminent in arts and arms in wisdom and liberty  CHAPTER V  The progress of the Scythians into Scandinavia especially considered  SO much has been written by many of the most learned men whom Europe has produced upon the imaginary egression of the Scythians or Goths from Scandinavia that this part of my subject well deserves a particular investigation The Scythic or Gothic language mythology and manners have also been so much preserved in the wilds of Iceland which was colonized from Nor∣way in the Ninth century and have been so ably illustrated by the erudition of different Scandinavian antiquaries that the progress of the Scythae into Scandinavia becomes a subject extremely curious and interesting My particular view which was to illustrate the history of the Piks a people who proceeded from Norway to the north of Britain about three centuries before Christ likewise con∣curs to draw my best attention to this point upon which i hope extensive reading on the subject and sedulous and minute research will enable me to throw new lights  The reader will please to recollect that before our proofs that the Germans were Scythae the BASTERNAE attracted attention as a people situated between the Getae and the Germans But this vast race of men called Basternae not only reached down to the  Alpes Basternicae  or Carpathian moun∣tains and the Danube but also extended north to that part of the Baltic where present Prussia now  lyes and which is nearest to the Euxine the early seat of the Scythae the distance beween the Baltic and Euxine seas being only about miles little more than the breadth of the interme∣diate country of present Poland Over this tract of ground about miles long from the Danube to the Baltic and about miles broad from the western boundary of the Vistula to the Chronus and Borystenes on the east were stationed the great BASTERNIC nations For the Sarmatae were not in possession of Poland till the German nations began to move into the Roman empire and the river Nieper or Borystenes and Chronus now Niemen were the proper bounds of ancient Sar∣matia on the west The west of Poland was a gradual acquisition of the Sarmatae as the Scythae moved into the Roman empire and in the fourth and fifth centuries when the German Scythae were still moving into richer countries the Sarmatians or  Slavi  Slava  in the Slavonic means  glorious noble  hence many Polish names as Ladi  slaus  c Procopius is it is believed the first who mentions the Sclaveni  or Slavons II III in which last passage they make a great figure passing the Danube in crouds It deserves especial remark that the  Venedi  or  Wends  have been by transtators of Northern Sagas and others confounded with the  Vandali  which last are it is thought unknown to Northern writers The Vans Wends Venedi lay in Odin's supposed way from the Euxine to the Baltic the Vandals did not This strange error has got even in∣to a royal title  Gothorum et Vandalorum Rex  for  Venedorum  a ti∣tle equal to that of  Rex Maris et Terrae  seized on Pomerania and Mecklenburg on the north and Bohemia toward the south which are held by mixt Sarmatians and Germans to this day The grand distinctions between the Sarmatians and Germans as marked by the acute and transcendant mind of Tacitus toward the close of his  Germania  were that the Sarmatians lived always on horseback their families in cars or small waggons and wore flowing robes like the Parthians while the Germans fought on foot  having few cavalry and had fixt huts and a close dress but above all quite a different language He also ascribes nastiness to the Sarmatae tho of this the Germans had their share as all uncivi∣lized nations must have and the Celts in particu∣lar were so filthy that even their cleanliness was the extreme of nastiness  Strabo  lib  III p says that the Celts washed their body and cleansed their teeth with urine and that it was kept long in cisterns to give it more strength  But the Sarmatians were a great and warlike nation tho it appears from the little mention of them in Greek and Roman history that they yielded much to the Scythians in arms and from all ancient accounts were also inferior in wisdom and such rude arts as early society affords tho the peasantry of Poland and Russia be remarkably sensible and acute  The BASTERNAE in this large extent of country became so remarkable to the ancients that Strabo book VII p classes them with the enormous names of SCYTHAE and SARMATAE saying that the Scythae Basternae and Sarmatae beyond the Danube gradually emigrated north He also in∣forms us that the Basternae were divided into four great nations ATMONOI  the  Atmoni Sitones Peukini  and  Roxolani  Some of them he observes re∣mained still in Thrace and their first habitations while others moved north The Peukini tho they sent out vast emigrations form a remarkable in∣stance of those who remained Let us briefly confider the BASTERNAE of whom the Peukini were a part in order that the reader may see the progressive evidence of the ancients who have mentioned them concerning both The first mention we find of the  Basternae  in history is on account of their assisting Perseus king of Macedon against the Romans years before Christ Polybius who was cotemporary men∣tions that Perseus was assisted with  Basternae  and Gauls  Livy XL XLI misunder∣standing Polybius puts the Basternae as Gauls but says that their speech was the same with that of the Scordisci who were German Gauls Upon which Pelloutier follishly concludes them Celts quite forgetting that the Celts were not Gauls but only a people of Gaul and the most distant of all the whole German Gauls being the people gener∣ally called Gauls by the ancients and being the nearest to the scene of action and to Italy Those French authors who finding the Celts peculiarly and originally in Gaul and therefore sometimes called Gauls as we call the Welch Britons be∣cause they anciently possessed the whole country and who from thence gratify their dreams of uni∣versal dominion by wishing to prove the whole of Europe Celtic only shew an ignorance and folly beyond all excess What should we say of him who finding the Welch peculiarly called Britons and that North America was peopled from Britain should in some future period dream that all the British inhabitants of North America are Welch This is exactly the very case  To return to Perseus and the Basternae Dio∣dorus Siculus says Perseus employed  Gauls and Celts  not Basternae if the excerpt be not errone∣ous Appian  in Macedonicis  p calls these assistants of Perseus  Getae  and Dion Cassius who is indeed a contemptible and foolish writer yet as he long commanded in Pannonia was on the very confines of the southern Basternae if not among them and therefore in this one instance may deserve some credit says  lib  XXXVIII that they were  Scythae  and  lib  LI  Dion also informs us  lib  LI  p  that they lived in cars that is like their neighbours the Sarmatae but as all the ancients distinguish them from the Sarmatae and Strabo lib VII inclines to think them Ger∣mans  mans which Pliny and Tacitus  Pliny IV Tacitus in Germ Leibnitz well observes on the later 'Sed cum ipse Tacitus subjiciat Pencinos sermone referre Germanos quaestio ab ipsomet decisa est Unde enim illis sermo Germanicus nisi ab origine Germanica' Apud Tac Germ a Dithmar  p    afterward from complete information establish beyond a doubt from their speech c and Dio himself calls them Scythae and Appian Getae we must conclude that they were a vast German nation who were most retentive of the ancient Scythic manners as their neighbours the Getae people of Little Scy∣thia or Parental Scythians were The other Ger∣mans being the most distant settlement of the Scythae and bordering on the Celts who had by the Greeks of Marseilles been taught many civil arts had on the contrary advanced one stage fur∣ther in society than their Scythian ancestors as we observed before that the Greeks another Scy∣thian settlement had from still greater advantages of situation advanced even to the height of hu∣man perfection while their ancestors were in pri∣mitive barbarism We afterward in Justin XXXVIII find Mithridates solliciting their assistance against the Romans and i shall proceed to my main object their northern progress after just mentioning that in Justin XXXII we find the Basternae defeating their brethren the Daci probably from superiority in cavalry and that Dionysius who was of Corinth and wrote as Dodwell shews about the year of Christ in in his Periegesis after mentioning the Danube pouring it's five mouths around Peuké  v puts the Basternae between the Getae and Daci        Tacitus Ann ii mentions  Basternas Scythasque  The Basternae lived in cars that is their wives and chil∣dren did always whilke the men roved about on foot or on horseback and returned to their cars or little waggons at night Herodotus says the same of the Scythae IV and Justin II  Basterna  was Francic or Tudesque for a chariot perhaps covered like a waggon as we find the chariot of honour on medals of Faustina and others See Gregor Turon III the word also occurs in Lampridius  in Heliogab  Symmachus and the  Capitularia Reg Franc  and Amm Marcell lib XIV Vopiscus in Probo tells that Probus settled no less than Basternae in Thrace In the Basternae are last spoken of as a separate people  Zozim Orosius Victor Eumen Pan Const  The  Gepidae  of later ages seem the  Geloni  of the former and from their situation must have been Basternae    Strabo says that in his time the Peukini pro∣per or parental were that part of the Basternae who lived in the large ile of Peuké in the Euxine sea at the mouth of the Danube and Ptolemy remarks the same in his time and it is likely their descendants still retain their possessions in  Piczina  the modern name of Peuke Mela II calls Peuké an iland  omnium notissima et maxima  the most famous and largest in those parts The author of the  Periplus Ponti Euxini  says it equals Rhodes in size Some think it named from    picea a pine tree  because it was perhaps full of such but it seems as probably to have taken it's name from the Piki a people beyond Colchis and subject to the Colchian kingdom  c  for the antients agree that a colony from Colchis settled on the Ister in the time of the Argonauts and it is most likely that it was at its mouth For tho Apollonius Rhodius book IV and Justin xxxii make the Istri on the Adriatic that colony which by their own accounts of the Col∣chians sailing up the Danube to the Adriatic is  Pliny VI where he treats of the Palus Maeotis and nations around it puts the  Piki  between the Maeotis and Ceraunian Mountains or in present Circassia Some editions read  Phycari  but Harduin gives us  Pici  from four excellent MSS  Reg    Col    Chiffl  Mela I calls them  Phicores Phycari Phicores Pici  are but different modifica∣tions of the same name as  Pihti Phichtiaid Pihtar Peohtar  are Cumraig and Saxon names of the  Piks  Plautus  in Aulularia  calls them  Picos  a complete impossibility yet Oyid who lived at Tomi close by the spot is an undoubted witness in our favour  Solus ad egressus missus septemblicis Istri  Parrhasiae gelido virginis axe prenor  Jazyges et Colchi Metereaque turba Getaeque  Danubii mediis vix prohibentur aquis  Trist  lib II el  The  Jazyges Eneocadlae  as above shewn were a small Sarmatic nation who lived in peace and union among the Getae on the north of the Tyras acting it is likely as cavalry in their armies and it is probable it was of them that Ovid learned Sarmatic The other nations were also north of the Danube to the south of which Tomi the place of Ovid's banishment stood and the Col∣chians here mentioned were in all probability the Peukini For tho the Piki were properly one of the many Scythian tribes between Colchis and the Ceraunian mountains yet being subject to the great Colchian kingdom they were probably called Colchians as foreigners call all the natives of Bri∣tain and Ireland English But leaving this con∣jecture for it is little better to carry it's own weight with the reader i shall proceed to examine the progress of the Basternae  The  Peukini  or that Basternic nation which emigrated from Peuké seem to have in process of time transcended all the other Basternic divisions in number Insomuch that Pliny and Tacitus put the Basternae and Peukini as names of the same nation tho Strabo Ptolemy and others writing geography and of course more accurately in these points but the Peukini as only one of the divisions of Basternae The  Roxolani  Strabo put by mistake among the Basternae for it is known to a certainty from Tacitus  Hist lib    Roxolani Sarmatica gens  c and many others that they were Sarma∣tae Strabo's mistake arose from the Roxolani being the next Sarmatic nation to the Basternae  The Roxolani were Russians and that part of Poland on the west and far from Russia called Red or Black Russia took it's name from part of the Roxolani that pierced to that corner and set∣tled Of the other divisions named by Strabo the  Atmoni  if i mistake not spreading west along the Danube became the southern Basternae or those properly and absolutely so called by the ancients while the  Sitones  A part of the Sithones remained beneath the ile of Peuke on the west of the Euxine 'Ponticum litus Sithonia gens obtinet quae nato ibi Orpheo vate decus addidit nomini' Solin c Virgil has  Sithonias nives  Ovid  Sithonium aquilonem  proceeded northward with the Peukini till they arrived at the Baltic sea and Scan∣dinavia A progress which we are enabled to trace as clearly as can be expected after a remark or two on a few southern colonies of the Peukini  Ancient geographers speak of different remains of the Peukini in Thrace Such were the  Peukest    a people north of the Scordisci Pliny III tells us that Callimachus placed a people called  Peuketi  in Liburnia of Illyricum In Italy direct∣ly on the opposite shore were the  Pikeni  and further south lay the large country of  Peuketia  now Apulia of which much may be found in Stra∣bo Pliny III says it was so called from Peuketius brother of Oenotrus and Dionys Hal book p  ed Hudson  says Oenotrus and Peuketius were the two first leaders of colonies from Greece into Italy It was the custom of the Greeks always to derive names of nations from ancient kings and chiefs This was easy etymology and cost nothing yet cost as much as etymology of names is worth Thus the Lydians were from Lydus the Mysians from Mysus the Scythians from Scythes the Celts from Celtes c c c and the Aborigines of the south west shore of Italy Oenotrians from Oenotrus who led them from Arcadia and those of the east Peuketii from Peu∣ketius his brother The fact seems that these  aborigines were Oenotri from the Peloponnesus who advanced from the south west of Italy upward along the west shore while the Peuketii seized on the east side from the opposite shores of Illyricum where we learn from Callimachus that a part re∣mained The  Pikentii  on the west as they bordered on old Peuketia were as is likely of the same origin But these ideas are given as mere conjectures and i now proceed to examine the northern progress of the PEUKINI and SITONES which stands upon quite other grounds  It is allowed that the Peukini received their name and proceeded from the iland of Peuké  in the Euxine sea at the mouth of the Danube now Piczina or Pics ile This celebrated iland is finely described by Apollonius Rhodius in his exquisite poem The Argonautics written about years before Christ Thus the Peukini cer∣tainly came from the very heart of Getia Dacia and Maesia and if not originally a colony of Colchian Scythae certainly were a Scythic people issuing from the very heart of a country which was in possession of the Scythae about years before Christ Jornandes speaking of Galerius Maximinus Caesar 'Is ergo habens Gothos et Peucenos ab insula Peuce quae ostio Danubii Ponto mergenti adjacet  Marsigli in his magnificent account of the Danube does not go so far east as Peuke which is in the Turkish not the German territory  ' Zozimus calls the Peu∣kini  Peukai  Ammianus Marcellinus names them  Pikenses  lib XVII as his  Ami∣censes  seem the  Atmoni  of Strabo both above Maesia He also calls them  Peuki  lib XXII where he is speaking of Peuké The ancient author of the Argonautics ascribed to Orpheus calls the Peukini  Pacti  when he describes the Argonauts in their return sailing up some river from the Palus Maeotis to the Cronian sea as he dreams and ranges the Pacti with the Lelians Scythians Hyperboreans Ripheans  Let us now briefly consider the Northern Pro∣gress of the Sitones and Peukini two grand Bas∣ternic divisions Strabo who wrote about years after our aera is certainly well informed con∣cerning the north of Germany as the Greeks actually traded to Prussia for amber In particu∣lar the Estii of present Prussia from whose coasts the amber came and where it is yet found in such quantities as to yield a large revenue were in the confines of the Peukini and Sitones or Basternic nations on the Baltic so that the intelli∣gence concerning countries so near that to which the Greeks traded may be regarded as satisfactory Now he tells us book VII p that "most think the Basternae live beyond the Germans to the Northward others that there is only ocean" That the later opinion was false need not be told but that the former was true namely that the Basternae possessed Scandinavia is certain for Ta∣citus who was procurator of Gallia Belgica and had of course all information relating to Germany and it's neighbourhood as his admirable  Germania  shews places the SITONES whom Strabo had men∣tioned as one of the three Basternic nations in present Sweden and finds part of the PEUKINI on the opposite shore while a part no doubt had passed into Scandinavia with the Sitones their brethren And it is evident that the Sitones whom Ptolemy puts on the south of the Baltic between the Viader and Vistula were a part of the Sitones who re∣mained while the rest passed into Scandinavia for migrations of nations were seldom if ever complete a circumstance which enables us to trace their steps  The PEUKINI in particular being the largest and most eminent part of the Basternae as we may judge from their name being often extended to the whole of this vast people leave such traces behind them from Thrace to the Baltic that we can fol∣low them step by step This we are enabled to do  from the geography of Ptolemy who wrote about years after Christ As one or two Sarmatic tribes extended beyond the Chronus and Borystenes he improperly puts the Vistula as the boundary be∣tween the Germans and Sarmatae tho Tacitus who wrote about fifty years before had specially mentioned German nations beyond the Vistula and the vast people of Peukini OR Basternae in par∣ticular whom Pliny puts as one FIFTH part of the Germans But Ptolemy living at the great dis∣tance of Alexandria in Egypt and probably not even understanding Latin seems never to have redd either Pliny or Tacitus but puts his places according to the maps and Itineraries of the generals and to the Greek geographers From the later in particular who drew from the merchants of amber good intelligence as to the present rout the informa∣tion seems derived which is to be found in his chapter of Sarmatia Europaea In his time a part of the Peukini still possessed their original settlement in Peuké while we find another part far north of the Tyras and above the Getae and the  or  Peukinian Mountains  of Ptolemy are as Cluverius justly observes on the south west of present Prussia near the head of the river Bog that is within about sixty miles of the Baltic sea Ptolemy places the Peukini on the north of the Basternae so that of all the Basternae they were nearest to the Baltic And that the Peukini actually reached to the Baltic we know from Tacitus who in the end of his Germania ranges them with the Venedi and Fenni whom Ptolemy places near the Vistula upon the Baltic Tacitus also puts the  Venedi  between the PEUKINI and  Fenni  so that the Peukini must have been on the shore of the Baltic on the east side of the mouth of the Vistula or in pre∣sent Prussia from which they extended south to their Basternic brethren in the western part of present Hungary a tract about miles long and from to broad With so large possessions it is no  wonder that Pliny should put the Peukini as a fifth part of the Germans and that their name should be used as synonymous with the Basternae  Having thus shewn that the two Basternic nations of PEUKINI and SITONES extended to the Baltic and that as Tacitus and others shew and all modern geographers agree a part of the Sitones remained in the neighbourhood of the Peukini on the south side of the Baltic while the rest of the Sitones were in Scandinavia and that Strabo mentions it as the most general opinion in his time that the Basternae were beyond the Germans or in Scandinavia i believe it will be granted at once that it is most likely that a part of the Peukini went to Scandinavia with their brethren the Sitones But before insisting on this i shall give the reader some idea of what the Romans and Greeks knew of Scandinavia and the north of Germany  About years before Christ Pytheas and others as we learn from Pliny spoke of an iland called  Baltia  in the  Cronium mare  or Northern ocean whence amber was brought Herodotus had indeed mentioned this years before Christ The name of the iland was palpably from the Baltic sea very anciently so called from the Gothic or old German  Belt  a gulf Amber was never found in Scandinavia but in  Glessaria  a peninsula on the Prussian coast which afterward received it's name from the appellation which Tacitus tells the Germans gave amber namely  Gles  or  Glass  which it resembled Baltia is therefore not Scandinavia but Glessaria Pomponius Mela who wrote about years after Christ mentions the  Codanus sinus  and  Codanovia  which is in all probability present Zeeland an ile of the Suiones in which the capital of Denmark stands and from whence  Dania  is by some judged to be contracted Pliny himself who wrote about years after Christ is the first who mentions  Scandinavia  tho he tells us IV that the iles of  Scandia Dumna Bergi  and  Nerigon  had been noticed by others  He also names  Eningia  which some would rashly alter to  Finingia  but was in all likelihood the south part of Finland and taken by the ancients for another ile in the Great Northern Ocean Pliny says Scandinavia and Eningia were thought other  worlds  by the inhabitants but he uses the same extravagant hyperbole in speaking of Taprobane or  Ceylon  VI  Dumna is by Ptolemy ranged among the Orkneys Scandia may be Funen and Bergi the country of Bergen in Norway inter∣sected from Sweden on the south by the  Schager Rack  or westerly division of the Baltic so as to have to those who knew only the southern coast the ap∣pearance of an ile Pliny adds IV that Ne∣rigon was the largest of these iles and as he says he derives his information from various preceding au∣thors  sunt qui et alia prodeunt Scandiam  c it is well inferred by the northern antiquaries that Nerigon had from later and better information been put for Bergi but Pliny finding the same country called by two names thought them different iles for Nerigon is surely Norway by it's most ancient and yet indigenous name  Norigé  or the Northern kingdom But ch he tells us from himself that Scandinavia is an ile in the  Sinus Codanus  of undiscovered size and that the known parts are possessed by the  Hilleviones  in five hundred  pagi  or districts They are well thought to be of  Halland  in the southwest corner of Scandinavia  Being now come to Tacitus whose  Germania  is so important to modern history it will be proper to dwell a little upon the geography of that work which is in many points grossly misunderstood and especially that part which concerns our subject his description of the northern nations Cluverius who wrote near two centuries ago is universally and blindly followed while his faults are enormous He was a man of laudable industry but of con∣tracted and indistinct judgment If errors be ad∣mitted into any branch of science they commonly  remain for centuries owing to the indolence of mankind who are ever ready to resign their minds to any guide and would rather sleep and go wrong than examine and go right while in fact they have only to trust themselves more and others less Let us lay Tacitus before us with a map of modern Germany and put aside Cluverius Cellarius and the able D'Anville who has so often corrected their eastern geography but has trusted them with Germany their own country and thus left Europe in darkness to enlighten Asia Tacitus after em∣ploying two thirds of his work in describing the manners of the Germans passes to a description of the nations and first mentions two colonies which had returned from Gaul into Germany the  Helvetii  and  Boii  He then puts the  Vangiones  c on the west side of the Rhine and the  Batavi  in the ile formed by its outlets Beyond the people between the head of the Danube and the Rhine he places the  Catti  a large nation and further up on the the Rhine the  Uspii  c next the  Bructeri  be∣hind them the  Dulgibini  in front the  Frisii  who spred along the north bank of the Rhine and the ocean and among whom was the Zuyder Zee  ambiuntque immensos insuper lacus et Romanis classi∣bus navigatos  Tacitus adds  Hactenus in Occidentem Germaniam novimus In Septentrionem ingenti flexu re∣dit  'Thus far we know of the west of Germany It now returns to the north with a great bend' meaning that it's shore formerly west now fronts north as it does at present Friezland and Gronin∣gen Next is the very large nation of the  Chauci  then the  Cherusci  and  Fosi  the last of whom are foolishly taken for the Saxons by Cluverius who forgot that the Saxons were an alliance of many nations which like the Franks and Allmans had taken one name Here in a spot which answers to the mouth of the Elbe  proximi Oceano  dwelled the small and only remains of the Cimbri  parva nunc civitas  This  parva civitas  geographers spread over all the large peninsula of Jutland which after Ptolemy  who only puts a few Cimbri in it and no less than Six German nations they call the Cimbric Cher∣sonesus It was doubtless once inhabited by the Cimbri but they were reduced to a  parva civitas  at its southwest corner long before Roman geography commences  Tacitus next proceeds to the  Suevi  who he tells us were not one nation but many under one title who held the greatest part of Germany to wit all from the Danube to the ocean south and north and from the Elbe to the vistula east and west The first are the  Semnones  a people of a hundred districts who are rightly placed in  Brandenburg  Proceeding to the north as is clear from his expression when he passes to the Hermunduri    ut quo modo paulo ante Rhenum sic nunc Danubium sequar  for the Rhine runs north the Danube east next to the Semnones are the  Langobardi  about present Lunenburg Then follow no less than seven nations all of which Cluverius has heaped upon one another in present Mecklenburg The poor man forgot that the whole vast peninsula of Jutland was just in the road of Tacitus as his text bears that he proceeds north and that he adds  haec quidem pars Suevorum in  SECRETIORA  Germaniae  PORRIGITUR a description which can only apply to this vast and rich penin∣sula and that the Cimbri with whom he fills that large Chersonese were as Tacitus says only a small state on the ocean near the Cherusci and Fosi or at the mouth of the Elbe Seven nations are piled upon one another in a small province and a  parva civitas  is spred over a territory miles long and from to broad If this be not absurdity i know not what absurdity is But such is human science Let us place these nations as Tacitus meaned and all is well The  Reudigni  first and  Aviones  above them in present Holstein the  Angli  in Sleswick where the fertile province of Anglen spreads around Lunden it's ancient capital the  Varini  above the Angli for the river Warne is  nothing the  Eudoses  next then the  Suardones  and  Nuithones  in present North Jutland the later reaching to it's utmost point where the promontory of Scagen braves the northern ocean As to the Angli we are certain The Suardones were perhaps the  Swathedi  whom the English historians Henry of Huntingdon Roger Hoveden Matthew of West∣minster commemorate among the Danish invaders of England in the ninth and tenth centuries The Nuithones are as is likely the  Huithoni  of Ponta∣nus in his  Descriptio Daniae  that is the inhabitants of the furthest point of Jutland the Witland of Bleau's Atlas The Eudoses are the  Yeuton  or people of Yeutland as the Danes pronounce Jutland who seem to have been the largest nation holding the middle of the Chersonese and who now give a general name to the whole peninsula of Northern and Southern Jutland Let me add that it is impossible that the whole of this peninsula as nearer the Roman provinces of Upper and Lower Germany should not have been far better known to the Romans than the southern shores of the Baltic  Accordingly we find Ptolemy fifty years after Tacitus places no less than six nations in it the  Sigulones Sabelingii Cobandi Chali Phundusiii Charudes  besides the Saxons at it's south part and the Cimbri whom Ptolemy ignorantly places at it's northern extremity Ignorantly for no man can prefer Ptolemy's testimony who lived at Alexandria to that of Tacitus who lived in Bel∣gic Gaul and who expressly puts the Cimbri on the seaside of the Fosi at the mouth of the Elbe The reader need not be told that the text of Ptolemy is rightly deemed the most corrupt of all antiquity as indeed a constant series of unknown names and numbers must have been lyable to great vitia∣tions of copiers His account of the names of the German nations often differs from Tacitus yet Strabo confirms Tacitus tho he wrote before him for Strabo's work was not so lyable to vitiation  being narrative while Ptolemy's only contains geographic tables The Phundusii seem the Eudoses the Charudes the Suardones the others are yet more corrupt for those given by Tacitus can be traced in the spot and in history but of those assigned by Ptolemy not one Yet Ptole∣my places none of the nations above mentioned elsewhere save the Angili Suevi and it is doubt∣ful if these were the Angli  These  Anglii  of Ptolemy are corrupted from  Angrii  or  Angrivarii  placed by others just where Ptolemy puts the  Anglii  Tacitus observes of these nations that they are divided by rivers and woods a description most applicable to Jutland now so well wooded and intersected by fine streams Perhaps it may be said that Tacitus would have mentioned this great Chersonese expressly had he meant it but it is doubtful if it was called a Chersonese save by Ptolemy only and it's size is so great that we should as well think of calling Ptolemy's Caledonia bending to the east a Cher∣sonese of Britain Nor does Tacitus name Scandi∣navia tho he describes nations in it as shall pre∣sently be seen  Having thus proceeded to the utmost north of the west parts of Germany or those commencing from the Rhine as a boundary Tacitus passes to follow the Danube as he says or an east course and places the nations regularly one after another as Cluverius well puts them in this tract After mentioning the utmost nations this way Tacitus returns northward telling that a large chain of mountains divides Suevia that is a chain running north and south beyond which are the  Lygii  con∣sisting of many nations the chief being the  Arii Helveconae Manimi Elysii Naharvali  The Ly∣gii are rightly put by Cluverius in present Silesia Above the Lygii were the  Gotthones  rightly put in Pomerellia at the mouth of the Vistula or Weissel  Protinus deinde ab Oceano Rugii et Lemo∣vii  'next from thence on the ocean the  Rugii  ' rightly put in Rugen 'and Lemovii' whom  Cluverius makes the same with the Heruli and puts in Pomerania But the account of Tacitus bears that the Lemovii were west of the Rugii for he is coming  deinde  from the Gotthones and Lygii and Ptolemy expressly shews that three other na∣tions dwelled in present Pomerania namely the Ruticlii Sideni and Pharudini So that the Lemovii were doubtless west of the Rugii or Rugen as the text of Tacitus bears who seems to include the three other nations mentioned by Ptolemy in the general name of Gotthones and thus to extend them over Pomerania as well as Pomerellia The  Lemovii  were of course in present Lubec and Wagerlant  After this Tacitus proceeds to the Suiones  Suio∣num hinc civitates ipso in oceano  c Modern geographers following Cluverius who is by no means accurate have made the Suiones the pre∣sent Swedes and the northern antiquaries seem to allow this tho to me nothing is more doubtful  The learned Huet  Commerce des Anc  rightly saw that the  Suiones  must be on the  west  from the account of Tacitus but he errs in placing them in Norway  For the Sitones whom Tacitus puts beyond the Suiones  Suionibus Sitonum gentes continuantur  and after describing them says  hic Sueviae finis  and passes to the Peukini Venedi and Fenni seem to me infallibly the present Swedes and the name bears more resemblance to  Suitiod  the old name of Sweden Whereas Suiones resembles more  Zeewoners  or  dwellers in the sea  whence the noble and fertile iland which forms the best part of the Danish dominions is now called  Zee∣land  the  Su  appearing to be merely a Roman way of expressing the German sound of Z in Knytlinga Saga and other Icelandic books Zee∣land is called Sioland a name preserving affinity with Suiones as Suitiod the old name of Swedes and Sweden in these works does with Sitones Perhaps  Sitones  sprung from  Sictuna  the old name of the chief  civitas  in Sweden near Birca as Adam  of Bremen and others testify Add to this that only the most southern part of Scandinavia was ever known to the ancients and the vast  Wener  Lake in present Westroguland or as the Swedes affect to call it Westrogothia seems the utmost bound of their real knowlege they thinking that beyond was the  Cronium Mare  or Frozen Ocean the sea beyond the Suiones mentioned by Tacitus which was looked on as the end of the world I have perused and reperused with indefatigable and minute attention all that the ancients have said of Scandinavia and am convinced that the nar∣rower bounds we confine their knowlege of it to we shall be the nearer to the truth The Suiones after the most mature consideration appear to me infallibly the people of present Zeeland and the iles around it  civitates in oceano  and part of the Danish territory on the opposite shore of the sound now Schonen Halland and Westrogo∣thia For can any man believe that Tacitus should pass to Scandinavia and take no notice of the noble and rich iland of Zeeland and the large and fertile iles around it should fly at once as is dreamed to present Norway and Sweden of which he knew as much as he did of Greenland as every one the least verst in ancient geography must know should join all Scandinavia a coun∣try when really known as large as Germany it∣self to a few small states Was Tacitus utterly absurd or are his commentators so  After the Suiones Tacitus passes to the  Aestii  who are rashly enough from similarity of names placed in present Estonia tho Glessaria the iland of the Aestii is confessed to be in present Prussia two hundred miles southwest of Estonia and it is on the coast of Prussia alone that such quantities of amber are found to this day Estonia con∣fessedly means merely  east country  and may be a late name nothing being so common as names of countries from the points in which they lye as  Aestsexia or Essex in England c c c  In the  Periplus Wulfstani  of king Alfred published in the book of Arius  De Islandia  edit Bussaei  Hauniae    to  and elsewhere we are told 'the Vistula is a very large river and near it ly Witland and Vandalia Witland belongs to the Esti' It is hence clear that the Esti of Alfred's time were those of Tacitus on the mouth of the Vistula and far re∣mote from Estonia  The Aestii were certainly in the peninsula beyond pre∣sent Dantzic that is as Tacitus describes on the  right hand  as you sailed up the  Suevicum mare  or south part of the Baltic that was on the north of the Suevi And he mentions the Aestii before he passes to the Sitones or Swedes of the opposite shore and the Peukini Venedi and Fenni be∣yond whom he had faintly heard of a people who were covered with skins of beasts and thence went for beasts with a human face The Fenni were infallibly from the account of Tacitus that they were divided from the Peukini only by woods and hills inhabited by Venedi not the people of Finland as dreamed but the FINS a great abo∣riginal people of whom see Mr Tooke's Russia The language of Lithuania or the north of Po∣land Samogitia Courland Estonia Livonia is at this day Finnish not Slavonic The Fenni of Tacitus were in Livonia and Estonia Ptolemy book III places Fenni at the Vistula  From the Aestii Tacitus passes to the  Sitones  or Swedes of Smaland on the opposite shore and as the Suiones were unquestionably the people of present Zeeland and surrounding iles with a small part of southern Scandinavia along the west shore up to the Wener lake so the Sitones were only a very small part of the Swedes or Suitiod namely those of present Smaland and Easter Gothia Tacitus tho he appears to have redd Pliny from his copying that writer's account of the origin of amber takes no notice of Scandinavia but pal∣pably implies it to be partly inhabited by the Suiones and Sitones and is universally so under∣stood  The Hilleviones and iles mentioned by Pliny as he had procured no intelligence of he passes in silence If the reader will with these views read the work of Tacitus he will find all clear As commonly understood nothing but a confusion unknown to the luminous mind of Ta∣citus arises For he is supposed to pass from the Lemovii about Lubec up to Sweden with  Suio∣num hinc civitates  whereas Zeeland is just oppo∣site  hinc  to the Lemovii as above placed then flies back to the Estii of Prussia then flies back  toto coelo  to Norway of whose existence he knew nothing then closes a description of Norway with  bie Sueviae finis  his Suevi being but a division of Germans then flies back again to the Peukini and Venedi and Fenni nations as remote from Not∣way as the southeast is from the northwest Take his text as here stated and all is clear and accu∣rate He passes from the Lemovii about Lubec to Zeeland thence to the Aesti possessors of Glessaria an opposite peninsula then crosses the Baltic to the opposite Swedes of Smaland thence in a right line to the Peukini Venedi and Fenni Add to this that the remains of the Sitones in Ptolemy c are exactly on the coast opposite to Smaland and it is certainly more likely that they should move to the opposite shore than into Norway a country near miles off without leaving a trace behind These cogent reasons may it is believed for ever fix the Suiones in Zeeland and circling iles with Schonen Halland and Westrogothia their real  civitates in oceano  and the Sitones a part of the Suitiod or Swedes in the southeast corner of Sweden now Smaland and Eastergothia  Ptolemy who wrote about years after Christ is the last ancient worthy to be adduced con∣cerning Scandinavia for the sickly dreams of Jor∣nandes and Procopius the last of whom was so ignorant as to take Scandinavia for Thule tho Pliny and Ptolemy years before might have  told him quite the contrary shall be left to their deluded followers  Nec pueri credunt nisi qui nondum aere lavantur  Juv  Ptolemy mentions four Scandias three small perhaps Funen Zeeland and Laland and one large or Scandinavia which he describes and Agathadaemon lays down in the map as just of a size to reach to the Wener lake as Ptolemy's latitudes and longitudes ascertain  The southern part of Scandinavia is called  Skani  in the old Icelandic MSS and it is still  Scania  Hence in all ap∣pearance the Roman  Scandia  It is above mentioned that beyond this the ancients imagined there was only ocean with a few iles in it as Eningia a part of Finland Bergi Nerigon all however quite unknown to Ptolemy In the west of Ptolemy's Scandinavia are the  Chaedini  in the east the  Phavonae  and  Phiraesi  on the south the  Gutae  and  Dauciones  in the middle the  Levoni  These names must all have belonged to tribes south of the lake Wener The Gutae were surely the Gutones of Pliny the Gothones of Tacitus who had passed from the opposite shore and their country is now Eastergothia which Swedish vision∣aries imagine the Ostrogothia of the ancients and Westergothia the Visogothia tho Jornandes the god of their idolatry tells  cap  XIV that those names originated from the position of the Goths on the Pontus Euxinus or Euxine sea  Ablavius enim historicus refert quia ibi super limbum Ponti ubi eos diximus in Scythia commanere pars eorum qui orientalem plagam tenebant dicti sunt Ostrogothae re∣sidui vero Vesigothae in parte occidua Jorn de reb gest Get c  Tho Grotius seems to quote Baron Herberstein among the earliest writers for the name Gothland in Sweden yet that name is mentioned by Adam of Bremen about and it is highly probable that the  Gutae  of Ptolemy were those very people by moderns latinized Gothi The real indigenal name is  Gyllen Oestergyllen Westergyllen  But writers of the middle ages were fond of approximating old names to modern ones thus they called the Danes  Daci  Norway  Noricum  the Swedes  Suevi  and some Scandinavian writers of last century as Lyscander and Wormius call Scanen Scythia But the antiquity of the very names Ostrogothia Westrogothia if you will is out of all question Certain it is that the Ostro∣gothi and Visogothi of Roman history came not from that little corner of Sweden any more than the Franks Lombards Heruli Saxons went from Scandinavia as Scandinavian writers dream  Tantus amor patriae  But false history instead of honouring disgraces a country and it is ever seen that the most insignificant countries are the most full of false honours The Northern kingdoms need not such fame    After this we find little or nothing concerning Scandinavia till the sixth century when Jor∣nandes was to tell his fables about it knowing that it's distance prevented detection For tho he quotes Ablavius who is thought by Grotius to be one living under Constantius II about the year as mentioned by Ammianus yet it is only AFTER he describes the Goths as settled in Little Scythia and we do not even know that Ablavius was not his cotemporary and as ignorant as himself Jornandes and Procopius who wrote at the same time mention the  Danes  and  Scritfinni  or  swift Fins  which shews that the south of Finland was now known As to the other nations placed in Scandinavia by Jornandes and Procopius allow∣ing their existence they only belonged to the south parts Eginhart who wrote in the Ninth century is the first i find after the  Sitones  of Tacitus who mentions the Swedes and the Normans also began to be well known in this century when Harold Harfagre rising first sole king of Norway expelled many petry princes who with their little armies took refuge in the Orkneys and Iceland and one of them Ganga Hrolf or Rollo the Walker was after some abode in the Hebudes to found the dukedom of Normandy  Could reason account for the ideas of folly it were a matter of curiosity to enquire how Jornan∣des came to dream of all the nations in Europe proceeding from a distant and unpopulous country and to pass Germany and Getia or Little Scythia  countries overflowing with population It can only be said that the Goths coming gradually from the north into the empire it might naturally be imagined that the extreme north or Scandinavia was their point of progression tho indeed it may be suspected that a love of the marvellous and false so natural to man might be the sole spring of a fiction so opposite to common sense and to all ancient authority  Having thus shewn what the ancients knew of Scandinavia let us consider the progress of the Scythians or Goths into it We have already traced two Basternic nations the SITONES and PEUKINI up to the shores of the Baltic On these shores close by them we find the  Gotthones Guttones  or  Gythones  as called by Tacitus Pliny Ptolemy How this nation came to hold a name so near that of all the Goths were difficult to say were not the name of  Gut  or  Good  given to ground people c supposed the origin of the Scandinavian Gudske latinized Gothlandia and our Gotthones probably took their name from the same fountain if not from  Gote  a horseman for they bordered on the Basternae who like the Sar∣matae were mostly cavalry and it is likely the Gothones were laso cavalry and so called by the other Germans who had little or none We also find the Gothini a Gallic nation in the south of Germany and as Tacitus says their speech was Gallic they were probably an original Celtic tribe inhabiting a mountainous country as the map of Cluverius shews and allowed to dwell on condition of work∣ing the mines and paying heavy tribute as Tacitus says they did Their name Gothini being pro∣bably ironical  good people  Herodotus book IV places most of his Scythians in Germany The Ister or Danube he calls the largest river of Scy∣thia The Maris or Marus ran into the Ister from the country of the Agathyrsi ch His Hyperborei are in Germany for he makes their presents to Delos  come down to the Adriatic sea and thence to Do∣dona In ch he tells us that beyond the Ta∣nais are the Sarmatae and his Scythian nations are chiefly in Germany and Poland ch he places far to the north some Scythae who revolted and left the rest However this be it is certain from Pliny that the ancient Greeks extended Scythia even to the Baltic where amber was alone found and we learn from Strabo that it was the general opinion that the Basternae a Scythic di∣vision held the parts beyond the Germans or Scandinavia The Gythones or Gothones Pto∣lemy places on the Baltic shore between the Sideni or Sidones and Peukini two Basternic nations and it is most likely that the Gythones were also Basternae The Sidones or Sitones we find in the south of Sweden on the opposite coast and the Gythones or Guttones are surely the Gutae of the south of Scandinavia as put by Ptolemy who had passed over to the ground for∣merly held by the Sitones on their moving north∣east for  on  as Grotius observes is merely the old German plural which is sometimes given sometimes omitted thus Gutae Gutones Bur∣gundi Burgundiones Lugii Lugiones c c c  It is believed that no one the least versed in the subject will object that the voyage from pre∣sent Prussia to Scandinavia was too far for a people in the rudest state of society Some mo∣dern writers deny early population by sea as Ta∣citus and other ancients reject progress by land As the later forgot that men have feet so the former forget that they have hands Sea far from checking intercourse makes it easier even to barbarians Wherever men are found canoes are found even when huts nay cloths are want∣ing The Greenlanders and Fins navigate hun∣dreds of miles and no nation however savage has been discovered in any maritime corner of the  globe that was a stranger to navigation In the South Seas Captain Cook found small iles miles from each other peopled by the same race of men speaking the same tongue  We do not find any traces in Ptolemy or else∣where of any nations passing from the west of Germany into Scandinavia except perhaps the  Levoni  of Ptolemy's Scandinavia be the  Lemovii  of Tacitus in Lubec and Wagerland where the passage to Scandinavia is very easy But from the east to which the Scythic progress was nearer and speedier we find the Gutae and Sitones had passed and Strabo expresses it the general opinion that the Basternae held Scandinavia These circum∣stances seem to evince as clearly as the case will bear that Scandinavia was peopled by the Basternic nations on the east of Germany and as their pro∣gress was as near from Little Scythia the  punctum saliens  to the extremity of Scandinavia as was that of their brethren to the extremity of Germany so there is every reason to conclude that Scandina∣via was peopled with Scythians as soon as Germany The Northern Fins including Laplanders seem to have been infallibly aborigines of their country for they are so weak so peaceable and their soil so wretched that they could have vanquished no nation and no nation could envy them their pos∣sessions  in climes beyond the solar road  As we thus find that the Basternae or those Ger∣mans who lived east of the Vistula were the Scythic division that peopled Scandinavia it can hardly be supposed that the Peukini whose name is put by Tacitus as synonymous with Basternae and whom we have traced up to the very shore opposite to Scandinavia should have sent no colonies into it On the contrary we have every reason to believe that they were the first Scythians who passed into it and moving on in constant progress left room for their brethren the Sitones to follow for we find the steps of the Peukini in Ptolemy from Peuké to the Tyras from thence to the Peukinian  Mountains in Prussia  Paulus Diaconus I mentions that when the Lom∣bards came to  Mauringa  they encountered the  AE Pitti  or No∣ble Pitti for so  As  implies in Gothic  in a direct line while the Sitones moved round by the westward for in Ptolemy we find remains of them above the Quadi in the southeast of Germany and others still further northwest on the Baltic shore The Peukini on the contrary never crossed the Vis∣tula but proceeded strait on to the Baltic shore There they vanish while the Sitones are found in Scandinavia on the opposite coast which it is surely reasonable to infer arose from the progress of the Peukini leaving that possession open to the nation whose population followed them For as Strabo oserves the general opinion that the Basternae possessed Scandinavia and the Peukini were the largest and noblest name of the Basternae it seems likely that Strabo should especially refer to them seeing that we can trace them to the opposite coast in such full population as to leave their name to a chain of mountains and that we know the Sitones another Basternic di∣vision whose progress was infinitely slower as more circulative held a great part of southern Scandinavia These reasons appear to me so clear and cogent as fully to confirm the opinion of the ancients as related by Strabo that the Basternic Germans peopled Scandinavia and also to infer from every ground of cool probability that the  Peukini  were the very first Basternae who passed over and proceeded northwest till they emerged under the name of  Picti  the  Pehtar  or  Peohtar  or  Pihtar  of the Saxon Chronicle  Pehiti  of Witichind and  Pehts  of ancient Scotish poets and modern natives of Scotland and the north of England  It is therefore Historic Truth that those German Scythians who peopled Scandinavia were the Peu∣kini and Sitones two divisions of the Baslernae  Before adding a hint or two on the Piks who are reserved for my  Enquiry into Scotish history prior to  i must remark that i do not build on the above progress of the Peukini as it is sufficient for me to shew from Tacitus and Beda that the Piks were German Scythians from Scandinavia and to trace them from Norway to Scotland Facts and authorities which are facts in history are the sole grounds upon which a rational historian can proceed If he contradicts facts and authori∣ties he writes romance not history In my laborious research into early Scotish history i was shocked to find that instead of a foundation i had not even good ground for a foundation owing to the carelessness with which the origin of nations has been treated The toil it has cost me to drain my ground of much watry falsehood has been equal to that of building my fabric as the reader may judge I can safely say the truth has been my sole object for my labour has been too great to waste any part of it in a bauble of an hypo∣thesis which falls at the first breath while truth remains for ever To proceed to a hint on the Piks it was not to be supposed that the Northern historians could be ignorant of a nation once so celebrated and who proceeded from Norway Accordingly we find the vast history of Norway by Torfaeus compiled from Icelandic Sagas c quite full of them but under a variation in the initial letter the cause of which must be explained  Grammarians observe certain letters which are called  labial  because pronounced by the lips they are  b f m p v  of these the  b f p v  put at the beginning of words are pronounced almost with the same motion of the lips and are thus often interchanged In Roman inscrip∣tions we find  Bita  for  Vita  in Greek authors  Biturius  for  Viturius  c c c In Spanish V is pronounced B The F or Greek digamma was pronounced V as all know But the inter∣change  change of  P  and  V  which alone concerns my present investigation seems peculiar to the Germans and Northern nations of Denmark Norway and Sweden for i cannot trace it in Italian Spanish or French Thus the Germans say  Vater  for the Latin  Pater Picker  is Icelandic for a shipbuilder from  Vig a ship  c c The Saxons found the sound of P and V so similar that they actually adopted the Roman letter P to ex∣press V and W a modification of V Thus on coins of William I and II of England PILEM is WILEM and the same occurs in the earliest Saxon coins and MSS and in the printed Saxon at this day as all know Torfaeus observes in his  Series Regum Daniae  that the  Vitta  of the Saxon genealo∣gists is the  Pitta  of the Icelandic I need not produce more instances but refer the reader if he wishes for more to the  Glossarium Germanicum  of Wachter the  Glossarium SuioGothicum  should be  SuitoGothicum  of Ihre and the  Lexicon Islandicum  of Andreas The physical reason of the Northern nations using V for P or pronouncing P as V may be that the cold contracts their organs for V is only a less open pronounciation of P  But in the present instance there is no occa∣sion to insist on labial changes but barely to men∣tion that in the Icelandic or Old Scandinavian language there is in fact no such letter as P and in words of foreign extract the P is always pro∣nounced V and is from that cause generally so written Thus  papa  a priest is often written  pava  In present Icelandic P is always founded V  Of the ancient kingdom of VIKA  Perhaps it may be thought that the kingdom  Vik  was so called from  Vik a haven  But Torsaeus and Olaus call it  Vicha  as often as Vik and the former does not imply a haven Nor could all the south of Norway receive so vague a name as  The Haven  It is a proper name as distinct from  Vik  a haven as  Scot  is from  scot and lot  Skot  vectigal  Isl  Verelius in his  Index Ling S  yth  Scand  says  Piaekhur  is  cir∣cumcursitator  'a wanderer' The  Peukini  Basternae were such compared to the Germans and this may be the origin of the name  Torfaeus is  full and it is the  Vichia regnum  of Olaus Magnus which he puts in the list of the most impor∣tant kingdoms of Scandinavia Its inhabitants were called VIKVERAR  men of Vik  the  Pihtar  of the Saxons It was one of the kingdoms which was reduced by Harold Harfagre in the ninth century when he became first king of all Norway It extended as Torfaeus informs us from the Icelandic writers all over the south of Norway around Opsloa an ancient city near the new town Christiania and opposite the point of the Cimbric Chersonese It was afterward the large province of  Dalvika  and its east side is still known in every map by the name of  Viksiden  or the side of Vika extending down to the northwest outlet of the lake Wener But of this more elsewhere It shall only be observed in passing that this must have been the very progress of the Peukini if they preceded the Sitones a part of whose tribes lay con∣tinuous with the Suiones near the Wener lake tho had i formed an hypothesis i should have as∣sented to Cluverius and all the modern geogra∣phers who place the Sitones in Norway as in that case to suppose the Peukini their Basternic brethren in the south of the same country would have been more plausible But as facts are the sole subject of my research i shall leave hypo∣thesis to those who do not grudge to labour in vain for an hypothesis only stands till another cancels it while facts and authorities can never be overcome  It may be proper before concluding briefly to consider the received opinions concerning the Scan∣dinavian origins Saxo Grammaticus has founded the Danish monarchy in the person of a king Dan more than a thousand years before Christ Tor∣faeus from Icelandic Sagas has shewn that Saxo's  system drawn from old songs is false and that Skiold son of Odin was the first king of Denmark a little before our aera Mallet has in his history of Denmark followed the plan of Torfaeus and as it is much more rational than Saxo's it promises to stand as to succession of kings Torfaeus founding on the sole authorities which remain and it is not to be supposed that any future historian should be so frantic as to con∣tend against his authorities or that the public should approve such delusion In Sweden the tales of Joannes Magnus the forger have for a century been in utter contempt and the history rests upon an author of wonderful merit and judg∣ment for his age Snorro Sturleson who wrote in the thirteenth century and whose history extends to two folio volumes and also relates to Denmark and Norway It is in the Icelandic tongue but a Latin translation is given by Peringskiold He makes Odin cotemporary with Pompey from whom he flies into the north and subduing Scandinavia keeps Sweden for himself and com∣mences the line of kings The Norwegian history rests on the diligence of Torfaeus who from Ice∣landic chronicles genealogies c concludes Odin to have come to Scandinavia in the time of Darius Hystaspis or about years before Christ Some Northern antiquaries also finding in the Edda that Odin was put as the supreme deity and that a total uncertainty about his age prevailed in the old accounts have imagined to themselves another Odin who lived about years before our aera a mere arbitrary date and which the formers of this system had better have put years before Christ as Torfaeus the most diligent of Northern antiquaries has done Mallet who has taken matters as he found them supposes two Odins and looks on the last who flourished in Pompey's time as an Asiatic Magician nay he tells us some believe three Odins Torfaeus we have seen in  his Norwegian history infers him to have lived years before Christ whom in his  Series Regum Daniae  he had thought lived only  O caecas hominum mentes O pectora caeca  Here is the secret ODIN NEVER EXISTED The whole affair is an allegory Torfaeus so pro∣foundly versed in the Icelandic monuments tells us they abound in allegory insomuch that it is often impossible to distinguish truth from falsehood in them Strange that he did not see that they all begin with allegorv Not one of these Icelandic pieces nor any monument whatever of Scandina∣vian history is older than the Eleventh century What dependence then as to events happening be∣fore Christ Their chronology down to Harold Harfagre or the end of the ninth century is also quite confused insomuch that you will find one man cotemporary to three or four centuries  The Later Edda which was also compiled by Snorro in the thirteenth century fully confirms the idea that Odin was never in life but was merely the God of War In this Edda Thor is the son of Odin Mallet well observes that thro this whole Edda Odin the hero who led the Goths from Asia is confounded with Odin the God of War or supreme god of the Norwegians True yet is there no confusion There was but one Odin the god The hero is a nonexistence The whole progress of the Goths from Asia under Odin is so palpable and direct an allegory that he must have little penetration indeed who cannot pierce it It was the God of War who conducted the Goths literally they fought their way against the Celts and Fins But it may be said how then came Snorro for on him the whole rests to make Odin cotemporary with Pompey Be it observed on this that Snorro lived at a late period the end of the Thirteenth century and that not an iota about Pompey could occur till Christianity introduced  Latin Learning in the th age The fact is merely this Snorro found even from his strange genealogy that the earliest kings of Denmark Sweden and Norway of whom tradition preserved the names could not be dated further back than about years before Christ These kings as usual with even Greek and Roman genealogists when the name of their fathers was unknown to tradition were called sons of some God and in the present case Odin the  Alfader  and the Mars was the common sire Snorro who as appears from his work was considerably tinctured with Latin learning never reflected that Odin could be only an allegorical father but simply believes him a real human father and finding his epoch according to his foolish genealogy of Kings cor∣respond in this view with that of Pompey thinks it a proper place to display his Latin by connecting his history with the Roman His work is divided into various Sagas or historic romances and as the Icelanders had Sagas on Alexander the Great on Arthur on Troy c it is likely they had one on Pompey in which as all chronology was confounded in these romances Odin was brought in as fighting with him Snorro probably had this saga before him and so gives the tale But to shew how very little Snorro can be relied on we have only to reflect that in the preface to the Edda he makes Thor the founder of Troy and Odin his descendant in the th generation that is allowing years as usual for a generation Odin lived years after  Thor  whom he makes  Tros  from mere similarity of names Now Tros lived as chronologers mark years before Christ of course Odin lived years before Christ and yet was cotemporary to Pompey No wonder that three Odins were necessary In truth chronology as might be ex∣pected is utterly confounded in those romances called Sagas insomuch that Torfaeus once placed  King Hrolf Krak years before Christ and was afterward forced to put him years after Christ The story of Odin flying from Pompey is a mere dream of some silly Saga and he who builds on it must be weaker than a child Such an event as the migration of a whole nation from the Euxine to the Baltic could never escape the Greeks who had numerous colonies on the Euxine and who traded to the Baltic for amber It is however remarkable that all Scandinavian Sagas mention Odin with his Scythians coming to Scandinavia but not one hints that a single colony went from it to Scvthia which is another argu∣ment against the Goths proceeding from Scandi∣navia  If the Northern antiquaries will therefore open their eyes and see at last that all concerning Odin is a mere mythologic allegory they will do well There was but one Odin the God of War who was cotemporary in all ages The kings of Sweden Denmark and Norway nay the whole AngloSaxon kings owned him as first father That is they were entitled solely to martial prowess for their thrones As for the genealogy of Odin himself in which we find him descended from a line of ancestors as  Geta  or the father of the Getae and  Pitta  or the father of the Piks c it is also allegorical as much as the Theogonia of Hesiod and the genealogies of Greek gods and heroes Mere poetry all and not history Odin's progress as marked from the Northern histories by Mallet in his fourth chapter of the Introduction was round by Germany the Cimbric Chersonese and Denmark into Sweden How could Mallet be so much asleep as to dream that this event which according to him happened in Caesar's time could be unknown to Caesar That Odin should pierce thro all the hundred martial nations of Ger∣many and not leave a trace behind Should vanquish the Suevi to whom as their neighbours  said the Gods were not equal One is sick of such folly and to confute it is to debase the hu∣man mind The whole is unchronologic allegory The Goths by war subdued and peopled Scandina∣via an event that happened at least years be∣fore Christ and was accomplished by different nations under different leaders but all under the guidance of Odin the god of war Varro marks three divisions of antiquity the  dark  the  mythologic  the  historic  The Northern antiquaries to this day when such great writers as Schoening Suhm the illustrious patron of Danish literature Lagerbring the most acute Swedish historian rank among them still confound the  mythologic  with the  historic  period Odin is wholly a mythologic personage and has nothing to do with history which only faintly dawns at the reigns of his re∣puted sons as the Roman does with Romulus son of Mars The tales about him and his Asae are all poetical allegories and have no more to do with history than Greek mythology If he ever existed it was in the first Scythian empire years before Christ Romulus was the son of Mars as the Northern kings of Odin but no writer has been so foolish as to infer that Mars was the human father of Romulus and reigned in Latium just before him The great good sense of the Scandinavian antiquaries has already led them to laugh at Jornandes but one or two still dream of a migration of Goths to Scandinavia under one Odin about years before Christ a second from it to Getia about years before Christ and a return under another Odin years before Christ So hard it is to eradicate prejudice  A philosophic dissertation on Scandinavian Chronology is wanted but philosophy has not yet reached Scandinavia and it's best writers are full of their domestic tales but strangers to Greek and Roman learning and to the general history of ancient Europe Their histories bear only kings  one more or less from years before Christ to Ragnar Lodbrog who flourished as appears from Old English writers and other certain ac∣counts in But in the series of Irish Pikish and Heptarchic kings of England the kings reign but eleven years each at a medium and Sir Isaac Newton has shewn that even in civilized kingdoms they reign but eighteen Scandinavia was certainly more ferocious than most other countries and it's kings must have reigned a shorter and not a longer time than the kings in England Scotland and Ireland accordingly most of the early Swedish and Danish kings die violent deaths Not more than eleven years can be allowed to each reign and years reckoned back from give the year of Christ for the commencement of the series and period of the mock Odin The gene∣rations can never be computed by reigns of kings All history refuses this Who can believe that the sons regularly succeeded their fathers and formed generations by reigns Snorro c are in this respect more fabulous than Saxo The generations are false tho the names may be genuine But even fable ought to bear verisimilitude and from the year to should be placed the Fabulous part of Danish Swedish Norwegian history All before is dark and lost even to fable The total silence of their writers concerning the progress of the Jutes and Angles to England confirms this date as well as the most certain rules of chronology  Epochs of the First Gothic Progress over Europe  ANCIENT Chronology has been ruined by at∣tempting to force it to Scripture which is surely no canon of chronology for the Septuagint translated from MSS far more ancient than any we have differs from the present Hebrew no less than years before Noah and from Noah to Abraham The Greek Church certainly as well instructed as the Roman dates the creation years before Christ Epiphanius Augustin and other fathers follow the Hebrew of their time which agrees with the Septuagint But Ancient Chronology ought only to be estimated from ancient authors and kept quite apart from scriptural chronology The date of the creation c can never be decided either from scripture or otherwise and such speculations are futile In other points the authority of the learned Usher now universally allowed the best chronologer is followed  In adjusting ancient chronology it must ever be re∣membered that in tradition as in common memory GREAT EVENTS tho very remote are from the deep im∣pression they make apt to be blended with small recent incidents Thus the first Scythic Empire the victories of Sesostris c were great events preserved in the memory of many generations but in the historic page these great ancient events appear crouded and imme∣diately precede lesser incidents which happened but eight centuries or so before our aera So in old age any affecting incident of childhood appears but of yes∣terday while all the intermediate passages of youth and maturity have perished Tradition like memory preserves Great matters and Late matters in the same vivid manner the former because they have made deep impression the later because the impression is recent  The first

beyond the Danube was more permanent for  years After Christ he subdued Dacia and erected it into a Roman province bounded on the north by the Tyras or Neister on the west by the Tibiscus or Teyss on the south by the Danube and on the east by the Euxine and peopled it wholly with Roman subjects being a space about miles in circumference but which seems to have been diminished by incursions of the Daci and Sarmatae even so early as the time of Hadrian The pillar of Trajan at Rome represents this conquest  Marcus Antoninus repells the Quadi and Mar∣comanni  The Pillar of An  oninus is that of Pius and only has an en∣gra  ed base of an apotheosis and trophies Vigno  ii Columna Ant  nini Pii  Romoe      These transactions are the chief we find in Roman history relating to the Goths or Germans till the grand aera following  The Getae or Parental Goths pass the Tyras or Neister into the province of Dacia and ravaging it march on south over the Danube into Thrace These Goths did not come originally from Scandinavia as most foolishly inferred from Jornandes who says no such thing but that the ancient Scythians or Goths came from Scandinavia and afterward conquered Asia and Vexores king of Egypt events that happened about years before Christ This ridiculous and absurd tale of Jornandes tho narrated with such palpable hues of sable as cannot impose on a child and tho utterly contradicted by the consent of all the ancients as  shewn above in the second chapter of this essay has yet misled all the greatest authors of Europe to this hour The fact is that these Goths who now poured into Da∣cia were the Getae a people whom Darius found in the very country whence they now issued years before Christ as Herodotus shews They were as above fully explained the same with the Scythae as Jornandes also knew and that the Scythae came from the southern parts of Asia the reader has seen by the consent of all antiquity Soon after we find the Getae or Goths laterly so called divided into  Ostrogoths  or  EasternGetoe  and  Vesigoths  or  WesternGetoe  The royalty of the Ostrogoths was as Jornandes shews ch in the family of the  Amal    and the neighbouring Scythic na∣tions of the  Alani  c c were generally subject to the Ostrogoths West of the Boristenes were the  Vesigoths  anciently the Tyragetae stretching westward even to the Basternae another tract of vast extent The royalty of the Vesigoths was in the family of the  Balthi  or  Baldi  Jorn ch The progress of these two vast nations of Ostrogoths and Vesigoths will be shewn in the sequel These Goths who poured into Dacia A D were palpably the Vesigoths or WesternGetae for the Ostrogoths were remote from the Roman empire  Decius is defeated and slain in Maesia by the Vesigoths or Western Getae  Gallus purchases peace of the Goths by an an∣nual tribute They return to their own country  About The  Chauci Cherusci  and  C  tti  including the smaller nations  B  ucteri Usipii Tencteri Sali  Ansivarit Chamavi Dulgibin  Chassuarii Angrivarii  great nations of Germany form a grand alliance under the name of FRANCI or  reemen and bursting thro Gaul ravage Spain and a part even passes into Africa All the above nations are especially named by various ancients as members of the Franci see Cluver Germ Ant lib III where the authorities are produced  About the same time the  A amanni  invade Italy and re∣turn laden with spoil This people consisted of several tribes of the vast German nation of the Suevi whocoalescing took the name of  All men  or men of all tribes as authors relate Tho it seems likely the name rather implied their supreme courage as  who  e men  full of virility  About the same time the Goths seize on the small king∣dom of the Bosphorus Cimmerius which had long sub∣sisted under Roman protection As this petty kingdom was on the south point of the dominions of the Ostrogoths while the Vesigoths were at a great distance there is every reason to believe that the former are meant After this they in one naval expedition take Trebisond and ravage the Euxine shores in a second moving westward plunder Bithynia and in a third ravage Greece  The Goths with another naval armament land in Macedonia Claudius the emperor advancing a great battle was fought at Naissus in Dardania and Claudius conquering obtained the surname of  Gothicus  About Aurelian is forced to yield to the Goths the province of Dacia The Vesigoths who extended all over the north and west of Dacia are implied  About the same time the Alamanni invading Italy are defeated by Aurelian  The Alani invading Pontus are defeated by Tacitus  Probus builds a wall from the Rhine to the Danube about miles to protect the empire from the German nations  The Western Goths no longer content with Dacia pour into Illyricum Constantine I repells them  The Vandals who finding Germany open by the frequent transitions of the Franks and Alamanni southwest had gradually spred a part of their nation southeast till it bordered on the Vesigoths have many conflicts with the latter people Constantine I again repells the Goths and conquers a few Sarmatians  The Franks and Alamanni pass the Rhine and ravage Gaul Julian conquers and repells them  The Alamanni again invade Gaul and are de∣feated  Ulphilas bishop of those Goths who had for∣merly been allowed by Constantine II  Philostorg  lib II to settle in Maesia translates the scriptures into Gothic a part of which translation yet remains Before the year  most of the Gothic nations in the Roman em∣pire and on its frontiers became Christians  The Burgundians a  andalic race who ap∣p  red under this name on the southwest of Germany  ce invade Gaul  About the same time the Saxons also of Vandalic origin and whom Ptolemy first mentions on the mouth of the Elbe ravage the seacoasts of Gaul and Britain  About this time also the Piks a GermanGothic people of Scandinavia who had settled in present Scot∣land about three centuries before Christ ravage the north of Britain as indeed Eumenius the panegyrist says they had been accustomed to do before the time of Julius Caesar Theodosius the general of Valenti∣nian found the Piks and their confederates the Scots advanced even to London whence he repelled them and driving the Piks to their ancient possessions beyond the Clyde and Forth gained the province which he called Valentia  About the same time the great Hermanric king of the Ostrogoths or Eastern Getae and chief of the race of the Amali extended his conquests so far and wide that Jor∣nandes compares him to Alexander The Vesigothic kings were reduced to take the titles of Judges The Heruli and the Venedi of Poland and the Aestii of Prussia with many other nations were all subdued by him  About the HUNS burst at once from Tartary upon the dominions of the Alani and Ostrogoths As the appearance of this new people forms the greatest phaenomenon in the history of Europe it will be pro∣per to dwell a little on it M de Guignes has from his knowlege of the Chinese tongue obliged the world with a complete history of the Huns in four large volumes tho unhappily full of errors because M de G was not skilled in Greek and Roman history and geography The Huns are the Hiongnou of the Chinese and their own Tartars and originated from the north of China Their wars with the Chinese can be traced back to years before our aera About years before Christ the Chinese obtained a prodigious victory over them The vast Hunnic nations after this fell into civil wars In process of time the numerous hordes that were vanquished moved west in two divisions one division settled on the confines of Persia the other passed north west over the vast river Volga and poured into Europe in amazing numbers which no valour could withstand They first encountered the Alani whom they overpowered but admitted as allies They  and the other Gothic nations who even to the Cale∣donian woods of the Piks were of large limbs ele∣gant and blooming features and light hair were aston∣ished at the very forms of these new invaders di∣stinguished by squat limbs flat noses broad faces and small black eyes dark hair with little or no beard as are indeed the present Tartars The Ostrogoths yielded to the Hunnic swarms and were admitted allies on con∣dition of fighting in their armies  The Huns now commanded by Balamir as they were afterward by three others before the famous Attila next entered the Vesigothic territory The Vesigoths seeing all resistance would be vain against such myriads were forced to implore the protection of the emperor Valens who with more generosity than policy allowed them settlements south of the Danube Upon which near a million of the Vesigoths including wives and children passed into the Roman territory of Maesia A remnant of the Ostrogoths also followed The Goths being denied provisions revolt  The Goths penetrate into Thrace  On the th of August was fought the famous battle of Hadrianople in which Valens was defeated and slain by the Goths Ammianus says it was another Cannae But the Goths falling into intestine divisions were in the course of a dozen years repelled to Panno∣nia and a colony of the Vesigoths was settled in Thrace while a few Ostrogoths were placed in Lydia and Phrygia An army of Goths was retained for defence of the empire and are remarkable in the Byzantine writers by the name of  foederati  During the rest of the reign of Balamir and those of his three successors Octar Roas and Bleda the Huns rested satisfied with the territory they had gained which extended to present Hungary and Attila did not reign till or about years after this Vast numbers of the Goths seem to have ravaged and seized on the pro∣vinces from the south west of Germany and Illyricum to Macedon  The Goths unanimously rise under the com∣mand of the great Alaric  Alaric ravages Greece  He is chosen king of the Vesigoths The Ostrogoths remained in the Hunnic territory as allies  Alaric invades Italy and is defeated by Stilicho who was himself a Vandalic Goth  Radagaisus at the head of a large army of Ger∣man nations Vandals Suevi and Burgundians and Gothic auxiliaries invades Italy He is likewise de∣feated by Stilicho The remains of his army ravage Gaul  Alaric invades Italy Rome is thrice besieged and at length pillaged by him in The moderation of the Goths is highly praised by several cotemporary writers The monuments of art suffered not from them but from time and barbarous pontiss In Alaric dies  Ataulphus brother in law of Alaric and his elected successor makes peace with the Romans and marches into the south of Gaul which the Vesigoths possess for a long time  The Suevi Vandals and Alani having in penetrated from the southwest of Germany into Gaul which they ravaged were afterward by Constan∣tine brother in law of Honorius forced to abandon Gaul and pass into Spain Ataulphus king of the Vesigoths now led his forces against them The Vesi∣goths in three years conquer the invaders and restore Spain to the Romans The Suevi and Vandals how∣ever still retained Gallicia The Vesigoths hold Aqui∣tain  The Franks Burgundians and Vesigoths obtain a permanent seat and dominion in Gaul The first in Belgic Gaul on the north the second in the Provincia Lugdunensis and present Burgundy in the middle the last in Narbonne and Aquitain on the south  The Vandals of Spain pass into Africa under Genseric their king and establish the Vandalic king∣dom of Africa whch under Genseric Ungeric Gun∣dabund Thrasamund Hilderic and Gilimer lasted till when Gilimer was vanquished by Belifarius and the Vandalic empire ceased in Africa after years of duration  The great Attila king of the Huns begins to reign about this time His chief fame sprung from the terror he spred into the Roman empire his conquests have been ridiculously magnified On the authority of a vague expression of Jornandes  solus Scythica et Ger∣manica  regna possedit  In like manner Eusebius in Chron says that Constantine I conquered  all Scythia  And Jornand c of Hermanric 'om∣mbusque Scythiae et Germaniae nationibus ac si propriis laboribus in peravit' It is from detail and not from vague expressions we mast judge of history  some hints of Priscus and the exaggerations of eastern writers repeated by M de Guignes it is said that his power extended over all Germany even into Scandinavia But no German or Scandinavian author or antiquary shews a single trace of this and we know it to be false from the names of the nations who followed Attila's standard On the east the Ostrogoths obeyed him and the Gepidae whose king Ardaric was his faithfull counsellor and the Heruli On the west the Rugii and Thuringi are the only nations we find under his banner at Chalons where his whole force was assembled and they both moved south long before and bordered on Bohemia and Hungary Attila's domains were vast but he turned with scorn from the barren north while the south afforded every temptation and we read of none of his conquests to the north The cool historian will therefore reject the hyperboles of fancy and fear and contract Attila's power in Germany to very narrow bounds The palace and royal village of Attila described by Priscus and Jornandes stood between the Danube and the Teyss in the plains of upper Hungary and he chose that spot that he might overrun the Romans and command the south west provinces of the empire  At this time Theodoric reigned over the Vesigoths in Gaul and Clodion the first king in real history over the Franks of Pharamond no authentic trace can be found  The Vitae or Jutes arrive in Britain Mr Gib∣bon is certainly right that they were not invited as dreamed but were northern rovers allowed to settle in Kent on condition of lending assistance against the Piks and Scots The weak manner in which the an∣cient history of England has been treated while by the labours of many learned men that of France and Ger∣many is clear as day has left confusion every where The acquisitions of the Jutes Saxons Angli are all huddled together by our superficial dablers The  Jutes  seized a corner of Kent in they encreased and founded the kingdom of Kent about In the first  Saxons  arrived and founded the kingdom of South  Saxons In the West Saxons arrived The East Saxons in Hitherto there were no Angli in Bri∣tain The first  Angli  who arrived came under Ida to Bornicia in The East Angles do not appear till Mercia which Beda says was an Anglic kingdom but seems to me a Frisian as we know that the Frisi were of the nations who seized Britain tho omitted by Beda who was an Anglus and gives that name most improperly Mercia was founded in Let me also observe on this great event that the ideas received into English history concerning it are in some other respects mistaken The Belgic Britons as Germans infallibly used the same tongue with their new allies The Welsh were even in the time of Julius confined to Wales and the north they are his  indigenes  The Welsh usurp all the Belgic kings with whom they have no more to do than with the English From Cunobe∣linus to Vortiger not a prince can be given to the Welch The Belgic Britons no doubt amounted to three or four millions all of whom were incorporated with their allies who by all accounts were not numer∣ous tho warlike The Belgae were the Villani and slaves of the conquerors and exceeding them in number their speech must have prevailed as happened in Spain Italy and Gaul where the  lingua rustica Romana  ob∣tained Our old language should be called AngloBelgic not AngloSaxon They who look on the Welch as the only speech of the ancient Britons are widely mistaken they were called Britons as being the  indigenes  while the Belgic name was lost in the heptar∣chic states The Welch and Irish tongues preserve that soul of language the grammar but are so mixt with Gothic or German and Latin that Ihre not knowing the vast difference of the grammar pronounces what we call Celtic a dialect of the Gothic In Gothic we have a monument of the fourth century the gospels of Ulphila a book in which the meaning of every word is sacred and marked In Celtic we have no remain older than the eleventh century and the interpretation is dubious The Belgae commanded both in Britain and Ireland and being a later and far superior people im∣parted innumerable words to the Celtic They there∣fore who derive any English words from Celtic only shew a risible ignorance for the truth is that the Celtic are derived from the English  Attila invades Gaul and besieges Orleans The grand battle of Chalons the  campi Catalaunici  is fought This conflict the most prodigious and im∣portant ever joined in Europe in any age was between Attila with his innumerable army of Huns Gepidae Ostrogoths Rugii Thuringi and on the other side Aetius with Romans Theodoric with Vesigoths the Alani Saxons Franks Burgundians Armoricans c Attila is totally defeated and forced to retreat leaving of his army on the field at the smallest compu∣tation Had he conquered all Europe would now have been Hunnish or Turkish instead of Scythic or Gothic and from the polygamy c of the Huns inimical to the Christian faith it is likely divine causes apart we had all been Mahometans So much may depend on one hour  Attila returns upon Italy but spares Rome He is again defeated by Torismond king of the Vesi∣goths Jornandes ch He dies next year and his vast empire being divided among his discordant sons falls at once like a meteor that passes over half the globe then in an instant vanishes for ever  Ardaric king of the Ostrogoths assisted by the Gepidae defeats the Huns whom he had abandoned in Pannonia The Gepidae under Arcadic seize the palace of Attila and all Dacia All Illyricum falls to the Ostrogoths The remainder of the European Huns was but very small see Jorn ch and afterward nearly extinguished by the Igours of Siberia In Hun∣gary there is not one Hun tho the name  Hunnivar  Jorn c arose from the Huns The Hungaric language is Finnish and the Hungarians proper are Igours a Finnish people who settled there in the Ninth century See De Guignes Peyssonnel c  Genseric king of the African Vandals takes Rome  Theodoric king of the Vesigoths defeats the Suevi in Spain  Euric successor of Theodoric makes conquests in the northwest of Gaul He subdues all Spain save Gallicia which the Suevi held and thus begins the Gothic empire in Spain which lasted till when the Moors conquered the Goths and main∣tained part of their Spanish domain till the end of the Fifteenth century The present Spaniards are descended of the Vesigoths Romans and Iberians The Suevi  were united to the Gothic empire by Leovigild about  Odoacer at the head of the Turcilingi Scyrri Heruli and other mixt Sarmatic and Gothic tribes terminates the Roman empire in the west and reigns at Rome fourteen years  Theodoric the great king of the Ostrogoths in Pannonia vanquishes Odoacer and rules Italy which was now overwhelmed with Ostrogoths of whom Lombards and the old inhabitants the present Italians spring  The Franks under Clovis subdue the Vesigoths in Gaul and the Burgundians an event with which properly commences the French kingdom  The Lombards also deserve mention Paulus Dia∣conus follows Jornandes the idol of the middle ages and brings them from Scandinavia But we prefer Tacitus who finds them in the heart of Germany Thence they moved southwest till they settled in Pan∣nonia about years after Christ or as i rather suspect after Attila's death or about when the Gepidae  The Gepidae are singular in history and special dissertations on them and other Basternic nations would be interesting The Geloni are as often mentioned by Claudian along with the Getae as are the Gepidae by Jornandes and Procopius and the geographic situation allotted to them by those writers leaves no room to doubt that they were the same people and a part of the Basternae  of whom ancient authors call the Longo∣bardi a part Grotii Proleg seized Dacia In Pan∣nonia the Lombards remained till about when under Alboin they seized on the north of Italy and after held almost the whole save Rome and Ravenna till when Desiderius the last king was vanquished by Charlemagne  Appendix  Pliny's Description of the Northern parts of Europe with a translation and

and the iles in Pontus Euxinus pro∣ceeding east from Spain he passes north to the Scythic Ocean and returns west toward Spain  We must now depart thence to speak of the extreme parts of Europe and passing the Riphaean mountains  pursue the shore of the Northern Ocean to the left till we come to Gades Many ilands without names are said to be in that tract Of which one opposite to Scy∣thia called Raunonia is distant a day's course on which in spring amber is cast up by the waves as Timaeus tells The other shores are marked by uncer∣tain fame The Northern ocean Hecataeus calls Amal∣chium from the river Paropamisus where it washes Scythia which name in the language of that people implies Congealed or Frozen Philemon says it is called Morimarusa by the Cimbri signifying the Dead Sea till it reaches the promontory Rubeas and beyond that it is called Cronium Xenophon of Lampsacus re∣lates that three days sail from the coast of the Scythians there is an iland of immense size called Baltia Pytheas terms the same iland Basilia The Oonae are also spoken of in which the natives live on eggs of birds and on oats Others in which are men born with horses feet and thence named Hippopodes Others of the Fanesii whose otherwise naked bodies are covered with their vast ears  Thence clearer accounts begin with the nation of Ingaevones the first on that side of Germany There Sevo an immense range of mountains nor less than the Riphaean forms a great bay even to the Cimbric Promontory which bay is termed Codanus and is full of ilands Of which the most famous is Scandinavia of undiscovered greatness the Hilleviones in five hun∣dred districts inhabiting the only part known who call it another world Nor is Eningia less in opinion Some relate that those tracts even to the river Vistula are inhabited by the Sarmatae Venedi Sciri and Hirri and that the bay is called Cylipenum and an ile in it's mouth Latris Then another bay called Lagnus adjacent to the Cimbri The Cimbric Promontory running far into the sea forms a peninsula called Cartris Thence are Twentythree iles known to the Roman arms The noblest of them are Burchana called Fabaria by our people from a spontaneous fruit in the shape of a bean Also Glessaria so called by our soldiers from it's amber but by the barbarians Austra∣nia and likewise Actania  Along this whole sea even to the river Scaldis the German nations dwell in a space not explicable the discordance of accounts being so immoderate The  Greeks and some of us have related the borders of Germany to be of Twentyfive Hundred miles Agrippa including Rhaetia and Noricum puts it's length at miles it's breadth at the breadth of Rhaetia almost alone subdued about the time of Agrippa's death being greater than that of Germany  on the South  For Germany was not known many years after nor is yet thoroughly so If conjecture may be allowed there will not be much wanting of its circum∣ference in the opinion of the Greeks and of it's length as given by Agrippa  There are Five divisions of Germans The Vandili of whom a part are the Burgundiones Varini Cari∣ni Guttones Another Division is the Ingaevones of whom are the Cimbri Teutoni and nations of Chauci Nearest the Rhine are the Istaevones of whom the in∣land Cimbri form a part The Hermiones of whom are the Suevi Hermunduri Chatti Cherusci The Fisth Part is formed by the Peukini

Nations on the Scythic Ocean  Now having described the inner parts of Asia my mind passes the Riphaean mountains and traces the shore of the Ocean on the right hand Which washing Asia on three points of heaven is called Scythic on the north Eoan on the east Indian on the south and is variously divided into many lesser names from it's bays and the inhabitants of it's shores But a great portion of Asia exposed to the north by the injury of a rigid star has vast solitudes From the extreme north toward the northeast are Scythae Without them and beyond the beginnings of the north some place the Hyperborei whom more ascribe to Europe Thence first is known the pronontory of Celtica Lytarmis and the river Carambucis where burdened with the force of the stars the chain of Riphaean mountains fails There we have reports of Arimphaei a nation not dissimilar to the Hyperborei Beyond them  on the right or east  are the Scythae Cimmerii Cissian∣thi Georgi and Amazons These reach to the Cas∣pian and Hyrcanian sea For it bursts out of the Scythic ocean into the back parts of Asia It bursts in by narrow mouths but of great length    He then describes the Caspian Media Hyrcania and nations on Eoan Ocean Seres  c  REMARKS  Pliny's geography of the north is here given as the most full and curious of all antiquity It is surprising that Pliny's whole geography has not been printed separate as far superior to that of Mela and others Indeed an edition of Pliny by a society of literati is much wanted for Harduin the latest editor was of all men the most unfit for the task being rash and wrongheaded to a monstrous degree  The bounds of ancient knowlege on the West and South are fixt and clear On the East D' Anville has  fully settled it as in the map attending this work But the Northern the most important of all to the history of Europe D' Anville leaves as Cluverius ignorantly puts it and has thus left a prodigious task to succeeding geographers  The Riphaean mountains of Pliny as of Ptolemy palpably run from East to West  So Justin "Scythia in orientem porrecta clauditur ab uno latere Ponto et ab altero Montibus Riphaeis a tergo Asia et Ta∣nai flumine"  lib  II Thus the Riphaean Mountains ran parallel to the Euxine  as he passes them to go to the Scythic Ocean It is clear from Ptolemy that they ran along the head of Tanais and are often named with Tanais by the ancients for by all ancient accounts the Tanais rose in them No such mountains exist in Poland or Russia But this is nothing to the matter The question is what the ancients thought And it is clear that they often confounded a Forest with a chain of Mountains as Pliny here does the Hercynian Forest No wonder then that in civilized times no such Moun∣tains otherwise Forests are to be found The Riphae∣an Forest i am convinced was that now called Vol∣konski still miles long from the west to Moscow on the east It is also a range of small hills See Coxe's Travels  Timaeus as we learn from other passages of Pliny called this ile opposite Raunonia by the name Baltia It is therefore a slip of Pliny when he puts this among the nameless iles  What river the ancients called Paropamisus is doubt∣ful There was a mountain and region Paropamisus at the head of the Indus The Amalchian was evidently the eastern part of the Scythic Ocean Present  Sarasu  or some other river running north on the east of the Caspian may be Paropamisus  The Cimbri all know were on the west of the Baltic a part of the supposed Scythic Ocean of the an∣cients The promontory Rubeas seems to me that on the west of the mouth of the river Rubo or Dwina being the northern point of present Courland Cluve∣rius who puts it in the north of Lapland shews strange ignorance The ancients knew no more of Lapland than of America and were never further north than Shetland the real ancient Thule as D' Anville shews and the south parts of Scandinavia The Cronian  seems here the northeast part of the Baltic but other ancients supposed the Cronian to extend over all the north parts of their Scandinavia  The  Oceanus Deucaledonius  is by Ptolemy accounted an ex∣te  sion of the Baltic or  Sarmaticus  vii and he says expressly i that it was on the  North    of Britain    As Pliny tells us repeatedly in other places that Baltia or Basilia was the ile where only amber was found it is clearly Glessaria of Prussia not Scandinavia The iles Oonae c all grant to be those of Oesel c at the mouth of the Finnish gulf The fables arose from some strange peculiarity of dress  Pliny then comes west to Germany and tells us that the Ingaevones are the first German people on that side A strong proof of his own assertion that Germany was then little known For Tacitus found the Basternae on that side as did Ptolemy The Ingaevones accord∣ing to Pliny's own account were the Chauci c who were all on the west not the east so that he errs  toto caelo  Indeed Pliny may be excused if as Tacitus says the Ingaevones were all those on the ocean so as to include the Northern or Scythic Ocean  Cluverius is so utterly foolish as to put the  Sevo Mons  of Pliny in Norway in which childish blunder he is blindly followed as usual by Cellarius and by D' Anville which last has not examined one tittle of the ancient geography of Germany tho the most important of all to the history of Europe Pliny's Sevo Mons is actually that chain between Prussia and Silesia called  Asciburgius Mons  by Ptolemy and now  Zottenberg  This is clear from Pliny's words He mentions the Scythic Ocean then comes west to the Baltic and ile Baltia or Glessaria a peninsula of present Prussia then speaks of the  Hipp  podum insulae  by all granted to be Oesel and Dego at the mouth of the Dwina 'Thence a clearer account begins to be opened from the nation of Ingae∣vones the first of Germany on that side There the immense mountains of Sevo not less than the Riphaean form a vast bay even to the promontory of the Cimbri which bay is called Codanus and is full of iles Of which iles Scandinavia is of unknown size' c No∣thing can be more clear than this and the stupidity of Cluverius is amazing Had the Sevo Mons been in Norway as he lays it down it would have formed a  strait  with the  Promontorium Cimbrorum  or north point of Jutland and not a  bay  as Pliny states And how a range of mountains in Scandinavia could form that bay in which Scandinavia stood is left to those versant in solecisms to decide We must ever estimate ancient geography by ancient opinions Pliny  thought  that the Sevo Mons reached up from the mountains north of present Bohemia to that great promontory north of Dantzick called  Resehout  and  Heel  if i mistake not and formed the  Sinus Codanus  extending thence to the north point of Jutland and which is at present a great bay being the whole south part of the Baltic which from Dantzick runs north and not west as before In the map of modern Germany by Cluverius this chain of mountains is fully marked from the east of Bohemia and Silesia up to the Resehout Tacitus mentions this Sevo Mons tho he gives not the name as dividing the Suevi from north to south Solinus gives the Sevo Mons as Pliny and puts it among the Ingaevones to whom he also assigns the Vistula so that the case is clear Tacitus who was far better informed than Pliny shews that Pliny's statement of the Ingaevones is right here tho erroneous afterward for that name included all the nations on the Baltic and the Van∣dili of Pliny were Ingaevones Most ancients regarded the Vistula as the eastern bound of Germany and the Basternae as a German nation out of Germany so that the Sevo Mons as running along the Vis∣stula was on the eastern extremity of Germany as Pliny states  The Scandinavia of Pliny is the larger Scandia of Ptolemy not reaching beyond the Wener Lake as be∣fore explained The Hilleviones were in Haland Hyl  or  Hal  Mons  Isl The 'other world' here applied to Scandinavia is also by Pliny used in speaking of Ta∣probana or Ceylon so that it's weight can be estimated Eningia may be the south part of Finland perhaps by the ancients believed another ile in the Scythic Ocean The Venedi were Sarmatae beyond the Vistula beyond them Tacitus found the Fins and the Scirri and Hirri seem Finnish nations noted in later Roman history for the southern Fins were not unwarlike Lithuania is held by them and they seized on part of Hungary The Scirri and Hirri were on the Finnish gulf and known in the Ninth century as appears from the Peri∣plus  of Ohter and Wulfstan The Hirri gave name to  Irland  or  Virland  in Icelandic accounts now Reval  Sciringsheal  or the  rock  or  town  of the  Scirri  seems to have been present Kronstadt opposite Peterburg  Mr Forster in Barrington's Orosius followed also by Mr B in his Miscellanies errs so grossly as to take Ohter's Irland for Scotland Irland was on Ohter's right hand not on leaving Nor∣way but as he approached Sciringsheal There are no iles on the south of Scotland the iles between Irland and 'this land' are those of Oesel c The sea south of Sciringsheal is the Finnish gulf to which Gotland is opposite as Ohter says But compare the passage and see  Virland  in the maps to Snorro  Havnioe  c    The gulf Cylipenus is apparently that of Finland Lagnus another name for the south of the Baltic or Codanus Pliny having various authors before him was confounded with various names for the same subject Cartris is  Wendsyssel  on the north of Jutland a penin∣sula so called from  Wend  our  Kent  or  Cant  a point or headland Burchana is Funen or Zeeland iles of the Suiones  Pliny's Divisions of Germans are not unexception∣able The Vandili were by his own account Ingaevones as above shewn Of them the Varini were quite on the West next the Angli as perfectly known from Tacitus and the  Leges Warinorum et Anglorum  still extant and published by Leibnitz The other three were all together quite on the east So that Pliny's accuracy is not great The Cimbri Teutoni Chauci were all on the western ocean yet Pliny had placed the Ingaevones on the east The Istaevones were really next the Rhine but Tacitus found no Cimbri Mediterranei there The other two divisions are right But Tacitus is the author to be depended on as to Germany Pliny's description is however valuable  The Second Extract from lib VI c rather con∣cerns the north of Europe than of Asia The Tanais or Don was the ancient as the modern boundary of Asia and Europe But on the north moderns have ex∣tended it to the Uralian Mountains along the river Oby while the ancients brought it much farther west following the Tanais which runs southeast The east end of the Gulf of Finland was of course the ancient boundary between Asia and Europe Here then Pliny begins and goes to the east along the shores of a non∣existent ocean the Scythic till he comes to the river Volga which with many of the ancients he thought  was an inlet between the Scythic Ocean and Caspian sea Thus all the nations and places here mentioned are to be sought for in the southwest of present Russia The Scythae are about Smolenzko the Hyperborei he re∣tracts as by other ancients they are placed in present Prussia Lytarmis which like his Tabis beyond the Seres in Asia is a nonexistent promontory  The Greek  however and Latin  promontorium  also sig∣nify merely the summit or the termination of a chain of mountains  of mere fable he puts about present Moscow as were the Arim∣phaei Carambucis seems the river Sura The other nations lay on the Volga down to the Caspian The Georgi and Amazons as well known were between the Tanais and Volga above the Alani The opinion of a Scythic ocean seems to have prevailed in the Eleventh century for Adam of Bremen says people could sail from the Baltic down to Greece It seems also the  Ocean of Darkness  in Eastern writings I know not if it's existence was not believed in Europe till the Six∣teenth century  Index  A  Aestii not in
