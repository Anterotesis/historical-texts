your care  Guardians of honour and of injur'd worth  Spread the glad tidings round the list'ning Earth  Truth shines triumphant o'er insidious Craft  Defeated Slander drops her feeble shaft  While Justice gazing on the sphere of Fame  Points with fond pride to KEPPEL'S cloudless name  Emerging like the Sun with double light  From the dark transit of the orb of night  What shouts reechoed from our naval host  Fill the wide air and shake the crouded coast  The spreading transport circles round our shore  As if the foes of Britain were no more  Wak'd by these shouts from scenes of hallow'd rest  And to the Muse's eye alone confest  Departed Naval Chiefs an airy band  To share this triumph hover o'er the strand  Forth from that oozy bed and coral cave  Where the great Seaman found his watery grave  Comes Drake  Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins were institutors of that noble fund the Chest at ChathamFor the personal history of these great men and most of those mentioned with them see  Campbell's Lives of the Admirals  whose flag by Glory's hand unfurl'd  Trac'd the first circle round th' astonish'd world  With Hawkins names by Charity confest  The generous founders of her naval chest  The great chastisers of invading Spain  Howard the leader of that patriot train  Monson whose pen his own bright labours crown'd  And Blake for Roman discipline renown'd  Monk at whose tomb both Earth and Ocean weep  Great in the field and greater on the deep  Then the first S **** who selfdoom'd to die  Fix'd to his burning ship disdain'd to fly  Frowning just wrath he comes and scorns to own  An heir succeeding to his name alone  Undaunted Ayscue Sprag by Dryden sung  Russel whose arm the bolts of Freedom flung  On that proud Gallic fleet which dar'd to bring  A tyrant's aid to an apostate king  Herbert to whom the wornout seaman owes  A public refuge and wellearn'd repose  Benbo whom wounds but animate to fame  Whose great soul triumph'd o'er his shatter'd frame  Cloudesly illstarr'd with him  Sir George Rooke  whose deeds remain  'Grav'd on the conquer'd rock of humbled Spain  And the great Seaman of our later days  Anson who born a sunk marine to raise  Reform'd our fleets and sent them to proclaim  Around the globe familiar with his name  His guiding genius and his country's fame  These Chiefsand with them an extended line  Of names that bright in naval annals shine  These to thy triumph with delight repair  And thus salute thee as they float in air  "Hail gallant Seaman on whose solid fame  "Envy's wild rage reduc'd to silent shame  "Falls like the threat'ning wave whose furious shock  "Ends but in foam against th' unshaken rock  "Hail to thee KEPPEL Hail from perils sav'd  "Worse than thy courage on the deep has brav'd  "Trying the hour when by the whirlwind's breath  "The billow teems with darkest forms of death  "Trying when England's dauntless sons oppose  "The shatter'd ship against her trebled foes  "But far more trying is Detraction's dart  "And the dark stab of ministerial art  "By these our glory and Iberia's dread  "Brave injur'd name th' accomplish'd Raleigh bled  "A still superior name and Ocean's pride  "By these oppress'd the great Columbus died  "But in thy cause solicitous to heal  "The wounds of honour with parental zeal  "Justice and Freedom glory to defend  "From these detested foes their injur'd friend  "Our souls responsive join their joyous cry  "Give thy untarnish'd flag again to fly  "Confest the Guardian of a grateful land  "Late be Thou number'd with our sainted band  "Rich in thy gather'd fame and grac'd with long command"  To thee O KEPPEL while the Muse conveys  These hallow'd accents of no mortal praise  May she with glory all thy wrongs repay  May her bright subject consecrate her lay  'Tis hers all furious party rage above  The faithful herald of a nation's love  With naval oak to twine her laurel leaf  And crown the temples of her fav'rite Chief  'Tis hers while warm her indignation glows  Hurling contempt on thy defeated foes  With an impartial and avenging hand  The blushing front of Calumny to brand  Worst of all evils of all pests the chief  Diffusing general or domestic grief  Pernicious child of a corrupted state  With private horror mark'd and public hate  False Accusation stands whose serpent tooth  Delights to fasten on distinguish'd Truth  In Greece in Rome when guardian freedom fled  On noblest blood this fatten'd monster fed  There every bribe that could allure the slave  All that distinction once to virtue gave  Debas'd by tyrants to the villain's pay  Tempted this lurking fiend to brave the open day  O P******* the Muse disdains to think  A naval son of England e'er could sink  To sell his fame and as an hireling rend  The unsuspecting bosom of a friend  No 'twas wild passion pride and spleen combin'd  To rob of reason thy disorder'd mind  Which while delirious dreams its powers enthrall  Mistook a statesman's smile for honour's call  At length awaking Freedom like the Sun  Shews thee the fatal course thy frenzy run  And that of all by public hatred curst  The baffled False Accuser ranks the first  In  Sir Lewis Stuckley Vice Admiral of Devonshire and the kinsman of Raleigh whose design of escaping he perfidiously betrayed was surprized in Whitehall clipping the gold bestowed on him as a reward of his treachery and being condemned for that crime and reduced to the necessity of stripping himself to his shirt to raise money to purchase a pardon withdrew himself from the odium of mankind to the island of Lundy in the Severn Sea where he died mad in less than two years after Raleigh  Birch's Life of Sir W Raleigh  Stuckley's end their dreadful fate we view  Whose plots the ruin of the brave pursue  Stuckley that knight of perfidy who sold  The blood of Raleigh for a tyrant's gold  Full on himself his own dire arts recoil'd  First of the wages of his sin despoil'd  Then justly doom'd his head abhorr'd to hide  In frantic penury the traitor died  Worst of bad menYet see a name appear  Which deeper brands of detestation sear  Whose soul would rob by basest passion led  The brave of honour and the poor of bread  Who plac'd the stream of Charity to guide  And o'er her hallow'd temple to preside  In darkness entering at a private door  Profanes with vile abuse her sacred store  O if our Isle who boasts a generous race  Could rear a being of a soul so base  May public vengeance all his guilt proclaim  And injur'd honour execrate his name  While in full day his deepest crimes are seen  Give him to feel how wide the space between  Th eselfperplexing wiles of courtly art  And the clear conduct of a KEPPEL'S heart  That generous heart with public virtue fraught  Of private vengeance will despise the thought  For thy Accuser KEPPEL still retain  Silent abhorrence and a brave disdain  Whate'er his motives if of envy born  Disease of little minds they merit scorn  If sprung from public zeal with passion blind  They claim the pity of thy nobler mind  Thy mind which scorn'd to play the accuser's part  Or doubt the courage of an English heart  E'en in those galling hours when rear'd in vain  Thy warlike signal call'd a tardy train  And disobedience join'd with envious night  To rob thy valour of the promis'd fight  Full oft have Chiefs disgusted with command  Abjur'd the service of a thankless land  Untaught "to bear the wrongs of base mankind  The last and hardest conquest of the mind"  May'st thou O KEPPEL every wrong forget  And pay thy Country still a Briton's debt  Clear as thy own may England's honour grow  Prov'd by the voice of each applauding foe  Tho' speculation in dark visions tost  Has long pronounc'd her mighty Empire lost  There are who o'er the fancied ruin sigh  Who course of thought and course of language cry  "That England fell in that disastrous hour  When the Scotch serpent climb'd the tree of power"  Who hid in government's perplex'd machine  Yet lives malignant and corrodes unseen  Thus while th' imperial ship sublimely rides  In awful splendor on the subject tides  Beneath her keel a foe insidious lurks  Thro' the strong oak the mining mischief works  The lofty fabric tho' in semblance firm  Sinks the proud victim of a foreign worm  Whate'er this voice by sceptics may be found  Faction's false cry or Truth's prophetic sound  Let ev'ry Briton with bold Blake proclaim  His ruling passion is his Country's fame  What men so'er her seats of counsel fill  The brave must feel she is their country still  Let them for her the worst of perils dare  And never never of the state despair  Not e'en when doom'd with darkness to o'erspread  The sacred glory round Britannia's head  The evil genius of the pale ****  Prompts the weak pause or plans the dire campaign  The curse of Minden's field or Saratoga's plain  Yet dare to hope that built by Freedom's hand  The splendid pile of Britain's fame shall stand  Tho' her weak statesmen ill sustain its weight  Mere mould'ring vain pilasters of the state  Yet British Virtue theme of noblest song  Strong in her fleets and in her armies strong  Like the firm cement of an ancient tower  Desies the rage of time and ev'ry hostile pow'r  This Virtue still the Bard's peculiar care  Shall prompt the patriot song and martial pray'r  "Thou God of hosts whose sacred breath imparts  Valour's unclouded flame to British hearts  Whose hand has spread our triumphs round the globe  And drest the Queen of Isles in glory's gorgeous robe  May thy protecting spirit still the same  Sustain her tott'ring on the throne of Fame  But if prepar'd th' avenging Angel stand  To pour thy wrath on this devoted land  If her brave sons their forfeit lives must pay  Grant them to perish in the face of day  For Britain perish 'mid the combat's clang  Where Honour's smile endears the dying pang  Let Courage when ensnar'd by Falshood's breath  Still burst the toils of ignominious death  And Justice prove that Truth will ne'er depart  From her firm seat the genuine Sailor's heart  O ye our Island's Pride and Nature's boast  Whose peerless valour guards and gilds our coast  Ye gallant Seamen in this trying hour  Remember union is the soul of power  Nor let dissention with infectious hand  Shake the firm strength of your fraternal band  Your injur'd country bids you join to throw  Avenging thunders on your common foe  Let anger scorn the rancorous debate  The low and little jars of private hate  And nobly sacrifice each selfish aim  On the bright Altar of Britannia's Fame"
