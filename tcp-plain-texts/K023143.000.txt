 A KEY TO THE LOCK  OR A TREATISE proving beyond all Contradiction the dangerous Tendency of a late Poem entituled  The RAPE of the LOCK  TO GOVERNMENT and RELIGION  By ESDRAS BARNIVELT Apoth  LONDON  Printed for J ROBERTS near the  Oxford Arms  in  Warwicklane    THE Epistle Dedicatory TO Mr  POPE  THough it may seem foreign to my Profession which is that of making up and dispensing salutary Medicines to his Majesty's Subjects I might say my FellowSubjects since I have had the Advantage of being naturalized yet cannot I think it unbecoming me to furnish an Antidote against the Poyson which hath been so artfully distilled through your Quill and convey'd to the World through the pleasing Vehicle of your Numbers Nor is my Profession as an Apothecary so abhorrent from yours as a Poet since the Antients have thought fit to make the same  God the Patron of Both I have not without some Pleasure observ'd the mystical Arms of our Company wherein is represented  Apollo  killing the fell Monster  Python  this in some measure admonishes me of my Duty to trample upon and destroy as much as in me lies that Dragon or baneful Serpent  Popery  I must take leave to make you my Patient whether you will or no though out of the Respect I have for you I should rather chuse to apply Lenitive than Corrosive Medicines happy if they may prove an Emetic sufficient to make you cast up those Errors which you have imbibed in your Education and which I hope I shall never live to see this Nation digest  Sir I cannot but lament that a Gentleman of your acute Wit rectified Understanding and sublimated Imagination should misapply those Talents to raise ill Humours in the Constitution of the Body Politick of which your self are a Member and upon the Health whereof your own Preservation depends Give me leave to say such  Principles as yours would again reduce us to the fatal Necessity of the Phlebotomy of War or the Causticks of Persecution  In order to inform you of this I have sought your Acquaintance and Conversation with the utmost diligence for I hoped in Person to persuade you to a publick Confession of your Fault and a Recantation of these dangerous Tenets But finding all my Endeavours ineffectual and being satisfied with the Conscience of having done all that became a Man of an honest Heart and honourable Intention I could no longer omit my Duty in opening the Eyes of the World by the Publication of this Discourse It was indeed written some Months since but seems not the less proper at this Juncture when I find so universal an Encouragement given by both Parties to the Author of a libellous Work that is designed equally to prejudice them both The uncommon Sale of this Book for above of'em have been already vended was also a farther Reason that call'd aloud upon me to put a stop to its further Progress and to preserve  his Majesty's Subjects by exposing the whole Artifice of your Poem in publick  Sir to address my self to so florid a Writer as you without collecting all the Flowers of Rhetorick would be an unpardonable  Indecorum  but when I speak to the World as I do in the following Treatise I must use a simple Stile since it would be absurd to prescribe an universal Medicine or  Catholicon  in a Language not universally understood  As I have always professed to have a particular Esteem for Men of Learning and more especially for your self nothing but the Love of Truth should have engaged me in a Design of this Nature  Amicus Plato Amicus Socrates sed magis Amica Veritas  I am  Your most Sincere Friend and Humble Servant  E Barnivelt  A KEY to the  LOCK  SINCE this unhappy Division of our Nation into Parties it is not to be imagined how many Artifices have been made use of by Writers to obscure the Truth and cover Designs which may be detrimental to the Publick in particular it has been their Custom of late to vent their Political Spleen in Allegory and Fable If an honest believing Nation is to be made a Jest of we have a Story of  John Bull  and his Wife if a Treasurer is to be glanced at an  Ant  with a  white Straw  is introduced if a Treaty of Commerce is to be ridiculed 'tis immediately metamorphosed into a Tale of Count  Tariff  But if any of these Malevolents have never so small a Talent in Rhime they principally delight to convey their Malice in that pleasing way as it were gilding the Pill and concealing the Poyson under the Sweetness of Numbers Who could imagine that an  Original  Canto  of  Spencer  should contain a Satyr upon one Administration or that  Yarhel  's  Kitchin  or the  Dogs of Egypt  should be a Sarcasm upon another  It is the Duty of every well designing Subject to prevent as far as in him lies the ill Consequences of such pernicious Treatises and I hold it mine to warn the Publick of the late Poem entituled the  RAPE of the LOCK  which I shall demonstrate to be of this nature Many of these sort of Books have been bought by honest and wellmeaning People purely for their Diversion who have in the end found themselves insensibly led into the Violence of Party Spirit and many domestick Quarrels have been occasioned by the different Application of these Books The Wife of an eminent Citizen grew very noisy upon reading  Bob Hush John Bull  upon  Change  was thought not only to concern the State but to affront the City and the Poem we are now treating of has not only dissolved an agreeable Assembly of Beaus and Belles but as I am told has set Relations at as great a distance as if they were married together  It is a common and just Observation that when the Meaning of any thing is dubious one can no way better judge of the true Intent of it than by considering who is the Author what is his Character in general and his Disposition in particular  Now that the Author of this Poem is professedly a  Papist  is well known and that a Genius so capable of doing Service to that Cause may have been corrupted in the Course of his Education by  Jesuits  or others is justly very much to be suspected notwithstanding that seeming  Coolness  and  Moderation  which he has been perhaps artfully reproached with by those of his own Profession They are sensible that this Nation is secured with good and wholesome Laws to prevent all evil Practices of the Church of  Rome  particularly the Publication of Books that may in any sort propagate that Doctrine Their Authors are therefore obliged to couch their Designs the deeper and tho' I cannot averr that the Intention of this Gentleman was directly to spread Popish Doctrines yet it comes to the same Point if he touch the Government For the Court of  Rome  knows very well that the Church at this time is so firmly founded on the State that the only way to shake the one is by attacking the other  What confirms me in this Opinion is an accidental Discovery I made of a very artful Piece of Management among his Popish Friends and Abettors to hide this whole Design upon the Government by taking all the Characters upon themselves  Upon the Day that this Poem was published it was my Fortune to step into the  Cocoa Tree  where a certain Gentleman was railing very  liberally at the Author with a Passion extremely well counterfeited for having as he said reflected upon him in the Character of  Sir Plume  Upon his going out I enquired who he was and they told me  a Roman Catholick Knight  I was the same Evening at  Will  's and saw a Circle round another Gentleman who was railing in like manner and showing his Snuffbox and Cane to prove he was satyrized in the same Character I asked this Gentleman's Name and was told he was  a Roman Catholick Lord  A Day or two after I was sent for upon a slight Indisposition to the young Lady's to whom the Poem is dedicated She also took up the Character of  Belinda  with much Frankness and good Humour tho' the Author has given us a Key in his  The Character of  Belinda  as it is here manag'd resemble you in nothing but in Beauty  Dedication to the  Rape of the Lock  Dedication that he meant something further This Lady is also a  Roman Catholick  At the same time others of the Characters were claim'd by some Persons in the Room and all of them  Roman Catholicks  But to proceed to the Work it self  In all things which are intricate as Allegories in their own Nature are and especially  those that are industriously made so it is not to be expected we should find the Clue at first sight but when once we have laid hold on that we shall trace this our Author through all the Labyrinths Doublings and Turnings of this intricate Composition  First then let it be observed that in the most demonstrative Sciences some  Postulata  are to be granted upon which the rest is naturally founded I shall desire no more than one  Postulatum  to render this obvious to the meanest Capacity which being granted me I shall not only shew the Intent of this Work in general but also explain the very  Names  and expose all his fictitious  Characters  in their true Light and we shall find that even his  Spirits  were not meerly contrived for the sake of  Machinary  The only Concession which I desire to be made me is that by the  Lock  is meant  The BARRIER TREATY  I First then I shall discover that BELINDA represents GREAT BRITAIN or which is the same thing her late MAJESTY This is plainly seen in his Description of her  On her white Breast a sparkling Cross she bore  Alluding to the antient Name of  Albion  from her  white Cliffs  and to the  Cross  which is the Ensign of  England  II The BARON who cuts off the Lock or Barrier Treaty is the E of  O  d  III CLARISSA who lent the Scissars my Lady  M  m  IV THALESTRIS who provokes  Belinda  to resent the Loss of the Lock or Treaty the D  s of  M  gh  V SIR PLUME who is mov'd by  Thalestris  to redemand it of  Great Britain  P  ce  Eu  ne  who came hither for that purpose  There are other inferior Characters which we shall observe upon afterwards but I shall first explain the foregoing  The first Part of the  Baron  's Character is his being  adventrous  or enterprizing which is the common Epithet given the E  of  O  d  by his Enemies The Prize he aspires to is the T  y in order to which he offers a Sacrifice  an Altar built  Of twelve vast  French  Romances neatly gilt  Our Author here takes occasion maliciously to insinuate this Statesman's  Love to France  representing the Books he chiefly studies to be  vast  French Romances  These are the vast Prospects from the Friendship and Alliance of  France  which he satyrically calls  Romances  hinting thereby that these Promises and Protestations were no more to be relied on than those idle Legends Of these he is said to build an Altar to intimate that all the Foundation of his Schemes and Honours was fix'd upon the  French Romances  abovementioned  A Fan a Garter Half a Pair of Gloves  One of the things he sacrifices is a  Fan  which both for its  gaudy Show  and  perpetual Flutt'ring  has been made the Emblem of  Woman  This points at the Change of the  Ladies  of the  Bedchamber  the  Garter  alludes to the Honours he conferr'd on some of his Friends and we may without straining the Sense call the Half Pair of Gloves a  Gauntlet  the Token of those Military Employments which he is said to have sacrificed to his Designs The Prize as I said before means the T  y which he makes it his Prayers  soon to obtain  and  long to possess  The Pow'rs gave ear and granted half his Pray'r  The rest the Winds dispers'd in empty Air  In the first of these Lines he gives him the T  y and in the last suggests that he should not long possess that Honour  That  Thalestris  is the D  s of  M  gh  appears both by her Nearness to  Belinda  and by this Author's malevolent Suggestion that she is a Lover of War  To Arms to Arms the bold  Thalestris  cries  But more particularly in several Passages in her Speech to  Belinda  upon the cutting off the Lock or Treaty Among other things she says  Was it for this you bound your Locks in Paper Durance  Was it for this so much Paper has been spent to secure the Barrier Treaty  Methinks already I your Tears survey  Already hear the horrid things they say  Already see you a degraded Toast  This describes the Aspersions under which that good Princess suffer'd and the Repentance which must have followed the Dissolution of that Treaty and particularly levels at the Refusal some People made to drink her M  y's Health  Sir Plume  a proper Name for a Soldier has all the Circumstances that agree with P  ce  Eu  ne  Sir Plume  of Amber Snuffbox justly vain  And the nice Conduct of a clouded Cane  With earnest Eyes  'Tis remarkable this General is a great Taker of Snuff as well as Towns his Conduct of the clouded Cane gives him the Honour which is so justly his due of an exact Conduct in Battle which is figured by his Truncheon the Ensign of a General His earnest Eye or the Vivacity of his Look is so particularly remarkable in him that this Character could be mistaken for no other had not this Author purposely obscur'd it by the fictitious Circumstance of a  round unthinking Face  Having now explained the chief Characters of his  Human Persons  for there are some others that will hereafter fall in by the by in the Sequel of this Discourse I shall next take in pieces his  Machinary  wherein his Satyr is wholly confined to Ministers of State  The SYLPHS and GNOMES at first sight appeared to me to signify the two contending Parties of this Nation for these being placed in the  Air  and those on the  Earth  I thought agreed very well with the common Denomination HIGH and LOW But as they are made to be the first Movers and Influencers of  all that happens 'tis plain they represent promiseuously the  Heads of Parties  whom he makes to be the Authors of all those Changes in the State which are generally imputed to the Levity and Instability of the  British  Nation  This erring Mortals Levity may call  Oh blind to Truth the Sylphs contrive it all  But of this he has given us a plain Demonstration for speaking of these Spirits he says in express Terms  The chief the Care of Nations own  And guard with Arms Divine the  British  Throne  And here let it not seem odd if in this mysterious way of Writing we find the same Person who has before been represented by the  Baron  again described in the Character of  Ariel  it being a common way with Authors in this fabulous Manner to take such a Liberty As for instance I have read in the  English St Evremont  that all the different Characters in  Petronius  are but  Nero  in so many different Appearances And in the Key to the curious Romance of  Barclay  's  Argenis  that both  Poliarchus  and  Archombrotus  mean only the  King  of  Navarre  We observe in the very Beginning of the Poem that  Ariel  is possess'd of the Ear of  Belinda  therefore it is absolutely necessary that this Person must be the Minister who was nearest the Queen But whoever would be further convinced that he meant the late T  r may know him by his Ensigns in the following Line  He rais'd his Azure Wand  His sitting on the Mast of a Vessel shows his presiding over the  S  th S  a  Tr  de When  Ariel  assigns to his  Sylphs  all the Posts about  Belinda  what is more clearly described than the Tr  r's disposing all the Places of the Kingdom and particularly about her M  y But let us hear the Lines  Ye Spirits to your Charge repair  The flutt'ring Fan be  Zephyretta  's Care  The Drops to thee  Brillante  we consign  And  Momentilla  let the Watch be thine  Do thou  Crispissa  tend her fav'rite Lock  He has here particularized the Ladies and Women of the BedChamber the Keeper of the Cabinet and her M  y's Dresser and impudently given Nicknames to each  To put this Matter beyond all dispute the  Sylphs  are said to be  wond'rous fond of Place  in the Canto following where  Ariel  is perched uppermost and all the rest take their Places subordinately under him  Here again I cannot but observe the excessive Malignity of this Author who could not leave this Character of  Ariel  without the same invidious Stroke which he gave him in the Character of the  Baron  before  Amaz'd confus'd he saw his Pow'r expir'd  Resign'd to Fate and with a Sigh retir'd  Being another Prophecy that he should resign his Place which it is probable all Ministers do with a Sigh  At the Head of the  Gnomes  he sets  Ʋmbriel  a dusky melancholy Spright who makes it his Business to give  Belinda  the Spleen a vile and malicious Suggestion against some grave and worthy Minister The Vapours Fantoms Visions and the like are the Jealousies Fears and Cries of Danger that have so often affrighted and alarm'd the Nation Those who are described in the House of Spleen under those several fantastical Forms are the same whom their Illwillers have so often called the  Whimsical  The two foregoing Spirits being the only considerable Characters of the Machinary I  shall but just mention the  Sylph  that is wounded with the Scissars at the Loss of the Lock by whom is undoubtedly understood my L  d  To  d  who at that time received a Wound in his Character for making the Barrier Treaty and was cut out of his Employment upon the Dissolution of it But that Spirit reunites and receives no Harm to signify that it came to nothing and his Lrdshp had no real Hurt by it  But I must not conclude this Head of the Characters without observing that our Author has run through every Stage of Beings in search of Topicks for Detraction and as he has characterized some Persons under Angels and Men so he has others under Animals and things inanimate He has represented an eminent Clergyman as a Dog and a noted Writer as a Tool Let us examine the former  But  Shock  who thought she slept too long  Leapt up and wak'd his Mistress with his Tongue  Twas then  Belinda  if Report say true  Thy Eyes first open'd on a Billetdoux  By this  Shock  it is manifest he has most audatiously and profanely reflected on Dr  Sa  ch  ll  who leapt up that is into the Pulpit and awaken'd  Great Britain  with his  Tongue  that is  with his  Sermon  which made so much  Noise  and for which he has frequently been term'd by others of his Enemies as well as by this Author a Dog Or perhaps by his  Tongue  may be more literally meant his  Speech  at his  Trial  since immediately thereupon our Author says her Eyes open'd on a  Billetdoux Billetsdoux  being Addresles to Ladies from Lovers may be aptly interpreted those Addresses of Loving Subjects to her M  y which ensued that Trial  The other Instance is at the End of the third Canto  Steel did the Labours of the Gods destroy  And strike to Dust th'Imperial Tow'rs of  Troy  Steel could the Works of mortal Pride confound  And hew triumphal Arches to the Ground  Here he most impudently attributes the Demolition of  Dunkirk  not to the Pleasure of her M  y or her Ministry but to the frequent Instigations of his Friend Mr  Steel  a very artful Pun to conceal his wicked Lampoonery  Having now considered the general Intent and Scope of the Poem and open'd the Characters I shall next discover the Malice which is covered under the Episodes and particular Passages of it  The Game at  Ombre  is a mystical Representation of the late War which is hinted by his making Spades the Trump Spade in  Spanish  signifying a Sword and being yet so painted in the Cards of that Nation to which it is well known we owe the Original of our Cards In this one Place indeed he has unawares paid a Compliment to the Queen and her Success in the War for  Belinda  gets the better of the two that play against her the Kings of  France  and  Spain  I do not question but ev'ry particular Card has its Person and Character assigned which no doubt the Author has told his Friends in private but I shall only instance in the Description of the Disgrace under which the D  of  M  ough  then suffer'd which is so apparent in these Verses  Ev'n mighty  Pam  that Kings and Queens o'erthrew  And mow'd down Armies in the Fights of  Lu  Sad Chance of War now destitute of Aid  Falls undistinguish'd  That the Author here had an Eye to our modern Transactions is very plain from an unguarded Stroke towards the End of this Game  And now as oft in some  distemper'd State  On  one nice Trick  depends the gen'ral Fate  After the Conclusion of the War the publick Rejoicings and  Thanksgivings  are ridiculed in the two following Lines  The Nymph exalting fills with Shouts the Sky  The Walls the Woods and long Canals reply  Immediately upon which there follows a malicious Insinuation in the manner of a Prophecy which we have formerly observ'd this seditious Writer delights in that the Peace should continue but a short time and that the Day should afterwards be curst which was then celebrated with so much Joy  Sudden these Honours shall be snatch'd away  And curst for ever this Victorious Day  As the Game at  Ombre  is a satyrical Representation of the late War so is the TeaTable that ensues of the CouncilTable and its Consultations after the Peace By this he would hint that all the Advantages we have gain'd by our late extended Commerce are only Coffee  and Tea or things of no greater Value That he thought of the Trade in this Place appears by the Passage where he represents the  Sylphs  particularly careful of the  rich Brocade  it having been a frequent Complaint of our Mercers that  French Brocades  were imported in too great Quantities I will not say he means those Presents of rich Gold Stuff Suits which were said to be made her M  y by the K  of F  tho' I cannot but suspect that he glances at it  Here this Author as well as the scandalous  John Dunton  represents the Mi  ry in plain Terms taking frequent Cups  And frequent Cups prolong the rich Repast  Upon the whole it is manifest he meant something more than common Coffee by his calling it  Coffee that makes the  Politician  wise  And by telling us it was this Coffee that  Sent up in Vapours to the  Baron  's Brain  New  Stratagems    I shall only further observe that 'twas at this Table the Lock was cut off for where but at the Council Board should the Barrier Treaty be dissolved  The ensuing Contentions of the Parties upon the Loss of that Treaty are described in the Squabbles following the Rape of the Lock and this he rashly expresses without any disguise in the Words  All side in  Parties    Here first you have a Gentleman who sinks beside his Chair a plain Allusion to a Noble Lord who lost his Chair of Pre  nt of the Co  l  I come next to the  Bodkin  so dreadful in the Hand of  Belinda  by which he intimates the  British Scepter  so rever'd in the Hand of our late August Princess His own Note upon this Place tells us he alludes to a Scepter and the Verses are so plain they need no Remark  The same his antient Personage to deck  Her great great Grandsire wore about his Neck  In three Seal Rings which after melted down  Form'd a vast Buckle for his Widow's Gown  Her Infant Grandame's Whistle next it grew  The Bells she gingled and the Whistle blew  Then in a Bodkin grac'd her Mother's Hairs  Which long she wore and now  Belinda  wears  An open Satyr upon  Hereditary Right  The three Seal Rings plainly allude to the three Kingdoms  These are the chief Passages in the Battle by which as hath before been said he means the Squabble of Parties Upon this Occasion he could not end the Description of them without testifying his malignant Joy at those Dissentions from which he forms the Prospect that  both  should be disappointed and cries out with Triumph as if it were already accomplished  Behold how oft ambitious Arms are crost  And Chiefs contend till all the Prize is lost  The Lock at length is turn'd into a  Star  or the Old Barrier Treaty into a new and glorious  Peace  this no doubt is what the Author at the time he printed his Poem would have been thought to mean in hopes by that Complement to escape Punishment for the rest of his Piece It puts me in mind of a Fellow who concluded a bitter Lampoon upon the Prince and Court of his Days with these Lines  God save the King the Commons and the Peers  And grant the Author long may wear his Ears  Whatever this Author may think of that Peace I imagine it the most  extraordinary Star  that ever appear'd in our Hemisphere A Star that is to bring us all the Wealth and Gold of the  Indies  and from whose Influence not Mr  John Partridge  alone whose worthy Labours this Writer so ungenerously ridicules but all true  Britains  may with no less Authority than he prognosticate the Fall of  Lewis  in the Restraint of the exorbitant Power of  France  and the Fate of  Rome  in the triumphant Condition of the Church of  England  We have now considered this Poem in its Political View wherein we have shewn that it hath two different Walks of Satyr the one in the Story it self which is a Ridicule on the late Transactions in general the other in the Machinary which is a Satyr on the Ministers of State in particular I shall now show that the same Poem taken in another Light has a Tendency to Popery which is secretly insinuated through the whole  In the first place he has conveyed to us the Doctrine of Guardian Angels and Patron Saints in the Machinary of his  Sylphs  which being a  Piece of Popish Superstition that hath been endeavoured to be exploded ever since the Reformation he would here revive under this Disguise Here are all the Particulars which they believe of those Beings which I shall sum up in a few Heads    st  The Spirits are made to concern themselves with all human Acts in general    dly  A distinct Guardian Spirit or Patron is assigned to each Person in particular  Of these am I who thy Protection claim  A watchful Sprite    dly  They are made directly to inspire Dreams Visions and Revelations  Her Guardian  Sylph  prolong'd her balmy Rest  'Twas he had summon'd to her silent Bed  The Morning Dream    thly  They are made to be subordinate in different Degrees some presiding over others So  Ariel  hath his several UnderOfficers at Command  Superior by the Head was  Ariel  plac'd    thly  They are employed in various Offices and each hath his Office assigned him  Some in the Fields of purest Aether play  And bask and whiten in the Blaze of Duy  Some guide the Course  c    thly  He hath given his Spirits the Charge of the several Parts of Dress intimating thereby that the Saints preside over the several Parts of Human Bodies They have one Saint to cure the Toothach another cures the Gripes another the Gout and so of all the rest  The flutt'ring Fan be  Zephyretta  's Care  The Drops to thee  Brillante  we consign  c    thly  They are represented to know the Thoughts of Men  As on the Nosegay in her Breast reclin'd  He watch'd th' Ideas rising in her Mind    thly  They are made Protectors even to Animals and irrational Beings  Ariel  himself shall be the Guard of  Shock  So St  Anthony  presides over Hogs  c    thly  Others are made Patrons of whole Kingdoms and Provinces  Of these the chief the Care of Nations own  So St  George  is imagined by the Papists to defend  England  St  Patrick Ireland  St  James Spain  c Now what is the Consequence of all this By granting that they have this Power we must be brought back again to pray to them  The  Toilette  is an artful Recommendation of the  Mass  and pompous Ceremonies of the  Church of Rome  The  unveiling  of the  Altar  the  Silver Vases  upon it being  rob'd  in  White  as the Priests are upon the chief Festivals and the  Head uncover'd  are manifest Marks of this  A heav'nly Image in the Glass appears  To that she bends  Plainly denotes  ImageWorship  The  Goddess  who is deck'd with  Treasures Jewels  and the  various Offerings of the World  manifestly alludes to the Lady of  Loretto  You have Perfumes breathing from the  Incense Pot  in the following Line  And all  Arabia  breaths from yonder Box  The Character of  Belinda  as we take it in this third View represents the Popish Religion or the Whore of  Babylon  who is described in the State this malevolent Author wishes for coming forth in all her Glory upon the  Thames  and overspreading the Nation with Ceremonies  Not with more Glories in th'aetherial Plain  The Sun first rises o'er the purple Main  Than issuing forth the Rival of his Beams  Launch'd on the Bosom of the Silver  Thames  She is dress'd with a  Cross  on her Breast the Ensign of Popery the  Adoration  of which is plainly recommended in the following Lines  On her white Breast a sparkling  Cross  she wore  Which Jews might  kiss  and Infidels  adore  Next he represents her as the  Ʋniversal Church  according to the Boasts of the Papists  And like the Sun she shines on all alike  After which he tells us  If to her Share some Female Errors fall  Look on her Face and you'll forget them all  Tho' it should be granted some Errors fall to her share look on the pompous Figure she makes throughout the World and they are not worth regarding In the Sacrifice following soon after you have these two Lines  For this e'er  Phoebus  rose he had implor'd  Propitious Heav'n and ev'ry Pow'r ador'd  In the first of them he plainly hints at their  Matins  in the second by adoring ev'ry Power the  Invocation of Saints  Belinda  's Visits are described with numerous  WaxLights  which are always used in the Ceremonial Parts of the  Romish  Worship  Visits shall be paid on solemn Days  When num'rous Waxlights in bright Order blaze  The  Lunar Sphere  he mentions opens to us their  Purgatory  which is seen in the following Line  Since all things lost on Earth are treasur'd there  It is a Popish Doctrine that scarce any Person quits this World but he must touch at Purgatory in his way to Heaven and it is here also represented as the  Treasury  of the  Romish Church  Nor is it much to be wonder'd at that the  Moon  should be  Purgatory  when a Learned Divine hath in a late Treatise proved  Hell  to be in the  Sun  The Reverend Dr  Swinden    I shall now before I conclude desire the Reader to compare this Key with those upon any other Pieces which are supposed to be secret Satyrs upon the State either antient or modern as with those upon  Petronius Arbiter  Lucian  's true History  Barclay  's  Argenis  or  Rablais  's  Garagantua  and I doubt not he will do me the Justice to acknowledge that the Explanations here laid down are deduced as naturally and with as little force both from the general Scope and Bent of the Work and from the several Particulars and are every way as consistent and undeniable as any of those and ev'ry way as candid as any modern Interpretations of either Party on the mysterious State Treatises of our Times  To sum up my whole Charge against this Author in a few Words He has ridiculed both the present Mi  ry and the last abused great Statesmen and great Generals nay the Treaties of whole Nations have not escaped him nor has the Royal Dignity it self been omitted in the Progress of his Satyr and all this he has done just at the Meeting of a new Parliament I hope a proper Authority may be made use of to bring him to condign Punishment In the mean while I doubt not if the Persons most concern'd would but order Mr  Bernard Lintott  the Printer and Publisher of this dangerous Piece to be taken into Custody and examin'd many further Discoveries might be made both of this Poet's and his Abettor's secret Designs which are doubtless of the utmost Importance to the Government  FINIS
