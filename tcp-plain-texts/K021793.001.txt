brought together in so small a compass in any language a more copious collection of rational entertainment than will be met with in the following sheets To trace the progress of the discoveries that have successively been made in passing round the globe must fill the reader's mind with such a variety of new objects as cannot fail to raise his wonder and entertain him with infinite delight  He will in this work be safely conducted through regions that were once thought inaccessible and be made acquainted with countries altogether different from that in which he dwells Every page he reads will furnish him with novelties and every Voyage will bring him nearer to that unknown count  y in ear  h of which so many  comman  er have been sent in vain  The discovery of the western continent by Co  umbu  gave geographers reason to believe that a like con  existed somewhere in the south Without such  qu  poise they could not conceive how the globe could preserve its balance  Magell  a  n a Portuguese mariner was the first who attempted to immortalize his  by the disco  He pa  the S  that to this day bear  and entered the Pacific Oc  an where no Eu  pean vessel had ever sailed before He d  scovered the  and Phillippine Isles and returned by the Cape  Good Hope having surrounded the whole earth and proved  d  monstration the spherical figure of the globe  He was followed by navigators of different nations who emulous of his glory sought to pursue the track  had pointed out with better success but the  gers they encountered and the disasters they met  rendered the difficulties that attended the prose  tion  nsurmountable many perished and those who  ved wer  glad to return home after a fruitless search  The ill success which attended these first attempts  a damp upon the enterprize and  remained  unnoticed except in the writings of the learned  side the globe Did not the little Phoenician state reap a more glorious harvest from the discoveries of its merchants than Alexander could boast from all his conquests Was it not the perseverance of the Princes Henry John and Emanuel in supporting the charges of prosecuting new discoveries in the fifteenth century that laid the foundation of the Portuguese greatness whose territories in Europe are of no considerable extent  If the glory of aggrandizing a state and perpetuating a name to posterity be the first object of human ambition where among all the tyrants who have depopulated the earth can be produced a conqueror whose name will be remembered when that of Christopher Columbus is forgotten Or where shall we look for a monarch who after having spread murder and desolation throughout the world descended to the grave with that heartfelt satisfaction that attended the Florentine merchant Americus Vespucius when he saw all Europe agreeing with one consent to transfer his name to more than a third part of th  terr  strial globe  The success which has attended our grac  ous Monarch's first essays in the Voyages we are  about to relate though  has yet produced no  advantages to compensate the sums expen  d  the pros  cution of them yet it has been such as to open the way to new islands from whose inhabitants new arts may be learnt and from whose productions new acquisitions may be made both to the vegetable and fossil kingdom by which the regions of science may be enlarged and the gardens of the curious enriched and beautiful  It is no small satisfaction to an inquisitive mind were there no other advantage to be gained from these Voyages to be made acquainted with the genius the arts the various pursuits the customs the manners the religious nations the distin  tions of rank and the subordination that is to be met with among the people of various islands and countries distinct from each other and from  language habits learning and ways of living Who is it that can read of the poverty and misery of the wretched inhabitants of  Terra del Fuego  who have nothing but the skins of beasts loosely thrown over them to defend them from the severity  meaner sort with which their benefactors were requited  The variety of incidents that happened in the course of these Voyages when they come to be historically recited unencumbered with the jargon of seaphrases will afford a fund of entertainment seldom to be met with in the productions of the press The many singular adventures unforeseen dangers and providential escapes that every ship experienced in passing round the globe can only be conceived by those who read and believed by those who have seen the wonders of the deep  Nothing can excite or gratify curiosity more than relations of marvellous events that happen in succession and in circumstances equally critical and important The moment a ship launches into the ocean to proceed on new discoveries every man on board demands his share of attention as well as the commanding officer The story of the black who with his two companions perished on the mountains of  Terra del Fuego  is no less affecting than that of the murder of the poor Indians who set the Endeavour at defiance and bravely opposed the landing of the crew  There is not an object that presents itself either by sea or land but affords some degree of use or speculation The fish that swarm about the ship and the fowls that present themselves in the ocean are indications by which the skilful ma  er avails himself eithe  to guard against the storm or to prepare for land and the reader as circumstances arise either shares h  s danger or partakes of hi  refreshment  When the Endeavour is encircled in the wide ocean with rocks of co  her sheathing beaten off and her  floating by her side a  her bottom  fainting at the pumps what heart is so callous as not to sympathize with the de  ing crew  and anxious fo  their safety drop a  for their deliverance  And what  be the  of every  ling heart  after  hundred leagues and arriving  Batavia at  her planks  the keel and  in the ship's bottom were for six  together rubbed thinner by  er  THE INTRODUCTION  PREVIOUS to our entering upon the detail of the discoveries and adventures of the English navigators who have surrounded the globe it may perhaps afford some entertainment to the curious reader to be made acquainted with the first steps that led to so bold an undertaking and with the characters of those happy geniuses who not only conceived the plan but contributed not a little by their example to facilitate the execution  We are told that the shadow seen in the moon in the time of her eclipse first pointed out to the early navigators the true figure of the earth and that from this simple observation Columbus by revolving it in his mind deduced the possibility of passing round its surface or to speak with more precision of sailing from one side of the continent to the other for as yet one great continent and one great ocean with their appendages were thought to compose the whole material world  Full of this idea he was naturally led to conclude that by sailing in a direct course from any given point of land on one side he must of necessity arrive at another point of land in the same parallel on the opposite side provided his  provisions were proportioned to the voyage and no accident from tempests or shipwreck intervened to interrupt his progress It was on this obvious principle that Columbus founded the certainty of his discovery the infallibility of which served to support his hopes when absolute despair had seized the greatest part of his followers  It is true that though the figure of the earth was in effect conceived yet its dimensions were wholly unknown but as the road overland to the eastern coasts of the continent was no secret Columbus was persuaded that a passage by sea by a western course if no intermediate lands prevented would assuredly bring him to the same coasts From his knowledge therefore of the position of those countries from whence the rich productions of the East were circulated through all the kingdoms of the West he was led to steer first a southwest and then a direct west course which brought him among those broken fragments of the western continent which he at first mistook for the islands of the Indian Ocean and to the richest of which he imagined another voyage would certainly open a passage  The discovery being once made the principle upon which it was grounded could no longer be concealed Those belonging to the naval department about the Court of Spain who had been most violent in opposing the undertaking as appearing to them in no better light than as  the visionary conceit of some crack brained projector now assumed another tone and affected to speak of it as a discovery that required no extraordinary talents to accomplish that it was not the result of science but a thing that must follow of course to the first adventurer and that it was fortunate for Columbus that he could prevail upon their Majesties to furnish the means to undertake it as with such encouragemen  there were not wanting officers in the royal navy much better qualified to have conducted the enterprize tho' by his unparalleled assurance he had obtained the preference In this slight and contemptuous manner it was the humour at court to speak of the new discovery and though Columbus after his return was for a while caressed by the Royal Family yet the frequent repetition of these indignities could not fail in time to lessen the idea of the merit of a man who had no advocate to support his credit but the evidence of his own superior abilities At a courtentertainment however to which he was invited an incident happened that contributed not a little to heighten his character and mortify his enemies The conversation at table turned as was usual upon the importance of the new discoveries and though all seemed to agree that the advantages would be immense that must inevitably result to Spain yet little they thought was due to the first discoverer because any ordinary seaman by keeping his ship's head to the westward must have fallen in  with the same countries Columbus without seeming to regard their discourse when dinner was over and the table uncovered called for an egg and twirling it about with his hand as if by way of amusement asked if any of the company could make that egg stand upon its little end without additional support The company after trying their skill pronounced  the thing impossible  when Columbus taking it again in his hand and bruising the shell a little at bottom with his nail produced it upon the table standing upright The company all fell alaughing and one cried out that any fool could do as much as that I doubt not replied Columbus but any of you may do it now you have seen it done and so may any miserable pilot in the navy sail to the Indies now that I have pointed out the track but till the issue had shewn it practicable addressing himself to the naval gentlemen that too you pronounced an  impossible thing  The King and his royal consort particularly the latter were highly pleased when they were told this story admiring the promptness of a mind whi  h ever collected neither malice nor envy could disconcert  Other navigators equally enterprizing tho' less sagacious were now inflamed with the desire of immortalizing their names by new undertakings so that it is no wonder that the business of discovery went rapidly on for a succeeding century  It was in that Columbus made his first  expedition to the Bahama Islands and in John Cabbot in the service of England discovered the continent of North America  Columbus in his first voyage had not yet conceived the idea of a double continent but believed as we have already noted that he had discovered a passage by sea to those islands in the East that were already known by the name of the East Indies in conformity to which he gave to the islands that he discovered the appellation of the  West Indies  which they retain to this day  In having made a second voyage and carried his discoveries considerably farther to the South it is said he received some faint notions of a sea beyond a great land by which the islands he had first discovered were bounded but it was not till after his third voyage in that he attained a sight of that continent which Cabbot had discovered the year before  It may seem from what has just been said that the eastern passage to the Indian Ocean had been discovered by the Portuguese and that the East Indies were known to that people before this western discovery by Columbus but though several journies by land had been made with a view to the opening an advantageous commerce with the eastern countries by Portuguese Ambassadors well instructed in the Arabian language by whose address some progress had been made in that business yet it was not till that Bartholomew Diaz doubled the Cape of Good Hope nor till the year  the same year that the American continent was discovered by Cabbot that Don Vasquez de Gama by steering the nearest course passed the Cape which Diaz had discovered and sailed into the Indian Ocean where he afterwards made considerable conquests and by his prudent management very suddenly diverted the current of Indian commerce into an entire new channel The notion therefore that Columbus borrowed his idea of a western passage from the discoveries made by the Portuguese towards the East is ill founded These last had indeed made a considerable progress in their discoveries by land but the passages to the Eastern and Western Indies by sea were discovered about the same time without the least connection or intelligence between the respective discoverers And here we cannot help entering our protest against the honour ascribed to Columbus by Mr Campbell and other judicious naval historians as being the first circumnavigator because as Mr Campbell observes  "it was his Columbus's opinion that there was a passage from the North Sea into the South and from thence it might be very possible to sail to the East Indies"  That it was the opinion of Columbus that there was a western passage to the East Indies is readily granted it was his original idea but that there was a passage from the East Indies to Europe without returning the same way he went he could have no conception of till after the passage by the Cape of Good Hope was discovered  by the Portuguese Had he dreamt of an eastern passage  by sea  to the East Indies he would most certainly have preferred it to a western passage because it might have been performed without losing sight of land and therefore with much less risque than by launching into an immense unknown ocean of which no one could tell the extent But his notion was that the earth like a bowl inclosed the sea and that it could only be traversed from side to side by water and then from shore to shore by land Many irrefragable proofs of his having no conception of  sailing  round the globe might be adduced but that of his returning the same way back a second time without his  knowing  for certainty or  believing  there was any other sea to sail upon or having even determined the extent of that sea on which he had already ventured so far may serve without farther proof to convince the intelligent reader that Columbus had never thought of but one sea when he undertook his discovery and that that sea was only to be crossed from West to East and  vice versâ    But to proceedSoon after the eastern passage to the Indies was laid open the coast of Brazil opposite to the Cape of Good Hope was discovered by Cabral a Portuguese pilot who was driven out of his course by stress of weather The same coast was likewise discovered the same year by Yannez Pinçon who commanded a carvel that accompanied Columbus in his first expedition to the West Indies This man contested the honour of the first discovery  with Columbus and insisted that it was through his perseverance alone that land was descried the crew of Columbus having absolutely determined to steer back before the discovery took place Be that as it may this able mariner afterwards examined the coast from the Bay of Mexico to the Equinoctial Line and in the year discovered the great river of Amazons which it was thought would have opened a passage to the South Sea  In Columbus made his fourth and last expedition when he fully satisfied himself that the islands he had discovered were totally disconnected from those he went in quest of and that another continent existed besides that which was known to Europeans He was still however of opinion that a western passage to the old continent from the new would be practicable whenever a way was found to the Great Sea by which it was surrounded and now it is not at all improbable but that he might fortel what afterwards came to pass that one day or other the whole globe might be circumnavigated though he did not live to see it executed  In the Portuguese first found the way to Sumatra and from thence extended their discoveries to the Moluccas  About this time a contest arose between the Spaniards and Portuguese concerning the right of possessing countries to which neither of them had any other claim than that of being the first Europeans who happened to land upon their coasts a claim of the same kind his Otaheitean  Majesty may pretend to the western part of Europe his subject Aotourou being the first Tropical inhabitant from the S Sea that ever set foot on that continent This contest however the Pope took upon him to decide and to prevent the bloody consequences that might ensue between two such powerful competitors he published a bull which at that time of blind obedience was held decisive decreeing that whatever discoveries were made to the westward should belong to Spain and such as were made to the eastward to Portugal This seemed for a while to content both parties but in Ferdinand Magellan or Magellhanes as Mr Dalrymple affects to call him having made his famous discovery to the Molucca Islands by a new passage the contest was again revived and the competitors claimed a second time the Pope's interposition to settle the limits of their respective claims by more precise and determinate boundaries The claims of the Spaniards were now extended to near three parts of the globe and those of the Portuguese which by a false representation had been much diminished were now to be restored or rather regulated by a more exact standard The two contending powers were to divide the globe between them by what was then stiled a line of demarkacion This  line  was to cut the globe into two hemispheres and was to be acknowledged a  first  meridian all the discoveries in the western hemisphere were to belong to Spain and all in the  eastern to Portugal But still there arose a dispute about the precise spot where this meridian line should be fixed By the Pope's bull it had been placed leagues to the westward of St Antonio one of the islands of Cape Verde but by this new regulation it was removed leagues farther to the west This alteration was intended to deprive Portugal of the possession of the Moluccas but the Portuguese pilots were not to be thus deceived they suffered the line of demarkacion to be fixed but when it was finally determined they insisted on their right to the Moluccas as still within their limits and future observations have since confirmed their claims But notwithstanding the justice of their claims if justice can at all be admitted to exist in cases of usurpation the Spaniards held the Moluccas till when the Portuguese purchased an exclusive right of trading to them by a loan of ducatsBut to return from this digression  We have already observed that the coast of Brazil and the river of Amazons was first discovered by Yannez Pinçon in but it was not till twelve years afterwards that John de Solis discovered the river Plate  In Vasco Nunez de Bilboa got sight of the Great South Sea from the mountains of Pancas in the province of Panama and from that time Ferdinand Magellan a Portuguese officer conceived the design of surrounding the globe by finding a passage by which he might  enter that sea He now began to consider the earth as divided into two continents with their concomitant seas and as a promontory was found by the doubling of which one continent might be visited on both sides he made no doubt but that another promontory existed by which the other might be visited in like manner Perhaps the idea of a strait might not at first strike his mind till the opening at Cape Virgin suggested it His original thought was to coast along to the southward as the land trended and by perseverance he persuaded himself that a boundary would be found by which the land of the new continent would be terminated though he did not nor could not then ascertain to what height it might reach He had in view a nearer way to the Moluccas than that by the Cape of Good Hope and he at first imparted his views to the Ministers of his Court who probably suspecting that by such a passage the right to the Moluccas might be brought in question by Spain treated his project with a contemptuous neglect To a man full of the importance of such a discovery nothing could be more mortifying He determined since he was so coolly received at home to try his fortune abroad For this purpose he repaired to the court of Spain where after making himself known to the leading Minister he undertook to prove the Moluccas and other rich islands then reputed in the East to be within the Spanish line of demarkacion to the  West and by a new passage to them he engaged to confirm the truth of what he advanced incontestibly  These propositions after being properly examined and approved by the ablest astronomers and geographers at that time in Spain was eagerly embraced by the Emperor Charles the Fifth an enterprizing Prince who then held the kingdom and who gave him audience in the councilchamber at Saragossa and conferred upon him and his companion Ruy Falero the order of St Jago both of whom his Imperial Majesty honoured with the title of  his Captains    This encouragement and these honours could not fail to alarm the Court of Portugal but all the interest and opposition which Alvaro de Acasto the Portuguese Ambassador could make had no effect the preparations for the voyage were prosecuted with more than ordinary diligence and five ships were soon got in readiness to put to sea  But previous to their setting sail a difference  concerning the necessary forms of commons which had well nigh ruined the voyage before it was undertaken the honour of carrying the royal st  ndard was contested by Ruy Falero and some other indignities were offered to Magellan on account of his country These however were redressed by the interposition of the imperial authority Ruy Falero was persuaded to suspend his departure on account of his health and Magellan was declared General  of the squadron which was now committed to his sole direction  On the th of August this little fleet consisting of the Admiral's ship the St Antonio Capt Juan de Cartagena ViceAdmiral the Victoria Capt Luys de Mendoça RearAdmiral the St Jago Capt Juan Rodriguez Serrano and the Conception of which Gasper de Quezada was Master left Cadiz and proceeded to Teneriff from whence they took their departure on the d of September and on the th of December arrived at Rio de Janeiro on the coast of Brazil where they staid till the th and after being plentifully supplied with all necessary refreshments at a very moderate price they weighed anchor and continued their voyage in the course of which much discontent arose concerning the track they were to steer but on Easter evening they entered St Julian river and were next day ordered on shore by the General to hear mass Three of the Captains refused to obey namely Luys de Mendoça Gasper de Quezada and Juan de Cartagena this last being already in arrest for disrespect to his General  Their disobedience put Magellan on his guard He perceived that the majority both of officers and men were averse to the undertaking and that a general murmuring prevailed throughout the whole squadron Only a few trusty friends were ready to support their General and willing to follow wherever he should  lead The weather was now set in very severe and the Spaniards unused to the rigour of such a climate were hardly to be restrained They represented the inutility of proceeding as they were already in a climate too boisterous and inclement to be navigated by Spaniards that it could never be the Emperor's intention to sacrifice the lives of his subjects without the least prospect of advantage to the State and that now it was manifest though the discovery were certain the navigation would be impracticable and therefore useless To these representations and others more full of asperity Magellan coolly made answer  "that he was determined to die rather than return back that he should pass the winter where he then was and that neither provisions nor wine should be wanting to those who would be contented with a moderate allowance but that if any persisted in spreading discontents and encouraging disobedience he knew how to punish as well as to reward"  Barros says that the three Captains  Cartogena Quezada  and  Mendoça  conspired together to kill Magellan and to return and make their report of the usage they had met with and the hardships they had endured in the voyage but Magellan considering the danger and that in certain circumstances  temerity  is better than  caution  ordered the people of his own ship to arms and manning his boat with thirty trusty friends he clapt the Victoria aboard and while Mendoça  was reading a letter directed to him from the General the messenger that delivered it stabbed him to the heartThe moment the order was executed the thirty men entered to the assistance of the assassin and quietly took possession of the ship This done a council of war was called and a conspiracy was detected in which more than forty of the principal people on board the several ships were found to be deeply concerned but Magellan that he might not appear too sanguinary or vindictive sentenced  Quezada  only to be executed and  Cartagena  to be left on shore accompanied by a French Priest a punishment that probably was worse than immediate death as it subjected the criminals to hardships which instant execution would have prevented Mendoça and Quezada he ordered to be quartered as traitors to strike the disaffected with the greater terror This put an end to all opposition for the present  When the winter months drew towards a conclusion Magellan was vigilant to hasten the departure of his fleet and as soon as the cold abated he dispatched Serrano to coast along the shore to make observations Serrano at about twenty leagues distance found a river a league broad at the entrance which he named St Cruz because he fell in with it on that Saint's day In examining this river and in fishing for seals he spent six days at the end of which a furious storm arose which split his sails and drove his ship on shore where she bulged and was beaten  to pieces The crew however were saved but reduced to the last extremity for want of food Two of the company undertook to travel over land to give the General notice of the miserable situation of their fellowsufferers and after days fatigue they at length surmounted every difficulty and accomplished their purpose Magellan pitying their distresses sent a vessel with provisions which came seasonably to their relief  The time for sailing being now come and the ships in readiness they left the bay of St Julian on the th of August after setting Juan de Cartagena and Pedro Sanchez de Revora the Priest who was also found deep in the plot ashore on that desolate coast They supplied them plentifully with bread and wine but as they were never afterwards heard of there can be no doubt of their perishing miserably  The squadron consisting now of four ships kept coasting along to the southward with imminent danger of shipwreck till towards the latter end of October when they fell in with a promontory which the General named Cape Virgin because it was discovered on St Ursula'sday This Cape opened an inlet which Magellan judged favourable to his design He cast anchor at the entrance of the inlet and ordered two ships to examine its course In five days these ships returned and one of them affirmed it was a strait because the flood was greater than the ebb the other reported that  they saw nothing but inlets and breakers The General on these different relations determined to sail into the opening in order to be more precisely informed He accordingly weighed and came to an anchor in a commodious bay where he first sent his skiff with men to reconnoitre the shore and then the St Antonio to trace out the inlet to a certain distance When the men returned from the shore they said they had found a buryingplace with more than graves and had seen the skeleton of a whale in a cove upon the beach but had seen neither house nor inhabitant The Captain of the St Antonio on his return gave a more flattering account He said he had followed the inlet for more than leagues that its course was due east and west and that he made not the least doubt but that it was the passage so much desired This news was received with repeated acclamations A council was called of the chief officers and pilots in which a very warm debate arose whether in the circumstances the ships were then in it were better to return to Spain having obtained the main object of the voyage or to proceed to complete what the General had undertaken to perform namely to trace out a western passage to the Molucca Islands Estevan Gomez the pilot of the St Antonio a man of excellent parts and sound judgment insisted on returning back and bringing another squadron to complete the discovery alledging that they had still a great  and unknown sea to pass and that if either tempests or calms intervened to retard their passage over it the whole fleet must inevitably perish His opinion was supported by the whole council Magellan only excepted who declared that if he were sure to be reduced to the necessity of eating the hides that covered the yards he would persevere in the discovery He accordingly gave orders for weighing anchor immediately and proceeding down the strait sent the Antonio to examine some inlets that promised a nearer passage to the main ocean than that they were pursuing but the pilot Gomez and the purser Guerra seized and stabbed Alvara de Mesquita the Commander and carried home the ship In the mean time Magellan supposing some disaster had befallen her went himself in pursuit of her but after six days fruitless search he determined to continue his voyage  "and it pleased God says my author that at the end of twenty days he entered into the Great South Sea and was the first who had found the passage so much sought after whereby the memory of this excellent Captain shall be eternally celebrated"  Finding that the land trended northwards Magellan directed his course accordingly that he might as soon as possible clear those cold and dreary coasts that had caused so much murmuring among the mariners and so much caballing among the officers but before he reached the Tropic he met with most tempestuous  map of west coast of South America  weather by which the three remaining ships were very much shattered in their sails and rigging In this passage they discovered two uninhabited islands St Pedro and Tiburon about the situation of which mariners are still divided and it has been questioned whether either of them have since been seen  As they approached the Line they found the wind to stand fair Magellan then ordered the ships to change their course and steer N W and W N W till he reached the Line  Harris takes notice that it was on the th of December when Magellan entered the Great South Sea and that in this wide ocean the ships that accompanied him sailed three months and twenty days without seeing any other land than the two islands just mentioned which afforded them no refreshment At length when they had undergone all the miseries that human nature is capable of sustaining from hunger thirst and sickness they fell in with the Ladrone islands where they landed but where the inhabitants were such thieves that they were in fear left their ships should be pulled to pieces and carried away before their faces the crews not having strength enough left to defend either their lives or their properties They therefore shortened their stay among these plunderers and were more fortunate in their next attempt  On the th of March landing on the island of Zamal they found springs of delicate water which to them were more precious than fountains  of the choicest wines fruit in abundance that surpassed any they had till then tasted and inhabitants humane and civil who pitying their distresses brought their richest productions to relieve them From this island they continued to steer between the west and southwest till they arrived at Buthuan or as it has since been called Buton the King of which gave them honourable entertainment They visited several other isles and in all of them were well received till at length coming to the Isle of Mathan they were attacked by an army of Indians against whom the General himself being engaged was shot with a poisoned arrow and afterwards pierced in the head with a lance and thus ended the life and actions of this gallant Commander whose name will be perpetuated with honour to latest posterity After his death a company of his followers being invited to an entertainment on shore were treacherously murdered by a pretended friendly King and only Don Juan Serrano of all who landed was reserved alive in order to procure a large supply of firearms and ammunition by way of ransom but those who remained on board fearful of being trepanned would have no farther intercourse with the perfidious infidels so that poor Serrano was left to their mercy Those on board the ships in number directed their course towards the Moluccas and arrived at Teridore one of the principal of those islands on the th of November Here they  were hospitably received and here they staid till the middle of January and being now come into wellknown seas we shall accompany them no farther only remarking that of the whole squadron only one ship namely the Victoria had the good fortune to return to Spain and of officers and seamen the complement at first setting out if we except those who returned in the St Antonio of whom we have no account only Spaniards survived to return to Seville Their Commander John Sebastian Cano was received with extraordinary marks of favour by the Emperor who gave him for arms the Terrestrial Globe with this motto  Primus me circumdedistis  and otherwise liberally rewarded him The voyage he lived to make took up three years and thirtyseven days and is perhaps the most remarkable that ever was performed  This voyage opened a new field for discovery the Spaniards who were already settled on the western coasts of America were very curious to examine what countries might be situated along that vast space which divided the new continent from the old and accordingly Cortez the celebrated conqueror of Peru fitted out two ships for the purpose the command of one of which he gave to Ferdinand Grijalva the other to Don Alvarado  Grijalva departed from Pageta in deg N lat about the beginning of April and steered W and S W into deg S lat where  his ship springing her mast he stood again to the Line in which tract a mutiny happening among the crew Grijalva and his nephew were both assassinated and the ship after a passage of four months was carried to Papua where falling to pieces the crew reduced by famine and fatigue to seven men took to their boat and coasted along the shore till being boarded by a number of Indians it was sunk The Spaniards however were saved by the humanity of the captors and sold for slaves This ship it is affirmed sailed leagues on both sides the Line without seeing land Among the islands however which they afterwards fell in with before they came to Papua was that called Isla de los Pescadores called in the late voyages BYRON's ISLAND and supposed to be a new discovery  Alvarado was instructed to pursue his discoveries along the Line without deviating either to the right or left farther than the most advantageous method of navigating his ship required and in that direction he discovered the islands of Papua He also discovered other islands named the Guelles in deg N lat east and west from Teronate and leagues from that of Moro with Hamei leagues from Tidore and many others that have since been thought new discoveries After his return he was again employed upon services of the like kind and was instrumental in establishing the trade of Manilla  But of all the Spanish discoveries that have been made or pretended to have been made in the South Seas that of Juan Fernandez who first pointed out the way from Lima to Chili by sailing to the westward  if real  is by far the most important This pilot the same who discovered the island which still bears his name in the latitude of deg S was brought as it is said in courses between west and southwest upon the coast of a continent from what he could judge very fertile and delightful inhabited by white people hospitable and welldisposed of a middle stature dressed in very fine cloaths and so peaceable and civil that in every way they could express they endeavoured to gratify the strangers and to accommodate them with the best things their country afforded the fruits whereof were excellent and abounding in the greatest profusion It is added that being overjoyed with having discovered the coast of that great continent so much talked of and so ardently sought after he returned to Chili intending to make a second voyage properly fitted out to improve this fortunate discovery to his own and his country's enrichment but before he could persuade his friends to give entire credit to his report he died and the secret of the precise situation of his new continent perished with him for it has never since been found though Mr Alexander Dalrymple author of an Historical Collection of Voyages to the South Pacific Ocean whose opinion is of no small  weight is persuaded that Fernandez did discover the SOUTHERN CONTINENT and that whenever it is again visited it will be no new discovery but a confirmation of the existence of that land which has already been found  But besides this dubious discovery there is still another which has not yet been clearly ascertained and about which geographers are much divided This discovery is attributed to Alvaro Mendana who in is said to have fallen in with a cluster of islands abounding with gold and pearl which were named by him the Isles of Salomon and for the settling of which an unsuccessful attempt was made by Mendana himself and a second strongly solicited by Pedro Fernandez de Quiros the chief pilot who accompanied that General and who afterwards made a voyage thither on his own account in which he made many discoveries  It was in April that Mendana left Callao in Peru to settle the Salomon Isles He had with him two large ships a galleasta and a frigate on board of which were embarked from Lima followers including women and children Of this embarkation Lope de la Vega his brotherinlaw was Admiral Pedro Fernandez de Quiros chief pilot and Pedro Merino Manriquez Maitre de Campo According to Figueroa who wrote an account of this voyage the Admiral's ship was named the St Isabella Mendana's ship the St Jerome the galleasta St Philippe and the frigate St  Catalina of the two last the Commanders were Capt Philip Corço and Lieut Alonzo de Leyla In this expedition Mendana was accompanied by his Lady Donna Isabella Barretos with her three brothers and after parting company with the Admiral's ship the very night they came in sight of the island on which they settled Mendana cast anchor in a bay which he called  la Graciosa  and the island he named Santa Cruz Here on the th of October the Maitre de Campo and Thomas de Ampuero were hanged and Ensign Jean de Buy beheaded for mutinous behaviour and here Mendana himself died the th of the same month Don Lorenzo brother to Donna Isabella who by the loss of the Admiral had succeeded as CaptainGeneral died also on the d of November and in less than seven days after Father Antonio de Serra Chief Priest and Juan de Espinosa his Vicar In short from change of climate food and customs from labour going in the sun being wet without having wherewithal to shift themselves sleeping on the ground and from other disorders and sufferings dangerous diseases attacked the whole company they began to die apace it being lamentable to see them in their distress creeping into huts some delirious and others at the last gasp some going to the ships to seek health others shifting from the ships to the shore but no remedy nor any physician to apply to for relief In this calamitous state things were when Donna Isabella on the th  of October broke up the settlement and embarking the few people that remained alive on board the St Jerome the frigate and the galleasta they set sail intending to pursue their course to Manilla but the frigate soon lost company and it is said was afterwards found on a defart coast with all her sails set and the people on board dead and rotten and the galleasta put into an island near the coast of Mindanao The St Jerome however after suffering unspeakable hardships got to Manilla where Donna Isabella married Don Ferdinando de Castro and returned in his ship to New Spain the very next year The Admiral's ship was never heard ofThus ended this unfortunate expedition  The island of Santa Cruz in which this settlement was attempted is said to be leagues in circumference and to lie E S E and W N W in lat deg min S distant from Lima leagues They cast anchor on the north side of it in a harbour to the north of which is a volcano or burning mountain that from its top frequently casts forth fire and from the inside of which proceeds a noise sometimes louder than thunder To the west of the harbour is a small island about four leagues in compass separated from the great island by sunken rocks and banks of sand The port is formed at the bottom of the bay by a great river and the country round it is fine and plentiful A more exact description than this one would think could not have been given  Quiros who navigated Donna Isabella first to Manilla and afterwards accompanied her to New Spain was so charmed with the beautiful appearance of these enchanting islands that he continued for the space of ten years incessantly to weary the Court of Spain with memorial after memorial to renew the settlement of them and at length he prevailedPrevious to his voyage he spent several months in building two ships and a zebra the stourest and best equipped with men provisions and warlike stores of any that had ever been fitted out in New Spain He was accompanied by six Franciscan Fathers with whom he took his departure on the st of December and sailing without any material incident till the th of January he on that day fell in with an island to the southwest just leagues from the coast of Peru in lat deg S which island he unluckily found uninhabited From this island he sailed on different courses passing several inaccessible islands till the th of February on which day a sailor joyfully cried out  Land ahead  Here on their landing they surprized a woman but so old in appearance that it was matter of astonishment that she could stand upright In her youthful days it was easy to perceive that she had been of a graceful mien and she still retained a dignity about her that shewed she was of quality Being asked by signs to go on board she complied without hesitation and when there she eat of whatever was given  her and received presents with a becoming ease After cloathing this lady very fine they set her on shore and on her landing the people flocked about her and among them a tall stout wellmade man who had on his head a plume of feathers and by his deportment appeared to be a Chief Him they endeavoured to entice on board but when he came to the ship's side fearing treachery he refused to enter Quiros directed that no force might be used made him some presents and dismissed him This island by observation was in deg min S and was named by Quiros Sagitaria They left it on the th after some skirmishes with the inhabitants and passing by several other islands in which they could procure no refreshment on the d of March they fell in with an island which promised fair to supply their wants Here on their attempting to land they were accosted by about Indians the tallest genteelest whitest and strongestmade people they had ever yet seen but though they shewed fair in countenance they were in fact the cruellest enemies they had to encounter in the whole voyage One of them in a swift canoe approached the ship singly and brandishing his lance made those kind of contortions with his face arms and legs by which Parkinson has remarked the SouthSea Indians provoke their enemies to battle he even mounted the balcony of the Admiral's ship and with his lance made a thrust at one of the officers on the quarterdeck  with an intent to kill him and instantly leaping into his canoe rowed off at a great rate He repeated his visits and his insolence but it was not long before they shot him dead While this was passing on board the Admiral the zebra that had cast anchor near the shore was still in a worse situation surrounded by a multitude of fierce barbarians who having fastened a rope to her head were endeavouring to drag her on shore but perceiving that the people on board were preparing to cut the rope they pushed a little off and were fastening it to the cable when a volley of small arms was discharged among them by which some were killed some wounded and all terribly frightened this however failed of the desired effect for neither kindness nor chastisement could prevail upon them to furnish the ships with water or provisions so that they were obliged to set sail without a supply of either This island lies north and south and was called by Quiros the Island of Handsome People  They now pursued their course for the island of Santa Cruz without interruption till the th of April when they discovered land bearing W N W high and black like a volcano but night coming on they stood off till next morning and then sent the zebra to look out for a safe harbour for the ships to cast anchor On the th she returned having succeeded and about noon the same day the ships were moored in fathom water to the great joy of the  desponding crew The boats were instantly dispatched to make peace with the natives and before night they returned with water plantains cocoanuts potatoes palmetos and sugarcanes than which the riches of Potosi could not have been more welcome They next day discovered a fort constructed by art the materials of coral stone in which were about houses surrounded by the sea and designed as a refuge from enemies whenever an invasion was threatened by the warlike inhabitants of the adjoining country To this fort they made their next approach and lest they should meet with opposition they took care to be properly armed but the inhabitants were desirous of nothing so much as peace and received them hospitably so different are the dispositions of people inhabiting the same climate and separated only by a portion of the sea Here they were supplied at an easy rate with wood and water in the shipping of which they were assisted by the friendly natives and here they had plenty of the fruits and provisions which the country produced in return for which the grateful Spaniards seized four of the natives with a view to carry them off but in spite of their vigilance three made their escape and only one c  ntinued with them who being a slave where he  cared but little what master he served in that capacity  At the end of seven days the people being pretty well refreshed Quiros again set sail and on the st of April passed an island in lat  degrees S which the Indians called Tuoopia They now approached the islands of which they were in quest and on the th a consultation was held on board the Admiral to consider which of the lands in sight they would chuse to settle when it was concluded not to return to Santa Cruz but to stand to the southward in search of that great land of which they had heard so much This they did passing many islands some of considerable extent some small but very populous and all of them exhibiting a most delightful prospect of woods lawns inclosures and waterfalls till at length in lat deg min S they came to a land stretching from east to west to the extent of which they could see no end On the zebra's approaching this land the people on board were not a little surprized to see an Indian come down from the mountains and without invitation throw himself into the sea and make towards the ship A boat was immediately hoisted out in order to take him up but as he appeared spirited and strong and made the usual contortions by way of defiance it was judged proper to confine him by clapping a chain upon his legs to prevent mischief In this manner they purposed to have carried him on board the Admiral who wanted to get some native in his power to use with kindness in order to facilitate a peace but perceiving their intent and concluding that his imprisonment was a prelude to his death he seized in his passage a  favourable opportunity and snapping his chains with his hands leapt suddenly into the sea Night coming on it was in vain to pursue him and accordingly they continued their course to acquaint the Admiral with what had happened They had scarce been an hour on board when the watch on the forecastle called out  A voice  and knowing it to be that of a native they instantly handed him up when to the great surprize of the boat's crew who had just come on board they perceived by the remains of the chain about his leg that it was the man who had made his escape He was quite exhausted with swimming and chose rather to surrender to the strangers than perish in the sea He was kindly received had wine and sweetmeats given him put to bed and in the morning was richly cloathed in taffety and sent on shore in return for which civilities he caused a number of hogs to be sent on board with plantains and other fruits but at the same time he gave his benefactors to understand that he was not to be diverted from the defence of his country by the dissembled kindness of pretended friends When therefore the Spaniards attempted to land a few Indians headed by this gallant Chief appeared upon the shore and feigning to conduct them to an open beach led them along the skirts of a wood where a numerous body of natives lay concealed who watching their opportunity let fly a volley of poisoned arrows by which however one Spaniard only was wounded in the face  The Spaniards returned the compliment by a discharge of musquetry but the opposition they expected from these  uncivilized barbarians  for so they are called for defending their country deterred them from prosecuting their design They returned to their ships without setting foot on shore and on their return finding themselves mistaken it was thought proper again to put to sea in search of that great country and that friendly people of whose happy situation they had heard so much  On the th of April about three in the afternoon steering southwest they discovered land right ahead and before night came up with it In the morning the zebra was sent along shore to examine the soundings and after twelve hours absence returned and made report that they had found a spacious bay and had exchanged some trifles with a people of an enormous size who nevertheless appeared to be good natured and desirous of peace This news gave universal satisfaction The ships followed their pilot and it being the day of St Philip and St James when they arrived they called the bay by that name Here they found a most delightful port situated between two noble rivers the one they named the Jordan and the other Salvador the people numerous and friendly the climate mild and serene and the air so wholesome that in a few days all the sick recovered The soil they afterwards found fruitful to a degree of luxuriance the woods  and plains abounding with herds and beasts of various kinds and the seas well stored with fish In short nothing was wanting to complete their wishes but a more numerous company to secure possession On their first landing the Spaniards were hospitably received but when it was perceived by their overtures for peace that they intended to prolong their stay a jealousy arose that they came with no good design and they were treated afterwards as enemies and invaders All friendly intercourse very soon ceased the market for provisions was stopt and nothing was to be obtained to subsist upon but by force or stratagem While they were on these terms an incident happened that it was thought would at once have put an end to their fears and their hopes Among the vegetables which grew wild and on which they were obliged chiefly to live they had gathered some poisonous plants of which the people in general had eaten and all who had eaten soon began to feel the direful effects The symptoms were the more alarming as all parts of the flesh seemed to partake of the noxious quality of the plants The ships were like the hospitals of a city infected with the plague where the numbers of the healthy were not sufficient to administer to the infirmities of the sick Nothing in short was to be heard but lamentations and supplications all expected to die without remedy But their fears as it fell out were greater than their danger for after a certain  time the violence of the poison abated and the sick were restored to a more vigorous state of health than they enjoyed before But they were scarce relieved from this misfortune when another succeeded Despairing of ever being able to reconcile themselves to the natives at this port they set sail after having founded a city between the  Jordan  and the  Salvador  to which they had given the name of  New Jerusalem  Coasting towards the south with a view to find a more fortunate settlement they were overtaken by a most dreadful storm in which the ships were separated The Admiral was driven off the coast and never again returned but the other ship and the zebra with difficulty returned to port What afterwards became of them we are not told Quiros after attempting in vain to rejoin them made the best of his way to New Spain and on his arrival undertook a voyage to Old Spain where he continued to solicit the Court for a new embarkation but he died before he could obtain it  From this time the Spaniards seem to have given over all thoughts of a settlement in those islands to the true situation of which they appear at this day to be strangers Neither have other nations been more successful in their attempts to discover them for unless as Mr Alexander Dalrymple has endeavoured to prove in his Historical Collection of Voyages to the South Pacific Ocean they are the same with those which Dampier has dignified with the name of  New Britain no others have yet been found that answer to their description To Mr Dalrymple's data there can be only one objection and that is this Quiros in his memorial to the Court of Spain reporting the voyage of Mendana says that in prosecuting his discoveries he fell in with four islands the Marquessas inhabited by so good a people that there is no account of any other having ever been found equal to them and that these islands were leagues from Lima from the nearest coast of New Spain and leagues from New Guinea Here the distance from Lima to New Guinea is precisely fixed by Quiros but at the same time it is to be noted that the distance from Lima to the isles in question are as precisely fixed and in the same memorial they are said to be between the th and th degrees of south latitude leagues from the city of Lima Thus they are placed by Quiros precisely in the midway between the Marquessas and New Guinea whereas the isles called New Britain are divided by Dampier from New Guinea to the eastward only by a strait  But this by the byeWe shall now proceed to relate what other material discoveries have been made by other nations in the southern hemisphere particularly by the DutchLe Maire and Schouten left the Texel on June the th and passing Strait Le Maire January on the th of April the same year fell in with an island in latitude deg  min S miles from the coast of Peru to which they gave the name of DOG ISLAND Pursuing their coast to the isles of Salomon on the th they came to another island in lat deg min S to which they gave the name of WATERLAND because in this island tho' uninhabited they found a supply of fresh water and some herbs of which they gathered sackfuls to make pottage to refresh the men who were now much afflicted with the scurvy  On the d of May they saw many dolphins the first they had seen in the SouthSeas  On the th after passing several uninhabited islots they discovered an island in lat deg min S where they had an engagement with the natives whom they found to be great thieves they were however very handsome their limbs wellproportioned of large stature quite naked excellent swimmers and very active This island they called Cocos Island because they were here plentifully supplied with that fruit A league from it lay another which they named Traitors Island because the inhabitants had formed a design to cut them off  On the th having sailed near miles from the coast of Peru without discovering the least appearance of a southern land or falling in with the so much celebrated Isles of Salomon and being in lat deg min S it was there considered in full council what course to steer next when it was determined to return home by the well known track to the northward of New Guinea  In pursuit of this resolution they changed their course to the N N W and on the d being in lat deg min S they fell in with an island which by its beautiful appearance promised fair to afford refreshment Sending the shallop to sound they found fathom sand and shells in a kind of bason overagainst a small river issuing from a valley edged with trees This gave unspeakable pleasure to the whole company  On the d they moored the ship and while they were yet busy they were visited by whole troops of the natives who expressed their admiration a thousand different ways At length a venerable old man approached the ship and with great gravity made an oration at the conclusion of which the people who surrounded him expressed their approbation by general acclamations A traffic for provisions now commenced and after a pretty sharp skirmish in which half a dozen natives were killed by the musquetry the same was continued till their departure with great civility and honesty The Chiefs of the island after an exchange of hostages came on board and were magnificently entertained They were given to understand that the ships were in want of water and they made their people assist in supplying their wants They caused hogs dogs fowls and fruits to be sent in plenty which were exchanged for nails beads dolls and lookingglasses As a present when the Chiefs returned to shore they sent to  HornIsland  the Commander two hogs ready drest they had taken out the entrails and put in the place of them burning stones to roast them in the inside and sweet herbs to make them savoury In short their manners their desires their behaviour their customs their habitations and their arts so exactly correspond with what has lately been reported of the inhabitants of the supposed newly discovered islands in the South Seas that there does not remain a doubt but that this island which the Dutch named Hoorne Island together with the adjoining island which they called the Island of Good Hope are two of those that lie between the th and th degrees of south latitude of which our late voyagers have given so flattering an account One particular reported by the Dutch is strikingly characteristic The men say they were valiant and large in stature the tallest among them surpassing very much in height the tallest of ours  their women were not handsome but so totally destitute of shame that what modesty requires to be done in privacy they performed with their men in public by way of entertainment before their Kings  In the new map accompanying Hawkesworth's Voyages King George's Island is placed in the latitude of deg min S long deg min W In the Dutch maps Hoorne Island is placed in lat deg min S long deg min W from Arica on the coast of Peru which answers to long deg min W from London being only deg min more to the west and  min more to the south than King George's Island a difference very inconsiderable indeed allowing for the difference of time from to and for the improvement that has been made in the instruments of navigation during that period particularly in those for ascertaining longitude  On the st of June as has been already observed they took their departure from Hoorne Island highly pleased with their kind reception and on the th came in sight of the coast of New Guinea  We should have mentioned that Schouten was of opinion that Hoorne Island was one of the Salomon Isles mentioned by Quiros none other they had met with having answered so well to the Spanish description of them  The next remarkable voyage undertaken professedly with a view to discovery in the southern hemisphere is that of Abel Jansan Tasman who in sailed from Batavia in the East Indies and touched at the Isles of Mauritius in latitude deg min South long deg min East On the th of October the same year he left the Mauritius and keeping a southerly course on the th of September fell in with the land to which he gave the name of Anthony Van Diemen's land in deg min S long deg min E Here they met with much bad weather which obliged them to steer eastward and on the st of December they anchored in lat deg  min S long deg min E in a bay to which they gave the name of Frederic Henry's bay Their whole force consisted only of a small ship about tons named the Hemskirk and the Zee Haan pink for examining the coast Here they landed but could discover no human being though they had reason to believe the country was inhabited They gathered plenty of good potherbs that grew wild and saw trees full two fathom and an half in the girt and from to feet high in which steps had been cut for the purpose of climbing them five feet distant from each other and from this circumstance they concluded that the inhabitants must be men of gigantic stature  On the th of December Tasman pursued his course in search of the Salomon Isles and on the th had sight of a very high and mountainous country now well known by the name of New Zealand By its lofty appearance he judged it to be the southern continent and coasted it along to the north eastward till on the th of December he came to a spacious bay three or four miles in breadth in lat deg min S long deg min from whence he could discern on the shore men of a strong robust make partly clothed and partly naked to whom he made signals inviting them on board but none of them would venture to approach within the reach of a peteraro It was therefore resolved to go to them  but before that resolution could be carried into execution the barbarians made an attack upon the Zee Haan's boat and murdered most of the crew in the manner related in the course of the work  Not caring to sacrifice any more of his people against a barbarous race of manslayers he weighed anchor and pursued his voyage along the coast till he came to an island in latitude deg min S which he named THREE KING'S ISLAND where some of his people landed and where they saw at a distance about men of an uncommon stature who called to them in a very gruff tone of voice and approached them hastily with prodigious strides The Dutchmen being few in number thought fit to retreat Their business being that of discovery not of war the Captain thought fit to quit that inhospitable coast and direct his course to the islands of Cocos or Hoorne where he was sure of refreshing his men and supplying their wants without danger of bloodshed happy that he could find a passage into an open sea On this coast however he observed many fair plantations handsomely laid out and to all appearance well cultivated  On the th of January he discovered three islands to which he gave names The southernmost he called Pylstaart's Island the middlemost Amsterdam and the most northerly Middleburgh This last lay in lat deg min S long deg minutes  At these islands which seemed remote from any other land they trafficked for provisions and the inhabitants who were of a tawney complexion and somewhat above the common size behaved very civilly and shewed no signs of a hostile disposition Among the natives of these islands came a lusty man with a St Thomas's arm and a woman with a natural beard A venerable old man came also among the rest and made an oration after which a croud of men and women young and old came on board with all kinds of provisions It is remarkable that among all the islands in the South Seas the only tame fourfooted animals are hogs and dogs and of these the inhabitants here had plenty They found another island at no great distance equally abounding in the usual productions besides being plentifully supplied with water It appears strange to us that the people in those hot climates can subsist without fresh water yet nature seems in part to have supplied that defect by furnishing a fruit that both allays thirst and assuages hunger and that too without either art or labour By vegetables suited to their subsistence it should seem that the animals indigenous to the climate are nourished and made fat Indeed where springs brooks and lakes are wanting the forests have few if any inhabitants but if we may credit the relations of voyagers the people have hogs and dogs where they have neither river well or lake  for though in Amsterdam Island the strangers might have purchased hogs a day for a few baubles yet a can of fresh water was not to be procured at any rate In an island called by the natives Annamokka but by the Dutch Rotterdam water was found in plenty yet it was no better inhabited than the islands before mentioned which seemed to be wholly without Rotterdam Island is placed in lat deg min S long deg min To this island they repaired to take in water and there they compleated their stock of fresh provisions finding the people courteous and civil though somewhat inclined to be thievish Being now fully refreshed and provided without making any further discoveries worth relating they returned to Java by the way of New Guinea  Jacob Roggewein was the next Dutchman who sailed professedly on the business of discovery He was furnished by their EastIndia Company with three ships namely the Eagle the Tienh  n and the African Galley with these he set sail from Amsterdam July the th and towards the latter end of November came in sight of the coast of Brazil After a few days stay in the neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro he weighed and went in quest of Hawkins's Maiden Land which is said to lie in deg S but not being able to find it he pursued his course towards the straits till on the st of December in lat deg S the ships met with a violent storm in which the  Tienhoven lost company About the beginning of January Roggewein discovered a large island leagues in circuit in lat deg S long deg W about leagues from the coast of America He named this island BELCIA AUSTRALIS and it is the same now known by the name of Falkland's Island Leaving this island to windward he passed the strait of Le Maire and on the th of February came in sight of Juan Fernandez where he fortunately found the Tienhoven that island having been he place appointed to rendezvous in case of separation  There the ships continued three weeks and sailed from thence about the middle of March steering W N W in search of Davis's Land which however they could not find Neither has that or Hawkins's Maiden Land ever been seen by any other navigator except the first discoverers Being in lat deg S long deg they saw many birds and other tokens of high land but to the astonishment of the Admiral came in sight of none till they had sailed leagues farther west They then discovered an island which they called EASTERISLAND because they came in sight of it on Easterday They found this island well inhabited The  an that came on board was painted with various kinds of figures was of a brown complexion with large ears so long that they hung down to his shoulders He was tall robust active of an agreeable countenance and  lively diposition They offered him wine but he threw it in his eyes They gave him meat cloathed him and sent him on shore but afterwards killed him in a skirmish with his countrymen On this island they observed many idols and saw one man quite white whom they took to be a priest He had pendents in his ears a pound weight each On landing in number the natives crouded so close upon them that they were forced to fire upon them to keep them off By this discharge several were killed and many wounded These poor people seeing their friends bleed and fall dead filled the air with doleful cries and lamentations and brought offerings of fruits roots and fowls to appease the wrath of the invaders To implore the bodies of their murdered friends they cast themselves on the earth and made other signs of supplication They were indulged in their timidity and it was held a crime to approach a Dutchman without reverence when they brought them presents they laid them at their feet  This country was full of inclosures and seemed neatly cultivated The people had coverings of a manufacture that felt soft like silk The women in general were painted with a rouge far surpassing in brightness any thing of that colour known in Europe they were very obliging and enticed the strangers to every kind of familiarity both by their looks and gestures Their idols were chiefly of stone  wellproportioned and wrought with exquisite workmanship While they lay at anchor at this delightful island a storm arose which prevented the Admiral's design of extending his researches to the remoter parts of it as it appeared diversified with woods forests lawns gardens and cultivated fields and in every respect well supplied with necessaries for the refreshment of ships bound to the southern lands but the fury of the storm increased so fast that those on shore were glad to recover their ships They were scarce embarked when the billows rose to such a height as to make it dangerous to hazard their security to the anchors with which they were moored they therefore instantly weighed and put to sea and as the wind blew fair they proceeded at a great rate towards the bad sea of Schouten to which they were bound After a run of leagues from  EasterIsland  they got sight of an island in latitude deg min S which they took to be  DogIsland  discovered by Schouten and therefore did not stay to examine it  The tradewind began now to shift and to veer about to the southwest by which the ships in the night were driven among a cluster of islands and the African galley being a head was jammed between the rocks of which a more particular account will be found in the course of the Work  These islands were situated between the th and th degrees of south latitude and Roggewein's  Pernicious Island  is no doubt the same with that where Commodore Byron found the carved head of a rudder that had belonged to a Dutch longboat and where he also found a piece of hammered iron a piece of brass and some small iron tools which the ancestors of the present race of inhabitants had obtained from this ship after her shipwreck  Here the crews of the remaining ships grew troublesome and unruly They had already been out ten months and had experienced nothing but hardships without the least prospect of advantage either to themselves or country A council was therefore called and it was determined to return home by way of the EastIndies On quitting Pernicious Island they fell in with a small island which they called Aurora because it was discovered at break of day and soon after with another small island which they called Vesper because they came in sight of it in the evening About twentyfive leagues to the westward of Pernicious Island they found themselves entangled among a cluster of islands which they called the Labyrinth because it was some time before they could disengage the ships from the rocks and shoals with which they were surrounded Having providentially escaped this imminent danger they continued their course to the westward and after some days sail fell in with an island which by its beautiful appearance promised some refreshment They saw many natives with lances and long pikes passing  and repassing along the shore and they sent two boats well manned to speak with them and to encourage them to trade Their endeavours however were ineffectual till by killing some and dispersing the rest they made good their landing When they had gained the shore the savages seemed more tractable they even assisted them in gathering herbs and bringing them water the women in particular appeared enamoured with them and by many alluring ways endeavoured to gain their confidence but they were to the last degree deceitful Being decoyed into an ambuscade the savages surrounded them on all sides and notwithstanding a brisk fire was kept up which killed many and wounded more not a Dutchman that fell into the snare escaped unwounded After this misfortune it was with reluctance that any one ventured ashore to look for refreshments This island they called Recreation on account of its salutary herbs and it is placed in lat deg S and in long deg The natives were of the middle size but strong and well made lively and of a bold undaunted spirit Their bodies were painted and covered with a kind of net which they wrapt about them decently enough The women were covered from head to foot with a very pretty stuff that felt soft like silk their complexion was dark with shining black hair very white teeth and brilliant eyes and to sailors who had long been at sea they were not a little inviting The third day after they left this island they fell in with several islands at  once to which they gave the name of Bauman's Islands where the inhabitants were altogether as courteous and civil as those they had left had been treacherous and cruel They came and trafficked with great good nature and honesty and were to appearance as fair and beautiful as those in the most celebrated parts of Europe They now thought themselves near the islands which Dampier has named New Britain but it was many days sail before they came in sight of them in which interval the scurvy made dreadful havock The sailors were very desirous of staying in these islands to refresh and to recover their strength but the Commander who had other views pursued his course to the East Indies with all imaginable dispatch  Thus all this grand expedition by which the expectations of the Commander in Chief and his employers had been raised to a very high pitch came to nothing The men were dissatisfied with their officers for going so far and the officers with their Commander for not going farther The existence of a southern continent still remained as doubtful as ever and so it continues at this period June  Since the above was written the Adventure who accompanied Capt Cook in the Resolution on a new voyage is arrived and reports that they had sailed between the th and th degrees of south latitude but had found no land so that if any land lies farther to the southward it must be uninhabitable  portrait of Sir Francis Drake  S  R  FRANCIS DRAKE  SIR FRANCIS DRAKE's VOYAGES PARTICULARLY THAT ROUND THE WORLD In and  BEFORE we proceed to the relation of the particular Voyages that characterize the navigators who first surrounded the globe and who immortalized their names by their skill and their courage it may be expected that we should give some account of their families and first setting out the distinguishing marks of genius that led them to prefer the fatigues and dangers of a seafaring life to learned ease or the calm pursuit of less hazardous employments and that we should trace the steps by which they rose to eminence by their bravery and their conduct  The bare narration of the incidents recorded in a single voyage however memorable would convey but a very imperfect knowledge of the general character of those renowned heroes who carried the glory of their country to the remotest regions of the earth We shall therefore endeavour to follow them as they advance to fame and accompany them from their highest elevation to that period when all distinctions are levelled  The celebrated mariner of whom we are now to give an account was son to Edmund Drake a gentleman of Tavistoke in Devonshire who being inclined to the doctrine of the Protestants at that time much opposed by Q Mary was obliged to quit his place of residence and retire to Medway in Kent where after that Queen's death he was first appointed Chaplain in the royal navy and afterwards Vicar of Upnor In these employments his income being small and his family large he owed the education of several of his children to the kindness of his relations and that in particular of Francis the eldest of twelve to Sir John Hawkins under whom as it appears he very early distinguished himself and laid the foundation both of his fame and his fortune  The learned Camden indeed informs us that he was put apprentice to the master of a small trading vessel in whose service he behaved so well that his master dying a batchelor left him his vessel as a reward for his diligence but Stowe who seems better informed represents him in a superior light tells us that Francis Russel afterwards Duke of Bedford was his godfather and that Sir John Hawkins was his near relation What Camden relates of Francis may however be true of his brother for there were no less than four who were bred to the sea  Be this as it may the first enterprize of  consequence in which we find him engaged was in a voyage to the West Indies as Captain of the Judith under his relation already mentioned Those islands having but lately been discovered and very little frequented by the English were thought so much to abound in wealth that no voyager thither could fail of being recompensed with great advantages Nothing was talked of among the mercantile or adventurous part of mankind but the beauty and riches of the new world Fresh discoveries were frequently made new countries and nations never heard of before were daily described and it may easily be concluded that the relators did not lessen the merit of their discoveries by suppressing or diminishing any circumstance that might produce wonder or excite curiosity  This was the age of enterprize and discovery and her Majesty encouraged the ardour of her subjects by furnishing ships and commissions to such officers of distinction in her royal navy as were willing to engage in hazardous pursuits  The projects however that were formed were not always successfully carried into execution they were frequently defeated by the ignorance of the adventurers but more often by the malice of the Spaniards who from the first discovery of America considered every other nation that attempted to follow them as invaders of their rights and incroachers upon  their  territories At that time however as now it was no uncommon thing for those who went  in search of new discoveries to carry on a kind of contraband trade with the new settlers which tho' prohibited by the Crown of Spain was yet countenanced by the Viceroys and Governors but even these would sometimes take advantage of the power lodged in their hands and make prize of the profits which they themselves had been the means of enhancing under pretence that those profits had been obtained by an illicit trade  Among those who suffered most by the injustice of the Viceroys was Sir John Hawkins who having struck out a new trade highly advantageous to the parties concerned though disgraceful to humanity supplied the Mexican Spaniards with slaves from Africa and received from them in return large remittances in gold and silver This was connived at though we do not find that it was absolutely tolerated by the Spanish court  It was however after one of those successful voyages in which we find two of the Queen's ships engaged namely the Jesus commanded by Hawkins as Admiral and the Minion of which Captain John Hampton was Commander with four other armed trading ships among which was the Judith Captain Drake that being driven by stress of weather into the port of St John d'Ulloa in the bay of Mexico they were there waiting for a supply of provisions when the Spanish fleet from Europe arrived consisting of sail richly laden with European merchandize and on board of which was a new Viceroy  As the port was then absolutely in the power of the English it was debated among the principal officers whether the Spanish fleet should be suffered to enter as Admiral Hawkins suspected that if they were admitted they would contrive some means of distressing him and yet if they were not they must perish at sea an event that would certainly bring on a war which he as a private trader could by no means justify  Upon mature deliberation it was therefore judged safest to propose an agreement with the Viceroy to which he consented and by which it was stipulated that the English should hold one side of the harbour and the Spaniards the other and that hostages should be given on both sides that no injury should be done to either But it was soon discovered that though on the part of the English six gentlemen were sent yet on that of the Spaniards the hostages were only common men finely dressed This gave cause of distrust yet the English naturally honest were not sufficiently on their guard  The Spaniards for some weeks behaved with seeming cordiality mutual civilities passed between the officers of both nations and the English having supplied their wants were preparing to depart when all of a sudden at a signal given the Spaniards assaulted their ships as the officers were at dinner boarded the Minion by a concealed ambuscade which however was repulsed with loss and then a general massacre  ensued The English who were on shore were all put to death three of the four trading ships were presently sunk and the Minion and Jesus were so embarrassed by their moorings that it was almost a whole hour before they could be placed in a posture of defence which however was at last effected They then returned the attack with so much fury that the Spanish ViceAdmiral was soon blown up and in her perished men and not long after the Spanish Admiral himself was sunk The Spaniards in revenge set two of their ships on fire to burn the Minion and Jesus the first of which set sail and escaped but the Jesus after shifting the Admiral with his crew on board the Judith fell a victim with the rest to Spanish treachery  In the night the Judith having made her escape endeavoured but in vain to join the Minion and being only a bark of tons alone on a hostile coast crouded with men and having barely provisions on board for her own slender company a mutiny arose among the mariners and by far the greatest number insisted on being put on shore chusing rather to take their chance among the savages than to remain on board to starve at sea or again to fall into the power of the merciless Spaniards  Accordingly Capt Hawkins gave every man his choice either to land on the continent or sail with him and share his fate About of the stoutest seamen chose the former of whom five only lived to return to England These  gave an account that on their landing the natives mistaking them for Spaniards fell upon them suddenly and killed eight of their number that after they were known to be enemies to the Spaniards they were used with kindness that however being tired of living among savages they agreed to part and to seek the means of returning home Some directed their course to the northward and these watching the opportunity seized a small vessel and crossing the Gulph traversed an immense tract of land till they arrived at a French settlement on the northern continent Others travelled westward and of these which were by far the greatest part sixtyfive fell into the hands of the Spaniards and suffered various torments from the Inquisition three were burnt alive and two only survived to reach their own country Of those who followed the northern course five found means after enduring incredible hardships to get to Nova Scotia of whom three were brought safe to England in French merchants ships  It was in the above engagement that Captain Drake first distinguished himself and to his judicious conduct that those who escaped from the Jesus owed their preservation The Judith had the good fortune to arrive safe in England having purchased some provisions on the Island of Cuba but what became of the Minion we have not been able to learn  In this expedition Sir John Hawkins lost an immense sum It was in vain to make complaint  to his sovereign of the infraction of the peace The Spanish minister vindicated the injustice of the Viceroy and the Queen tho' she secretly resented the loss of her ships could not openly abett the illicit trade carried on by her servants  Drake who shared in the misfortune of his relation possessed both his spirit and his industry He did not sit down to lament the loss he had sustained but having acquired some degree of credit by his gallant behaviour and some knowledge of the weakness and wealth of his plunderers he determined to profit by his losses and to make reprisals whenever a fair opportunity should offer  It was no difficult matter to engage new adventurers in new projects in those early days of Mexican commerce and Drake was not long before he raised a fund to begin trade on a new footing In he made his first expedition chiefly on his own account with two ships the Dragon and the Swan and the next year in the Swan alone in both which voyages he enlarged his experience but it does not appear that he repaired his loss  In he found means however to fit out a much greater force in order to carry into execution an enterprise which he had meditated not only to reinstate his fortune but to revenge the treachery of his enemies  About this time war was agitating between England and Spain to which it must be confessed the illicit trade carried on to the Spanish settlements not a little contributed He therefore set sail from Plymouth in the Pascha a  letter of marque ship of tons accompanied by the Swan of tons the command of which he entrusted to his brother John in both which ships he had embarked choice men with a year's provisions and such warlike stores and ammunition as he judged necessary for the enterprize he had in view He had likewise the precaution to take with him the frames of two or three small pinnaces that if any accident should befal either of his larger ships he might have it in his power to preserve the crew without being driven to the necessity of leaving any of them behind a precaution which experience had taught him in the unfortunate expedition of his kinsman Sir John But this was not the only use for which he foresaw these small vessels would be wanted as will appear in the sequel  With this warlike force inconsiderable as it may now appear he cleared the land of England on the th of May and the weather continuing fair and the wind favourable on the th of June he passed between Dominica and Guadaloupe and on the th of July came in sight of the high land of Santa Martha then continuing his course to the southward on the th of the same month both ships arrived at Port Pheasant which lay at a convenient distance from Nombre de Dios the place of their destination  Here he proposed to build his pinnaces and was going ashore with a few men unarmed  when discovering a smoke at a distance he made the signal for another boat to follow him w  th an armed force Being joined by this reinforcement he matched towards the fire where he found a plate of lead nailed to a tree with an ins  ription engraven upon it by one Garret an Englishman who had left that place a day or two before and had taken that method of informing him that the Spaniards had been advertized of his intended visit and of his rendezvous at that port and that therefore it would be prudent for him to make but a very short stay  Drake surprized no doubt at the news but at the same time knowing how convenient this place was for his designs and considering that the hazard and waste of time which could not be avoided in seeking another station was equivalent to any other danger which was to be apprehended from the Spaniards determined to follow his first resolution only for his greater security he ordered a kind of fort to be made by felling a number of large trees and laying the trunks and branches one across another on an elevated spot that commanded the river which in case of an attack might enable him to repel any ordinary force which the Spaniards were likely to order out against him This done he set the carpenters to work and while they were employed in putting the frames of the pinnaces together one Captain Rause happened to touch at the same port with a bark of men To Rause Drake imparted his design and  sollicited his concurrence to which he consented and when the pinnaces were ready both set sail together shaping their course to Nombre de Dios They touch'd at the Island of Pines where they were informed by the negroes they found there that the inhabitants of that place were in daily expectation of some soldiers which the Governor of Panama had promised to send to defend them from the Symerons or fugitive negroes who having escaped from the tyranny of their masters had settled themselves under two kings or leaders on each side the neck of land which parted Nombre de Dios from Panama and not only asserted their natural right to liberty and independance but endeavoured to revenge the cruelties they had suffered and had lately put the inhabitants of Nombre de Dios into the utmost consternation These negroes the Captain  on shore on the main land so that they might by joining the Symerons recover their liberty or if they preferred slavery to independance they might not have it in their power to apprize the people of Nombre de Dios of his intention to invade them as by their distance and their want of every means of communication it must be long before they could convey them intelligence Then selecting men from his own company and from the crew of his new associate Captain Rause he embarked with them in his new pinnaces and set sail for Nombre de Dios  On July the th at night he approached the town undiscovered and dropt his anchors  under the shore intending after his men were refreshed to begin the attack but finding that they were terrifying each other with formidable accounts of the strength of the place and the multitude of the inhabitants he determined to hinder the panic from spreading by leading them immediately to action and therefore ordering them to their oars he landed without any opposition there being only one gunner upon the key though it was fortified by six brass cannon of the largest size But the gunner while they were employed in throwing the cannon from their carriages alarmed the town as they soon discovered by the bells the drums and the noise of the people  Drake leaving twelve men to guard the pinnaces marched into the town with little or no opposition The forces that the alarm had hastily drawn together were soon dispersed except a few whom he detained as prisoners in order to shew him the Governor's house and also the storehouse where the mules that bring the silver from Panama were usually unloaded  Being now in full possession of the town he posted the main of his small body under the command of his brother in the marketplace and then followed the guides with the rest to the storehouse where forcing the door and entering the room where the silver was deposited they found it heaped up in bars in such quantities as almost exceed belief the pile being as they conjectured seventy feet in length ten  in breadth and twelve in height each bar weighing between thirty and fortyfive pounds It is easy to imagine that at the sight of this treasure nothing was thought of by the English sailors but by what means it might best be conveyed to their boats and doubtless it was not easy for Drake who considering their distance from the shore and the number of their enemies was afraid of being intercepted in their retreat to hinder his men from encumbering themselves with so much silver as might have retarded their march and obstructed the use of their weapons however by promising to lead them to the King's treasury where there were gold and jewels to a far greater value and where the plunder was not only more portable but nearer the shore he persuaded them to follow him not however without every man his bar and rejoin the main body in the marketplace Here he found his little troop much discouraged by the apprehension that if they stayed any longer the enemy might gain possession of their pinnaces and that they should then without any means of retreat be left to stand alone against the whole force of that country Drake not indeed easily terrified but sufficiently cautious sent to the harbour to examine the ground of their fears and to learn if the same panic had taken possession of the men whom he had left to guard his boats but finding no foundation for these dreadful apprehensions he persisted in his first design and led the troop forward  to the royal treasury In their way there fell a violent shower of rain which wet some of their bowstrings and extinguished many of their matches springlocks for muskets not being then invented a misfortune which might soon have been repaired and which perhaps the enemy might suffer in common with them but which however on this occasion very much embarrassed them as the delay produced by it repressed that ardour which sometimes is only to be kept up by continued action  It was in vain for Drake to expostulate or to represent the disgrace of returning in rags after having the chief treasure of the world within their power he therefore reproached their cowardice set before their eyes the imminent danger to which they would inevitably be exposed if they failed to behave like men anxious for glory and zealous for the honour of their country Animated by these incentives they resumed their former spirit and pushing briskly forward the whole company followed till they arrived at the treasury which they instantly forced Having thus far succeeded Drake committed the care of the riches to his brother and Oxenham of Plymouth  This man made himself remarkable by one of the boldest undertakings that ever was devised▪ As soon as he arrived in England with the pr  zemoney acquired in this expedition he purchased a bark of  tons and manned it with brave seamen with these he sailed to the Isthmus of Darien and laying his bark up in a creek marched cross the neck of land which separates the North Sea from the great Pacific Ocean where he arrived with his companions without being discovered and having there seized a ship for their purpose they ranged the coast and made themselves masters of an immense treasure but falling out among themselves they separated and thus weakened they became an easy prey to the Spaniards who recovered their treasure and Oxenham being taken with those that continued with him and having no commission to produce both he and his companions were executed as pirates When they parted they had in their possession two ships laden with gold to the amount of half a million sterling  a man known  afterwards for his bold adventures in the same parts while he with the main body should again return and reconnoitre the marketplace and disperse any parties of the Spaniards that might be forming into a body to oppose their progress With this view as he was advancing his strength suddenly failed him and he fell down speechless  Then it was that his companions perceived a wound in his leg that he received in entering the town but had hitherto concealed lest his men easily discouraged should make their concern for his life a pretence for returning to their boats Such however had been his loss of blood as was discovered upon nearer observation that it had filled the prints of his footsteps and it appeared scarce credible that after such an effusion life should remain The bravest were now willing to retire neither desire of honour or of riches was thought to prevail in any man over the regard for his life  that of Drake being already given over for lost  But Drake whom cordials had restored to his senses was the only man who could not be prevailed on to leave the enterprize unfinished It was to no purpose that they advised him to go on board to have his wound dressed He well knew how impracticable it was to regain the opportunity when it was once lost and could easily foresee that a respite of but a few hours would enable the Spaniards to recover from their consternation to assemble their forces refit their batteries and remove their treasure What he had undergone so much danger to obtain was now in his hands and the thoughts of leaving it untouched was too mortifying to be patiently borne however as there was little time for consultation and the same danger attended their stay in that perplexity and confusion as their return they bound up his wound with his scarf and partly by force partly by intreaty they carried him back to the boats in which with what treasure they were able to bring off they all embarked by break of day Then taking with them out of the harbour a sloop laden with wines they went to the Bastimento's an island about a league from the town where they staid two days to recover the wounded men who had been hurt in the first rencounter and to regale themseves with the wines they had taken and with the fruits that grew in great plenty in the gardens of that island  During their stay here there came over to that island a Spanish gentleman sent by the Governor with instructions to inquire whether the Captain was that Drake who had before been on their coast whether the arrows with which many of their men were wounded were not poisoned and whether they wanted provisions or other necessaries The messenger likewise extolled their courage with the highest encomiums and expressed his admiration of their daring undertaking Drake though he knew the civilities of an enemy are always to be suspected and that the messenger amidst all his professions of regard was no other than a spy yet knowing that he had nothing to apprehend treated him with the highest honours that his condition admitted of In answer to his inquiries he assured him that he was the same Drake with whose character they were before acquainted that he was a rigid observer of the laws of war and that he never permitted the arrows discharged by his followers to be poisoned He dismissed him with considerable presents and told him that though he had in part failed in this attempt he would never desist from his design of revenging the treachery of the Viceroy of Mexico till he had shared with Spain the treasures of America  He then resolved to return to the Isle of Pines where they had left their ships and to consult about the measures they were now to take and having arrived on the st of August  at their former station they dismissed Captain Rause who judging it unsafe to stay any longer on the coast desired to be no farther engaged in their designs But Drake not to be diverted from his purpose after being cured of his wound inquired of a negroe whom he took on board at Nombre de Dios the most wealthy settlements and weakest parts of the coast This man recommended Carthagena as the most wealthy and being the most powerful the least upon its guard The Admiral seemed to approve the man's notion and setting sail without loss of time came to anchor Aug between Charecha since called Boca Chica and St Barnard's two islands at a little distance from the harbour of Carthagena Then passing with his boats round the island he entered the harbour and in the mouth of it found a frigate with only an old man in it who voluntarily informed him that about an hour before a pinnace had passed by with sails and oars and all the appearance of expedition and importance that as she passed the crew on board her bid him take care of himself and that as soon as she touched the shore he heard the noise of cannon fired as a warning and saw the shipping of the port drawn up under the guns of the castle The Captain who had himself heard the discharge of the artillery was soon convinced that he was discovered and that therefore nothing could be attempted there with any probability of success He therefore  contented himself with taking a ship of Seville of tons which the relator of this voyage mentions as a very large ship and two small frigates in which he found letters of advice from Nombre de Dios intended to alarm that part of the coast  Drake now finding his pinnaces of great use and not having a sufficient number of sailors for all his vessels was desirous of destroying the Swan the ship commanded by his brother that the others might be better manned This necessary as it was could not easily be effected without disgusting the officers on board her who losing their commissions would naturally be averse to her destruction  Drake knew that nothing but the love of their leaders could animate his followers to encounter such hardships as he was about to expose them to and therefore rather chose to bring his designs to pass by artifice than by authority He sent for the carpenter of the Swan took him into his cabin and having first engaged him to secrecy ordered him in the middle of the night to go down into the well and bore five holes through the bottom laying something against them that might hinder the bubbling of the water from being heard To this the carpenter after some expostulation consented and the next night performed his promise In the morning August the th Drake going out with his pinnace afishing rowed up to the Swan and having invited his  brother to partake of his diversion inquired with a negligent air why the Swan was so deep in the water Upon which his brother being alarmed sent down his steward to learn the cause who returned immediately with an account that the ship was leaky and in danger of sinking in a very little time They had instantly recourse to the pump but having laboured for five hours and gained very little upon the water they willingly according to Drake's advice set the vessel on fire and went on board the Pascha  Finding it now necessary to lie concealed for some time till the Spaniards should forget their danger and remit their vigilance they set sail for the sound of Darien and without approaching the coast that their course might not be observed they arrived there in six days  This being a convenient place for their reception both on account of privacy it being out of the road of all trade and as it was well supplied with wood water wildfowl hogs deer and all kind of provisions he stayed here fifteen days to careen his vessels and refresh his men who worked interchangeably on one day the one half and on the next day the other half  On the th of September Drake left his brother with the ship at Darien and set out with two small vessels towards the Rio Grand which they reached in three days and on the th of the same month were discovered by a Spaniard from the land who believing them to be his countrymen made a signal for them to come on shore with which they very readily  complied but he soon finding his mistake abandoned his plantation where they found great plenty of provisions with which having laden their vessels they departed  In the mean time his brother Captain John Drake went according to the directions that had been left him in search of the Symerons or fugitive negroes from whose assistance they now entertained hopes of completing the success of their voyage and touching upon the main land by means of the negroes whom they had taken from Nombre de Dios engaged two of the Symerons to come on board his ship leaving two of his own men as hostages for their safe return Those men having assured him of the affection of their nation appointed an interview between Drake and their leaders With this appointment Drake being made acquainted he immediately quitted Port Plenty so named by the English from the great store of provisions they had amassed at that place and came by the direction of the Symerons into a secret bay among beautiful islands covered with trees which concealed their ships from observation and where the channel was so narrow and rocky that it was impossible to enter it by night so that there was no danger of a sudden surprize Here they met and entered into engagements which common enemies and common dangers preserved from violation But the first conversation informed the English that their expectations were not immediately to  be gratified for upon their enquiries after the most probable means of acquiring gold and silver the Symerons told them that had they known sooner the chief end of their expedition they could easily have gratified them but that during the rainy season which was now begun they could not recover the treasure they had taken from the Spaniards out of the rivers in which they had concealed it Drake therefore proposing to wait in this place till the rains were passed built with the assistance of the Symerons a fort of earth and timber and leaving his brother and part of his company to guard it set out with three pinnaces towards Rio de la Hacha being of a spirit too active to he still patiently even in a state of plenty and security and with the most probable expectations of immense riches  In their way thither they anchored within sight of Carthagena without landing and on the th of October took a Spanish bark with which they entered the harbour in disguise but were soon accosted by a Spanish gentleman whom they had some time before taken and set at liberty who coming to them in a boat as he pretended without the knowledge of the Governor made them great promises of friendship and professions of esteem But Drake having waited till next morning without receiving the great things he had been encouraged to expect found that all this pretended kindness was no more than a stratagem to amuse  him while the Governor was raising forces for his destruction  This appeared more clearly on the th when two frigates well armed and manned came out in the night with a view to surprize the pinnaces and make prisoner of Drake but these being discovered and their design frustrated Drake when daylight approached leapt intrepidly ashore single in defiance of their troops which hovered at a distance in the woods and on the hills without ever venturing to advance within reach of the shot from the pinnaces To leap however upon an enemy's coast in sight of a superior force only to shew how little they were feared was an act that in these times would meet with little applause but motives of policy might influence the conduct of Drake and make that necessary then which now appears a ridiculous bravado Finding the whole country advertised of his attempts and in arms to oppose him he might make a feint only of landing to increase their fears and encourage their alarms that they might keep together till he should assault them in their deserted posts a stratagem which there is reason to think he put in practice as he continued upon the coast till one of his vessels had only a gammon of bacon and a small quantity of bread on board for seventeen men and till there was on board his own vessel even a greater scarcity But resolution and success reciprocally produce each other They had not sailed  more than three leagues on their return to their ships before they fell in with and attacked a coasting vessel which after some resistance they took and happily found it laden with excellent provisions He now determined to return to the Symerons with whom as has been said he left his brother and part of his force In conjunction with them he had meditated an attempt to make his way over the Isthmus and invade the Spaniards in the inland parts where they probably never dreamt of an enemy  When they arrived at Port Diego so named from the negroe who had procured them their intercourse with the Symerons they found Captain John Drake and one of his company dead being killed in an attempt almost unarmed to board a frigate of which they had received intelligence well provided with all things necessary for its defence The Captain was unwilling to make the attack and represented to his company the madness of their proposal but being overborne by their clamours and importunities to avoid the imputation of cowardice complied to his destruction  But this was not the only misfortune that befel this little company for soon after many of them fell ill of the calenture a malignant fever very frequent in the hot climates which carried off among several others Joseph Drake another brother of the Commander  While Drake was employed in the recovery of the sick the Symerons who ranged the country for intelligence brought him an account that  the Spanish fleet was arrived at Nombre de Dios the truth of which was confirmed by a pinnace which he sent out to make observations This therefore was the time for their journey when the treasures of the Peruvian mines were to be transported from Panama over land to Nombre de Dios He therefore communicated his design to the Symerons requested their advice and assistance and having obtained the promise of both by their direction he procured all things necessary for their subsistance and on the third of February in the following year set out from Port Diego Having already lost twentyeight of his company and being under the necessity of leaving some to guard his ship he took with him only English and Symerons who not only served as guards to shew the way but as carriers to convey the provisions  They carried with them besides arrows for war and arrows for hunting and fowling the heads of which are proportioned in size to the game they pursue For oxen stags or wild boars they have arrows or javelins with heads weighing a pound and a half which they discharge near hand and which scarcely ever fail of being mortal Their second sort are about half as heavy as the other and are generally shot from their bows these are intended for smaller beasts With the third sort of which the heads are an ounce in weight they kill birds As this nation is in a state which does not set them above continual cares for the immediate  necessaries of life he that can temper iron best is among them most esteemed and perhaps it would be happy for every nation if honours and applauses were as justly distributed and he were most distinguished whose talents were most useful to society  Every day by sunrising they began to march and having travelled till ten rested near some river till twelve then travelling again till four they reposed all night in huts or wigwams which the Symerons had either left standing in their former marches or very readily erected for them by setting up three or four posts in the ground and laying poles from one to another in the form of a roof which they covered with palmetto boughs and plantain leaves In the vallies where they were sheltered from the winds they left three or four feet next the ground open but on the hills where they were more exposed to the chill blasts of the night they thatched them close to the ground leaving only a door for entrance and a vent atop in the middle for the smoke of the fire to escape  In their march they met not only with plenty of fruits upon the banks of the rivers but with wild swine in abundance of which the Symerons without difficulty killed for the most part as many as were wanted One day however they found only an otter and were about to dress it at which Drake expressing his wonder was asked by Pedro the chief Symeron  "Are you a man of war and in want and yet doubt whether  this be meat that hath blood in it"  For which Drake in private rebuked him says the relator whether justly or not it is not very important to determine only it shews the genius of the times when superstition prevailed and when the greatest men were not wholly exempt from its influences  On the third day of their march and the th of February they came to a town of the Symerons situated on the side of a hill and encompassed with a ditch and a mud wall to secure it from any sudden surprize Here the inhabitants lived with great neatness and in plenty and with some observation of religion paying great reverence to the cross a practice which the relator says Drake prevailed upon them to change for the use of the Lord's Prayer which we cannot help remarking is very unlikely in so short a stay Indeed it is added that here they strongly importuned Drake to prolong his abode promising to double his force but he either thinking greater numbers unnecessary or fearing that if any difference should arise between them and his own men he should be overborne by numbers he prudently declined both their invitation and their offer of additional assistance and that in such terms as expressed his eagerness to engage and his confidence of success from the bravery of his followers  The Symerons continued to conduct him on his journey and led him through rural shades and lofty woods which sheltered his people so effectually from the sun that their march was  less toilsome than if they had travelled in England during the heat of summer Four of the Symerons that were acquainted with the way went about a mile before the main body and cut off branches as marks to direct them for there was no beaten track then followed twelve Symerons after whom came the English with the two leaders and the other Symerons closed the rear In this order on the th of Feruary they arrived at the top of a very high hill on the summit of which grew a tree of a wonderful height and magnitude in which they had cut steps for the more easy ascent to the top where there was a kind of alcove to which they invited Drake and from thence shewed him not only the North Sea from whence they came but the great Pacific Ocean on which no English vessel had ever yet sailed This prospect exciting his natural curiosity and ardour for adventures and discoveries he lifted up his hands to God and implored his blessing upon the resolution which he that instant formed of sailing in an English ship on that immense sea  From this stupendous mountain they descended after having feasted their eyes with the grandest prospect the earth can furnish and in two days came into an open level country where their march was incommoded with the grass which is of a peculiar kind consisting of a stalk like that of a bullrush and a blade on which the oxen and other cattle feed till it grows too high for them to reach then it is that the natives set the whole on fire and it is  no uncommon thing to behold vallies of immense extent in a blaze at once from whence the cattle fly in the utmost terror and many perish by the sudden conflagration It might be supposed that this burning of the soil would in a hot climate check the powers of vegetation and that it would be years before the earth could recover its fertility but it is just the contrary the ashes or the reeds are hardly extinguished before a new verdu  e begins to appear and before a month is elapsed the whole valley beheld at a distance looks as green as ever so astonishingly wonderful are the powers of Nature on this happy soil  When they had arrived within a convenient distance of the road from Panama they posted themselves in a grove or wood near which the treasure was to be conveyed from thence to Nombre de Dios They then dispatched a trusty Symeron in the habit of a slave properly instructed to learn on what day the mules on whose backs the treasure is carried were to set out The man was so well qualified for the service and so industrious in the prosecution of it that he soon returned with an account that the treasurer of Lima intending to embark for Europe would pass the night following with eight mules laden with gold and one with jewels that it was their custom to travel by night and to rest in the day to avoid the heat and that Venta Cruz was to be their first stage  On this intelligence they changed their to it and immediately directed their march  towards Venta Cruz sending for security two Symerons habited as before to examine the way who as they passed along perceived by the scent of a match that some Spaniard was before them and creeping silently forward surprized a soldier asleep upon the ground They bound him without offering any other violence and brought him to Drake who upon enquiry found that their spy had not deceived them in his intelligence The soldier having informed himself of the Captain's name conceived such a dread of the vengeance he had threatened that after having made an ample discovery of the treasure that was now at hand cautioned them likewise against being deceived by the recoes or carriers from Nombre de Dios who met the others by the way and who were hourly expected with merchandize and provisions but without any gold He closed his examination with an humble petition to Drake to consider his situation as liable to punishment by his countrymen for his treachery and to immediate death by the enemy if he had refused to make full confession of the secrets with which he was entrusted He therefore requested to be taken into his protection and that when the expected treasure should fall into his hands he would be graciously pleased to allow him as much of it as would maintain himself and his children during the remainder of their lives since there would abundantly more arrive than he and his company could carry away Drake agreed to his request upon condition that he led him to a place of secrecy where  he could conceal his men till the time of action and where there was no danger of the mules passing by without being perceived This the man did and Drake placed his ambush accordingly  Before the time expected the whole company were properly refreshed and instructed Oxenham was appointed to head the Symerons assisted by Pedro their leader and Drake was to command the English The parties were then divided the English took the right of the way in front and the Symerons the left at a small distance in the rear In this manner they were posted that one company might be in readiness to seize the hindmost mule at the same time that the other had seized the foremost for the mules it seems being tied together travel in a line and are all guided by leading the first  Every thing being now as well concerted as human prudence could foresee and the critical moment of action being soon expected they lay down and covered themselves in the grass at about eighty or ninety paces distance from the road that the noise of their breathing might not be heard by the guard that convoy'd the treasure  They had not been more than an hour in this situation when the bells of the mules on the left coming from Venta Cruz began to be heard but previous orders having been given to meddle only with those from Panama those from Venta Cruz were suffered to pass unmolested Unfortunately however it happened that one Robert Pike being heated with liquor prevailed upon the man that was next him to  creep forward with him in order to be in readiness to signalize themselves by being the first to seize the mules from Panama At that instant an officer who accompanied the recoes from Venta Cruz perceiving something white moving in the grass for Drake had ordered all h  s company to put their shirts over their clothes to distinguish them in the night took the alarm and from a walk was observed to push his horse forward on a smart trot and before he had passed the hindmost ambuscade he was heard to ride along in a full gallop but neither Drake who commanded the English nor Ox  n  m who headed the Symerons being apprized of the reason had any thought of taking measures to intercept his journey  It was not however long before the recoes from Panama came up and were eagerly seized by the English in front and secured by the Symerons as had been agreed upon in the rear but to their great mortification they found two of them only loaded with silver and the rest with provisions six of those from Panama which carried the valuable burdens of gold and jewels being ordered back and the like number that came from Venta Cruz sent forward in their room The drivers were brought immediately to the Captain and examined who informed him that a horseman riding in haste had met them and had talked with the treasurer and advised him to send back his gold and jewels and suffer those only to proceed that were now in his Drake's power that he might  by that cheap experiment discover whether there were not as he had reason to suspect some ambush in the way or whether his apprehensions might not betray him into visionary fears for which there was no real ground  That Drake was not less enraged than his followers at this disappointment cannot be doubted but there was now no time to be spent in complaints The whole country he knew would soon be alarmed and all the force of the Spaniards assembled to overwhelm him he had no fortress to retire to every man was his enemy and every road better known to the Spaniards than to himself This was an occasion that demanded all the qualities of an hero an intrepidity never to be shaken and a judgment never to be perplexed He immediately considered all the circumstances of his present situation and found that it afforded him only the choice of marching back by the same way through which he came or forcing his passage through Venta Cruz He foresaw many difficulties in marching back besides the hazard of having his ships seized before his return he therefore determined to pass forwards to Venta Cruz before the enemy could be prepared to oppose him He asked Pedro the leader of the Symerons whether he would dare to follow him and having received from him the strongest assurance that nothing should separate them he commanded his men to set forwards When they came to the gates of the town they dismissed  the mules they had made use of to carry their prize and continued their march with as little noise as possible yet they discovered that notwithstanding the utmost precaution had been used the alarm had been spread and the forces of the town hastily drawn together to oppose their entrance Drake who was not unacquainted with the behaviour of that kind of town militia received their first onset and then breaking in upon them drove them before him without farther opposition and was seconded by the Symerons who could not be restrained from making plunder of the town but Drake hastened in person to the Spanish ladies and assured them that no injuries should be offered to them nor was there the least indecency permitted and the forces of the Spaniards being dispersed he continued his march to the ships without any apprehension of danger yet with great speed being very solicitous about the state of the crew so that he allowed his men harrassed as they were but little time for sleep or refreshment By kind exhortations gentle authority and a chearful participation of all their hardships he prevailed upon them to bear without murmur not only the toil of travelling but on some days the pain of hunger In this march he owed much of his expedition to the assistance of the Symerons who being accustomed to the climate and naturally robust when any of the English fainted by the way two of them would carry him between them for  miles together Nor was their valour less than their humanity after they had learned from their English companions to despise the firearms of the Spaniards  When they were within five leagues of the ships they found a town built in their absence by the Symerons at which Drake consented to halt sending a Symeron to the ships with his gold toothpick as a token which though the master knew it was not sufficient to gain the messenger credit till upon examination he found that the Captain having ordered him to regard no message without his handwriting had engraven his name upon it with the point of his knife the master then sent the pinnace up the river to meet the Captain and afterwards sent to the town for those whose weariness had made them unable to march farther  On February the d the whole company was reunited and Drake whose good or ill success never prevailed over his shew of piety celebrated their meeting with thanks to God  Drake not yet discouraged soon turned his thoughts to new projects and without languishing in melancholy reflections upon past miscarriages employed himself in forming schemes for repairing them Eager of action and acquainted with man's nature he never suffered idleness to infect his followers with cowardice but kept them from sinking under any disappointment by directing their attention to some new enterprize  Upon consultation with his own men and the Symerons he found them divided in their opinions some declaring that before they engaged in any new attempt it was necessary to increase their stores of provisions and others urging that the ships in which the Spanish treasure was embarked should be immediately attempted The Symerons proposed a third plan and advised them to undertake another journey overland to the house of one Pezaro near Veragua whose slaves brought him every day more than pounds sterling from the mines which he heaped together in a strong stone house that might by the help of the English be easily forced But Drake being unwilling to fatigue his followers with another journey overland determined to steer a middle course between these variable opinions and manning his two pinnaces the Bear and the Minion he sent John Oxenham in the Bear towards Tolu to seek provisions and went himself in the Minion to the Cabezes to endeavour to intercept the treasure that was to be transported from Veragua and that coast to the fleet at Nombre de Dios first dismissing with presents those Symerons who desired to return to their wives and ordering those that chose to remain with him to be kindly entertained Drake took at the Cabezes a frigate of Veragua the pilot of which informed him that there was in the harbour of Veragua a ship freighted with more than a million of gold to which he offered  to conduct him being well acquainted with the soundings if he might be allowed his share of the prize so much was his avarice superior to his honesty  Drake after some deliberation complying with the pilot's conditions sailed towards the harbour but had no sooner entered the mouth of it than he heard the report of artillery which was answered by others at a greater distance upon which the pilot told them that they were discovered this being the signal appointed by the Governor to alarm the coast  Drake now thought it convenient to return to the ships that he might enquire the success of the other pinnance which he found with a frigate that she had taken with twentyeight fat hogs hens and a great store of maize or Indian corn The vessel itself was so strong and wellbuilt that he fitted it for war determining to make a second attempt on Nombre de Dios  On March the st he set sail with the new frigate and the Bear towards the Cabezes at which he arrived in little more than two days and found there one Totu a Frenchman with a ship of war Having supplied Totu with water and other articles of which he was in want he desired to join the Admiral in his new attempt to which Drake consented and admitted him to accompany him with of his men stipulating to allow them a proportionable share of whatever booty they should acquire yet Drake was not without some suspicions of danger from this  new ally he having eighty men and the English reduced to thirtyone Manning however the pinnaces they set sail for Rio Francisco at which place they arrived on the th of March Here they landed and having dismissed their pinnaces for fear of discovery and ordered them to repair to the same place on the fourth day following they began their march through the woods towards Nombre de Dios and continued it with such silence and regularity as surprized the French who did not imagine the Symerons so discreet and obedient to command as they appeared to be and were therefore in perpetual anxiety about the fidelity of their guides nor did the Symerons treat the Frenchmen with that submission and regard which they paid to the English whose bravery and conduct they had already tried At length after a laborious march of more than seven leagues they began to hear the hammers of the carpenters in the bay it being the custom in that hot season to work in the night and to rest in the day and in a short time they perceived the approach of the recoes or droves of mules from Panama They now no longer doubted that their labour would be rewarded and every man imagined himself secure from poverty for the remaining part of his life they therefore when the mules came up rushed out and seized them with an alacrity proportioned to their expectations The three droves consisted of one hundred and nine mules each of which carried  pounds weight of silver It was to little purpose that the soldiers ordered to convoy the treasure attempted resistance After a short combat in which the French Captain and one of the Symerons were wounded it appeared with how much greater ardour men are animated by interest than fidelity  As it was possible for them to carry away but a small part of this treasure after having wearied themselves with hiding it in the thickets they determined to return by the same way they came and without being pursued they traversed the woods where the French Captain being disabled by his wound was obliged to stay two of his company continuing with him When they had gone forward about two leagues the Frenchmen missed another of their company who upon enquiry was known to be intoxicated with wine and supposed to have lost himself in the woods by neglecting to observe the guides but common prudence not allowing them to hazard the whole company by too much solicitude for a single life they travelled on towards Rio Francisco at which they arrived on the d of April and looking out for their pinnaces were surprised with the sight of seven Spanish sloops and immediately concluded that some intelligence of their motions had been carried to Nombre de Dios and that these vessels had been fitted out to pursue them which might undoubtedly have overpowered the pinnaces and their feeble crews  Nor did their suspicions stop here but immediately it occurred to them that their men might be compelled by torture to discover where their frigate and ship were stationed which being weakly manned and without the presence of the chief Commander would fall into their hands almost without resistance and all possibility of escaping be entirely cut off These reflections sunk the whole company into despair and every one instead of endeavouring to break through the difficulties that surrounded him resigned himself up to his ill fortune when Drake whose intrepidity was never to be shaken represented to them that though the Spaniards should have made themselves masters of the pinnaces they might yet be hindered from discovering the ships He put them in mind that the pinnaces could not be taken the men examined their examinations compared their resolutions formed their vessels sent out and the ships taken in an instant Some time must necessarily be spent before the last blow could be struck and if that time were not neglectfully lost it might be possible for some of them to reach the ships before the enemy and direct them to change their station  They were animated with this discourse by which they observed that their leader was not without hope but when they came to look more narrowly into their situation they were unable to conceive upon what it was founded To pass by land was impossible as the way lay  off to Sea on a R  in Quest of his  over high mountains thick woods and deep rivers they had not a single boat in their power so that passage by water seemed equally impracticable But Drake determined upon the only means of success which their condition afforded them and ordering his men to make a raft out of the trees that were then floating in the river offered himself to put out to sea upon it and chearfully asked who would accompany him John Owen John Smith and two Frenchmen who were willing to share his fortune embarked with him on the raft which was fitted out with a sail made of the biscuit sacks in which they had carried their provisions and formed a kind of oar to direct its course instead of a rudder Then having comforted the rest with assurances of his regard for them and resolution to leave nothing unattempted for their deliverance he put off and after having with much difficulty failed three leagues descried two pinnaces hasting towards him which upon a nearer approach he discovered to be his own and hailing them proposed that they should anchor behind a point that jutted out into the sea while he put to shore and crossing the land on foot was received by his company with that satisfaction which is only known to those who have been acquainted with dangers and distresses  The same night they rowed silently to Rio Francisco where they embarked the whole company with what treasure they had been  able to bring with them through the woods then sailing back with the utmost expedition they returned to their frigate and soon after to their ship where Drake divided the gold and silver equitably between the French and English  Here they spent fourteen days in fitting out their frigate more completely during which time the Frenchmen with their ship lay among the Cabezes while twelve English and sixteen Symerons travelled once more into the country as well to recover the French Captain whom they had left wounded as to bring away the treasure which they had hid in the woods Drake whom his company would not suffer to hazard his person in another land expedition went with them to Rio Francisco where he found one of the Frenchmen who had staid to attend their Captain and was informed by him upon his enquiries after his fortune that half an hour after their separation the Spaniards came upon them and easily seized upon the wounded Captain but that his companion might have escaped with him had he not preferred money to life for seeing him throw down a box of jewels that retarded him he could not forbear taking it up and with that and the gold which he had already was so loaded that he could not escape With regard to the bars of gold and silver which they had concealed in the ground he informed them that men had been employed in searching for them The people however either mistrusting the informer's veracity or  confident that what they had hidden could not be found pursued their journey but upon their arrival at the place found the ground turned up for two miles round and were able to recover no more than bars of silver and small quantity of gold They discovered afterwards that the Frenchman who was left drunk in the woods falling into the hands of the Spaniards was tortured by them till he confessed where Drake and his company had concealed their plunder so fatal to Drake's expedition was the drunkenness of his followers  Then dismissing the French they passed by Carthagena with their colours flying and soon after took a frigate laden with provisions and honey which they valued as a great restorative and then sailed away to the Cabezes Here they staid about a week to careen their vessels and fit them for a long voyage determining to set sail for England and that the faithful Symerons might not go away unrewarded broke up their pinnaces and gave them the iron the most valuable present in the world to a nation whose only employments were war and hunting and amongst whom show and luxury had no place Pedro their Captain being desired by Drake to go through the ships and to chuse what he most desired fixed his eye upon a scymetar set with jewels which the French Captain had presented to Drake for the provisions with which he had supplied him and being unwilling to ask for so valuable a present  offered for it four large quoits or thick plates of gold which he had formerly concealed in the waters but Drake desirous to shew him that fidelity seldom is without a recompence gave it him with the highest professions of satisfaction and esteem Pedro receiving it with the utmost gratitude informed him that by bestowing it he had conferred greatness and honour upon him for by presenting it to his King he doubted not of obtaining the highest rank among the Symerons He then persisted in his resolution of giving him the gold which was ostentateously thrown by Drake into the common stock pretending that those at whose expences he had been sent out ought to share in all the gain of the expedition Thus was Drake's character consistent with itself he was equally vain and avaricious and by this specious shew of honesty his view was to engage his followers to do the like yet whatever lengths he might go to save appearances he had scarce cunning enough to disguise the artifice  They now forsook the coast of America which for many months they had kept in perpetual alarms having taken more than vessels of all sizes between Carthagena and Nombre de Dios of which however they never destroyed any unless they were fitted out against them nor ever detained the prisoners longer than was necessary for their own security or concealment a behaviour which humanity dictates and which even policy cannot disapprove He must certainly  meet with obstinate opposition who makes it equally dangerous to yield as to resist and who leaves his enemies no hopes but from victory  What riches they acquired is not particularly related but it is not to be doubted that the plunder of so many vessels together with the silver seized at Nombre de Dios must have amounted to a very great sum though the share that was allotted to Drake was not sufficient to lull him into effeminacy or to repress his natural inclination to adventures They arrived at Plymouth on the th of August on Sunday in the afternoon and so much were the people elated with the news of their arrival that they left the preacher and ran in crouds to the key with shouts and congratulations  Drake having in the voyage just mentioned had a view of the South Sea as has already been related and formed a resolution to sail upon it did not suffer himself to be diverted from his design by the prospect of any difficulties that might obstruct the attempt nor any danger that might attend the execution His reputation was sufficiently established to remove all obstacles for obstacles he met with and to obviate the motives that produced them but it was not till the year that he was able to assemble a force proportioned to his design and to obtain a commission from the Queen  This commission which was always questioned is now upon the strongest presumptive evidence denied as will be seen in the sequel  by  which he was constituted CaptainGeneral of a squadron consisting of five vessels of which the Pelican of tons was commanded by himself as Admiral the Elizabeth of tons ViceAdmiral commanded by John Winter the Marygold of tons by John Thomas the Swan of tons by John Chester and the Christopher of tons by Thomas Moon the honest carpenter who on the former voyage destroyed the Swan by Drake's direction  These ships equipped partly by himself and partly by other private adventurers he manned with stout sailors and furnished with such provisions as he thought necessary for so long and hazardous a voyage nor did he confine his concern to the ordinary equipment of his ships with naval stores and military preparations but carried with him whatever he thought might contribute to raise in those nations with which he should have intercourse the highest ideas of the arts and grandeur of his native country He therefore not only procured a complete service of silverplate for his own table and furnished the cookroom with many vessels of the same metal but engaged several musicians to accompany him rightly judging that nothing would more excite the admiration of savages or uncivilized people than the powers of music On this occasion however it must not be concealed that he engaged his men on the false pretence of sailing to Alexandria and  that it was not till after he arrived on the coast of Brazil that he acquainted them with his design of passing the Straits and entering the South Seas  On the th of Nov about three in the afternoon he sailed from Plymouth but a heavy storm such as no man on board had ever seen the like taking him almost as soon as out of port forced him into Falmouth where he staid till the th of December to refit He then took his departure and on the th of the same month fell in with the coast of Barbary and on the th cast anchor at the island of Mogadore about one mile distant from the main between which and the isle they found a very convenient harbour Here he began to build the pinnaces the frames of which he brought ready from Plymouth to be put together as in his former voyage While the carpenters were employed in this service they were discovered by the Moors that inhabit those coasts who sent two of their Chiefs on board Drake's ship receiving at the same time two of his company as hostages These men he not only treated in the most hospitable manner but presented them with such things as they appeared most to admire it being with him an established maxim to endeavour to secure in every country a kind reception to such Englishmen as should come after him by treating the inhabitants with a shew of kindness and generosity  But this friendly intercourse was in appearance soon broken for on the next day observing the Moors making signals from the land they sent out their boat as before to fetch them to the ship and one John Frye leapt ashore intending to become an hostage as on the former day when immediately he was seized by the Moors and the crew observing great numbers start from behind a rock with weapons in their hands thought it next to madness to attempt his rescue and therefore provided for their own security by returning to the ship Frye was mounted on horseback and immediately carried up into the country to their King who being then in continual expectation of an invasion from Portugal suspected that these ships were sent only to reconnoitre the coast and discover a proper harbour for a more formidable fleet but being informed who they were and whither they were bound not only dismissed the captive but made large offers of friendship and assistance which Drake however did not stay to receive but being disgusted at this breach of the laws of commerce and apprehending further treachery he quitted the coast on December and on the th of January arrived at Cape Blanco having in their passage taken several Spanish vessels and found one in the harbour with no men  Here while Drake was employing his men in catching fish and training them for land as well as sea service the natives came down to  the sea side with ambergrease and other gums to traffic for such commodities as they then stood most in need of and with which Drake very copiously supplied them  Having rifled and discharged the Spanish ships which they had taken they sailed on the d of January towards the isles of Cape Verd and on the th came to anchor before Mayo hoping to furnish themselves with fresh water but having landed they found the chief town deserted and marching farther up the country saw the vallies extremely fruitful and abounding with ripe figs cocoes and plantains but could by no means prevail upon the inhabitants to converse or traffic with them However they were suffered by them to range the country without molestation but found no water except at such a distance from the sea that the labour of carrying it to their ships was greater than it was at that time necessary for them to undergo Salt had they wanted it might have been obtained with less trouble being left by the sea upon the sands and hardened by the sun during the ebb in such quantities that the chief traffic of this island is carried on by means of it Thus though the island abounded with goats poultry and delicious fruits of various kinds they could procure none of any consequence because the Portuguese who were then in possession of it were prohibited all commerce with strangers on very severe penalties  On the st of January they made St Iago an island at that time divided between the natives and the Portuguese who first entering these islands under the shew of traffic by degrees established themselves claimed a superiority over the natives and harrassed them with such cruelty that they obliged them either to fly to the woods and mountains where many of them perished with hunger or to take arms against their oppressors and under the insuperable disadvantages with which they contended to die almost without a battle Such treatment had the natives of St Iago received which had driven them into the rocky parts of the island from whence they made incursions into the plantations of the Portuguese sometimes with loss but generally with that success which desperation produces so that the Portuguese were in continual alarms and lived with the natural consequences of guilt terror and anxiety They were wealthy but not happy and possessed the island but did not enjoy it  In passing this island the garrison of the fort discharged three pieces of cannon at them but without effect For this insult they took a Portuguese ship laden with wines the pilot of which they retained but set the rest of the crew on shore This man Nuno da Silva by name was very useful to them in traversing the coast of Brazil being acquainted with the bays and harbours where fresh water and provisions were to be obtained Him they continued to detain  captive though they broke up his ship before they entered the Straits till they were about to leave the coasts of Peru when finding him no longer serviceable they set him on shore in the Spanish settlements from whence he afterwards returned home and wrote an account of the voyage as far as he went which is thought by many to be very authentic  It was soon after the capture of this ship that a difference arose between Drake and his friend Mr Thomas Doughty which gradually increasing grew into inveteracy and terminated at last in the death of the latter Doughty was a gentleman and a scholar whom Drake had persuaded to embark in this expedition to better his fortune and to whom till the incident happened which we are about to relate he had shewn particular marks of favour and friendship but trivial beginnings are often productive of the most important events  The ground of the malevolence with which Drake pursued Doughty under the colour of justice has hitherto lain concealed from the public eye but we shall now trace it step by step till the fatal period when the unhappy victim was brought to the block and when Drake by suffering revenge to triumph over virtue left an indelible blot upon his character which no panegyric can wipe away  Among the Harleian manuscripts there is a written account of this voyage in which the author has particularly had his eye on this transaction  As he was an eyewitness of all that passed his relation will best appear in his own words  "Captain Drake says he having boarded the ship of Nuno da Sylva and feasted his eyes with the view of the commodities he committed the custody and wellordering of this prize unto Master Thomas Doughty as his good and esteemed friend praying him in any case to see good order kept and whoso should be the breaker thereof to give him to understand of any such without exception of any  "It thus chanced that General Drake had a brother not the wisest man in Christendom whom he put into this said prize as also divers others This Thomas Drake as one more greedy of prey than covetous of honesty or credit offered himself the first and only man to break the General his brother's commandment for he contrary to his strict prohibition did not only break open a chest but did dive suddenly into the same that Master Doughty knew not how to discharge himself against the General but by revealing it unto him yet first Master Doughty called Thomas Drake unto him and shewed him his great folly in this behalf who yielding unto his fault prayed Master Doughty to be good unto him and keep it from the General but he briefly told him he could not keep it but he would deliver it with what favour he might So at the General's next coming on  board the prize Master Doughty opened the same unto him who presently falling into a rage not without some great oaths seemed to wonder what Thomas Doughty should mean to touch his brother and did as it were assure himself that he had some farther meaning in this and that he meant to strike at his credit and he would not or could not by God's life as he phrased it suffer it From this time forth grudges did seem to grow between them from day to day to the no small admiration of the rest of the company although some envying his former favour and friendship with the General and some I think doubting that his capacity would reach too far to the aggrandizing his credit in the country talked variously of the matter however Master Doughty was put again into the Pelican Thus grudges although they had not long rested yet were they grown to great extremities such and so great as a man of any judgment would verily think that his love towards him in England was more in brave words than hearty good will or friendly love"  So writes our author  In proceeding on their voyage they came within sight of Fogo an island so called from a mountain about the middle of it continually burning and like the rest inhabited by the Portuguese Two leagues to the south of Fogo lies Brava which has received its name from its fertility abounding with all kinds of fruits  and watered with great numbers of springs and brooks but having neither harbour nor anchorage was at that time uninhabited  Drake having sent out his boats with plummets to sound was not able to find any ground about it and it is reported that many experiments of the like kind have been made without success However he took in water sufficient and on the d of Feb set sail for the coast of Brazil  On February the th he passed the equator after being becalmed near three weeks during which time they had dreadful storms of thunder with lightning but without any memorable accident till continuing their voyage on March one of their vessels with men and the greatest part of the fresh water on board was to their great discouragement separated from them but their perplexity lasted not long for on the next day they discovered her and she again joined her associates In their long course which gave them opportunities of observing several animals both in the air and water at that time very little known nothing entertained or surprized them more than the flyingfish which is nearly of the same size with a herring and has fins of the length of his whole body by the help of which when he is pursued by the benito a large kind of mackarel as soon as he finds himself upon the point of being taken he springs up into the air and flies forward as long as his wings continue wet moisture being as it seems necessary to make them  pliant and moveable and when they become dry and stiff he falls down into the water unless some vessel intercepts him and dips them again for a second flight This unhappy animal is not only pursued by fishes in his natural element but attacked in the air where he hopes for security by the don or spar kite a great bird that preys upon fish and their species must certainly be destroyed were not their increase so great that the young fry in one part of the year covers that part of the sea  There is another fish named the cuttle of which whole shoals will sometimes rise at once out of the water and of which a great multitude fell into their ship  At length having sailed without sight of land for days they arrived April the th on the coast of Brazil  "In the mean while you shall hear says our author what befel Master Drake never leaving to seek and force upon Master Doughty found in the end this opportunity to degrade him Whether of purpose or his own voluntary it chanced John Brown the trumpet to go aboard the Pelican where for that he had been long absent the company offered him a hobbey among the which Master Doughty putting in his hand said Fellow John you shall have in my hand although it be but light amongst the rest and so laying his hand on his buttock which perceived of John Trumpet he began to swear wounds and blood to the company to let him  loose for they are not all said he the General's friends that be here and with that turned him to Master Doughty and said unto him as himself presently after told me in the prize God's wounds Doughty what dost thou mean to use this familiarity with me considering thou art not the General's friend who answered him What fellow John what moves you to this and to use these words to me that am as good and as sure a friend to my good General as any in this place and I defy him that shall say the contrary But is the matter thus why yet fellow John I pray thee let me live until I come into England Thus John Brown coming again presently aboard the prize had not talked any long time with the General but the boat went aboard and rested not but presently brought Master Doughty to the prize's side General Drake sitting in the midst of his men who hearing the boat at the ship's side stood up and Master Doughty offering to take hold of the ship to have entered said the General Stay there Thomas Doughty for I must send you to another place and with that commanded the mariners to row him on board the flyboat saying unto him it was a place more fit for him than that from whence he came but Master Doughty although he craved to speak with the General could not be permitted neither would he hear him"  Soon after this the  flyboat here mentioned called the Swan was separated from them by a violent storm  "in all whose absence says our author the General never ceased to inveigh against Master Doughty terming him a conjurer and a witch and at any time when we had foul weather he would say that Tom Doughty was the occasion thereof and that it came out of Tom Doughty's capcase and would avouch the same with oaths"  After the storm abovementioned they steered near the land to the southward and on the th anchored under a cape which they afterwards called Cape Joy because in two days the vessel that was missing returned to them Here they refreshed their weary crews and took in fresh water but finding the country though pleasant without inhabitants they weighed anchor and by running a little farther to the southward found a small harbour between a rock and the main where the rock breaking the force of the sea the ships rode at anchor with the greatest security On this rock they killed several seals keeping them for food and found them wholesome though not palatable  Their next course was directed to the great river of Plate in deg of south latitude but not finding anchorage in that river they sailed in quest of a more convenient harbour when they were surprized by a sudden storm in which they again lost sight of the flyboat This accident determined Drake to contract the number of his  ships that he might not only avoid the inconvenience of such frequent separations but ease the labour of his men by having more hands in each vessel For this purpose he sailed along the coast and on May the th discovered a bay which though it promised fair he durst not enter before it was examined he therefore ordered his boat to be hoisted out and taking the line into his own hand went on sounding the passage till he was three leagues from his ship when on a sudden the weather changed the skies blackened the wind rose and all the usual forerunners of a storm began to threaten them Nothing was now thought of but the means of returning to the ship but the thickness of the fog intercepting it from their sight made the attempt almost impracticable In this perplexity which Drake was not more sensible of than those whom he had left in the ships nothing was to be omitted however dangerous that might tend to extricate them from it Captain Thomas therefore having the lightest vessel steered boldly into the bay and taking the Admiral on board dropt anchor and lay out of danger while the rest that were in the open sea suffered much from the tempest and the Mary the Portuguese prize was driven before the wind The others as soon as the tempest was over discovering by the fires that were made on shore where Drake was repaired to him  Here they met with no inhabitants though there were several wigwams or huts standing in which they found some dried fowls and among them ostriches of which the thighs were as large as those of a sheep These birds are too unwieldy to rise from the ground but with the help of their wings or rather stumps they run so swiftly that the English could never come near enough to shoot any of them  Not finding this harbour convenient or well stored with wood and water they left it on the th of May and on the th entered another much safer and more commodious which they no sooner arrived at than Drake sent Winter to the southward in search of those ships that were absent and immediately after sailed himself to the northward and happily meeting with the Swan conducted her to the rest of the fleet after which in pursuance of his former resolution he ordered her to be broken up preserving the iron work for a future supply The other vessel which was separated in the late storm could not be discovered While they were thus employed upon an island about a mile from the main land to which at low water there was a passage on foot they were discovered by the natives who appeared upon a hill at a distance dancing and holding up their hands as beckoning to the English to come to them which Drake observing sent out a boat with knives bells and bugles and such things as by their usefulness or novelty he imagined  would be agreeable As soon as the English landed they observed two men running towards them as deputed by the company who came within a little distance and then standing still could not be prevailed upon to come nearer The English therefore tied their presents to a pole which they fixed in the ground and then retiring saw the Indians advance who taking what they found upon the pole left in return such feathers as they wore upon their heads with a small bone about six inches in length carved round the top and burnished Drake observing their inclination to friendship and traffic advanced with some of his company towards the hill upon sight of whom the Indians ranged themselves in a line from east to west and one of them running from one end of the rank to the other backwards and forwards bowed himself towards the rising and setting of the sun holding his hands over his head and frequently stopping in the middle of the rank leaped up towards the moon which then shone directly over their heads thus calling the sun and moon the deities they worship to witness to the sincerity of their professions of peace and friendship While this ceremony was performing Drake and his company ascended the hill to the apparent terror of the Indians whose apprehensions when the English perceived they peaceably retired which gave the natives so much encouragement that they came forward immediately and exchanged their arrows feathers  and bones for such trifles as were offered them Thus they traded for some time but by frequent intercourse finding that no violence was intended they became familiar and mingled with the English without the least distrust They go quite naked except the skin of some animals which they throw over their shoulders when they walk or lie in the open air They roll up their hair which is very long with a plume of ostrich's feathers and usually stick their arrows in it that they may not encumber them they being made with reeds headed with flint and therefore not heavy Their bows are about an ell long Their chief ornament is paint which they use of several kinds delineating generally upon their bodies the figures of the sun and moon in honour of their deities  It is observable that the inhabitants of most nations amongst whom the use of cl  aths is unknown paint their bodies Such was the practice of the inhabitants of our own country To this custom did our earliest enemies the Picts owe their denomination As it is not probable that caprice or fancy should be uniform there must be doubtless some reason for a practice so general and prevailing in distant parts of the world which have no communication with each other The original end of painting their bodies was probably to exclude the cold an end which if we believe some relations is so effectually produced by it that the men thus painted never shiver at the most piercing  blasts but doubtless any people so hardened by continual severities would even without paint be less sensible of the cold than the civilized inhabitants of the same climate However this practice may contribute in some degree to defend them from the injuries of winter and in those climates where little evaporates by the pores may be used with no great inconvenience but in hot countries where perspiration in a greater degree is necessary the natives only use unction to preserve them from the other extreme of weather or more probably from the inconvenience of the flies which were it not for that or some such defence would be intolerable  These savages had no canoes like the other Indians nor any method of crossing the water which was probably the reason why the birds in the adjacent islands were so tame that they might be taken with the hand having never been before frighted or molested The birds here spoken of are without doubt the penguins of which so ample a description is given in the Voyages of Byron and Wallis The great plenty of these fowls and of the seals that were found everywhere on the shores of this coast contributed much to the refreshment of the English who named the bay where they then lay Sealbay from the number they there killed of those animals  These seals seem to be the chief food of the natives for the English often found raw pieces  of their flesh half eaten and left as they supposed after a full meal by the savages whom they never knew to make use of fire or any art in dressing or preparing their victuals Nor were their other customs less wild or uncouth than their way of feeding One of them having received a cap off the General's head and being extremely pleased as well with the honour as the gift to express his gratitude retired to a little distance and thrusting an arrow into his leg let the blood run upon the ground testifying as it is probable that he was ready to shed his blood in his defence  When the Swan flyboat was separated from the fleet in the storm off the coast of Brazil the crew despairing of ever being able to rejoin it began to be in fear for provisions They were on a desart coast had no place of rendezvous and were ignorant even of their place of destination In this untoward situation a dispute arose among the officers of which the author of the manuscript before cited gives the following relationHe had already taken notice that Master Thomas Doughty had been sent on board this vessel as a kind of punishment and in truth so it proved for the master of the vessel who seems also to have been the purser knowing upon what terms he stood with Drake took every occasion to insult or as our author's phrase is to discredit him for those were always ranked among Drake's friends who were enemies to Master Doughty  "This man  foreseeing that provisions might run short put himself from the mess of Master Doughty Captain Chester and the rest of the gentlemen and did set himself amongst the sailors nothing at all sparing but rather augmenting his own diet but how scantily those gentlemen did fare there be some come home that except they will deny their own words can make relation thereof  "Master Doughty with Master Chester whom the General had made Captain of the flyboat found themselves so ill used that Master Doughty accosted his friend one day in these words I marvel Master Chester that you will take it at his hands to be thus used considering that you were here authorized by the General to be our Commander And at the same time he spoke to the Master and told him that he used so much partiality in the distribution of his provisions that the same could not be borne considering the extremity they were like to fall into for want of victuals and that it was against reason that he and his messmates should be so plentifully fed while others were at the point to starve The Master hereat putting himself in a rage swore that such rascals as he was should be glad to eat the shoals husks when he would have them Master Doughty answered him again that reason would will that he should be used as well as other men considering his advantages Thou any advantage here replied the Master  I would not give a point for thee nor thy advantages and if ever thou comest home to enjoy any advantages I will be trussed up Then in multiplying words and as I heard a blow or two passing between them the Master in the spleen of his heart looking at him with an evil eye Thou will thou have victuals thou shalt be glad if we do not meet with the General the rather to eat that falls from my tail on the anchorfluke ere thou gettest home again Then Master Doughty turning to Master Chester said unto him Master Chester let us not be thus used at this knave's hands Lose nothing of that authority that the General committed unto you If you will we will put the sword into your hands again and you shall have the government This case I will aver to be true for there were two or three witnesses sworn to these articles as some of the special matter that he had to lose his head for"  It was not many days after this quarrel before the Swan fell in again with the fleet when Drake as has been said caused her to be hauled on shore set on fire and burnt or as others say broke up and converted into firewood for the use of the fleet  Mr Doughty being here delivered from the flyboat was again restored to the Pelican where the master with whom he had the dispute appears to have preferred a complaint against him and with such aggravations as he thought proper  to add all which were favourably heard and credit given to the whole relation by the General who wanted only a pretence to persevere in his severity to the man who being once his favourite was now become the object of his aversion  Doughty provoked no doubt by the misrepresentations of the master and the partiality with which they were heard gave the General some opprobrious language adding  "that the lightest word that came out of his Doughty's mouth was to be believed as soon as the General's oath Whereupon the General did not only strike him but commanded him to be bound to the mast for the accomplishment of which the master of the flyboat took no little pains This happened as the two ships the Pelican and the Canter lay together and as soon as Doughty was released he was put into the Canter although greatly against his will for that he said he knew them to be there that sought his life as namely the master of the flyboat and some other desperate and unhonest people but would he or no thither he must or else the General swore he would lift him out with the tackle and for that purpose commanded the tackle to be loosed Thus aboard the Canter he went and his brother John Doughty with him"  The Canter was a vessel taken from the Spaniards on the coast of Africa  While they lay in this harbour there is one remarkable incident related by this author that deserves particular notice as it tends to illustrate the previous steps that were pursued to accomplish the ruin of this unfortunate gentleman  "On board the fly boat says he was one Thomas Cuttle who some time had been Captain of the Pelican under Drake with whom the General had been tampering This man came out from him in great wrath and offering to go over to the main between the which and the island where they then lay was as has been said but a shallow water He standing well nigh up to the middle in the water with his piece uttered these words Well my Masters quoth he I find I am heavily borne with here because I will not accuse this gentleman meaning Doughty of that as I take God to witness I know not by him and therefore I declare before you all that whatsoever becomes of me I never knew any thing by him but to be the General's friend and rather than I will bide this hard countenance at the General's hands I will yield myself into cannibal's hands and so I pray you all to pray for me"  After this public declaration the man departed and having reached the opposite shore he went up into the country where firing his piece to bring the natives to him Drake taking it for a signal that he wanted to return sent a boat over to the main and brought him back  Just before their departure from this harbour which lay in a bay a little to the southward of Cape Hope  "Captain Drake himself came on board the Elizabeth and calling all the company together told them that he was to send thither a couple of men the which he did not know how to carry along with him this voyage and go thro' therewithal as namely quoth he Thomas Doughty who is a commotioner and a seditious fellow and a very bad and lewd fellow and one that I have made that reckoning of as of my left hand and his brother the young Doughty a witch a poisoner and such a one as the world cannot judge of having his knowledge from the devil and so warning the company that none should speak to them nor use any conference with them if they did he would hold them as his enemies and enemies to the voyage And he willed that great care should be taken that they should neither write nor read and then he declared what wealth the worst boy in the fleet should get by this voyage and how the worst boy should never need to go again to sea but should be able to live in England with a right good gentleman for quoth he you shall see that we will have gold come as plentiful as wood into the ships Having finished his speech he departed and shortly after sent the said Thomas Doughty and his brother aboard the Elizabeth commanding them as they would answer it with  their lives not to set pen to paper nor yet to read but what every man might understand and see And sure adds our author their entertainment there was accordingly for men durst not speak to them although willingly perhaps they would and as their fare was with the simplest in the ship so was their lodging But he Thomas Doughty having agreed with the boatswain of the ship for a cabin which stood God knows in an uncomfortable room yet must he pay for the same in England But what came of this to the poor fellow he was fain for his friendly using him to lose his office and continue in heavy displeasure"  Having staid fifteen days in the harbour during which time they continued their friendly intercourse with the savages on June the d they set sail towards the South Sea and six days afterwards stopt at a little bay to break up the Christopher which from the smallness of its size was found incapable of living in those boisterous seas of which before they entered them they had conceived no adequate idea Then passing on they found it necessary to cast anchor in another bay with a view to recover the Portuguese prize which was separated from them in the storm of the th of April and had not yet rejoined them To return in search of it was sufficiently mortifying to proceed without it was not only to deprive themselves of a considerable part of their force but to expose their  friends and companions who had voluntarily embarked on board her to certain death or certain captivity This consideration prevailed and therefore on the th after prayers to God with which Drake for example's sake never forgot to begin an enterprize he put to sea and the next day near Port Julian discovered their associates whose ship was now grown leaky having suffered much in the first storm by which they were separated and afterwards in the fruitless attempts to regain the fleet Drake therefore being desirous to relieve their fatigues entered Port Julian They no sooner landed than they were accosted by two of the natives of whom Magellan left a very terrible account having described them as a nation of giants and monsters nor did they find his narrative entirely without foundation for the least of those they saw was larger and taller than the largest of their company The two who accosted the English appeared much pleased with their new guests received willingly whatever was given them and very exactly observed every thing that passed seeming more particularly delighted with seeing Oliver the mastergunner shoot an English arrow They shot themselves likewise in emulation but their arrows always fell to the ground far short of his  Soon after this friendly contest came another who observing the familiarity of his countrymen with the strangers appeared much displeased and as the Englishmen perceived endeavoured  to persuade them from such an intercourse What effect his arguments had was soon after apparent for another of Drake's companions being desirous to shew the third Indian a specimen of the English valour and dexterity attempted likewise to shoot an arrow but drawing it with his full force burst the bowstring upon which the Indians who were unacquainted with their other weapons imagining them disarmed followed the company as they were walking negligently down towards their boat and let fly their arrows aiming particularly at Winter who had the bow in his hand He finding himself wounded in the shoulder endeavoured to refit his bow and turning about was pierced with a second arrow in the breast Oliver the gunner immediately presented his piece at the insidious assailants which failing to take fire gave them time to level another flight of arrows by which he was killed nor perhaps had any of them escaped surprized and unprepared as they were had not Drake animated their courage and directed their motions ordering them by perpetually changing their places to elude as much as might be the aim of their enemies and to defend their bodies with their targets and instructing them by his own example to pick up and break the arrows as they fell which they did with so much diligence that the Indians were soon in danger of being disarmed Then Drake himself taking the gun which Oliver had so unsuccessfully attempted  to make use of discharged it at the Indian that first began the fray and had killed the gunner aiming it so happily that the hailshot with which it was loaded tore open his belly and forced him to such terrible outcries that the Indians though their numbers increased and many of them shewed themselves from different parts of an adjoining wood were too much terrified to renew the assault and suffered Drake without molestation to withdraw his wounded friend who being hurt in his lungs languished two days and then dying was interred with his companion with the usual ceremony of a military funeral  They staid here two months after this quarrel without receiving any other injury from the natives in which time they discovered the gibbet on which Magellan had formerly executed some of his mutinous company and where  "Drake according to the writers of the Biographia Britannica did the least commendable action of his life in executing Mr John Doughty a man next in authority to himself in which however he preserved a great appearance of justice"  To clear this matter fully it will be necessary to bring together the substance of what these authors have said on the subject and then to add the plain relation from the manuscript already quoted  'Here it was at Port St Julian say these writers that on a sudden having carried the  principal persons engaged in the service to a desart island lying in the bay he called a kind of council of war or rather courtmartial where he exposed his commission by which the Queen granted him the power of life and death which was delivered him with this remarkable expression from her own mouth  We do account that he Drake who strikes at thee does strike at us  He then laid open with great eloquence for though his education was but indifferent he had a wonderful power of speech the cause of this assembly He proceeded next to charge Mr John Doughty  who had been second in command during the whole voyage  when Drake was present and first in his absence with plotting the destruction of the undertaking and the murder of his person He said he had the first notice of this gentleman's bad intentions before he left England but that he was in hopes his behaviour towards him would have extinguished such disposition if there had been any truth in the information He then appealed for his behaviour to the whole assembly and to the gentleman accused He next exposed his practices from the time that he left England while he lived towards him with all the kindness and cordiality of a brother which charge he supported by producing papers under his own hand to which Mr Doughty added a full and free confession After this the Captain or as in the language of those times he is called the General quitted the place telling the  assembly he expected that they should pass a verdict upon him for he would be no judge in his own cause Camden as the reader will see says that he tried him by a jury but other accounts affirm that the whole forty persons of which the court was composed had judged him to death and gave this in writing under their hands and seals leaving the time and manner of it to the General Mr Doughty himself said that he desired rather to die by the hands or justice than to be his own executioner Upon this Captain Drake having maturely weighed the whole matter presented three points to Mr Doughty's choice first to be executed upon the island where they were next to be set on shore on the main land or lastly to be sent home to abide the justice of his country He desired he might have till the next day to consider of these which was allowed him and then giving his reasons for rejecting the two last he declared that he made the first his choice and having received the sacrament with the General from the hands of Mr Francis Fletcher Chaplain to the fleet and made a full confession his head was cut off with an axe by the ProvostMarshal July the d  'As to the imputation which this matter brought upon Drake we will first cite what Camden says of this transaction  "On the th of April entering into the mouth of the river of Plate he saw an infinite number of  seacalves from thence sailing into the haven of St Julian he found a gibbet set up as it was thought by Magellan for the punishment of certain mutineers In this very place John Doughty an industrious and stout man and the next unto Drake was called to his trial for raising a mutiny in the fleet found guilty by twelve men after the English manner and condemned to death which he suffered undauntedly being beheaded having first received the holy communion with Drake And indeed the most impartial persons in the fleet were of opinion that he had acted seditiously and that Drake cut him off as an emulator of his glory and one that regarded not so much who he himself excelled in commendation for sea matters as who he thought might equal him yet wanted there not some who pretending to understand things better than others gave out that Drake had in charge from Leicester to take off Doughty upon any pretence whatever because he had reported that the Earl of Essex was made away by the cunning practices of that Earl"  'We find this matter add the writers just cited touched in several other books and particularly in two which were written on purpose to expose the Earl of Leicester and perhaps deserving the less credit for that reason  'It may be offered in defence of Sir Francis Drake that this man was openly put to death after as fair a trial as the circumstances of time  and place would permit that he submitted patiently to his sentence and received the sacrament with Drake whom he embraced immediately before his execution Besides these there are two points that deserve particular consideration first that in such expeditions strict discipline and legal severity are often absolutely necessary secondly that as to the Earl of Essex for whose death Doughty had expressed concern he was Drake's first patron and it is therefore very improbable he should destroy a man for endeavouring to detect his murderer We may add to all this if liberty may be indulged to conjectures that this man presuming upon the Earl of Leicester's favour who very probably imposed him upon Drake to be rid of him was from thence encouraged to form designs against Drake and this might also be the reason which hindered him from inclining to an absolute pardon as doubting whether it was possible to trust one who had so far abused his confidence already and whose known interest with so great a man might always enable him to find instruments in case he was wicked enough to enter upon fresh intrigues'  We shall just remark upon what is above quoted that the authors do not seem to have been well informed for they have all along imputed to John Doughty what related to his brother Thomas and if credit may be given to the author of the manuscript John Cook by  name this unfortunate Thomas fell a sacrifice to Drake's resentment  "On this island in Port St Julian says he passed many matters which I think God would not have to be concealed especially for that they tended to murder for he Drake spewed out against Thomas Doughty his venom Here he ended all his conceived hatred not by courtesy and friendly reconcilement but by most tyrannical bloodspilling for he was never quiet while he lived who in wisdom and honest government as far surpassed him as he in tyranny surpassed all men The world never committed a fact like unto this for here he murdered him that if he had well looked unto himself had been a more sure and stedfast friend unto him than ever was Pythias to his friend Damon as I think the sequel of this case will shew  "The last day of June the General himself being set in place of judgment and having the whole company brought on shore and having Captain John Thomas set close by him who opened a bundle of papers that were rolled up together wherein was written divers and sundry articles the which before they were read the General spoke unto the purport of them and turning himself to Thomas Doughty who was there present being before brought thither more like a thief than a gentleman of honest conversation he began his charge thus Thomas Doughty you have here sought by divers means in as much as  you may to discredit me to the great hinderance and overthrow of this voyage besides other great matters with which I have to charge you the which if you can clear yourself of you and I shall be very good friends whereof if you cannot you have deserved death Master Doughty answered It should never be approved that he had merited ill by undertaking any villainy towards him By whom quoth the General will you be tried Why good General said he let me live to come unto my country and I will there be tried by her Majesty's laws Nay Thomas Doughty said he I will here impannel a jury on you to enquire into those matters that I have to charge you withal Why General replied Doughty I hope you will see your commission be good I'll warrant you answered the General my Commission is good enough I pray you then let us see it said Master Doughty it is necessary that it should be here shewn Well quoth he you shall  not  see it Then addressing himself to the company You see my Masters how this fellow is full of prating bind me his arms for I will be safe of my life My Masters you that be my good friends Thomas Good Gregory you there my friends bind him so they took and bound his arms behind him Then he uttered divers furious words unto Thomas Doughty as charging him to be the man that poisoned my Lord of  Essex whereas Master Doughty avouched it to his face that he was the man that brought the General first to the presence of my Lord in England Thou bring ME quoth the General to my Lord See my Masters see here how he goeth about to discredit me This fellow with my Lord was never of any estimation I think he never came about him as a gentleman for I that was daily with my Lord never saw him there above once and that was long after my entertainment with my Lord  "Then in fine was there a jury called whereof Master John Winter was foreman Then by John Thomas were the articles read unto them  even once over for a last farewel  for fear that men should have carried them away by memory all which appeared to consist of words of unkindness and to proceed of some choler when the prisoner was provoked all which Doughty did not greatly deny until at length came in one Edward Bright whose honesty of life I have nothing to do with who said Nay Thomas Doughty we have other matter for you yet that will a little nearer touch you It will i'faith bite you to the girskin I pray thee Ned Bright said the prisoner charge me with nothing but truth and spare me not Then John Thomas read further for his last article to conclude the whole withal That Thomas Doughty should say to Edward Bright in Master  Drake's garden that the Queen's Majesty and Council would be corrupted So Bright holding up his finger said How like ye this gare sirrah Why Ned Bright said Master Doughty what should induce thee thus to belye me thou knowest that such familiarity was never between thee and me but it may be that I have said if we brought home gold we should be the better welcome but yet this is more than I do remember Then it came out on farther evidence that Master Doughty should say that my Lord Treasurer had a plot of the present voyage No that he hath not quoth General Drake The other replied that he had and had it of him See my Masters said Drake what this fellow hath done God will have his treachery all known for her Majesty gave me special commandment that of all men my Lord Treasurer should not know it but you see his own mouth hath betrayed him so this was a special article against him to hurt his throat and greatly he seemed to rejoice at this advantage  "Then Master Doughty offered him if he would permit him to live and to answer these objections in England he would set his hand to whatso was there written or to any thing else that he would set down Well once let these men quoth the General first find whether you are guilty in this or no and then we will talk further of the matter  And then he delivered after they had all taken their oaths given by John Thomas the bills of indictment as I may term them unto Mr John Winter who was foreman of this inquest Then Master Leonard Vicary a very assured friend of Master Thomas Doughty's said unto him General this is not law nor agreeable to justice that you offer I have not to do with you crafty lawyers neither do I care for the law but I know what I will do Why quoth Master Vicary who was one of his jury I know not how we may answer his life Well Master Vicary quoth he you shall not have to do with his life let me alone with that you are but to find whether he be guilty in these articles that here are objected against him or no Why very well said Master Vicary then there is I trust no matter of death No no Master Vicary quoth he so with this the jury went together finding all to be true without any doubt or stop made but only to that article that Edward Bright had objected against him for it was doubted of some whether Bright were sufficient with his only word to cast away the life of a man And truly it did argue small honesty in a man to conceal such a matter if it had been spoken in England and to utter it in this place where will was law and reason put in exile for an honest subject would not have concealed such matter which made some doubt of an honest  dealing But to be brief answer was made that Bright was a very honest man and so the verdict being given in it was told to the General that there was doubt made of Bright's honesty Why quoth Master Drake I dare to swear that what Ned Bright has said is very true yet within a fortnight after the same Bright was in such disliking with him as he seemed to doubt his life and having displaced him of the Pelican and put him into the Marygold he gave for reason that himself would be safe and he would put him far enough from him Thus having received in the verdict he rose off the place and departed towards the waterside where calling all the company with him except Master Thomas Doughty and his brother he there opened a certain bundle of letters and bills and looking on them said God's will I have left in my cabin that I should especially have had as if he had there forgotten his Commission but whether he forgot his Commission or no he much forgot himself to sit as Judge without shewing that he had any but truly I think he shewed to the uttermost what he had for here he shewed forth first letters that were written as he said by Master Hankins to my Lord of Essex for his entertainment secondly he shewed letters of thanks from my Lord of Essex unto Master Hankins for preferring so good a servitor unto him and how much  he had pleasured him then read the letters that past from my Lord of Essex unto Secretary Walsingham in his great commendation then shewed he letters of Master Hatton's unto himself tending for the acceptance of his men John Thomas and John Brewer for their well usage in this voyage and lastly he read a bill of her Majesty's adventure of a thousand crowns but I most marvelled that so many noblemen and gentlemen did leave their letters in his hands except it were to shew in this place for his credit So when he had all done he said Now my Masters you may see whether this fellow hath sought my discredit or no and what should hereby be meant but the very overthrow of the voyage as first by taking away of my good name and altogether discrediting me and then my life which I being bereaved of what then will you do You will fain one to drink another's blood and so to return again unto your own country you will never be able to find the way thither And now my Masters consider what a great voyage we are like to make the like was never made out of England for by the same the worst in this fleet shall become a gentleman and if this voyage go not forward which I cannot see how possibly it should if this man live what a reproach it will be not only unto our country but especially unto us the very simplest here may consider of Therefore  my Masters they that think this man worthy to die let them with me hold up their hands and they that think him not worthy to die hold down their hands at the which divers that envied his former felicity held up their hands some others again for fear of his favouritry sticked not to lift their hands although against their hearts but some again lifted up their hands and very hearts unto the Lord to deliver us of this tyrannous and cruel tyrant who upon the same coming to his former judgmentseat pronouned him the child of death and persuaded him withal that he would by this means make him the servant of God and said farther if any man could between this and next meeting devise any way that might save his life he would hear it and wished himself to devise some way for his own safeguard Well General quoth he seeing it is come to this pass  that I see you would have me made away  I pray you carry me with you to Peru and there set me ashore No truly Master Doughty I cannot answer it to her Majesty if I should so do but how say you Thomas Doughty if any man will warrant me to be safe from your hands and will undertake to keep you sure you shall see what I will say unto you Master Doughty then calling on Master Winter said unto him Master Winter will you be so good as to undertake this for me Then Master Winter said unto Master Drake that he should be safe of  his person and he would warrant him if he did commit him to his custody Then Drake a little pausing said See then my Masters we must thus do we must nail him close under the hatches and return home again without making any voyage and if you will do so then speak your minds Then a company of desperate bankrupts that could not live in their own country without the spoil of that as others had got by the sweat of their brows cried God forbid good General which voice was no less attentively heard for there needed no spur to a willing horse Thus telling Master Doughty to prepare for his death and having given him one whole day's respite to set all things in order he rose and departed promising that his continual prayers to God should not cease that it would please God to put it into his head how he might do him good but he had so often before sworn that he would hang him that I think at this present he meant to do him little good Thus Master Doughty continuing all this night the next day and the second night in his prayers except some small time that he used in setting his wordly business in some way and distributing to such as he thought good such things as he then had with him was the d day of July commanded to prepare himself and to make ready to die Then master Doughty with a more chearful countenance then ever he had in all his life to the show as one that  did altogether contemn life prayed him that ere he died he might receive the sacrament which was not only granted but Drake himself offered to accompany him to the Lord's Table for the which Master Doughty gave him hearty thanks never worse terming him than my good Captain Master Drake offered him withal to make choice of his own death and for that he said he was a gentleman be should but lose his head the which kind of death was most agreeable to his mind in as much as he must needs die And truly I heard say that Master Drake offered him if he would that he should be shotten to death with a piece and that he himself would do that exploit and so he should die by the hands of a gentleman But in fine they together received the Lord's Supper the which I do ever assure myself that he did take with as uncorrupted a mind as ever did any innocent of the world for he sure shewed himself to have all his affiance and only trust in God he shewed himself so valiant in this extremity as the world might wonder at it he seemed to have conquered death itself and it was not seen that on all this day before his death that ever he altered one jot of his countenance but kept it as staid and firm as if he had some message to deliver to some nobleman They having thus received the sacrament there was a banquet made such as the place might yield and there they dined  together in which time the place of execution being made ready after dinner as one not willing any longer to delay the time he told the General that he was ready as soon as pleased him but prayed him that he might speak alone with him a few words with the which they talked apart the space of half a quarter of an hour and then with bills and staves he was brought to the place of execution where he shewed himself no less valiant than all the time before for first here kneeling on his knees he first prayed for the Queen's Majesty of England his Sovereign lady and mistress he then prayed to God for the happy succcess of this voyage and prayed to God to turn it to the profit of his country he remembered also therein divers his good friends and especially Sir William Winter praying Master John Winter to commend him to that good Knight all which he did with so chearful a countenance as if he had gone to some great prepared banquet the which I sure think that he was fully resolved that God had provided for him so at the last turning to the General he prayed him that he might make water ere he died for quoth he the flesh is frail and withal turned him about and did so and coming again said Now truly I may say as said Sir Thomas More that he that cuts off my head shall have little honesty my neck is so short So turning him and looking about  on the whole company he desired them all to forgive him and especially some that he did perceive to have displeasure borne them for his sake whereof Thomas Cuttle was one Hugh Smith was another and divers others whereupon Smith prayed him to say before the General then whether ever they had any conference together that might redound to his the General's prejudice or detriment He declared it at his death that neither he nor any man else ever practised any treachery towards the General with him neither did he himself ever think any villainous thought against him Then he prayed the General to be good unto the same Hugh Smith and to forgive him for his sake So the General said Well Smith for Master Doughty's sake and at his request I forgive thee but become an honest man hereafter So then Master Doughty embracing the General naming him his good Captain bid him farewel and so bidding the whole company farewel he laid his head to the block the which being stricken off Drake most despitefully made the head to be taken up and shewed to the whole company himself saying See this is the end of traitors So he being buried and those things finished the whole company being together Master Drake protested before God that whosoever he was who should offend but the eighth part that Thomas Doughty had done should die  The beheading of Cap  n  Doughty by Drake  for it He also protested and swore by the life of God and the blessed sacrament which he that day had received that whosoever he were within the fleet that did give another a blow should lose his hand without exception of any and yet the next day it fortuned that Master Doughty's younger brother walking both silently and mournfully as well for remembrance of his brother's late death as also weighing the imminent peril over his own head as what has been already said and the present consequence may purport there comes unto him this Edward Bright the chief instrument of his Brother's death saying unto him God's wounds thou villain what knowest thou by my wife and withal struck at him with his ruler as of purpose to pick a quarrel to hasten his end also Why Ned Bright quoth he thou seest in what case I am I pray thee let me alone and withal bore off the blow with his arm wherewith the ruler broke but Bright seeming very furious thrust him in the face with the piece that remained in his hand the splinters whereof entered an inch into his face presently upon the which he went unto the General to complain of Bright Why John Doughty quoth he without having any regard of his oath the day before made Ned Bright will be open to your revenge in England for I dare say thy brother did belye her when he said that she had an ill name in  Cambridge Then might every man perceive the littlemeant honesty"  From this plain narrative of the trial and execution of Doughty of the genuineness of which there cannot be the least doubt as the concomitant little circumstances all concur to confirm the author both an eye and ear witness of what he has related there is reason to believe that the success of the voyage covered the iniquity of the undertaker and that the immense booty which Drake brought to England enabled him to stifle the complaints of individuals and by a proper address to convert the acts of oppression murder and pyracy of which he was guilty into so many deeds of necessary duty in order to the accomplishment of the main object the acquisition of wealth at the expence of honesty  That Drake never had a Commission from the Queen as his friends would suggest appears not only from his not producing it at the trial of Doughty which can hardly be justified in contempt to the prisoner but from his not producing it upon another occasion when as shall be shewn immediately he vauntingly produced other credentials of far less moment in order to justify his conduct and give him credit with his company The story then of the remarkable words foisted into the mouth of his Sovereign and recited by his biographer is as false as inconsistent with the character of that wise Princess who though there is reason from her afterconduct  to conclude that she was privy to the voyage yet never openly countenanced it till after it was compleated and the issue of it determined as appears from the account of the conversation which Drake himself gave to his followers a few days before he left Port St Julian to seek a passage into the South Seas  "On the th of August says our Author he commanded his whole company to be ashore and placing himself in a tent one side of which was open and calling Master Winter on one side of him and John Thomas on the other side his man laid before him a great paper book and withal Master Fletcher offered himself to make a sermon Nay soft Master Fletcher said he I must preach this day myself although I have small skill in preaching Well all ye the company here are ye or not Answer was made that they were all here Then commanded he every ships company severally to stand together which was also done Then said he My Masters I am a very bad orator for my bringing up hath not been in learning but what so I shall here speak let every man take good notice of and let him write it down for I will speak nothing but what I will answer it in England yea and before her Majesty as I have it here already set down but whether it were in his book or not that I know not but this was the effect of it and very near the words Thus it is my Masters that we're  very far from our country and friends we are compassed in on every side with our enemies wherefore we are not to make small reckoning of a man for we cannot have a man if we would give for him ten thousand pounds wherefore we must have these mutinies and discontents that are grown amongst us redressed for by the life of God it doth even take my wits from me to think on it Here is such controversy between the sailors and the gentlemen and such stomaching between the gentlemen and sailors that it doth even make me mad to hear it But my Masters I must have it cease for I must have the gentlemen to haul and draw with the mariners and the mariners with the gentlemen and let us shew ou  selves to be all of a company and let us not give occasion to the enemy to rejoice at our decay and overthrow I would know him that would refuse to set his hand to a rope but I trust there is not any such here and as gentlemen are very necessary for government sake on the voyage so have I shipt them for that purpose and to some further intent and yet though I know sailors to be the most envious people of the world and so unruly without government yet may not I be without them Also if there be any here willing to return home let me understand of them and here is the Marygold a ship that I can very well spare I will furnish her to such as will return with the most  credit that I can give them either by my letters or any way else but let them take care that they go homeward for if I find them in my way I will surely sink them therefore you shall have time to consider hereof until tomorrow for by my troth I must needs be plain with you  I have taken that in hand that I know not in the world how to go through withal  it passeth my capacity it hath even bereaved me of my wits to think on it Well yet the voice was that none would return they would all take such part as he did Well then my Masters quoth he Came ye all forth with your own good wills or no They answered All willingly At whose hands my Masters take ye to receive your wages At yours answered the company Then said he how say you will you take wages or stand to my courtesy To your courtesy good Captain was the reply Then he commanded the steward to the Elizabeth to bring him the key of the stores the which he did then turning him unto Master Winter he said Master Winter I do here discharge you of your Captainship and so in brief he said to all the Officers Then Master Winter and John Thomas asked him what should move him to displace them He asked in return whether they could give any reason why he should not do so So willing them to content themselves he willed silence in those matters saying Ye see here the great disorders  we are entangled into and altho' some have already received condign punishment as by death who I take God to witness as you all know was to me as my other hand yet you see over and besides the rest his own mouth did bewray his treacherous dealings and see how trusting to the singularity of his own wit he overreacht himself at unawares But see what God would have to be done for her Majesty commanded that of all men my Lord Treasurer should have no knowledge of this voyage and to see that his own mouth hath declared that he had given him a plot thereof But truly my Masters and as I am a gentleman there shall no more die I will lay my hand on no more although there be here who have deserved as much as he and so charging one Worrall that was present that his case was worse than Doughty's who in Master Doughty's extremities was one of Drake's chief confellows who humbling himself to Drake even upon his knees prayed him to be good unto him Well well Worrall said he you and I shall talk well enough of this matter hereafter Then he charged one John Audley with some ill dealings towards him but opened no matter but said he would talk with him alone after dinner Here is some again my Masters not knowing how else to discredit me say and affirm that I was set forth on this voyage by Master  Hatton some by Sir William Winter and some by Master Hankins but these are a company of idle heads that have nothing else to talk of And my Masters I must tell you I do know them as my very good friends but to say that they were the fitters forth of this voyage or that it was by their means I tell you it was nothing so But indeed thus it was My Lord of Essex wrote in my commendation unto Secretary Walsingham more than I was worthy but by like I had deserved somewhat at his hands and he thought me in his letters a fit man to serve against the Spaniards for my practice and experience that I had in that trade whereupon indeed Secretary Walsingham did come to consult with his Lordship and declared unto him that for that her Majesty had received divers injuries of the King of Spain for the which she desired to have some revenge and withal he shewed me a plot willing me to set my hand and to write down where I thought he might most be annoyed but I told him some part of my mind but refused to set my hand to any thing affirming that her Majesty was mortal and that if it should please God to take her Majesty away it might so be that some person might reign that might be in league with the king of Spain and then will mine own Hand be a witness against myself Then was I very shortly after and on an evening sent for unto her Majesty by Secretary Walsingham and the next day coming  to her Majesty these or the like words she said Drake so it is that I would gladly be revenged on the King of Spain for divers injuries that I have received and said further that he was the only man that might do this exploit and withal craved his advice therein who told her Majesty of the small good that was to be done in Spain but the only way was to annoy him by his Indies Then with many more words he shewed forth a bill of her Majesty's adventure of crowns which however he said at some time before that her Majesty did give him towards his charges He shewed also a bill of Master Hatton's adventure and divers letters of credit that had passed in his behalf but he never let them come out of his own hands He said also that her Majesty did swear by her crown  That if any within her realm did give the King of Spain hereof to understand as she suspected but two they should lose their heads therefore  And now Masters said he let us consider what we have done  We have now set together by the ears three mighty Princes namely her Majesty the Kings of Spain and Portugal and if this voyage should not have good success we should not only be a scorning or a reproachful scoffing stock unto our enemies but also a great  BLOT  to our whole country for ever and what triumph would it be to Spain and Portugal and again the like would never be attempted  And now restoring every  man again to his former office he ended thus shewing the company that he would satisfy every man or else he would sell all that he ever had even unto his plate for quoth he I have good reason to promise and am best able to perform it for I have somewhat of mine own in England and besides that I have as much adventure in this voyage as three of the best whatsoever and if it so be that I never come home yet will her Majesty pay every man his wages whom indeed you and I all came to serve and for to say you came to serve me I will not give you thanks for it is only her Majesty that you serve and this voyage is only her fitting forth so willing all men to be friends he willed them to depart about their business The th of August they weighed anchor and departed but the day before he came on board the Elizabeth and swore very vehemently I know not upon what occasion that he would hang to the number of in the fleet that had deserved it and then again charged Worrall that his case was worse than Doughty's and that by God's wounds he had deserved to be hanged And Master Winter said he where is your man Ulysses By God's life if he were my man I would cut off his ears nay by God's wounds I would hang him but wherefore truly I do not know"  Nothing can be a clearer proof that Drake had no Government Commission than the above account In his speech which the writer says is nearly in his own words he does not so much as pretend to have received any Commission only a private intimation from the Queen and Walsingham that her Majesty wanted to be revenged of divers injuries received from the King of Spain but was countenancing four or five piratical plunderers to rob innocent people a princely way for one Sovereign to take revenge of another in times of profound peace It was indeed a pitiful connivance in Queen Elizabeh to engage crowns in a piratical adventure of this kind and what could never have been credited of that magnanimous Princess had she not afterwards approved of his piracy by going aboard his ship and openly approving what it was even then said least became a trading nation to encourage the breach of treaties and piratical practices But it is remarkable that five months elapsed after his return to England before her Majesty's pleasure was publicly known during which time men talked var  ously of the expedition and the fate of Drake seemed to hang in suspence so true proved Doughty's prediction that  "the Queen's Majesty and Council might be corrupted"  That Drake bore no naval Commission appears still more clearly from his displacing the Captains and Officers of all his ships without demanding from them their Commissions from his  listing his men not for any hostile expedition but for a trading voyage to Alexandria and from his asking them before his setting sail from the Port of St Julian to enter the South Seas from whom they expected their wages From these circumstances it follows incontestibly that it he had a naval Commission he was the only Officer in the fleet possessed of oneDoughty whom he beheaded and who before their falling out was second in command bore no naval Commission and it is more than probable that this gentleman's questioning the Commission of Drake was the real cause of his death as Drake more than once charges him with the overthrow of the voyage which he could no otherwise effect than by discrediting a Commission on the authority of which both Officers and men were to be persuaded to plunder a people at peace with their nation and without which every man was liable to be executed for piracy whenever he should be overpowered  It were needless for us to enlarge our remarks every reader has now the subject before him and every reader will form a judgment for himself  What we have said in consequence of having traced this transaction from beginning to end may seem to clash with the opinion we previously entertained of Drake's humanity courage and kindness to his followers but will not seem strange to those who are acquainted with the nature of periodical writings where one part of the work is necessarily printed off before the  other is written In pursuing the course of this voyage new authors have been consulted and new lights collected which have enabled us to detect not only the errors of other writers but also to correct our own and from the sequel of this voyage we may venture to foretel that the reader will concur in sentiment with us that though Drake was bold he was not honest that though he did not kill those he plundered and had no motive to destroy he spared none who opposed his designs or who did not pay implicit obedience to his arbitrary will that though he was an able seaman he was a jealous rival and that though he was a gallant leader he was a most tyrannical Commander We shall now accompany him to the South Seas where the Spaniards not suspecting an enemy were in no condition to defend themselves against his attacks  Drake having reduced the number of his ships to three they left the port and on August the th entered the Straits of Magellan in which they struggled with contrary winds and the various dangers which the intricacy of that winding passage exposed them to till night when they had passed the first narrow and had entered a wider sea where they discovered an island to which they gave the name of Elizabeth in honour of their sovereign On the th they came to an island in which they found such an infinite number of birds since called penguins that they killed of them in one day This bird of  which they then knew not the name they describe as somewhat less than a wild goose without feathers and covered with a kind of down unable to fly or rise from the ground but capable of running and swimming with amazing celerity They feed on fishes in the sea and come to land only to rest in the day and lay their eggs which according to later voyagers they deposit in holes as regularly dispersed and as numerous as the cells in a beehive  From these islands to the South Sea the strait becomes very crooked and narrow so that sometimes by the interposition of headlands the passage seems entirely shut up To double these capes they found it very difficult on account of the frequent variations to be made in the course Here are indeed as Magellan observes many harbours but in most of them no bottom is to be found which however does not seem verified by experience the harbours being in general good though the tides and blasts continually rushing in from various directions create the danger The land on both sides rises into innumerable mountains the tops of them were encircled with clouds and vapours which being congealed fall down in snow and increase their height by hardening into ice an observation which might naturally occur to Drake who passed the strait in their winter before the snows were dissolved However even at that season which answers to our February they found the vallies in some places green fruitful and  pleasant Anchoring in a bay near Cape Forward Drake imagining the strait quite shut up went in his boat to endeavour to find some other passage out and having found an inlet towards the North was returning to his ships but curiosity soon prevailed upon him to stop for the sake of observing a canoe or boat with several natives of the country in it He could not at a distance help admiring the form of this little vessel which seemed inclining to a semicircle the stern and prow standing up and the body sinking inward but much greater was his wonder when upon a nearer inspection he found it made only with the barks of trees sewed together with thongs of sealskins so artificially that scarcely any water entered the seams  The people were well shaped and painted like those who have been already described On the land they had a hut built with poles and covered with skins in which they had watervessels and other utensils made likewise with the barks of trees Among these people they had an opportunity of remarking what is frequently observable in savage countries how natural sagacity and unwearied industry may supply the want of such manufactures or natutural productions as appear to us absolutely necessary for the support of life Though the inhabitants were wholly strangers to iron and to the use we make of it yet instead of it they substituted the shell of a muscle of prodigious  size found upon their coasts This they ground upon a stone to an edge which was so firm and solid that neither wood nor stone were able to resist it With instruments made of shells these simple people were able to perform all their mechanic operations nor do they seem so deformed and ugly as our late voyagers represent them who being perhaps more refined than those who sailed with Captain Drake might fancy a greater difference between themselves and these savages than in nature there really is  On this occasion we cannot forbear remarking that though Drake entered the strait in what is accounted the most unfavourable season yet he passed it in sixteen days though at that time wholly unknown a passage the more extraordinary as none of our late voyagers made it in less than thirtysix days in the middle of summer and Captain Wallis was at least four months in making it  Drake as has been said having taken a survey of the country from Cape Forward continued his course to the Northwestward and on the sixth of September entered the great South Sea on which no English vessel had ever been navigated before and proposed to have directed his course towards the Line that his men who had suffered by the severity of the climate might recover their strength in a warmer latitude But his design was scarce formed before it was frustrated for on September the seventh  after an eclipse of the moon a storm arose so violent that it left them little hopes of surviving it nor was its fury so dreadful as its continuance for it lasted with little intermission thirtytwo days in which time they were driven more than leagues out of their course without being able either to avail themselves of their sails or make use of their anchors  In this storm on the th of September the Marigold Captain Thomas was separated from them and on the th of October having entered a harbour where they hoped for some intermission of their fatigues they were in a few hours forced out to sea again by a violent gust at which time they lost sight of the Elizabeth Captain Winter whose crew as was afterwards discovered wearied with labour and discouraged with the prospect of future dangers recovered the straits the day following and returning by the same passage through which they came sailed along the coast of Brazil and in the year following arrived in England  They were now driven southward degrees where they discovered a cluster of islands in one of which they anchored and staid two days to the great refreshment of the crew having met with excellent water and plenty of greens Not far distant from this bay they entered another where they beheld some naked inhabitants ranging along the coast in their canoes in search of provisions With these they exchanged  some toys for such refreshments as they had to spare  And now being furnished with wood and water they again set sail and were by a new storm driven to the latitude of degrees when they beheld the extremities of the American coast and the confluence of the Atlantic and Southern oceans Here they arrived on the th of October and at last were blest with the sight of a calm sea having for almost two months endured such a storm as no voyager has given an account of and such as in that part of the world though accustomed to hurricanes the inhabitants were unacquainted with  On the th of October they steered towards the place appointed for the rendezvouz of the fleet in case of separation which was in degrees south and on the next day discovered two islands so well stocked with fowls that they victualled their ships with them After this supply they sailed northward along the coast of Peru till they came to degrees where finding neither ships nor any convenient port they came to anchor Nov the th at Macao an island inhabited by such Indians as the cruelty of their Spanish conquerors had driven from the continent to whom they applied for water and provisions offering them in return such things as they imagined most likely to please them The Indians seemed willing to traffic and having presented them with  fruits and two fat sheep shewed them a place where they might come for water  Next morning according to agreement the English landed with their watervessels and sent two men forward towards the place appointed who about the middle of the way were suddenly attacked by the Indians and immediately slain Nor were the rest of the company out of danger for behind the rocks was lodged an ambush of men who starting up from their retreat discharged their arrows into the boat with such dexterity that every one of the crew was wounded by them The sea being then high and hindering them from either retiring or making use of their weapons Drake himself received an arrow under his eye which pierced him almost to the brain and another in his breast The danger of these wounds was much increased by the absence of their surgeon who was in the Elizabeth so that they had none to assist them but a boy whose age did not admit of much skill or experience yet so much were they favoured by Providence that they all recovered No reason could be assigned for which the Indians should attack them with so furious a spirit of malignity but that they mistook them for Spaniards whose cruelties might very reasonably incite those to revenge whom they had driven by incessant persecution from their country wasting immense tracts of land by massacre and devastation Nuno da Sylva adds that none of  the Indians were hurt by the English though they came so near the boat as to seize and carry off four of the oars  On the afternoon of the same day they set sail and on the th of November dropt anchor in Phillip's bay where their boat having been sent out to discover the country returned with an Indian in his canoe whom they had intercepted He was of a graceful stature drest in a white coat or gown reaching almost to his knees very mild humble and docile such as perhaps were all the Indians till the Spaniards taught them revenge treachery and cruelty This Indian having been kindly treated was dismissed with presents and informed as far as the English could make him understand what they chiefly wanted and what they were willing to give in return Drake ordered his boat to attend him and set him safe on shore  When he was landed he made signs for the boat to wait till his return and meeting some of his countrymen gave them such an account of his reception that within a few hours several of them repaired with him to the boat with fowls eggs and a hog and with them one of their captains who willingly came into the boat and desired to be conveyed by the English to their ship  By this man Drake was informed that no supplies were to be expected here but that Southward in a place to which he offered to be  his pilot there was great plenty This proposal was accepted and on the th of December under the direction of the goodnatured Indian they came to anchor in the harbour called by the Spaniards Val Parizo in deg min S latitude near the little town of St Jago where they met not only with sufficient stores of provisions and with storehouses full of the wines of Chili but with a ship called the Captain of Morial richly laden having together with large quantities of the same wine some of the fine gold of Baldivia to the amount of threescore thousand pezoes each pezo of the value of eight shillings and a great cross of gold set with emeralds The Spaniards at first mistaking the English for friends invited them to feast with them but soon being undeceived one of the crew jumped overboard and alarmed the town but the inhabitants instead of making opposition fled hastily and left whatever was in the town a prize to the enemy In the chapel Drake and his men found the most valuable booty  Having spent three days here in storing their ships and loading the money and effects they departed and landed their Indian pilot where they first received him after having rewarded him much above his expectations or desires They had now little other anxiety than for their friends who had been separated from them and whom they now determined to seek But considering that by entering every creek and  harbour with their ships they exposed themselves to unnecessary dangers and that their boat could not contain such a number as might defend themselves against the Spaniards they determined to station their ship at some place where they might commodiously build a pinnace which being of light burden might safely sail where the ship would be in danger of being stranded and at the same time carry a sufficient force to resist the enemy and afford better accommodation than it was possible to obtain in the boat To this end on the th of December they entered a bay near Coquimbo a town inhabited by the Spaniards who discovering them immediately issued out to the number of horsemen with about naked Indians running by their sides The English observing their approach retired to their boat without any loss except of one man whom no persuasions or intreaties could move to retire with the rest and who was therefore overtaken by the Spaniards who thought to have taken him prisoner but having an halbert in his hand he manfully defended himself till being overpowered by numbers he was run through the body with a lance The Spaniards exulting at the victory ordered the Indians to draw the dead carcase from the rock on which he fell and in the sight of the English beheaded it and then cut off the right hand and tore out the heart which they carried away in triumph  Leaving this place they soon found a harbour more secure and convenient where they built their pinnace in which Drake went to seek his companions but finding the wind contrary he was obliged to return in two days  From hence they came to a port called Sarcipaxa where being landed they found a Spaniard asleep with silver bars lying by him to the value of Spanish ducats notwithstanding the insults which they had received from his countrymen they did not think fit to disturb this harmless man's repose but taking the silver left him quietly to sleep out his nap  Coasting along the shore they observed a Spaniard driving eight Peruvian sheep which on landing they found to be laden with silver each sheep having lb weight in two leather bags across his back They delivered the poor animals of their heavy burdens and lodged the bags in their own ships  Farther on lay some Indian towns from which the inhabitants repaired to the ship on floats made of sealskin blown full of wind two of which they fasten together and sitting between them row with great swiftness and carry considerable burdens They very readily traded for glass and such trifles with which the old and the young seemed equally delighted  Arriving at Marmarena on the th of January Drake invited the Spaniards to traffic with him which they accepted and supplied him with necessaries selling to him among  other provisions some of those sheep which have been mentioned whose bulk is equal to that of a cow and whose strength is such that one of them can carry three tall men upon his back their necks are like a camel's and their heads like those of our sheep They are the most useful animals of this country not only affording excellent fleeces and wholesome flesh but serving as carriers over rocks and mountains where no other beast can travel for their feet are of a particular form which enables them to tread firm on the steepest and most slippery places  On all this coast it is said the mountains are so impregnated with silver that from one hundred weight of common earth five ounces of fine silver may be separated  They continued their course towards the North and on the th of February arrived at Arica in deg min S latitude and in this port found three small barks in which they found slabs of silver each of the size and shape of an ordinary brick and weighing about lb They took no prisoners for the crews fearing no interlopers were all on shore carousing with one another At this port the Spaniards were wont to land their merchandize and to embark the silver which was transported from thence to Panama but since Drake's incursion they carry their silver over land to Lima and load no more treasure here except what they pay for the purchase of such merchandize as is brought from Europe to supply their market Wanting numbers to  assault the town they proceeded in their course and falling in with a small coastingvessel laden with linen and other cloaths Drake supplied his crew with what quantity of those articles they stood in need of and dismissed the Spaniards with the remainder  From hence they sailed to Chuli in which port there was a ship that had pezoes of silver in bars but the Spaniards had sent an express from Arica to acquaint the Governor that Drake was upon the coast This express arrived at Chuli just two hours before Drake entered the port in which time the master of the ship had thrown his treasure overboard and had secured himself and crew on shore leaving only one Indian on board to make the report Drake fearing the alarm would spread faster than he could sail lost no time in hazardous searches but instantly departed and steered for Lima where they arrived on the th of February and entered the harbour without resistance in which according to some writers there were thirty sail of ships others say twelve but all agree that several of them were of considerable force so that Drake's security consisted not in his strength but in his reputation which had so intimidated the Spaniards that the sight of their own superiority could not rouse them to opposition Instances of such panic terrors are to be met with in other relations but as they are for the most part quickly dissipated by reason and resolution a wise  Sir Francis Drake engaging the Cacafuego a  Spanish Ship  Commander will rarely ground his hopes of success on them and perhaps on this occasion the Spaniards scarcely deserve a severer censure for their cowardice than Drake for his temerity A writer of good authority to reconcile the matter tells us that Drake took them at unawares and that the crews as is usual in times of perfect security were with their families on shore and many of those who were ready to sail were taking leave of their friends Be this as it may all seem to agree that Drake made here a considerable booty having taken from one ship a chest full of rials of plate which he found concealed under the steerage and from other ships silks and linen cloth to a considerable value He did not however remain long in this harbour but hastened in pursuit of the Cacafuego which ship had sailed but three days before and which they were here informed was bound to Paita In the pursuit they fell in with another ship out of which they took a large quantity of gold together with a crucifix of the same metal richly adorned with emeralds They continued the pursuit but having gained intelligence that instead of Paita she was gone to Panama Drake crouded all the sail he could and to encourage the pursuers promised that whoever first descried the prize should have his gold chain as a reward which fell to the lot of his brother John On the st of March they came up with her and after exchanging a few shot they boarded her and found not only a  quantity of jewels and thirteen chests of money but eighty pounds weight of gold and twentysix tons of uncoined silver with services of wrought plate to a great value In unlading this prize they spent six days and then dismissing the Spaniards stood off again to sea  Lopez Vaz a Spanish writer tells us that in less than hours after their departure from Lima in pursuit of the Cacafuego news was brought that Drake was upon the coast but that the Governor had already assembled the force of the country to oppose his landing and that finding he had left the harbour he ordered three ships with six pieces of cannon being all he could collect and men to pursue him but the equipment of these vessels necessarily requiring time Drake had gained the advantage of them and coming within sight of the prize off Cape Francisco the Captain of which Juan de Anton a Biscayan seeing at a distance a ship crouded with sails and imagining the Viceroy of Peru had dispatched her on some message to him struck his sails and lay to till Drake approaching nearer he discovered his mistake He would then have made his escape but Drake nearing him fast with his great ordnance against which the Captain could make no defence he was constrained to yield  "There was in this ship adds the Spaniard eight hundred and fifty thousand pezoes of silver and forty thousand pezoes of gold all which silver and gold was customed but what treasure  they had uncustomed I know not for many times they carry almost as much more as they pay custom for otherwise the King would take it from them if they should be known to have any great sum wherefore every ship carries a bill of custom that the King may see it All the treasure which Drake took was merchants and other mens goods saving pezoes of the king's He had also out of this ship good store of victuals with other necessaries which were to be carried from Panama and was five days in taking out such things as he needed  "This done he sailed to the coast of New Spain without going to Panama The ships that were sent by the viceroy of Peru from Lima arrived off Cape St Francisco days after Drake had taken the Cacafuego and had intelligence by a ship coming from Panama which they met at the said Cape that Francis Drake had taken the ship with silver and was not gone for Panama whereupon the Commander of the three ships thinking that Captain Drake had been gone for the Straits of Magellan directed his course that way to seek him"  Thus Drake changing his course to the west escaped his enemies and fell in with a ship from the East Indies laden with silks China ware and cotton The owner a Spaniard was on board who presented Drake with a falcon wrought in massy gold with an emerald set in  the breast of it the largest he had ever beheld With this present and a golden cup from the pilot Drake was contented and dismissed the ship taking only four chests of China ware which at that time was of great value in Europe  On the th of March they came in sight of land which happened to be a small island about two leagues from the main continent There they found a harbour and anchored in five fathom water where they staid till the th on which day a little coasting frigate passing by was pursued by the pinnace boarded and taken Being laden with sasaparilla honey butter and other country goods Drake unloaded the sasaparilla and in the room of it put the gold and silver from his own ship in order to heave her up to new caulk her sides and stop her leaks in which service the crew were employed till the th of the same month when having reloaded the cargo and taken in a sufficient quantity of wood and water they continued their course westward along the coast taking the Spanish frigate with them to bear them company  On April a little before sunset they discovered a ship that held on her course about two leagues to seaward from the main land To this ship they gave chace and before morning they neared her and suddenly boarded her while the men slept Being masters of this prize without resistance they ordered the prisoners on board their own ship among whom was one Don Francisco Xarate who meant to sail to Panama  and from thence to China with the letters and patents that were found in his possession among which were the letters of the King of Spain to the Governor of the Philippines as also the sea charts wherewith they were to be directed in their voyage which were of admirable use to Drake in his return home From this ship they took great quantities of bale goods and other valuable merchandize and then dismissed her They also took a young negro girl whom Drake or some of his companions having got with child they afterwards inhumanly set her on shore on an island in their way home just as she was ready to lie in of which notice will be taken in its proper place Having retained a Spanish pilot from this ship they obliged him to direct them to a safe harbour where they might supply themselves with provisions for their intended voyage This man brought them to the harbour of Anguatulco or as others write Guatalco where arriving on the th of April they staid till the th of the same month and then set sail having first dismissed all their Spanish prisoners together with Nuno da Sylva the Portugueze pilot whom they brought from the Canaries and who had served them faithfully in all their trials and dangers in reward for which he was now abandoned by Drake to the mercy of the enemy This man when he landed on the continent was first carried to Mexico and there put to the torture to make discoveries He was afterwards sent prisoner into Old Spain and  there examined and having given a faithful relation of all he knew was released and returned home to his own country where he published as has already been said an account of the voyage as far as he went which was afterwards translated into all the European language and universally read  On their arrival at Anguatulco they had no sooner landed than Drake with part of his men marched up to the town where they found the chief magistrate sitting in judgment upon a parcel of poor savages and ready to pass sentence of death upon almost all of them they being charged with a conspiracy to kill their masters and set fire to the town Drake changed the scene and made judges and criminals without distinction his prisoners conducting them all in procession to his ship Here he made the judge write an order to the Commanding Officer to deliver up the town in which they found a great pot says my author as big as a bushel full of rials of plate a gold chain and a few jewels The gold chain was taken from a gentleman who was making his escape from the town but was intercepted by an English sailor who rifled him of all the valuables he had about him of which the gold chain was thought to be of the least value  Being now sufficiently enriched and having given over all hopes of finding their associates and perhaps beginning to be infected with that desire of ease and pleasure which is the natural  Drake Conveying the Spanish Judges and Criminal Savages of Anguatulco in Procession on Board his own Ship  consequence of wealth obtained by successful villainy or what is still more probable being in fear of a surprize before they had secured their booty they began to consult about their return home and in pursuance of Drake's advice resolved first to find out some convenient harbour where they might more safely lie and equip themselves for the voyage and then endeavour to discover a nearer passage from the South Seas into the Atlantic Ocean a passage that would not only enable them to return home with full security and in a shorter time but would much facilitate the navigation into those parts and of course immortalize their names  For this purpose they had recourse to a port in the island of Canes where they met with fish wood and fresh water and being sufficiently stored with other provisions with which they had supplied themselves from their prizes and at Anguatulco they set sail first with a resolution of seeking a passage by the northwest and if that failed by the Moluccas and thence following the course of the Portugueze to return by the Cape of Good Hope  In pursuance of the first resolution they sailed about leagues till coming into the latitude of deg north they found the air so excessive cold that the men could no longer bear to handle the ropes to navigate the ship they therefore changed their course till they came into the latitude of deg and min under which height they discovered a very good harbour  and fortunately had a favourable wind to enable them to enter it  Here on the th of June they cast anchor and in a short time had opportunities of observing that the natives of that country were not less sensible than themselves for the next day there came a man rowing in his canoe towards the ship and at a distance from it made a long oration with very extraordinary gesticulations and great appearance of vehemence and a little time afterwards made a second visit in the same manner and then returning a third time he presented them after his harangue was finished with a kind of crown of black feathers such as their kings wear upon their heads and a basket of rushes filled with a particular herb both which he fastened to a short stick and threw into the boat nor could he be prevailed upon to receive any thing in return though pushed towards him upon a board only he took up a hat that was flung in the water  Three days afterwards the ship having received some damage at sea was brought nearer to land that her lading might be taken out in order to which the English who had now learned not to commit their lives too negligently to the mercy of savage nations raised a kind of fortification with earth and palissades and erected their tents within it All this was not beheld by the inhabitants without the utmost astonishment which incited them to come down in crouds to the coast with no other view as it  afterwards appeared but to compliment the beautiful strangers that had condescended to touch upon their country  Drake neither confiding too much in appearances nor wholly distrusting the friendly disposition of the inhabitants directed them to lay aside their bows and arrows and on their approach presented them with linen and other necessaries of which he shewed them the use They then returned to their habitations about three quarters of a mile from the English camp where they made such loud and violent noises that they were heard by the English who had vanity enough to believe that they were paying them a kind of melancholy adoration  Two days afterwards they perceived the approach of a far more numerous company who stopt at the top of a hill which overlooked the English settlement while one of them made a long oration at the end of which all the assembly bowed their bodies and pronounced the syllable  Oh  with a solemn tone as by way of confirmation of what had been said by the orator Then the men laying down their bows and leaving their women and children on the top of the hill came down towards the tents and seemed transported in the highest degree at the kindness of Drake who received their gifts and admitted them to his presence The women at a distance appeared seized with a kind of phrenzy such as that of old among the Pagans in some of their religious ceremonies and  in honour as it seemed of their guests tore their cheeks and bosoms with their nails and threw themselves upon the stones with their naked bodies  Three days after this on June Drake received two Ambassadors from the Hioh or King of the country who intending to visit the camp required that some token might be sent him of friendship and peace This request was readily complied with and soon after came the King attended by a guard of about an hundred tall men and preceded by an Officer of State who carried a sceptre made of black wood adorned with chains made of a kind of bone or horn which are marks of the highest honour among them Behind him was the King himself dressed in a coat of beasts skins with a crown woven with feathers upon his head His attendants followed dressed nearly in the same manner all but the crown and after them came the common people with baskets platted so artificially that they held water in which by way of present they brought roots and fish  Drake not lulled into security ranged his men in order of battle and waited their approach who coming nearer stood still while the scepterbearer made an oration at the conclusion of which they came again forward at the foot of the hill and then the scepterbearer began a song which he accompanied with a dance in both which the men joined but the women  danced without singing Drake now distrusting them no longer admitted them into his fortification where they continued their song and dance a short time and then both the King and some others of the company made a long harangue in which it appeared by the rest of their behaviour that they entreated them to accept of the government of their country and the King with the concurrence of the rest placed the Crown upon Drake's head graced him with the chains and other signs of authority and saluted him with the title of  Hioh  The kingdom thus offered though of no farther value to him than that it furnished him with present necessaries Drake thought it not prudent for him to refuse and therefore took possession of it in the name of Queen Elizabeth not without ardent wishes that this acquisition might be of use to his native country The kingdom being thus consigned and the grand affair at an end the common people left their King and his Nobles with Drake and dispersed themselves over the camp and when they saw any one that pleased them more than the rest they tore their flesh and vented their outcries as before in token of reverence and respect They then proceeded to shew them their wounds and diseases in hopes perhaps of a miraculous cure to which the English to benefit and undeceive them at the same time applied such remedies as they used on like occasions  They were now grown confident and familiar and came down to the camp every day repeating their ceremonies till they were more fully informed how disagreeable they were to those whose favour they were so studious of obtaining They then visited them without ceremony indeed but with a curiosity so ardent that it left them no leisure to provide the necessaries of life with which the English were therefore obliged to supply them They had then sufficient opportunity to remark the custom and disposition of these new allies whom they found tractable and benevolent strong of body far beyond the English yet unfurnished with weapons either for assault or defence their bows being too weak for any thing but sport Their dexterity in taking fish was such that if they saw them so near the shore that they could come to them without swimming they never missed them  The same curiosity that had brought them in such crouds to the shore now induced Drake and some of his companions to travel up into their country which they found at some distance from the coast very fruitful filled with large deer and abounding with a peculiar kind of cunnies smaller than ours with tails like rats paws such as those of a mole and bags under their chins in which they carry provisions to their young  The houses of the inhabitants were round holes dug in the ground from the brink of which they raise rafters or poles shelving towards the middle where they all met in a  ridge and are crampt together the people lie upon rushes and make the fire in the middle of the house letting the smoke fly out at the door The men are generally naked but the women make a kind of petticoat of bulrushes which they comb like hemp and throw the skin of a deer over their shoulders They are very modest tractable and obedient to their husbands The soil is but badly cultivated but contentment seems to prevail in a very eminent degree among all ranks of this happy people  The land was named by Drake New Albion from its white cliffs in which it bore some resemblance to his native country and the whole history of the resignation of it to the English was engraven on a piece of brass then nailed on a post and fixed up before their departure which being now discovered by the people to be near at hand they could not forbear perpetual lamentations  When the English on the d of July weighed anchor they saw them climbing to the tops of hills that they might keep them in sight and observed fires lighted up in many parts of the country on which as they supposed sacrifices were offered  Near to this harbour they touched at some islands where they found abundance of seals and despairing now to find any passage through the northern regions they after a general consultation determined to steer away to the Moluccas and setting sail July they held a  western course for days without sight of land and on September arrived within view of some islands about deg northward from the Line from whence the inhabitants resorted to them in canoes hollowed in the middle and raised at both ends so high above the water that they seemed almost a semicircle they were burnished in such a manner that they shone like ebony and were kept steady by a piece of timber fixed on each side of them The first company that came brought fruits bananas and other things of no great value with an appearance of traffic and exchanged their lading for other commodities with great show of honesty and friendship But having as they imagined laid all suspicion asleep they sent another fleet of canoes of which the crews behaved with all the insolence of savages and all the rapacity of thieves for whatever was suffered to come into their hands they seemed to consider as their own and would neither pay for it nor restore it and at length finding the English resolved to admit them no longer they discharged a shower of stones from their boats which insult Drake prudently and generously returned by firing his great guns without hurting them at which they were so terrified that they leaped into the water and hid themselves under their canoes  Here we cannot help remarking how nearly this description agrees with the accounts given by the late navigators of the temper and disposition of the inhabitants of the islands lately discovered  between the Tropics Drake indeed found the firing of his guns without hurting them sufficient to intimidate these ignorant people but our later voyagers have thought their vengeance not complete for any slight insult without murdering them by wholesale to strike them with terror The writer of the late voyages says  "Our men shewed as much impatience to destroy them as a sportsman to kill his game"  Having for some time but little wind they did not arrive at the Moluccas till the d of November and then designing to touch at Tidore as they coasted along the island Mutua belonging to the King of Ternate they were visited by his Viceroy who informed them that it would be more advantageous for them to have recourse to his master for supplies than to the Portuguese with whom he was at enmity Drake was by the arguments of the Viceroy prevailed upon to alter his resolution and on November the th cast anchor before Ternate Scarce was he arrived before the Viceroy with others of the chief nobility came out in three large barges rowed by forty men on each side to conduct the ship into a safe harbour and soon after the King himself having received a velvet cloak by a messenger from Drake as a token of peace came with such a retinue and dignity of appearance as was not expected in those remote parts of the world He was received with discharges of cannon and every kind of music  with which he was so much delighted that he invited the performers on board his barge  The King was of a graceful stature and royal carriage of a mild aspect and low voice His attendants were dressed in white cotton or callico of whom some whose age gave them a venerable appearance seemed as counsellors and the rest officers or nobles His guards were not ignorant of firearms but had not many among them being equipped for the most part with bows and darts The King having spent some time in admiring the new objects that presented themselves retired as soon as the ship was brought to anchor and promised to return on the day following and in the mean time the inhabitants having leave to traffic brought down provisions in great abundance The King came not aboard according to his promise but sent his brother to excuse him and withal to invite Drake ashore proposing to stay himself as an hostage for his return Drake declined going himself but sent some gentlemen of his retinue in company with the King's brother and kept the Viceroy till their return  These gentlemen were received by another of the King's brothers and conducted in great state to the castle where there was a court of at least persons among whom were threescore ancient men privy counsellors to the King and on each side of the gate without stood four old men of foreign countries who served as interpreters in commerce In a short  time appeared the King himself drest in Cloth of gold with his hair woven into gold ringlets a chain of gold upon his neck and on his fingers rings very artificially set with diamonds and jewels of great value Over his head was borne a rich canopy and by his chair of state stood a page with a fan set with sapphires to moderate the excess of the heat Here he received the compliments of the English and then honourably dismissed them The castle which they had some opportunity of observing seemed of no great force It was built by the Portuguese who attempting to reduce this kingdom into absolute subjection murdered the King and intended to pursue their plot by the destruction of all his sons But the general abhorrence which cruelty and perfidy naturally excite armed the whole nation against them and procured their total expulsion from all the dominions of Ternate which from that time increasing in power continued to make new conquests and to deprive them of other acquisitions  Here they shipt between four and five tons of cloves intending to bring them to Europe While they lay before Ternate a gentleman came on board attended by his Portuguese interpreter He was dressed somewhat in the European manner and soon distinguished himself from the natives of Ternate or any country they had ever yet seen by his civility and quick comprehension Such a visitant may easily be  imagined to excite their curiosity which he gratified by informing them that he was a native of China of the family of the King then upon the throne and that being accused of a capital crime of which though he was innocent he had not sufficient evidence to clear himself he had petitioned the Emperor that he might not be exposed to a trial but that his cause might be referred to Divine Providence and that he might be allowed to leave his country with a prohibition against returning unless heaven in attestation of his innocence should enable him to bring back to the King some intelligence that might be to the honour and advantage of the Empire of China In search of such information he had now spent three years and left Tidore for the sake of conversing with the English General from whom he hoped to receive such accounts as would enable him to return with honour and safety Drake whether he credited or disbelieved his story caused a recital to be made by one of the company who talked the language of the interpreter of such adventures and observations as he judged would be most pleasing to his visitor to all which the Chinese Exile gave the utmost attention and having caused them to be repeated a second time to impress them in his mind thanked the Creator of the World for the knowledge he had gained He then proposed to the General to sail to his country to which he willingly undertook to be his pilot  but Drake could not be induced to prolong his voyage  He therefore set sail on Nov the th in quest of a more convenient harbour where he might clean and refit his ship which by the length of the voyage and the heat of the climate was now become foul and leaky Directing his course southward he soon fell in with an uninhabited island which by its appearance promised fair to answer his purpose At a distance it looked like a beautiful grove the trees were large strait and lofty but what was more extraordinary they were interspersed with such an astonishing number of shining flies that the whole island in the night seemed to glow with fire Here they found a convenient haven and here they landed and continued days They found upon this island tortoise but of a monstrous size and various sorts of fruits of a delicious flavour  Leaving this place on the th of December they cruelly deserted the unhappy mulatto girl whom they had taken for their pleasure from a ship that fell into their hands on the coast of New Spain They had at the same time taken on board a negroe youth who they thought might be serviceable to them in conversing with his nation in their way home but finding him of little or no use on board and provisions beginning to fail they pretended to send this simple couple far into the country to gather fruits and in the mean time unmoored  the ship and hoisted sail and before the return of the victims were out of sight of their tears and out of hearing of their cries a melancholy instance this of the depravity of man's heart and of the relentless cruelty of minds addicted to rapine and lust The poor girl not yet fifteen was ready to be delivered of an innocent babe and the youth not twenty was the only resource in the midst of her distress What befel them cannot be known but Providence seemed to punish the perfidy of the crew by a severe trial of their fortitude soon after  Having a wind not very favourable they happened to be intangled among a multitude of islands interspersed with dangerous shallows till January the th When they thought themselves clear and were sailing along with a brisk gale they were at the beginning of the night suddenly surprized in their course by a sudden shock the cause of which was instantly discovered for they were thrown upon a concealed rock and by the speed of their course fixed too fast for any hope of escaping  Here the intrepidity of Drake was shaken and his dexterity baffled here all the horrors of mind attendant on conscious guilt concurred to aggravate the distress of those who were instrumental in abandoning the harmless slaves Those who were innocent reproached the guilty with being the authors of their present distress and among the rest Mr Fletcher the Chaplain exclaimed against the Captain as one whose crimes of murder and lust had brought down  divine vengeance on all the company Drake who knew well how to dissemble his resentment judging this an improper time to encourage disputes endeavoured by every means in his power to appease the increasing animosity To preserve therefore the minds of the company at rest he found it necessary to keep their hands employed and for that purpose ordered the pumps to be constantly plied Convinced by this experiment that the water did not gain upon them in the hold he conceived hopes that by lightening the ship they might possibly be able to heave her off He knew it would be in vain to persuade them to part with their treasure and therefore he first caused the guns to be thrown overboard and then the spices and afterwards the watercasks to be bulged being in hopes that if they could be released water might again be supplied from the neighbouring islands some of which were at no great distance His next attempt was to discover about the shallows some place where they might six an anchor in order to bring their ship to and by that means clear her from the rock but upon examination it was found that the rock on which they had struck rose as many others in those seas do almost perpendicular and that there was no anchorage nor any bottom to be fathomed a boat's length from the ship But this discovery was by Drake wisely concealed from the common sailors lest they should abandon themselves to despair for which there was indeed much cause there being no prospect left  but that they must there sink along with the ship  In this deplorable situation they had remained for four and twenty hours when Drake finding all human efforts vain addressed himself to his companions in distress and exhorted them to lay aside all animosities and prepare themselves by forgiving each other for obtaining that mercy through Christ which they could not hope to receive on any other terms  "On this occasion" says my author "every thief reconciled himself to his fellowthief and Fletcher administered the sacrament to them all"  At length when their hopes had forsaken them and no new struggles could be made they were on a sudden relieved by the wind's shifting and a fresh breeze springing up which taking the ship on the leeward quarter she reeled off the rock without receiving any very dangerous hurt to the unspeakable joy of every soul on board  This was the greatest and most inextricable distress which they had suffered and made such an impression upon their minds that for some time afterwards they durst not adventure to spread their sails but went slowly forward with the utmost circumspection till arriving at the fruitful island of Baretene they entered the port to repair what damage the ship had received upon the rock They found the people of this island of an amiable and obliging disposition courteous in their manners and honest  in their dealings They are finely proportioned tall of stature and of comely features The men in general go naked but the women cover themselves from the waist downwards are modest yet not insensible of love and pleasure They found the island abounding with every necessary and not a few of the comforts of life  Having repaired the ship and refreshed the men they continued their course without any material occurrence till the th of March when they came to anchor before the island of Java and sending to the King a present of cloth and silks received from him in return a present supply of refreshments and on the day following Drake went himself on shore and entertained the King with music and obtained leave to store his ship with provisions This island was governed by a great number of petty Kings or Rayas subordinate to one Chief Of these princes three came on board together a few days after their arrival and having upon their return recounted the wonders they had seen and the civilities with which they had been treated incited others to satisfy their curiosity in the same manner and Raya Denan the chief King came himself to view the ship with the warlike armaments and instruments of navigation This intercourse of civilities somewhat retarded the business for which they came but at length they not only victualled their ship but payed the bottom which was the  more necessary frequently to be repeated as at that time sheathing of ships was not in practice  The Javans were at this time a warlike people well armed with swords targets and daggers forged by themselves and exquisitely wrought They were sociable full of vivacity and beyond description happy They were likewise hospitable to strangers and not at all addicted to thievery the general characteristic of the islanders in the Pacific Sea  From Java Drake intended to have visited the Malaccas but his company became troublesome being desirous of returning home On this occasion he called to mind the speech of Master Fletcher while they remained hopeless upon the rock and under pretence of his spiriting up the people to oppose him he caused him says my author  "to be made fast by one of his legs with a chain and a staple knocked fast into the hatches in the forecastle of the ship He called all the company together and then put a lock about one of his legs and Drake sitting crosslegged on a chest and a pair of pantofles in his hand he said Francis Fletcher I do here excommunicate thee out of the Church of God and from all the benefits and graces thereof and I renounce thee to the devil and all his angels and then he charged him upon pain of death not once to come before the must for if he did he swore he should  be hanged and Drake caused a posey to be written and bound about Fletcher's arm with charge that if he took it off he should then be hanged the posey was FRANCIS FLETCHER THE FALSEST KNAVE THAT LIVETH"  It does not however appear how long he was obliged to wear this posey as it is called But Drake was obliged to alter his resolution and comply with the company's desires  On the th of March he therefore took his departure and on the th of June they doubled the Cape of Good Hope having then on board his ship fiftyseven men and but three casks of water  On the th of July they passed the Line reached the coast of Guinea on the th and on July the d arrived at Sierra Leona after a most delightful passage in which they discovered how much the Portuguse had abused the world in their false representations of the horrors and dangers that attended the navigation round the Cape At Sierra Leona they staid two days to refresh the men and having furnished themselves with wood and water for the remainder of the voyage they set sail for England in high expectation of enjoying in their own country the spoils they had taken from the Spaniards  On the th of September they made the island of Ferara and on the third of November they entered the harbour of Plymouth in this voyage Drake surrounded the world  which no Commander in Chief had ever done before and what at that time appeared a thing extraordinary by steering a western course they had lost a day in their account  Their success in this voyage and the immense wealth  Lopez Vaz a Spanish writer says that Drake carried from the coast of Peru pezoes of silver equal to quintals equal to pound weight each quintal amounting to ducats He also carried away pezoes of gold equal to quintals each quintal value at Spanish ducats and all this over and above the treasure in the ship which was not entered consisting of gold silver pearls precious stones coined money and other things of great value He also rifled the ships from the Philippines laden with spices silks velvets and other rich merchandize the value not knownBy the above account the silver only at s per oz amounts to l and the gold to l sterl But we have seen a manuscript that makes the value of the whole cargo brought home by the Golden Hnrd for that was the name that Drake chose his ship the Pelican should be known by amount to l though that which was divided among the crew was only l  reasonable then to conclude that the Queen  a considerable share of the remainder  they brought home raised much discourse throughout the kingdom some highly commending and some as loudly decrying the principles upon which it was acquired The former alledged that this enterprize was not only honourable to the Commander who conducted and the crew who assisted in the performance of it but to their country that it would establish our reputation for maritime skill in foreign nations and raise a laudable spirit of emulation at home and that as to the money our merchants having suffered deeply by the treachery  and villainy of the Spaniards in the new discovered country there was nothing more just than that the nation should receive an equivalent by the reprisals which Drake and his company at the hazard of their lives had bravely extorted  The other party argued that Drake in fact was no better than a pirate that of all others it least became a trading nation to countenance such depredations that the expedition was not only a breach of all our treaties with Spain but likewise of our old leagues with the House of Burgundy and that the consequences would infallibly involve the Queen in a war by which the nation would suffer infinitely more than the riches acquired by a single ship could counterbalance  These were the sentiments and these the speculations with which the different parties amused themselves for some time after the arrival of Drake in his native country At length the approbation of the Queen determined the dispute for all acquiesced in the wisdom of their Sovereign  On the th of April her Majesty went to Deptford and dined on board the ship in which so many Kings had been entertained before and after dinner she conferred the honour of knighthood on her Commander an honour not to be obtained in those days on trivial occasions but as a reward for signal services This mark of distinction was a full declaration of her Majesty's approbation silenced Drake's enemies and gave joy to his friends She likewise gave  directions for the preservation of the ship that it might remain a monument of his own and his country's glory  What contributed the more to render the fame of Drake illustrious was the frequent attempts that had been made by navigators the most renowned in their time to atchieve the same but without success In the Spaniards sent Gracca de Loaisa a Knight of Malta with a squadron of seven ships to follow the rout of Magellan who though his ship returned to Spain yet he himself lost his life before he arrived at the Malaccas the promised islands Loaisa passed the straits indeed lost some of his ships in the South Seas others put into the ports of New Spain and only his own vessel and one more reached the East Indies where himself and all his people perished  In the Genoese sent two ships to pass the straits of which one was cast away and the other returned home without effecting any thing  Sebastian Cabot in the service of the crown of Portugal made the like trial but not being able to find the straits returned into the river of Plate  Americus Vespusius a Florentine from whom the new world received its name undertook to perform in the service of the crown of Portugal what Cabot had promised without effect but that vain man was still more unfortunate for he could neither find the straits nor the river of Plate  Some years after this the Spaniards equipped a stout squadron under the command of Simon de Alcasara but before they reached the height of the straits the crews mutinied and obliged their Commander to return  Such repeated miscarriages discouraged even the ablest and boldest seamen so that from this time both Spaniards and others dropped all thoughts of emulating Magellan till Drake conceiving his designs as has already been said concealed it in his breast till ripe for execution  Being now advanced to eminence in he was employed in the Queen's service and sent on an expedition to the West Indies as Commander in Chief and having under him Captain Martin Forbisher Captain Knollys and other experienced Officers of the royal navy he took St Jago St Domingo Carthagena and St Augustin He returned elated with his success but as my author says not much enriched by the plunder  In he was again employed in an expedition to Lisbon in which Captain Forbisher also bore a part Here they gained intelligence that a considerable fleet was assembled in the bay of Cadiz with a view to the forming an armament for the invasion of England he immediately repaired to their place of rendezvouz and fell upon them at unawares and as it is said burnt tons of shipping with all the stores which they were amassing for the intended invasion  In their return they fell in with a carrack from the East Indies richly laden of which they likewise got intelligence in the port of Lisbon This was the St Philip of which Linschoten gives the following account when this Dutchman was at Goa the chief settlement of the Portuguese in the East Indies  "There came in he says from the island of Japan certain Jesuits and with them three Princes being the children of so many Kings of that country wholly apparelled like Jesuits not one of them above the age of years being minded by the persuasion of the Jesuits to visit Portingall and from thence to go to Rome to see the Pope thereby to procure great profit privileges and liberties for the missionaries in that island  "In they set sail for Portingallo and from thence travelled into Spain where by the King and all the Spanish nobility they were with honour received and presented with many gifts which the Jesuits kept for themselves  "Out of Spain they rode to see the Pope that done they travelled throughout Italy where they were much honoured and presented with many rich presents by means of the great report the Jesuits made of them  "To conclude they returned to Madrid where with great honour they took their leave of the King who furnished them with letters of recommendation to the Viceroy and all  the Portingall Governors of India so they went to Lisbon and there took shipping in and came to Goa in the ship called St Philip which ship in her return to Portingall was taken by Captain Drake being the first that was taken coming from the East Indies which the Portugueze took for an evil sign because the ship bore the King's own name" both Spain and Portugal being at that time governed by the same sovereign  "When the Princes and Jesuits of Japan arrived at Goa on their return from Europe they were received adds Linschoten with great rejoicings for it was verily thought they had all been dead On their landing they were all three apparelled in cloth of gold and silver after the Italian manner being the same the Italian noblemen and gentlemen had given them They came to Goa very lively and in high spirits and the Jesuits were not a little proud that through their means the voyage had heen successfully performed In Goa they staid till the monsoon or time of the winds setting in to sail for China and thence to Japan where with great triumph and wondering of all the people they were received and welcomed home to the great furtherance of the Jesuits"  The St Philip in her voyage to Goa had been driven by stress of weather into Masambique where she met with the St Laurence homeward bound that had likewise been driven into the  same port disabled having lost her masts and received other considerable damage by which she was rendered unserviceable The St Philip therefore as soon as she had landed her passengers at Goa returned to Masambique and took in the lading of the St Laurence which enabled her to make her voyage to Europe about the usual time a circumstance fortunate for Drake as it increased both his fame and his fortune  In Drake was appointed ViceAdmiral under Charles Lord Effingham Howard HighAdmiral of England to oppose the formidable armada that had for three years before been secretly preparing in Spain for the invasion of England In Drake's letter to Lord Treasurer Burleigh acquainting him with the approach of the Spaniards he concludes with this elegant compliment to his superior  "That though the strength of the enemy out went report yet the chearfulness and courage which the Lord Admiral expressed gave all who had the honour to serve under him assurance of victory"  a compliment which was the more admired in Drake as in a former letter to the same Minister in which he tells him of his gallant atchievement in the port of Cadiz  "Not resting said he at Lisbon we sailed so close to the Spanish King  that we signed his beard  "  a coarse metaphor it must be owned but strongly characteristic  Drake's good fortune still accompanied him for in the engagement which afterwards happened on the arrival of the armada though he committed  the greatest error that ever Commander was guilty of by pursuing some hulks belonging to the Hans Towns for plunder when he was entrusted to carry lights in the night for the direction of the English fleet he misled the Admiral yet he was the only Commander who profited most by the destruction of the enemy Lord Howard supposing the lights of the Spanish Admiral to be the lights which Drake was ordered to carry was entangled in the very centre of the Spanish fleet before he found his mistake but fortunately night favouring his escape he disengaged himself before he was discovered This blunder was afterwards effaced by the gallant behaviour of Drake than whom no man was ever bolder or more determined We do not however find his name among the Commanders whom the Lord High Admiral thought proper to thank for their services on that occasion On the d of July says Strype Sir Francis observing a large Spanish galleon commanded by Don Pedro de Valdez who was the reputed projector of the invasion floating at a distance from both fleets sent his pinnace to summon the Captain to surrender who at first vauntingly set him at defiance but being told it was Drake that required him to yield he immediately struck his colours and with of his crew came on board the conqueror In this ship he found ducats with other effects to a much greater amount  The next year he was appointed Admiral of a squadron sent to place Don Antonio on the throne of Portugual to which that Prince pretended to have a right  "But says Rapin whose account of this expedition we shall follow as the Queen was extremely frugal and an undertaking against Spain could not but be very expensive she so ordered it that Drake and Norris took upon them to be at the charge in hopes of making themselves amends by the booty they should meet with So she only found them six ships of war with a present of l with leave to raise soldiers and sailors for the expedition Drake had already tried the Spaniards in America and in the channel and was convinced they were more formidable in common opinion than in reality wherefore joining with Sir John Norris and some other private persons they equipped a fleet and embarked soldiers and marines The Hollanders having also added some ships the fleet consisted according to Stow of sail transports and victuallers included Drake commanded at sea and Norris was General of the land forces They took with them Don Antonio who hoped by the assistance of the English to be put in possession of his kingdom where he pretended to have many friends  "They sailed from Plymouth on the th of April and soon after arrived at the Groyne where landing their troops they assaulted the  lower town and carried it by storm Then they besieged the upper town But Norris having advice that the Conde di Andrada was approaching with a body of troops to relieve the place suddenly raised the siege to march against him and overtaking him slew of his men This done he burnt several villages and without returning to the siege reembarked his troops their principal design being against Portugal  "Whilst they were sailing towards the coasts of that kingdom they were joined by the Earl of Essex with some ships he had armed at his own charge unknown to the Queen Some days after they arrived at Panicha a little town in Portugal and taking it restored it to Don Antonio from thence Norris marched by land to Lisbon Drake promising to follow with the fleet up the Yagus The army marched miles without opposition and encamping before Lisbon took the suburbs of St Catharine but as Drake performed not his promise and the army wanted cannon and ammunition it was resolved in a council of war to retire This resolution was taken because there was no appearance that the Portuguese were inclined to revolt as Don Antonio had expected and also because there was no news of the succours he had boasted of from the King of Morocco The army marching towards the mouth of the Tagus met Drake who had taken the town  of Cascaes and excused himself upon the impossibility of performing his promise Some days after the castle of Cascaes surrendering it was blown up and to make themselves amends for the charges of the expedition the English seized sixty vessels laden with corn and all manner of naval stores to equip a new fleet against England belonging to the Hans Towns Then they went and took Vigo which was abandoned by the inhabitants and firing the town returned to England This expedition did some damage to the King of Spain but was of no benefit to Elizabeth and the booty was not sufficient to pay for equipping the fleet though Camden says they brought home pieces of heavy cannon and a great booty Above six thousand men perished in this expedition by sickness"  The writers of Drake's life say that Norris grievously reproached Drake with breach of his promise and charged the miscarriage of the expedition to his timidity Indeed Drake's good genius seems now to have forsaken him and happy say the same writers if having received this first check at play he had withdrawn his stake  As the war with Spain continued Hawkins and Drake who as it should seem wanted to continue their old game where the profits were more and the danger less united their interest to persuade the Queen and Council to undertake an effectual expedition to the West Indies by  which the nation might be enriched and the enemy deprived of those resources by which they were enabled to carry on the war  For this purpose they procured according to Rapin twentysix of the queen's ships the equipment of which like the former seems to have been supplied by private adventure a practice at that time very common where plunder was to be the reward The preparations for this expedition however as it far exceeded all former enterprizes to the American Indies could not be made so privately or conducted so secretly but that the Spaniards found means to discover both its strength and destination and prepared themselves accordingly  As the places that were to be attacked lay at a great distance it was necessary to gain time in order to fortify them It was therefore found necessary to devise some expedient to prevent the sailing of that formidable armament till every thing was in readiness to oppose it Accordingly it was given out that a second invasion was intended against England and when the Spanish fleet was ready to sail for America that had been equipping under pretence of an invasion a sham attack was made upon Cornwall in order to spread an alarm and give it countenance  This had the desired effect It was thought improper to part with so many stout ships while the nation was threatened and the expedition was therefore retarded till the panic had subsided  It was therefore the th of August in before the Commanders obtained permission to sail and in the mean time the Queen having received advice that the plate fleet was safe arrived in Eorope and that only one ship which had sprung her mast remained behind her Majesty acquainted them with the intelligence and advised them to attack Porto Rico before they pursued their grand enterprize by which they might make themselves masters of the galleon without losing much time in the conquest  Sir Francis Drake who was not formed to act in conjunct expeditions had not been long at sea before he differed in opinion from his fellow Commander and pursued a project totally different from the first object of the voyage in which however he was seconded by Sir Thomas Baskerville Commander of the land forces This scheme was to attack the Canaries in the way to America in which however they failed and spending necessarily much time in the island of Dominica in landing and refreshing the men who being unused to long voyages in hot climates were many of them unfit to proceed the Spaniards had so effectually prepared themselves that when the Generals came to action they found an opposition very different from what they expected and were soon sensible that what they had formerly effected by surprize with a handful of sailors was not now to be accomplished with a whole army of disciplined troops  In their course to Porto Rico one of the sternmost ships of the English fleet fell into the hands of five Spanish frigates that had been sent from Spain to convoy home the galleon from that port From this ship they gained the intelligence of the intended attack the consequences of which being foreseen by Sir John Hawkins it threw him into a sudden disorder of which in a few days he diedsome say of a broken heart  They were now Nov before Porto Rico and the same Evening that Sir John Hawkins died as the principal officers were at supper a cannonshot from the port pierced the cabin killed Sir Nicholas Clifford wounded Captain Stratford mortally wounded Sir Brute Browne and struck the stool from under Sir Francis Drake as he was drinking success to the attack  The next day pursuant to a resolution of a council of war a general attack was made upon the shipping in the harbour but without effect The Spaniards suffered much but the English more who finding it impossible to make an impression upon the fortifications of the town weighed anchor and steered to Rio de la Hacha set fire to the town and burned it to the ground they likewise performed some other exploits of the like kind but having landed the troops destined to cross the isthmus to attack Panama after a fatiguing march in which they were great sufferers they returned without being able to  reach the place This disappointment materially affected Drake who having as he thought provided a sufficient force to carry into execution the enterprize which he had wellnigh effected with a few sailors and Symerons some years before could not bear the thought of surviving his disgrace  "Now says Fuller began the discontent of Sir Francis Drake to feed upon him He conceived that expectation a merciless usurer computing each day since his departure exacted an interest and return of honour and profit proportionable to his great preparations and transcending his former atchievements He saw that all the good which he had done in his voyage consisted in the evil he had done the Spaniards afar off whereof he could present but small visible fruits in England These apprehensions accompanying if not causing the disease of the flux wrought his sudden death and sickness did not so much untie his cloaths as sorrow did rend at once the robe of his mortality asunder He lived by the sea died on it and was buried in it"  This account of the manner of Sir Francis Drake's death seems to be authentic though some have not scrupled to insinuate that sickness had no part in that catastrophe Be that as it may Fuller's reflections upon it deserve to be remembered  "Thus says he we see how great spirits having mounted to the highest pitch of performance afterwards strain and  break their credit in striving to go beyond it Or it may be God oftentimes leaves the brightest men in an eclipse to shew that they do but borrow their lustre from his reflection"  Thus we have endeavoured to trace the actions of this celebrated navigator from beginning to end If we have withdrawn the veil which has hitherto covered his infirmities it has been in the pursuit of truth not with a design to detract from his real merit but to shew his character in the true light In the current of success crimes of the deepest die are sometimes even patronized by the public The actions which gave rise to Drake's popularity are such as a courageous leader with an hundred armed followers might in these peaceable times easily perform by entering the cities or towns on the coast of Britain in the dead of night cutting the throats of the watch and all who happen to be awake in the streets breaking open and plundering houses and churches seizing every thing valuable that should fall into their hands and before the people could recover from their consternation making their escape with their booty Were such a company masters of an armed vessel if there were no ship of force to oppose them what should hinder their sailing from place to place and  provided they could outrun report  performing the like exploits in every town they came to Would there be anything truly great in this Or would the man  who should undertake and execute an enterprize of such a horrid nature be justly entitled to the name of Hero If not what shall we say of Drake's nocturnal enterprize on Nombre de Dios of his waylaying the treasure in the road from Panama of his ranging the unarmed coasts of Chili and Peru and of his plundering villages towns and ships belonging to a peaceable unsuspecting people with whom his nation was at peace and from whom opposition was not to be dreaded What indeed did the people at that time say Those who were the sufferers cried out loudly against the plunderer and Bernardine de Mendoza the Spanish Ambassador at the court of Queen Elizabeth insisted that he should be punished for his robberies and that all the money and effects he had seized should be restored but if the Queen was a private adventurer as from Drake's declaration to his followers and from other instances of the womanish littlenesses of that Princess there is reason to suspect What hope was there of justice or restitution from remonstrance Indeed it served that avaricious Queen for a pretence to sequester the treasure which Drake brought home and to convert it is probable the greatest part of it to her own use for as we have already shewn from good authority in a note though the whole booty was valued at l yet only l was divided among the plunderers and Rapin tells us that some part of the treasure was afterwards repaid  by the Queen to Spain If she had not retained enough in her hands no one will suppose that the Sovereign who could cause the goods of her favourite Leicester to be set to public sale after his death for the payment of money she had lent him would have repaid to Spain from her own coffers the plunder that had been unjustly taken by one of her meaner subjects  To dignify actions therefore of the most infamous piracy with the name of great is to exalt vice and to substitute successful villainy in the place of substantial virtue If we view Drake in the light of a courageous plunderer he may vie with the De la Poles the Blackbeards or any of those daring disturbers of the times in which they lived who struck a panic wherever they roved to commit their ravages but consider him as a Commander employed in the defence of his country and we shall see nothing to admire except his courage In the first enterprize in which he was engaged he was indeed successful The Queen suspecting an intention in Philip of Spain to revenge the injuries his subjects had received pitched upon Drake who had given the offence as the fittest man to prevent the consequences He therefore as he had done before attacked the enemy by surprize and set fire to a defenceless number of transports assembled in the harbour of Cadiz without a ship of war to protect them or a gun fired by way of opposition The accident which afterwards threw the rich India ship in his way  on his return home did him no honour as a Commander though it gave him credit as a fortunate adventurer nor did his behaviour in the Channel when instead of maintaining his post he pursued the Hans merchant ships add at all to his reputation as a ViceAdmiral His American enterprize with Lord Carlisle was attended with no laurels and the only two enterprizes in which he was employed in a joint command he ruined by his perfidy and selfconceit  It may indeed be urged in Drake's defence that it was the policy of the Queen his Sovereign to countenance her subjects in distressing Spain and in mortifying the haughty monarch who sat upon the throne and that almost all the heroes of her active reign acquired their glory by practices founded on the same prevailing principle  This argument in his favour cannot be denied its due weight The expeditions of Sir John Hawkins of Sir Walter Raleigh of Lord Carlisle of Sir John Norris of the earl of Essex of Cavendish and indeed of most others undertaken against Spain were professedly with a view to plunder and the charges of fitting them out were chiefly borne by those who were to be sharers in the booty yet surely there is a material difference between the glory that is purchased by valour in the field and fame that is acquired by compacts to surprize the innocent and invade the property of the peaceable  Having now seen Drake in two distinct points of view as a leader of a company of plunderers and as a Commander in the royal navy let us do justice to his character by viewing him as a mariner and in that light he will hardly have his equal To project a voyage round the globe and to conduct it without the assistance of a single mariner on board who had ever crossed the Line Nuno da Silva the Portuguese pilot excepted was perhaps one of the boldest exploits that ever man performed His navigating his ships along the coast of Brazil his carrying them through the straits of Magellan in a shorter time than any mariner has ever done since his keeping the sea in a storm for thirty days together in a small vessel his skill in navigating the coasts of Chili Peru and New Spain where no English ship had ever sailed his accuracy in discovering the track of the Spanish ship from the East Indies and his consummate sagacity in pursuing a new course home to avoid pursuers cannot be enough admired or applauded His knowledge of the globe is manifest from the first attempt he made to return home by a northern passage a passage which he knew would not only secure him from the danger of pursuers but were it practicable would open a free intercourse between his nation and the rich inhabitants of that opulent country in which he was then situated Finding himself however disappointed in this design how great was his sagacity in the discovery of an unknown country wherein to repair  his ship refresh his followers take in wood and water and to supply himself with every necessary for the vast voyage by sea he was to encounter and yet such was his knowledge in making provision against every contingency that might happen that he lost but one man by sickness during the long run from the coast of New Spain to the Ladrones in which Commodore Anson lost near half his crew Nor is his skill less to be admired in his return from the Ladrones the most dangerous navigation of any part of the known world for except the accident upon the rock as has already been related he sailed from the Ladrones to Java unembarrassed from Java to Sierra Leona on the coast of Africa without touching at any port or encountering any difficulty save from a scarcity of water a thing hardly to be credited and which was never performed by any mariner before his time or since  THE VOYAGES OF CAPT THOMAS CAVENDISH THE SECOND ENGLISH NAVIGATOR WHO SAILED ROUND THE WORLD  THIS Gentleman was descended from an antient family in Suffolk whose ancestors came into England with William the Conqueror His father William Cavendish of Trimley St Martin near Ipswich dying young left his son Thomas a minor and heir to the manors of Trimley Stratton and Grimston with other lands of inheritance to a very considerable amount but this youth whose atchievements we are about to relate being of a high spirited disposition and as soon as he came of age subject to no controul fell early into the fashionable gallantries and vices of the times and dissipated the best part of his ample fortune before he entertained any thoughts of applying to business or perhaps was sensible how deeply his affairs were embarrassed  But he no sooner began to reflect and to perceive that without application to some kind of employment he must be undone than he made choice of a seafaring life not only as most suitable to his unsettled turn of mind but also as the most likely means of restoring his fortune and establishing his credit  The kingdom was now involved in war with the Spaniards the then most powerful and consequently the haughtiest and most formidable people in Europe who drawing immense riches from their new acquisitions in America not only raised the envy but the enmity of other powers by their pride and their perfidy  Gentlemen of fortune and gentlemen of no fortune were about this time equally encouraged to distress the enemy The war laid open an immense field for enterprize and every one was at liberty to share the harvest who was willing to bestow the pains of gathering the produce and bringing it home  Among the most active and the most indefatigable was Sir Walter Raleigh who not only was the most experienced but the most successful leader of his time With him our adventurer first determined to embark and as Sir Walter had just projected a new Voyage to America at his own charge he was ready enough to admit associates who were able and willing to bear a part of the expence Unfortunately for our new adventurer all the advantage he derived from this project was only in the knowledge he obtained of sea affairs and of the temper and genius of the people with whom he had to deal for the profits that accrued from the voyage by no means answered the sums employed in pursuing it He observed that by means of their great riches the Spaniards could command intelligence of all that was in agitation against  them on this side the globe but that if they were to be taken off their guard the southern hemisphere must be the place of action He had already an example in Sir Francis Drake of the immense wealth that was to be acquired on the coast of Peru if secrecy could be preserved and he determined to be upon his guard and to keep his design solely within his own breast  With this view he sold a part of the remains of his estate and set about building two ships proper for his enterprize at Harwich at that time an obscure port namely one called the  Desire  of tons and another of called the  Content  to these he added the  Hugh Gallant  a bark of tons In the equipment of this little squadron he purchased many articles of commerce to cover his design and then privately laid in guns ammunition and stores with a moderate quantity of provisions intending to purchase the rest at some other convenient port when he was just ready to depart  He likewise enlisted but half his complement of men and when he arrived at Plymouth he supplied the rest In the whole conduct of what has been already related he was his own sole director and none of those who sailed with him knew whither he was bound till after their embarkation at Plymouth It is even uncertain whether Lord Hounsdon who procured his commission knew the place of his destination  An enterprize so well concerted cannot fail to excite curiosity and as it was excellently written by Mr Pretty brother to Sir William who accompanied Cavendish throughout the voyage it will best appear in its ancient dress  "We departed says Mr Pretty out of Plymouth on Thursday the st of July with three sails to wit the Desire a ship of tons the Content of tons and the Hugh Gallant a bark of tons in which small fleet were persons of all sorts with all kind of furniture and victuals sufficient for the space of two years On Tuesday the th of the same month we were fortyfive leagues from Cape Finis Terrae where we met with five sails of Biscayers coming from the Grand Bay in Newfoundland as we supposed which our Admiral shot at and fought with them three hours but we took none of them by reason the night grew on  The st of August we came in sight of Fort Ventura one of the isles of the Canaries about ten o'clock in the morning  On Sunday being the th of August we were gotten as high as Rio del Oro on the coast of Barbary  On Monday the th we fell in with Cape Blanco but the wind blew so much at the North that we could not get up where the Canters do use to ride and fish therefore we lay off six hours westsouthwest because of the  sand which lieth off the Cape southwest and by south  The th day of the same month we were in the height of Cape Verd by estimation fifty leagues off the same The th Sierra Leona did bear east of us being forty leagues from us and the same day the wind shifted to the northwest so that by the th day of the said month we were in six degrees thirty minutes to the northward of the Equinoctial Line  The d we set sail for Sierra Leona and on the th day we fell in with the point on the south side of Sierra Leona which Mr Brewer knew very well and went in before with the Content which was Viceadmiral and we had no less than five fathoms water when we had least and had for fourteen leagues in southwest all the way running into the harbour of Sierra Leona sixteen fourteen twelve ten and eight fathoms of water  The th of the said month we put into the harbour and in going in we had by the southmost point at least five fathoms water by the rock which lieth at the said point and after we came within two or three cables length of the said rock we never had less than ten fathoms water until we came up to the road which is about a league from the point bordering always on the southside until you come up to the wateringplace in which bay is the best road but you must ride far into the bay  because there runs prodigious great tides in the offing and it commonly floweth into the road at a southeast and by east moon  It is from England to this place leagues which we ran from the st of July to the th of this month of August On Saturday being the th day there came two negroes from the shore aboard our Admiral and made signs unto our General that there was a Portuguese ship within the harbour so the Hugh Gallant being the Rearadmiral went up three or four leagues but for want of a pilot they went no farther for the harbour runneth up three or four leagues more and is of a prodigious breadth and very dangerous as we were afterwards informed by a Portuguese  On Sunday the th the General sent some of his company on shore and there as they played and danced all the forenoon among the negroes to the end that they might hear some good news of the Portuguese ship and as they were returning to go on board they spied a Portuguese which lay hid among the bushes whom we took and brought away with us the same night and he told us it was very dangerous going up with our boats in search of the ship that was at the town Wherupon we went not to seek her because we knew he told us the truth for we bound him and made him fast and so examined him He told us also that his ship was there cast away and that there were two more of his company among the negroes  The Portuguese's name was Emmanuel and was by his occupation a chalker belonging to the port of Portugal  On Monday morning being the th day our General landed with men or thereabouts and went up to their town where we burnt two or three houses and took what spoil we could which was but little but all the people fled and in our retiring on board in a very little plain at their town's end they shot their arrows at us out of the woods and hurt three or four of our men Their arrows were poisoned but yet none of our men miscarried at that time Their town is very artificially built with mud walls their houses built round with their yards paled in and kept very clean as are their streets These negroes used great obedience to their king as one of our men said which was an hostage for the negroes which came first There were in their town by estimation about one hundred houses  The first of September there went many of our men on shore at the wateringplace and did wash shirts very quietly all the day And the second day they went again and the negroes were in ambush round about the place and the carpenter of the Admiral going into the wood to do some special business espied them by good fortune But the negroes rushed out upon our men so suddenly that in retiring to our boats many of them were hurt among whom Wm Pickman a soldier was shot in the thigh who plucking the arrow out broke it  and left the head behind and he told the chirurgeons that he plucked out all the arrow because he would not have them lance his thigh whereupon the poison wrought so that night that he was prodigiously swolen and the next morning he died the piece of the arrow with the poison being afterwards plucked out of his thigh  The d day of the said month divers of our fleet went up four miles within the harbour with our boat and caught great store of fish and went on shore and took lemons from the trees and coming on board again saw two buffaloes  The th day we departed from Sierra Leona and went out of the harbour and staid one tide three leagues from the point of the mouth of the harbour in six fathoms and it flowed southsouthwest  On Wednesday being the th of the same month we departed for one of the isles of Cape Verd which is ten leagues distant from the point of Sierra Leona and about five o'clock the same night we anchored about two miles off the island in six fathoms water and landed the same night and found plantains only upon the island  The th day one of our boats went out and sounded about the island and they passed through a Sound at the west end of the island where they found five fathoms water round about the island until they came to the very gut of the Sound and then for a cast or two they had but two fathoms water and presently after six fathoms and so deeper and deeper  And at the east end of the island there was a town where negroes resorted at some times as we perceived by their provision  There is no fresh water on all the southside that we could perceive but on the northside three or four very good places of fresh water and all the whole island is a wood save certain little places where the houses stand which are environed round about with plantain trees whereof the fruit is excellent meat This place is subject very much to thunder rain and lightning in this month I think the reason is because the sun is near the Line Equinoctial On Saturday the th we departed from the said island about three o'clock in the afternoon the wind being at the southwest  The last of October running westsouthwest about twentyfour leagues from Cape Frio in Brazil we fell in with a great mountain which had an high round knob on the top of it standing like a tower  The first of November we went in between the island of St Sebastian and the main land carried several things on shore set up a forge and had our casks on shore our cooper made hoops and so we remained there until the d day of the same month in which time we fitted our things built our pinnace and filled our fresh water And while our pinnace was building there came a canoe from the river of Janeiro meaning to go to St Vincent wherein were six naked slaves of the country which did row the canoe and one Portuguese and the  Portuguese knew Christopher Hare Master of the Admiral for that Mr Hare had been at St Vincent in the Minion of London in the year and thinking to have John Whithal the Englishman which dwelleth at St Vincent come unto us which is twenty leagues from this harbour with some others thereby to have had some fresh victuals we suffered the Portuguese to go with a letter unto him who promised to return or send some answer within ten days for that we told him we were merchants and would traffic with them but we never received any answer from him and seeing that he came not according to appointment our business being dispatched we weighed anchor and set sail from St Sebastian on the d of November  The th day of December we fell in with the coast of America in deg and min the land bearing west from us about six leagues off from which place we ran along the shore until we came into deg It is a steep beach all along  The th of December in the afternoon we entered into an harbour where our Admiral went in first wherefore our General named the said harbour Port Desire in which harbour is an island or two where there is a wonderful great store of seals and another island of birds called grey gulls These seals are of a wonderful bigness huge and monstrous of shape and for the fore part of their bodies cannot be compared to any thing better than to a lion their head neck  and forepart of their bodies are full of rough hair their feet are in the manner of a fin and in form like unto a man's hand they breed and cast every month giving their young milk yet continually get they their living in the sea and live altogether upon fish their young are extraordinary good meat and being boiled or roasted are hardly to be known from lamb or mutton The old ones are of such bigness and force that it is as much as four men are able to do to kill one of them with great staves and he must be beaten down with striking on the head of him for his body is of that bigness that four men could never kill him but only on the head for being shot through the body with an harquebuss or a musket yet he will go his way into the sea and never care for it at the present Also the fowls that were there were very good meat and great plenty of them they have burrows in the ground like conies for they cannot fly they have nothing but down upon their pinions they also fish and feed in the sea for their living and breed on shore  This harbour is a very good place to trim ships in and to bring them on ground and grave them in for there ebbeth and floweth much water therefore we graved and trimmed all our ships there  The th of December being Christmaseve a man and a boy of the Rearadmiral went some forty scores from our ships unto a very fair green valley at the foot of a mountain  where was a little pit or well which our men had digged and made some two or three days before to get fresh water for there was none in all the harbour and this was but brackish therefore this man and boy went thither to wash their linen and being in washing at the said well there were great numbers of Indians which were come down and found the said man and boy in washing These Indians being divided on each side of the rocks shot at them with their arrows and hurt them both but they fled presently being about fifty or threescore though our General followed them but with sixteen or twenty men The man was shot quite through the knee the boy into the shoulder either of them having very sore wounds Their arrows are made of little canes and their heads are of a flint stone set into the cane very artificially They are as wild as ever was a buck or any other wild beast for we followed them and they ran from us as we had been the wildest things in the world We took the measure of one of their feet and it was eighteen inches long Their custom is when any of them die to bring him or them to the cliffs by the seaside and upon the top of them they bury them and in their graves are buried with them their bows and arrows and all their jewels which they had in their lifetime which are fine shells that they find by the seaside which they cut and square after an artificial manner and all are laid under their heads The grave is made  with large stones of great length and bigness being set all along full of the dead man's darts which he used when he was living And they colour both their darts and their graves of a red colour which they use in colouring themselves  The th of December we departed out of the port of Desire and went to an island which lieth three leagues to the southward of it where we trimmed our saved penguins with salt for victuals all that and the next day and departed along the coast southwest and bysouth  The st we fell in with a rock which lieth about five leagues from the land much like unto Edistone which lieth off the sound of Plymouth and we sounded and had eight fathoms rocky ground within a mile thereof the rock bearing westsouthwest We went coasting along southsouthwest and found great store of seals This rock standeth in deg min to the southward of the Line  The d day of January we fell in with a very fair white cape which standeth in degrees and had seven fathoms water a league off the land  The d we fell in with another great white cape which standeth in deg min from which cape there runneth a low beach about a league to the southward and this beach reacheth to the opening of the dangerous strait of Magellan which is in divers places five or six  leagues wide and in two several places more narrow Under this cape we anchored and lost an anchor for it was a great storm and lasted three days very dangerous  The th day we put in for the straits  The th day between the mouth of the straits and the narrowest place thereof we took a Spaniard whose name was Hernando who was there with Spaniards more which were all that remained of four hundred left there three years before all the rest being dead with famine And the same day we passed through the narrowest of the straits where the aforesaid Spaniard shewed us the hull of a small bark which we judged to be a bark called the John Thomas one of Drake's fleet It is from the mouth of the straits unto the narrowest of the straits fourteen leagues and the course lieth west and bynorth The mouth of the straits lieth in degrees  From the narrowest of the straits unto Penguin island is ten leagues and lieth westsouthwest somewhat to the southward where we anchored the th day and killed and salted plenty of penguins for victuals  The th day we departed from Penguin island and ran southsouthwest to King Philip's city which the Spaniards had built which town or city had four forts and every fort had in it one cast piece which pieces were buried in the ground the carriages were standing in their places unburied we digged for  them and had them all They had contrived their city very well and seated it in the best place of the straits for wood and water they had built up their churches by themselves they had laws very severe among them for they had erected a gibbet whereon they had done execution on some of their company It seemed unto us that their whole living for a great space was altogether upon muscles and limpets for there was not any thing else to be had except some deer which came out of the mountains down to the fresh rivers to drink These Spaniards came to fortify the straits to the end that no nation should have passage through into the South Sea saving their own only but as it appeared it was not God's will so to have it for during the time that they were there which was two years at the least they could never have any thing to grow or in any ways prosper and on the other side the Indians often preyed upon them until their victuals grew so short their store being spent which they had brought with them out of Spain and having no means to renew the same that they died like dogs in their houses and in their clothes wherein we found some of them still at our coming until that in the end the town being wonderfully tainted with the smell and favour of the dead people the rest which remained alive were driven to bury such things as they had there in their town and so to forsake the town and to go along the seaside to seek their victuals to  preserve them from starving taking nothing with them but every man his harquebuss and his furniture that was able to do it for some of them were not able to carry them for weakness and so lived for the space of a year and more on roots leaves and sometimes a fowl which they might kill with their piece To conclude they set forwards determined to travel towards the river of Plate there being only twentythree persons left alive whereof two were women which were the remainder of four hundred In this place we watered and wooded well and quietly Our General named this town Port Famine it standeth in degrees by observation to the southward  The th day we departed from this place and ran south southwest and from thence southwest unto Cape Froward five leagues westsouthwest which cape is the southermost part of all the straits and standeth in the latitude of degrees From which cape we ran west and by north five leagues and put into a bay or cove on the southside which we called Musclecove because there was great plenty of them we rode therein six days the wind being still westerly  The st day of January we departed from Musclecove and went northwest and bywest ten leagues to a very fair sandy bay on the northside which our General called Elizabethbay and as we rode there that night one of our men died which went in the Hugh Gallant  whose name was Grey a carpenter by his occupation and was buried there in that bay  The d we departed from Elizabethbay in the afternoon and went about two leagues from that place where there was a fresh water river up which our General went with the ship's boat about three miles which river hath very good and pleasant ground about it It is low and champaign soil and we saw no other ground in all the straits but what was craggy rocks and monstrous high hills and mountains In this river are a great many savages which we saw and had conference with them They were meneaters and fed altogether upon raw flesh and other filthy food which people had lately preyed upon some of the Spaniards before spoken of for they had gotten knives and some pieces of rapiers to make darts of They used all the means they could possibly to have enticed us farther up the river on purpose to have betrayed us which being perceived by our General he caused us to shoot at them with our harquebusses whereby we killed many of them So we sailed from this river to the channel of St Jerome which is two leagues off  From the river of St Jerome about three or four leagues we ran west into a cape which is on the northside and from that cape unto the mouth of the straits the course lieth northwest and bywest and northwest between which place and the mouth of the straits to the southward  we lay in harbour until the d of February by reason of contrary winds and most vile and foul weather with such rain and violent stormy winds which came down from the mountains and high hills that they hazarded the best cables and anchors that we had for to hold which if they had failed we had been in great danger to have been cast away or at least to have been famished for during this time which was a full month we fed almost altogether on muscles limpets and birds or such as we could get on shore seeking every day for them as the fowls of the air do where they can find food in continual rainy weather  There is at every one or two miles end an harbour on both sides of the land And there are between the river of St Jerome and the mouth of the straits going into the South Sea about leagues by estimation so that the whole length of the straits is about leagues and the mouth of the said straits standeth nearly in the same height that the entrance standeth in when we pass out of the North Sea which is about deg and min to the southward of the Line  The th day of February we entered into the South Sea and on the south side in going out of the straits is a fair high cape with a low point adjoining to it and on the northside are four or five islands which lie six leagues off the main and much broken and sunken ground about them By noon the same day we had brought  these islands east of us five leagues off the wind being southerly  The first of March a storm took us at north which night the ships lost the company of the Hugh Gallant being in degrees min and leagues from land This storm continued three or four days and for that time we in the Hugh Gallant being separated from the other two ships looked every hour to sink our bark was so leaky and ourselves so fatigued and weakened with freeing it of water that we slept not during three days and three nights  The th of March in the morning the Hugh Gallant came in between the island of St Mary and the Main where she met with the Admiral and the Content who had rid at the island of La Mocha two days which island standeth in south latitude deg at which place some of our men went on shore with the ViceAdmiral's boat where the Indians fought with them with their bows and arrows and were very wary of their calivers These Indians were enemies to the Spaniards and belonged to a great place called Arauco and took us for Spaniards as we afterwards learned  The abovementioned place Arauco is very rich and full of gold mines and yet could it not be subdued at any time by the Spaniards but they always returned with the greatest loss of men for these Indians are quite desperate and careless of their lives living at their own liberty and freedom  The th day aforesaid in the afternoon we weighed anchor and ran under the west side of St Mary's Island where we rid very well in six fathoms water and very fair ground all that night  The th day our General went on shore himself with or men every one with his furniture There came down to us certain Indians with two which were the Chiefs of the island to welcome us on shore thinking we had been Spaniards for it is subdued by them who brought us up to a place where the Spaniards had erected a church with crosses and altars in it and there were about this church two or three storehouses which were full of wheat and barley ready threshed and made up in cades of straw to the quantity of a bushel of corn in every cade The wheat and barley was as fair as clear and every way as good as any we have in England There were also the like cades full of potatoeroots which were very good to eat ready made up in the storehouses for the Spaniards when they should come for their tribute This island also yielded many sorts of fruits hogs and hens These Indians are held in such slavery by their masters that they dare not eat a hen or hog themselves but the Spaniards have made them all in that island christians Thus we filled ourselves here with corn as much as we would have and as many hogs as we had salt to sal  them with and great plenty of hens with  number of bags of potatoeroots and about  dried dogfishes and Guinea wheat which is called maiz And having taken as much as we would yet we left a prodigious great store behind us Our General had the two Chiefs of the island on board our ship and provided great cheer for them and made them merry with wine and they in the end perceiving that we were not Spaniards made signs as near as our General could perceive that if we would go over unto the main land to Arauco there was much gold making us signs that we should have great store of riches But because we could not understand them our General made haste and within two or three days we furnished ourselves and departed  The th day in the morning we departed from this place and ran all that day northnortheast about ten leagues and at night lay with a short sail off and on the coast  The th we ran in eastnortheast with the land and bore in with a place called the Conception where we anchored under an island and departed the next morning without going on land  The th we departed from the Conception and went into a little bay which was sandy where we saw fresh water and cattle but we staid not there  The th day we came into the bay of Quintero which standeth in deg and min  The said day presently after we were come to an anchor in the bay there was a herdsman  that kept cattle lying upon the point of the hill asleep who when he awaked and had espied three ships which were come into the bay before we could get on shore he had mounted a horse which was feeding by and rode his way as fast as ever he was able and our General with thirty shot with him went on shore He had not been on land an hour when there came three horsemen with bright swords towards us so hard as they could ride till within a quarter of a mile of us and then stopt and would come no nearer unto us so our General sent unto them a couple of our men with their shot and Hernando who was the Spaniard that we had taken up at the mouth of the straits But the Spaniards would not suffer our men to come near with their shot but made signs that one of our men should come alone unto them so the said Hernando the Spaniard went unto them and our two men stood not far from them They had some conference and in the end Hernando came back from them and told our General that he had parlied with them for some victuals and they had promised as much as we would have Our General sent him back again with another message and another shot with him and being come near unto them they would not suffer any more than one to approach them whereupon our men let the Spaniard go unto them alone who being at some good distance from them they staid but a small time together before the said Hernando leaped  up behind one of them and rode away with them notwithstanding the damnable oaths which he had made continually to our General never to forsake him but to die on his side before he would be false Our General seeing how he was dealt with filled water all that day with good watch and carried it on board and night being come he determined next day to send into the country to find their town and to have taken the spoil of it and to have fired it if they could have found it  The last of March Captain Havers went up into the country with or men with their shot and furniture with them and we travelled seven or eight miles into the land and as we were marching along we espied a number of herds of cattle of kine and bullocks which were wonderfully wild we saw also great plenty of horses mares and colts which were very wild and unhandled there is also great store of hares and conies and plenty of partridges and other wild fowls The country is very fruitful with fair fresh rivers all along full of wildfowl of all sorts Having travelled so far that we could go no farther for the monstrous high mountains we rested ourselves at a very fair fresh river running in and along fair low meadows at the foot of the mountains where every man drank of the river and refreshed himself Having so done we returned to our ships the likeliest way we thought their town would be so we travelled all the day long not seeing any man but we  met with many wild dogs yet there were two hundred horsemen abroad that same day by means of the Spaniard which they had taken from us the day before who had told them that our force was but small and that we were wonderfully weak and though they did espy us that day yet durst they not give the onset upon us for we marched along in array and observed good order whereby we seemed a greater number than we were until we came unto our ships that night again  The next day being the first of April our men went on shore to fill water at a pit which was a quarter of a mile from the waterside and being early hard at their business were in no readiness mean while there came pouring down from the hills almost two hundred horsemen and before our people could return to the rocks from the wateringplace twelve of them were cut off part killed and part taken prisoners the rest were rescued by our soldiers who came from the rocks to meet with them for though only fifteen of us had any weapons on shore yet we made the enemy retire in the end with the loss of twentyfour of their men after we had skirmished with them an hour  After the loss of these men we rode at anchor and watered in despite of them with good watch and ward until the th of the said month  The th day we departed out of this bay of Quintero and off from the bay there lieth a little island about a league distant whereon there  are great store of penguins and other fowls whereof we took to serve our turns and sailed away north and northbywest for so lieth the coast along this place  The th we came thwart of a place which is called MorroMoreno which standeth in twentythree degrees thirty minutes and is an excellent good harbour and there is an island which maketh it an harbour for a ship may go in at either end of the island Here we went with our General on shore to the number of thirty men and as soon as we had effected our landing the Indians of the place came down from the rocks to meet us with freshwater and wood on their backs They are in great awe of the Spaniards and very simple people living most savagely for they brought us to their dwellings about two miles from the harbour where we saw their women and bedding which is nothing but the skin of some beast laid upon the ground and over them instead of houses is nothing but five or six sticks laid across which stand upon forked sticks stuck in the ground and a few boughs laid over them Their diet is raw fish which stinketh most vilely and when any of them die they bury their bows and arrows with them and all that they have for we opened one of their graves and saw the order of them Their canoes or boats are very artificially made of two skins resembling bladders and are blown full at one end with quills they have two of these bladders blown full which are  sewed together and made fast with a sinew of some wild beast which when they are in the water swell so that they are as tight as may be They go to sea in these boats and catch plenty of fish but they use it in a beastly manner  On the d in the morning we took a small bark which came out of Arica road which we kept and called the George The men forsook it and went hastily away with their boat Our Admiral's pinnace followed the boat and the Hugh Gallant's boat took the bark our Admiral's pinnace could not recover the boat before it got on shore but went along into the road of Arica and laid aboard a great ship of one hundred tons riding in the road right before the town but all the men and goods were gone out of her only the bare ship was left alone They made three or four very fair shots at the pinnace as she was coming in but missed her very narrowly with a minionshot which they had in the fort Whereupon we came into the road with the Admiral and the Hugh Gallant but the Content which was the ViceAdmiral was behind out of sight by means whereof and for want of her boat to land men withal we landed not otherwise if we had been together our General with the company would resolutely have landed to take the town whatsoever should have come of it The cause why the Content staid behind was that she had found about fourteen  leagues to the southward of Arica in a place where the Spaniards had landed a whole ship's lading of botigas of wine of Castile whereof the said Content took into her as many as she could conveniently carry and came after us into the road of Arica the same day By this time we perceived that the town had gathered all their power together and also conveyed all their treasure away and buried it for they had heard of us Now because it was very populous with the aid of one or two neighbouring places our General saw there was no landing without loss of many men wherefore he gave over that enterprize While we rode at anchor they shot at us and our ships shot at them again for every shot two Moreover our pinnace went in close almost to the shore and fetched out another bark which rode there in despite of all their forts though they shot still at the pinnace which they could never hit After these things our General sent a boat on shore with a flag of truce to know if they would redeem their great ship or no but they would not for they had received special commandment from the Viceroy at Lima not to buy any ship or ransom any man upon pain of death Our General did this in hopes to have redeemed some of our men which were taken prisoners on shore by the horsemen at Quintero otherwise he would have made them no offer of parley  The th riding still in the road we spied a sail coming from the southward and our General  sent out his pinnace to meet her with all our boats but the town made such signs from the hill with fires and tokens out of the watchhouse that before our pinnace could get to them they ran the bark on shore two miles to the southward of the town but they had little leisure to carry any thing with them but all the men escaped among whom there were certain friars for we saw them in their friar's weeds as they ran on shore Many horsemen came from the town to rescue them and to carry them away otherwise we had landed and taken or killed them so we went on board the bark as she lay sunk and fetched out the pillage but there was nothing in it of any value and we came on board our ships again the same night and the next morning we set the great ship on fire in the road and sunk one of the barks carrying the other along with us and so departed from thence and went away northwest  The th we took a small bark which came from St Jago near unto Quintero where we lost our men first In this bark was one George a Greek an intelligent pilot for all the coast of Chili They were sent to the city of Lima with letters of advice of us and of the loss of our men there were also in the said bark one Fleming and three Spaniards and they were all sworn and received the sacrament before they came to sea by three or four friars that if we should chance to meet them they should throw those letters overboard which as we were giving  them chace with our pinnace before we could reach them they had accordingly thrown away Yet our General wrought so with them that they did confess their errand but he was fain to cause them to be tormented with their thumbs in a winch and to repeat it several times with extreme pain also he made the old Fleming believe that he would hang him and the rope being about his neck he was pulled up a little from the hatches and yet he would not confess chusing rather to die than he would be perjured  The d of May we came into a bay where are three little towns which are called Paracca Chincha and Pisca where some of us landed and took certain houses wherein was bread wine figs and hens but the sea went so high that we could not land at the best of the towns without sinking of our boats and great hazard of us all This place standeth in thirteen degrees and forty minutes to the southward of the Line  The th of May we departed from this harbour leaving the Content our ViceAdmiral at the island of Seals by which means at that time we lost her company  The th we gave chace to a sail but we could not reach it  The th day the Hugh Gallant in which bark I Francis Pretie was lost company of our Admiral  The th we who were in the Hugh Gallant put into a bay which standeth in twelve degrees  forty minutes in which bay we found a river of fresh water about eight o'clock at night and though we were but of small force no more than one bark and eighteen men in it yet we went on shore to fill water where having filled one boat's lading while our crew were going on board two or three of our company which were on shore as they were going a little from the wateringplace with their furniture about them spied where there were four or five hundred bags of meal on an heap covered with a few reeds so that night we filled water and took as much meal as we thought good which fell out well for us who were then lost and stood in need of victuals and by break of day in the morning we came on board and there staid and rode until the afternoon in which time the town seeing us ride there still brought down much cattle to the sea side to have enticed us to come on shore but we saw their intent and weighed anchor and departed the th day  The th day at night we put into a bay which standeth in nine degrees twenty minutes where we saw horsemen And that night we landed namely Mr Bruer captain myself Arthur Warford John Way preacher John Newman Andrew Wight William Gargefield and Henry Hilliard and we eight only having every man his harquebuss and his furniture about him marched three quarters of a mile along the seaside where we found a boat  of five or six tons hauled up dry on the shore about a cable's length from the water and with extreme labour we launched the bark When it was on float Captain Bruer and I went in while the rest were fetching their things but suddenly it was ready to sink and the Captain and I stood up to the knees laving out the water with our targets but it sunk down faster than we were able to free it insomuch that in the end we had much ado to save ourselves from drowning When we were out we stood in great fear that our own boat wherein we came on shore was sunk for we could no where see it Howbeit the Captain commanded them to keep it off for fear of the great surge that went by the shore yet in the end we spied it and went on board by two and two and were forced to wade up to the armpits sixty paces into the sea before we could get into the boat by reason of the shoalness and then departed the fourteenth day in the morning  The th we took with the Hugh Gallant being but sixteen men of us in it a large ship which came from Guaianil which was called the Lewis and was of the burthen of three hundred tons having twentyfour men in it wherein was a pilot one Gonsalvo de Ribas whom we carried along with us and a negroe called Emmanuel The ship was laden with nothing but timber and victuals wherefore we left her seven or eight leagues from the land very  leaky and ready to sink we sunk her boat and took away her foresail and some provisions  The th of May we met with our Admiral again and all the rest of our fleet they had taken two ships the one laden with sugar melasses maize skins many packs of pintadoes some marmalade and a thousand hens The other ship was laden with wheatmeal and boxes of marmalade One of these ships which had the chief merchandize in it was worth twenty thousand pounds if it had been in England or in any other part of Christendom where we might have sold it We filled all our ships with as much as we could of these goods the rest we burnt and the ships also and set the men and women that were not killed on shore  The th day in the morning we came into the road of Paita and being at an anchor our General landed with sixty or seventy men skirmished with some of the town and drove them all to flight to the top of the hill which is over the town except a few slaves and some others who were of the meaner sort who were commanded by the Governor to stay below in the town at a place which was building for a fort having with them a bloody ensign being in number about an hundred men Now as we were rowing between the ships and the shore our gunner shot off a great piece out of one of the barks and the shot fell among them and made them to fly from the fort as fast as they could run but having got up upon the hill  Cavendish plunders burns Paita  they in their cum shot among us with their smallshot After we were landed and had taken the town we ran upon them and chaced them so fiercely for the space of an hour that we drove them in the end away by force and being got up the hills we found where they had hid what they had brought out of the town We also found the quantity of twentyfive pounds weight of silver in pieces of eight and abundance of houshold stuff and storehouses full of all kinds of wares But our General would not suffer the men to carry much cloth or apparel away because they should not clog themselves with burdens for he knew not whether our enemies were provided with firearms according to the number of their men for they were five men to one of us and we had an English mile and an half to our ships Being come down in safety to the town which was very well built and kept very clean in every street with a townhouse or guildhall in the midst of it and had to the number of two or three hundred houses at least in it we set it on fire and burnt it to the ground and goods to the value of five or six thousand pounds There was also a bark riding at anchor in the road which we set on fire and departed directing our course to the island of Puna  The th of May we arrived at the island of Puna where is a very good harbour There we found a great ship of tons riding at anchor with all her furniture which was ready to  be hauled on ground for there is a special good place for that purpose We sunk it and went on shore where the Lord of the island dwelt who had a sumptuous dwelling which was by the water side exceedingly well contrived with many very singular good rooms and chambers in it and out of every chamber was framed a gallery with a stately prospect towards the sea on one side and into the island on the other side with a magnificent hall below and a very great storehouse at one end of the hall which was filled with botigas of pitch and bast to make cables with for the most part of the cables in the South Sea are made upon that island This great Casique obliged all the Indians on the island to work and trudge for him he is an Indian born but is married to a beautiful woman who is a Spaniard by reason of his pleasant habitation and his great wealth  This Spanish woman his wife is honoured as a Queen in the island and never walketh upon the ground on foot but accounteth it too base a thing for her but when her pleasure is to take the air or to go abroad she is always carried in a sedan upon four men's shoulders with a veil or canopy over her to shade her from the sun or the wind having her gentlewoman still attending about her with a great troop of the best men in the island with her But both she and the lord of the island with all the Indians in the town were nearly fled out of the island before we could get to an anchor by reason we  were becalmed before we could get in and were gone over unto the main land having carried with them crowns which we knew by a Captain of the island an Indian whom we had taken at sea as we were coming into the road being in a balsa or a canoe for a spy to see what we were  The th our General himself with certain shot and some targetliers went over to the main unto the place where this Indian Captain told us the Casique who was Lord of all the island was gone unto and had carried all his treasure with him but at our coming to the place where we went to land we found newly arrived there four or five great balsas laden with plantains bags of meal and many other kinds of victuals Our General marvelled what they were and what they meant asking the Indian guide and commanding him to speak the truth upon his life Being then bound fast he answered being very much abashed as well as our company were that he neither knew from whence they should come nor who they should be for never a man was in either of the balsas yet he had told our General before that it was an easy matter to take the said Casique and all his treasure and that there were but three or four houses standing in a desart place and no resistance and that if he found it not so he might hang him Again being demanded to speak upon his life what he thought these balsas should be he answered that he  could not say what they were nor from whence they should come except it was to carry sixty soldiers who he did hear were to go to a place called Guaiaquil which was about six leagues from the said island where two or three of the King's ships were on the stocks in building and where there were continually an hundred soldiers in garrison who had heard of us and had sent for sixty more for fear of burning of the ships and town Our General not any whit discouraged either at the sight of the balsas unlooked for or at hearing of the sixty soldiers not until then spoken of bravely animated his company to the exploit went presently forward being in the night in a most desart path through the woods until he came to the place where as it seemed they had kept watch either at the waterside or at the houses or at both and were newly gone out of the houses having so short warning that they left the meat both boiling and roasting at the fire and were fled with their treasure with them or else buried it where it could not be sound Our company took hens and such things as we thought good and came away  The th our General went in the ship's boat unto a little island adjoining whither the Casique who was Lord of Rena had caused all the hangings of his chambers which were Cordovan leather all gilded over and painted very fair and rich with all his houshold stuff and all the ship's tackling which were riding in the road at our coming in with great store of nails spikes  of iron and very many other things to be conveyed all which we found and brought away what our General thought requisite for the ships  This island is very pleasant for all the delights of life and fruitful but there are no mines of gold or silver in it There are at least houses in the town about the Casique's palace and as many in one or two towns more upon the island which is almost as big as the Isle of Wight in England There is planted on the one side of the Casique's house a fair garden with all herbs growing in it and at the lower end a well of fresh water and round about it are trees set whereon bombazine cotton groweth after this manner The tops of the trees grow full of cods out of which the cotton groweth and in the cotton is a seed of the bigness of a pea and in every cod there are seven or eight of these seeds and if the cotton be not gathered when it is ripe then these seeds fall from it and spring again  There are also in this garden fig trees which bear continually also pompions melons cucumbers raddishes rosemary and thyme with many other herbs and roots At the other end of the house there is also another orchard where grow oranges sweet and sour lemons pomegranates and limes with divers other fruits There is very good pasture ground in this island and there are many horses oxen bullocks sheep very fat and fair a great many goats which are very tame and are used continually to be milked  They have also abundance of pigeons turkies and ducks of prodigious bigness  There was also a very large and great church near to the Casique's house whither he caused all the Indians in the island to come and hear mass for he himself was made a christian when married to the Spanish woman before spoken of and upon his conversion he caused the rest of his subjects to be christened In this church was an high altar with a crucifix and five bells hanging in one end thereof We burnt the church and brought the bells away  By this time we had hauled on ground our Admiral and made her clean burnt her keel pitched and tarred her and had hauled her on float again and in the mean time kept watch in the great house both night and day  The d of June in the morning by daybreak every one of the watch having gone abroad to seek provisions some one way and some another some for hens some for sheep some for goats upon a sudden there came down upon us an hundred soldiers with musquets and an ensign which were landed on the other side of the island that night and all the Indians of the island along with them every one with weapons and their baggage after them which happened by means of a negroe whose name was Emmanuel who fled from us at our first landing there Thus being taken at a disadvantage we had the worst for our company did not exceed sixteen or twenty whereof they  had slain one or two before they were come to the houses yet we skirmished with them an hour and a half At last being greatly overcharged with multitudes we were driven down from the hill to the waterside and there we kept them in play a while until in the end our halberdier who had kept the way of the hill and had slain a couple of them as he breathed himself had an honourable death for a shot struck him to the heart who feeling himself mortally wounded cried to God for mercy and fell down dead But soon after the enemy was driven back from the bank side to the green and in the end our boat came and carried as many of our men as could go in her without hazard of sinking but one of our men was shot through the head with his own piece being a snaphand as he was getting into the boat Four of us were left behind which the boat could not carry of whom myself was one who had our shot ready and retired into a cliff until the boat came again which was presently after they had carried the rest on board There were fortysix of the enemy slain by us whereof they dragged some into bushes and some into old houses which we found afterwards We lost only of our men  The same day we went on shore again with men and had a fresh skirmish with the enemy and made them retire This done we set fire to the town and burnt it to the ground and shortly after made havock of their fields  orchards and gardens and burnt four great ships more which were building on the stocks  The d of June the Content which was our ViceAdmiral was hauled on ground to grave at the same place in spite of the Spaniards and also our pinnace was new trimmed  The th we departed out of the road of Puna where we remained eleven days and turned up to a place which is called Rio Dolce where we watered at which place also we sunk our RearAdmiral called the Hugh Gallant for want of men being a bark of tons  The th we set the Indians on shore which we had taken before as we were coming into the road of Puna  The th we departed from Rio Dolce  The th we doubled the Equinoctial Line and continued our course northwards all that month  The st of July we had sight of the coast of Nueva Espanna being four leagues distant from land in the latitude of degrees to the northward of the Line  The th we took a new ship of tons burthen wherein was one Michael Sancius whom our General took to serve his turn to water along the coast for he was one of the best coasters in the South Sea This Michael Sancius was a provincial born in Marseilles and was the first man that told us news of the great ship called the Santa Anna which we afterwards took coming from the Philippines  There were six men more in this new ship We took her sails ropes and firewood to serve our turns set her on fire and kept the men  The th we took another bark which was going with advice of us and our ships all along the coast as Michael Sancius told us but all company that were in the bark were fled on shore Neither of these ships had any goods in them for they came both from Sonsonate in the province of Guatimala the new ship for fear we should have taken her in the road and the bark to carry news along the coast which bark we also set on fire  The th we came to anchor in ten fathoms in the river of Copalita where we intended to water and that same night we departed with thirtytwo men in the pinnace and rowed to Aguatulco which is but two leagues from the aforesaid river and standeth in deg min to the northward of the Equinoctial Line  The th day in the morning by break of day we came into the road of Aguatulco where we found a bark of tons which was come from Sonsonate laden with cocoas and anil which they had there landed and the men were all sled on shore We landed there and burnt the town with the church and customhouse which was very fair and large in which house were bags of anil to dye cloth every bag whereof was worth crowns and bags of cocoas every bag whereof is worth crowns These cocoas go among them for meat and  money for of them are in value one rial of plate in ready payment They are very like an almond but are not so pleasant in taste They eat them and make drink of them this the owner of the ship told us I found in this town before we burnt it a flasket full of boxes of balm After we had spoiled and burned the town wherein there were some hundred houses the owner of the ship came down out of the hills with a flag of truce unto us who before with all the rest of the townsmen run away and at length came on board our pinnace upon Captain Havers' word of safe return We carried him to the river of Copalita where out ships rode When we came to our General he caused him to be set on shore in safety the same night because he came upon the Captain's word  The th we set sail from Copalita because the sea was so great that we could not fill water and ran the same night into the road of Aguatulco  The th our General landed and took with him thirty men two miles into the woods where we took a Mestizo whose name was Michael de Truxillo who was customer of that town and we found with him two chambers full of his stuff we brought him and his stuff on board and whereas I say he was a Mestizo it is to be understood that a Mestizo is one who hath a Spaniard to his father and an Indian to his mother  The d day of August having watered and examined the said Mestizo and set him on shore again we departed from the port of Aguatulco the same night which standeth as I said before in deg and min to the northward of the Line Here we overslipped the haven of Acapulco from whence the ships are fitted out for the Philippines  The th our General with thirty of us went with the pinnace to an haven called Puerto de Natividad where we had intelligence by Michael Sancius that there should be a pinnace but before we could get thither the said pinnace was gone to fish for pearls twelve leaves farther as we were informed by certain Indians whom we found there We took a mullatto in this place in his bed who was sent with letters of advice concerning us along the coast of Nueva Galicia whose horse we killed We took his letters left him behind set fire to the houses and burnt two new ships of tons each which were building there on the stocks and came on board of our ships again  The th we came into the bay of St Jago where we watered at a fresh river along which river many plantains were growing Here is abundance of fresh fish here also some of our company dragged for pearls and caught some quantity  The d of September we departed from St Jago at four o'clock in the evening The bay of St Jago standeth in nineteen degrees  and eighteen minutes to the northward of the Line  The d we arrived in a little bay a league to the westward of Port de Natividad called Malacca which is a very good place to ride in and this day about twelve o'clock our General landed with thirty men and went up to a town of Indians which was two leagues from the road which town is called Acatlan there were in it about or houses and a church which we defaced and came on board the same night All the people fled out of the town at the sight of us  The th we departed from the road of Malacca and sailed along the coast The th we came to the road of Chacalla in which bay there are two little houses by the waterside This bay is leagues from the Cape de los Corientes  The th in the morning our General sent up Captain Havers with forty men of us before day and Michael Sancius being our guide we went unto a place about two leagues up into the country in a most obscure desart path through the woods and wilderness and in the end we came to a place where we took three housholders with their wives and children and some Indians one carpenter who was a Spaniard and a Portuguese We bound them all and made them come to the seaside with us our General made their wives fetch us plantains lemons oranges pineapples and other fruits whereof they had  abundance and so let their husbands depart except Sembrano the Spanish carpenter and Diego the Portuguese and the tenth day we departed from the road  The th we arrived at a little island called the isle of St Andrew on which there is great store of fowl and wood where we dried and salted as many of the fowls as we thought good We also killed there abundance of seals and oguanos which are a kind of serpents with four feet and a long sharp tail strange to them who have not seen them but they are very good meat We rode here until the th at which time we departed  The th we arrived in the road of Massatlan in twentythree degrees thirty minutes just under the Tropic of Cancer It is a very great river within but is barred at the mouth and upon the north side of the bar without is good fresh water but there is much difficulty in filling it because at low water it is shoal half a mile off the shore There is great store of fresh fish in this bay and good fruits up in the country whereof we had some though not without danger  The th we departed from the road of Massatlan and ran to an island which is a league to the northward of the said Massatlan where we trimmed our ships and newbuilt our pinnace There is a little island a quarter of a league from it on which are seals where a Spanish prisoner whose name was Domingo being sent to  wash shirts with one of our men to keep him made his escape and swam to the main which was an English mile distant at which place we had seen thirty or forty Spaniards and Indians who were horsemen and kept watch there and came from a town called Chiametla which was eleven leagues up into the country as Michael Sancius told us We found upon the island where we trimmed our pinnace fresh water by digging two or three feet deep into the sand where no water nor sign of water was before to be perceived otherwise we must have gone back or leagues to water which might have occasioned our missing the prey we had long waited for but one Flores a Spaniard who was also a prisoner with us made a motion to dig in the sands Now our General having had experience before of the like commanded to put his motion in practice and digging three feet deep we found very good and fresh water so we watered our ships and might have filled a thousand tons more if we had pleased  We staid in this island until the ninth day of October and then departed at night for the Cape of St Lucar which is on the west side of the point of California  The th we fell in with the Cape of St Lucar which cape is very like the Needles at the Isle of Wight and within the said cape is a great bay called by the Spaniards Aguada Segura into which bay falleth a fair fresh river about which many Indians use to keep We  watered in the river and lay off and on with the said cape of St Lucar until the th of November and had the winds hanging still westerly  The th of November beating up and down upon the headland of California in degrees minutes to the northward between seven and eight o'clock in the morning one of the company of our Admiral who was the trumpeter of the ship going up unto the top espied a sail bearing in from the sea with the cape whereupon he cried with no small joy to himself and all the company A sail a sail With which chearful word the Master of the ship and divers others of the company went also up to the maintop who perceiving his speech to be very true gave information unto our General of this happy news who was no less glad than the cause required whereupon he gave in charge presently unto the whole company to put all things in readiness which being performed he gave them chace for three or four hours standing with our best advantage and working for the wind In the afternoon we got up to them giving them a broadside with our great ordnance and a volley of small shot and presently laid the ship aboard whereof the King of Spain was owner which was Admiral of the South Sea called St Anna and thought to be seven hundred tons in burthen Now as we were ready on the ship's side to enter her there not being above fifty or sixty men at most in  our ship we perceived that the Captain of the Santa Anna had made sights fore and aft and laid their sails close on their poop their midship with their forecastle and not one man to be seen they standing so close under their sights with lances javelins rapiers targets and an innumerable quantity of large stones which they threw overboard upon our heads and into our ships so fast and being so many of them that they put us off the ship again with the loss of two of our men who were slain and four or five wounded But for all this we new trimmed our sails and fitted every man his furniture and gave them a fresh encounter with our great ordnance and also with our small shot raking them through and through to the killing and wounding of many of their men Their Captain still like a valiant man with his company stood very stoutly unto his close fights not yielding as yet Our General encouraging his men afresh with the whole noise of trumpets gave them the other encounter with our great ordnance and all our small shot to the great discouragement of our enemies raking them through in divers places killing and wounding many of their men They being thus discouraged and spoiled and their ship being in hazard of sinking by reason of the great shot which were made whereof some were under water after five or six hours fight set out a flag of truce and parlied for mercy desiring our General to save their lives and to take their  goods and that they would presently yield Our General promised them mercy and willed them to strike their sails and to hoist out their boat and to come on board which news they were full glad to hear and presently struck their sails hoisted out their boat and one of their chief merchants came on board unto our General and falling down upon his knees offered to have kissed our General's feet and craved mercy Our General pardoned both him and the rest upon promise of their true dealing with him and his company concerning such riches as were in the ship and sent for their Captain and pilot who at their coming used the like duty and reverence as the former did Our General promised their lives and good usage The said Captain and pilot presently certified the General what goods they had on board viz pezoes of gold and the rest of the riches that the ship was laden with were silks sattins damasks with musk and divers other merchandize and great plenty of all manner of provisions with the choice of many conserves and several sorts of very good wines These things being made known to the General by the aforesaid Captain and pilot they were commanded to stay on board the Desire and on the th day of November following we went into an harbour which is called by the Spaniards Aguada Segura or Puerto Seguro  Here the whole company of Spaniards both men and women to the number of persons were set on shore where they had a fair river  of fresh water with great plenty of fresh fish fowl and wood and also many hares and conies upon the main land Our General also gave them plenty of provisions garvances peason and some wine Also they had all the sails of their ship to make them tents on shore with licence to take such store of planks as should be sufficient to make them a bark Then we fell to heaving in of our goods sharing of the treasure and allotting to every man his portion in division whereof the th of this month many of the company fell into a mutiny against our General especially those who were in the Content which were nevertheless pacified for the time  On the th day of November which is the day of the happy coronation of her Majesty our General commanded all his ordnance to be shot off with the small shot both in his own ship and in the Content which was our ViceAdmiral This being done the same night we had many fireworks and more ordnance discharged to the great admiration of all the Spaniards who were there for the most of them had never seen the like before  This ended our General discharged the Captain and gave him a royal reward with provision for his own and company's defence against the Indians both of swords targets pieces shot and powder to his great contentment But before his departure he took out of this great ship two young lads born in Japan who could both read  and write their own language the eldest being about twenty years old was named Christopher the other was called Cosmus about seventeen years of age both of very good capacity He took also with him out of their ship three boys born in the isles of Manilla the one about fifteen the other about thirteen the youngest about nine years of age the name of the eldest was Alphonso the second Anthony de Dasi the third remaineth with the Right Honourable the Countess of Essex He also took from them one Nicholas Roderigo a Portuguese who had not only been in Canton and other parts of China but had also been in the islands of Japan being a country most rich in silver mines and had also been in the Philippines He took also from them a Spaniard whose name was Thomas de Ersola who was a very good pilot from Acapulco and the coast of Nueva Espanna unto the islands of Ladrones where the Spaniards put in to water sailing between Acapulco and the Philippines in which isles of Ladrones they found freshwater plantains and potatoe roots howbeit the people are very rude and heathens  The th day of November aforesaid about three o'clok in the afternoon our General caused the King's ship to be set on fire which having to the quantity of tons of goods in her we saw burnt unto the water and then gave them a piece of ordnance and set sail joyfully homewards towards England with a fair wind  which by this time was come about to eastnortheast and night growing near we left the Content a stern of us which was not as yet come out of the road and here thinking she would have overtaken us we lost her company and never saw her after  We were sailing from this haven of Aguada Segura in California unto the isles of Ladrones the rest of November and all December and so forth until the d of January with a fair wind for the space of fortyfive days and we esteemed it to be between seventeen and eighteen hundred leagues  The d of January by six o'clock in the morning we had sight of one of the islands of Ladrones called the island of Guarsa standing in deg min towards the north and sailing with a gentle gale before the wind by one or two o'clock in the afternoon we were come within two leagues of the island where we met with sixty or seventy sail of canoes full of savages who came off to sea unto us and brought with them in their canoes plantains cocoas potatoeroots and fresh fish which they had caught at sea and held them up unto us for to truck or exchange with us which when we perceived we made fast little pieces of old iron upon small cords and fishing lines and so veered the iron into their canoes and they caught hold of them and took off the iron and in exchange of it they would make fast unto the line either a potatoeroot or a bundle of plantains which  we hauled in and thus our company exchanged with them until they had satisfied themselves with as much as did content them yet we could not be rid of them for afterwards they were so thick about the ship that it stemmed and broke one or two of their canoes but the men saved themselves being in every canoe four six or eight persons all naked and excellent swimmers and divers They are of a tawny colour marvellously fat and ordinarily bigger of stature than the most of our men in England wearing their hair very long yet some of them have it made up and tied with a knot on the crown and some with two knots much like unto their images which we saw them have carved in wood and standing in the head of their boats like unto the images of the devil Their canoes were as artificially made as any that ever we had seen considering they were made and contrived without any edged tool they are not above half a fathom in breadth and in length some seven or eight fathoms and their heads and sterns are both alike they are made out with rafts of canes and reeds on the starboardside with mast and sail their sail is made of mats of sedges square or triangle ways and they sail as well right against the wind as before it These savages followed us so long that we could not be rid of them until in the end our General commanded our harquebusses to be made ready and he himself fired one of them and the rest shot at them but they were so nimble that we could  not discern whether they were killed or not because they could fall backward into the sea and prevent us by diving  The th by break of day we fell in with an headland of the Philippines which is called Cabo del Spirito Santo which is of very great bigness and length high land in the midst of it and very low land as the cape lieth east and west trending far into the sea to the westward This cape or island is distant from the isle of Guana leagues We were in sailing of this course eleven days with scant winds and foul weather bearing no sail two or three nights This island standeth in thirteen degrees and is inhabited for the most part by heathens and very woody through the whole island It is short of the chiefest island of the Philippines called Manilla about sixty leagues Manilla is well planted and inhabited by Spaniards to the number of six or seven hundred persons who dwell in a town unwalled which hath three or four small blockhouses part made of wood and part of stone being indeed of no great strength They have one or two small gallies belonging to the town It is a very rich place in gold and many other commodities and they have yearly traffic from Acapulco in Nueva Espanna and also twenty or thirty ships from China and from the Sanguelos which bringeth them many sorts of merchandize The merchants of China and the Sanguelos are part Moors and part heathens they bring great quantities of gold with them  which they traffic and exchange for silver and give weight for weight These Sanguelos are men of great genius for inventing and making all manner of things especially in all handicrafts and sciences and every one is so expert perfect and skilful in his faculty that few or no Christians are able to go beyond them in that which they take in hand For drawing and embroidering upon sattin silk or lawn either beast fowl fish or worm for liveliness and perfectness both in silk silver gold and pearl they excel  The th at night we entered the straits between the island of Lucon and the island of Camlaia  The th day we fell in with an island called Capul and had betwixt that and another island a very narrow passage occasioned by a ledge of rocks lying off the point of the island of Capul and no danger but water enough a good way off Within the point there is a fine bay and a very good harbour in four fathoms water within a cable's length of the shore Our ship was no sooner come to an anchor than presently there came a canoe rowing on board us in which was one of the chief Casiques of the island whereof there are seven who supposing that we were Spaniards brought us potatoeroots which they call camotas and green cocoas in exchange for which we gave his company linnen to the quantity of a yard for four cocoas and as much linnen for a basket of potatoeroots  of a quart in quantity which roots are very good eating and very sweet either roasted or boiled  This Casique's skin was carved and cut with various coloured strakes and devices all over his body we kept him still on board and caused him to send those men who brought him on board back to the island to invite the rest of the principal men to come on board who were no sooner gone on shore than presently the people of the island came down with their cocoas and potatoeroots and the rest of the Casiques likewise came on board and brought with them hens and hogs They used the same order with us which they do with the Spaniards for they took for every hog which they call balboye eight rials of plate and for every hen or cock one rial of plate Thus we rode at anchor all that day doing nothing but buying roots cocoas hens hogs and such things as they brought refreshing ourselves very much  The same day at night Nicholas Roderigo the Portuguese whom we had taken out of the great Santa Anna at the Cape of California desired to speak with our General in secret which when our General understood he sent for him and asked him what he had to say to him The Portuguese made him answer That altho' he had offended his worship heretofore yet now he had vowed his faith and true service to him and in respect whereof he neither could nor would conceal such treason as was plotting  against him and his company which was this that the Spaniard who was taken out of the great Santa Anna for a pilot whose name was Thomas de Ersola had written a letter secretly sealed it and locked it up in his chest meaning to convey it by the inhabitants of this island to Manilla the contents whereof were that there had been two English ships along the coast of Chili Peru Nueva Espanna and Nueva Galicia and that they had taken many ships and merchandize in them and burnt divers towns and spoiled all that ever they could come unto and that they had taken the king's ship which came from Manilla and all his treasure and all the merchandize that was therein and had set all the people on shore taking himself away by force therefore he willed them that they should make strong their bulwarks with their two galleys and all such provision as they could possibly make He further signified that we were riding at an island called Capul which was at the end of the island of Manilla being but one ship with small force in it and that the other ship as he supposed was gone for the northwest passage standing in fiftyfive degrees and that if they could use any means to surprize us being there at anchor they should dispatch it for our force was but small and our men but weak and that the place where we rode was but fifty leagues from them otherwise if they let us escape within a few years they must make account to have their  town besieged and sacked by an army of English This information being given our General called for him and charged him with these things which at the first he utterly denied but in the end the matter being made manifest and known of certainty by special trial and proofs the next morning our General gave orders that he should be hanged which was accordingly performed the th of January  We rode for the space of nine days about this island of Capul where we had divers kinds of fresh victuals with excellent fresh water in every bay and great plenty of wood The people of this island go almost naked and are of a tawny colour The men wear only a girdle about their waists of a kind of linnen of their own weaving which is made of plantain leaves and an apron which coming from their back and covering their nakedness is made fast to their girdles at their navels  These people use a strange kind of order among them which is this every man and manchild among them hath a little pegnail thrust through the head of his privy parts being split in the lower end and rivetted and on the head of the nail is as it were a crown which they take out and in as they have occasion and for the truth thereof we ourselves have taken one of these nails from a son of one or their kings who was of the age of ten years  On the d of January our General Mr Thomas Cavendish caused all the chiefs of this island and of an hundred islands more whom he had made to pay tribute to him which tribute was in hogs hens potatoes and cocoas to appear before him and made himself and his company known unto them that they were Englishmen and enemies to the Spaniards and thereupon spread his ensign sounded his trumpets and beat his drums which they much wondered at To conclude they promised both themselves and all the islands thereabout to aid him whensoever he should come again to overcome the Spaniards Also our General gave them in token that we were enemies to the Spaniards money back again for all their tribute which they had paid which they took very friendly and rowed about our ship to give us pleasure At last our General ordered a sacre to be shot off whereat they wondered and with great contentment took their leave of us  The next day being the th of January we set sail about six o'clock in the morning and ran along the coast of the island of Manilla shaping our course north west between Manilla and the isle of Masbat  The th in the morning about seven o'clock riding at an anchor between two islands we spied a frigate under her courses coming out between two other islands which as we imagined came from Manilla sailing close by the shore along the main island of Panama We chaced this frigate along the shore and gained fast upon her  until in the end we came so near that she stood in for the shore close by a wind and being becalmed banked up with her oars whereupon we came to an anchor with our ship a league and a half from the place where the frigate rowed in and manned our boat with half a dozen shot and as many men with swords who did row the boat Thus we made after the frigate which had run into a river where we could not reach her but as we rowed along the shore our boat came into very shallow water where many marks were set up in divers places in the sea from whence two or three canoes came forth whereof one made somewhat near unto us with three or four Indians in it We called unto them but they would not come nearer unto us but rowed from us whom we durst not follow too far for fear of bringing ourselves too much to the leeward of our ship Here as we looked about us we spied another balsa or canoe of a great bigness which they who were in her did set along as we usually set a barge with long staves or poles which was builded up with great canes and below near the water made to row with oars wherein were about five or six Indians and one Spaniard Now as we were come almost at the balsa we ran aground with our boat but one or two of our men leapt overboard and freed it again presently and keeping thwart her head we laid her aboard and took into us the Spaniard but the Indians leaped into the sea and dived and rose again far off from us Presently upon the taking of this canoe  e  appeared upon the sands a band of soldiers marching with an ensign having a red cross like the flag of England who were about fifty or sixty Spaniards lately come from Manilla to that town which is called Reguan in a bark to fetch a new ship of the king's which was building in a river within the bay and staid there only for certain irons to serve for the rudder of the said ship which they looked for every day  This band of men shot at us from the shore with their musquets but hit none of us and we shot at them again They also manned a frigate and sent it out after our boat to have taken us but we with our oars went from them and whether they perceived they could not overtake us but that they must come within danger of the ordnance of our ship they stood in with the shore again and landed their men and presently sent their frigate about the point but whither we knew not so we came on board with this one Spaniard who was neither soldier nor sailor but one who was come among the rest from Manilla and had been in the hospital there a long time before and was a very simple fellow and such a one as could answer to very little that was enquired of him concerning the state of the country Here we rode at anchor all that night and perceived that the Spaniards had dispersed their band into two or three parties and kept great watch in several places with fires and shooting off of their pieces  This island hath much plain ground in it in many places and many fair and straight trees grow upon it fit to make excellent masts for all sorts of ships There are also mines of very fine gold in it which are in the custody of the Indians And to the southward of this place there is another very great island which is not subdued by the Spaniards nor any other nation The people who inhabit it are all negroes and the island is called the Island of Negroes It is almost as big as England standing in nine degrees The most part of it seemeth to be very low land and by all likelihood is very fruitful  The th day of January about six o'clock in the morning we set sail sending our boat before until it was two o'clock in the afternoon passing all this time as it were through a strait betwixt the said two islands of Panama and the island of Negroes and about leagues off we espied a fair opening trending southwest and by south at which time our boat came on board and our General sent commendations to the Spanish Captain whom we came from the evening before by the Spaniard we had taken and desired him to provide good store of gold for he intended to see him with his company at Manilla within a few years and that he did but want a bigger boat to have landed his men or else he would have seen him then and so caused him to be set on shore  The th day of February by eight o'clock in the morning we espied an island near Gilolo  called Batochina which standeth in one degree from the Equinoctial Line northward  The th day of February we fell in with eleven or twelve very small islands lying very low and flat full of trees and passed by some islands which are sunk and have the dry sands lying in the main sea These islands near the Moluccas stand in three degrees ten minutes to the southward of the Line  On the th day one John Gameford a cooper died who had been sick of an old disease a long time  The th day we fell in with certain other islands which had many small islands among them standing four degrees to the southward of the Line  On the st day of February being AshWednesday Captain Havers died of a most violent and pestilent ague which held him furiously for seven or eight days to the no small grief of our General and of all the rest of the company who caused two falcons and one sacre to be shot off with all the small shot in the ship who after he was shrouded in a sheet was thrown overboard with great lamentation of us all Moreover presently after his death myself with divers others in the ship fell very sick and so continued in very great pain for the space of three weeks or a month by reason of the extreme heat and intemperateness of the climate  The st day of March having passed through the straits of Java Minor and Java Major we  came to an anchor under the southwest parts of Java Major where we espied certain of the inhabitants who were fishing by the seaside in a bay which was under the island Then our General taking into the shipboat certain of his company and a negroe who could speak the Morisco tongue whom he had taken out of the Santa Anna made towards those fishers who having espied our boat ran on shore into the woods for fear of our men But our General caused his negroe to call unto them who had no sooner heard him call than presently one of them came to the shore side and made answer Our General by the negroe enquired of him for fresh water which they found and caused the fisher to go to the King and to acquaint him of a ship that was come to have traffic for victuals and for diamonds pearls or any other rich jewels that he had for which he should have either gold or other merchandize in exchange The fisher answered that we should have all manner of victuals that we would request Thus our boat came on board again Within a while after we went about to furnish our ship thoroughly with wood and water  About the th of March two or three canoes came from the town unto us with eggs hens fresh fish oranges and limes and brought word we should have had victuals more plentifully but that they were so far to be brought to us where we rode Which when our General heard he weighed anchor and stood in nearer  for the town and as we were under sail we met with one of the King's canoes coming towards us whereupon we dropt some of our sails and staid for the canoe until it came aboard us then stood into the bay which was hard by and came to an anchor In this canoe was the King's Secretary who had on his head a piece of died linen folded up like unto a Turkish turban He was all naked except about his waist his breast was carved with the broad arrow upon it he went barefooted He had an interpreter with him who was a Mestizo that is half an Indian and half a Portuguese who could speak very good Portuguese This Secretary signified unto our General that he had brought him an hog hens eggs fresh fish sugarcanes and wine which wine was as strong as aquavitae and as clear as any rockwater He told him farther that he would bring victuals so sufficiently for him as he and his company would request and that within the space of four days Our General used him singularly well banquetted him most royally with the choice of many and sundry conserves wines both sweet and otherwise and caused his musicians to make him music This done our General told him that he and his company were Englishmen that we had been at China and had trafficked in that country that we were come thither to make enquiries and purposed to go to Molucca The people told our General that there were certain Portuguese in the island who staid there as factors  continually to traffic with them to buy negroes cloves pepper sugar and many other commodities This Secretary of the King with his interpreter lay one night on board our ship The same night because they lay on board in the evening at the setting of the watch our General commanded every man in the ship to provide his harquebuss and his shot and so with shooting off forty or fifty small shot and a sacre himself set the watch This was no small wonder to these heathen people who had not commonly seen any ship so furnished with men and ordnance The next morning we dismissed the Secretary and his interpreter with all humanity  The fourth day after which was the th of March according to their appointment came the King's canoes but the wind being somewhat scant they could not get on board that night but put into a bay under the island until the next day and presently after the break of day there came to the number of nine or ten of the King's canoes so deeply laden with provisions as they could swim with two live oxen half a score of large fat hogs a number of live hens ducks and geese with eggs plantains sugarcanes sugar in plates cocoas sweet oranges and bitter limes great store of wine and aquavitae salt to season meat with and almost all manner of provisions besides accompanied with divers of the King's officers who were there Among all the rest of the people in one of these canoes came two Portuguese who were men of  middle stature and very proper personage they were each of them in a loose jerkin and hose which came down from the waist to the ancle according to the fashion of the country and partly because it was Lent and a time for doing of their penance They account it as a thing of great dishonour among these heathens to wear either hose or shoes on their feet The Portuguese had on each of them a very fair and a white lawn shirt with falling bands on the same very decent their bare legs excepted These Portuguese were no small joy unto our General and all the rest of our company for we had not seen any Christian that was our friend for a year and an half before Our General used and treated them singularly well with banquets and music They told us that they were no less glad to see us than we were to see them and enquired into the estate of their country and what was become of Don Antonio their King and whether he were living or not for that they had not been in Portugal for a long time and that the Spaniards had always brought them word that he was dead Then our General satisfied them in every demand assuring them that their King was alive and in England and had honourable allowance from our Queen and that there was war betwixt Spain and England and that we were come under the King of Portugal into the South Sea and had warred upon the Spaniards there and had fired spoiled and sunk all the ships along the coast that we could meet with  to the number of eighteen or twenty sail With this report they were abundantly satisfied  On the other side they declared unto us the state of the island of Java First the plentifulness great choice and store of provisions of all sorts and of all manner of fruits as before set down then the great and rich merchanchizes which are there to be had Then they described the nature and properties of the people as followeth The name of the King of that part of the island was Raya Bolamboam who was a man had in great majesty and fear among them The common people may not bargain sell or exchange any thing with any other nation without special licence from their King and if any so do it is present death for him The King himself is a man of great years and hath an hundred wives his son hath fifty The custom of the country is that whensoever the King doth die they take the dead body and burn it and preserve the ashes of him and within five days next after the wives of the said King so dead according to the custom and use of their country every one of them go together to a place appointed and the chief of the women who was nearest to him in account hath a ball in her hand and throweth it from her and to the place where the ball resteth thither they go all and turn their faces to the eastward and every one with a dagger in her hand which dagger they call a crise and is as sharp as a razor stab themselves to the heart and with their own hands  The KING of JAVA's Wives destroying themselves at his Death  bathe themselves in their blood and falling flat on their faces so end their days This thing is as true as it may seem to any hearer to be strange  The men of themselves are very politic and subtle and singularly valiant being naked men in any action they undertake and very submissive and obedient to their king for example if their king command them to undertake any exploit be it ever so dangerous or desperate they dare not nor will not refuse though they should die every man of them in executing the same for he will cut off the heads of every one of them who return alive without bringing their purpose to pass which is such a thing amongst them as maketh them the most valiant people in all the southeast parts of the world for they never fear any death for being in fight with any nation if any of them feeleth himself hurt with lance or sword he will willingly run himself upon the weapon quite through the body to procure his death the more speedily and in this desperate manner end his days or overcome his enemy Moreover although the men be tawny of colour and go continually naked yet their women are fair of complexion and go more apparelled  After they had thus described the state of the island and the order and fashion of the people they told us further that if their king Don Antonio would come unto them they would warrant him to have all the Moluccas at command  besides ChinaSanglos and the isles of the Philippines and that he might be assured to have all the Indians on his side that were in the country After we had fully contented these Portuguese and the people of Java who had brought us provisions in their canoes they took their leave of us with promise of all good entertainment at our return and our General gave them three great pieces of ordnance at their departing  Thus the next day being the th of March we set sail towards the Cape of Good Hope called by the Portuguese Cabo de Buena Esperanca on the most southern coast of Africa  The rest of March and all the month of April we spent in traversing that mighty and vast sea between the island of Java and the main of Africa observing the heavens the Crosiers or the Southpole the other stars the fowls which are marks unto seamen of fair weather and foul weather approaching of lands or islands the winds the tempests the rains and thunder with the alterations of tides and currents  The th day of May we had a storm from the west and it blew so hard that it was as much as the ship could steer close by under the wind and the storm continued all that day and all that night  The next day being the th of May in the morning one of the company went up to the  top and espied land bearing north and northbywest of us and about noon we espied land to bear west of us which we imagined to be the Cape of Buena Esperanca whereof indeed we were short about forty or fifty leagues and by reason of the scantness of the wind we stood along to the southeast until midnight at which time the wind came fair and we hauled along westward  The th and th days we were becalmed and the sky was very hazy and thick until the th day at three o'clock in the afternoon at which time the sky cleared and we spied land again which was that called Cabo Falso which is short of Cabo de Buena Esperanca forty or fifty leagues  This cape is very easy to be known for there are right over it three very high hills standing but a small way one off another and the highest standeth in the midst and the ground is much lower by the seaside The Cape of Good Hope beareth west and bysouth from the said Cabo Falso  The th day of May about four o'clock in the afternoon the wind came up at east a very brisk gale which continued till Saturday with as much wind as ever the ship could go before At which time by six o'clock in the morning we espied the promontory or headland called the Cabo de Buena Esperanca which is a pretty highland and at the westernmost point a little off the main appear two hummocks  the one upon the other and three other hummocks lying further off into the sea yet lowland between and adjoining unto the sea  This Cape of Buena Esperanca is set down and accounted leagues from the island of Java in the Portuguese sea charts but it is not so much by almost leagues as we found by the running of our ship We were in running of these leagues just nine weeks  The th day of June by break of day we fell in sight of the island of St Helena seven or eight leagues short of it having but a small gale of wind or almost none at all insomuch as we could not get into it that day but stood off and on all that night  The next day being the ninth of June having a pretty easy gale of wind we stood in with the shore our boat being sent away before to make the harbour and about one o'clock in the afternoon we came to an anchor in twelve fathoms water two or three cables length from the shore in a very fair and smooth bay under the northwest side of the island  This island is very high land and lieth in the main sea standing as it were in the midst of the sea between the main land of Africa the main of Brazilia and the coast of Guinea and is in fifteen degrees fortyeight minutes to the southward of the Equinoctial Line and is distant from the Cape of Buena Esperanca between five and six hundred leagues  The same day about two or three o'clock in the afternoon we went on shore where we found an exceeding fair and pleasant valley wherein divers handsome buildings and houses were set up and one particularly which was a church was tiled and whitened on the outside very fair and made with a porch and within the church at the upper end was set an altar whereon stood a very large table set in a frame having in it the picture of our Saviour Christ upon the cross and the image of our Lady praying with divers other histories curiously painted in the same The sides of the church were hung round with stained cloths having many devices drawn on them  There are two houses adjoining to the church on each side one which serve for kitchens to dress meat in with necessary rooms and houses of office The coverings of the said houses are made flat where is planted a very fair vine and through both the said houses runneth a very good and wholesome stream of fresh water  There is also over against the church a very fair causeway made up with stones reaching unto a valley by the seaside in which valley is planted a garden wherein grow great store of pompions and melons and upon the said causeway is a frame erected whereon hang two bells wherewith they ring to mass and near to it a cross is set up which is squared framed and made very artificially of freestone whereon is  carved in cyphers what time it was built which was in the year of our Lord  This valley is the fairest and largest low plot in all the island and is exceeding sweet and pleasant and planted in every place either with fruit or with herbs  There are figtrees which bear fruit continually and very plentifully for on every tree you may see blossoms green figs and ripe figs all at once and it is so all the year long The reason is that the island standeth so near the sun There is also great store of lemontrees orangetrees pomegranate trees pomecitrontrees and datetrees which bear fruit as the figtrees do and are planted carefully and very artificially with pleasant walks under and between them and the said walks are overshadowed with the leaves of the trees and in every void place is planted parsley sorrel basil fennel anniseed mustardseed radishes and many very good herbs The freshwater brook runneth through divers places in this orchard and may with very small pains be made to water any one tree in the valley  This fresh water stream cometh from the tops of the mountains and falleth from the cliff into the valley the height of a cable and hath many arms issuing out of it that refresh the whole island and almost every tree in it The island is altogether high mountains and steep vallies except it be on the tops of some hills and down below in some of the vallies where great plenty  of all those fruits before spoken of do grow There are much more growing on the tops of the mountains than below in the vallies but it is very toilsome and dangerous travelling up unto them and down again by reason of the height and steepness of the hills  There are also upon this island great store of partridges which are very tame not making any great haste to fly away though one come very near them but only to run away and get up into the steep cliffs we killed some of them with a fowlingpiece they differ very much from our partridges which are in England both in bigness and also in colour for they are almost as big as hens and are of an ash colour and live in covies twelve sixteen and twenty together you cannot go ten or twelve score paces but you shall see or spring one or two covies at the least  There are likewise no less plenty of pheasants in the island which are also very big and fat surpassing those which are in our country in bigness and in numbers in a company they differ not very much in colour from the partridges before spoken of We found moreover on this island plenty of Guineacocks which we call turkies of colour black and white with red heads they are much the same in bigness with ours in England their eggs are white and as big as a turkey's egg  There are in this island thousands of goats which the Spaniards call cabritos which are very  wild you shall see one or two hundred of them together and sometimes you may see them go in a flock almost a mile long some of them whether it be the nature of the breed of them or of the country I know not are as big as an ass with a mane like a horse and a beard hanging down to the very ground they will climb up the cliffs which are so steep that a man would think it a thing impossible that any living creature could go there We took and killed many of them for all their swiftness for there are thousands of them upon the mountains  Here are in like manner great store of swine which are very wild and fat and of great bigness they keep altogether upon the mountains and will very seldom abide any man to come near them except it be by mere chance when they are found asleep or otherwise according to their kind are taken lying in the mire  We found in the houses at our coming three slaves who were negroes and one who was born in the island of Java who told us that the EastIndian fleet which were in number five sail the least whereof was in burden eight or nine hundred tons all laden with spices and Calicut cloth with store of treasure and very rich stones and pearls were gone from the said island St Helena but twenty days before we came thither  This island hath been found long ago by the Portuguese and hath been altogether planted by them for their refreshment as they come  from the EastIndies and when they come they have all things in plenty for their relief by reason that they suffer none to inhabit there that might eat up the produce of the island except some very few sick persons of their company whom they suspect will not live until they come home these they leave there to refresh themselves and take them away the year following with the other fleet if they live so long They touch here rather in their coming home from the East Indies than at their going thither because they are thoroughly furnished with corn when they set out of Portugal but are meanly victualled at their coming from the Indies where there groweth but little corn  The th day of June having taken in wood and water and refreshed ourselves with such things as we found there and made clean our ship we set sail about eight o'clock at night towards England At our setting sail we had the wind at south east and we hauled northwest and bywest The wind is commonly off the shore at this island of St Helena  On Wednesday the d day of July we went away northwest the wind being still at southeast at which time we were in one degree and fortyeight minutes to the southward of the Equinoctial Line  The th day of the said month of July there was very little wind and towards night it was calm and blew no wind at all and so continued till Monday being the th day of July  On Wednesday the th day of the said month we had a small gale at westnorthwest We found the wind continually to blow at east and northeast and eastnortheast after we were in three or four degrees to the northward and it altered not until we came between thirty and forty degrees to the northward of the Equinoctial Line  On Wednesday the st day of August the wind came up at southwest a fair gale by which day at noon we were in thirtyeight degrees of north latitude  On Friday in the morning being the d of August at four o'clock we hauled east and eastbysouth for the most northern islands of the Azores  On Saturday the th day of the said month by five o'clock in the morning we fell in sight of the two islands of Flores and Cervo standing thirty nine degrees thirty minutes and sailed away northeast  The d of September we met with a Flemish hulk that came from Lisbon and declared unto us the overthrowing of the Spanish fleet to the singular rejoicing and comfort of us all  The th of September after a terrible tempest which carried away most part of our sails by the merciful favour of the Almighty we recovered our longwishedfor port of Plymouth in England from whence we set forth at the beginning of our voyage"  The wealth acquired in this voyage though very considerable was soon dissipated and in less than three years Cavendish again found himself under the necessity of preparing for a second in which however he was very unfortunate He had indeed increased his preparations and it is not to be doubted but that the certainty he had conceived of acquiring a more ample fortune by a second enterprize made him the more careless in the management of the treasure he had acquired by the first  The ships fitted out on this occasion were the Leicester commanded by himself as Admiral the Roebuck Captain Cocke ViceAdmiral the Desire Captain Davis RearAdmiral the Dainty Captain Coffen and the Black Pinnace whose Commander's name is not mentioned The Commanders in this expedition were some of the ablest navigators the nation produced and the highest expectations were formed from their fortitude and approved experience  Of the accounts that have been given of this expedition that published by John Jane a gentleman who accompanied Captain Davis in the Desire is the most complete for which reason we shall give it in the writer's own words as it is but in few hands and full of interesting events  "The th of Aug we departed from Plymouth says Mr Jane with three large ships and two barks  The th of November we fell in with the bay of Salvador upon the coast of Brasil twelve leagues on this side Cape Frio where we were becalmed until the d of December at which time we took a small bark bound for the river of Plate with sugar haberdashwares and negroes The master of this bark brought us to an isle called Placentia thirty leagues west from Cape Frio where we arrived the th of December and rifled six or seven houses inhabited by the Portuguese The th we departed from this place and the th arrived at the island of St Sebastian from whence Mr Cocke and Captain Davis presently departed with the Desire and Black Pinnace for taking the town of Santos The th at evening we anchored at the bar of Santos from whence we departed with our boats to the town by which expedition we took all the people at mass both men and women whom we kept all that day in the church a prisoners The cause why Mr Cavendish desired to take this town was to supply his great wants and having it now in quiet possession we stood in assurance of having provisions in great abundance But such was the negligence of Captain Cocke that the Indians were suffered to carry out whatsoever they would in open view and no man did controul them and the next day after we had won the town our prisoners were all set at liberty only four poor old men were kept as pledges to supply our wants Thus in three days the town which  was able to furnish such another fleet with all kinds of necessaries was left unto us nakedly bare without people and provisions  Eight or ten days after Mr Cavendish himself came hither where he remained until the d of January seeking by entreaty to have that whereof we were once possessed But in conclusion we departed worse furnished from the town than when we came unto it The d we burnt St Vincent's to the ground The th we set sail shaping our course for the straits of Magellan  The th of February we had a very great storm and the th our fleet was separated by the fury of the tempest Then our Captain called unto him the master of our ship a very honest and sufficient man and conferring with him he concluded to go for Port Desire hoping that the General would come thither because that in his first voyage he had found great relief there for our Captain could never get any direction what course to take in any such extremities though many times he had entreated for it as often I have heard him with grief report In sailing to this port by good chance we met with the Roebuck wherein Mr Cocke had endured great extremities and lost his boat and therefore desired our Captain to keep him company for he was in a very desperate situation Our Captain hoisted out his boat and went on board him to know his estate and returning told us the hardness thereof and desired the  Master and all the company to be careful in all their watches not to lose the Roebuck and so we both arrived at Port Desire the sixth of March  The th of March the Black Pinnace came to us but the Dainty came not but returned back to England leaving their Captain on board the Roebuck without any provision more than the apparel that he wore The th the Leicester came into the road and Mr Cavendish came into the harbour in a boat which he had made at sea for his long boat and pinnace were lost at sea and being on board the Desire he told our Captain of all his extremities and spoke most hardly of his company and of divers gentlemen that were with him purposing no more to go on board his own ship but to stay in the Desire We all sorrowed to hear such hard speeches of our good friends but having spoken with the gentlemen of the Leicester we found them faithful honest and resolute in proceeding although it pleased our General otherwise to conceive of them  The th of March we departed from Port Desire Mr Cavendish being in the Desire with us The th of April we fell in with the straits of Magellan enduring many furious storms between Port Desire and the strait The th we passed through the first strait The th we passed the second strait being ten leagues distant from the first The th we doubled Cape Froward which cape lieth in degrees minutes  The st we were forced through the fury of the weather to put into a small cove with our ships four leagues from the said cape upon the south shore where we remained until the th of May in the which time we endured extreme storms with perpetual snow where many of our men died with cursed famine and miserable cold not having wherewith to cover their bodies nor to fill their bellies but living by muscles water and weeds of the sea with a small relief from the ship's store in meal sometimes And all the sick men in the Leicester were most uncharitably put on shore into the woods in the snow rain and cold when men of good health could scarcely endure it where they ended their lives in the highest degree of misery Mr Cavendish all the while being on board the Desire In these great extremities of snow and cold doubting what the end would be he asked our captain's opinion because he was a man that had good experience of the northwest parts in his three several discoveries that way employed by the merchants of London Our captain told him that this snow was a matter of no long continuance and gave him sufficient reason for it and that thereby he could not much be prejudiced or hindered in his proceeding Notwithstanding he called together all the company and told them that he purposed not to stay in the straits but to depart upon some other voyage or else to return again for Brazil but his resolution was to go  for the Cape of Good Hope The company answered that if it pleased him they did desire to stay God's favour for a wind and to endure all hardness whatsoever rather than to give over the voyage considering they had been here but a small time and because they were within forty leagues of the South Sea it grieved them now to return notwithstanding whatever he ordered that they would perform So he concluded to go for the Cape of Good Hope and to give over this voyage Then our captain after Mr Cavendish was come on board the Desire from talking with the company told him that if it pleased him to consider the great extremity of his situation the slenderness of his provisions with the weakness of his men it was no course for him to proceed in that new enterprize for if the rest of your ships said he be furnished answerable to this it is impossible to perform your determination for we have no more sails than masts no victuals no groundtackling no cordage more than is overhead and among seventyfive persons there is but the master alone that can order the ship and but fourteen sailors the rest are gentlemen servingmen and artificers Therefore it will be a desperate case to take so hard an enterprize in hand These persuasions did our captain not only use to Mr Cavendish but also to Mr Cocke In fine upon a petition delivered in writing by the chief of the whole company the General determined to depart out of the straits of Magellan  and to return again for Santos in Brazil  So the th of May we set sail our General being then in the Leicester The th we were free of the straits but at Cape Froward it was our hard hap to have our boat sunk at our stern in the night and to lose all our oars  On the th being thwart of Port Desire in the night the General altered his course as we suppose by which occasion we lost him for in the evening he stood close by a wind to seaward having the wind at northnortheast and we standing the same way the wind not altering could not the next day see him so that we then persuaded ourselves that he was gone for Port Desire to relieve himself or that he had sustained some mischance at sea and was gone thither to remedy it Whereupon our captain called the General's men unto him with the rest and asked their opinion what was to be done Every one conjectured that the General was gone for Port Desire Then the Master being the General's man and careful of his master's service as also of good judgment in seamatters told the company how dangerous it was to go for Port Desire if we should there miss the General for said he we have no boat to land ourselves nor any anchors or cables that I dare trust in so quick streams as are there yet in all likelihood concluding that the General was gone thither we steered our course for Port Desire and by chance met with the Black Pinnace  which had likewise lost the fleet being in a very miserable case so we both concluded to seek the General at Port Desire  The th day of May we came to Port Desire where not finding our General as we hoped being most slenderly victualled without sails boat oars nails cordage and all other necessaries for our relief we were struck into a deadly sorrow But referring all to Providence we entered the harbour and found a place of quiet road which before we knew not Having moored our ship with the Pinnace's boat we landed upon the south shore where we found a standing pool of fresh water which by estimation might hold about ten tons whereby we were greatly comforted From this pool we fetched more than forty tons of water and yet we left the pool as full as we found it And because at our first being at this harbour we were at this place and found no water we persuaded ourselves that God had sent it for our relief Also there were such extraordinary low ebbs as we had never seen whereby we got muscles in plenty and great abundance of smelts so that with hooks made of pins every man caught as many as he could eat by which means we preserved our ships victuals and spent not any during the time of our abode here  Our Captain and Master considering our ability to go to the General found our wants so great as that in a month we could not fit our ship to set sail for we must needs set up a  smith's forge to make bolts spikes and nails besides the repairing of our other wants Whereupon they concluded it to be their best course to take the pinnace and to furnish her and to go to the General with all expedition leaving the ship and the rest of the company until the General's return for he had vowed to our Captain that he would return again to the straits as he had told us The Captain and Master of the pinnace being the General's men were well contented with the motion  But the General having in our ship two most pestilent fellows when they heard of this determination they utterly misliked it and in secret dealt with the company of both ships vehemently persuaded them that our Captain and Master would leave them in the country to be devoured by the cannibals and that they were merciless and without charity whereupon the whole company joined in secret with them in a night to murder our Captain and Master with myself and all those they thought were their friends There were marks taken in his cabin how to kill him with musquets through the ship's side and bullets made of silver for the execution if their other purposes should fail All agreed hereunto except the boatswain of our ship who when he knew the matter revealed it to the Master and so to the Captain Then the matter being called in question those two murderous fellows were found out whose names were Charles Parker and Edward Smith  The Captain being thus hardly beset in peril of famine and in danger of being murdered was constrained to use lenity and by courteous means to pacify this fury shewing that to do the General service unto whom he had vowed faith in this action was the cause why he purposed to go unto him in the pinnace considering that the pinnace was so necessary a thing for him as that he could not be without her because he was fearful of the shore in so great ships Whereupon all cried with cursing and swearing that the pinnace should not go unless the ship went Then the Captain desired them to shew themselves christians and not so blasphemously to behave themselves without regard and thanksgiving to God for their great deliverance By which gentle speeches the matter was pacified and the Captain and Master at the request of the company were content to forgive this great treachery of Parker and Smith who after many admonitions concluded in these words  "The Lord judge between you and me"  which after came to a most sharp revenge even by the punishment of the Almighty Thus by a general consent it was concluded not to depart but to stay there for the General's return Then our Captain and Master seeing that they could not do the General that service which they desired made a motion to the company that they would lay down under their hands the losing of the General with the extremities wherein we then stood whereunto  they consented and wrote under their hands what followeth  The Testimonial of the Company of the  Desire  touching the losing of their General which appeareth to have been utterly against their meanings  "THE th of August we whose names are here underwritten with divers others departed from Plymouth under Mr Thomas Cavendish our General with four ships of his viz the Leicester the Roebuck the Desire and the Black Pinnace for the performance of a voyage into the South Sea The th of November we fell in with the bay of Salvador in Brazil The th of December we took the town of Santos hoping there to revictual ourselves but it fell not out to our contentment The th of January we set sail from Santos shaping our course for the straits of Magellan The th of February by violent storms the said fleet being parted the Roebuck and the Desire arrived at Port Desire the sixth of March The sixteenth of March the Black Pinnace arrived there also and the th of the same our Admiral came into the road with whom we departed the th of March in poor and weak estate The th of April we entered the straits of Magellan The st of April we anchored beyond Cape Froward within leagues of the South Sea where we rode until the th of May In  which time we had great store of snow with some gusty weather the wind continuing still westnorthwest against us In this time we were inforced for the preserving of our victuals to live the most part upon muscles our provision was so slender so that many of our men died in this hard extremity Then our General returned for Brazil there to winter and to procure victuals for this voyage against the next year So we departed the straits the th of May The st being thwart of Port Desire leagues off the shore the wind then at northeast and bynorth at five of the clock at night lying northeast we suddenly cast about lying south east and bysouth and sometimes southeast the whole fleet following the Admiral our ship coming under his lee shot ahead of him and so framed sail fit to keep company This night we were severed by what occasion we protest we know not whether we lost them or they us In the morning we only saw the Black Pinnace then supposing the Admiral had overshot us All this day we stood to the eastwards hoping to find him because it was not likely that he would stand to the shore again so suddenly But missing him towards night we stood to the shoreward hoping by that course to find him The d of May at night we had a violent storm with the wind at northwest and we were inforced to hull not being able to bear sail and this night we perished our main tressletrees so that we could no more use our maintopsail lying  most dangerously in the sea The pinnace likewise received a great leak so that we were inforced to seek the next shore for our relief And because famine was like to be the best end we desired to go for Port Desire hoping with seals and penguins to relieve ourselves and so to make shift to follow the General or there to stay his coming from Brasil The th of May we had much wind at north The th was calm and the sea very lofty so that our ship had dangerous foul weather The th our foreshrouds broke so that if we had not been near the shore it had been impossible for us to get out of the sea And now being here moored in Port Desire our shrouds are all rotten not having a running rope whereto we may trust and being provided of only one shift of sails all worn our topsails not able to abide any stress of weather neither have we any pitch tar or nails nor any store for the supplying of these wants and we live only upon seals and muscles having but five hogsheads of pork within board and meal three ounces for a man a day with water for to drink And for as much as it hath pleased God to separate our fleet and to bring us into such hard extremities that only now by his mere mercy we expect relief though otherwise we are hopeless of comfort yet because the wonderful works of God in his exceeding great favour towards us his creatures are far beyond the scope of man's capacity therefore by him we hope to have deliverance in this our deep distress Also  for as much as those upon whom God will bestow the favour of life with return home to their country may not only remain blameless but also manifest the truth of our actions we have thought good in christian charity to lay down under our hands the truth of all our proceedings even till the time of this our distress  Given in Port Desire the d of June " c  After they had delivered this under their hands then we began to labour to preserve our lives and we built up a smith's forge and made nails bolts and spikes others made ropes of a piece of our cable and the rest gathered muscles and took smelts for the whole company Three leagues from this harbour there is an isle with four small isles about it where there are abundance of seals and at that time of the year the penguins came thither in great plenty to breed We concluded with the pinnace that she should sometimes go thither to catch seals for us upon which condition we would share victuals with her man for man whereunto the whole company agreed So we parted our poor store and she laboured to fetch us seals to eat wherewith we lived when smelts and muscles failed for in the neptides we could get no muscles Thus in the most miserable calamity we remained until the th of August still keeping watch upon the hills to look for our General and so great was our vexation and anguish of soul as I think never flesh and blood endured more Our misery daily increasing time passing  Cavendishes Crew  in Great distress at Port desire Setup a Forge repair their shatterd Vessels  and our hope of the General being very cold our Captain and Master were fully persuaded that the General might perhaps go directly for the straits and not come to this harbour whereupon they thought no course more convenient than to go presently for the straits and there to stay his coming for in that place he could not pass but of course we must see him Whereunto the company most willingly consented as also the Captain and Master of the pinnace so that upon this determination we made all possible speed to depart  The th of August we set sail and went to Penguin Isle and the next day we salted hogsheads of seals which was as much as our salt could do The th towards night we departed from Penguin Isle The th we had a sore storm so that we were constrained to hull for our sails were not fit to endure any force The th we were driven in among certain isles never before discovered by any known relation lying fifty leagues or better off the shore east and northerly from the straits in which place had not the wind ceased we must of necessity have perished But the wind shifting we directed our course for the straits and the th of August we fell in with the Cape in a very thick fog and the same night we anchored ten leagues within the Cape The th we passed the first and second straits The st we doubled Cape Froward The d we anchored in Salvage Cove so called because we saw many savages  there Notwithstanding the extreme cold of this place yet do all these people go naked and live in the woods like satyrs painted and disguised and flee from you like wild deer They are very strong and threw stones at us of three or four pounds weight an incredible distance The th in the morning we departed from this cove and the same day we came into the northwest reach which is the last reach of the straits The th we anchored in a good cove within leagues of the South Sea in this place we purposed to stay for the General for the strait at this place is scarce three miles broad so that he could not pass but we must see him After we had staid here a fortnight in the depth of winter our victuals consuming for our seals stunk most vilely and our men died pitifully through cold and famine for the greatest part of them had not cloaths to defend them from the extremity of the winter's cold being in this heavy distress our Captain and Master thought it the best course to depart from the straits into the South Sea and to go for the isle of Santa Maria which is to the northward of Baldivia in deg min where we might have relief and be in a temperate clime and there stay for the General for of necessity he must come by that isle So we departed the th of September and came in sight of the South Sea On the th we were forced back again and recovered a cove three leagues within the straits from the South Sea Again we put forth and being eight or ten leagues free  of the land the wind rising furiously at westnorthwest we were forced back again into the straits for want of sails for we never durst bear sail in any stress of weather they were so weak so again we recovered the cove three leagues within the straits where we endured most furious weather so that one of our two cables brake whereby we were hopeless of life yet it pleased God to calm the storm and we unreev'd our sheets tacks halliards and other ropes and moored our ship to the trees close by the rocks We laboured to recover our anchor again but could not it lay so deep in the water and as we think covered with oaze Now had we but one anchor which had but one whole fluke a cable spliced in two places and a piece of an old one In the midst of these our troubles the wind came fair the first of October whereupon with all expedition we loosed our moorings and weighed our anchor and so towed off into the channel for we had mended our boat in Port Desire and had five oars of the pinnace When we had weighed our anchor we found our cable broken only one strand held Being in the channel we reeved our ropes and again rigged our ship no man's hand was idle but all laboured even for the last gasp of life Here our company was divided some desired to go again for Port Desire and there to be set on shore where they might travel for their lives and some stood with the Captain and Master to proceed Whereupon the Captain said to the Master  "Master you  see the wonderful extremity of our estate and the great doubts among our company of the truth of your reports as touching relief to be had in the South Sea Now good Master for as much as you have been in this voyage once before with your Master the General satisfy the company of such truths as are to you best known and you the rest of the General's men who likewise have been with him in his first voyage if you hear any thing contrary to the truth spare not to reprove it I pray you"  Then the Master said  "If you think good to return I will not gainsay it but this I think if life may be preserved by any means it is in proceeding for at the isle of Santa Maria I do assure you of wheat pork and roots enough Also I will bring you to an isle where pelicans be in great abundance and we shall have meal in great plenty besides a possibility of intercepting some ships upon the coast of Chili and Peru But if we return there is nothing but death to be hoped for therefore do as you like I am ready but my desire is to proceed"  These his speeches being confirmed by others that were in the former voyage there was a general consent for proceeding and so the d of October we put into the South Sea and were free of all land This night the wind began to blow very much at westnorthwest and still increased in fury so that we were in great doubt what course to take To put into the straits we durst not for lack of groundtackle to bear sail we doubted the  tempest was so furious and our sails so bad The pinnace came round with us and told us that she had received many grievous seas and that her ropes did every hour fail her so as they could not tell what shift to make We being unable in any sort to help her stood under our courses in view of the leeshore still expecting our ruinous end  The th of October the storm growing beyond measure furious the pinnace being in the wind of us struck suddenly a hull so that we thought she had received some grievous sea or sprung a leak or that her sails failed her because she came not with us but we durst not hull in that unmerciful storm but sometimes tried under our main course sometimes with a haddock of our sail for our ship was very leeward and most laboursome in the sea This night we lost the pinnace and never saw her again  The th our foresail was split and all torn then our Master took the mizzen and brought it to the foremast to make our ship work and with our spritsail we mended our foresail the storm continuing beyond all description in fury with hail snow rain and wind such and so mighty as that in nature it could not possibly be more the sea such and so lofty with continual breach that many times we were doubtful whether our ship did sink or swim  The th of October being by the account of our Captain and Master very near the shore the weather dark the storm furious and most of our  men having given over to labour we yielded ourselves to death without further hope of succour Our Captain sitting in the gallery very pensive I came and brought him some  rosa solis  to comfort him for he was so cold that he was scarce able to move a joint After he had drank and was comforted in heart he began for the ease of his conscience to make a large repetition of his forepassed time and with many grievous sighs he concluded with a short prayer for our preservation Having ended he desired me not to make known to any of the company his intolerable grief and anguish of mind because they should not thereby be dismayed And so suddenly before I went from him the sun shined clear so that he and the Master both observed the true elevation of the Pole whereby they knew by what course to recover the straits Wherewithal our Captain and Master were so revived and gave such comfortable speeches to the company that every man rejoiced as though we had received a present deliverance The next day being the th of October we saw Cape Deseado being the cape on the south shore the north shore being nothing but a company of dangerous rocks isles and shoals This cape being within two leagues to the leeward of us our Master greatly doubted that we could not double the same nevertheless being a man of good spirit he resolutely made quick dispatch and set sail Our sails had not been half an hour on board but the footrope of our foresail  brake so that nothing held but the oyletholes The seas continually brake over the ship's poop and flew into the sails with such violence that we still expected the tearing of our sails or oversetting of the ship and besides to our utter discomfort we perceived that we fell still more and more to leeward so that we could not double the cape We were now come within half a mile of the cape and so near the shore that the counter surf of the sea would rebound against the ship's side so that we were much dismayed with the horror of our present end Being thus at the very point of our death the wind and the seas raging beyond measure our Master veered some of the main sheet and whether it was by that occasion or by some current or by the wonderful power of God as we verily think it was the ship quickened her way and shot past that rock where we thought we should have shored Then between the cape and the point there was a little bay so that we were somewhat farther from the shore and when we came so far as the cape we yielded to death yet the Father of all mercies delivered us and we doubled the cape about the length of our ship or very little more Being shot past the cape we presently took in our sails which only God had preserved unto us and when we were shot in between the high lands the wind blowing trade without an inch of sail we spooned before the sea three men being not able to guide the helm and in six hours we were put twentyfive  leagues within the straits where we found a sea answerable to the ocean  In this time we freed our ship from water and after we had rested a little our men were not able to move their sinews were stiff and their flesh dead and many of them which is most lamentable to be reported were so eaten with lice as that in their flesh did lie clusters of them as big as pease yea and some as big as beans Being in this misery we were constrained to put into a cove for the refreshing of our men Our Master knowing the shore and every cove very perfectly put in with the shore and moored to the trees as before time we had done laying our anchor to the seaward Here we continued until the th of October but not being able any longer to stay through extremity of famine the st we put off into the channel the weather being reasonably calm but before night it blew most extremely at westnorthwest The storm growing outrageous our men could scarcely stand by their labour and the straits being full of turning reaches we were constrained by the discretion of the Captain and Master in their accounts to guide the ship in the helldark night when we could not see any shore the channel being in some places scarce three miles broad But our Captain as we first passed through the straits drew such an exquisite plan of the same as I am assured it cannot in any sort be bettered which plan he and the Master so often perused and so carefully regarded as that in memory they had  every turn and creek and in the deepdark night without any doubting they conveyed the ship through that crooked channel so that I conclude the world hath not any so skilful pilots for that place as they are for otherwise we could never have passed in such sort as we did  The th we came to an island in the straits named Penguin Isle whither we sent our boat to seek relief for there were great abundance of birds and the weather was very calm so we came to an anchor by the island in seven fathoms While our boat was on shore and we had great store of penguins there arose a sudden storm so that our ship did drive over a breach and our boat sunk at the shore Captain Cotton and the Lieutenant being on shore leapt into the boat and freed the same and threw away all the birds and with great difficulty recovered the ship myself also was in the boat at the same time where for my life I laboured to the best of my power The ship all this while driving upon the leeshore when we came on board we helped to set sail and weighed the anchor for before our coming they could scarce hoist up their yards yet with much ado they set their forecourse Thus in a mighty fret of weather the th day of October we were free of the straits and the th of October we came to Penguin Isle being three leagues from Port Desire the place where we purposed to seek for our relief  When we were come to this isle we sent our boat on shore which returned laden with birds  and eggs and our men said the penguins were so thick upon the isle that ships might be laden with them for they could not go without trampling upon the birds whereat we greatly rejoiced Then the captain appointed Charles Parker and Edward Smith with twenty others to go on shore and to stay upon the isle for the killing and drying of these penguins and promised after the ship was in harbour to send the rest not only for expedition but also to save the small store of victuals in the ship But Parker Smith and the rest of their faction suspected that this was a device of the captain's to leave his men on shore that by these means there might be victuals for the rest to recover their country and when they remembered that this was the place where they would have slain their captain and master surely thought they for revenge hereof will they leave us on shore Which when our captain understood he called God to witness that revenge was no part of his thoughts they gave him thanks desiring to go into the harbour with the ship which he granted So there were only ten left upon the isle and the last of October we entered the harbour Our master at our last being here having taken careful notice of every creek in the river in a very convenient place upon sandy oaze ran the ship aground laying our anchor to seaward and with our running ropes moored her to stakes upon the shore which he had fastened for that purpose where the ship remained till our departure  The d of November our boat with water wood and as many as she could carry went for the isle of Penguins but being deep she durst not proceed but returned again the same night Then Parker Smith Townshend Purpet with five others desired that they might go by land and that the boat might fetch them when they were against the isle it being scarce a mile from the shore The captain bade them do what they thought best advising them to take weapons with them  "For saith he although we have not at any time seen people in this place yet in the country there may be savages"  They answered  "That here were great store of deer and ostriches but if there were savages they would devour them"  Notwithstanding the captain caused them to take weapons with them carlivers swords and targets so the th of November they departed by land and the boat by sea but from that day to this day we never heard of our men The th while most of our men were at the isle only the captain and master with six others being left in the ship there came a great multitude of savages to the ship throwing dust in the air leaping and running like brute beasts having vizards on their faces like dogs faces or else their faces are dogs faces indeed We greatly feared lest they would set our ship on fire for they would suddenly make fire whereat we much marvelled they came to windward of our ship and set the bushes on fire so that we were  in a very stinking smoak but as soon as they came within our shot we shot at them and striking one of them in the thigh they all presently fled so that we never saw more of them Hereby we judged that these cannibals had slain our nine men When we considered who they were that were thus murdered and found that they were the principal men who would have murdered the captain and master with their friends we saw the just judgment of God and made supplication to his Divine Majesty to be merciful unto us While we were in this harbour our captain and master went with the boat to discover how far this river did run that if need should enforce us to leave our ship we might know how far we might go by water so they found that farther than twenty miles they could not go with the boat At their return they sent the boat to the isle of penguins whereby we understood that the penguins dried to our hearts content and that the multitude of them was infinite All the time that we were in this place we fared passing well with eggs penguins young seals young gulls and other birds such as I know not of all which we had abundance In this place we found an herb called Scurvygrass which we fried with eggs using trainoil instead of butter This herb did so purge the blood that it took away all kinds of swellings of which many had died and restored us to perfect health of body so that we were in as good case as when we came first out  of England We staid in this harbour until the d of December in which time we had dried penguins and the captain the master and myself had made some salt by laying saltwater upon the rocks in holes which in six days would be kerned Thus God did feed us even as it were with manna from heaven  The d of December we departed with our ship for the isle where with great difficulty by the skilful industry of our master we got of our birds and had almost lost our captain in labouring to bring the birds on board and had not our master been very expert in the set of those tides which run after many fashions we had also lost our ship in the same place The d at night we departed with dried penguins not being able to fetch the rest and shaped our course for Brazil Now our captain rated our victuals and brought us to such allowance as that our victuals might last six months for our hope was that within six months we might recover our country though our sails were very bad So our allowance was two ounces and an half of meal for a man aday and to have so twice aweek so that five ounces did serve for a week Three days a week we had oil three spoonfuls for a man aday and two days in a week pease a pint among four men aday and every day five penguins for four men and six quarts of water for four men aday This was our allowance  wherewith we lived though weakly and very feeble The th of January we arrived at the isle of Placentia in Brazil the first place that outwardbound we were at and having made the shoal our ship lying off at sea the captain with twentyfour of the company went with the boat on shore being a whole night before they could recover it The last of January at sunrising they suddenly landed hoping to take the Portuguese in their houses and by that means to recover some Casavi meal or other victuals for our relief but when they looked for the houses they were all razed and burnt to the ground so that we thought no man had remained on the island Then the captain went to the gardens and brought from thence fruits and roots for the company and came on board the ship and brought her into a fine creek which we had found out where we might moor her by the trees and where there was water and hoops to trim our casks Our case being very desperate we presently laboured for dispatch away some cut hoops which the coopers made others laboured upon the sails and ship every man travailing for his life and still a guard was kept on shore to defend those that laboured every man having likewise his weapon by him The d of February our men with twentythree shot went again to the gardens being three miles from us upon the north shore and fetched Casaviroots out of the ground to relieve our company instead of bread for we spent not of  our meal while we staid here The th of February being Monday our captain and master hastened the company to their labour so some went with the coopers to gather hoops and the rest laboured on board This night many of our men in the ship dreamed of murder and slaughter in the morning they reported their dreams one saying to another  "This night I dreamed that thou wert slain"  Another answered  "And I dreamed that thou wert slain"  And this was general through the ship The Captain hearing this who likewise had dreamed very strangely himself gave very strict charge that those who went on shore should take weapons with them and saw them himself delivered into the boat and sent some on purpose to guard the labourers All the forenoon they laboured in quietness and when it was ten o'clock the heat being extreme they came to a rock near the wood's side for all this country is nothing but thick woods and there they boiled Casaviroots and dined After dinner some slept others washed themselves in the sea all being stripped to their shirts and no man keeping watch no match lighted and not a piece charged Suddenly as they were thus sleeping and sporting having got themselves into a corner out of sight of the ship there came a multitude of Indians and Portuguese upon them and slew them sleeping only two escaped one very sore hurt the other not touched by whom we understood of this miserable massacre  With all speed we manned our boat and landed to succour our men but we found them slain and laid naked in rank one by another with their faces upward and a cross set by them and withal we saw two very great pinnaces come from the river of Janeiro very full of men who we suspected came from thence to take us because there came from Janeiro soldiers to Santos when the General had taken the town and was strong in it Of seventysix persons who departed in our ship out of England we were now left but twentyseven having lost thirteen in this place with their chief furniture as muskets calivers powder and shot Our casks were all in decay so that we could not take in more water than was in our ship for want of casks and that which we had was marvellous illconditioned And being there moored by trees for want of cables and anchors we still expected the cutting of our moorings to be beaten from our decks with our own furniture and to be assailed by them of Janeiro What distress we were now driven into I am not able to express To depart with eight tons of water in such bad casks was to starve at sea and in staying our case was ruinous These were hard choices but being thus perplexed we made choice rather to fall into the hands of the Lord than into the hands of men So concluding to depart the th of February we were off in the channel with our ordnance and small shot in readiness for any assault that should come and having a small  gale of wind we recovered the sea in most deep distress Then bemoaning our estate one to another and recounting over all our extremities nothing grieved us more than the loss of our men twice first being slaughtered by the cannibals at Port Desire and at this isle of Placentia by the Indians and Portuguese And considering what they were who were lost we found that all those who conspired the murdering of our Captain and Master were now slain by savages the gunner only excepted Being thus at sea when we came to Cape Frio the wind was contrary so that three weeks we were grievously vexed with cross winds and our water consuming our hope of life was very small Some desired to go to Baya and to submit themselves to the Portuguese rather than to die for thirst but the Captain with fair persuasions altered their purpose of yielding to the Portuguse In this distress it pleased God to send us rain in such plenty as that we were well watered and in good comfort to return But after we came near unto the sun our dried penguins began to corrupt and there bred in them a most loathsome and ugly worm of an inch long This worm did so mightily increase and devour our victuals that there was in reason no hope how we should avoid famine but he devoured of these wicked creatures there was nothing that they did not devour iron only excepted our cloaths hats boots shoes shirts and stockings and for the ship they did so eat the timbers as that we  greatly feared they would undo us by gnawing through the ship's side Great was the care of our Captain Master and company to consume these vermin but the more we laboured to kill them the more they increased so that at the last we could not sleep for them but they would eat our flesh and bite like musquetos In this woeful case after we had passed the Equinoctial Line towards the north our men began to  sick of such a monstrous disease as I think the like was never heard of for in their ancles it began to swell from thence in two days it would be in their breasts so that they could not draw their breath and then fell into their lower parts and there did swell most grievously and most dreadful to behold so that they could neither stand  nor go whereupon our men grew big with grief Our Captain with extreme anguish of his soul was in such woeful distress that he desired only a speedy end for divers grew raging mad and some died in most loathsome and furious pain It were incredible to write our misery as it was There was no man in perfect h  alth but the Captain and one boy the Master being a man of good spirit with extreme labour bore out his grief so that it grew not upon him To be short all our men died except sixteen of which there were but five able to move The Captain was in good health the Master indifferent Captain Cotton and myself swolen and shortwinded yet better than the rest who were sick and one  boy in health upon us five only the labour of the ship did stand The Captain and Master as occasion served would take in and heave out the topsails the Master only attended on the spritsail and all of us at the capstan without sheets and tacks In fine our misery and weakness was so great that we could not take in or heave out a sail so our topsail and spritsail were torn all in pieces by the weather The Master and Captain taking their turns at the helm were mightily distressed and monstrously grieved with the woeful lamentation of our sick men Thus as lost wanderers upon the sea the th of June it pleased God that we arrived at Bear Haven in Ireland and there ran the ship on shore where the Irishmen helped us to take in our sails and to moor our ship for floating which slender pains of theirs cost our Captain ten pounds before he could have the ship in safety Thus without victuals sails men or any furniture God only guided us into Ireland where the Captain left the Master and three or four of the company to keep the ship and within five days after he and certain others had passage in an English fisherboat to Padstow in Cornwall In this manner our small remnant by God's mercy only were preserved and restored to our country to whom be all honour and glory world within end"  We have already observed that the above relation is the only complete account of this voyage  which has hitherto appeared by which we would be understood to mean that it is the only complete account of the proceedings of any one of the ships engaged in this second expedition of Cavendish from her first setting out till her return home There are other accounts of the distresses attending this voyage but they refer to parts only and do not contain a regular series of events from beginning to end as we shall endeavour to shew in pursuance of our plan of tracing the great outlines of the lives of our celebrated circumnavigators from their first entering upon action till the period of their retreat  When the impartial reader revolves in his mind the effects of distresses like those already described in the foregoing account upon a company of ungovernable sailors not under that subordination which regular discipline always establishes to officers properly commissioned he will then be prepared to determine whether Cavendish complains with reason against Davis as being the death of him and to use his own words  "the decay of the whole action"  or whether the miscarriage did not arise partly from unavoidable accidents and partly from the impetuosity of his own temper and his own misconduct  The misfortunes that attended the progress of this most distressful voyage appear to us to have taken their rise from the accident of being becalmed for sevenandtwenty days under the Line during which time they not only consumed  a considerable proportion of their provisions but the men became sick and the scurvy which seldom makes its approaches on this side the Equator had already infected near half the crews  This reduced them to the necessity not only of seeking land where fresh provisions might be procured but of wasting more time with a view to the recovery of the sick than was consistent with the navigation of those boisterous seas through which they were to pass  We have already seen that when they were masters of Santos they were in the utmost distress for want of provisions and yet the opportunity was suffered to pass without obtaining any effectual relief and that this distress is not aggravated by the writer of the above voyage appears from the testimony of Knivet in Purchas's Pilgrams who says  "that here they had such disorders among themselves that if the Portuguese had been of any courage they might have destroyed the whole fleet for our men says he would fight for their victuals as if they had been no Christians but Jews" which by the way shews the strange notions which the multitude in those days entertained of the uncharitable disposition of the Jews to one another a characteristic not at all applicable to that people "and they that got the best would get them into some hole or into the wilderness under some tree and there they would remain as long as they had meat"  From this early beginning of distress very little hope could be reasonably entertained of the issue The season was advancing fast when the severity of the weather would render their proceeding into the South Seas by the straits of Magellan very dangerous and being already in want of provisions they could have no means of an effectual supply till they could reach the fertile countries on the opposite side of those straits the General's prolonging his stay therefore on the eastermost coasts of Brazil till the d of January was not only an imprudent but a fatal delay and as it was foreseen proved the actual ruin of the voyage  At the time when they should have passed the straits of Magellan they were in consultation if not worse employed at Santos and after they set sail they were attacked by a storm of which Cavendish himself says  "a  worser  might not be endured Such was the fury of the westsouthwest winds as we were driven from the shore four hundred leagues and constrained to beat from deg to the southward into degrees to the northward again before we could come near the shore in which time we had a new shift of sails clean blown away and our ship in danger to sink in the sea three times which with extremity of men's labour we recovered"  Here the reason that prevented Cavendish's arrival at Port Desire till the th of March days after the Desire and Roebuck is fully explained And  And after he had refitted his ship and refreshed his men and was ready to sail he goes on in the same letter which is directed to Sir Tristriam Gorges  "And now" says he "we were almost four months beating between the coast of Brazil and the straits being in distance not above leagues which is commonly run in twenty or thirty days but such was the adverseness of our fortune that in coming thither we spent the summer and found in the straits the beginning of a most extreme winter not durable for Christians"  After this concession compared with what the writer of Davis's voyage has related of the sufferings of his people let the reader determine with what justice Cavendish arraigns Davis when he attributes to the villainy of that officer his own death and the ruin of the voyage  But to pursue the narrative of the General's proceedings from the time of his parting with the Desire and Black Pinnace in the night of the th of May as already related in the preceding voyage It appears indeed that he continued his course to the coast of Brazil accompanied by the Roebuck which however was parted from him in lat  S in one of the most grievous storms as he himself confesses that any Christians ever endured upon the seas to live in which the Roebuck sprung her masts and was otherwise so much damaged as to arrive in the bay of St Vincent in the greatest distress being little better than a mere wreck  The General himself suffered considerably and was forced to take shelter likewise in the same bay though the little town of St Vincent they had burnt on their leaving Santos the summer before Here twentyfive of his men getting drunk on shore were suddenly set upon by the Portuguese in revenge for their former treatment and every man of them slaughtered To revenge this treachery as it is called Cavendish determined to attack Santos and to level it with the ground and now being joined by the crew of the Roebuck he landed above the town but was most shamefully repulsed after having plundered a few farmhouses and as it should seem the custom was set them on fire  Here being disappointed of his revenge he departed with a view to attack a small inhabited island about twenty leagues to the westward from whence when he had provided himself with such necessaries as the island could afford he intended according to his promise and agreeable to the expectations of Davis to have returned to the straits of Magellan and to have proceeded to the South Seas in prosecution of his first design But there seemed a fatality attending every measure he devised  He was diverted from the prosecution of this enterprize by the persuasions of a Portuguese pilot on board who advised the attack of Spirito Santo as the only place that could supply his wants and enable him to refit his ships In this undertaking he lost fourscore of his men  killed and forty wounded And now having no alternative but either to return home or to burn one of his ships for want of hands and proceed with the other to the straits the crew of the Roebuck fearing as they well might that theirs was the ship destined for the flames watched their opportunity when their Captain was sick on board the General to make their escape in the night taking with them both the surgeons and as Cavendish says double the proportion of provisions for their number of men  "having with them at their departure but six and forty men and carrying away with them the proportion for six months victual of men at large"  Yet it is not easy to reconcile the truth of this assertion with the distresses for want of provisions which are all along complained of from their first arrival on the coast of Brazil in the summer to the present time In the straits of Magellan it is asserted that to save their victuals they were forced in a great measure to live upon seaweeds muscles periwincles and the fruits of the country for says Knivet the allowance from the ship was but littleBut to proceed  Cavendish finding himself thus forsaken every where disappointed betrayed as he complains and distressed to the last extremity his ship full of sick and wounded and himself with a wounded spirit directed his course to the island of St Sebastian leagues to the westward of Spirito Santo where he arrived when he had  but just one cask of water left Here he set of his sick men ashore and having refitted his ship and refreshed his people he wanted very much to have sailed back to the straits  "But says his biographer his mutinous crew obliged him to sail for England"  and he died before his return  In his letter to Sir Tristriam Gorges which appears to have been written a little before his death he discovers the utmost perturbation of mind  "And now says he what with grief for the loss of my most dear cousin John Lock and the continual trouble I endured among such hellhounds his ship's crew wishing myself upon any desart place in the world there to die rather than thus basely to return home again which course I had put in execution had I found an island which the charts make to be in eight degrees to the southward of the Line I swear to you I sought it with all diligence meaning if I had found it there to have ended my unfortunate life But God suffered not such happiness to light upon me for I could by no means find it so was forced to come towards England"  The bitterness which he expresses against his crew might and did probably arise from their determined resolution not to expose themselves to the like hardships they had already undergone and in which the major part of their companions were suffered to perish without pity  and to languish without relief for if we may believe Jane the sick men on board the General were most uncharitably put on shore into the woods in the straits of Magellan where according to Cavendish's own account  "there was nothing but such flights of snow and extremities of frosts as in his life he had never beheld or felt the like The men adds he were well in the morning and by night frozen to death"  In this miserable manner in seven or eight days of his crew actually perished and more sickened  Of the ships that sailed in this expedition consisting of five sail we can trace only three that returned to England namely the Galleon otherwise named the Leicester of which the General was Commander the Dainty commanded by Captain Cotton who went a volunteer and whose ship having parted company on her first arrival on the coast of Brazil instead of pursuing her voyage to the South Seas returned back to England with very little damage  The Roebuck in which sailed from Plymouth brave seamen after stealing away from the General in the night as already related was never more heard of the Black Pinnace foundered in a violent storm in the South Sea and in her about men Of the crews of the Desire only out of lived to see their native country and of the General's ship though the number that perished cannot be exactly ascertained yet there could not more than at most survive their General  Now if the gallant actions and glorious exploits that entitle men to fame and immortality involve in their atchievement so many of their fellowcreatures in misery let the benevolent and humane unite with us in depreciating such murderous practices and instead of holding forth a Drake or a Cavendish as examples worthy of imitation let us hold in detestation all those false worthies whose actions have their rise in  "a ravenous appetite for robbery and in an insatiable desire of acquiring wealth without industry and greatness without virtue"  THE VOYAGES OF CAPT WILLIAM DAMPIER  AMONG the Navigators who first surrounded the globe Captain William Dampier considered as a Mariner and Naturalist will ever be held in the

and improvement of one art  He was the son of parents who lived in the parish of East Coker in Somersetshire reputable but not rich While they lived they gave him an education very ill suited to a seafaring life but they both dying when he was yet young those to whose care he was entrusted removed him from the grammarschool and put him to an English school to learn writing and accompts Here he did not remain long before  an opportunity offered of placing him with the master of a ship at Weymouth agreeable to the inclinations which he had very early discovered of going to sea a lesson to parents and guardians to consult the genius of children if they would wish them to rise to eminence in the profession to which they are bred  With this master he made a short voyage to France and was highly gratified but his next voyage being to Newfoundland where he was employed a whole summer in the fishery the rigour of the climate and the nature of the servi  so cooled his ardour for seaadventures that he  termined to relinquish the employment and return to his friends  He was now eighteen years of age and after leading for some time an idle life finding his friends begin to look cool upon him he formed a resolution to leave the country and to try his fortune in town His course of life and the natural bent of his inclination led him to seek the company of seafaring companions who being pleased with his jovial humour encouraged him to resume his old employment to which having an opportunity to enter on board an Indiaman he was easily persuaded  In this ship the John and Martha Captain Earning he sailed to Bantam in quality of a foremastman and in little more than a year returned to England perfectly reconciled to the business of a mariner which by the severity of  the service he was first employed in he had determined never to follow  In this voyage by favour of the master of the ship he learned the rudiments of the art of navigation in which he afterwards became a great proficient but he had not yet learned to keep a journal It should seem that he employed the following year after his Indian voyage in improving those hints which he received from the master and in qualifying himself for an easier and more advantageous birth than that of going before the mast for the future With this view he retired again into the country and spent the summer with his brother But tired of a studious life he embraced the occasion of the Dutch war to enter on board the Royal Prince commanded by Sir Edward Sprague but in what station does not appear He tells us indeed that he was in two engagements but that falling sick he was put on board the hospital ship and saw the third only at a distance in which his Commander was unfortunately killed so that he does not seem to have risen higher at this period than the ordinary rank of an able seaman  Being soon after removed to Harwich among the rest of the sick and wounded he there languished till the conclusion of the Dutch war when he received his discharge and then returned again to Somersetshire for the recovery of his health which was no sooner restored man he prepared again to go to sea  But Colonel Hellier a neighbouring Gentleman having a large plantation in Jamaica being acquainted with his resolution made him an offer of going there as a superintendant with a handsome appointment which he very readily accepted and about the beginning of the year embarked for Jamaica But he soon grew tired of land service his roving disposition still inclining him to seek the sea The road he says to take possession of his new office when he arrived at Jamaica was formerly a great way round but Mr Hellier the Colonel's brother being desirous of shortening the way coasted along the river with some companions till they found it run between rocks that rose perpendicular on both sides they endeavoured to climb that which intercepted the way to the plantation but while they with the utmost danger and difficulty were surmounting the rock a dog they had with them found a more convenient passage through a hole This suggested to Mr Hellier a new track so by blowing up some fragments of the rock in one part and levelling some hollows in others a passage was obtained wide enough for a loaded horse By this accidental discovery the road was shortened near one half  He was now in his d year In six months after his arrival at Jamaica he was tired of his superintendency and quitted it and soon after engaged in a trade with the logwoodcutters in Campeachy bay which trade he followed near three years and then commenced logwoodcutter  himself Unsettled in his mind and still eager in pursuit of new adventures in less than a year he quitted the logwoodcutters and about the beginning of returned to England  In we find him again returned to Jamaica with a cargo of merchandize which being sold at Port Royal he furnished himself with other goods such as he knew he could carry to a good market at Campeachy and by this advantageous traffic he so inriched himself as to be able to purchase an estate in his own country of one whom he knew had a good title to it And now sufficiently happy he was preparing to return home when one Mr Hobby invited him to make a short trading voyage to the Moskitoshore a part of the world he had not yet seen This invitation to embark in a new adventure he could not resist and therefore sent home the writings of his late purchase to his brother with the same friends whom he purposed to have accompanied to England himself and then went on board with Mr Hobby  The Moskitos he says are Indians that inhabit the main between the Honduras and Nicaragua They are tall wellmade rawboned lusty strong and nimble of foot long visaged have lank black hair look stern are hard favoured and of a dark coppercoloured complexion They are but a small nation the same perhaps that Drake calls Symerons They are very dexterous at throwing the lance fisgig harpoon or any manner of dart being bred to it  from their infancy for the children imitating their parents never go abroad without a lance which they throw indifferently at almost every object that falls in their way till by constant practice they become masters of the art They next learn to parry a lance arrow or dart and the training of them to this exercise is in this manner Two boys place themselves at a small distance and throw light blunt lances at each other one throws the lance and the other parries alternately He that parries holds a small stick in his right hand with which he turns aside the lance that is darted at him and by constantly practising in this manner they at last become so dexterous that they will shoot arrows at each other and parry them as fast as they are shot This they will do with a small stick no bigger than the rammer of an ordinary fowlingpiece  Before they arrive at manhood they become so dexterous that they disregard the arrows of their enemies and unless they are poured thick upon them and come more than one at a time they will suffer not one in a thousand to hit them  They are no less expert at strinking of fish and two or three of them will in those seas maintain a ship's company of men Turtle and manatee are their principal pursuit the former will commonly weigh weight and two Moskito men will strike two of them aday while the season lasts for many days together  The manatee is known also by the name of the seacow and is struck with a harpoon so contrived by the Moskitomen as to be thrown with a long stick but they are very cautious of discovering their art even to the Englishthe Spaniards they hate mortally The turtle they strike with a different instrument of which our author has given a cut  About this time the aera of buccaneering commences The buccaneers were a set of low men who in humble imitation of their betters first began with fitting out small vessels in some of the islands in the West Indies and then cruising in them till they were able to make themselves masters of better ships This being accomplished they went in formidable companies as occasion offered and declared open war against all the Spanish settlements These freebooters had generally two or three Moskitomen on board each of their vessels whom they found serviceable in many other respects besides supplying them with fish By their situation they had opportunities of being well acquainted with the strength and riches of the Spanish settlements and by their inclination they were their avowed enemies They therefore served the buccaneers for guides and at the same time assisted in their most hazardous attacks  This being premised let us now return to Dampier who as has just been said had agreed to make a voyage with Captain Hobby and having set sail from Port Royal either by  accident or design they fell in with Coxen Sawkings Sharp and other buccaneers who were riding at anchor on the west side of the island of Jamaica and were then meditating an enterprize over the isthmus of Darien in order to fall suddenly upon the Spaniards in the South Seas This expedition it was given out would enrich the undertakers and as all who engaged in it according to the law of buccaneers were to be proportionable sharers all Captain Hobby's men deserted him to join the buccaneers Dampier only excepted who after three or four days consideration was easily persuaded to make one among the rest  Shortly after Christmas they all set sail and steering to Porto Bello on the th of April they landed near Golden Island to the number of between three and four hundred men and began their march guided by chiefs of the Muskito Indians and headed by Captain Sawkings who by general consent was chosen their leader  After a fatiguing journey of nine days in which many of them suffered great hardships they arrived at Santa Martha a Spanish settlement on a river of that name that empties itself into the Southern ocean which after some opposition they took They were made to believe before they approached it that it was a place of considerable strength abounding in riches and inhabited by merchants of considerable property but upon entering it they were  greatly disappointed and therefore as might be expected from such a lawless crew they were as ready to fall upon those who had projected the enterprize as upon those whom they accounted the enemy  They now much discontented with one another parted company One party continuing their march to the Southern ocean and there embarking some in canoes some in periagos and some in small barks which they found in the river continued their course to the bay of Panama and in their way attempted the little town of Puebla Novo before which their commander in chief Captain Sawkings was killed and his followers defeated In what manner this undisplined crew procured ships guns and ammunition we are not told yet ships guns and ammunition to pursue their ravages they did procure as appears by the sequel  Captain Coxen with his company foreseeing many difficulties in this Southern project after the taking of Santa Martha returned to the North Seas where he continued his piracies with various success  Dampier however followed the views of those who persevered in their first resolution of prosecuting their fortune in the South Seas and he continued to accompany them during the year but after the death of Sawkings Captain Sharpe being chosen commander in chief in his room Dampier with many of his companions suspecting both the courage  and honesty of their new leader entered into a confederacy to displace him and to choose Capt Watling in his room which they soon found means to accomplish by general consent Under Captain Sharpe the only enterprize of consequence was the taking of Ylo a small island on the Peruvian coast from whence they sailed to Juan Fernandez where as has been said Captain Sharpe was displaced  It happened however that Captain Watling soon after his advancement having planned an attack upon Arica sell a victim to his own project for he was killed in the first onset and his party defeated The confederates after this misfortune remaining some time without a leader fell again into party divisions one party declaring themselves in favour of their former Commander the other opposing his reelection To put an end to these dissentions it was at last agreed to part companies and to cast lots which company should keep possession of the ship It happened that the party in opposition to Dampier proved the fortunate party so that Dampier and his companions were reduced to the necessity of returning either to the N Sea over the same isthmus by which they came into the South or submitting themselves to the mercy of the Spaniards Nor does it appear that any of them carried more riches back than they brought with them notwithstanding the vast promises with which they had been flattered at their first setting out for it has been generally observed  that the confederacies of the wicked are defeated by their own deceit and that they themselves are for the most part the instruments of their own misfortunes  The company with which Dampier chose to associate consisted of men who bore arms a Spanish Indian who bore arms also two Moskito Indians already described with five slaves taken in the South Seas whom they kept to carry their luggage The vessels they had to carry this company were the longboat belonging to the ship and two canoes one of which had been sawn asunder and joined again and these were furnished for their defence with two patararoes the companies small arms and a very scanty proportion of provisions and ammunition and thus equipped they had to sail more than leagues before they reached the river of Santa Martha from whence they were to set out on their march by land for the North Sea Such an enterprize one would imagine could hardly have been undertaken with any hope of succeeding by reasonable men  On April the th they parted with Captain Sharpe leagues to the northwest of the island of Plate and on May the st they landed after many strange adventures in the bay of Panama in order to pursue their journey Here they found the river Santa Martha of which they meant to avail themselves blocked up by a ship of considerable force that had been stationed there for more than six months to intercept  their passage This obliged them to seek a new tract through which however the greatest part of the company with incredible difficulty passed safe to the opposite shore among whom was Dampier whose hardiness enabled him to undergo the severest trials and whose welljudged precautions exempted him from many unnecessary sufferings to which others by their imprudence frequently exposed themselves  On the st of May about three in the afternoon they began their march and on the d they completed their journey in which time they travelled miles crossing some lofty mountains but chiefly keeping along the vallies among deep and dangerous rivers some of which they forded some they passed by felling large trees upon the banks and some they were obliged to swim over in their cloaths and accoutrements Those who could not swim were dragged through by means of ropes Their first landingplace upon the south coast was very disadvantageous to them and forced them to a circuit of miles more than was necessary Could they have landed in the bay of Santa Martha or navigated the river Chepoa by either of which the Indians pass from one shore to the other in three days they might have shortened their journey more than one half  Those however who arrived on the north coast first among whom was Dampier embarked immediately on board a French buccaneer Captain Tristrian Commander who in two days  after they arrived joined eight sail of buccaneers more who were planning another expedition overland to Panama but when they were told of the ill success of the first the fatigues they must undergo the risks they must run and at length the uncertainty of the event they unanimously concurred in relinquishing that design and held a consultation what other enterprize was fit for such a formidable body of them to undertake At length they concluded to attack a Spanish town up Carpenter's river and for that purpose set sail one after another in order to preserve secresy having previously appointed a place of rendezvous When the ship in which our navigator sailed arrived at the place appointed they found Captain Wright there before them who had taken a Spanish Tartan with men well furnished with small arms and four patararoes who with armadillos had been fitted out to seek the buccaneers and to sink them This they that came overland who were heartily tired with living among the French thought a good opportunity to set up for themselves they therefore applied to Captain Wright requesting him to fit up the Tartan for them to which after some hesitation he consented on condition that they should be under his command as one and the same ship to which they made no objection  The rest of th  fleet not arriving at the general rendezvous according to agreement it was soon discovered that the Spanish armadillos or  small men of war had fallen in with and dispersed them Every one therefore was at liberty to pursue his own enterprize and Captain Wright with his new associates chose the coast of Carthagena to try their fortune Here they were joined by Captain Yankey and falling in with a stout ship they fought and took her She proved to be a prize of guns and men laden with sugar and tobacco and had eight or ten tons of marmalet on board The Captains differed about the right to the ship Yankey however took possession by vote of the crews and Captain Wright took Yankey's ship which was better than his own The cargo after a great deal of difficulty they disposed of at a Dutch settlement for less than onefourth of its value  However the goods being now converted into ready money the produce was shared and the Captains parted Captain Wright stood for the Caracca coast with his men drunk and quarrelling every day and Captain Yankey pursued a quite different course On the coast of the Caraccas Captain Wright took three barks one laden with hides one with European commodities and a third with earthenwares and brandy With these barks he went to the island Rocu and having divided the cargoes into three equal parts he gave to every men for they were in all one part and a bark and so dismissed them That in which our navigator had an interest was brought to Virginia on July  where we shall leave both him and the ship to give some account of Captain Yankey  On board of Yankey sailed one Mr Cook as quartermaster the second in command according to buccaneer law and they having taken a prize from the Spaniards the command of the prize was claimed by Mr Cook on board of which all who chose to sail under the new Captain had liberty so to do among others there were several who came overland with him from the South Seas for he too had left Captain Sharpe and had followed the example of Dampier All these chose to follow the fortune of their old acquaintance but the Frenchmen grudging the English the possession of so fine a vessel together with their share of the goods on board her combined together and after plundering them of ship goods arms and money turned them all adrift on the island of Vacca In this destitute condition Captain Tristrian of whom mention has already been made shewed some compassion by taking on board about eight or nine of them among whom were Capt Cook and Captain Davis formerly masters of buccaneers who being carried into Petit Guavres found means when the French crews were carousing on shore to make themselves masters of their benefactor's ship to slip her cable and to steer with all the sail they could spread to Vacca to the relief of their starving countrymen who overjoyed to be released instantly came on board and soon after they set sail had the  good fortune to make prize of a ship laden with wine which was newly come from France They afterwards fell in with a ship of good force of which they likewise made prize and in her they came to the resolution of sailing into the South Seas and ranging the coasts of Chili and Peru But first it was necessary for them to sail to Virginia to dispose of their spare ships and cargoes and to fit their capital prize for war This they did by mounting her with guns and furnishing her with stores provisions and other necessaries for the prosecution of so long a voyage When these ships arrived at Virginia Dampier and all those who came overland with him happened to be there and being made acquainted with Captain Cook's intention they very readily agreed to join in his adventure  And now having followed Dampier through all the busy scenes of action in which he was engaged till his th year we come at length to that period at which the more notable adventures of his life commence  On the th of August he set sail from Achamack river in Virginia in the prize under the command of Captain Cook and on the d they met with a violent tempest which lasted without intermission till the th during which time they shipt some of the heaviest seas that ever ship endured But as soon as the storm abated they had fine weather and a brisk gale till they arrived at the islands of Cape Verd where they staid to careen their ship to refresh  themselves and to take in fresh water This they did at the little island of Sal but being told that the island of Mayo abounded most with cattle they left Sal and went to Mayo to purchase provisions Here they met with a cold reception the inhabitants absolutely refusing to have any traffic with them or to suffer them to land the reason was that about a week before an English ship pretending friendship had cast anchor and by a shew of kindness had invited the Governor with his train on board but as soon as they had them in their power they caused them to write for cattle and other provisions by way of ransom to regain their liberty and what was still more base after they were furnished with what they required they carried off their prisoners who had not then been heard of Dampier afterwards learnt that the Englishman who was guilty of this treachery was Captain Bond who afterwards surrendering himself to the Spaniards entered into their service and taught them to fit out fireships of which they were before totally ignorant in the South Seas  From Mayo they sailed to Sherboro on the coast of Africa where they staid a few days and purchased rice palmwines sugar honey and fowls and then made sail for the straits of Magellan On the th of February they came in sight of the straits mouth but the wind being contrary they continued their course to the south and doubled Cape Horn In latitude when they thought themselves clear of the cape  they encountered a storm on the th of February which lasted without abatement till the d of March during which time the rain poured down immoderately for many days by which however they were plentifully supplied with fresh water  When the storm abated the wind changed to the south and proved very favourable for at this time they found themselves in lat deg S But the gale continuing brisk by the th of March they had run to the height of Baldivia in deg S On the th in the morning they saw a ship to the southward coming after them with all the sail she could croud Supposing her to be a Spanish ship from Baldivia and Lima they lay by for her but on her nearer approach they saw she was an English ship and upon hailing her was told that her Captain's name was Eaton that she came from London and was bound for a cruise in the South Seas  Rogues are always good friends till they come to share their booty so these freebooters agreed to sail together and accordingly kept company to the island of Juan Fernandez where they both prepared to refresh and refit  March they anchored in the south bay in fathoms water not a cable's length from the shore and as soon as Captain Cook's ship was moored Dampier was eager to go ashore to look for a  Moskitoman  whom they had left in this island when they were driven from it in the  year by three Spanish men of war Dampier being at that time in the ship commanded by Captain Watling just after Captain Sharpe was displaced This man when Captain Watling drew off his crew happened to be in the woods hunting for goats and the ship was under sail before he came back Dampier was curious to know whether this Moskitoman was yet alive and if he was how it had fared with him and it seemed that the Indian was no less anxious to enquire after his friends when he saw that the ships that were approaching were English ships The poor fellow had observed them the day before when first they came in sight and judging about what time they would come to an anchor he had killed three goats and gathered greens ready to dress as soon as the company should be at liberty to come on shore He was already upon the beach before the ships could be well secured and was first seen by one of his countrymen who happened to be on board and it was no small pleasure to mark the excessive joy of these two Indians at their meeting The Moskitoman belonging to the ship was named  Robin  he on the island  Will  Robin was the first who leapt on shore and running to Will threw himself flat on his face at his feet who helping him up and embracing him fell flat in like manner with his face at Robin's feet and was by him taken up and embraced as before The surprize the tenderness the solemnity of the interview which was exceedingly  affectionate on both sides was admired even by the crews of buccaneers who were spectators from the ships of what passed on shore When Dampier who was his old friend came up  Will  was no less transported with joy to see him than to meet his countryman but he expressed it in quite another manner other friends too he met with among the crew who knew him and they were all overjoyed at meeting so unexpectedly for these men are very much beloved on board the ships wherever they sail for their readiness to assist in whatever service they are put upon When the ceremonies of congratulation were over and they had time to make enquiries he told them that he was several times sought after by the Spaniards who knew that he was left upon the island because when the ship set sail he was in sight of the shore and was seen by them before he could secrete himself but as he was continually upon the watch and had discovered a safe retreat they never had been able to find him He had with him he said his gun and his knife a small horn of powder and a few shot These being soon spent he contrived a way by notching his knife to saw the barrel of his gun in small pieces with which he made harpoons lanceheads hooks and a long knife heating the pieces first in the fire which he lighted after the English manner by striking his gunflint against the back of his knife The iron when it was hot he hammered with stones and formed it into the various shapes he had occasion to apply it By continued labour  and perseverance he had worked himself such a complete set of instruments for killing and catching his provisions by land and water as surprized the people when they were brought out for their inspection But says Dampier it is no more than these Moskitomen are accustomed to do in their own country where they make their own fishing and striking instruments without either forge or anvil and other Indians are still more ingenious for they make hatchets of a very hard stone with which they cut down trees make canoes and frame their houses  Poor Will had built himself a little house about a mile and a half from the shore which he had made warm and convenient by lining it with goatskins He had likewise raised himself a couch about two feet above the ground which he had also made soft with the fur of the animals he caught and with the down of the young birds for he could catch no other which he occasionally met with and pluckt Cloaths he had none for he had worn them to rags among the bushes and brambles through which he was often obliged to pursue his prey He had been on the island about three years and in all that time had never conversed with any human being He had seen Spaniards but he always took care after the first that none of them should ever see him  At this island these free booters staid sixteen days and on the th of April the two ships set sail together and pursued their course northwards  towards the Line at the distance of or leagues from the shore for fear of being seen The land from deg to deg S is of a most prodigious height with ridges of such lofty mountains from one end of Peru and Chili to the other that their summits seem to rise above the clouds and from the sea they appear for ever blue Dampier attributes to the excessive height of these mountains the want of great rivers in all this tract and says there seldom falls any rain from deg to deg S He adds that the limits of the Pacific Ocean ought to be confined within that space extended westward indefinitely for in all this tract of water says he there are no dark rainy clouds nor any winds but trade winds no tempests no tornadoes or hurricanes though north of the Line they are met with in this Ocean as well as the Atlantic There is however often a thick horizon so as to hinder an observation of the sun with the quadrant and sometimes hazy mornings and thick mists but not such as will wet one The rivers in all this tract he says run small sometimes they run at one season of the year and at others are quite dry These observations if just are truly wonderful  They coasted along the Pacific Ocean from Juan Fernandez to lat deg min S without meeting with any thing worthy of note but on the d of May they fell in with a ship laden with timber which they instantly took without resistance From this ship they learnt  that the Spaniards were apprized of their being upon their coasts and that the Viceroy had sent expresses to all the seaports to put the inhabitants upon their guard against any sudden attack  On this intelligence they immediately altered their course and steered for Lobos de la Mer in lat deg min S Here they cleared their ships bottoms and strictly questioned their prisoners concerning the state of the country and which were the towns of greatest note Several towns were mentioned but Truxillo appeared to be that which if conquered would yield the most profit Truxillo was therefore the place agreed upon to make a descent In their passage they descried three sail Eaton pursued two of those to seaward and Cook presently made prize of that which was nearest the land They were ships laden with flour for Panama in one of which was found a letter from the Viceroy of Lima to the President of Panama acquainting him with enemies being upon the coast and with the supposed strength of their forces They also found an image of the Blessed Virgin in wood and a stately mule being a present to the President with seven or eight tons of marmalate of quinces which is eaten as a great delicacy in that country From the prisoners taken in these prizes they learned that the Spaniards were fortifying Truxillo and that a garrison was already established The attack of that town was therefore judged impracticable and it was resolved to retire to the Gallapagos  with the prizes and there to consult what next was best to be undertaken The Gallapagos are a cluster of islands lying on the Equator very little known or frequented till the buccaneers found their way into the South Seas the nearest of them lies leagues to the westward of the main in long deg W from England For these islands they set sail on the th of May and reached them on the st Here they found plenty of turtle which they feasted upon fresh every day They staid about ten or twelve days and laid up about packs of meal from their prizes to serve as a future supply in case of necessity  Being told by an Indian prisoner that was born at Rio Lexa that there were great riches in his city and that he would shew them the way to the place they concluded to set sail and to trust to the fidelity of their Indian guide intending however to anchor by the way at the island of Cocos in lat deg min S to lodge some of their meal as more convenient to have recourse to on ordinary occasions than the islands of Gallapagos With this intent their stoutest mealship was taken with them but not being able to make the island they steered to the continent  It happened however in the course of this short run that Captain Cook who had been taken ill at Juan Fernandez as soon as he came within a few leagues of Cape Blanco in latitude deg min S suddenly died  "though in the morning says Dampier he was as likely  to live as he had been for a long time before" but he adds "it is usual for sick men coming from the sea to die off as soon as they come within sight of land"  The death of Captain Cook occasioned a general consultation when it was agreed to come to an anchor in Calderabay within a league of Cape Blanco and there to give him christian burial While the men were employed in digging the grave three Indians came up to see what they were about and entered into conversation with the diggers at the same time appearing very shy but notwithstanding their caution as soon as the corps was decently interred they were all three seized at once by the company and very strictly examined They at first pretended to know nothing of the Spaniards but at length they acknowledged that they were sent from Nicoya a town about leagues off to learn what they could concerning any strangers that should touch upon the coast the people of that town having advice that enemies were in the adjoining seas and that therefore it behoved them to be upon their guard They learnt likewise from these Indians that the inhabitants in that neighbourhood were chiefly husbandmen and bred cattle that they traded in hides corn and other provisions for which they received in return shoes hats linen and other cloth and that at no great distance there were some very large cattlepens where they might furnish themselves with as many buffaloes as would fill their ships This was welcome  news to sailors none of whom had tasted any fresh meat for many weeks and a company of of them set out immediately with an Indian for their guide to look for the cattlepens  After a short march of between three and four miles they came in sight of a savannah where a great number of cattle were grazing of which some were for instantly killing as many as they could carry away while others were for staying all night and driving them into the pens to supply the ships at once before the owners were apprized of their design This resolution prevailed but Dampier who was of the party and who never chose to run unnecessary hazards returned to the ships with about half the company together with the Indian guide while the rest chose to stay where they were In the morning when these voluntary drovers were expected to return with their cattle none came it was therefore feared that some disaster had befallen them and boats were manned and sent out to look for them  As the boats were rowing along some of the company happened to spy a number of people upon a rock up to their middles in water and upon nearing them they soon saw that they were the very people they were in search of and therefore hastened to take them on board Lucky it was that the boatmen happened to spy them just as they did for in an hour more they had been all swallowed up by the tide They had been suffered to sleep all night unmolested  Capt  n  Daviss's Men taken off the Rock by their Comrades  and in the morning when they were scattered about among the cattle and driving them into the pens they were surprized by the sudden appearance of about Spanish soldiers well armed who placed themselves in a convenient situation to cut off their retreat Alarmed at this unexpected discovery they hastened to join in a body resolving to sell their lives dear if they found it impossible to make their escape Accordingly they looked well round them in order to discover an opening to some other part of the shore than that against which their ships rode marching at the same time in as good order as their situation would admit and giving the Spaniards nowandthen a volley of shot to keep them at a proper distance The Spaniards who are not over eager to come to a close engagement kept themselves sheltered behind the bushes whistling some random shot at the fugitives by way of return which however did them no harm In this cautious manner they advanced slowly towards the beach where Captain Cook was buried and looking for their boat saw her in flames by the waterside near the spot where they had grounded her the night before All hope of retreat being now cut off and the Spaniards to make sure of their surrender having posted themselves in such a manner as to prevent all communication with the ships they were at length reduced to the last extremity when fortunately spying a rock just above water about yards from the shore  they all determined to commit themselves to the mercy of the ocean rather than fall into the hands of the Spaniards With this resolution they rushed together into the tide holding fast by one another and determining that if one perished all should perish In this manner they made good their landing upon the rock where they had continued seven hours when they happened to be discovered by their comrades who were suffered by the Spaniards to release them without firing a gun  After this disappointment it was thought adviseable not to hazard a second attempt they therefore weighed anchor and continued their course to Ria Lexa having first chosen Mr Edward Davis the next in command to Captain Cook Commander in his room On the th of July they set sail and in three days they were abreast of their intended port  Ria Lexa is known by a highpeaked volcano which smokes all the day and in the night sometimes sends forth flames of fire It lies a considerable distance from the main and before you approach the town there is a small island on which the Spaniards had placed a guard This guard the buccaneers surprized but from them they learnt that the town was strongly fortified that the Governor was informed of their being upon the coast and that the garrison was well provided for defence This news discouraged the adventurers who did not come to fight but to plunder they therefore instantly  withdrew from Ria Lexa and steering for the gulph of Amapalla they there careened their ships and parted company This gulph is a large arm of the sea running ten leagues up into the country On the south point lies Cape Cawina and on the N W St Michael's Mount in lat deg min N But before they came to the gulph it was agreed that Captain Davis should go before with two canoes wellmanned in order by surprising some of the natives to gain intelligence Accordingly as soon as they approached the gulph the canoes departed and Captain Davis the first night arrived at a small island on which there was a town called Mangera which for want of a guide he could not find In the morning he found it but the Indian inhabitants had all fled and left the place deserted only the padre with two boys to attend him were left to take their fate As all that Captain Davis wanted was a prisoner for the sake of information one more intelligent than the friar could not have fallen into his hands From him they learnt that there were several Indian villages in the gulph but that there were only three towns that had churches that he served all the three that there was only another white man besides himself in the whole gulph who was a kind of secretary to the Spanish government and who collected the revenues and kept the accompts  Captain Davis upon receiving this intelligence taking with him the friar and his two  boys ventured to approach Amapalla which stands upon an eminence As Davis with his men gained the ascent the Secretary attended by the Casique or Indian Chief demanding in Spanish who they were and from whence they came was answered by Davis that they were Biscayers and that they were sent thither by the King of Spain to clear the seas from enemies that their ships were foul and were coming there to clean and that he was come before to prepare a convenient station and to demand assistance from his Majesty's Indian subjects The Secretary bid him welcome said he loved an Old Spain man and gave him and his followers a kind invitation to come and take their residence in the town Captain Davis ascended the hill placing the friar in the front They were received with every possible mark of respect both by the Secretary and the Indian inhabitants and after the first salutations were past they were conducted to the church where all business of a public nature is transacted Accordingly the friar entered first and was followed by Captain Davis and most of the bystanders but one or two or the Indians loitering behind were pushed in by Davis's men who then suspecting some mischief sprung back again and all the rest of the Indians taking the alarm followed their example leaving Davis and the friar looking at one another in high consternation ignorant as posts of the cause that had occasioned the desertion while at the same  time the brutes who had caused the revolt were firing upon the poor Indians for flying and in the skirmish the Secretary was kill'd upon the spot the only person in all the gulph that could speak Spanish the friar and his two boys excepted  Davis's design was when they were all in the church to have shut them in and made his own terms with them but poor wretches there was no need to practice farther treachery with them for notwithstanding the brutality of these pretended Biscayers the Indians shewed them every kind of civility helped them to repair their ships hewed down timber for them and brought it to the docks furnished them with cattle and fresh provisions from the main and assisted them in filling water and carrying wood aboard All this while the friar with his two lads were kept prisoners and it was feared when they were ready to sail that they would have carried them off for the Indians had a great veneration for their priest He had learned their language and was very useful to them both by his kind offices and admonitions  They remained here from the latter end of July till the d of September when they set the friar and his youths on shore and the two Captains or more properly the two crews having quarrelled they parted as has already been said and each of them pursued a different course Davis steered along the main of Peru till having ranged the whole coast of South America they came to the island of Plata in  lat deg min S so called by the Spaniards after Drake had shared the plunder of the Cacafuego upon it Captain Eaton steered a contrary course till being in want of water he chose the island of Plate to supply his necessities Here the two ships came unexpectedly to the same harbour when Captain Eaton proposed a reconciliation which Davis or rather his crew rejected Capt Eaton's men reported that they had met in their course with dreadful tornadoes with thunder and lightning frightful to the last degree that the air smelt of sulphur and that they every moment expected to be involved in smoke and flame Captain Eaton's terms being rejected he staid but one night and the day following Davis left the island and attempted the little town of Manta about seven or eight leagues from Plata They found the place deserted and brought away an old woman the only living creature they found in the place She informed them that a great many strangers were come overland from the north seas that they were yet in canoes and periagoes and that the Viceroy had commanded all the Spanish trading ships on the coast to be burnt to prevent their falling into the enemies hands On this news Davis retired again to the island of Plata to wait the event where soon after an English ship arrived called the Cygnet commanded by Captain Swan This ship had been fitted out by some merchants of London with a view to trade but all trade being effectually at a stop  Swan was easily persuaded to put his goods up to auction among the adventurers with whom he accidentally fell in to man his ship with them and to turn buccaneer himself The new comers were headed by a Captain Harris who contented himself for the present to command a small bark under Captain Swan There was great joy at this meeting and Captain Davis and Captain Swan were like other rogues very fond of each other for their own villainous purposes They now wished for Captain Eaton again that having men enough they might all unite and undertake some place of consequence With this view they fitted up a small bark and dispatched her in pursuit of him appointing a place of rendezvous if the bark should be fortunate enough to meet with him In the mean time they set sail directing their course to Payta a small town in lat deg min S built under a rock near the seaside In their way they fell in with a large ship of tons laden with timber by whom they received intelligence that the Viceroy had ordered frigates to be fitted up with all expedition in order to drive them out of those seas  "Captain Davis's unsettled crew says Dampier began now heartily to repent their not accepting of Captain Eaton's terms"  However they pursued their course and on the d of November landed in the road of Payta and next morning attempted the town which they found deserted and not so much as one day's provisions left in the whole place  Here they got intelligence that Captain Eaton had burnt a ship in that road the week before and was sailed to the westward by which they judged that he had taken his departure for the East Indies by which course it was always his intention to return home They therefore began to prepare for their defence in case of being attacked by the Spanish frigates They burnt Captain Harris's bark because she was a heavy sailor and fitted up another small bark for a fireship and having examined their powder and ammunition and overhauled their rigging and put every thing in the best order they could they made sail for the isles of Lobos At Lobos they found a letter left by the bark that was sent in quest of Captain Eaton acquainting them that he had been there but had sailed some days before the arrival of the bark and that the bark was gone to Plata the place of rendezvous Here it was concerted to attempt the town of Guaiaquil before they returned to Plata Accordingly on the th in the morning they set sail from Lobos steering directly for the bay of Guaiaquil This bay runs in between Cape Blanco on the south side and Point Shanday on the north leagues from Cape Blanco In the bottom of this bay lies the island of Santa Clara in the form of a corpse laid out in a shroud of which the east end represents the head and the west end the feet Ships that are bound to the port of Guaiaquil keep to the southward of this isle to avoid the shoals on  the north side where it is reported a very rich wreck lies sunk and that a person who came from the King of Spain with a patent to fish for wrecks had taken up some of the plate but he dying the patent expired without much effect The Indians however have taken some by stealth and would probably have got much more but for the swarms of catfish that hover round this island the prick of whose fins is so poisonous that whenever they draw blood the wound proves mortal From Santa Clara to Puna Arona is about seven leagues on which island the inhabitants who are all seamen or fishermen are obliged to keep constant watch and to give notice to the Governor of Guiaquil of the approach of all shipping whether friends or foes The houses in the town of Puna stand upon posts or feet high with ladders on the outsides to ascend the rooms Dampier says he never saw any such in any other part of the world except among the Malayans in the East Indies They are thatched with palmeto leaves and their chambers well boarded in which they exceed the Malayans From Puna to Guiaquil is seven leagues and at the distance of one league from the entrance of the river which rises about two miles on the other side Guiaquil it is divided into two streams one stream leading to Leon the other to Guiaquil Guiaquil according to Dampier is one of the principal seaports in the South Seas The commodities exported from that city are cocoa  hides tallow sarsaparilla and other drugs and woollencloth commonly called Quitocloth This cloth which is made at the rich inland town of Quito is worn by all the common people throughout the kingdom of Peru But besides cloth Quito abounds with gold wash'd down from the mountains that surround it which the Indians make a trade of gathering in the adjacent brooks where it is sometimes found in solid lumps but generally in small dust mix'd with sand  As soon as the ships entered the bay they cast anchor off Cape Blanco and the crews manned their boats and small barks to advance with the more secresy towards the town In their way they made prize of a small vessel laden with Quitocloth the master of which told them of the watch at Puna and at the same time acquainted them that three ships were expected to sail from Guiaquil next tide with negro slaves They had not rowed far before they fell in with one of the ships laden with negroes and took her They cut her mainmast down and left her at anchor The next day they made prize of the other two but in taking them they alarmed the town and there being no discipline observed no Commander in Chief to lead them on in a body one party counteracted the other party so that none of their attacks took place Captain Davis advanced with a party of his men till they were quite exhausted in marching thro' swamps and mangroves Captain Swan and most of his men were for retreating seeing the  town alarmed but being upbraided with cowardice agreed to proceed They had two Indian guides and one of them undertook to lead the way into the town and was followed by a Davis's man who was fastened to him by a rope to prevent his making his escape But a little before they came within musketshot Davis's man who had boasted of his courage and sought the post of honour to be next man to the guide cut the string and let the guide loose who finding himself at liberty took to his heels and made his escape The other when he saw him out of reach cried out that somebody had cut the string and that the guide was gone This spread a general panic so the design was all at once defeated for after that not a man would advance a step farther but all retired to their boats and embarked without either firing a gun or having a gun fired at them After looking at the town for half an hour they departed and having drest a cow and filled their bellies they fell down the bay with the tide rifled the negroships and took about forty of the stoutest men along with them and turned the rest adrift Dampier remarks upon this miscarriage that there never was a fairer opportunity for men to enrich themselves than they had but all their golden dreams vanished at once and they returned as they went directing their course to Plata to meet the bark sent in search of Captain Eaton  When they arrived they found her with her crew almost famished for having sought the  ships at Lobos and from Lobos to Plata and from Plata to Lobos again without finding them and having scarce days provisions on board when they set out they were constrained to make a descent upon the village of Santa Helena where they succeeded and got a small quantity of maize with which and the turtle they happened to strike and some boobies and penguins they killed they had made shift to subsist though with the utmost difficulty Such was the regard these plunderers bore for each other when projects of robbery were in view Here the cargo of the clothbark the only booty they had made was shared by lots and Captain Swan had the bark to serve him as a tender Here also according to custom they quarrelled Captain Davis's men placing the miscarriage to the cowardice of Captain Swan's and Captain Swan's to the overforwardness of Captain Davis's At length the matter was compromised by the mediation of the two Commanders and they agreed in the next place to attack Lavelia a pretty large town in the bay of Panama about seven leagues from the seaside on the banks of a river on the northside of the bay  On this expedition they set sail the d of December On the th they arrived at a small village called Tomaco which they surprized and took and in it a Spanish Knight Don Diego de Pinas who came in a Ship from Lima to load timber in which ship there were only eight Spaniards and twelve or thirteen jars of good old wine The wine they seized but let the ship go  On the st of January in passing from Tomaco to Gallo they took a packet boat from Panama to Lima with letters The Spaniards threw the letters overboard but there being a string and a small buoy to the box in which they were inclosed the box was seen and taken up The contents of the public dispatches were that the armada from Old Spain were arrived at Porto Bello and that the President of Panama had received orders to hasten the Plate fleet from Lima  This was joyful news for the buccaneers who now thought of nothing but sharing the treasures of Peru They laid aside their pitiful project upon Lavelia and concluded to careen their ships at the King's Isles near the entrance of the gulph of Panama to which gulph no ships could sail without being seen from these isles There were now two ships and three barks in company a fireship and two small tenders They all changed their course and steered for the isles in their way to which they took a ship of tons laden with flour On the d of January they arrived at the place appointed and on the th they cast anchor in the harbour of Galleria setting all hands to work to clean the barks in order to cruise in the channel till the next springtide when the large ships might be laid up to be cleaned also  On the th the barks being finished were sent to cruise in the entrance of the gulph and on the th day after they brought in a prize  laden with corn saltbeef and fowls The beef and fowls came in good time The th of February they made an end of careening their large ships took in wood and water and on the th sailed into the channel to cruise for the platefleet When they came abreast of Old Panama they sent their Knight upon his parole with a letter to the President to treat for the exchange of prisoners but by some accident says Dampier he was killed The next day they sent another letter to the President by a  Mestiso  a mixed breed half Indian half Spaniard This letter produced the desired effect The English prisoners were released and about Spaniards were returned in their room  Leaving Panama they cast anchor before Tobago and while they lay in that road a stratagem was played upon them that was near proving fatal to men and ships A pretended merchant from Panama came by stealth to trade with them for such merchandize as they might have on board a thing not uncommon on those coasts and was well received It was agreed that in the night he should send his bark out with such commodities as they wanted and take back such as they had to return Accordingly the bargain was made and the bark came out as was expected hailing the ships with the watchword that was to be her security Being cautious however lest some mischief should be intended they called to the people on board the bark to cast anchor which they not regarding  were instantly fired at upon which the crew took to their canoes and set fire to the pretended smuggling ship which had been prepared as a fireship by that Capt Bond who carried off the officers from Mayo as has been already related in the beginning of the voyage This was aimed chiefly at Captain Davis's ship but at the same time Captain Swan's people observed a small float on the water with something like a man in it making towards their ship the man seeing he was discovered dived and the float disappeared this they apprehended when they saw the fireship blow up was some combustible matter intended to be struck to the rudder of Swan's ship as was formerly attempted upon that of Captain Sharpe's in the harbour of Coquimbo Both ships however were glad to cut their cables and it was with difficulty that Davis's escaped The fireship drove burning towards Tobago but after the first explosion she did not burn clear only made a smother not being properly contrived  This Bond who instructed the Spaniards in making her after he left the Cape de Verd isles as has already been related steered for the South Seas and in his passage meeting with Captain Eaton Bond's pilot Richard Morton by name persuaded him to join with Eaton and to make the voyage conjointly but after they had sailed in company two days Morton took an opportunity to slip on board Eaton and persuaded him to drop Bond which  he did in the night Morton still continuing on board with Eaton Bond being thus deserted and having no navigator with him who had ever been in the South Seas and having been scouted for malpractices in the North Seas had no other resource but that of betraying his countrymen's designs to ingratiate himself with the Spaniards With this view he steered directly for Porto Bello surrendered himself and crew to the Governor informing him of the buccaneer's designs in the South Seas and offering to remain himself as surety for the truth of what he said The Governor not doubting the fact entertained him and sent him over to the Viceroy of Lima to be employed by him as he should think fit and he proved a very useful instrument in defeating the enterprizes of his old companions  But to proceed In the morning when it was light the ships returned to their buoys to fish up their anchors and while they were thus employed they were alarmed by a multitude of canoes and periagoes that were in motion all round the island They seemed to make directly towards the ships and when they came within call the people on board learnt that they were a new company of English and French invaders just arrived from the North Seas to try their fortune along with the old and were headed by two captains one Grenet the other Lequie that they consisted of French and the rest English and that English more  were still on the isthmus under the command of Captain Townley and were daily expected to arrive in order to join the rest All the Englishmen were immediately taken on board Captain Davis and Captain Swan and the French were accommodated with the flour prizes of which mention has already been made and Captain Grenet as the eldest officer was made choice of to command his countrymen In a few days Captain Townley arrived having already made himself master of two ships one laden with flour the other with wine brandy and oil the prisoners they took in these ships declared that the fleet from Lima was ready to sail Soon after the arrival of Capt Townley there came a canoe out of the river of Santa Martha who said there were men more on the isthmus of Darien in their way to these seas On the th they fell in with a bark with five or six Englishmen in her that belonged to Captain Knight who had been six months in the South Seas and was now upon the coast of Mexico where he came in sight of this bark but not being able to come up with her in his ship had sent the men that were found in her in a canoe to make prize of her who having succeeded had lost company in the night and could not recover their ship again This bark Captain Swan took under his care on pretence that the men had run away and left their Commander and gave her to Captain Harris who presently manned her  The time approached when the Lima fleet was expected and some letters were intercepted that contained the instructions to the commanders which course to steer In consequence whereof the captains of the buccaneers held a consultation in what manner to steer in order to intercept them but while they were yet undetermined word was brought that the Spanish fleet was advancing and as it should seem to give them battle This news was by no means agreeable Such a motley crew of common plunderers were but ill suited to stand a regular engagement However there was now no alternative either they must fight or run away in which case being taken singly they probably would all be destroyed but by fighting some might chance to escape The Spaniards were in number of which the Admiral carried guns and men the Viceadmiral guns men the Rearadmiral guns men one ship of guns men one of guns men and one of eight guns men two fireships six ships with only small arms some periagoes and tenders having eight hundred men among them all  The English who were to engage this formidable squadron consisted of ten sail Captain Davis's ship of guns men mostly English Captain Swan guns men all English these were the only ships of force the others being furnished with none but small  arms Captain Townley had men all English Captain Grenet men all French Captain Harris men most English Captain Branley men some English some French Davis's tender eight men Swan's tender eight men Townley's bark eighty men and a small bark of thirty tons made into a fireship with a canoe's crew in her in all men The English notwithstanding the superiority of the enemy resolved to begin the attack having the advantage of the weather gage which gave them the choice either to fight or run Accordingly about three in the afternoon they bore down right before the wind on the enemy who kept close upon a wind to meet them but night came on without any thing material being done on either side  When it grew dark the Spanish Admiral put forth a light as a signal for the fleet to cast anchor and presently hoisted a light on his top which after continuing there an hour was taken down and in a little time hoisted again The English being still to windward were not aware of this stratagem for the Spaniard knowing of what consequence it was to gain the weather gage hoisted the second light upon the topmast of one of his barks and edged away silently himself followed by his capital ships and as soon as it was daylight appeared to windward of the English This was an unexpected stroke and left them no other course to take but to fly  Captain Townley being hard pressed by the enemy made a bold push through a narrow gut that parted the isles and was followed by several of the smaller ships by which they escaped Captain Harris was chaced to the westward and returned no more And Captain Davis maintained a running fight all day round the bay of Panama with the loss only of a single man At night the Spaniards gave over the pursuit and suffered the English to rendezvous at the same islands from whence they sailed the day before to begin the attack  The th the Spaniards without pursuing their victory continued their course to Panama and the English having lost Captain Harris in the engagement as has just now been mentioned set sail to the keys of Quibo in search of him that being the place appointed to rendezvous in case of being dispersed Here they cashiered their cowardly French Captain who never came into the engagement at all and having found Captain Harris they held a consultation about their futu  e operations  All their hopes being now frustrated of effecting any thing considerable by sea they turned their thoughts on making their fortunes by land and for that purpose their prisoners were all strictly examined with regard to the strength and riches of the principal cities along the seacoast and within or miles within land  On the th of July they were joined by Captain Knight of whom mention has already  been made He had been cruising more than six months and had got nothing except a good ship He expected to have found the fleet at King's Islands enriched with the treasures of the Spanish fleet but when he came there he was informed by the master of a barklog which he took that they were worsted and had fled to the westward where he had now come to join them  In order more effectually to pursue their inland enterprizes they set about providing canoes for navigating the rivers that led to the chief cities against which they had formed designs and on the th of July they sailed from Quibo bending their course for Ria Lexa the nearest port to Leon the city they determined first to attack Their whole force consisted of men in eight ships commanded by the Captains Davis Swan Townley and Knight with a fireship and three tenders  Being arrived within eight leagues of the shore they quitted their ships and embarked to the number of men in canoes and after a dangerous passage in which they met with two dreadful tornadoes and in which the large canoes were very near sinking they arrived at length at the creek that leads to Leon and advancing within five miles of the city without the loss of a man they landed to the number of leaving the remainder under the command of Dampier to guard the canoes  They marched from the boats in three divisions Captain Townley with of the briskest men led the van Captain Swan with men followed next to support him Captain Davis headed the main body consisting of men and Captain Knight with the remainder composed the rear Captain Townley who had advanced more than two miles ahead of the rest met a party of Spanish horsemen and defeated them Encouraged by this success his men pushed briskly on and entered the town driving all before them When they had gained the highstreet they were opposed by the main body of the Spaniards drawn up on the parade in order of battle but on two or three of their principal officers being killed they were soon dispersed and Captain Townley had made himself master of the city before the foremost division that was to support him had entered the suburbs About six in the evening the rearguard came straggling in many of the men who composed it being tired and unable to keep pace with the rest came dropping in all night and one old man was killed next morning by the Spaniards from whom he refused to accept of quarter He fired his piece among them reserving his pistols to defend himself when he should come to close engagement but they returned his fire and shot him dead at a distance He was a stout greyheaded old man aged about and had served under Oliver in the time of the Irish Rebellion after which he entered on  board a ship and sailed to Jamaica where he had followed buccaneering for many years He could not be prevailed on to tarry with the canoes but said he would venture as far as the boldest man among them He was much regretted being a cheerful old man and never dispirited  The Spaniards likewise picked up another straggler one Mr Smith a merchant who had accompanied Capt Swan with an intent to trade when that gentleman took in his cargo at London for the South Seas This gentleman was carried before the Governor of Leon who was encamped at some distance from the town and was examined by him concerning the number of the invaders Being known to a Mulatto servant that attended the Governor he was the more easily credited when he told him that they were strong in the town and that were left to guard the canoes This information had its effect for the Governor who was assembling the force of the country to fall upon the assailants sent next day a flag of truce with an offer to ransom the city They demanded pieces of eight and provisions for men for four months The demand it is probable exceeded the Governor's abilities so that he was obliged to suffer the city to be set on fire because he could not comply with their exorbitant demands In the mean time Mr Smith being exchanged for a lady that had fallen into the hands of the invaders and a Spanish gentleman  released upon promise of sending them oxen to Ria Lexa the next town they intended to assault they left Leon in flames and returned to their canoes It does not appear that the plunder of Leon answered the expectations of the assailants Be that as it may they prowled down the river stealing cattle or any thing that fell in their way and on the th of June reached Ria Lexa in the harbour of which the ships were already arrived The Spaniards for their better defence had thrown up an intrenchment at the mouth of a narrow creek leading to the town and had placed soldiers to defend it they had besides thrown a boom across the river to prevent either ships or boats from advancing up the channel so that these men might have maintained their posts against an army of regulars But when the English came in sight of the breastwork they fired but two guns before the Spaniards run away They were about half an hour in cutting the boom and the channel being now clear they entered the town without farther opposition Here they found nothing but empty houses except such things as the inhabitants could not or would not carry away these were about sacks of flour some pitch tar and cordage all which though things of little value to the Spaniards were notwithstanding of great use to them They therefore conveyed them aboard the ships and having here received the beeves the ransom of the gentleman released  on his parole at Leon some were employed in killing and salting while others made excursions to the neighbouring farms and sugarworks from whence they rarely returned empty handed  They staid here from the th to the th  "when some of our destructive crew to use Dampier's own words set fire to the houses I know not by whose order but we marched away and left them burning"  The th the Captains Davis and Swan agreed to part company They had hitherto been unsuccessful in concert they therefore determined to try their fortunes separately Knight and Harris accompanied Davis and Townley with his two barks followed Captain Swan  In a few days Davis set sail for the coasts of Peru but Capt Swan after staying to take in wood and water and to recover his men pursued his course to the westward intending first to examine the country of Mexico towards the north and then to steer for the EastIndies and by that course to return home This was a very flattering voyage for Dampier who was no less earnest to store his mind with the knowledge of new countries than to enlarge his fortune by the riches they contained he therefore quitted Davis and entered on board with Captain Swan  On the d of September they set their prisoners and pilots on shore the latter being of no farther use and the former only an incumbrance A malignant fever continued to rage on board  which carried off many of their men As the same distemper broke out in the fleet of Captain Davis it was concluded that they had taken the infection at Ria Lexa where a few months before their arrival the inhabitants had been visited by a kind of plague which had almost depopulated the town They had still however about men in tolerable health in four ships  In their course to the northwestward they met with most tempestuous weather violent tornadoes from the northeast almost every day with such flashes of lightning and claps of thunder as no man on board had ever heard  On the th they came in sight of the wellknown volcano of Guatimala which appears at first with a double peak Between these peaks fire and smoke with dreadful roarings frequently break forth and spread the alarm far and wide yet the inhabitants of Guatimala continue to reside near the foot of the mountain and are not so much intimidated upon those occasions as those who live at a greater distance This city is famous for many rich commodities the produce of the neighbouring hills and savannas among which it is situated It lies about eight leagues from the South Sea and by report not above or fifty leagues from the north to which it sends annually great quantities of indico anatta silvester and cochineal The indico plant grows wild about Guatimala and has lately been introduced and cultivated in Georgia and Carolina The anatta is a red dye and is  made from the flowers of a shrub which grows in many of the southern provinces of America Silvester is the seeds of a fruit not unlike the prickly pear of England and cochineal is a collection of insects bred in fruit of the same shape and size Both the trees grow wild about Guatimala and both the silvester and cochineal yield the same kind of dye and are sometimes substituted one for the other though the cochineal is generally accounted the most valuable  The volcano of Guatimala is seen at miles distance and the sea as they approached it was full of floating pumice stones washed by the rains from the adjacent hills and precipitated by the floods into the main ocean where by a constant accumulation they cover an immense space Driftwood they likewise observed in great abundance and the trees were large and not much rotted  When they had reached the latitude of Toguantabeque in deg min N Capt Townley with men in nine canoes attempted to land but found the country defended by huge sandy hills against which the waves beat high with incredible fury The wind being fair he coasted along the shore for several days and the ships continued to follow him with an easy sail at length grown desperate he rushed upon a sandy beach but the canoes overset before they could reach the land In this attempt one or two men perished some had a leg or an arm broke and others were very much hurt However the majority having made good their landing  dragged afterwards their boats on shore but what gave them the greatest concern was that all but those who had been provident enough to seal up their cartouch boxes had wetted their powder and rendered their firearms useless This gave a damp to their enterprize yet they prepared to penetrate the country and to get sight of the town of which they were in search but either there was no such place or their fears prevented their discovering it for all that were alive returned on board the ships without procuring a meal's provisions to refresh the sick  After this fruitless expedition they still continued coasting to the westward with the wind at eastnortheast till they came to Tangola a small island where there was good anchorage from thence they sailed to Guatulco a sea port in lat deg min N the best in Mexico On one side of the entrance into this harbour there is a small island and on the other a hollow rock through which the billows as they pass produce a horrible roaring and being compressed against the sides are forced through a hole at the top and rise like the waters of an artificial fountain to an incredible height In this harbour there is good anchorage It is about three miles in depth and one in breadth runs in northwest and on the westside small ships may ride landlocked secure from wind or weather At the bottom of this harbour Drake found a fine rivulet of water near a village of which hardly any traces remained except the ruins of  a small chapel enclosed in a fine grove of trees that gave it a very venerable appearance Here the sick on board the ships were brought ashore and here a project was formed to traverse the country and plunder the inland towns but after travelling miles and seizing two or three Indian guides they could only find a little village where some vanellos were drying the cods of which are held in great esteem by the Spaniards They grow upon vines that creep like ivy about trees of greater magnitude and flourish in the bay of Campeachy as well as in the country of Guatalco but the Indians keep the method of curing them a secret to themselves The Indians of this village could speak but little Spanish appeared to be a poor harmless people had neither gold nor silver among them nor could they tell where those precious metals were to be obtained It was therefore to no purpose to pursue their march through a country rich indeed in natural productions but destitute of cultivation and almost without inhabitants they therefore returned to their ships and while the sick were endeavouring to regain their strength the healthy employed themselves in providing necessaries to continue the voyage  On the th four canoes well manned set forwards to the port of Angels with orders to wait there till the arrival of the ships In the mean time their instructions were to take some prisoners  On the th the malignity of the distemper with which they had been long afflicted being abated and the sick in a fair way of recovery the ships set sail in order to follow the boats The boats however had mistaken the harbour and two of them in attempting to land at a place near which they had observed some cattle feeding were overset in the beach and with difficulty got out again to sea with the loss of one man drowned and some others hurt They lost likewise four of their guns and spoiled their ammunition and in a very distressed condition the next day met the ships The other two canoes parted from them in the night of the th and had not rejoined them since The harbour of Port Angels lies in latitude deg N and is open to all winds except those from the land The Spaniards had compared it to that of Guatulco but there being no similitude the boats had passed it without knowing it and the two that were missing had rowed as far as Acapulco before they discovered their mistake When the ships arrived before the harbour the missing boats were ready to join them and there appearing to be plenty of cattle at no great distance from the shore men were landed to supply the ships with beef  The country round this harbour exhibited a most delightful prospect the hills were covered with large and lofty trees the plains with a most beautiful verdure and the savannas interspersed with rills and rivers on the banks of which were  innumerable little shrubs the beauty and variety of whose flowers surpass description Here they made no doubt of being furnished with whatever their wants required In less than four miles march the party that were landed met with a grazing seat belonging to Don Diego de la Rosa in which they found store of salt and a considerable quantity of maize but no inhabitants the family having fled on the first appearance of a descent They found also poultry in abundance and hogs or cabritos without number Here they feasted for two or three days and every man brought away as much as he could carry but the ruggedness of the road and the weakness of the company debilitated by sickness prevented their improving so favourable an opportunity to the best advantage They relinquished with reluctance many good things which they had in possession more than sufficient for present enjoyment but too cumbersome to be conveyed to the ships for future use  In the harbour of Port Angels there is good riding in and fathom water The flood rises about five feet sets to the northeast and the ebb at souchwest  The th in the morning they set sail from Port Angels and in the evening came to an anchor in fathom water under a small rocky island six leagues to the westward of their former station of which island the Spanish books give no account The next day they weighed and continued their course and being abreast  of a small lagune whence the missing boats had a few days before taken a quantity of fish they lay to and sent in a boat with men to bring off a more ample supply The Spaniards on marking the trim of the ships suspected their intent and concealing themselves behind a rock at the narrow entrance of the lagune discharged a volley of small arms at the boat just as it passed the place of their ambuscade by which five of the crew were dangerously wounded Alarmed at this sudden attack and finding it impossible to retreat because of the narrowness of the channel they pushed forwards into the lagune where they could lie out of gunshot till the enemy dispersed or till they should be relieved by the vigilance and valour of their own people In this situation however they continued two days and three nights till at length Captain Townley fearing some disaster had befallen them manned his canoes and beating the Spaniards from the rocks opened the sufferers a free passage to the sea Their joy was the greater as the pains of the wounded men began to grow intolerable and had they not then been relieved they must in another day nay some of them perhaps in a few hours have died in the greatest agonies This lagune lies in latitude deg min N  On the d of November they passed by a remarkable rock called by the Spaniards the Algatross five or six miles to the westward of which are seven or eight white cliffs that serve  to direct mariners to avoid a dangerous shoal stretching about a league and a half southbywest A little farther to the westward the Spaniards have erected a breastwork upon a small island at the mouth of a fair river which at that time was defended by men They manned their boats and being determined to land the Spaniards after firing or shot deserted the island and left the channel open They entered on the west side and found plenty of salt laid up in cabbins for curing the fish which they catch in the lagunes but in what manner Dampier could not conceive for he neither saw hook line net boat or canoe At the distance of three leagues from the entrance of the river they came to a house in which was a Mulatto servant who informed them that at Acapulco there was a stout ship from Lima and that a little higher up the river there was maize and cattle in abundance to which place he offered to be their guide  On this intelligence a contention arose between the commanders Captain Townley who was in want of a better ship proposed to sail immediately to Acapulco to make himself master of that from Lima but Captain Swan was first for procuring provisions to enable them to subsist while they were pursuing the grand object they had in view that of intercepting the Manilla ship which every year comes constantly from the East Indies richly laden and arrives nearly at a certain season off the southermost point of California in her course to Acapulco  As questions of this kind are always decided by numbers among voluntary adventurers Captain Townley's proposal was not only seconded by his own crew but also by the greatest part of Captain Swan's They accordingly returned to the ships with all expedition and set sail on the th and on the th came in sight of the high land of Acapulco a port easy to be distinguished from all others by means of three hills the middlemost of which rises like a sugar loaf and the westermost of the other two has on its summit two hillocks which shew in appearance like two paps When the ships came to the distance of about leagues they brought to and Captain Townley with men embarked on board canoes with a view to seize the Lima ship by surprize before his own ships should come in sight  They had hardly sailed four leagues before there arose so dreadful a tornado that those on board the ships thought themselves in the utmost peril of their lives and every one concluded that the boats must perish Happily however they weathered the storm but were driven in great distress into Port Marquis a tolerable harbour about a league to the eastward of Acapulco Here they staid to dry their cloaths and refit their furniture and in the night of the following day they rowed softly into Acapulco harbour  "and because they would not be heard" says Dampier "they hauled in their oars and paddled as softly as if they had been seeking  manatee They paddled close to the castle then struck over to the town and found the ship riding between the breastwork and the fort about yards from each When they had well viewed her and considered the danger of the design they thought it impossible to accomplish it therefore they paddled softly back again till they were out of command of the forts and then they attempted to land but were opposed by a company of Spanish soldiers who fired at them and kept them at a distance from the shore till daylight when taking a view of the town and castle and not liking their appearance they returned on board tired hungry and heartily mortified at their disappointment"  Acapulco lies in deg N on the westside of the continent of America famous for its trade to the East Indies and to Lima in which trade three ships are annually employed two of them are so regulated that each has the advantage of the tradewinds that blow between the Tropics both in going and returning to their respective ports The third is employed in supplying the other two with Spanish goods from Lima and in bringing to Lima the Indian merchandize and money brought from Manilla  On the th the ships sailed from Acapulco and continued coasting along the shore to the westward Near the seaside the land is low but rises gradually till within land it appears to  touch the clouds Though the ground is clean and the anchorage good at a mile from land yet it is defended by breakers that render the shore inaccessible except at the utmost hazard of men's lives In their passage observing a cluster of little round hills a little to the westward of the promontory of Petaplan in deg min N they examined the coast narrowly and discovered a small river at the entrance of which they landed men who after marching about miles up the country came to a wretched Indian village in which a Mulatto woman and four children were the only living creatures left These they brought to the ships and by the intelligence they received from the old woman they proceeded to the harbour of Chequetan from whence she conducted them through a pathless wood to a farmhouse where they found a caravan of sixty mules laden with flour chocolate and cheese all which together with some oxen they brought down to their canoes The cargo of the caravan they instantly conveyed on board the ships but the oxen with eighteen cows which they afterwards seized without opposition they first killed and cured and having divided the whole into lots every ship's crew took their own share on board  On the st they quitted this fortunate harbour leaving the Mulatto and her four children to their fate On the th they passed a lofty hill divided into peaks in lat deg min N  Dampier's Comrades seizing the Oxen Mules laden with Flour Cheese c at a Farm House  near which the Spanish maps place a town called Cupan which however they could not find after a short stay in search of it they proceeded along the coast till on the th they came in sight of the volcano of Colima in lat deg min N at the foot of which is situated the rich town of Colima from whence it takes its name Of the valley by which this burning mountain is surrounded the Spaniards give a most luxuriant description but our navigators found it absolutely inaccessible from the sea for the surf ran so high and the breakers appeared so formidable that the boldest of them durst not attempt it they therefore very reluctantly quitted the neighbourhood and proceeded in quest of Sallagua the bay of which they discovered in lat deg min N Here they landed of their best men who were opposed by a body of Spanish foot supported by a party of horse but on the first charge the foot gave way and the horse soon followed In the pursuit the English were led into a broad road and followed it through a woody and rocky country to the distance of four or five leagues without seeing house or inhabitants In their way back they met with two straggling Mulattoes who told them the road led to the city of Oarrah four days journey off and the soldiers whom they had defeated were sent from thence to escort the passengers from India that were expected to land in Sallagua bay from on board the  Manilla ship that every year touched upon that coast  Encouraged by this intelligence they hastened to embark and setting sail on the th of December steered directly for Cape Corientes at the height of which they expected to meet their prize In this passage Dampier who had hitherto by temperance preserved his health was seized with a fever and ague which at length terminated in a dropsical disorder that was very near carrying him off and which carried off many of the men The dropsy Dampier says is a general disorder on this coast and the natives pretend that the stone of the alligator dried and powdered and drank in water is an infallible remedy The same receipt he found mentioned in a Mexican almanac but could find no alligator to give it a trial  On the th of December they came in sight of Cape Corientes It is of a moderate height flat and even at top cloathed with woods and projecting into the sea in steep cliffs It is laid down in the Spanish maps in latitude deg min N and longitude deg min W from Teneriff or in deg min W from the Lizardpoint in England  They were now four ships in company Captain Swan and his tender and Captain Townley and his tender These were all properly stationed to gain intelligence but provisions growing short Captain Townley's bark was dispatched with men to traverse the coast to the westward  of the Cape in search of some town or village where their wants might be supplied On the th the bark returned being unable to weather the cape or make any useful discovery She had left however four canoes with men who determined to double the cape or perish in the attempt  On the th all the ships quitted their stations and sailed for the island of Chametley about or leagues to the eastward of the cape to take in wood and water On these islands live the fishermen who as the Spaniards say fish for the inhabitants of the city of Purification On the th they anchored between the islands and the main in five fathom water clear sand Here they caught plenty of rockfish but saw no inhabitants On the st Captain Townley with about men went to an Indian village about seven or eight leagues to the westward to endeavour to procure provisions and next day Captain Swan returned to his station off the cape On the th the four canoes who had doubled the cape returned to the cruisers and reported that they had rowed to the bay of the valley of Valderas or Val d'Iris and had landed in the garden of the world where they found fruits of the most delicious flavour growing wild in the plains and where the cattle were feeding at large among the streams of water that flowed meandering in the savannas and lost their waters among the finest groves of trees they ever beheld but when they marched in pursuit of the  beeves that were every where straying in the vallies they were suddenly surrounded by a body of Spaniards who briskly attacked them some on foot and some on horseback They made a gallant defence and suddenly retreated into an adjoining wood where they were followed by the Spanish horse These were armed each with a case of pistols and some of them besides their pistols had short guns The English being covered by the trees made use of their firearms with advantage and after killing about of the assailants and wounding several others the rest being unsupported by the foot fled with precipitation In this skirmish four English were shot dead besides two desperately wounded and not daring again to attempt the valley they killed a horse and having satisfied their hunger they returned to their canoes  On the th being Christmasday they cruised close to the cape and sent in three of their strikers to kill fish In the afternoon they returned with three great jewfish which afforded them all a Christmasdinner Captain Townley on the th came to his station and brought with him bushels of maize which he had seized at an Indian village four or five leagues up the country and which his men were obliged to carry all that way on their backs  They cruised till the st of January off Corientes and then steered towards the valley of Valderas in order to furnish themselves with beef and before night they anchored in fathom  water a mile from the shore The next day they landed dividing themselves into two parties one party posted themselves on the hills to watch the motions of the Spaniards while the other party traversed the vallies to kill the cattle The Spaniards frequently presented themselves in companies but did not dare to come near enough to engage They continued here till the th in which time they had killed and salted beef enough for two months allowance for their whole company and had not their salt failed them they might have stored themselves with much more  They now gave over all farther expectation of the Manilla ship it being the general opinion that she had escaped as they were afterwards assured she had while the ships were employed in seeking provisions  "So this design failed" says Dampier "through Captain Townley's eagerness after the Lima ship which he attempted in Acapulco harbour For though" adds he "we took a little flour hard by yet the same guide who told us of the Lima ship would have conducted us where we might have had store of beef and maize but instead thereof we lost both our time and the opportunity of providing ourselves and so were forced to be victualling when we should have been cruizing to the total ruin of the enterprize"  Being now provided with beef in abundance and having taken in wood and water in proportionable quantities the two commanders Swan  and Townley having separate views though united in this one grand object of intercepting the Manilla ship thought proper to part company Captain Swan intending to steer westward and Captain Townley to return eastward Hitherto a Moskito chief with three of his men had sailed with Captain Swan but being now about to depart never more to return to their country he was desirous of recommending them to the care of Captain Townley who being bound to the coast of Peru might there put them on shore at some convenient place from whence they might travel over land to the North Sea This Captain Townley undertook to perform and the ships being now under sail they saluted each other and parted  Our navigator continued to sail with Captain Swan Before night they passed Point Pontique which forms the westernmost point of the bay distant from Cape Corientes about twenty leagues This point is in lat deg min N a league to the westward of which are two barren islands called the islands of Pontique Beyond these islands the land trends to the northward presenting a very rugged unpleasant appearance as far as the eye can extend the prospect On the th they came in sight of a small white rock in lat deg min N which at a distance seemed like a ship under sail From this island the land runs still more northerly and the sea tumbles in with such violence upon the shore that for many leagues together  there is no landing there is however every where good anchoring as far as the islands of Chametley These islands are six in number and different from those of the same name on the east of Cape Corientes being a little within the Tropic of Cancer and not above three leagues from the main On these islands grows a fruit called the penguin of which there are two sorts the yellow and the red The yellow grows on a thick stem about a foot high the leaves narrow and about half the length of the stem edged with prickles The fruit grows out from the top of the stem in two or three large clusters or in a cluster It is round and in size like a small pullet's egg the outer coat is thick and tough and the pulp in the inside is full of little black seeds The red penguin is in shape like a little ninepin grows up on stools from the ground in clusters of or on a stool standing upright like the leaves of houseleek and are smaller than the yellow they are surrounded by leaves a foot and a half long edged with prickles like the former They have a sharp pungent taste are very wholesome but those who eat of them immoderately find them heating They grow wild and in the bay of Campeachy Dampier says they are so plentiful that one can hardly range the plains for their prickly leaves  From these islands Captain Swan embarked men in canoes and went himself in search of Coolican a river in the province of Cullacan  with a town of considerable trade probably that marked Pastla in the Spanish maps upon its banks the inhabitants whereof pass in boats to the island of California and fish for pearls They coasted along the shore as far as lat deg N but found no river and after three or four days absence returned without making any discovery  A few leagues to the NNW of Chametley is a narrow entrance into a lake called by the Spaniards Rio de Sal which runs about leagues easterly parallel with the shore forming many low mangrove islands and having depth of water every where for boats to row along its banks In this lake Captain Swan entered accompanied by of his men in canoes In his progress he observed a grazing farm and landing some of his men they found the house deserted and the cattle driven away On proceeding further along the lake two Indians were seen running at some distance whom they took for spies and having discharged a volley of small arms one of them was wounded in the thigh and not being able to continue his race was seized by a party landed for that purpose who brought him on board He informed them that about four leagues from the place where they then were an Indian town was situated in a savanna abounding with cattle The company were scarcely landed to go in search of this town before they were attacked by a body of Spanish horse who not being properly armed  made but a faint opposition and suddenly retired While the English were in pursuit the enemy played off a stratagem that greatly annoyed them We have already mentioned in the voyages of Captain Sir Francis Drake the nature of the grass that covers the savannas on the isthmus of Darien between the North and the South Seas Such was the grass with which the pursuers were surrounded when the Spaniards set it on fire and being dry as stubble it burnt with astonishing fury and spread with such rapidity that it was with the utmost difficulty the whole party escaped being involved in the flames This disaster not only made them more cautious but occasioned a delay which gave the Spaniards time to collect their force and to make a more formidable opposition When the English arrived the next day at the village of which they had intelligence they found it occupied by an armed garrison whom it was necessary to overcome before they could enter but as the Spaniards were for the most part destitute of firearms and the Indians wholly unexperienced in their use the advantage the English derived from that circumstance soon decided the contest in their favour The enemy fled after the loss of some of their leaders and left the conquerors masters of the place having only one man killed with an arrow and their surgeon sorely wounded  They were told by their prisoners that about five leagues from the town of which they were  now in possession two rich gold mines were wrought by Indian slaves belonging to the Spaniards of Compostella the most considerable Spanish city in that district It was not now a time to search for gold when they were in want of every kind of food except the beef they had cured at Valderas Their chief search was now for maize and having plundered the village of all they could find they conveyed it to their boats with great labour and next day quitted the lake and returned on board the ships This lake is laid down in latitude deg min N  On the d of February Captain Swan made another excursion with men in search of the river Rosario at the entrance of which they landed and marched to an Indian town of the same name Here they were told that the gold mines were not above two leagues from the town but like the cock in the fable they rejected the pearl and chose the barleycorn about bushels of maize and the other provisions they found in the place though insufficient for the purpose of their intended voyage were yet of more value in their present necessity than all the gold of Compostella  On the d the ships came to an anchor off the river's mouth of Rosario in seven fathom water oozy ground in lat deg min N  On the th the Captain with his company came on board The quantity of provisions which he had procured was but trifling for so  many men he therefore sent the next day a party in search of the river Oleta but they returned without having found it The river St Jago was next attempted and on the th they anchored in seven fathom water near the mouth of it three leagues E S E of the white rock of Maxentelbo the high hill of Zelisco bearing S E This is one of the principal rivers upon the coast and lies in latitude deg min N  On the th men were sent up the river to make discoveries they spent two days in examining the creeks and inlets and at length came to a large field of maize which they had begun to gather when they spied an Indian who had been sent to watch the corn whom they seized and carried on board in hopes of gaining from him some intelligence by which they might obtain a more effectual and speedy supply He told them there was a town called Santa Pecaque about four leagues from the place where he was taken in which there was great store of provisions and to which he undertook to be their guide Captain Swan overjoyed at the news ordered men to be instantly embarked on board the canoes and to proceed with the Indian as he should direct After rowing five leagues up the river they came in sight of the town when they landed in the night and next morning set out on their march by land About they had advanced within musketshot and having dispatched a  party to reconnoitre they found the town deserted and entered it without opposition  The town of Santa Pecaque is seated near the side of a wood in a spacious plain neatly built with a square in the middle on each side of which the houses are furnished with balconies from whence the inhabitants in general are spectators of the frequent processions exhibited by the Spanish priests in order to convert the Indians who are now almost all become christians in the Spanish settlements The town though small has two churches and they were told that about white families constantly resided in it besides those who occasionally came there as carriers from the mines and as merchants from Compostella These carriers furnish the adjacent miners with maize sugar salt and saltfish of all which there was great plenty in Santa Pecaque  Captain Swan being acquainted by an express with the success of this expedition and with the opportunity that now offered to supply his wants hastened to the town to give the necessary orders When he arrived he divided his men into two parties one party he employed in conveying the provisions to the boats the other in plundering and packing up These he relieved alternately and when both parties were wearied out with this laborious service they caught horses and having laden them with maize dispatched them under a strong escort down to the canoes  On the th when they arrived they found the men who guarded the canoes in high spirits though they had been attacked by the Spaniards and had one man desperately wounded The party that escorted the horses thought it adviseable however to reinforce the canoeguard left the Spaniards should renew the attack Next day they returned to the town and the party left therein were preparing to convoy more maize to the canoes but before they set out Captain Swan understood by an Indian whom they had made prisoner that men were in arms in order to attack them and that they were already advanced within three leagues of the place Upon this intelligence the Captain advised all his men to load as much maize as they could altogether bear away and instantly to depart in a body With this advice they absolutely refused to comply being determined not to leave Santa Pecaque while a load of provisions remained within it It was in vain to endeavour to persuade those whom he could not punish for disobeying orders and therefore on the th he suffered of them to depart with as many loaded horses exhorting them however to march in a body that they might be the better able to defend themselves against any sudden surprize They were equally deaf to advice and instruction they pursued their old course marching in a line and every one leading a single horse The Spaniards had remarked their manner of marching and had placed  themselves in ambush the preceding night They had scarce travelled half a league before they were suddenly set upon and every man cut to pieces before they could assemble to prepare for their defence Captain Swan who had heard the firing hastened with his party to the place of action but on his approach he was struck with horror at the sight of such a number of his followers weltering in their blood stript of their arms and divested of their charge The Spaniards after the slaughter having possest themselves of their musquets c seized also the loaded horses and instantly fled Though the party commanded by Captain Swan did not exceed the number of those already slain yet they were suffered to pass unmolested to the canoes on board of which they embarked and with the provisions they had already secured returned to the ships Among the slain on this occasion was Mr Ringrose who wrote that part of the history of the buccaneers that relates to Captain Sharpe  The slaughter of this unfortunate party dampt the spirits of the survivors and discouraged them from attempting any farther descents upon this coast Is was therefore determined to steer directly for Cape St Lucas on the island of California where they might lie secure from the attacks of the Spaniards till the men were refreshed and the ships put in a condition to undertake a new voyage  The lake of California for so it is called in the Spanish charts is either very little known to the Spaniards or very carefully concealed Though they have mines open already more than they can work in Mexico Chili and Peru yet they are very unwilling to allow other European powers to share the treasures of those countries though they themselves cannot exhaust them nor is it at all likely that any considerable advantages will ever be made by others till by some lucky chance a nearer passage into those seas is discovered  "Were I" says Dampier "to attempt a northwest passage I would go first to the South Seas bend my course from thence along by California and that way seek a passage into the Western Seas If I succeeded in my attempt I should then be without that dread which others must have had of passing from a known to an unknown region and which it is not improbable obliged them to relinquish the pursuit just as they were on the point of accomplishing their designs In like manner" he adds "were I to be employed in search of a northeast passage I would winter about Japan Conca or the northeast part of China and taking the spring and summer before me I would make my first trial on the coast of Tartary wherein if I succeeded I should come into some known part and have a great deal of time before me to reach Archangel or some other European harbour"  On the st they set sail directing their course for California but being opposed by contrary winds were unable to reach their destined port and obliged to put in at the Maria islands in latitude deg min N distant about leagues from Cape St Lucas and from Cape Corientes These islands are three in number and they came to an anchor at the east end of the middlemost in five fathom water clear sand where as soon as they moored their ships they instantly began to unrig them in order to careen  Here Captain Swan proposed to his company to return home by way of the East Indies which was highly approved by some and as violently opposed by others who being ignorant imagined as Dampier says that he would carry them out of the world At first coming they lived upon nothing but seal but in two or three days their strikers furnished them plentifully with turtle and they likewise killed guanicoes conies and large pigeons so that they consumed none of their ship provisions during their stay While the sailors were working upon the ships the officers employed themselves in surveying the stores and measuring the maize which they divided into three parts and allotted two parts to the ship and one part to the bark the ship carrying one hundred men the bark only fifty  Here Dampier who had been long ill of the dropsy tried a very uncommon remedy He  stripped himself stark naked laid himself down upon the hot sand and caused the surgeon to cover him all but his head in this manner he lay near half an hour but being unable to endure it any longer he was carried to his tent and put to bed While he was in the sand he sweat immoderately and to that operation he ascribes the recovery of his health  They staid till the th when their ships being clean they sailed to the valley of Valderas in order to take in fresh water Here they came to an anchor at the mouth of the river where they had anchored before but now that the dry season prevailed they found the water brackish and unfit for use They then weighed and coming to a fine freshwater brook at the foot of a little round hill about four leagues from Cape Corientes they filled on the th tons of excellent water a quantity sufficient to serve their voyage  Being provided with every thing they had reason to expect in this country they now began seriously to consider of the possibility of performing their intended voyage Upon a nice calculation they found they had only days provisions on board at a little more than half a pint of maize aday for each man they had a great many rats on board which they could not prevent from consuming a part of the maize they had according to the Spanish account more than miles to run from Cape Corientes to Guam the nearest land and that  island being subject to the Spaniards they had no certainty of a supply when they came there All these discouragements staggered the most forward of them and nothing could prevail with the majority but a promise from Captain Swan to cruise off Manilla to intercept the register ship as soon as they should arrive in the proper station To this condition Captain Swan was forced to submit though much against his inclination for he had no mind to commence plunderer at first and now he was heartily tired of the trade  On the st of March they took their departure from Cape Corientes the Cygnet Captain Swan with men and the bark Captain Teat with At first they steered with a small land breeze at E N E which carried them three or four leagues then the seawind came on at W N W and changed their course S W By six o'clock in the evening they were nine leagues S W from the cape About the next morning they had the seabreeze at N N E so that at noon they were leagues from the cape It then blew a fresh gale which carried them into the true tradewind At first they had it at N N E and then northerly At leagues from the shore it settled at E N E and there stood till they came within leagues of Guam  After the second day of their departure having fine clear weather and a fresh tradewind they crouded all the sail they could spread and  had frequently observations of the sun moon and stars so that they could calculate their longitudinal distance by way of amusement almost every day At their first setting out they steered into the latitude of deg N and it is remarkable that in a run of more than miles in this latitude they saw none of those small islands that are so plentifully interspersed in the same latitude on the opposite side of the Line nor did Commodore Anson who afterwards pursued the same track from Acapulco see land till he arrived at the island of Tinian As they run at a great rate and the wind had every appearance of continuing after being at sea about days the men began to grow clamorous to have their allowance enlarged with which the Captain was forced to comply tho' he endeavoured to persuade them to patience and represented to them the danger of being becalmed of missing their intended port or of being refused a supply when they arrived But none of these could prevail The cry was for an augmentation and an augmentation they had Till the th of April their allowance was eight spoonfuls of boiled maize a man but after that it was enlarged to ten Dampier who as has been before noticed had long been troubled with a dropsical disorder gathered strength by this spare regimen but those who were in full health it very much weakened He says he constantly drank three times aday but there were many on board who did not drink once in  nine or ten days and some not in twelve one in particular did not drink in days and then said he was not adry though he made water every day Amidst these hardships one poor fellow was found guilty of theft and sentenced to receive three stripes with a twoinch rope on his bare back from every man in the ship Captain Swan Dampier says began first and struck with a hearty good will and his example was followed by all the rest a punishment that must make every feeling mind shudder  Though by the Spanish account the distance from Cape Corientes to Guam is said to be leagues or English miles yet Captain Swan had persuaded his men that by the English account the distance was only leagues and that as Drake and Cavendish had run it in less than days each they with better built ships might run it even in less than either of them when therefore they had run the leagues and the days were nearly expired they began to grow very mutinous and those who had declared against the voyage from the beginning exclaimed bitterly against the Captain and against all those who had persuaded them to undertake it They had during this long run of miles seen neither fish fowl bird or insect except once when at the distance of miles from Cape Corientes they spied some ruabies which they apprehended had come from islands or cliffs at no great distance though they never came in sight of  any The Captain in the midst of these tumults gave them fair words told them that it was probable the Spanish accounts might be the best and encouraged them by giving them hopes that as the breeze continued a few days patience would put an end to their troubles On the th of May they met with some rain and the clouds settling in the west foretold their near approach to land On the th the bark being near three leagues ahead ran over a rocky shoal on which there was only four fathom water On the shoal they observed abundance of fish swimming every where about and Captain Teat imagining that land was near clapt upon a wind with the bark's head to the north and lay by to speak with the ship When the ship came up Captain Teat went on board and related what he had seen on which being then in lat deg min N and Guam being laid down in deg N they clapt on a wind and steered to the northward very doubtful however of being right as no shoals near Guam are noticed in the Spanish charts They pursued this course however till four in the afternoon when to their unspeakable joy they saw the island of Guam at eight leagues distance  "And happy it was says Dampier that we got sight of it before our provisions were gone of which we had but enough for three days more for as I was afterwards informed the crew had combined first to kill Captain Swan and eat him when the victuals were gone  and after him all of us who were accessary in promoting the voyage"  Nothing can exhibit a more striking indication of the ferocity of man's nature than the resolution formed by this abandoned crew After a long series of enormities robberies murders burning of houses and towns exposing their fellowcreatures to want of food and shelter and spreading terror and devastation whereever they set their feet they at length distressed and halffamished themselves begin to murmur against their leaders and the greater number combine to murder the lesser number and to make food of their flesh Need we after reading this have recourse to those we call barbarous nations for instances of the savage nature of man The most uncultivated of those eat only the flesh of enemies killed in war but these wretches who call themselves christians exceeded in their intention every horrid example we read of they conspired to kill and eat their own Chiefs  On the st of May they came to an anchor about the middle of the island of Guam on the west side This is one of the Ladrone islands Dampier places it in deg min N and computes the meridian distance of Guam from Cape Corientes to be about miles and supposes the South Sea to be of greater breadth by degrees than is commonly allowed by hydrographers It is about twelve leagues in length and four in breadth on it the Spaniards have a small  fort of six guns garrisoned by or soldiers and commanded by a Governor and one or two subordinate Officers The climate is healthy and the natives active docile and ingenious and are the best boatbuilders throughout the Indian seas Dampier believes their boats sail the best of any in the world He tried one of them by the log and by the rate she ran in half a minute computes her course at miles within the hour These Indians are no less dexterous in navigating than in building their boats By report they will pass to other islands at leagues distance do business and return again in hours  They had no sooner cast anchor than a Spanish friar came on board with three Indians Captain Swan received the priest with great civility told him they came with no hostile intention but as friends to purchase with their money provisions to continue their voyage The priest replied that provisions were now scarce upon the island but would engage the Governor to do his utmost to supply their wants They thought proper however to detain the padre till his promise was fulfilled  Next day a messenger was sent with letters and a present to the Governor and in the mean time two boats were manned one to fish and another to purchase cocoanuts the former returned empty but the latter came back laden The Governor on the receipt of the letters and present in token of friendship complimented  the Captain with six hogs muskmelons and as many watermelons and at the same time sent an order to the Indians in the nearest town to bake every day as much breadfruit as the ships should require and to assist the mariners in gathering cocoanuts and other fruits with which order the Indians very readily complied During this friendly intercourse the Manilla ship came in sight but being first seen from the fort the Governor found means to apprize her of her danger and she stood off and escaped without being discerned by the ships But in steering to the southward to avoid them she was very near sharing a worse fate for she struck upon the shoal already mentioned and after three days incessant labour floated off with the loss of her rudder During her distress the men got intelligence of her situation but Captain Swan who had determined no longer to follow the infamous employment of plundering found means to divert them from their purpose of attacking her  On the th of May the Governor sent his last present to Captain Swan consisting of some hogs a jar of pickled mangoes a jar of excellent pickled fish a jar of rusk or bread made of fine flour and six or seven packs of rice In return at his own request he was furnished with powder and shot of which he was in want but what he coveted most was a fine English dog which they had on board with which he was likewise gratified The friar's civility was  rewarded with a brass clock an astrolabe and a large telescope in return for which he sent the Captain six hogs some bushels of potatoes a roasting pig and half a hundred weight of fina Manilla tobacco The ships were plentifully supplied besides with every thing the island afforded cocoanuts and breadfruit as many as the ships could stow and upwards of hogs in pickle Captain Swan was desirous of the Governor's letter to the merchants of Manilla having a private view to trade which he concealed from his villainous crew  On the d of June they departed from Guam directing their course to Mindanao one of the Philippines a range of islands extending in length from the th to the th degree of North latitude and occupying in breadth about six degrees of longitude The principal island in this range is Luconia on the north where Magellan in his voyage round the world was slain with a poisoned arrow and where the Spaniards made their first settlement and established at Manilla a mart of traffic with the richest kingdoms of the east  On the south Mindanao is the principal island It is in length about leagues and in breadth fifty It is diversified with hills and vallies The hills abound with gold and the vallies are covered with perpetual verdure It is finely watered with rivers and springs and the plains and lawns are interspersed with groves of lofty trees some of which are  formed for shade and some afford food for the inhabitants  Of the pith of one they make their bread and of the sap of others they make a pleasant drink The marshy grounds abound with rice and on the dry hilly land they cultivate yams potatoes melons and a variety of vegetables unknown to Europeans Their chief fruits are plantains bonanoes nutmegs cloves beetelnuts durians jaccas cocoanuts breadfruit and oranges  The plantain Dampier calls the king of fruit and prefers it to every other The tree that bears it is between three and four feet in circumference and rises about ten or twelve feet high When at its height there springs from the top a stem about the size of a man's arm round which the fruit grows in clusters in shape not unlike the Turkey cucumber the coat of which is of a yellow colour when ripe The inclosed fruit is of a delicate flavour and melts in the mouth like mamalet It is highly esteemed by all Europeans and all their settlements are furnished with plantain walks some families subsisting wholly upon that fruit  The bonanoe differs but little from the plantain except in size being small and less luscious  The nutmeg and clove trees are rare in this island but those that grow are large and fine The natives discourage their growth for fear of exciting the jealousy of the Dutch who have monopolized the whole trade for spices and who keep in pay a company of armed soldiers  to cut down the spicetrees in the uninhabited islands lest other European nations should avail themselves of their plenty Dampier says that he has been assured that in some of the eastern islands it is usual to see at the shedding time cloves three or four inches deep under the trees  Of the beetelnut all the Eastern people are immoderately fond It is the fruit of a tree that grows like the cabbagetree to the height of ten or twelve feet without either leaf or branch and then sends forth shoots on every side among which the fruit is found in clusters on tough stalks about the bigness of a man's finger It is larger than a nutmeg and rounder they cut it when green in quarters wrapping each quarter up in an arekleaf and chewing both together It tastes rough dyes the lips red and makes the teeth black  The durian grows on trees like appletrees and are in size as large as pumpkins covered with a thick rind which when ripe opens and sends forth a strong scent not unlike that of roasted onions It divides into chives each about the size of a pullet's egg the inside of which is of the consistence of cream and must be eaten in its prime or there is no enduring its rankness  The jacca differs very little from the durian only the inside of the former is yellow and that of the latter white  The island of Mindanao abounds likewise with animals of various kinds and according to Dampier is one of the most plentiful islands  in the world and though so near the Equator being in deg N the air is temperate enjoying gentle seabreezes in the day and cooling landwinds in the night  Though they arrived on this coast about the middle of June yet it was the middle of July before they could come to an anchor They were ignorant of the situation of the chief town and arriving first on the opposite side had been all that time playing about the island in search of it At length they cast anchor near the river that bears the name of the island and leads to the chief city They fired seven guns and were answered from the shore by three They were presently after invited by a Raja and one of the Emperor's sons who demanded in Spanish who they were and from whence they came They were answered by Mr Smith the gentleman made prisoner at Leon that they were English and had been long from their country They were told they were welcome and asked if they were come to settle a factory and to open trade They said they came only to purchase provisions At which the Mindaneians appeared disconcerted Captain Swan was some time at a loss to account for this circumstance but he afterwards understood that a Captain Goodluck had been there some time before with some proposals from the EastIndia Company and that when he went away he had given them some reason shortly to expect an Ambassador from England to complete the treaty  The Raja and Prince sat in their canoes and after half an hour's conversation took their leave having invited Captain Swan ashore and promised to assist him in procuring provisions  There are three small islands called Meangis within leagues of Mindanao that abound with gold and cloves and while Captain Swan was beating along the coast in his passage from Guam to the river where the ships now were at anchor they were observed by the Princes of that country and known to be English The Prince of those islands having heard a good report of the English and fearing a visit from the Dutch sent secretly his nephew to Captain Swan to invite him and his company to come and settle in his territories offering every advantage in point of trade and security that he should require Nothing could have been more advantageous both to the nation and the settlers than this offer but Captain Swan paid no regard to it  As the season was now approaching when the westerly monsoon was about to set in which would necessarily oblige the ships to stay a considerable time in the port of Mindanao Captain Swan judged it his interest to cultivate a good understanding with the reigning Sultan With this view he caused a magnificent present to be prepared for the Sovereign consisting of scarletcloth gold lace a Turkish scymetar enriched with jewels and a case of pistols together with presents of less value to his chief Ministers and being in readiness he sent them on shore by  Mr More who sailed with him from London as chief supercargo when his design was to trade in the South Seas These presents were graciously received The Sultan made Mr More sit down by him and asked him many questions concerning England by means of a Spanish interpreter and after an hour's conversation dismissed him with marks of the highest esteem Next day Captain Swan was invited on shore and admitted to an audience in form when the Sultan shewed him letters from the EastIndia Company and desired to know if he came to settle in consequence of those letters He talked with him much concerning the produce of his country and the nature of carrying on commerce and seemed highly entertained with the accounts he gave of it and of the countries through which he had passed and the novelties he had seen He was three hours in close conversation and when he was dismissed was entertained by Raja Laut the King's uncle with a sumptuous banquet after their manner consisting of boiled rice fish and fowls  On this occasion Captain Swan was given to understand that while Mr Goodluck resided in that city he had been robbed by a servant belonging to Raja Laut and that the fellow absconded till Mr Goodluck took his leave but that he was now returned and was ready to be delivered up to be punished in such manner and with such severity as crimes of the like nature are punished by the laws of England But  Captain Swan Entertaind by the Raja Laut Uncle to the King of Mandanao  Captain Swan told him that in his country none but the injured party could prosecute the criminal and as the man had committed no offence against him he could take no cognisance of his crime The Raja heard him with astonishment and to shew that the Princes of Mindanao were far from countenancing such practices he caused the fellow to be stript naked tied to a post and exposed a whole day with his face to the burning sun while at the same time the Moskitos continually tormented him without a possibility of being able to brush them off a kind of torture that few have hardiness enough to survive This condescension in offering to deliver up the criminal to be punished by the Captain was followed by a like offer from the Captain with respect to any of his men who should offend against the laws of the Mindaneians but the Minister returned the compliment and left the punishment to the Captain himself who upon the least complaint punished his men with a severity that shewed more of revenge than of justice and which they afterwards took occasion to resent Among those who felt the effects of his indignation was Captain Teat his chief mate who commanded the bark that accompanied him in his run across the Southern Ocean and others who had offended him on board he remembered now he had the countenance of the court on shore  Captain Swan was highly caressed by the Chiefs of Mindanao and pressed to stay and  secure his ships from the approaching tempests which always attend the change of the monsoons and as the river before the rainy season generally runs low finding it difficult to float his ship over the bar fifty or sixty Mindaneian fishermen were immediately sent with their canoes to assist him in lightening his ship and floating her up the river She was no sooner moored than a free intercourse with the natives commenced They expressed their regard for the English by signs that were easily understood When the Dutch were mentioned to them they would spread their forefingers half a foot apart saying  Bujeto  they are so far distant in friendship when speaking of the Spaniards they would spread their fingers still wider but when the English were spoken of they would bring their fingers quite close saying  Samo  we are all one They were very fond of getting the men to their houses where they kindly entertained them after their manner with tobacco and beetelnut and where those who had money and were decently dressed were pressed to connections with the best families and courted by the young females to the most familiar intimacy To men who have long been at sea such inducements are irresistible and many of them made themselves poor by being too easily drawn in by these allurements to spend their money lavishly Some who accompanied Harris from the North Seas had gold in abundance and the Mindaneian misses when they knew their power very soon found the way  to ease them of it In Mindanao they had goldsmiths and other artificers who charged double their value for such baubles as these prodigals were for ever bespeaking to present to their favourites besides some of them bought houses and hired servants and lived as profusely as the Raja himself imitating the custom of the country and having a pagelly or principal companion and half a dozen mistresses It was not long before the town's people discovered the true humour of English sailors and they likewise took care to make their advantage of it As they had no other but gold in lumps when they wanted change they gave them at the rate of or dollars an ounce To others the same gold was exchanged for dollars The price of provisions and common necessaries was in like manner enhanced by those spendthrifts and thus says Dampier the poor were made to suffer by the folly of the rich and a foundation was laid for imposing upon all Englishmen who should hereafter have occasion to take up their residence in that port  Captain Swan himself was seldom seen at any other house but Raja Laut's or the royal palace At the latter he made frequent visits and at the former dined every day attended by such of his men as had no money to spend who had rice in plenty provided for them and sometimes the remains of fowls or pieces of buffalo drest in a course and served in a hoggish manner The Mindaneians use neither knives nor forks in eating  and they cram their mouths with lumps as large as they can take in those being accounted the genteelest who can open their mouths the widest  The religion of Mindanao is the Mahometan and when the ships first cast anchor it was their  Ramadam  which answers to our Lent when all sports and pastimes are suspended on this account the Raja made an apology for not entertaining the Captain with the usual diversions of the country The wet season too came on which caused a general suspension of all outdoor business  During the month of August the weather became tempestuous and the rains excessive The river swelled and overflowed its banks and it was with the utmost difficulty the ships were prevented from driving on the main land or into the open sea for trees of vast magnitude came floating down with the torrent and frequently pressed against their bows with such weight that they were in continual fear lest their cables should give way During the time of these inundations the city stands as it were in a pond and there is no communication between house and house till the floods abate It was probably this circumstance that suggested to them the manner of constructing their houses They are all built upon posts from to feet high These posts are larger or smaller according to the height or magnitude of the superstructure The Sultan's palace has but  one floor on which however there are many rooms to which they ascend by stairs from the street It stands upon posts and is twenty feet above the level of the ground The ordinary houses are also of one floor and ascended by ladders The roofs are all covered with palmeto leaves The area beneath their houses is usually fenced in and there the poorer sort keep their poultry and there also is received the common draught of their sculleries and were it not for the frequent inundations that carry off the soil the nastiness of the meaner people would render living in Mindanao impossible but every crevice is scoured clean by the violence of the currents which frequently overset the houses though the posts on which they stand are sunk deep in the ground  The inhabitants of Mindanao are like all the Eastern people very clean in their persons they constantly bathe every day once and sometimes oftener they wash after every meal and if they happen to touch by accident any unclean thing they have their times of purification allotted before the expiration of which they are not permitted to leave their chambers Swine are held with them in abomination and though they run wild in the woods yet they are never eaten The chief food of the people is rice sago plantains breadfruit cocoanuts and other nutritious fruits among the better sort fowls and beef are used rather by way of relish than as solid  subsistance for they are boiled to rags in their strange messes  The Mindaneians are of low stature small limbs straight bodies little heads and are of a brown copper colour The women are fairer than the men and their hair is black and long and generally well dressed Their visage too is rounder and better featured than that of the men only their noses are small and so flat between their eyes that the rising is scarce discernible At a distance they look tolerable but on a nearer approach these imperfections are rather disgusting Their dress consists of a petticoat and a loose jacket The sleeves of the jacket are long and wide at the shoulders but sloping down to their wrists where they are so tight that it is with difficulty they get their hands through in putting them on They then rise in folds about the arm and in that lies their pride The better sort of people wear fine callico or silks the meaner sort an ordinary cloth made of the plantaintree which they call saggen The women in general as has been noted love the company of strangers especially of white men and Dampier adds that the men belonging to the ships could scarce walk the streets without being pulled into their houses  The chief artists among them are goldsmiths shipbuilders carpenters and smiths all of whom are excellent in their way allowing for the badness of their tools Dampier gives a description of their smith's bellows which is  simple and ingenious It is composed of two hollow cylinders like the large wooden pipes used by us for the conveyance of water they are cut flat at both ends in length about four feet and placed upright at the distance of two feet from each other upon a stone hearth before the fire Within two inches of the bottom of each a pipe is placed projecting like a cock towards the fire but bending so as that the pipes from both cylinders meet and terminate in one before they reach it Thus constructed and fixed firm a man with two light brushes made of feathers which he works alternately like two pistons keeps up a continual blast and with this simple contrivance without either vice or anvil other than a large stone or the buttend of an old cannon they fabricate their work to admiration Their carpenters have neither saws nor planes and yet they split and smooth their boards with great neatness This requires time but their work is the more durable for it because the grain being unbroken the timber remains the tougher  In Mindanao there is only one mosque or place of worship and that but little frequented by the meaner people In this mosque they have a contrivance for striking the time A drum of vast dimensions shaped in form of a bell is placed over a large hollow cavity the head of which drum is covered with brass and called a gong A certain number of men are appointed to attend this gong who relieve each  other alternately night and day and with a stick as large as a man's arm with a ball at the end of it at certain intervals they strike the gong the sound of which is heard from one extremity of the town to the other and supplies the place of a clock  The Mindaneians use circumcision and that operation is performed with great ceremony The usual time among the common people is about the age of twelve but the Princes of the blood are circumcised like the Jews at the end of eight days On this occasion the warriors all appear in arms and like Europeans at a review make a sham fight for the diversion of the spectators in which both the Sultan and his General are principal performers  When the waters were subsided and the Ramadam over Raja Laut the Sultan's brother and General of his forces to entertain Captain Swan assembled the dancers who are women bred from their infancy like those in Europe to that art On this occasion more than of them were assembled who being ranged in a ring danced to their own music In these dances their feet and legs are but little employed Having no other than vocal music they sing at first solo parts in slow time but their chorusses are brisk and then their hands arms heads and bodies are all employed in such contortions that one would think they were made without bones  Dancing and processions were the favourite diversions among the Chiefs of this island and  Captain Swan in conformity to the prevailing taste resolving to give an English entertainment ordered his music ashore and such of his men as could dance were likewise ordered to attend Accordingly having hired a convenient house he invited the Sultan and Chiefs of the place with their women to be spectators of the splendor of the European dances He had caused the house to be hung round with the richest silks of which he had store on board and decorated it with gold and silverlace which when illuminated with a profusion of waxcandles made a most brilliant appearance When the company assembled they were struck with amazement and thought all they beheld was the effect of enchantment Among the dancers there was one Jack Thacker a common sailor who at the musichouses at Wapping had learned to dance a hornpipe This man attracted the notice of the Mindaneians more than all the rest because more in the antic manner to which they were accustomed Him therefore they fixed their eyes upon and considered as a man of consequence When they had spent the best part of the night in feasting their eyes and their appetites for Captain Swan had ordered his cook to prepare a cold collation of sweetmeats and other savoury dishes they were still unwilling to retire and it was almost daybreak before the Sultan retired and very unwillingly was accompanied by his female train Raja Laut and his women staid longer and it is said notwithstanding  his devotion to his prophet drank plentifully of wine  Nothing was talked of so much among the Mindaneians during the stay of the ships as the comic English dancer of whom Raja Laut was willing to know the history and having enquired was told by one of his companions that he was an English nobleman who travelled for his diversion and that all those who wore fine cloaths were gentlemen of inferior quality who left their own country out of curiosity to see the countries abroad  This harmless imposition being told by the General to Captain Swan who was of a morose unsociable disposition cost the poor fellow a hearty drubbing though he was wholly ignorant of what had been told He was first stript of his fine cloaths in the presence of the Raja by his Captain's orders and then stript of his nobility by flogging his back It was not long however before the man was revenged  About the middle of November they began to prepare for their departure and for that purpose their first business was to examine the ships bottoms the sheathing of which they found eaten by the worm like a honeycomb and the bottom of the bark not being sheathed was eaten to the timbers and the vessel thereby rendered unserviceable application was therefore made to the Raja for planks to new sheathe the ship The Raja's sincerity was never suspected till this incident gave reason for jealousy When he  came down to the river and saw the carpenters ripping off the sheathing he shook his head and seemed much disconcerted declaring he had never before seen a ship with two bottoms His hope was that the ship like the bark would have been eaten through and that he should have had all her guns A like accident had formerly entitled him to a like advantage when a Dutch ship by anchoring in the same river during the westerly monsoon was entirely disabled and never again put to sea He was sensible enough of the mischief that would infallibly ensue to the ships by lying so long among those destructive vermin for whenever the natives disuse their vessels they haul them up on the dry beach burn their bottoms and there let them lie till they want again to use them  While some were employed in ripping off the old wormeaten planks others were busy in preparing new and by the beginning of December the sheathing was repaired and tallowed The latter part of the month was taken up in putting the ballast stores and guns aboard this was a work of the greater labour as it was first necessary to carry the ship out to sea before it was undertaken About the beginning of January they began to fill water and to take in rice and application was made to Raja Laut to furnish buffaloes as he had all along promised to do He now began to form excuses and pretended to take men out every day ahunting for those creatures always run wild but always  came home empty and pleaded ill success The Captain too began to act very mysteriously By the help of the government on shore he had got the absolute ascendancy over his men and was as implicitly obeyed as if he had been Captain of a king's ship When he was importuned to declare when he intended to sail he chose to be silent and when the men wanted to know upon what enterprize they were next to be employed he reproached them with their eagerness for piracy He had sold Raja Laut some tons of iron and lead and was to have had in return rice and beef as to the first the Raja had failed in furnishing the stipulated quantity and the latter he had hitherto in no shape fulfilled The Raja had besides borrowed of him ounces of gold and when he required payment the Raja demanded a much larger sum for his own board and the board of his men This treatment and these disappointments served to discompose a mind naturally sour and to put him out of humour with every body about him  All this while the westerly monsoon was wasting that was to carry them on to India The men began again to murmur and grow unruly some weary of rambling about and who had formed connections with the natives were for staying at Mindanao some who had husbanded their money of whom indeed there were but few were eager to get home and others who were poor by far the majority were for continuing their ravages and were impatient to be in action  While matters were in this situation strong representations were made to the Captain to come on board and to declare himself and after many delays a day was at length fixed for a determination  In the mean time those who were bent on returning home foreseeing that continued extravagancies would necessarily create new wants and that new wants would require new means of supply took occasion secretly to purchase a canoe and formed a design to depart in the night for Borneo where by a letter just received from thence by a Mindaneian vessel they hoped to meet with an English factory and from thence find a passage home but Captain Swan getting intelligence of their design seized their canoe and threatened to punish for deserters all those concerned in the plot  Another party about the same time hearing that the ship was about to sail retired into the country to conceal themselves till after her departure  The party on board who had nothing but the ship's allowance to subsist on became unruly and sent ashore to the merchants iron to sell for arrack and honey with which they made themselves drunk and grew quarrelsome All these disorders Dampier says might easily have been redressed had Captain Swan exerted his authority in time and established proper discipline on board the ship but he living with his merchants constantly on shore and leaving every  one to do as he pleased on board they encouraged one another in their villainies and at length grew mutinous  When these things were come to extremity he gave orders that the whole crew should attend him on board the ship on the th of January but unluckily for him two days before this meeting was to take place Captain Swan sent his gunner to fetch something he had occasion for out of the locker of his cabin This man in rummaging for what he wanted among other things happened to take out the Captain's journal which being laid carelesly by was taken up by one John Read an ingenious young man who likewise kept a journal out of mere curiosity to peep in it to see how nearly his and the other agreed  At the first opening of the book he cast his eye on a part in which the Captain had made a memorandum of the mutinous behaviour of his men in their passage from Cape Corientes to Guam and had particularly noted that of one John Read a Jamaicaman a namesake of the Read who took the journal but no relation This naturally excited his curiosity to look farther and he found means while the gunner was busy to convey the journal away to examine it at his leisure As soon as the gunner was gone ashore John Read the artist shewed the book to John Read the Jamaicaman and both of them held a consultation with their comrages on the contents These men who  were before ripe for mischief now grew outrageous and it was unanimously agreed to consult Captain Teat who as has been before noted had received unworthy treatment from Captain Swan on shore which they knew he only wanted an opportunity to resent Teat left nothing unsaid to aggravate the failings of his superior and to incense the company against him He represented him as proud ignorant avaricious cruel and vindictive and withal cowardly and unfit to command upon any bold and manly enterprize called to their minds the opposition he made to the attacking the Manilla ship off Guam by the conquest of which they would all have been enriched and which he said Swan did not oppose out of a principle of honesty or gratitude but from the fear of engaging a ship so much superior to his own in weight of metal and in numbers though he Teat would have pawned his head to have been master of her in a few hours close attack Men whose expectations have been raised to an unreasonable pitch give easy credit to unfavourable suggestions against the authors of their disappointment The crew took lire and instantly bound themselves by an oath to deprive Captain Swan of the command without naming any officer to substitute in his room nay so precipitate was their resolution that the majority were for setting sail immediately and leaving all that were on shore behind and this hasty resolve would certainly have taken place had either of the  surgeons been on board but as their cry was for war it was judged too desperate to go to sea without one skilful person on board to assist the wounded  As all this passed in the night it was agreed to stay till morning and then to send a trusty messenger on shore speedily to request the surgeons to come to the assistance of a man who had broken his leg The chief surgeon said he should see the man the next day and in the mean time sent his mate Mr Herman Coppinger to his immediate relief This man a few days before was sleeping at his mistresses when a snake twisted itself round his neck but quietly went away upon his waking without hurting him Coppinger supposing the accident real made haste to pack up his moveables to go on board and as the Captain was to have his general rendezvous the next day Dampier took the opportunity of going with him They scarce had mounted the ship's side before they discovered the trick But when the mutineers were thus in possession of the surgeon they presently dispatched the canoe to shore again to invite all the men who chose it to come on board but with a strict caution not to tell the reason lest their design should reach the ears of their Captain  The th in the morning they weighed and fired a gun The Captain much alarmed immediately dispatched Mr Nelly his mate to know the cause To him they told their grievances  and shewed the journal he persuaded them to stay till next day to hear what the Captain and merchants had to say They did so and Mr Harthop came on board in the morning He advised them to a reconciliation and to take more rice on board They were deaf to his persuasion yet at his entreaty they staid till two in the afternoon to wait for the Captain and such gentlemen or seamen as chose to accompany them but suffered none to go ashore except Mr Harthop and a man with a wooden leg Dampier remarks that if Captain Swan had then come on board as a man of sense and spirit ought to have done he might at the very last have crusht their designs and reduced the mutineers to order and discipline but being of a sullen suspicious vindictive temper himself he dreaded the resentment of those he had marked for vengeance and therefore suffered the time to elapse and was with others left behind in the town Besides these six or eight had deserted and were up the country and sixteen had died of poison given them as was supposed by the husbands of those women whom they had seduced and there were others on board who had received the poison and died of it some months after In this manner their numbers were considerably diminished and of who sailed from Cape Corientes not above were now on board  It has been more than once hinted that Captain Swan sailed from London with no design of  privateering but of carrying on trade with the Spaniards on the western coasts of America He had therefore a great quantity of heavy goods such as iron and lead not yet disposed of some of which he had sold to Raja Laut and no doubt was willing to have received the payment before he departed This may in some measure account for his delay His crew was composed of men who most of them had forced themselves upon him for purposes which he abhorred and perhaps he wanted to have rid himself of the greatest part of them if he could have found a proper opportunity Those marked in his journal were no doubt the men most obnoxious to him and the most averse to trade which he was determined to follow in his way home having already l of his owners money which he had received for the goods put up by auction at his first commencing buccaneer with this he purposed to have purchased a cargo to take with him from the East Indies Hence arose his mysterious conduct and his want of resolution The loss of his bark was his embarrassment Could that have been rendered serviceable his design could more easily have been carried into execution The suspicious part of the crew might have been shipped on board the bark and by giving them a wrong track they might have been deserted in the night and left to their own course But a discovery being made before the Captain's designs were ripe for execution he was entangled in his own net  But to return On the th of January at three o'clock in the afternoon they set sail from the river Mindanao and next day came abreast of Chambango where formerly the Spaniards had a settlement and where it is said there were plenty of Swine and buffaloes On the th they anchored in a good bay on the west side of a small island where they chose their officers constituting John Read the Jamaicaman Captain Thomas Teat Master and Henry More Quartermaster and having cut some curious shortjointed canes and plentifully supplied the ship with water from a clearspring they pursued their course but on their passage they struck on a rock where after lying two hours they were heaved off by the rising of the tide and escaped with the loss only of a large piece of their rudder though in more danger than ever they had experienced in the whole voyage  On the th they anchored at the northwest end of the island of Mindera in fathom water While they lay there a canoe with four Indians from Manilla came along side who informed them that at Manilla there was seldom less than or sail of ships of different nations who came to traffic with the Spanish merchants and that if they meant to trade they might for a trifle have a letter of recommendation from a friar to whom they were carrying dispatches and would in a few days return with his answer Trade however was no part of their employment and the Indians were suffered to pass without molestation  On the d they reached Luconia the island so ardently wished for by this piratical crew and presently descried a sail which they instantly pursued and took She proved a Spanish bark from Pangassanam laden with rice and cottoncloth and bound for Manilla The master of this prize was boatswain to the Acapulco ship that passed by Guam this man gave Dampier an account of all that happened on that occasion The time of the year being too far spent to effect any thing of consequence on this coast they concluded to sail for Pulo Condore and there wait till the latter end of May about which time the Acapulco ship generally arrives at Manilla With this resolution they quitted Luconia on the th of February and on the th of March cast anchor at the island of Condore on the coast of Cambodia Among the productions of these islands for there is a cluster of them there is a lofty tree the body of which is in diameter three or four feet from which the inhabitants extract a clammy juice which being boiled becomes a perfect tar and answers all the purposes of that balsam On the th they entered a convenient harbour and employed themselves in careening their ships in which they were assisted by the natives of the island who brought them hogs and turtle in exchange for rice of which they had now great plenty  While they lay in this harbour two of the men died who had been poisoned in Mindanao they were opened by the surgeon and their livers  were found black light and dry like pieces of cork  Before they departed they engaged an old native who could speak the Malayan language to pilot them to Siam where they expected to purchase dried fish having nothing now but rice to eat at sea  On the st of April they sailed from Condore and on the th anchored in the bay of Siam where however they could get no fish On the st of May they left Siam and in their return to Pulo Condore overtook a Chinese junk laden with pepper who told them that the English were settled on the island of Sumatra at a place called Silleber which was the first intelligence they received of that factory This junk accompanied them to Pulo Condore where Captain Read observing a Malayan vessel at anchor within shore sent a canoe to learn from whence they came but knowing the Malayans to be desperate fellows cautioned his men not to trust themselves on board but to hail them from the boat but the men not regarding the Captain's instructions went on board armed which the Malayans observing fell upon them unawares with their short daggers and stabbed five or six of them dead upon the spot the rest jumped into the sea and saved themselves by swimming among whom was one Daniel Wallis who never could swim before or since but in his fright made shift to reach the boat and made his escape with the rest Here Herman Coppinger  the surgeon went on shore on purpose to leave this diabolical company but Read sent an armed force and pressed him on board again Dampier intended following his example but waited a more convenient place  They were now confined at this island by stormy weather till the th of June and in the mean time a Malayan Portuguese from the junk entered on board whom they entertained as an interpreter to facilitate an intercourse with the natives When they weighed anchor the wind was contrary yet they kept plying to the westward in hopes of its shifting to carry them to Manilla before their much longedfor prize should arrive In this hope they continued labouring incessantly for days when being almost worn out with fatigue and finding no probability of accomplishing their desires they relinquished that project in despair and instead of it stood away for Prata in lat deg min N where they flattered themselves with fishing up much treasure from the China ships that had been cast away on that island some of which were said to contain immense riches But in this too they were disappointed by adverse winds and notwithstanding the utmost exertion of their skill in seamanship they were driven by the violence of the gale to the island of St John on the coast of China While they lay at this island they visited the shore every day and purchased hogs fowls and buffaloes Some of the men visited the continent but found nothing there that answered their purpose  On the d of July they weighed anchor with a gentle breeze but on the th there came on a violent gale from the northeast which increased till the dead of the night when the rain began to pour down in such torrents that the fountains of heaven seemed to be opened and a second deluge threatened at the same time the thunder began to crack and the flashes of lightning that pierced through the torrents of rain appeared upon the face of the deep as if the sea was overspread with a blue flame The darkness that succeeded between the flashes presented the most horrid gloom that ever covered the deep The sea was raised to an astonishing height and the waves broke short upon the ship with such violence that it was thought every succeeding billow must have dashed her to the bottom One sea struck away the rails of the head and at the same time dislodged the sheetanchor that was lashed with its fluke over the bend of the ship in the strongest manner and it was every moment expected to beat a hole through the ship by striking against her bows It then became necessary to steer right before the wind to endeavour to secure the anchor and it was impossible afterwards to change the course till the storm abated The fury of the storm abated about four in the morning about which time they observed what the sailors call a  Corpus Sant  at the masthead This meteor is seen at sea sometimes at the masthead sometimes at the yardarm and sometimes upon the deck When  it appears aloft it is like a star and is taken for a good omen but when below it resembles a glow worm and always dreaded as a bad sign The crew was overjoyed on seeing it at the very pinnacle of the ship's fane  From two in the morning till seven they kept scudding before the wind but the wind gradually dying away and the sea subsiding they set their mizzen brought the ship up upon a wind and lay to under their mizzen till eleven when for two hours there ensued a perfect calm yet the sky looked black and lowring About one the wind shifted to the southwest and began again to blow hard with violent rain They furled up their mizzen wore ship and suffered her to scud before the wind as before till ten at night when the wind ceased and before morning the sea was calm and the sky perfectly serene This storm however dispirited the crew who were now driven out of their knowledge and were anxious for nothing but a place of shelter to preserve them from the fury of a second hurricane which they had reason to expect towards the full of the moon  They consulted their seacharts and concluded to steer for the Piscadores islands situated in lat deg N of which however they knew nothing but the name On the th of July they came in sight of them and when they arrived were astonished to see so many junks passing and repassing as were continually in sight They followed some of the largest into a spacious  harbour which brought them to a considerable town such as they did not expect to have found among islands so little known On their attempting to land they were met by a Tartarian officer who demanded whence they came of what nation they were and whither they were bound And being told they were English and driven there in distress they were kindly entertained but were told they must not come on shore but whatever necessaries they wanted should be sent them on board without delay Mutual civilities were exchanged The ship was supplied with the best provisions they had ever tasted and the Captain in return sent a curious Spanish silverhilted rapier an English carbine and a gold chain as a present to the Governor They staid till the th and then directed their course to a cluster of islands that lie between Formosa and Luconia the place they still set their hearts upon On the th of August they came in sight of the islands they were in pursuit of and contrary to expectation found them well inhabited  On these islands were plenty of goats and swine but very few birds or poultry It is an observation of Dampier founded on reason and confirmed by experience that in countries abounding in corn and maize birds and all manner of fowls are bred in abundance but in those islands where the inhabitants subsist chiefly on fruits roots and fish birds wild and tame are more rare  As these islands were without names in the sea charts Captain Read called them all by one general name of Bashee Islands The situation of their towns was remarkable They were built on precipices inaccessible on every side except by ladders placed at the ends of the streets which all ran in lines parallel to each other and on which the houses rise in ranges one above another till they terminate in a single row The inhabitants of these islands were acquainted with the use of iron and they had amongst them a yellow metal that very much resembled gold for some of which Captain Read exchanged iron and Dampier laments that he could purchase none of it because he had nothing to bestow in return They were very ingenious had large fishingboats and lived in a peculiar manner different from any people they had yet visited They were not very delicate in their food for they would gather up the goatsskins and goatspaunches which the men threw away and would singe broil and eat the former the latter they would stew not over nicely cleansed and mincing raw fish very small would mix the mess together and with a little salt over it make a very savoury meal The paunches of the swine they never touched They appeared to be very cleanly in their persons and withal so honest and good natured that they would take nothing but what was given them nor were they ever out of humour with the strangers though they had often cause enough nor with one another  No provocation could incense them to anger nor any opportunity induce them to theft They brought constantly every morning goats hogs potatoes and fruits to the ship which they exchanged for iron nails old hoops or bullets Thus the crew of the ship fared sumptuously every day and salted or hogs for future use These islands lie in lat deg min N  Being now sufficiently stored with provisions and having filled their casks with water after staying from the th of August till the th of September and after having mended their sails and scrubbed the ships bottom they were preparing to sail when a violent storm came on which forced them to cut their cables and put to sea leaving six of their best men on shore  They put before the wind with their bare poles but it was the first of October before they could recover to their former station On the following day their six men were brought on board by the natives whom they rewarded with three bars of iron a present to them more valuaable than so many bars of solid gold The men reported that as soon as the ship was out of sight the natives were more kind to them than ever that they endeavoured to prevail upon them to cut their hair short like theirs and that they offered to each the choice of a wife with a small hatchet a set of planter's tools and a portion of land for each of them to cultivate by way of dowry and when the ship came in sight again they then importuned them for iron which was the only recompence they required  This second storm quite disconcerted all their measures They began to think that the winds and the waves were employed against them and were terrified with the thoughts of their unhappy situation Most of them were heartily weary of being tost to and fro to no manner of purpose and were very desirous of getting home only Read and Teat were determined to make their fortunes at whatever risque they therefore finding the crew resolute to leave this dangerous coast persuaded them to accompany them to Cape Comorin where if they disapproved of their proceedings every one should be at liberty to follow his own course To this they all agreed but these freebooters fearing to meet English or Dutch ships in the direct road proposed to coast along the east side of the Philippines and so keeping south towards the spice islands to pass into the Indian ocean near the island of Timor With this view they set sail on the d of October and leaving the island of Luconia on the west  "with all our golden projects" says Dampier "along with it we stood to the southward till we came in sight of the island St John on the coast of Mindanao and on the th came to an anchor on the southeast side of that island"  While they lay in this bay the young prince of Meangis formerly mentioned came on board and importuned Captain Read to transport him and his men back to his own island promising to reward him handsomely for his trouble He  said that a few days before he had seen Captain Swan and some of his people all well at the city of Mindanao that they had accompanied Raja Laut in a military expedition against his enemies and had acquired great honour and were in high favour with the Sultan that Captain Swan was preparing to leave the island and that he had offered ounces of gold for a ship to carry him off but did not think the Raja would suffer him to depart Captain Read promised to stay for the prince three days and in that time he engaged to return with his men In the mean time Dampier took occasion to sound how the crew stood affected towards their old Captain and found one party who happened to be filling water ashore very well inclined and he desired them to be silent till he had consulted the other party whose turn it was next day to fill water at the same place but one of the company who appeared to be the most zealous in Swan's favour as soon as he got aboard discovered the secret on which Read and Teat ordered all hands on board and weighed directly  Dampier says he was afterwards informed that Captain Swan and his men continued long at Mindanao that Messieurs Harthop and Smith merchants both died there that Rofy and Nelly his mates got passage in a Dutch ship to Batavia and from thence after various adventures to Europe and that Swan himself with his surgeon endeavouring to get  on board another Dutch ship were run down and drowned by the natives by order of Raja Laut who seized their gold Among other reasons assigned for this treachery Dampier mentions Swan's threatening on some provocation to raise a band of men to destroy the town and seize upon the country Be this as it may the poor Captain lost his life and the Raja kept his money Part of his journal as far as Cape Corientes was recovered and preserved by a Mr Moody of whom mention will be made hereafter  On November the d the day the prince was to have come on board Captain Read set sail and stood to the west till on the th the wind changing they came up with the north east end of the island of Celebes in lat deg N leagues to the southward of Gilolo on the western side of which lie the clove islands of Tidore and Ternate the finest in the world At the southermost end of Celebes the town of Macasser is seated the chief place of trade in those parts belonging to the Dutch  They anchored in a sandy bay on the southeast side of Celebes where they found a creeping kind of vine the leaves of which pounded and boiled with hog'slard is an infallible cure for old ulcers The men knowing its virtues crammed their chests with it and one man whose legs were ulcerated was perfectly cured by the use of it  Here they cut down a tree feet in circumference  and feet in clean body It proved unsound and therefore unfit for the purpose they intended it which was that of a canoe they therefore left it and set sail  On the th they sailed south and in the afternoon they had a violent tornado and saw a spout This phenomenon appears at first like a small ragged cloud hanging sloping from a black heavy cloud above small at the bottom seemingly no bigger than a man's arm Underneath this the sea begins to be in gentle agitation and gradually proceeds to foam and froth till a violent whirling ensues and then it flies upwards in a pillar the base of which may be about one hundred paces in compass but lessening gradually till it decreases to the size of the spout with which it meets and through which the rising seawater seems to be conveyed to increase the cloud As soon as the water reaches the spout you then see the cloud that was at rest before drive along with incredible swiftness sucking up the water in its course and causing a furious wind to fly before it Thus it will continue sometimes half an hour sometimes longer till breaking off all the water that remains below the spout falls down again into the sea with a dreadful noise and violent agitation of the waves Dampier relates that one Captain Records of London being on the coast of Guinea in the year in a ship of tons was overtaken by one of these spouts which broke before he could well furl his fails to receive it On its breaking it made  the same kind of noise as if a castle or some immense building had been plunged from a great height into the sea and raised the billows in proportion to its height The fury of the wind at the same time took the ship on the starboard bow and snapt off the boltsprit and foremast both at once like rotten sticks and drove the ship along ready to overset her but the ship presently righting and the wind whirling round took her again on the opposite quarter and snapt the mizzenmast as the foremast and boltsprit had been snapt before Three men were in the fore top when the foremast broke and one on the boltsprit when they fell into the sea but all were saved and the ship with difficulty carried into port  December st they continued to move slowly along and on the th they came up with the northwest end of the island of Bouton where their strikers killed some turtle and brought with them an Indian who conducted them to a harbour where they had an interview with the Sultan and where they were permitted to purchase whatever they wanted and where Captain Read was presented by the Sovereign with a little boy who had a double set of teeth one set within another on each jaw  On the th they took leave of the Sultan and were about weighing anchor but when they expected it to rise being hooked to a rock the cable came home without it As soon as they were loose finding the anchor irrecoverable they steered to the southeast and fell in with  some islands five or six leagues from Callasusung harbour They appeared very green and as they passed them in the night they heard drums beating but whether for mirth or spreading an alarm they knew not  On the th they passed the island of Omba and saw in it many smoaks by day and fires by night but observed no inhabitants From Omba they passed by Timor where meeting with tornados and strong gales of wind they endeavoured to get clear of the shoals and stood off south intending to touch at New Holland to try what that country would afford  On the th of January they fell in with the coast of New Holland in lat deg min S and steering close in came to a point from whence the land trends east and southerly for or leagues but how far southerly Dampier says he does not know That able navigator however pronounced that if it was not a continent it neither joined to Asia Africa nor America They fell in upon the west side and examined but a small part of this vast tract of land of which Captain Cook in his late voyage round the world in the Endeavour traversed the eastern coast for near miles and has left it still doubtful whether it is island or continent There is a remarkable difference between Dampier's description of the part he visited on the west and that described by Captain Cook in the same latitude on the east side  "The land" says Dampier "is of a dry sandy soil destitute of water except  you make wells There are divers sorts of trees but the woods are not thick nor the trees large Most of them were dragontrees of the size of appletreeswe compared the gum with the gum dragon we had aboard and found it the samewe saw no trees that bore fruit We saw no animal nor any track of animal but one and that was of a beast of the size of a mastiffdogfew landbirds and none bigger than a blackbirdfew seafowlsfew fish turtle and manatee excepted The inhabitants are the most miserable people in the worldwithout houseswithout cloathingwithout conveniences of any kindand setting aside their human shape very little different from brutes They are tall strait bodied thin and small limbs they have great heads round foreheads and large brows Their eyelids are always halfclosed they have great bottlenoses full lips wide mouths and the two foreteeth in the upper jaw wanting in all of them but whether they draw them out or not I know not Captain Cook says those on the opposite side have their teeth entire They are longvisagedwithout beardsof an unpleasing aspect with no one graceful feature in their facestheir hair black short and curled like negroesand their colour coalblack They live in companies or men women and children togethertheir food is fish and their manner of catching them is in weirs across little inlets of the sea in which every tide leaves somethey have no instruments  to take great fishin other places they fish for cockles muscles periwinkles but of these there are but fewof what they catch all partake alikeall watch the tidesfor all depend upon the sea for their support the earth producing neither herb root pulse or any sort of grain These poor creatures adds Dampier have a sort of weapons consisting of a piece of wood shaped somewhat like a cutlass and a long straight pole with a sharp end hardened in the fire with these they made a shew of frightening us but on firing one gun they all ran away frighted"  Such is the description given by Dampier of the people of the north part of New Holland and it is not a little astonishing that a man by once touching upon their coast could so minutely describe a people with whom he could no otherwise converse but by signs and gestures The crew made an acquaintance with some of them and gave them meat which they readily devoured but paid no regard to the ship nor did they seem to admire any thing that was shewn or offered to them While the ship remained here where nothing was to be gotten Dampier endeavoured to persuade the men to carry her to some English factory but that too being told the Commanders he was threatened to be set ashore and left among these miserable beings  On the th of March they quitted New Holland with a view to sail to the isle of Cocos in  lat deg min S but the wind being contrary they chose to bear away to the islands on the west of Sumatra with which Dampier says he was well pleased as he then might have an opportunity of making his escape from them They met with nothing worth notice till the th when they fell in with a woody island where they killed boobies and menofwar birds as many as the ship's company could eat and where they found a land animal resembling a large crab without its great claws such as Sir Francis Drake met with in the island of Ternate and which being dressed was excellent meat These creatures burrow in the ground like rabbits and two of them were as much as a man could eat  They made but a short stay at this island and proceeding on their course on the th of April they came in sight of the high land of Sumatra and on the th they came to a small island called Triste or leagues to the west of Sumatra where they loaded their boats with cocoanuts and struck some turtle to supply their table having now nothing but rice to live upon  They continued cruising among the islands to the west of Sumatra and on the th they came in sight of a sail to which they gave chace and on the th they took her She proved a proa with four men belonging to Achin laden with cocoanuts and cocoanut oil They took out of her as much as they thought fit bored a hole in her bottom and sunk her keeping the  four men prisoners All this coast is known to the English by the name of the Westcoast without adding the name of Sumatra and the prisoners shewed the channels and openings to the island of Achin where the English had a factory to which many on board wished to find a passage  The th of May they came in sight of one of the Nicobar islands the southernmost of which lies about leagues to the N N W of Sumatra The inhabitants of these islands are independent of every other people and trade with the ships of every nation indifferently that happen to touch upon their coast Their chief commodities are ambergrease and fruits the former of which they adulterate abominably and Captain Welden who touched at these islands a few weeks before their arrival purchased some at a low price that was worth nothing  On the th of May they anchored at the N W end of the island of Nicobar properly so called in lat deg min N Here Dampier quitted the freebooters but not without some difficulty He knew it was impossible to do it by stealth and therefore asked Captain Read as soon as he learned that the ship was about to sail to set him on shore on this island He says he had another motive for staying at this particular place besides that of leaving Captain Read which he always intended and that was that he had here a prospect of commencing a profitable trade for ambergrease with these people  and of gaining a considerable fortune to himself for by rowing with the natives and conforming to their customs and manner of living he imagined he should be able to learn how they got their ambergrease and likewise the whole secret of preparing it Captain Read thinking this as obscure a place as any and being willing no doubt to be rid of a man who was for ever exciting the company to oppose him very readily consented and Dampier as readily took him at his word In an instant he got all his moveables together and stowing them in the ship's canoe he prevailed upon some of the people to row him ashore and to land him on a sandy bay near to which were two houses but without inhabitants He had not been landed an hour before Captain Teat and three or four armed men came to fetch him on board again He tells us that if a cabbinboy had been sent for him he should have returned but he no sooner entered the ship than he found the whole crew in an uproar several others encouraged by his example insisting to be set ashore likewise among whom was Herman Coppinger the surgeon who having jumped into the boat with a gun in his hand swore he would shoot dead the first man that opposed him yet John Oliver the quartermaster leapt into the canoe to him and wrenched the gun from him he was presently followed by others who forced Coppinger again on board When this tumult was appeased and the surgeon again in their possession they suffered Dampier with two other  malecontents a Mr Hall and a sailor named Ambrose to depart quietly and the man who rowed them on shore having concealed an ax gave it them at parting well knowing what a valuable present it would be to conciliate them to the Indians These three Englishmen were soon joined by the four prisoners taken from the Achinese proa and the mongrel Portuguese formerly taken from the Chinese junk all of whom Captain Read set on shore before he departed They were now eight in number and having concluded to leave the island and row to Sumatra at leagues distance they purchased a canoe of the natives for an ax and having provided a sufficient quantity of provisions for their subsistence they all embarked on the  h of May in order to proceed but they had no sooner put to sea than the canoe overset and turned bottom upwards Being near the shore they preserved their lives by swimming but though the English recovered their chests and firearms yet their books and papers were miserably defaced by the seawater their powder escaped without injury being sealed up Though this accident seemed an unfortunate outset yet it proved the means of their future safety for while the English were drying their books and cleaning their arms the Achinese employed themselves in sitting up their boat with outleaguers which are beams placed across the body of the boat projecting a yard or two over the sides and united at the extremities by transverse  boards jointed to the ends while these remain entire the vessel can never overset Besides the outleaguers the Achinesemen had provided a good stout mast and had contrived a sail And thus fitted out on the th of May they again embarked but their provisions being exhausted it was necessary for them to repair to a distant part of the island to procure a supply Here a misunderstanding arose between them and the natives which by the prudent management of Dampier was soon accommodated He observes that there is not a people upon earth that he should be afraid to approach unarmed and alone provided no previous injury had been done them by any of his company unprovoked An European has it always in his power to insinuate himself into the favour of the most savage people by some slight by shewing them some toy by smiles and submission and even by shewing them the simple knack of lighting a match with a flint and steel The only danger he adds is from their first onset because their way is to abscond and kill by surprize if therefore their first fury can be avoided the fiercest of them becomes gentle as a lamb  The natives being again brought to good humour they were presently furnished with such provisions as they wanted and they again embarked on their former project At their first setting out the wind was fair and the weather hot and they proceeded rowing and sailing as occasion required Mr Hall and Dampier taking  it by turns to manage the helm However after two days labour they found that they had steered a wrong course and instead of approaching Sumatra they were but eight leagues from Nicobar They then changed their course but were still so violently opposed by a contrary current that on the third day they had made but little way  On the th the wind freshened and the sky began to be clouded About nine in the morning they had an alarming presage by a circle round the sun which in that climate is an infallible sign of an approaching storm They therefore after some consultation concluded to stand before the wind to whatever land was right ahead and for that purpose they furled their sail settled the yard about three feet above the boat's sides and in this manner prepared to receive the storm About at noon the gale came on and the wind continued increasing all the afternoon The sea swelled to an incredible height and often broke over the little skiff hardly so big as a belowbridge wherry only a small matter deeper but not so wide which had it not been for her outleaguers could not have survived a single moment but the thinness of her body and the firmness of her outleaguers were her security for the stern being high and narrow cut the rolling waves like the edge of a knife and divided their force so that what fell in the skiff came down like a shower and was easily baled out by the Achinese The evening  of this day shewed very dreadful Dampier's own words will best describe his feelings  "The sky looked very black says he being covered with dark clouds the wind blew hard and the sea was already roaring in a white foam about us a dark night coming on and no land in sight to shelter us and our little ark in danger to be swallowed by every wave and what was worst of all none of us thought ourselves prepared for another world I had been in many imminent dangers before now but the worst of them all was but a playgame in comparison with this I must confess that I was in great conflicts of mind at this time Other dangers came not upon me with such a leisurely and dreadful solemnity a sudden skirmish or engagement was nothing when the blood was warm and pushed forwards with eager expectations but here I had a lingering view of approaching death and little or no hopes of escaping it and I must confess that my courage that had hitherto kept up failed me here and I made very sad reflections on my former life and looked backward with horror and detestation upon actions which before I disliked but now I trembled at the remembrance of them I had long before this repented me of that roving course of life but never with such concern as now In this temper of mind submitting ourselves to God's good providence and taking all the care we could to preserve our lives  Dampier his Companions in their Canoe overtaken by a dreadfull Storm  Mr Hall and I took turns to steer and the rest took turns to heave out the water and thus we provided to spend the most doleful night I ever was in About o'clock it began to thunder lighten and rain but the rain was welcome to us having drank up all the water we brought from the island The wind at first blew harder than before but within half an hour it became more moderate and the sea assuaged of its fury And then by a lighted match of which we kept a piece burning on purpose we looked on our compass to see how we steered and found we varied but little from our intended course and finding our vessel lively enough with that small sail which was abroad we began to bear up to the true point to which our views were directed But about two in the morning we had another gust of wind with thunder lightning and rain which obliged us again to put before the wind The hard rain soaked us so thoroughly that we had not one dry thread about us and the cold rain chilled us extremely for any freshwater is much colder than the seawater and much more unwholesome for man's body In this wet starving condition we spent the tedious night Never did poor mariners on a leeshore more earnestly long for the dawning light than we did At length the day appeared but with such dark black clouds near the horizon that the first glimpse of the dawn appeared dreadful  We continued our course before the wind till eight in the morning of the th and then one of our Achinesian friends cried out  Pulo Way  We thinking the fellow had said  Pull Away  were at a loss to conceive his reason but presently observing his motions we found he pointed to his companions to shew them land We dropping with wet cold and hungry were overjoyed at this sight It bore south and the wind was still at west a strong gale yet with our small fail no bigger than an apron we changed our course and bore up to it Here our outleaguers did us great service and though our boat's side was pressed down very much we could brook it well enough and next day we ran to the mouth of a river in the island of Sumatra called Passange Jonca where all fell ill of fevers of which some died and I that survived was a whole year before I recover'd my strength"  Here they staid ten or twelve days and were kindly entertained because the Achinese told the natives that they were prisoners on board the pirate as well as themselves and that they were all set ashore together Hall and Dampier were strongly importuned to stay to assist in improving their navigation but longing to get home they chose to be conveyed to the English factory at Achin a vessel was therefore provided for them and in three days they arrived safe Three days after their arrival the Portuguese  died and Ambrose lived but a short time after him Dampier and Mr Hall after passing examination were kindly entertained by Mr Driscal an Irish gentleman interpreter to the factory and the four Achinese were restored to their families and friends  Dampier was so drenched by a Malayan doctor that he never expected to survive the effects of the potions he prescribed yet after more than sixty evacuations from one dose he gathered strength daily and after his health was a little restored both Hall and he undertook to sail with Captain Bowry to Nicobar This Capt Bowry was the gentleman who sent the letter from Sumatra to Mindanao already spoken of which involved a double mistake Bowry imagined an English factory to subsist at Mindanao and the English at Mindanao from Bowry's letter imagined there had been an English factory at Sumatra They sailed from Achinroad the beginning of June but a storm coming on they presently returned About this time Captain Welden arrived from Fort St George and Dampier engaged to sail with him to Tonqueen in China and afterwards made a voyage to Malacca His next ramble was to Fort St George and after his return from thence he came to Bencouli an English factory on the west coast of Sumatra from whence about the beginning of he set out on his return to England  After his return to Achin from his voyage to Malacca he found there one Mr Morgan formerly  belonging to the Cygnet who was then mate of a Danish ship belonging to Tranquebar and being curious to know the sequel of the adventures of his old companions was told by Morgan that when they left Nicobar they directed their course to Ceylon but not being able to weather that island they were forced to seek refreshment on the coast of Coromandel where they began to form new projects but their schemes not succeeding about half their number left them among whom were Morgan and Coppinger who both were entertained in the Danish service and two or three others repaired to Fort St George but the main body went up the country and listed in the army of the Great Mogul where a few of them continued orderly for some time but Oliver the quartermaster and a party with him soon left the camp and rambled about plundering and robbing the villages and flying whenever they were pursued  Captain Read having thus lost the better half of his men after having filled his water and got rice sailed again still intending for the Red Sea He had taken off Ceylon a rich Portuguese ship and had plundered her of what he liked but not being able to bear up against the westerly winds he stood for the island of Madagascar There after various adventures Captain Read with half a dozen of his followers slipt away from the rest of the company and embarked in a ship for New York  Captain Teat succeeded Captain Read in the command and having joined Captain Knight of whom mention has been made before they sailed some time in company but the Cygnet proving leaky Knight gave her the slip on which she returned again to Madagascar and finally sunk in St Augustin bay  While Dampier was at Fort St George there arrived a ship from Mindanao laden with clovebark on board of which came Mr Moody as supercargo This gentleman while at Mindanao purchased the Prince of Meangis of whose country mention has already been made in the former part of this relation This unfortunate Prince with his mother and some attendants had been driven off their own coast by a storm and had been seized at sea by some Mindaneian fishermen who brought them to Mindanao and sold them for slaves a common practice among savage islanders The Prince attracted the notice of Mr Moody by the curious manner in which he was painted and which by Dampier's description exactly corresponds with that of tataowing among the New Zealanders His design was to have brought him over with him to England but Mr Moody speaking the Malayan language and being otherwise well qualified to manage the company's affairs at a new factory he was persuaded by the Governor of Fort St George to accept of the Chief ship of Indrapore in the room of Mr Gibbons who had just resigned in order to return home Upon this unexpected  promotion Mr Moody importuned Dampier to go with him to be his gunner and in order to encourage him thereto promised to purchase a small vessel to carry the Prince and his mother to their own country and to send him as Commander with full power to establish a commerce with Meangis which could not fail of turning greatly to the advantage of all concerned This was a generous and friendly offer which Dampier could not refuse and accordingly he embarked in a company's coasting ship in which there were seven or eight officers passengers and about soldiers for the new factories They had a pleasant passage till they came upon the west coast of Sumatra when a storm arose by which they were driven from their intended port and forced to make the harbour of Bencouli At Bencouli they were all very kindly received and the gunner of that fort being just dead Dampier was offered the post with a more ample salary than Mr Moody in a newlyestablished factory could venture to allow Dampier consented to accept of this appointment provided Mr Moody approved of it and Mr Moody not being certain of being able to fulfil his engagement so far as the same related to the Prince of Meangis very readily gave Dampier leave to contract with the Governor of Bencouli and at the same time assigned to him a halfshare in the two slaves the Prince and his mother that he might not  be a sufferer by leaving Fort St George to follow him  Matters being thus accommodated Mr Moody repaired to his station at Indrapore and Dampier with the two slaves continued at Bencouli They lived at a house in the town and Dampier was accommodated in the fort All this passed in but before the year was expired Dampier grew tired of his office and wanting to get home applied to the Governor and Council for his discharge The Council thought it highly reasonable that his request should be granted and the Governor made no opposition there being at that time no ship in readiness to carry him off but as he had foreseen when the  Defence  Captain Heath bound for England came into harbour he then made many excuses and at length absolutely refused to permit him to go In vain did Captain Heath remonstrate and in vain also did Mr Goddard the chief mate interest himself in Dampier's releasethe Governor was inflexible The  Defence  had touched at Indrapore before she put into Bencouli and Mr Moody had consigned the other halfshare of the slaves to Mr Goddard on having been previously acquainted by letter from Dampier of his intention to sail for England In consequence of this assignment the Prince who some time before had been attacked with an infectious distemper of which his mother died and of which he was but just recovered was put on board the  Defence  and it was privately agreed  between Captain Heath and Dampier that if the latter could make his escape the former would undertake to carry him safe off Accordingly when all the company's business was completed and the letters put on board notice was given to Dampier of the precise time when the ship was to sail  "and says he after several assays I slipt away at midnight and creeping through one of the portholes of the fort I got to the shore where the ship's boat waited for me and carried me on board"  On the th of January they set sail for the Cape of Good Hope and the wind being fair they proceeded at first very successfully but they had not been long at sea before the men began to droop being attacked with a distemper that stole insensibly upon them and before they thought themselves ill were ready to die Dampier attributes this fatal disorder to the badness of their water which was filled from a river fed by many noxious streams from the low swampy lands that in the dry season as it were drained their dregs into it which at times were as black as ink Besides it was stowed among the pepper in the hold which heated it to that degree that every morning when the men went to take their allowance it was so hot they could hardly bear to hold a bottleful of it in their hands  "a thing scarce to be credited says Dampier that water should be ready to boil in a ship's hold"  This distemper was so universal that not a man in the ship was wholly  unaffected by it so that when the wind blew a hard gale there wanted hands to work the ship  Captain Heath pitying the condition of his men distributed every day among them a quantity of tamarinds some jars of which he had brought with him from India and this was a very seasonable relief but the wind coming south and the passage being already protracted to an unusual length the Captain called the whole ship's crew together to consult what was best to be done in the present extremity and desired every man from the highest to the lowest to deliver his opinion freely Thus all circumstances being duly considered it was unanimously agreed at last notwithstanding the wind was then contrary to prosecute their voyage to the cape But as that determination would infallibly require a more than ordinary exertion of labour from those that were well to supply the place of those that were sick the Captain promised a month's extra pay to every man who should assist on all occasions that should require help whether it was his watch or not and this premium he engaged to pay at the cape This offer was first accepted by the Officers and then as many men as were capable of duty entered themselves upon the roll In a short time it pleased God says Dampier to favour us with a fair wind which being improved to the best advantage by the incessant labour of those newlisted men wafted us in a short time to the cape and being brought safe to an anchor by the assistance  of Dutch sailors who unbent the sails and did every thing for us they were required to do the sick were presently sent on shore where they remained about six weeks and all but three or four recovered  On the d of May they sailed from the cape in company with the James and Mary and the Josiah Indiamen They directed their course towards the island of St Helena and met with nothing remarkable except a swelling sea which taking them on the broad side rolled every thing about that was loose between the decks and in the hold This great tumbling sea took them soon after doubling the cape  "an eminent token says Dampier that the southwest winds were now violent in the higher latitudes towards the South Pole we having fine clear weather all the while"  On the th of June they arrived at Santa Helena where they staid four or five days and afterwards continued their voyage to England without any remarkable incident and arrived safe in the Downs Sept  What advantage Dampier and his partner Mr Goddard made of their painted prince is not related but they certainly sold him to be carried about the country to be shewn for money He was painted all down his breast between his shoulders on his thighs and round his legs and arms like bracelets  "I cannot says Dampier liken the drawings to any figure of animals or the like but they were very curious full  of great variety of lines flourishes chequeredwork and innumerable convolutions keeping a very graceful proportion and appearing very artificial even to the wonder of all that beheld him"  It has already been remembered that the mother of the Prince died in India of the infectious disorder of which he was but just recovered when he embarked for Europe On that occasion Dampier did what he could to comfort Jeoly for that was the name they gave him but he took on extremely insomuch that it was feared he could not have long survived on which account a grave was immediately dug to hide the dead body out of his sight and being shrouded decently with a piece of fine new calico the corpse was about to be interred but Jeoly was not satisfied till he wrapped all his mother's cloaths about her and two new pieces of chintz that Mr Moody gave her saying they were her's and she must have them After this he suffered her to be interred which was done with great solemnity but he continued to pine after her during the whole time he continued in India  In the printed relation that was given of him when he was shewn for a sight the showmen heightened their account with a romantic story of a beautiful sister of his being a slave with him at Mindanao and of the Sultan's falling in love with her and taking her to his bed but these were stories indeed They reported also that the paint with which he was ornamented  was of such virtue that serpents and all venomous creatures would fly from him but poor Jeoly was as much afraid of serpents scorpions and centipedes as a little child for he was exceedingly timorous He died at Oxford but Dampier does not tell the year  The publication of the above voyage round the world having recommended Dampier to the notice of persons of the first eminence he was afterwards employed by government in discoveries both in the Eastern and Southern Seas His first expedition was to the coast of New Holland which could have no other object but discovery in view He sailed from the Downs on Jan in his Majesty's ship the Roebuck carrying only guns and men and having months provisions on board On the st of August they fell in with the western coast of New Holland in lat deg S where however they found nothing very different from what Dampier had before described The only land animals they saw were a small sort of racoons different from those of the WestIndies chiefly in their legs which are short before and on which they run jumping and a sort of guano's or lizards peculiar to the country which appear to have two heads but in reality have but one and no tail and what is no less remarkable their four legs seem to be all forelegs so formed as that the creature may walk either way To these may now be added the kanguroo a quadrupede of a particular shape as large as a  sheep and a creature of the oppossum kind discovered by Mr Banks with dogs and wolves seen by the Endeavour's crew of the latter sort some were seen by Dampier's men but so lean that they were nothing but skin and bone In latitude deg S they saw dolphins and small whales and abundance of scuttleshells swimming in the sea  Captain Cook found plenty of water on the east side of this island but Dampier was much distressed for want of it on the west side Being ashore employed in digging a well he was assaulted by ten or twelve of the natives with whom he had a skirmish and was forced to shoot one of them dead to disengage a young man who was surrounded by three of them and wounded in the cheek with a lance On a gun's being fired over the heads of the assailants though it startled them at first they soon recovered their surprize and continued their hostilities but as soon as they saw a man fall they were terribly frightened and fled with precipitation Dampier very humanely adds that he attempted the natives no farther being very sorry for what had happened  Among the natives engaged on this occasion there was one who by his appearance and carriage seemed to be the chief of them He was a young brisk man not very tall nor so personable as some of the rest though more active and courageous He was painted with a circle of white pigment about his eyes and a white streak  down his nose from his forehead to the tip of it his breast and some part of his arms were also made white with the same paint not for beauty or ornament as it should seem but as some wild Indian warriors are said to do to make themselves look more terrible in war He was indeed a very frightful being for the manner in which he was painted adding to his natural deformity gave him more the appearance of a monster of the woods than of a man born of a woman Dampier in this second voyage to New Holland confirms what he said of the natives in his first that they are the worst featured savages he ever beheld Captain Cook on the contrary or his editor assures us that their features are not disagreeable their noses are not flat nor are their lips thick their teeth are white and even and their hair naturally long and black but universally cropt short in general it is straight but sometimes has a small curl their beards are of the same colour with their hair bushy and thick which they shorten by singeing they are of the middle stature in general well made clean limbed remarkably vigorous active and nimble their countenances not altogether void of expression and their voices remarkably soft and effeminate Such are the different descriptions given by voyagers of the same people or to speak more precisely of people on the east and west side of the same continent for which it is not easy to account  Our voyager however not being able either to find fresh water or a harbour to careen his ship set sail from this miserable country about the beginning of September and directing his course to the island of Timor arrived there September and received a supply of water and provisions from the Chief of the Dutch factory there He was likewise hospitably entertained by the gentlemen of the Portuguese factory on the same island From thence he sailed to the coast of New Guinea traded with the inhabitants and ranging along the coast found the main land divided into two parts To the easternmost division he gave the name of New Britain  In his return back he touched again at Timor and from thence sailed to Batavia where having careened his ship and supplied himself with necessaries of every kind on the th of October he set sail for the Cape of Good Hope from thence continuing his voyage to St Helena he arrived at that island January but in his course home his ship sprung a leak at sea and after endeavouring in vain to stop it he was obliged to run her aground on the island of Ascension where having landed his men and taken from on board all necessary provisions they in a short time discovered a fine spring of water and lived tolerably till they were at last relieved by some English menofwar who were convoying home the Canterbury Indiaman and brought them all safe to England  In notwithstanding the bad success of the voyage just mentioned Dampier was again employed in an expedition to the South Sea in conjunction with Captain Pulling who had each a ship of guns and men under his command That commanded by Captain Dampier was called the St George and that by Captain Pulling the Fame They were victualled for nine months and had commissions from his Royal Highness Prince George of Denmark then Lord High Admiral to proceed in a warlike manner against the French and Spaniards and both were upon the same terms of  No purchase no pay  But while they were in the Downs some difference having arisen between the two Captains Captain Pulling set sail alone and left Dampier to take his own course who stopping some time in Ireland was joined by the Cinque Ports galley of tons guns and men Captain Charles Pickering Commander In this expedition Dampier had three grand objects in view the  first  was to sail to Buenos Ayres in order to surprize the Spanish galleons that usually take in their lading at that port the  second  depended on missing the first in which case they were to pass through the straits of Magellan to cruise upon the coasts of Peru for the Baldivia ships that carry gold to Lima and the  third  was only to take place if both the former miscarried and was to proceed to the coast of Mexico to intercept the Manilla ship that annually arrives at Acapulco and is said to be  worth eight or nine millions of pieces of eight equal to a million and a half of our money  Full of these projects they set sail from Kinsale in Ireland on the th of September and on the th arrived off Madeira where they learned that the galleons were sailed from Buenos Ayres and then lay at Teneriff The first project being thus defeated they proceeded to put the second in execution with all possible dispatch On the th of November they anchored on the island Le Grand on the coast of Brazil where they buried Captain Pickering and chose Lieutenant Stradling in his room  From this island they sailed the th of December and doubling Cape Horn on the th of January they changed their direction sailed to the northward and on the th of February came to an anchor in the great bay of Juan Fernandez where they met their consort Captain Stradling with whom they had parted in passing Cape Horn in a violent storm which happened on the th of January  At Juan Fernandez they continued refitting their ships till the th when seeing a sail they slipt their cables and put to sea She proved to be a French ship of tons guns and full of men The St George fought her about seven hours when a gale springing up she sheered off On this occasion the Cinque Ports behaved but indifferently firing only a few guns and lying by  Next day in returning to Juan Fernandez they fell in with two French menofwar of guns each from whom they narrowly escaped leaving their cables anchors and five or six of their men belonging to the Cinque Ports on that island with a new suit of sails and several other necessaries which they could ill spare  They now proceeded upon their second enterprize but they were equally unfortunate in that as in the former The Baldivian ships were sailed and the gold secured They then meditated a surprize against the town of Santa Maria in the gulph of Panama where the Spaniards getting intelligence of their designs laid ambuscades and after killing and wounding several of them put the rest to flight  In this manner disappointments succeeding disappointments differences began to arise between the Commanders and they concluded to part company But about this time a large ship fortunately for them coming to an anchor in the night close by them they instantly boarded and made prize of her She was deeply laden with flour sugar brandy wine about thirty tons of malmalade of quinces a considerable quantity of salt with some tons of linnen and woolencloth This proved a seasonable supply and provisions that were before so scarce that only five green plantains were the daily allowance for six men were now so abundant on board the prize that they might have laid in a stock for several years yet in less than six months we find them starving  After rummaging the prize and dividing the spoil the Captains parted and in two or three days Dampier fell in with a Spanish manofwar fitted out on purpose to take him The two ships had a smart engagement and parted in the night by consent  Soon after this engagement Dampier and Clippington his first Lieutenant having some difference Clippington seized upon the ship's tender in which were the stores and ammunition and with of the best men weighed anchor and set sail When he had cleared the islands he sent to invite all those who were willing to sail with him to come on board but Dampier's last project being now on the point of being carried into execution the men who remained with him resolved to abide the issue Clippington though he had quarrelled with the Captain had no mind to distress the men he therefore thought fit to restore the powder and ammunition reserving only enough for his own use In the bay of Tacames Dampier had taken a small bark of tons laden with plantains This bark they intended to keep as a tender She had two masts with two square sails and they named her the Dragon  The Master of this bark Christian Martin by name was a Spaniard by birth but taken prisoner while he was a boy and bred up in England This man they kept prisoner on board and now proceeded to intercept the Manilla ship  On the th of December in the morning they saw a sail and soon came up with her She proved their last hope the great Manilla ship from the EastIndies They instantly bore down upon her and before she could bring her guns to bear gave her several broadsides and taking her unprepared put the company on board in the utmost disorder Captain Martin though a Spaniard advised to lay her aboard immediately before the Spaniards had recovered their surprize but that advice was disregarded till it was too late for while two parties were quarrelling on board the St George the one for laying the enemy on board the other not the Spaniards got out a tier of pounders every one of which that took place was ready to send the St George to the bottom The assailants were therefore soon beaten off with disgrace after having received a shot between wind and water in the powder room by which two feet of planking was driven in on each side the stern And now being disappointed of this their last expectation all the men grew discontented and impatient to return home However they were prevailed upon to cruise a few weeks longer on the coast of Mexico and with that view passed the ports of Acapulco Port Angels Port Guatulco and several others but without meeting with any prize worth waiting for  Ill success is generally succeeded by discontent the men who were before impatient of fatigue without reward grew now ungovernable  A party therefore formed the design of returning home by way of the EastIndies and these were encouraged by Mr Funnel the chief mate who having the command of the small Spanish prize alreadly mentioned determined to hazard every thing to regain his native country rather than continue under the direction of a man with whom there was no keeping terms He therefore embraced the first opportunity to reach the gulph of Amapalla to newwater his bark and prepare for his voyage home  It should seem that this voyage of Dampier though countenanced with a government commission was notwithstanding fitted out by private adventurers for on this occasion the owners agent is said to have divided the provisions and stores between those who chose to remain with Dampier and those who determined to follow the fortune of Mr Funnel Their whole number was already reduced to effective men of whom chose to accompany Funnel and only remained with Dampier but upon what terms they engaged or what course they pursued afterwards we are not told for Dampier though he returned home never published any account of this voyage What we have related concerning it in order to complete his adventures as far as our materials extend we have extracted from the account published by Funnel who having left Dampier in the gulph of Amapalla on the st of February takes no farther notice of his Captain but goes  on with the story of his own voyage which was indeed unfortunate enough for his ship was seized by the Dutch at Amboyna the goods on board confiscated and most of the men cruelly used being confined and halfstarved by our good friends the Dutch who were jealous lest they should make discoveries prejudicial to their commerce Funnel himself however soon got released and having made strong representations against the authors of his sufferings at Amboyna he at length obtained some shew of redress with which though not a compensation for his losses he was forced to be contented On the d of November he with two of his company got passage to Europe in the Dutch EastIndia fleet and on the th of July following arrived safe in the Texel from whence after visiting the principal towns in Holland he came to England and published the account just mentioned in which he followed the example of Dampier by giving a description of the natural productions of the islands at which he touched their inhabitants arts and commerce  We can find no traces of the latter part of the life of Dampier who seems to have been an able navigator but of a restless turbulent spirit like the ocean on which he was bred He certainly possessed the art of sailing in a very eminent degree but he wanted that happier art of conciliating the wavering discordant passions of his followers and associates He seems too to have been more cautious than brave more subtle  than wise and more enterprizing than fortunate In all his engagements both as an inferior officer and as a commander he seems neither to have braved danger nor to have feared it It is not easy to determine whether his thirst for gold or desire of knowledge was the governing principle that led him to range the world for new discoveries If the former he seems totally to have failed in the pursuit if the latter he was more successful At Mindanao we find him poor at the Bashee islands he laments the want of every article that could purchase from the natives a small specimen of the yellow metal that bore the resemblance of gold but withal so honest that he would neither take the iron belonging to the owners of the ship to give in exchange nor would he take the metal from the inhabitants without an equivalent In short I think we may conclude from what he himself has written that Dampier was a man of strong natural parts of blunt manners of quick discernment inflexible in his resolutions but deficient in natural qualities to command respect and in acquired abilities to maintain it  THE VOYAGE OF MASTER COWLEY ROUND THE WORLD  OF Master Cowley we can find no other account than what is contained in the voyage written by himself therefore we shall in his own words preserve such parts of that voyage as have not already been related in the voyage of Dampier premising only that his first setting out among the buccaneers was in the same prize in which Dampier set sail from Virginia under the command of Captain Cook that he continued to serve that Commander as Master during his life and that after sailing sometime in consort with Captain Eaton in the South Seas he chose rather to serve that gentleman than to continue with his own Captain's successor One remark more and then to proceed We find him in every collection of voyages in which he is introduced distinguished by the appellation of CAPTAIN Cowley though the highest employment to which he ever seems to have arrived was Master on board the buccaneers beforementioned who during the time they were suffered to commit their ravages traversed the globe as wolves the forest  merely for the sake of whom they might devour We find however but few of them successful by far the greatest part like other robbers died miserably and such of them as escaped with life were at certain times exposed to sufferings not less shocking to human nature than the distresses to which they reduced innocent people by their cruelty and lust for gold But now to proceed  In August I departed says Cowley from Cape Charles in Virginia lying in latitude deg N and in longitude deg in the good ship called the Revenge Captain John Cook Commander pretending to me that I should navigate the ship to Petitguavaz where a Frenchman was the Governor and to which port I began to shape my course but was told as soon as we had left the shore that they were now bound for the coast of Guinea to provide a better ship and that then their design was to sail to the Great South Sea I was thereupon obliged to alter my course and to steer E S E for the Cape de Verd Islands in lat deg N  In the month of September we made the island of Salt where we came to an anchor careened our ship and afterwards sailed to St Nicholas where was held a consultation of officers whether to sail directly for the South Seas in their present ship or pursue their former resolution and proceed to the coast of Guinea to seek a better After much debate it was at length concluded to try St Jago another of the  Cape de Verd islands and if any ship was found in that road fit for their purpose to lay her on board and make her their prize  On our approach to this island on the eastern side we descried a large ship from the masthead which proved to be a Dutch East Indiaman of guns and as we afterwards learnt of men most of whom were on shore but on seeing us stand towards the road they instantly repaired to their posts clapt a spring upon their cable heaved their broadside to us struck out their ports below and running out their lower tier of guns made themselves ready to receive us We had now advanced too near but marking their force and that it was in vain to attempt a conquest we put before the wind and steered directly to the coast of Guinea where we had no sooner arrived than we fell in with a new ship of guns which we boarded and carried away Upon examination we found her well stored with brandy water and provisions and in order to furnish her with other necessaries from our old ship we put into Sherborough resolving to touch at no other port till we should come to Juan Fernandez in lat deg min S  About the beginning of December we sailed from latitude deg N steering S W till we arrived in deg S when we steered away S W by W till we came into soundings on the coast of Brazil and finding fathom water in a sandy bank we altered our course to the S W and about the latitude of deg S found the  sea as red as blood occasioned by great shoals of shrimps which coloured the ocean for many leagues together We found also a multitude of seals and such abundance of small whales as to exceed the number found in the North Seas in the proportion of one hundred to ten We held on our course till we came into lat deg where we saw land never before discovered It proved an uninhabited island to which I gave the name of Pepy's island and at which ships may conveniently wood and water having a harbour where sail may ride in safety In this island we saw plenty of fowls and round it there is no doubt abundance of fish but it blowing a storm we could neither dare to approach it nor to examine its coasts We therefore stood to the southward shaping our course S S W till we came into the latitude of deg S and then steering S W by W resolving not to attempt the straits of Magellan but to make the land of Ter del Fuego and there finding great riplings and apprehending danger we resolved to attempt the passage discovered by Bartholomew Sharp in and to sail round all leaving Staten land to the N With this view hauling away S W we came abreast of Cape Horn on the th of February where chusing valentines and discoursing of the witchcraft of women there arose a prodigious storm which continued till the last day of the month driving us into latitude deg min which is farther than any ship ever yet sailed to  the south so that we concluded that talking of the wiles of women at sea was very unlucky discourse  About the beginning of March the wind coming to the south we were soon wafted into a warmer climate for in the th deg the weather was so extremely cold that we could bear drinking three quarts of burnt brandy a man in fourandtwenty hours without being the least intoxicated We steered northbyeast till we came into lat deg S where we fell in with the Nicholas of London Captain John Eaton Commander and being glad of each others company we sailed in consortship to the island of Juan Fernandez where we found plenty of good fat goats good fish wood and water Here Cowley relates the story of the Moskitoman the account of which has already been given by Dampier This island is naturally fortified so that with men and at l expence it may be defended from the attacks of men in case of an invasion Accordingly the Spaniards have taken the hint for when the last ships sailed upon discoveries they found it fortified It lies leagues due west from the port of Valparayso  We steered from this island northnortheast till we made the high land of Arica in latitude deg S Being before the bay the officers of both ships held a consultation whether best to go into Aricabay or proceed farther on the coast when it was resolved to sail as low down  Cowley his Men taking in Provisions at the Island of Iuan Fernandez  at Cape Blanco and there wait for the Spanish platefleet coming to the bay of Panama This was an unfortunate resolution for in Aricabay rode at that time a ship with tons of silver on board which we missed and in the room of her took a timbership bound to Lima with hands on board which at that time stockt us with more mouths than we could well spare meat to fill With this ship we sailed away north to the island of Lobos in lat deg S where we set our sick men on shore though we could neither find wood or water upon it Here having heeled our ships at a general council it was resolved to attack the town of Truxillo in lat deg N ten miles within land and with this view just as we were weighing anchor to proceed some of our people from the mast head espied three sail of ships passing by which we instantly ran out and took These ships were all laden with flour fruit and sweetmeats but having had intelligence that we were upon the coast they had left all their silver their silverservice plate not excepted on shore Their provisions however were very acceptable and we now thought only of seeking a proper place to lay up our stores in security and where we might conceal ourselves for five or six months to make the enemy believe that we had forsaken their seas and that they had nothing to fear from fresh attacks On this occasion the islands called by the Spaniards Gallapagoes or Enchanted Islands were proposed and the only objection made was  the uncertainty of finding them but that being overcome we weighed anchor and after three weeks sail came in sight of them being seventeen in number to all which I gave distinct names We came to an anchor in a very good harbour lying towards the northernmost end of a fine island under the Equinoctial Line in which we found plenty of fish sea and landtortoises fowls of various sorts among which were turtledoves so tame at first that they would often light upon the hats and shoulders of our men as they walked abroad but not being able to satisfy their hungry appetite by catching them alive the sailors so scared them at last by frequently firing upon them that they became like other birds very shy  This island I called the Duke of York's Island near to which lies a small island which being viewed in several directions always assumed a different shape This I called Cowley's Enchanted Island I examined several others but upon none of them found freshwater save only upon the Duke of York's Island The bay in which we anchored I called Albany bay and the harbour Yorkroad and after having laid up bags of flour with a quantity of sweetmeats and other provisions in a convenient storeroom we sailed to the northward to try for fresh water a second time lest being distressed we should be forced upon some future occasion to seek relief in other harbours when it might not be possible for us to reach the present but we  found good water in none of them and to our great surprize we met with such a violent current that when we would have returned to the Duke of York's Island we could not stem it and we were obliged to bear away N N E when the first land we made upon the main was Cape Trespontas upon the easternmost shore of which we watered our ship The first day after our arrival we buried our Captain the second day three Spanish Indians came down whom our men brought on board Being strictly examined concerning the strength and opulence of the town of Ria Lexa they gave very satisfactory answers but while they were under examination our longboat being sent on shore to get beef a party of Spanish Indians came down and set their boat on fire and drove the crew for shelter upon a rock where they were forced to remain till we sent another boat with men to rescue them  We retained the three Indians and led them with ropes about their necks as guides to conduct us afterwards to Ria Lexa but one of them having got his neck out of the collar made his escape and alarmed the town so that our men returned very much discouraged at this second disappointment We now found it necessary to turn all our prisoners away to shift for themselves and then directed our course to the gulph of St Miguel where we took two islands one inhabited by Indians the other plentifully stocked with cattle but for gold and silver we got but little Here we staid and careened our ships  and here Captain Cook's ship and Captain Eaton's broke consortship and both ships being refitted I got on board Captain Eaton where I was entertained as his master to navigate his ship to any place or port where he should direct  It is now that the voyage of Master Cowley may be said to commence Hitherto he has gone handinhand with Dampier but now Cowley pursues one course with Captain Eaton and Dampier another with Captain Davis the successor of Captain Cook  We in our ship continues Cowley towards the middle of August set sail from the gulph of Miguel in the bay of Amapalla steering for Cape St Francisco where we chaced a ship that escaped from us and then we bore up to latitude deg S where finding the country alarmed we stood for Payta in lat deg S where we took two ships lying at anchor which the Spaniards refusing to ransom we by way of farewel set them on fire From hence we sailed to Gorgona at which island we watered our ship for the East Indies  This island lies in lat deg min N and in long deg E and as soon as we had supplied ourselves with wood and water we took our departure steering W N W till we came as low almost as the rocks of St Bartholomew in long deg then we sailed into lat deg N till we judged we were past those rocks and then returned into deg N which latitude we held till we made the island of Guam in lat  deg N and in long deg E according to our reckoning at which island when we arrived we had a very sickly ship no man being free from the scurvy and most of us in a consuming condition It was on the th of March about seven in the morning that we saw land At o'clock we were in lat deg min N by observation having made out on our sailing by judgment miles that is to say departed so many miles from Gorgona by loss made out in longitude which is about leagues The next day we sailed about the southwest part of the island and came to an anchor in a fair bay from whence we sent a boat on shore with a flag of truce but on landing our people found that the natives had burnt their houses and had fled however our men felled some cocoanut trees and brought a hundred or two of them on board to refresh the crew In the mean time a party of Indians rushed from behind the bushes and in a hostile manner threatened to attack us but we made signs of friendship and one of the Indians returned to the wood and having peeled a stick so as to make it appear white he came forward when one of his companions perceiving that he had no cap to compliment our people called him back and presented him with one for that purpose  From Sunday the th till Tuesday the th we continued a free trade with the Indians but on that day our men going over to a small island on the west side of Guam the Indians fell upon  them with stones and lances which occasioned a fray in which some of the Indians were killed upon the spot  Two days after the Governor who happened to be a Spaniard came to a point of land near the ship and sent a letter written in Spanish French and Dutch demanding in the name of the King his Master who we were whither we were bound and from whence we came Our answer was written in French that we were employed by some gentlemen in France upon the discovery of the unknown parts of the world On the return of the messenger the Governor sent a letter of invitation to the Capta  n to come on shore with which he instantly complied and was received under a triple discharge of cannon from the fort which was answered by the same number of guns from the ship They soon came to a good understanding Our Captain made an apology for killing some of the Indians in his own defence and the Governor gave for answer that if he had killed them all he should have esteemed the favour the greater We were afterwards told that the Indians on the small island were in rebellion  On Wednesday about o'clock a Spanish Captain came on board and continued with us till the next day He brought as a present from the Governor hogs a large quantity of potatoes plantains oranges papas and red pepper in return for which our Commander  sent the Governor a diamondring and presented the Officer with a rich sword  The next day the Governor sent on board a captain a Jesuit and a friar with a request to our Commander to spare him some powder of which he was in want This request was readily complied with we sent him four barrels and offered him four great guns The first he thankfully received and sent a box in which were pieces of eight in gold and silver for the Captain to pay himself for the powder but the guns he politely declined accepting Our Captain returned the box with the money untouched and afterwards received from the Governor a valuable present  While mutual civilities were passing between the Governor and our Captain our people went out every day chasing the Indians whom they had full licence to kill and destroy wherever they met with them but they finding us not to be Spaniards became very tractable and offered to assist in supplying us with fish and fruit which they exchanged with us for old nails and old iron After having tarried here sometime and a free intercourse had been established between the Indians on shore and our people on board the ship the Indians made signs for as many of our men as chose it to come and see them haul the seine Our men not suspecting any design manned the boat and went to look at them but while the men were amusing themselves with the sport the Indians had very  artfully brought their seine round the boat with a design to draw it on shore and thereby entangle both boat and crew but the sailors discovering the plot gave the Indians no time to carry it into execution for being provided with firearms which they never went ashore without they fired amongst the thickest of them killed a great many and drove the rest away  These Indians are large in stature some of them being seven feet and a half high they go stark naked never bury their dead but let them lie in the sun to rot They have no arms but slings and lances the sharp ends of the latter are pointed with dead mens bones which being cut like scoops and jagged at the edges like unto saws if a man happens to be wounded by them and is not cured in nine days he certainly dies Our people took four of these treacherous savages prisoners bound them and brought them on board but they had not been long among us before three of them leapt into the sea and with their hands tied behind them swam away like fishes However we sent the boat after them and found that a strong man at the first blow could not penetrate their skins with a cutlass One of them in my judgment had received bullets in his body before he died and the last of the three that was killed swam a good English mile not only with his hands tied behind him but with his arms pinioned before he expired  The Spanish Governor's kindness increased in proportion to the mischief done to the Indians He sent us the succeeding day by one of his captains thirty hogs some melons pumpkins potatoes fruits and rice and received in return six small patararoes  Having now new rigged our ship and supplied ourselves with wood and water we began to prepare for our departure On the first of April we weighed anchor and next day came abreast of the fort which we saluted with three guns and were complimented with the same number and on the d the Governor sent his last present to our Captain On the th we set sail and steered W by S till we arrived at the height of St Bartholomew when we shaped our course W N W till we came into the latitude of deg min N where we fell in with a cluster of islands lying to the north of Luconia distant from Guam leagues They seemed to be uninhabited but the men who went ashore in the boat found abundance of nutmegs on one of them and saw some goats  From these islands we steered S W for the island of Luconia and on the th of April Cape Bajadore bore from us east after which we came up with Cape Mindato where the S W monsoon overtaking us we were obliged to bear away for Canton in China where we lay and refitted our ship and where we might have laden ourselves with plunder from thirteen Tartar ships who came thither full of the richest goods  of China but our men being under no government refused to attack them saying They came for gold and silver not to be made pedlars to carry packs But alas had reason prevailed we might have all made our fortunes without injuring any prince or subject in christendom for these goods the Tartars had taken from the Chinese about two years before and had stored them at Macao an island near Canton to be taken away when they judged it convenient  From Canton we sailed for Manilla to wait for the Tartar ship that annually goes thither and which we were informed was laden one half with silver but tho' we were fortunate enough to come in sight of her yet she outsailed us and escaped We then bore away for an island that lies to the north of Luconia intending there to stay till the wind came fair to carry us to Bantam not then knowing that Bantam had been taken from the English by the Dutch  At this island we stored ourselves with fruit goats and guanos which last are here good meat and here we found an Indian who directed us to an island where there was plenty of great cattle but the wind soon coming fair we made sail to the southward steering our course S S W till we came into lat deg N where we were so entangled among the islands of Paragoa that none of us ever expected to escape with life After three days however we very  providentially got clear and stood in for an island at the north end of Borneo where we hauled our ship ashore and erected a tent planting a battery of ten guns for our defence in case of an attack from the natives Here we unloaded our ship and having provided sufficiently for our security we ranged the country for natives to trade with us but they having never seen any white men before were very shy and when by chance our men fell in with one of their canoes that was full of women among whom was the queen of the country and her retinue on the approach of our ship's boat they all leapt overboard but after taking them up and treating them kindly they laid aside their fears and grew familiar and upon our offering them civility instead of avoiding they soon became fond of us They brought us fish in great plenty with oranges lemons mangoes plantains and pineapples and besides these we exchanged some trifles for bezoar musk and civet with which the island is well stored  The year was now drawing to a close when we set sail from this little island directing our course for Timor where finding the ship's company begin to grow mutinous and not under command of their Captain myself Mr Hill and eighteen more joined our forces together and purchased a large boat in which we sailed to the island of Java distant from Timor leagues The wind being contrary to carry us to Batavia we bore away for Cheribon a factory  belonging to the Dutch lying eastward of Batavia where we were kindly received by the Governor There we heard that King Charles was dead and that his brother James was proclaimed king we heard also that Bantam had been taken from the English and that the Dutch had erected a new factory in that island  After refreshing at Cheribon we agreed to divide our twenty men into three parties two of which chose to sail for the bay of Bengal and the third to stay with me but knowing that Batavia was the Hollander's magazine for India we proposed first to sail thither and there to provide for ourselves as well as we could Being all arrived we were courteously received by the General and I with Mr Hill and another friend who were all my party were promised our passage to Europe in their EastIndia fleet About this time the General was sending four or five ships of war with soldiers to procure satisfaction from the King of the island for an outrage that had been committed on a party of Hollanders who to the number of had been slaughtered by the Javanese These ships it seems were originally designed against Sillebar an English settlement on the west coast of Sumatra but this act of hostility happening to intervene it had diverted their purpose and saved the factory for this time There were now in Batavia twenty of us who on hearing this news would willingly have repaired to Sillebar but the Dutch would by no means permit  us though we had bought a sloop for that purpose When we were just ready to sail the General ordered our sloop to be seized and when we remonstrated against this incivility they produced an old law by which the subjects of the republic in India are forbidden to sell any vessel to any foreigner and they even went so far as to imprison those who had transgressed it To us indeed they gave the prime cost of the sloop but paid us nothing for fitting her up  This project failing Mr Hill another friend and I embarked on board the  Solida  Indiaman bound to Holland and as we were putting out of the road we saw our ship Captain John Eaton coming in however we held our course but finding the wind unfavourable we turned down to Bantam to take in provisions and from thence steered to Prince's Island where we lay for a fair wind three weeks About the end of March we set sail from thence with the wind at N W and shaped our course to the Cape of Good Hope On the th of May after a pleasant passage we made the land called Point Primicra bearing from us N W distant leagues We had the wind at N E being distant from the cape miles the land trending away S W by W The fish which came about the ship near the island of Mona the th of March left us now when we judged ourselves in latitude deg min S From the th of May to the th we had sailed only miles but observing next day we found by our latitude that we  had a very strong current that had driven our ship to the southward miles farther than we judged ourselves to be for we thought we had been in the latitude of deg min S whereas we found ourselves in lat deg min S our course having been S W miles I argued the reason with the chief mate of the ship and he told me it once happened in this place that they lay atrie with three mainsails and the wind at W S W three days and when they took their observation they found the ship driven to windward English miles and likewise in lat deg min they say they often find the like  From hence to the th nothing remarkable happened but on that day we had the wind very furious blowing a storm from W S W We lay atrie with our mainsails and found we were in lat deg min S coming in with the land and now the current went to the eastward and we began to fear lest we should lose our passage by the cape Our Captain who had long been sick was now judged to be past recovery and in the middle of the night died this occasioned a great deal of confusion and to add to our difficulties our water began to fail and we were reduced to a pint a day per man Next day we heaved our Dutch Captain's corpse overboard when a council ofwar was called wherein it was resolved that Captain Tominall Commander of the Critsman should command the Solida and that Captain Tominall's chiefmate  should command the Critsman The pilot also of the Solida whose name was Houdin was ordered on board the Critsman but he refused to go and the men assembled tumultuously and declared they would not part with him The Lord Van Heldine was in a great rage with the steersman but the crew were resolute and he was obliged to yield  On the st of June we again came in sight of land It appeared like a round hill flat at top and bore from us N N E with a smaller hill to the eastward of it Next day we were before the harbour of the cape with the wind at north and fine fair weather On the d at night we came to an anchor in the bay before the castle in nine fathom water Three days before we lost sight of the Critsman in the hard gale but this day we saw a sail at sea and concluded that it must be the Critsman Here we heard that the Francis Maria was lost with men on board and here likewise we were told that the King of England had taken the Duke of Monmouth and that he was beheaded Another piece of news we learned was that a Portuguese carrac was cast away upon the reef having on board four millions of guelders in gold sent as a present from the King of Siam to the King of Portugal and that four Dutch ships had likewise struck upon the same reef but that they had fortunately escaped with very little damage  This day four of the natives came down to the city dancing naked and offering their wives  to the Hollanders for little bits of tobacco They were the filthiest men I ever saw Next day my two friends and I walked about the town in which are about houses built very low to save them from the boisterous gales of wind that blow here in the months of December January and February but the Dutch have here a strong castle with guns well mounted and a spacious garden with pleasant walks and planted with almost every kind of fruit flowers and herbs This is the greatest rarity that we saw at the cape We walked moreover without the town to the village inhabited by the Hodmandods so called by the Hollanders who are the natives of the country These people are said to be born white but make themselves black by anointing their bodies and exposing their infants to the sun and smoke Their houses or huts are built round like the cabbins in Ireland of the wild Irish with the fireplace in the middle round which they all lie in common covered only with the skins of some beast and without any other bed than the ashes of the wood on which they dress their meat They eat any thing that is foul and will gather from the dunghills the offal that is thrown out by the Dutch to feed their dogs Their men are not at all jealous of foreigners but will beat their wives unmercifully for lying with their neighbours When the women marry they cut off a joint of the middlefinger and if the husband dies and the widow marries again she cuts off another joint  and so many men as they marry so many joints of their singers they lose They are supposed to worship the moon because at the full and change they assemble in great numbers dancing and rejoicing when she shines but howling and lamenting when they are deprived of her light  It happened while we were at the cape that one of the Hodmandods drank himself dead at the fort of which his countrymen getting intelligence they assembled about him and with oil and milk endeavoured to recover him but finding all their efforts vain and that they could perceive no spark of life remaining they began to make preparations for his funeral which they performed in the following manner They first brought knives and shaved him from head to foot then digging a hole in the ground they carefully placed him in a sitting posture with his body and head erect and his legs and thighs stretched out horizontally and pressed down streight this being performed they propt him up in this attitude with stones and then came a company of their women to howl over him who accompanied their lamentations with a hideous shrieking as if death appeared before them in the shape of a monster and was ready to devour them After their time of mourning was over they filled up the hole with earth and covered it over with the green turf  During the time of our stay at the cape our people were chiefly employed in cleansing and scouring the ship in fishing her masts and in  fitting and trimming her rigging We also took in wood and water supplied ourselves with fresh provisions and on the th of June when the wind came fair we were ready to sail  We were now three ships in company the Solida and Critsman who came together from Batavia and the Emeland who came from Bengal On Tuesday the th we pursued our course to the N W and N W by W till Tuesday the th without any material incident intervening We had no observation but I judged we were in lat deg min S This day it was that I spoke with an Englishman on board the Emeland that had been some time in the Dutch service who told me that they came out in company with two English ships one named the Resolution the other the Defence with both of whom they had parted in a storm on the coast of Coromandel that the Resolution was leaky and that there were little hopes of her crew's being able to keep her above water He told me likewise that there were several Englishmen in the King of Siam's service that the English EastIndia Company was but little regarded by the Moors but that the interlopers were very much encouraged and that one Mr Deane being their Chief lived in great splendor never going out without or Moors to attend him  We had moreover this day great feasting on board us the Commanders of the other ships being invited to an entertainment But while  the men were loading the guns to pay the usual salute they were alarmed by a strange voice from the sea crying out  Come help come help a man overboard  on which they forthwith brought the ship to thinking to take him up but they neither saw nor heard any more of him Enquiry was then made through all the ships if any of them had lost a man but upon the strictest examination it appeared that every ship had her proper complement so that they concluded it was the spirit of some man that had been drowned in that latitude by accident  On the th of July another very wonderful incident very much astonished our company When we left Batavia we took a shegoat on board which had then two young kids about three weeks old This creature was observed to grow bigger every day and all that our people could conjecture was that it proceeded from the unwholesomness of the water that made her swell but to the astonishment of all of us she now brought forth four young ones although no male had been on board  On the th of July we threw one man overboard who died the night before though no one knew of his being ill He was an old Dane who having no body on board to take care of his effects those who first perceived he was dead fell to rummaging his chest to secure to themselves what he had saved but as in like cases they could not agree about dividing the plunder the matter came to the knowledge of the Captain  who made the thieves give up all they had stolen which he took under his own care for the benefit of his family  On the th of July we came up with the Island of Ascension and next day took a new departure from thence On the th we found we were in lat deg N And now a councilofwar was called upon our Captain His accusation was that he had formed a conspiracy with five men more to murder a person of quality and his lady with some other passengers on board and that when the murders were accomplished they were to seize upon their riches and run away with the ship The purser was the chief accuser but upon examination the whole charge seemed so improbable and the man who broached the story denying upon the trial what he had confidently affirmed before to the purser the Captain was honourably acquitted and the villain punished  Wednesday the d we made out in longitude from the cape deg min judging ourselves to be in long deg min And no wit was that I cut the same Line which I did when I departed from Virginia in the year having encompassed the globe and cannot but note that I have been farther southward than any man that I ever heard or read of before me in this voyage having as I have already said reached as far as lat deg min S and so it happened that being bound to go north about Scotland to make Holland I passed about  deg north though I mention this as no extraordinary thing  We met with no extraordinary occurrence till the d of August when our Captain after three days illness died of a pain in his bowels His chief steersman was made Commander in his room but though his cause was warmly espoused by the men on a former occasion yet it was not till after much opposition that they acquiesced in his present advancement  On the th of September about at night we had a violent storm and we had like to have been on board the Critsman and by endeavouring to avoid it had well nigh overset our own ship  On Sunday the th when the weather began to clear up I saw land as did also two men more I supposed it to be the island of Shetland but our Captain would not believe it however about six in the evening the Critsman's people saw land also and let go the flag which nettled our Captain who blamed his own incredulity  We came up with the Isle of Farley by the d steered on and on the th had the wind all round the compass About this time we came up with a Scotch ship who steered so that we ran her on board on her quarter and had we not slackened sail should certainly have sunk her Two passengers leapt into our ship to save their lives but they happened to be more afraid than hurt The ship was called the Lion of Leith and the crew told us that the Turks lay at Plymouth  and Dartmouth where they had victualled and careened and from whence they had occasionally slipt out and had taken sail of Hollanders and among them a Dutch frigate of guns which gave occasion to many hard speeches against the English nation though we found afterwards that the whole was an idle story framed only to amuse the Dutchmen and to flatter their humour by belying the English  On sailing next day with the wind at E S E we found ourselves in latitude deg min N and I judged us to be on the Westbank At the same time we came up with two ships one a Dane the other an Englishman from London with whom I sent my quadrant and with whom myself and my two friends would willingly have gone if our Dutch lord would have given us leave but he told us he could not answer the letting us go to his Masters the StatesGeneral  On Tuesday the th we came before the Maes with the wind at E N E When it was day we saw the Brill Church and came to an anchor in fathom water On the th we got bread and beer on board Next day we entered the harbour at Helvoetsluys after we had been seven months in our passage from Batavia Three days after our arrival one of my two mates died and I made no great stay here but went to Rotterdam where I found the Anne yacht In her I came passenger for England and through the infinite mercy of God arrived at London October following  Of Cowley's history as we can know nothing but from this relation of his voyage so it is not easy either to form a judgment of his capacity or of his acquirements He seems to have been an excellent navigator as we do not find in the whole course of his pursuits either that he was ever at a loss in finding the ports he sought or that the ships of which he had the direction were ever in danger of being cast away The nature of his employment in a subordinate station led him rather to a habit of obedience than of opposition and therefore his quitting the ship in which it was his choice to sail is more to be wondered at than that he should steal away from his company at Batavia with only two friends Perhaps his conduct on this occasion might be owing to principle for of the enormities committed by the buccaneers with whom he was engaged Cowley must be acquitted because he was drawn into their service by stratagem and a strong proof of his honesty is his embracing the first fair opportunity of deserting them  We know there are writers and those of no mean credit who have taken pains to justify the practices of the buccaneers and who have attributed to their discoveries and to their exploits the advancement of the art of navigation and the emolument of their country but it neither appears to us that their discoveries were of any consequence in a national sense or that the riches they brought home were a counterbalance  for the lives that were sacrificed in the acquisition  Their discoveries were chiefly of lurkingplaces to which they were forced to retire to escape the pursuit of the enemy and as to the treasures they acquired they were generally purchased with the lives of many brave men who had they been employed in honest commerce would have gained profit to themselves and honour to their country  It is not from the temporary excursions of a banditti that a nation can hope to become rich nor is it by a hasty race round the world that the art of navigation is to be improved The improvements of art are slow in their progress and the acquisition of national wealth can only be obtained by a steady perseverance in industry and commerce It is therefore the true interest of every commercial nation to discountenance plunderers and to applaud those only who are employed in cultivating the arts of peace  ough the following relations may see  to our design of g  ng  of the dis  overi  of our Engl  sh navi  y  we have judged them too curious  omitted  Dutch  Relat  of ROGGE  'S Discover  of  Easter Island    we permitted him to go into his boat again  depart Two days afterwards the whole sea  covered with the savage inhabitants of  who came swimming round the ship  multitudes that we neither could  it adviseable to land They clam  ke cats up the ship's sides with the  and came aboard where they did  appear t  be in the least afraid of us but  surp  zed at the largeness  ext  of our ships and rigging and could  conce  ve the meaning of all that they

propensity of  rob and steal if they were not  from it Rusty nails old iron and whate  lay hold on was equ  the  with which th  y jumped overboard  They at  empted with their  of the ship but these  too fast for them These huge fellows came at last aboard in such numbers that we were hardly capable to keep them in order or keep a watchful eye upon their motions and the quickness of their hands so that fearing they would become too many for us we used our best endeavours to get rid of them in a friendly way but they not seeming inclinable to leave us we were obliged to use harsher methods and drive these savages out of the ships by force  "On the th of April we made for the island in our boats well armed in order to land and take a view of this country where an innumerable company of savages stood on the sea side to guard the shore and obstruct our landing they threatened us mightily by their gestures and shewed an inclination to await us and turn us out of their country but as soon as we through necessity gave them a discharge of our muskets  and there brought one of them to the g  ound they lost their courage They made the most surprizing motions and gestures in the world and viewed their fallen companions with the utmost astonishment wondering at the wounds which the bullets had made in their bodies whereupon they hastily fled with a dreadful howling dragging the dead bodies along with them so the shore was cleared and  in safety  "These people do not go naked as many  savages do every person is cloathed in  colours of cotton and worsted curiously  woven or stitched but nothing  +comes them more than their ears which  abominably long and in most of them  upon the shoulders so that though they them+selves look upon this as the greatest ornament they appeared very uncouth to us who were  +accustomed to such the more so as there  in them such extravagantly large holes  openings that we could easily put our  through them  "Thus far my narrative will gain credit because it contains nothing uncommon yet I  declare that all these savages are of a more  gigantic size for the men are twice as tall an  thick a  the largest of our people they  +ed one with another the height of twelve  so that we could easily who will not wonder  it without stooping have passed betwixt  legs of these sons of Goliah According to the  ght so is their thickness and are all one with another very well proportioned so that ea  could have passed for a Hercules but none of the  wives came up to the height of the men being commonly not above ten or eleven fee  ▪ The men had their bodies painted with a red  dark brown and the women with a scarlet colo  "I doubt not but most people who read  voyage will give no credit to what I now  and that this account of the  eight of these  will probably pass with them  fiction but this I declare I have  going but the real truth and that this people upon the nicest inspection were in fact of such a surpassing height as I have here described  "After the inhabitants of Easter Island had made trial of the strength of our weapons  have before related they began to the  more civil manner and brought us f  om  all kinds of vegetables sugar canes with yams plantains and a great quantity of fowls which came very a propos and tended to refresh us greatly  "What I have seen of the worship and idols of these savages is very wonderful Two stones of a largeness almost beyond belief served them for gods the one was broad beyond measure and lay upon the ground upon this stood the other stone which was of such extent and height that seven of our people with outstretched arms would hardly have been able to encircle it so that it appeared to me and all others impossible that this stone could have been lifted up and placed upon the other by the inhabitants of these islands how large and strong soever they might be for besides the thickness it was fully as high as three men About the top of this  there was cut or carved the shape of a  head adorned with a g  which was  together in th  manner of inlaid work made  all stones in a manner not very improper  name of the la  est idol was called Taurico  the other Dago at least these were the words  they called to them by and wherewith they worshipped them  "These savages had great respect for the  idols Taurico and Dago and approached them with great reverence namely with dancing shooting jumping and clapping of hands  the same manner as we read in holy writ  the children of Israel worshipped the golden ca  which  aron set up and when the cannon of which they seemed to be in great terror were discharged and the heavy shot founded in the  eurs they made surprizing and wonderful gestures and leaps and pointed with their fingers first to our people and then to their gods whom they appeared to supplicate for help against  and to call upon with a frightful shout  howling of Dago▪ Dago  "Wh  le we say before this Easter Island a heavy tempest surprized us which pressed so much on the ships that I had no thought but that they would drive from their anchors and we with them come to a miserable end on thi  coast which God prevented the storm being at last appeased without having done any damage to the ships  "On the  th of April leaving this island we put to sea again and shaped our course to the westward  "On the  th of May we came into the lati+tude of  deg  here we fell in wi  a great  together  so that we were of opinion they had been joined together in former times and composed one solid piece of land but separated from one another afterwards by a pressure of the waters Among these an island appeared above the rest the most stately and eminent intersected by  ny rivers and springs of water which there  e was christened Water Island by Schouten and Le Maire who discovered it in on their voyage to the Terra Australis In this labyrinth of islands and rocks we had the woeful misfortune to lose one of our ships the African Galley which struck upon the rocks and beat to pieces It may be accounted however a happy circumstance that all the people aboard were saved and brought off and being d  led among the two remaining ships were a r  nforcement to their crews It was impossible  or the ships to approach very near the land where no anchoring ground was to be found  low sandy and rocky island being in the inland parts almost all drowned land but upon the borders it is full of trees among which n  ther palmetto or cocoanut trees were to be found which I believe is the reason of its not  inhabited nevertheless five of our men  went ashore willingly remained on the  and would not return again to the ships  wearied out with the hardships they had  and fearing many more unfore  were  ll awaiting them The loss  abovementioned ship would be a happy  circumstance for them since from the wrec  and what would be drove ashore  ight  supplied with arms and all other nec  ies  "On the th of May we passed by the isla  of Flies al  o discovered by the foresaid Schoute  in his above mentioned voyage The inla  parts of it are likewise full of salt water and  abounds in great plenty of wild green trees  is inhabited by savages of a large stature  w  th bows and arrows The island was ve  properly named from the incredible quanti  of nasty flies wherewith it is covered which and come aboard and fall so thick or the face  other parts of the body that one is at a loss to conceal himself from them and every thing one eats or drinks is full of them they put  for two or three days when  uninvited guests

procure refreshments when the inhabitants who saw us approach from afar came  own upon the shore to make us return back and to prevent our  landing They are people of an excellent shape well proportioned and comely in person and what is surprizing their skin is as  clear and whit  as that of a native of Holland  They seemed to shew a resolution to stay for us for as soon as we came near they jumped like madmen into the water to meet us and pushed with great  with their weapons which consisted of  and lances whose points were armed with  sharp wood as hard as iron wherefore  ing obliged to free ourselves and preserve our  from this hostile attack we fired upon them  our muskets which made those savage war  immediately take to their heels and oblig  to look out for a place of safety for as  they had tasted the deadly effects of these  pons they turned their backs upon us and  a high steep rock which they scrambled  like monkies with incredible swiftness  "From thence being convinced of our supe  r force they gave us to understand that all  ostilities should cease on their part and they  ould treat with us as friends and on our side we used every means to allure them to us being  the utmost want of all manner of refreshments  very thing succeeded according to our wishes they brought us their commodities consisting of cocoanuts and a certain bitter herb of the taste of Dutch cresses which is found here in great pl  nty For these we gave them in exchange several trifles and trinkets such as small look  ngglasses glass beads of all colours combs  bells and a number of such toys of little value  which they were as well and even better pl  d than we were with  cocoanuts and bitter  bs which however were much more  have understood from this that those barbarians
