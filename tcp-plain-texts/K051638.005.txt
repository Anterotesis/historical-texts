 UpperFLask Hamstead Friday June    morn    o'clock  _I AM now here and here have been this hour and half What an industrious spirit have I Nobody can say that I eat the bread of idleness I take true pains for all the pleasure I enjoy I cannot choose but to admire myself strangely for certainly with this active soul I should have made a very great figure in whatever station I had filled But had I been a prince To be sure I should have made a most  noble  prince I should have led up a military dance equal to that of the great Macedonian I should have added kingdom to kingdom and robbed all my neighboursovereigns in order to have obtained the name of  Robert the Great  And I would have gone to war with the Great Turk and the  Persian and the Mogholl for their Seraglios for not one of those Eastern Monarchs should have had a pretty woman to bless himself with till I had done with her  And now I have so much leisure upon my hands that after having informed myself of all necessary particulars I am set to my shorthand writing in order to keep up with time as well as I can For the subject is now become worthy of me and it is yet too soon I doubt to pay my compliments to my charmer after all her fatigues for two or three days past And moreover I have abundance of matters preparative to my future proceedings to recount in order to connect and render all intelligible  I parted with the captain at the foot of the hill trebly instructed that is to say as to the  Fact  to the  Probable  and to the  Possible  If my beloved and I can meet and make up without the mediation of this worthy gentleman it will be so much the better As little foreign aid as possible in my amorous conflicts has always been a rule with me tho' here I have been obliged to call in so much And who knows but it may be the better for her the less she makes necessary I cannot bear that she should sit so indifferent to me as to be in earnest to part with me for ever upon so  slight  or even upon  any  occasion  If I find she is  But no more threatenings till she is in my powerThou knowest what I have vowed  All Will's account from the lady's flight to his finding her again all the accounts of the people of the house the coachman's information to Will and so forth collected together stand thus  The Hamstead coach when the lady came to it had but two passengers in it But she made the fellow go off directly paying for the vacant places  The two passengers directing the coachman to set them down at the UpperFlask she bid him set her down there also  They took leave of her very respectfully no doubt and she went into the house and asked If she could not have a dish of tea and a room to herself for half an hour  They shewed her up to the very room where I now am She sat at the very table I now write upon and I believe the chair I sit in was hers  O Belford if thou knowest what Love is thou wilt be able to account for these  minutiae  She seemed spiritless and fatigued The gentlewoman herself chose to attend so genteel and lovely a guest She asked her If she would have bread and butter to her tea No She could not eat They had very good biscakes As she pleased The gentlewoman stept out for some and returning on a sudden she observed the sweet fugitive endeavouring to restrain a violent burst of grief which she had given way to in that little interval  However when the tea came she made her sit down with her and asked her abundance of questions about the villages and roads in that neighbourhood  The gentlewoman took notice to her  that she seemed to be troubled in mind  Tender Spirits she replied could not part with  dear  friends without concern  She meant  me  no doubt  She made no inquiry about a lodging tho' by the sequel thou'lt observe that she seemed to intend to go no farther that night than Hamstead But after she had drank two dishes and put a Biscake in her pocketSweet soul to serve for her supper perhaps she laid down halfacrown and refusing change sighing took leave saying she would proceed towards Hendon the distance to which had been one of her questions  They offered to send to know if a Hamstead coach were not to go to Hendon that evening No  matter she saidPerhaps she might meet the chariot  Another of her  feints  I suppose for how or with whom could any thing of this sort have been concerted since yesterday morning  She had as the people took notice to one another something so uncommonly noble in her air and in her person and behaviour that they were sure she was of quality And having no servant with her of either sex her eyes her fine eyes the gentlewoman called them stranger as she was and a woman being swelled and red they were sure there was an elopement in the case either from parents or guardians for they supposed her too young and too maidenly to be a married lady And were she married no husband would let such a fine young creature be unattended and alone nor give her cause for so much grief as seemed to be settled in her countenance Then at times she seemed to be so bewildred they said that they were afraid she had it in her head to make away with herself  All these things put together excited their curiosity and they engaged a  peery  servant as they called a footman who was drinking with Kit the hostler at the taphouse to watch all her motions This fellow reported the following particulars as they were rereported to me  She indeed went towards Hendon passing by the sign of the Castle on the heath then stopping looked about her and down into the valley before her Then turning her face towards London she seemed by the motion of her handkerchief to her eyes to weep repenting who knows the rash step she had taken and wishing herself back again  Better for her if she do Jack once more I say Woe be to the girl who could think of marrying  me yet be able to run away from me and renounce me for ever  Then continuing on a few paces she stopt again and as if disliking her road again seeming to weep directed her course back towards Hamstead  I am glad she wept so much because no heart bursts be the occasion for the sorrow what it will which has that kindly relief Hence I hardly ever am moved at the sight of these pellucid fugitives in a fine woman How often in the past twelve hours have I wished that I could cry most confoundedly  She then saw a coach and four driving towards her empty She crossed the path she was in as if to meet it and seemed to intend to speak to the coachman had he stopt or spoke first He as earnestly looked at  her  Every one did so who passed her so the man who dogg'd her was the less suspected  Happy rogue of a coachman hadst thou known whose notice thou didst engage and whom thou mightest have obligedIt was the divine Clarissa Harlowe at whom thou gazedstMy own Clarissa HarloweBut it was well for me that thou wert as undistinguishing as the beasts thou drovest otherwise what a wildgoose chace had I been led  The lady as well as the coachman in short seemed to want resolution the horses kept on the fellow's head and eyes no doubt turned behind him and the distance soon lengthened beyond recall With a wistful eye she looked after him sighed and wept again as the servant who then slily passed her observed  By this time she had reached the houses She looked up at every one as she passed nowandthen breathing upon her bared hand and applying it to her swelled eyes to abate the redness and dry the tears At last seeing a bill up for letting lodgings she walked backwards and forwards half a dozen  times as if unable to determine what to do And then went farther into the town and there the fellow being spoken to by one of his familiars he lost her for a few minutes But soon saw her come out of a linendrapery shop attended with a servantmaid having as he believed bought some little matters and as it proved got that maidservant to go with her to the house she is now at  See Vol  iv  p      The fellow after waiting about an hour and not seeing her come out returned concluding that she had taken lodgings there  And here supposing my narrative of the dramatic kind ends Act the First And now begins  ACT II  SCENE  Hamstead Heath continued  Enter my Rascal  WILL having got at all these particulars by exchanging others as frankly against them which I had formerly prepared him with both verbally and in writing I found the people already of my party and full of good wishes for my success repeating to me all they told him  But he had first acquainted me with the accounts he had given them of his lady and me It is necessary that I give thee the particulars of his taleAnd I have a little time upon my hands for the maid of the house who had been out of an errand tells us that she saw Mrs Moore with whom must be my first business go into the house of a young gentleman within a few doors of her who has a maiden sister Miss Rawlins by name  so notify'd  for prudence that none of her acquaintance undertake any thing of consequence without consulting her  Mean while my honest coachman is walking about Miss Rawlins's door in order to bring me notice of Mrs Moore's return to her own house I hope her  gossipstale will be as soon told as mine Which take as follows  Will told them before I came  That his lady was but lately married to one of the finest gentlemen in the world But that he being very gay and lively she was  mortal  jealous of him and in a fit of that sort had eloped from him For altho' she loved him dearly and he doated upon her as well he might since as they had seen she was the finest creature  that ever the sun shone upon  yet she was apt to be very wilful and sullen if he might take the liberty to say sobut truth was truthand if she could not have her own way in every thing would be for leaving him That she had three or four times played his master such tricks but with all the virtue and innocence in the world running away to an intimate friend of hers who tho' a young lady of honour was but too indulgent to her in this her  only  failing for which reason his master had brought her to London lodgings their usual residence being in the country And that on his refusing to satisfy her about a lady he had been seen with in the park she had for the first time since she came to town served his master thus Whom he had left halfdistracted on that account  And truly well he might poor gentleman cried the honest folks pitying me be ore they saw me  He told them how he came by his intelligence of her and made himself such an interest with them that they helped him to a change of cloaths for himself and the landlord at his request privately inquired if the lady actually remained at Mrs Moore's and for how long she had taken the lodgings Which he found only to be for a week certain But she had said that she believed she should hardly stay so long And then it was that he wrote his letter and sent it by honest Peter Partrick as thou hast heard  When I came my person and dress having answered Will's description the people were ready to worship me I nowandthen sighed nowandthen put on a lighter air which however I designed should shew more of vexation illdisguised than of real chearfulness And they told Will It was a thousand pities so fine a lady should have such  skittish tricks  adding that she might expose herself to great dangers by them for that there were Rakes everywhere  Lovelace's in every corner Jack  and many about that town who would leave nothing unattempted to get into her company And altho' they might not prevail upon her yet might they nevertheless hurt her reputation and in time estrange the affections of so fine a gentleman from her  Good sensible people theseHay Jack  Here landlord one word with you My servant I find has acquainted you with the reason of my coming this way An unhappy affair landlord A very unhappy affair But never was there a more virtuous woman  So Sir she seems to be A thousand pities her ladyship has such waysAnd to so goodhumoured a gentleman as you seem to be Sir  Motherspoilt landlordMotherspoilt that's the thingBut sighing I must make the best of it What I want  you  to do for me is to lend me a great coat I care not what it is If my spouse should see me at a distance she would make it very difficult for me to get at her speech A great coat with a cape if you have one I must come upon her before she is aware  I am afraid Sir I have none fit for such a gentleman as you  O any thing will doThe worse the better  Exit landlord Reenter with two great coats  Ay landlord This will be best for I can button  the cape over the lower part of my face Don't I look devilishly down and concern'd landlord  I never saw a gentleman with a betternatured look 'Tis pity you should have such tryals Sir  I must be very unhappy no doubt of it landlord And yet I am a little pleas'd you must needs think that I have found her out before any great inconvenience has arisen to her However if I cannot break her of these freaks she'll break my heart for I do love her with all her failings  The good woman who was within hearing of all this pitied me much  Pray your honour said she if I may be so bold was madam ever a mamma  Noand I sighedWe have been but a little while married and as I may say to  you  it is her own fault that she is not in that way Not a word of a lye in this Jack But to tell you truth madam she may be compared to the dog in the manger  I understand you Sir simperingShe is but young Sir I have heard of one or two such skittish young ladies in my time SirBut when madam is in that way I dare say as she loves you and it would be strange if she did not all this will be over and she may make the best of wives  That's all my hope  She is as fine a lady as I ever beheld I hope Sir you won't be too severe She'll get over all these freaks if once she be a mamma I warrant  I can't be severe to her she knows that The moment I see her all resentment is over with me if she give me but one kind look  All this time I was adjusting my horseman's coat and Will was putting in the ties of my wig and buttoning the cape over my chin  I ask'd the gentlewoman for a little powder She brought me a powderbox and I lightly shook the  puff over my hat and flapt one side of it tho' the lace look'd a little too gay for my covering and slouching it over my eyes Shall I be known think you Madam  Your honour is so expert SirI wish if I may be so bold your lady has not some  cause  to be jealous But it will be impossible if you keep your laced cloaths covered that anybody should know you in that dress to be the same gentlemanExcept they find you out by your clocked stockens  Well observ'dCan't you landlord lend or sell me a pair of stockens that will draw over these I can cut off the feet if they won't go into my shoes  He could let me have a pair of coarse but clean stirrupstockens if I pleased  The best in the world for the purpose  He fetch'd them Will drew them on and my legs then made a good gouty appearance  The good woman smiling wished me success and so did the landlord And as thou knowest that I am not a bad mimic I took a cane which I borrowed of the landlord and stooped in the shoulders to a quarter of a foot of less height and stump'd away cross to the Bowlinggreen to practise a little the hobbling gaite of a gouty man The landlady whisper'd her husband as Will tells me He's a good one I warrant himI dare say the fault lies not all of one side While mine host replied that I was so lively and so goodnatur'd a gentleman that he did not know who could be angry with me do what I would A sensible fellowI wish my charmer were of the same opinion  And now I am going to try if I can't agree with goody Moore for lodgings and other conveniencies for my sick wife  Wife Lovelace methinks thou interrogatest  Yes  wife  for who knows what cautions the dear fugitive may have given in apprehension of me  But has goody Moore any other lodgings to let  Yes yes I have taken care of that and find that she has just such conveniencies as I want And I know that my wife will like them For altho' married I can do every thing I please and that's a bold word you know But had she only a garret to let I would have liked it and been a poor author afraid of arrests and made that my place of refuge yet would have made shift to pay beforehand for what I had I can suit myself to any condition that's my comfort  THE widow Moore return'd say youDown down fluttererThis impertinent heart is more troublesome to me than my conscience I think I shall be obliged to hoarsen my voice and roughen my character to keep up with its puppily dancings  But let me seeShall I be angry or pleased when I am admitted to my beloved's presence  Angry to be sureHas she not broken her word with meAt a time too when I was meditating to do her grateful justiceAnd is not breach of word a dreadful crime in good folks I have ever been for forming my judgment of the nature of things and actions not so much from what they are in themselves as from the character of the actors Thus it would be as odd a thing in such as we to  keep  our words with a lady as it would be wicked in her to  break  hers to us  Seest thou not that this unseasonable gravity is admitted to quell the palpitations of this unmanageable heart But still it will go on with its boundings I'll try as I ride in my chariot to  tranquillize  Ride Bob so little a way  Yes ride Jack for am I not lame And will it not look well to have a lodger who keeps his chariot What widow what servant asks questions of a man with an equipage  My coachman as well as my other servant is under Will's tuition  Never was there such a hideous rascal as he has made himself The devil only and his other master can know him They both have set their marks upon him As to my Honour's mark it will never be out of  his damn'd wide mothe  as he calls it For the dog will be hang'd before he can lose the rest of his teeth by age  I am gone  LETTER II  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Hamstead  Friday Night June    NOW Belford for the narrative of narratives I will continue it as I have opportunity and that so dextrously that if I break off twenty times thou shalt not discern where I piece my thread  Although grievously afflicted with the gout I alighted out of my chariot leaning very hard on my cane with one hand and on my new servant's shoulder with the other the same instant almost that he had knock'd at the door that I might be sure of admission into the house  I took care to button my great coat about me and to cover with it even the pommel of my sword it being a little too gay for my years I knew not what occasion I might have for my sword I stoop'd forward blink'd with my eyes to conceal their lustre No vanity in saying that Jack my chin wrapt up for the toothach my slouch'd laced hat and so much of my wig as was visible giving me all together the appearance of an antiquated beau  My wife I resolved beforehand should have a complication of disorders  The maid came to the door I ask'd for her mistress She shew'd me into one of the parlours and I sat down with a gouty Oh  Enter goody  Moore  Your servant Madambut you must excuse me I cannot well standI find by the bill at the door that you have lodgings to let Mumbling my words as if like my man Will I had lost some of my foreteeth Be pleased to inform me what they are for I like your situationAnd I will tell you my family I have a wife a good old womanOlder than myself by the way a pretty deal She is in a bad state of health and is advised into the Hamstead air She will have two maidservants and a footman The coach or chariot I shall not have them up both together we can put up anywhere and the coachman will be with his horses  When Sir shall you want to come in  I will take them from this very day and if convenient will bring my wife in the afternoon  Perhaps Sir you would board as well as lodge  That as you please It will save me the trouble of bringing my cook if we do And I suppose you have servants who know how to dress a couple of dishes My wife must eat plain food and I don't love kickshaws  We have a single lady who will be gone in two or three days She has one of the best apartments That will then be at liberty  You have one or two good ones mean time I presume Madam just to receive my wife for we have lost timeThese damn'd physiciansExcuse me Madam I am not used to curse but it is owing to the love I have for my wifeThey have kept her in hand till they are asham'd to take more fees and now advise her to the air I wish we had sent her hither at first But we must now make the best of it  Excuse me Madam for she looked hard at me that I am muffled up thus in this warm weather I am but too sensible that I have left my chamber sooner than I ought and perhaps shall have a return of my gout for it I came out thus muffled up with a dreadful pain in my jaws an ague in them I believe But my poor dear will not be satisfied with any body's care but mine And as I told you we have lost time  You shall see what accommodations I have if you please Sir But I doubt you are too lame to walk up stairs  I can make shift to hobble up now I have rested a little I'll just look upon the apartment my wife is to have Any thing may do for the servants And as you seem to be a good sort of gentlewoman I shan't stand for a price and will pay well besides for the trouble I shall give  She led the way and I leaning upon the banisters made shift to get up with less fatigue than I expected from ancles so weak But oh Jack What was Sixtus the Vth's artful depression of his natural powers to mine when as the halfdead Montalto he gaped for the pretendedly unsought Pontificate and the moment he was chosen leapt upon the prancing beast which it was thought by the amazed conclave he was not able to mount without help of chairs and men Never was there a more joyous heart and lighter heels than mine joined together yet both denied their functions the one fluttering in secret ready to burst its bars for reliefful expression the others obliged to an hobbling motion when unrestrained they would in their master's imagination have mounted him to the lunar world without the help of a ladder  There were three rooms on a floor two of them handsome and the third she said still handsomer but the lady was in it  I sawI saw she was for as I hobbled up crying out upon my weak ancles in the hoarse mumbling  voice I had assumed I beheld a little piece of her just casting an eye with the door ajar as they call it to observe who was coming up and seeing such an old clumsy fellow greatcoated in weather so warm slouched and muffled up she withdrew shutting the door without any emotion But it was not so with me for thou canst not imagine how my heart danced to my mouth at the very glimpse of her so that I was afraid the thump thump thumping villain which had so lately thumped as much to no purpose would have choak'd me  I liked the lodgings well and the more as she said the third room was still handsomer I must sit down Madam and chose the darkest part of the room Won't you take a seat yourself No price shall part us But I will leave the terms to you and my wife if you please And also whether for board or not Only please to take This for earnest putting a guinea into her handAnd one thing I will say My poor wife loves money but is not an illnatured woman She was a great fortune to me But as the real estate goes away at her death I would fain preserve her for that reason as well as for the love I bear her as an honest man But if she makes too close a bargain with you tell  me  and unknown to  her  I will make it up This is my constant way She loves to have her pen'worths and I would not have her vexed or made uneasy on any account  She said I was a very considerate gentleman and upon the condition I had mentioned she was content to leave the terms to my lady  But Madam cannot abody just peep into the other apartment that I may be more particular to my wise in the furniture of it  The lady desires to be private SirButAnd was going to ask her leave  I caught hold of her handHowever stay stay  Madam It mayn't be proper if the lady loves to be private Don't let me intrude upon the lady  No intrusion Sir I dare say The lady is goodhumoured She will be so kind as to step down into the parlour I dare say As she stays so little a while I am sure she will not wish to stand in my way  No Madam that's true if she be goodhumoured as you sayHas she been with you long Madam  But yesterday Sir  I believe I just now saw the glimpse of her She seems to be an elderly lady  No Sir you're mistaken She's a young lady and one of the handsomest I ever saw  Cot so I beg her pardon Not but that I should have liked her the better were she to stay longer if she had been elderly I have a strange taste Madam you'll say but I really for my wife's sake love every elderly woman Indeed I ever thought age was to be reverenced which made me taking the fortune into the scale too  that  I own make my addresses to my present dear  Very good of you Sir to respect age We all hope to live to be old  Right Madam But you say the lady is beautiful Now you must know that tho' I chuse to converse with the elderly yet I love to see a beautiful young woman just as I love to see fine flowers in a garden There's no casting an eye upon her is there without her notice For in this dress and thus muffled up about my jaws I should not care to be seen any more than she let her love privacy as much as she will  I will go ask if I may shew a gentleman the apartment Sir and as you are a married gentleman and not  over  young she'll perhaps make the less scruple  Then like me she loves elderly folks best perhaps But it may be she has suffered by young ones  I fancy she has Sir or is afraid she shall She desired to be very private and if by description inquired after to be denied  Thou art true woman goody Moore thought I  Good lackGood lackWhat may be her story then I pray  She is pretty reserv'd in her story but to tell you my thoughts I believe  Love  is in the case She is always in tears and does not much care for company  Nay Madam it becomes not me to dive into ladies secrets I want not to pry into other peoples affairs But pray how does she employ herselfYet she came but yesterday so you can't tell  Writing continually Sir  These women Jack when you ask them questions by way of information don't care to be ignorant of any thing  Nay excuse me Madam I am very far from being an inquisitive man But if her case be difficult and not merely  Love  as she is a friend of yours I would give her my advice  Then you are a lawyer Sir  Why indeed Madam I was some time at the Bar but I have long left practice yet am much consulted by my friends in difficult points In a pauper case I frequently  give  money but never  take  any from the richest  You are a very good gentleman then Sir  Ay Madam we cannot live always here and we ought to do what good we canBut I hate to appear officious If the lady stays any time and thinks fit upon better acquaintance to let me in to her case it may be a happy day for her if I find it a just one for you must know that when I was at the Bar I never was such a sad fellow as to undertake for the sake of a paltry fee to make white black and black white for what would that have been but to endeavour to establish iniquity by quirks while I robbed the innocent  You are an excellent gentleman Sir I wish and then she sighed I had had the happiness to know there was such a lawyer in the world and to have been acquainted with him  Come come Mrs Moore I think your name is it may not be too lateWhen you and I are better acquainted I may help  you  perhapsBut mention nothing of this to the lady for as I said I hate to appear officious  This prohibition I knew if goody Moore answer'd the specimen she had given of her womanhood would make her take the first opportunity to tell were it to be necessary to my purpose that she should  I appeared upon the whole so indifferent about seeing the room or the lady that the good woman was the more eager I should see both And the rather as I to stimulate her declared that there was more required in my eye to merit the character of a handsome woman than most people thought necessary and that I had never seen six truly lovely ladies in my life  To be brief she went in and after a little while came out again The lady Sir is retired to her closet so you may go in and look at the room  Then how my heart began again to play its pug's tricks  I hobbled in and stump'd about and liked it very much and was sure my wife would I begg'd excuse for sitting down and ask'd Who was the minister of the place If he were a good preacher Who preached at the chapel And if  he  were a good preacher and good  liver  too MadamI must inquire after  That  For I love I must needs say that the Clergy should practise what they preach  Very right Sir but that is not so often the case as were to be wished  More's the pity Madam But I have a great veneration for the Clergy in general It is more a satire upon Human nature than upon the Cloth if  we suppose those who have the  best  opportunities to be good less perfect than other people For my part I don't love  professional  any more than  national  reflectionsBut I keep the lady in her closet My gout makes me rude  Then up from my seat stumped IWhat do you call these windowcurtains Madam  Stuffdamask Sir  It looks mighty well truly I like it better than silk It is warmer to be sure and much fitter for lodgings in the country especially for people in years The bed is in a pretty taste  It is neat and clean Sir That's all we pretend to  Ay mighty wellVery wellA silk camlet I thinkVery well trulyI am sure my wife will like it But we would not turn the lady out of her lodging for the world The other two apartments will do for us at the present  Then stumping towards the closet over the door of which hung a pictureWhat picture is that Oh I see A St Caecilia  A common print Sir  Pretty well pretty well It is after an Italian masterI would not for the world turn the lady out of her apartment We can make shift with the other two repeated I louder still But yet mumblingly hoarse for I had as great regard to uniformity in accent as to my words  O Belford to be so near my angel think what a painful constraint I was under  I was resolved to fetch her out if possible And pretending to be goingYou can't agree as to any  time  Mrs Moore when we can have this third room can youNot that whisper'd I loud enough to be heard in the next room Not that I would incommode the lady But I would tell my wife  when  aboutsAnd women you know Mrs Moore love to have every thing before them of this nature  Mrs Moore says my charmer and never did her voice sound so harmonious to me Oh how my heart bounded again It even talked to me in a manner for I thought I  heard  as well as  felt  its unruly flutters and every vein about me seemed a pulse Mrs Moore you may acquaint the gentleman that I shall stay here only for two or three days at most till I receive an answer to a letter I have written into the country and rather than be your hindrance I will take up with any apartment a pair of stairs higher  Not for the world Not for the world young lady cried IMy wife well as I love her should lie in a garret rather than put such a considerate lady as you seem to be to the least inconveniency  She opened not the door yet and I said But since you have so much goodness Madam if I could but just look into the closet as I stand I could tell my wife whether it is large enough to hold a cabinet she much values and will have with her whereever she goes  Then my charmer opened the door and blazed upon me as it were in a flood of light like what one might imagine would strike a man who born blind had by some propitious power been blessed with his sight all at once in a meridian sun  Upon my soul I never was so strangely affected before I had much ado to forbear discovering myself that instant But hesitatingly and in great disorder I said looking into the closet and around it There is room I see for my wife's cabinet and it has many jewels in it of high price but upon my soul for I could not forbear swearing like a puppy Habit is a cursed thing Jack Nothing so valuable as the lady I see can be brought into it  She started and looked at me with terror The truth of the compliment as far as I know had taken dissimulation from my accent  I saw it was impossible to conceal myself longer from her any more than from the violent impulses of my passion to forbear manifesting myself I unbuttoned therefore my cape I pulled off my flapt slouched hat I threw open my great coat and like the devil in Milton an odd comparison tho'  I started up in my own form divine  Touch'd by the beam of her celestial eye  More potent than Ithuriel's spear  Now Belford for a similitudeNow for a likeness to illustrate the surprising scene and the effect it had upon my charmer and the gentlewomanBut nothing  was  like it or equal to it The plain fact can only describe it and set it off Thus then take it  She no sooner saw who it was than she gave three violent screams and before I could catch her in my arms as I was about to do the moment I discover'd myself down she sunk at my feet in a fit which made me curse my indiscretion for so suddenly and with so much emotion revealing myself  The gentlewoman seeing so strange an alteration in my person and features and voice and dress cried out Murder help Murder help by turns for half a dozen times running This alarmed the house and up ran two servant maids and  my  servant after them I cried out for water and hartshorn and every one flew a different way one of the maids as fast down as she came up while the gentlewoman ran out of one room into another and by turns up and down the apartment we were in without meaning or end wringing her foolish hands and not knowing what she did  Up then came running a gentleman and his sister fetched and brought in by the maid who had run down and who having let in a cursed crabbed old wretch hobbling with his gout and mumbling with his hoarse brokentoothed voice was metamorphosed all at  once into a lively gay young fellow with a clear accent and all his teeth and she would have it that I was neither more nor less than the devil and could not keep her eye from my foot expecting no doubt every minute to see it discover itself to be cloven  For my part I was so intent upon restoring my angel that I regarded nobody else And at last she slowly recovering motion with bitter sighs and sobs only the whites of her eyes however appearing for some moments I called upon her in the tenderest accent as I kneeled by her my arm supporting her head My angel My charmer My Clarissa look upon me my dearest lifeI am not angry with you I will forgive you my best beloved  The gentleman and his sister knew not what to make of all this And the less when my fair one recovering her sight snatched another look at me and then again groaned and fainted away  I threw up the closetsash for air and then left her to the care of the young gentlewoman the same notable Miss Rawlins whom I had heard of at the Flask and to that of Mrs Moore who by this time had recover'd herself and then retiring to one corner of the room I made my servant pull off my gouty stockens brush my hat and loop it up into the usual smart cock  I then stept to the closet to Mr Rawlins whom in the general confusion I had not much minded before Sir said I you have an uncommon scene before you The lady is my wife and no gentleman's presence is necessary here but my own  I beg pardon Sir  If  the lady is your wife I have no business here  But  Sir by her concern at seeing you  Pray Sir none of your  if's  and  but's  I beseech you Nor  your  concern about the  lady  's concern You are a very unqualified judge in this cause and I beg of you Sir to oblige me with your absence  The ladies only are proper to be present on this occasion added I and I think myself obliged to them for their care and kind assistance  'Tis well he made not another word For I found my choler begin to rise I could not bear that the finest neck and arms and foot in the world should be exposed to the eyes of any man living but mine  I withdrew once more from the closet finding her beginning to recover lest the sight of me too soon should throw her back again  The first words she said looking round her with great emotion were O hide me Hide me Is he goneO hide me Is he gone  Sir said Miss Rawlins coming to me with an air somewhat peremptory and assured This is some surprising case The lady cannot bear the sight of you What you have done is best known to yourself But another such fit will probably be her last It would be but kind therefore for you to retire  It behov'd me to have so notable a person of my party and the rather as I had disobliged her impertinent brother  The dear creature said I may  well  be concerned to see me If  you  Madam had a husband who loved you as I love her you would not I am confident fly from him and expose yourself to hazards as she does whenever she has not all her wayAnd yet with a mind not capable of intentional evilBut motherspoilt This is her fault and All her fault And the more inexcusable it is as I am the man of her choice and have reason to think she loves me above all the men in the world  Here Jack was a story to support to the lady face to face too  And here Belford lest thou thro' inattention shouldst be surprised at my assurance let me remind thee and that thus by way of marginal observation that I may not break in upon my narrative that this my intrepidity was but a consequence of the measures I had previously concerted as I have from time to time acquainted thee in apprehension of such an event as has fallen out For had not the dear creature already passed for my wife before no less than four worthy gentleman of family and fortune  Vol  iii  p    And before Mrs Sinclair and her houshold and Miss Partington And had she not agreed to her uncle's expedient that she  should  pass for such from the time of Mr Hickman's application to that uncle  Vol  iv  p    and that the worthy captain Tomlinson should be allowed to propagate that belief as he had actually reported it to two families  they possibly to more  purposely that it might come to the ears of James Harl  we and serve for a foundation for uncle John to build his reconciliationscheme upon  Vol  iv  p    And canst thou think that nothing was meant by all this contrivance And that I am not still  further  prepared to support my story  Indeed I little thought at the time that I formed these precautionary schemes that she would ever have been able  if willing  to get out of my hands All that I hoped I should have occasion to have recourse to them for was only that in case I should have the courage to make the grand attempt and should succeed in it to bring the dear creature and this out of tenderness to her for what attention did I ever yet pay to the grief the execiations the tears of a woman I had triumphed over to bear me in her sight to expostulate with me to be pacified by my pleas and by her own future hopes founded upon the reconciliatoryproject upon my reiterated vows and upon the captain's assurances Since in that case to forgive me to have gone on with me for a week would have been to forgive me to have gone on with me for ever And then had my eligible life of honour taken place her trials would all have been then ever and she would have known nothing but gratitude love and joy to the end of one of our lives For never would I never could I have abandoned such an admirable creature as this Thou knowest I never was a sordid villain to any of her inferiors Her  inferiors  I may sayFor who is not her inferior    You  speak  like a gentleman you  look  like a gentleman said Miss RawlinsBut Sir this is a strange case the lady seems to dread the sight of you  No wonder Madam taking her a little on one side nearer to Mrs Moore I have three times already forgiven the dear creatureBut this  jealousy  There is a spice of  that  in itand of  phrensy  too whispered I that it might have the face of a secret and of consequence the more engage their attention But our story is too long  I then made a motion to go to the lady But they desired that I would walk into the next room and they would endeavour to prevail upon her to lie down  I begg'd that they would not suffer her to talk for that she was accustomed to fits and would when in this way talk of any thing that came uppermost and the more she was suffered to run on the worse she was and if not kept quiet would fall into raveings which might possibly hold her a week  They promised to keep her quiet and I withdrew into the next room ordering every one down but Mrs Moore and Miss Rawlins  She was full of exclamations Unhappy creature miserable ruined and undone she called herself wrung her hands and begged they would assist her to escape from the terrible evils she should otherwise be made to suffer  They preached patience and quietness to her and would have had her to lie down but she refused sinking however into an easy chair for she trembled so she could not stand  By this time I hoped that she was enough recover'd to bear a presence that it behoved me to make her bear and fearing she would throw out something in her exclamations that would still more disconcert me I went into the room again  O there he is said she and threw her apron over her faceI cannot see himI cannot look upon him Begone begone touch me not  For I took her struggling hand beseeching her to be pacified and assuring her that I would make all up with her upon her own terms and wishes  Base man said the violent lady I have no wishes but never to behold you more Why must I be thus pursued and haunted Have you not made me miserable enough already Despoiled of all succour and help and of every friend I am contented to be poor low and miserable so I may be free from your persecutions  Miss Rawlins stared at me A confident slut this Miss Rawlins thought I So did Mrs MooreI told you so whisperingly said I turning to the women shaking my head with a face of great concern and pity and then to my charmer My dear creature how you raveYou will not easily recover from the effects of this violence Have patience my love Be pacified and we will coolly talk this matter over For you expose yourself as well as me These ladies will certainly think you have fallen among robbers and that I am the chief of them  So you are so you are stamping her face still covered She thought of Wednesday night no doubt and sighing as if her heart were breaking she put her hand to her foreheadI shall be quite distracted  I will not my dearest love uncover your face You shall  not  look upon me since I am so odious to you But this is a violence I never thought you capable of  And I would have pressed her hand as I held it with my lips but she drew it from me with indignation  Unhand me Sir said she I will not be touched by you Leave me to my fate What right what title have you to persecute me thus  What right what title my dearBut this is not a timeI have a letter from Captain Tomlinson Here it isoffering it to her  I will receive nothing from your handsTell me not of Captain TomlinsonTell me not of anybodyYou have no right to invade me thusOnce more leave me to my fateHave you not made me miserable enough  I touched a delicate string on purpose to set her in such a passion before the women as might confirm the intimation I had given of a phrensical disorder  What a turn is hereLately so happyNothing wanting but a reconciliation between you and your  friendsThat reconciliation in such a happy train Shall so  slight  so  accidental  an occasion be suffered to overturn all our happiness  She started up with a trembling impatience her apron falling from her indignant faceNow said she that thou darest to call the occasion  slight  and  accidental  and that I am happily out of thy vile hands and out of a house I have reason to believe  as  vile traitor and wretch that thou art I will venture to cast an eye upon theeAnd O that it were in my power in mercy to my sex to look thee first into shame and remorse and then into death  This violent tragedyspeech and the high manner in which she uttered it had its desired effect I looked upon the women and upon her by turns with a pitying eye and they shook their wise heads and besought  me  to retire and  her  to lie down to compose herself  This hurricane like other hurricanes was presently allayed by a shower She threw herself once more into her armed chairAnd begg'd pardon of the women for her passionate excess but not of me Yet I was in hopes that when compliments were stirring I should have come in for a share  Indeed ladies said I with assurance enough thou'lt say this violence is not natural to my beloved's temperMisapprehension  Misapprehension wretchAnd want I excuses from thee  What a scorn was every lovely feature agitated by  Then turning her face from me I have not patience O thou guileful betrayer to look upon thee Begone Begone With a face so unblushing how darest thou my presence  I thought then that the character of a husband obliged me to be angry  You may one day Madam repent this treatment  By my soul you mayYou know I have not deserved it of youYou  know  I have not  Do I know you have not Wretch Do I know  You do MadamAnd never did man of my figure and consideration I thought it was proper to throw that in meet with such treatment She lifted up her hands Indignation kept her silentBut all is of a piece with the charge you bring against me of  despoiling you of all succour and help  of making you  poor  and  low  and with other unprecedented language I will only say before these two gentlewomen that since it  must  be so and since your former esteem for me is turned into so riveted an aversion I will soon  very  soon make you intirely easy I  will  be gone I  will  leave you to  your own fate  as you call it and may That be happyOnly that I may not appear to be a spoiler a robber indeed let me know whither I shall send your apparel and every thing that belongs to you and I  will  send it  Send it to this place and assure me that you will never molest me more never more come near me and that is all I ask of you  I  will  do so Madam said I with a dejected air But did I ever think I should be so indifferent to you However you must permit me to insist on your reading this letter and on your seeing Captain Tomlinson and hearing what he has to say from your uncle He will be here byandby  Don't trifle with me said she in an imperious toneDo as you offer I will not receive any letter from your hands If I see Captain Tomlinson it shall be on his  own  account not on  yours  You tell me you will send me my apparel If you would have me believe any thing you say let This be the test of your sincerityLeave me  now  and send my things  The women stared They did nothing but stare and appeared to be more and more at a loss what to make of the matter between us  I pretended to be going from her in a pet But when I had got to the door I turned back and as if I had recollected myself One word more my dearest creatureCharming even in your angerO my fond soul said I turning half round and pulling out my handkerchief  I believe Jack my eyes did glisten a littleI have no doubt but they didThe women pitied me Honest soulsThey shew'd that they had each of them a handkerchief as well as I So hast thou not observed to give a familiar illustration every man in a company of a dozen or more obligingly pull out his watch when some one has asked What's o'clock  One word only Madam repeated I as soon as my voice had recovered its toneI have represented to Captain Tomlinson in the most favourable light the cause of our present misunderstanding You know what your uncle insists upon and which you have acquiesced with The letter in my hand and again I offered it to her will acquaint you with what you have to apprehend from your brother's active malice  She was going to speak in a high accent putting the letter from her with an open palmNay hear me out MadamThe Captain you know has reported our  marriage  to two different persons It is come to your brother's ears My own relations have also heard of it Letters were brought me from town this morning from Lady Betty Lawrance and Miss Montague Here they are I pulled them out of my pocket and offered them to her with That of the Captain but she held back her still open palm that she might not receive them Reflect Madam I beseech you reflect upon the fatal consequences  which this your high resentment may be attended with  Ever since I knew you said she I have been in a wilderness of doubt and error I bless God that I am out of your hands I will transact for myself what relates to myself I dismiss all your solicitude for me Am I not my own mistressAm I not  The women stared The devil stare ye thought I can ye do nothing but stare It was high time to stop her here I raised my voice to drown hers You used my dearest creature to have a tender and apprehensive heartYou never had so much reason for such a one as now  Let me judge for myself upon what I shall  see  not upon what I shall  hear  Do you think I shall ever  I dreaded her going onI  must  be heard Madam raising my voice still higher You must let me read one paragraph or two of This letter to you if you will not read it yourself  Begone from me ManBegone from me with thy Letters What pretence hast thou for tormenting me thus  Dearest creature what questions you ask Questions that you can as well answer yourself  I  can  I  will  And  thus  I answer them  Still louder raised I my voice She was overborne Sweet soul It would be hard thought I and yet I was very angry with her if such a spirit as thine cannot be brought to yield to such a one as mine  I lowered my voice on her silence All gentle all  intreative  my accent My head bowed one hand held out the other on my honest heartFor heaven's sake my dearest creature resolve to see Captain Tomlinson with temper He would have come along with me But I was willing to try to soften your mind first on this fatal misapprehension and This for the sake of your own wishes For what is it otherwise to me whether your friends are or  are not reconciled to us  Do I want any favour from them  For your own mind's sake therefore frustrate not Captain Tomlinson's negotiation That worthy gentleman will be here in the afternoonLady Betty will be in town with my cousin Montague in a day or two They will be your visiters I beseech you do not carry this misunderstanding so far as that Lord M and Lady Betty and Lady Sarah may know it  How considerable this made me look to the women  Lady Betty will not let you rest till you consent to accompany her to her own seatAnd to that lady may you safely intrust your cause  Again upon my pausing a moment she was going to break out I liked not the turn of her countenance nor the tone of her voice  And thinkest thou base wretch  were the words she  did  utter I again raised my voice and drowned hers  Base wretch  MadamYou know that I have not deserved the violent names you have called me Words so opprobrious from a mind so gentleBut this treatment is from  you  MadamFrom  you  whom I love more than my own soulBy that soul I swear that I doThe women looked upon each other They seemed pleased with my ardor Women whether wives maids or widows love ardors Even Miss Howe thou knowest speaks up for ardors  Vol  iii  p    Nevertheless I must say that you have carried matters too far for the occasion I see you hate me  She was just going to speakIf we are to  seperate for ever  in a strong and solemn voice proceeded I this island shall not long be troubled with meMean time only be pleased to give these letters a perusal and consider what is to be said to your uncle's friend and what he is to say to your uncleAny thing will I come into renounce me if you will that shall make for  your  peace and for the reconciliation your heart was so lately set upon But I humbly conceive  that it is necessary that you should come into better temper with me were it but to give a favourable appearance to what  has passed  and weight to any  future application  to your friends in whatever way you shall think proper to make it  I then put the letters into her lap and retired into the next apartment with a low bow and a very solemn air  I was soon followed by the two women Mrs Moore withdrew to give the fair Perverse time to read them Miss Rawlins for the same reason and because she was sent for home  The widow besought her speedy return I joined in the same request and she was ready enough to promise to oblige us  I excused myself to Mrs Moore for the disguise I had appeared in at first and for the story I had invented I told her that I held myself obliged to satisfy her for the whole floor we were upon and for an upper room for my servant and that for a month certain  She made many scruples and begg'd she might not be urged on this head till she had consulted Miss Rawlins  I consented but told her that she had taken my earnest and I hoped there was no room for dispute  Just then Miss Rawlins return'd with an air of eager curiosity and having been told what had passed between Mrs Moore and me she gave herself airs of office immediately Which I humoured plainly perceiving that if I had  her  with me I had the other  She wished if there were time for it and if it were not quite impertinent in her to desire it that I would give Mrs Moore and her a brief history of an affair which as she said bore the face of novelty mystery and surprize For sometimes it looked to her as if we were married at other times that point appeared doubtful and yet the lady did not absolutely deny  it but upon the whole thought herself highly injured  I said That ours was a very particular case That were I to acquaint them with it some part of it would hardly appear credible But however I would give them as they seemed to be persons of discretion a brief account of the whole and this in so plain and sincere a manner that it should clear up to their satisfaction every thing that had passed or might hereafter pass between us  They sat down by me and threw every feature of their faces into attention I was resolved to go as near the truth as possible lest any thing should drop from my spouse to impeach my veracity and yet keep in view what passed at the Flask  It is necessary altho' thou knowest my whole story and a good deal of my views that thou shouldst be apprized of the substance of what I told them  I gave them in as concise a manner as I was able the history of our families fortunes alliances antipathies her brother's and mine particularly I averred the truth of our private marriage  The Captain's letter which I will inclose will give thee my reasons for that And besides the women might also perhaps have proposed a parson to me by way of compromise  I told them the condition my spouse had made me swear to and which she held me to in order I said to induce me the sooner to be reconciled to her relations  I owned that this restraint made me sometimes ready to fly out  And Mrs Moore was so good as to declare that she did not much wonder at it  Thou art a very good sort of woman Mrs Moore thought I  As Miss Howe has actually detected our mother and might possibly find some way still to acquaint her friend with her discoveries I thought it proper to  prepossess them in Mrs Sinclair's favour and in that of her two nieces  I said  They were gentlewomen born had not bad hearts that indeed my spouse did not love them they having once jointly taken the liberty to blame her for her overniceness with regard to me People I said even  good  people who knew themselves to be guilty of a fault they had no inclination to mend were too often least patient when told of it as they could less bear than others to be thought indifferently of  Too often the case they owned  Mrs Sinclair's house was a very handsome house and fit to receive the first quality True enough Jack Mrs Sinclair was a woman very easy in her circumstances A widowgentlewomanas  you  Mrs Moore are Lets lodgingsas  you  Mrs Moore do Once had better prospectsas  you  Mrs Moore may have had The relict of Colonel Sinclair You Mrs Moore might know Colonel SinclairHe had lodgings at Hamstead  She had heard of the name  O he was related to the best families in Scotland And his widow is not to be reflected upon because she lets lodgings you know Mrs Moore You know Miss Rawlins  Very true and Very true And they must needs say it did not look quite so pretty in such a lady as my spouse to be so censorious  A foundation here thought I to procure these womens help to get back the fugitive or their connivance at least at my doing so as well as for anticipating any future information from Miss Howe  I gave them a character of that virago And intin  ated  that for a head to contrive mischief and a heart to execute it she had hardly her equal in her sex  To  this  Miss Howe it was Mrs Moore said she supposed that my spouse was so desirous to dispatch a man and horse by daydawn with a letter she wrote before she went to bed last night proposing to stay no longer than till she had received an answer to it  The very same said I I  knew  she would have immediate recourse to her I should have been but too happy could I have prevented such a letter from passing or so to have managed as to have it given into Mrs Howe's hands instead of her daughter's Women who had lived some time in the world knew  better  than to encourage such skittish pranks in young wives  Let me just stop to tell thee while it is in my head that I have since given Will his cue to find out where the man lives who is gone with the fair fugitive's letter and if possible to see him on his return before he sees her  I told the women  That I despaired it would ever be better with us while Miss Howe had so strange a predominance over my spouse and remained herself  unmarried  and until the reconciliation with her friends could be effected or a  still  happier eventas I should think it who am the last male of my family and which my foolish vow and her rigour had hitherto  Here I stopt and looked modest turning my diamond ring round my finger While goody Moore looked mighty significant calling it a very particular case and the maiden lady fann'd away and primm'd and purs'd to shew that what I said needed no farther explanation  I told them the occasion of our present difference Avowed the reality of the fire But owned that I would have made no scruple of breaking the unnatural oath she had bound me in having an husband's right of my side when she was so accidentally frighted into my arms And I blamed myself  excessively that I did not since she thought fit to carry her resentment so high and had the injustice to suppose the fire to be a contrivance of mine  Nay for that matter Mrs Moore saidas we were married and  Madam  was so oddEvery gentleman would notAnd there stopt Mrs Moore  To suppose I should have recourse to such a  poor  contrivance said I when I saw the dear creature  every hour    Was not this a bold put Jack  A most extraordinary case truly the maiden lady Fanning yet coming in with her  Wellbuts  and her sifting  PraySir's  And her restraining  EnoughSir's  flying  from  the question  to  the question her seat nowandthen uneasy for fear my want of delicacy should hurt her abundant modesty and yet it was difficult to satisfy her  super  abundant curiosity  My beloved's jealousy which of itself to female minds accounts for a thousand unaccountablenesses and the imputation of her halfphrensy brought upon her by her father's wicked curse and by the previous persecutions she had undergone from all her family were what I dwelt upon in order to provide against what might happen  In short  I owned against myself most of the offences which I did not doubt but she would charge me with in their hearing And as every cause has a black and a white side I gave the worst parts of our story the gentlest turn And when I had done gave them some  partial  hints of the contents of Captain Tomlinson's letter which I had left with her With a caution to be guarded against the inquiries of James Harlowe and of Captain Singleton or of any sailorlooking men  This thou wilt see from the letter itself was necessary to be done Here therefore thou mayest read it And a charming letter to my purpose if thou givest the least attention to its contents wilt thou find it to be  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq    Dear Sir  Wedn June    ALTHO' I am obliged to be in town tomorrow or next day at farthest yet I would not dispense with writing to you by one of my servants whom I send up before me upon a particular occasion in order to advertise you  that it is probable you will hear from some of your own relations on your supposed  What is between hooks thou mayest suppose Jack I sunk upon the women in the account I gave them of the contents of this letter    nuptials  One of the persons Mr Lilburne by name to whom I hinted my belief of your marriage happens to be acquainted with Mr Spurrier Lady Betty Lawrance's steward and not being under any restriction mentioned it  to  Mr Spurrier and he to Lady Betty as a thing certain And this tho' I have not the honour  to be personally known to her ladyship  brought on an inquiry from her ladyship to me by her gentleman who coming to me in company with Mr Lilburne I had no way but to confirm the report And I understand that Lady Betty takes it amiss that she was not acquainted with so desirable a piece of news from yourself  Her ladyship it seems has  business that calls her to town  and you will possibly choose to put her right If you do it will I presume  be in confidence  that nothing may perspire from your  own  family to contradict what I have given out  I have ever been of opinion  That truth ought to be strictly adhered to on all occasions  And am concerned that I have departed tho' with so good a view from my old maxim But my dear friend Mr John Harlowe would have it so Yet I never knew a departure of this kind a  single  departure But to make the best of it now allow me Sir once more to beg the lady as soon as possible to authenticate the report given out When you both join in the acknowlegement  it will be impertinent in any one to be inquisitive as to the  day or week  And if as privately celebrated as you intend while the gentlewomen with whom you lodge are properly instructed as you say they are and who actually believe you were married long ago who shall be able to give a contradiction to my report  And yet it is very probable that minute inquiries will be made and this is what renders precaution necessary For Mr James Harlowe will not believe that you are married and is sure he says that you both lived together when Mr Hickman's application was made to Mr John Harlowe And if you lived together  any  time unmarried he infers from  your  character Mr Lovelace that it is not probable that you would ever marry And he leaves it to his two uncles to decide if you even  should be  married whether there be not room to believe that his sister was first dishonoured and if so to judge of the title she will have to their favour or to the forgiveness of any of her family I believe Sir this part of my letter had best to be kept from the lady  What makes young Mr Harlowe the more earnest to find this out and find it out he is resolved and to come at his sister's speech too and for that purpose sets out tomorrow as I am wellinformed with a large attendance armed and Mr Solmes is to be of the party is thisMr John Harlowe has told the whole family that he will alter and newsettle his will Mr Antony Harlowe is resolved to do the same by his for it seems he has now given over all thoughts of changing his condition  having lately been disappointed in a view he had of that sort with Mrs Howe  These two brothers generally act in concert and Mr James Harlowe dreads and let me tell you that he has reason for it on  my  Mr Harlowe's account that his younger sister will be at last more benefited than he wishes for by the alteration  intended He has already been endeavouring to sound his uncle Harlowe on this subject and wanted to know whether any new application had been made to him on his sister's part Mr Harlowe avoided a direct answer and expressed his wishes for a general reconciliation and his hopes that his niece was married This offended the furious young man and he reminded his uncle of engagements they had all entered into at his sister's going away  not to be reconciled but by general consent  Mr John Harlowe complains to me often of the uncontroulableness of his nephew and says that now that the young man has not anybody of whose superior sense he stands in awe he observes not decency in his behaviour to any of them And this makes  my  Mr Harlowe still more desirous than ever of bringing his younger niece into favour again I will not say all I might of this young man's extraordinary rapaciousnessBut one would think  that these grasping men expect to live for ever  I took the liberty but within these two hours to propose to set on foot and offer'd my cover to a correspondence between  my friend and his daughterniece  as he still sometimes fondly calls her She was mistress of so much prudence I said that I was sure she could better direct every thing to its desirable end than anybody else could But he said he did not think himself intirely at liberty to take such a step  at present  and that it was best that he should have it in his power to say occasionally that he had not any correspondence  with  her or letter  from  her  You will see Sir from all this the necessity of keeping our treaty an  absolute secret  and if the lady has mentioned it to her  worthy  friend Miss Howe I hope it is in confidence  And now Sir a few lines in answer to yours of Monday last  Mr Harlowe was very well pleased with your readiness to come into his proposal But as to what you  both  desire that he will be present at the ceremony he said that his nephew watched all his steps so narrowly that he thought it was not practicable if he were inclinable to oblige you But that he consented with all his heart that I should be the person privately present at the ceremony on his part  However I think I have an  expedient  for this if your lady  continues  to be very desirous of her uncle's presence except he should be more determined than his answer seemed to import of which I shall acquaint you and perhaps of what he says to it when I have the pleasure to see you in town But indeed I think you have no time to lose Mr Harlowe is impatient to hear that you are actually one and I hope I may carry him down word when I leave you next that I saw the ceremony performed  If any obstacle arises from the lady from  you  it cannot I shall be tempted to think a little hardly of her punctilio  Mr Harlowe hopes Sir that you will rather take pains to  avoid  than to  meet  this violent young man He has the better opinion of you let me tell you Sir from the account I gave him of your moderation and politeness neither of which are qualities with his nephew  But we have all of us something to amend  You cannot imagine how dearly my friend still loves this excellent niece of hisI will give you an instance of it which affected me a good deal  If once more said he the last time but one we were together I can but see this sweet child gracing the upperend of my table as mistress of my house in my  allotted month  all the rest of the family present but as her guests for so I  would  have it and had her  mother's consent for it  There he stopt for he was forced to turn his reverend face from me  Tears ran down his cheeks Fain would he have hid them But he could not  Yetyet said hehow how poor gentleman he perfectly sobbed how shall I be able to bear the first meeting  I bless God I am  no hardhearted man  Mr Lovelace My eyes shewed to my worthy friend that he had no reason to be ashamed of his humanity before me  I will put an end to this long epistle Be pleased to make my compliments acceptable to the most excellent of women as well as believe me to be  Dear Sir  Your faithful friend and humble servant  ANTONY TOMLINSON  During the above conversation I had planted myself at the further end of the apartment we were in overagainst the door which was open and opposite to the lady's chamberdoor which was shut I spoke so low that it was impossible at that distance that she should hear what we said and in this situation I could see if her door opened  I told the women that what I had mentioned of Lady Betty's and her niece's coming to town and of their intention to visit my spouse whom they had never seen nor she them was real and that I expected news of their arrival every hour I then shewed them copies of the other two letters which I had left with her the one from lady Betty the other from my cousin MontagueAnd here thou mayest read them if thou wilt  Eternally reproaching eternally upbraiding me are my impertinent relations But they are fond of occasions to find fault with me Their love their love Jack and their dependence on my known good humour their inducement  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq    Dear Nephew  Wedn Morn June    I Understand that at length all our wishes are answered in your happy marriage But I think we might as well have heard of it directly from you as from the roundabout way by which we have been made acquainted with it Methinks Sir the  power  and the  will  we have to oblige you should not expose us the more to your slights and negligence My brother had set his heart upon giving to you the wife we have all so long wished you to have But if you were actually married at the time you made him that request supposing perhaps that his gout would not let him attend you it is but like  you  I gave the women room to think this reproach  just  Jack  If your lady had  her  reasons to wish it to be private while the differences between her family and self continue you might nevertheless have communicated it to us with  that  restriction and we should have forborn the public manifestations of our joy upon an event we have so long desired  The distant way we have come to know it is by my steward who is acquainted with a friend of Captain Tomlinson to whom that gentleman revealed it And he it seems had it from yourself and lady with such circumstances as leave it not to be doubted  I am indeed very much disobliged with you So is my sister Sadleir But I shall have a very speedy opportunity to tell you so in person being obliged to go to town on my old Chanceryaffair My cousin Leeson who is it seems removed to Albemarlestreet has notice of it I shall be at  her  house where I bespeak your attendance on Sunday night I have written to my cousin Charlotte for either her or her sister to meet me at Reading and accompany me to town I shall stay but a few days my business  being matter of form only On my return I shall pop upon my brother at M Hall to see in what way his last fit has left him  Mean time having told you my mind on your negligence I cannot help congratulating you both upon the occasion Your fair lady particularly upon her entrance into a family which is prepared to admire and love her  My principal intention of writing to you dispensing with the necessary punctilio is that you may acquaint my dear new niece that I will not be denied the honour of her company down with me into Oxfordshire I understand that your proposed house and equipages cannot be soon ready She shall be with me till they are I insist upon it This shall make all up My house shall be her own My servants and equipages hers  Lady Sarah who has not been out of her own house for months will oblige me with her company for a week in honour of a niece so dearly beloved as I am sure she will be of us all  Being but in lodgings in town neither you nor your lady can require much preparation  Some time on Monday I hope to attend the dear young lady to make her my compliments and to receive  her  apology for  your  negligence Which and her going down with me as I said before shall be full satisfaction Mean time God bless  her  for her courage Tell her I say so And bless you  both  in each other and that will be happiness to us all particularly to  Your truly affectionate Aunt  ELIZ LAWRANCE  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq    Dear Cousin  AT last as we understand there is some hope of you Now does my good Lord run over his  beadroll of proverbs of  Black oxen Wild oats Long lanes  and so forth  Now cousin say I is your time come and you will be no longer I hope an infidel either to the power or excellence of the sex you have pretended hitherto so much to undervalue nor a ridiculer or scoffer at an institution which all sober people reverence and all rakes sooner or later are brought to reverence or to wish they had  I want to see how you become your silken fetters Whether the charming yoke fits light upon your shoulders If with such a sweet yokefellow it does not my Lord and my sister as well as I think that you will deserve a closer tie about your neck  His Lordship frets like gum'd taffaty that you have not written him word of the day the hour the manner and every thing But I ask him How he can  already  expect any mark of deference or politeness from you He must stay I tell him till that sign of reformation among others must appear from the influence and example of your lady But that if ever you will be good for any thing it will be quickly seen And Oh cousin what a vast vast journey have you to take from the dreary land of Libertinism thro' the bright province of Reformation into the serene kingdom of HappinessYou had need to lose no time You have many a weary step to tread before you can overtake those travellers who set out for it from a less remote quarter But you have a charming polestar to guide you that's your advantage I wish you joy of it And as I have never yet expected any highly complaisant thing from you I make no scruple to begin first but it is purely I must tell you in respect to my new cousin whose accession into our family we most heartily congratulate and rejoice in  I have a letter from Lady Betty She commands my attendance or my sister's at Reading to proceed  with her to the great beastly town to cousin Leeson's She puts Lord M in hopes that she shall certainly bring down with her our lovely new relation for she says she will not be denied His Lordship is the willinger to let  me  be the person as I am in a manner wild to see her my sister having two years ago had that honour at Sir Robert Biddulph's So get ready to accompany us in our return except your lady has objections strong enough to satisfy us all Lady Sarah longs to see her and says This accession to the family will supply to it the loss of her beloved daughter  I shall soon I hope pay my compliments to the dear lady in person So have nothing to add but that I am  Your old mad Playfellow and Cousin  CHARLOTTE MONTAGUE·  The women having read the copies of these two letters I thought that I might then threaten and swagger  But very little heart have I said I to encourage such a visit from Lady Betty and Miss Montague to my spouse For after all I am tired out with her strange ways She is not what she was and as I told her in your hearing ladies I will leave this plaguy island tho' the place of my birth and tho' the stake I have in it is very considerable and go and reside in France or Italy and never think of myself as a married man  nor live like one  O dear said one  That would be a sad thing said the other  Nay Madam turning to Mrs MooreIndeed Madam to Miss RawlinsI am quite desperate I can no longer bear such usage I have had the good fortune to be favoured by the smiles of very fine ladies tho' I say it and I looked modest both abroad and at homeThou knowest this to be true Jack With regard to my spouse here I had but one hope left  for as to the reconciliation with her friends I scorn them all too much to value that but for her sake and that was that if it pleased God to bless us with children she might intirely recover her usual serenity and we might then be happy But the reconciliation her heart was so much set upon is now as I hinted before intirely hopelessMade so by this rash step of hers and by the rasher temper she is in since as you will believe her brother and sister when they come to know it will make a fine handle of it against us bothaffecting as they do at present to disbelieve our marriageand the dear creature herself too ready to countenance such a disbeliefas nothing  more than the ceremony    Here I was bashful for Miss Rawlins by her preparatory primness put me in mind that it was  proper to be so    I turned half round then facing the fanplayer and the matronYou  yourselves  ladies knew not what to believe till  Now  that I have told you our story And I do assure you that I shall not give myself the same trouble to convince people I hate People from whom I neither expect nor desire any favour and who are determined  not  to be convinced And what pray must be the issue when her uncle's friend comes altho' he seems to be a  truly worthy man  Is it not natural for him to say  To what purpose Mr Lovelace should I endeavour to bring about a reconciliation between Mrs Lovelace and her friends by means of her elder uncle when a good understanding is wanting between yourselves  A fair inference Mrs MooreA fair inference Miss RawlinsAnd here is the unhappinessTill she is reconciled to them this cursed oath in her notion is binding  The women seem'd moved for I spoke with great earnestness tho' lowAnd besides they love to have their sex and its favours appear of importance to us They shook their deep heads at each other  and looked sorrowful And this moved my tender heart too  'Tis an unheardof case ladiesHad she not preferred me to all mankindThere I stoppedAnd that resumed I feeling for my handkerchief is what staggered Captain Tomlinson when he heard of her flight who the last time he saw us together saw the most affectionate couple on earthThe most affectionate couple on earthin the accentgrievous repeated I  Out then I pulled my handkerchief and putting it to my eyes arose and walked to the windowIt makes me weaker than a womanDid I not love her as never man loved  his wife  I have no doubt but I do Jack  There again I stopt and resumingCharming creature as you see she is I wish I had never beheld her faceExcuse me ladies traversing the room And having rubbed my eyes till I supposed them red I turned to the women and pulling out my lettercase I will shew you one letterHere it isRead it Miss Rawlins if you pleaseIt will confirm to you how much all my family are prepared to admire her I am freely treated in itso I am in the two others But after what I have told you nothing need be a secret to you two  She took it with an air of eager curiosity and looked at the seal ostentatiously coronetted and at the superscription reading out  To Robert Lovelace  Esq  Ay MadamAy Missthat's my name giving myself an air tho' I had told it to them before I am not ashamed of it My wife's maiden name  Unmarried  name I should rather sayfool that I amand I rubbed my cheek for vexation Fool enough in conscience Jack was Harlowe Clarissa Harlowe You heard me call her  My Clarissa    I didbut thought it to be a feigned or lovename said Miss Rawlins  I wonder what is Miss Rawlins's lovename Jack Most of the fair Romancers have in their early womanhood chosen Lovenames No parson ever gave more  real  names than I have given  fictitious  ones And to very good purpose Many a sweet dear has answered me a letter for the sake of owning a name which her godmother never gave her  NoIt was her real name I said  I bid her read out the whole letter If the spelling be not exact Miss Rawlins said I you will excuse it the writer is a Lord But perhaps I may not shew it to my spouse for if those I have left with her have no effect upon her neither will this And I shall not care to expose my Lord M to her scorn Indeed I begin to be quite careless of consequences  Miss Rawlins who could not but be pleased with this mark of my confidence looked as if she pitied me  And here thou mayest read the letter No III  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq    Cousin Lovelace  M Hall  Wedn June    I Think you might have found time to let us know of your nuptials being actually solempnized I might have expected this piece of civility from you But perhaps the ceremony was performed at the very time that you asked me to be your lady's fatherBut I shall be angry if I proceed in my guessesAnd  little said is soon amended  But I can tell you that Lady Betty Lawrance whatever Lady Sarah does will not so soon forgive you as I have done  Women resent slights longer than men  You that know so much of the sex I speak it not however to your praise might have known  That  But never was you before acquainted with a lady of such an amiable character I hope there will be but one soul between you I have before now said that I will  disinherit you and settle all I can upon her if you prove not a good husband to her  May this marriage be crowned with a great many fine boys I desire no girls to build up again a family so antient The first boy shall take my surname by act of parliament That is in my will  Lady Betty and niece Charlotte will be in town about business  before you know where you are  They long to pay their compliments to your fair bride I suppose you will hardly be at the Lawn when they get to town because Greme informs me you have sent no orders there for your lady's accommodation  Pritchard has all things in readiness for signing I will take no advantage of your slights Indeed I am too much used to themMore praise to my patience than to your complaisance however  One reason for Lady Betty's going up as I may tell you  under the rose  is to buy some suitable presents for Lady Sarah and all of us to make on this agreeable occasion  We would have blazed it away could we have had timely notice and thought it would have been agreeable to all round The  like occasions don't happen every day  My most affectionate compliments and congratulations to my new niece conclude me for the present in violent pains that with all your heroicalness would make you mad  Your truly affectionate Uncle  M  This letter clench'd the nail Not but that Miss Rawlins said she saw I had been a wild gentleman and truly she thought so the moment she beheld me  They began to intercede for my spouse so nicely had I turn'd the tables and that I would not go abroad and disappoint a reconciliation so much wished  for on one side and such desirable prospects on the other in my own family  Who knows thought I to myself but more may come of this plot than I had even promised myself What a happy man shall I be if these women can be brought to join to carry my marriage into consummation  Ladies you are exceeding good to us both I should have some hopes if my unhappilynice spouse could be brought to dispense with the unnatural oath she has laid me under You see what my case is Do you think I may not insist upon her absolving me from this abominable oath Will you be so good as to give your advice that one apartment may serve for a man and his wife at the hour of retirement Modestly put BelfordAnd let me here observe that few rakes besides me would find a language so decent as to engage modest women to talk with him in upon such subjects  They both simper'd and look'd upon one another  These subjects always make women simper at least No  need  but of the most delicate hints to  them  A man who is gross in a woman's company ought to be knock'd down with a club For like so many musical instruments touch but a single wire and the dear souls are sensible all over  To be sure Miss Rawlins learnedly said playing with her fan a casuist would give it that the matrimonial vow ought to supersede any other obligation  Mrs Moore for her part was of opinion that if the lady owned herself to be a wife she ought to behave  like  one  Whatever be my luck thought I with this  alleyed  fair one any other woman in the world from fifteen to fiveandtwenty would be mine upon my own terms before the morning  And now that I may be at hand to take all advantages  I will endeavour said I to myself to make sure of good quarters  I am your lodger Mrs Moore in virtue of the earnest I have given you for these apartments and for any one you can spare above for my servants Indeed for  all  you have to sparefor who knows what my spouse's brother may attempt I will pay you your own demand and that for a month or two certain board included as I shall or shall not be your hindrance Take  that  as a pledge or in part of paymentOffering her a thirty pound bank note  She declined taking it desiring she might consult the lady first adding that she doubted not my honour and that she would not lett her apartments to any other person whom she knew not something of while I and the lady were here  The lady The lady  from both the womens mouths continually which still implied a doubt in their hearts And not  Your spouse  and  Your lady Sir  I never met with such women thought I So thoroughly convinced but this moment yet already doubting I am afraid I have a couple of Sceptics to deal with  I knew no reason I said for my wife to object to my lodging in the same house with her here any more than in town at Mrs Sinclair's But were she to make such objection I would not quit possession since it was not unlikely that the same freakish disorder which brought her to Hamstead might carry her absolutely out of my knowlege  They both seemed embarrassed and looked upon one another yet with such an air as if they thought there was reason in what I said And I declared myself her boarder as well as lodger and dinnertime approaching was not denied to be the former  LETTER III  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  I Thought it was now high time to turn my whole mind to my beloved who had had full leisure to weigh the contents of the letters I had left with her  I therefore requested Mrs Moore to step in and desire to know whether she would be pleased to admit me to attend her in her apartment on occasion of the letters I had left with her or whether she would favour me with her company in the diningroom  Mrs Moore desired Miss Rawlins to accompany her in to the lady They tapp'd at her door and were both admitted  I cannot but stop here for one minute to remark tho' against myself upon that security which innocence gives that nevertheless had better have in it a greater mixture of the Serpent with the Dove For here heedless of all I could say behind her back because she was satisfied with her own worthiness she permitted me to go on with my own story without interruption to persons as great strangers to her as to me and who as strangers to  both  might be supposed to lean to the side most injured And that as I managed it was to mine A dear silly soul thought I at the time to depend upon the goodness of her own heart when the heart cannot be seen into but by its actions and she to appearance a runaway an eloper from a tender a most indulgent husbandTo neglect to cultivate the opinion of individuals when the whole world is governed by appearance  Yet what can be expected of an angel under twentyShe has a world of knowlege knowlege  speculative  as I may say but no  experience  How should sheKnowlege by theory only is a vague uncertain  light A Will o' the Wisp which as often misleads the doubting mind as puts it right  There are many things in the world could a moralizer say that would afford inexpressible pleasure to a reflecting mind were it not for the mixture they come to us with To be graver stil I have seen parents perhaps my own did so who delighted in those very qualities in their children while young the natural consequences of which too much indulged and encouraged made them as they grew up the plague of their heartsTo bring this home to my present purpose I must tell thee that I adore this charming creature for her vigilant prudence but yet I would not methinks wish her by virtue of that prudence which is however necessary to carry her above the  devices  of all the rest of the world to be too wise for  mine  My revenge my  sworn  revenge is nevertheless adore her as I will uppermost in my heartMiss Howe says that my Love is an  Herodian  Love  Vol  iv  p    By my soul that girl's a witchI am half sorry to say that I find a pleasure in playing the tyrant over what I love Call it an ungenerous pleasure if thou wilt Softer hearts than mine know it The women to a woman know it and  shew  it too whenever they are trusted with power And why should it be thought strange that I who love them so dearly and study them so much should catch the infection of them  LETTER IV  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  I Will now give thee the substance of the dialogue that passed between the two women and the lady  Wonder not that a perv  rse wife makes a listening husband The event however as thou wilt  find justified the old observation  That listeners seldom hear good of themselves  Conscious of their own demerits if I may guess by myself There's ingenuity Jack and fearful of censure they seldom find themselves disappointed There is something of sense after all in these proverbs in these phrases in this  wisdom of nations  Mrs Moore was to be the messenger but Miss Rawlins began the dialogue  Your SPOUSE Madam DevilOnly to fish for a negative or affirmative declaration  Cl  My  spouse  Madam  Miss R  Mr Lovelace Madam averrs that you are married to him and begs admittance or your company in the diningroom to talk upon the subject of the letters he left with you  Cl  He is a poor wicked wretch Let me beg of you Madam to favour me with your company as often as possible while he is hereabouts and I remain here  Miss R  I shall with pleasure attend you Madam But methinks I could wish you would  see  the gentleman and hear what he has to say on the subject of the letters  Cl  My case is a hard a very hard oneI am quite bewilder'dI know not what to doI have not a friend in the world that can or will help meYet had none but friends till I knew  that man  Miss R  The gentleman neither looks nor talks like a bad manNot a  very  bad man as men go  As men goPoor Miss Rawlins thought I And dost thou know  how men go  Cl  O Madam you know him notHe can put on the appearance of an angel of light but has a black a very black heart  Poor I  Miss R  I could not have thought it trulyBut men are very deceitful nowadays  Nowadays  a fool Have not her historybooks told her that they were always so  Mrs Moore  sighing  I have found it so I am sure to my cost  Who knows but in her time poor goody Moore may have met with a Lovelace or a Belford or some such vile fellowMy little hareumscareum Beauty knows not what strange histories every woman living who has had the least independence of will could tell her were such to be as communicative as she is But here's the thing I have given her cause enough of offence but not enough to make her hold her tongue  Cl  As to the letters he has left with me I know not what to say to  them  But am resolved never to have any thing to say to  him  Miss R  If Madam I may be allowed to say so I think you carry matters very far  Cl  Has he been making a bad cause a good one with you Madam  That  he can do with those who know him not Indeed I heard him talking tho' not what he said and am indifferent about it But what account does he give of himself  I was pleased to hear this To arrest to stop her passion thought I in the height of its career is a charming presage  Then the busy Miss Rawlins fish'd on to find out from her either a  confirmation  or  disavowal  of my story Was Lord M my uncleDid I court her at first with the allowance of her friends her brother excepted Had I a rencounter with that brother Was she so persecuted in favour of a very disagreeable man one Solmes as to induce her to throw herself into my protection  None of these were denied All the objections she  could  have made were st  fled or kept in by the consideration as she mentioned that she should stay there but a little while and that her story was too  long But Miss Rawlins would not be thus easily answered  Miss R  He says Madam that he could not prevail for marriage till he had consented under a solemn oath to separate beds while your family remain'd unreconciled  Cl  O the wretchWhat can be still in his head to endeavour to pass these stories upon strangers  So no direct denial thought IAdmirable All will do byandby  Miss R  He has owned that an accidental fire had frighten'd you very much on Wednesday night And thatAnd thatAnd thatan accidental fire had frighten'd youVery much frighten'd youlast Wednesday night  Then after a short pauseIn short He owned That he had taken some innocent liberties which might have led to a breach of the oath you had imposed upon him And that This was the cause of your displeasure  I would have been glad to see how my charmer then look'dTo be sure she was at a loss in her own mind to justify herself for resenting so highly an offence so trifling She hesitatedDid not presently speakWhen she did she wish'd That she Miss Rawlins might never meet with any man who would take such innocent liberties with  her  Miss Rawlins push'd further  Your case to be sure Madam is very particular But if the hope of a reconciliation with your own friends is made more distant by your le  ving him give me leave to say That 'tis pity'tis pityI suppose the maiden then primm'd fann'd and blush'd 'tis pity the oath cannot be dispensed with especially as he owns he has not been so strict a liver  I could have gone in and kiss'd the girl  Cl  You have heard  his  story Mine as I told you before is too long and too melancholy my disorder on seeing the wretch is too great and my time here is too short for me to enter upon it And if he has any end to serve by his own vindication in which I shall not be a  personal  sufferer let him make himself appear as white as an angel with all my heart  My love for her and the excellent character I gave her were then pleaded  Cl  Specious seducerOnly tell me if I cannot get away from him by some backway  How my heart then went  pitapat  Cl  Let me look outI heard the sash lifted up Whither does that path lead to Is there no possibility of getting to a coachSurely he must deal with some fiend or how could he have found me out Cannot I steal to some neighbouring house where I may be concealed till I can get quite away You are good peopleI have not been always among suchO help me help me ladies  with a voice of impatience  or I am ruined  Then pausing Is that the way to Hendon pointing I supposeIs Hendon a private placeThe Hamstead coach I am told will carry passengers thither  Mrs Moore  I have an honest friend at Millhill Devil fetch her thought I where if such be your determination Madam and if you think yourself in danger you may be safe I believe  Cl  Anywhither if I can but escape from  this man  Whither does that path lead to out yonder What is that town on the righthand called  Mrs M  Highgate Madam  Miss R  On the side of the heath is a little village called Northend A kinswoman of mine lives there But her house is small I am not sure she could accommodate such a lady  Devil take her too thought II imagined that  I had made myself a better interest in these women But the whole Sex love plotting and plot  ters  too Jack  Cl  A barn an outhouse a garret will be a palace to me if it will but a afford me a refuge from  this man    Her senses thought I are much livelier than  mine  What a devil have I done that she should be so  very  implacableI told thee Belford All I did Was there any thing in it so  very  much amissSuch prospects of familyreconciliation before her too To be sure she is a very  sensible  lady  She then espied my new servant walking under the window and asked If he were not one of mine  Will was on the lookout for old Grimes So is the fellow called whom my beloved has dispatch'd to Miss Howe And being told that the man she saw  was  my servant I see said she that there is no escaping unless you Madam To Miss Rawlins I suppose can befriend me till I can get farther I have no doubt that that fellow is planted about the house to watch my steps But the wicked wretch his master has no right to controul me He shall not hinder me from going whither I please I will raise the town upon him if he molests me Dear ladies is there no backdoor for me to get out at while you hold him in talk  Miss R  Give me leave to ask you Madam Is there no room to hope for accommodation Had you not better see him He certainly loves you dearly He is a fine gentleman You may exasperate him and make matters more unhappy for yourself  Cl  O Mrs Moore O Miss Rawlins you know not the manI wish not to see his face nor to exchange another word with him as long as I live  Mrs Moore  I don't find Miss Rawlins that the gentleman has misrepresented anything You see Madam  To my Clarissa  how respectful he is not  to come in till permitted He certainly loves you dearly Pray Madam let him talk to you as he wishes to do on the subject of the letters  Very kind of Mrs Moore Mrs Moore thought I is a very good womanI did not curse her then  Miss Rawlins said something but so low that I could not hear what it was Thus it was answer'd  Cl  I am greatly distressed I know not what to doBut Mrs Moore be so good as to give his letters to himHere they areBe pleased to tell him That I wish him and his aunt and cousin a happy meeting He never can want excuses to them for what has happened any more than pretences to those he would delude Tell him That he has ruined me in the opinion of my own friends I am for that reason the less solicitous how I appear to his  Mrs Moore then came to me and being afraid that something would pass mean time between the other two which I should not like I took the letters and entered the room and found them retired into the closet my beloved whispering with an air of earnestness to Miss Rawlins who was all attention  Her back was towards me and Miss Rawlins by pulling her sleeve giving intimation of my being there Can I have no retirement uninvaded Sir said she with indignation as if she was interrupted in some talk her heart was inWhat business have you here or with meYou have your letters han't you  Lovel  I have my dear and let me beg of you to consider what you are about I every moment expect Capt Tomlinson here Upon my soul I do He has promised to keep from your uncle what has happenedBut what will he think if he finds you hold in this strange humour  Cl  I will endeavour Sir to have patience with you for a moment or two while I ask you a few  questions before this lady and Mrs Moore who just then came in both whom you have prejudiced in your favour by your specious storiesWill you say Sir that we are married together Lay your hand upon your heart and answer me Am I your wedded wife  I am gone too far thought I to give up for such a push as thishomeone as it is  My dearest soul how can you put such a questionIs it either for  your  honour or  my own  that it should be doubtedSurely surely Madam you cannot have attended to the contents of Capt Tomlinson's letter  She complained often of want of spirits throughout our whole contention and of weakness of person and mind from the fits she had been thrown into But little reason had  she  for this complaint as I thought who was able to hold me to it as she did I own that I was excessively concern'd for her several times  You and I  Vilest of men    My name is Lovelace Madam  Therefore  it is that I call you the  vilest of men  Was this pardonable Jack  You  and  I  know the truth the  whole  truthI want not to clear up my reputation with these gentlewomenThat is already lost with every one I had most reason to value But let me have this  new  specimen of what you are capable of Say wretch say Lovelace if thou hadst rather Art thou really and truly my wedded hushandSay answer without hesitation  She trembled with impatient indignation but had a wildness in her manner which I took some advantage of in order to parry this cursed thrustAnd a cursed thrust it was since had I positively averr'd it she never would have believed anything I had said And had I owned that I was not married I had destroyed my own plot as well with the women as with her and  could have had no pretence for pursuing her or hindering her from going whithersoever she pleased Not that I was asham'd to averr it had it been consistent with policy I would not have thee think me such a milksop neither  Lovel  My dearest Love how wildly you talk What would you  have  me answer Is it necessary that I  should  answer May I not reappeal this to your own breast as well as to Captain Tomlinson's treaty and letter You know yourself how matters stand between usAnd Captain Tomlinson  Cl  O wretch Is this an answer to my question Say Are we married or are we not  Lovel  What  makes a marriage  we all know If it be the union of two hearts There was a turn Jack to my utmost grief I must say we are  not  since now I see you hate me If it be the completion of marriage to my confusion and regret I must own we are  not  But my dear will you be pleased to consider what answer half a dozen people whence you came could give to your question And do not now in  the disorder of your mind  and in the height of passion bring into question before these gentlewomen a point you have acknowleged before those who know us better  I would have whisper'd her about the treaty with her uncle and the contents of the Captain's letter But retreating and with a rejecting hand Keep thy distance  man  cry'd the dear insolentTo thy own heart I appeal since thou evadest me thus pitifullyI own no marriage with thee Bear witness ladies I do not And cease to torment me cease to follow me Surely surely faulty as I have been I have not deserved to be  thus  persecutedI resume therefore my former language You have no right to pursue me You  know  you have not Begone then and leave me to make the best of my hard lot O my dear cruel papa said she in a violent  fit of grief falling upon her knees and clasping her uplifted hands together thy heavy curse is completed upon thy devoted daughter I am  punished  dreadfully punished  by the very wretch in whom I had placed my wicked confidence  By my soul Belford the little witch with her words but more by her manner moved  me  Wonder not then that her action her grief her tears set the women into the like compassionate manifestations  Had not I a cursed task of it  The two women withdrew to the further end of the room and whisper'd A strange case There is no frenzy hereI just heard said  The charming creature threw her handkerchief over her head and neck continuing kneeling her back towards me and her face hid upon a chair and repeatedly sobb'd with grief and passion  I took this opportunity to step to the women to keep them steady  You see ladies whispering what an unhappy man I am You see what a spirit this dear creature hasAll all owing to her implacable relations and to her father's curseA curse upon them all they have turn'd the head of the most charming woman in the world  Ah Sir Sir replied Miss Rawlins whatever be the fault of her relations all is not as it should be between you and her 'Tis plain she does not think herself married 'Tis  plain  she does not And if you have any value for the poor lady and would not totally deprive her of her senses you had better withdraw and leave to time and cooler consideration the event in your favour  She will compel me to this at last I fear Miss Rawlins I  fear  she will and then we are both undone For I cannot live without her she knows it too wellAnd she has not a friend will look upon  her This also she knows Our marriage when her uncle's friend comes will be proved incontestably But I am ashamed to think I have given her room to believe it no marriage That's what she harps upon  Well 'tis a strange case a very strange one said Miss Rawlins and was going to say further when the angry Beauty coming towards the door said Mrs Moore I beg a word with you And they both stepped into the diningroom  I saw her just before put a parcel into her pocket and followed them out for fear she should slip away and stepping to the stairs that she  might not go by me  Will cry'd I aloud tho' I knew he was not nearPray child to a maid who answered call either of my servants to me  She then came up to me with a wrathful countenance Do you call your servant Sir to hinder me between you from going whither I please  Don't my dearest life misinterpret every thing I do Can you think me so mean and so unworthy as to employ a servant to constrain youI call him to send to the public houses or inns in this town to inquire after Captain Tomlinson who may have alighted at some one of them and be now perhaps needlesly adjusting his dress and I would have him come were he to be without cloaths God forgive me for I am stabb'd to the heart by your cruelty  Answer was returned that neither of my servants was in the way  Not in the way said IWhither can the dogs be gone  O Sir with a scornful air Not far I'll warrant One of them was under the window just now according to order I suppose to watch my stepsBut I will do what I please and go whither I please and that to your face  God forbid that I should hinder you in any thing that you may do with safety to yourself  Now I verily believe that her design was to slip out in pursuance of the closetwhispering between her and Miss Rawlins perhaps to Miss Rawlins's house  She then stept back to Mrs Moore and gave her something which proved to be a diamond ring and desired her not whisperingly but with an air of defiance to me that That might be a pledge for her till she defray'd her demands which she should soon find means to do having no more money about her than she might have occasion for before she came to an acquaintance's  Mrs Moore would have declined taking it but she would not be deny'd and then wiping her eyes she put on her glovesNobody has a right to stop me said sheI  will  goWho should I be afraid ofHer very question charming creature testifying her fear  I beg pardon Madam turning to Mrs Moore and courtesying for the trouble I have given youI beg pardon Madam to Miss Rawlins courtesying likewise to herYou may both hear of me in a happier hour if such a one falls to my lotAnd God bless you bothstruggling with her tears till she sobb'dand away was tripping  I stepped to the door I put it to and setting my back against it took her struggling handMy dearest life My angel said I why will you thus distress me Is this the forgiveness which you so solemnly promised  Unhand me SirYou have no business with me You have no right over me You  know  you have not  But whither whither my dearest love would you goThink you not that I will follow you were it to the world's endWhither would you go  Well do you ask me Whither I would go who  have been the occasion that I have not a friend left But God who knows my innocence and my up  ight intentions will not wholly abandon me when I am out of your powerBut while in it I cannot expect a gleam of the divine grace or favour to reach me  How severe is thisHow shockingly severe Out of  your  presence my angry fair one I can neither hope for the one nor the other As my cousin Montague in the letter you have read observes You are my polestar and my guide and if ever I am to be happy either here or hereafter it must be in and by you  She would then have urged me from the door But respectfully opposing her Begone man Begone Mr Lovelace said sheStop not my wayIf you would not that I should attempt the window give me passage by the door for once more you have no right to detain me  Your resentments my dearest life I will own to be wellgroundedI will acknowlege that I have been all in fault On my knee and down I dropt I ask your pardon And can you refuse to ratify your own  promise  Look forward to the happy prospect before us See you not my Lord M and Lady Sarah longing to bless  you  for blessing me and their whole family Can you take no pleasure in the promised visit of Lady Betty and my cousin Montague And in the protection  they  offer you if you are dissatisfied with  mine  Have you no wish to see your uncle's friendStay only till Captain Tomlinson comesReceive from him the news of your uncle's compliance with the wishes of both  She seem'd altogether distressed was ready to sink and forced to lean against the wainscot as I kneeled at her feet A stream of tears at last burst from her less indignant e  esGood heaven said she lifting up her lovely face and clasped hands what is  at last to be my destinyDeliver me from this dangerous man and direct meI know not what I do what I can do nor what I ought to do  The women as I had owned our marriage to be but half completed heard nothing in this whole scene to contradict not flagrantly to contradict what I had asserted They believed they saw in her returning temper and stagger'd resolution a love for me which her indignation had before suppressed and they joined to persuade her to tarry till the Captain came and to hear his proposals representing the dangers to which she would be exposed the fatigues she might endure a lady of her appearance unguarded unprotected On the other hand they dwelt upon my declared contrition and on my promises For the performance of which they offered to be boundSo much had my kneeling humility affected them  Women Jack tacitly acknowlege the inferiority of their own sex in the pride they take to behold a kneeling lover at their feet  She turned from me and threw herself into a chair  I arose and approached her with reverenceMy dearest creature said Iand was proceedingBut with a face glowing with conscious dignity she interrupted me Ungenerous ungrateful Lovelace You know not the value of the heart you have insulted Nor can you conceive how much my soul despises your meanness But meanness must ever be the portion of the man who can act vilely  The women believing we were likely to be on better terms retired The dear perverse opposed their going but they saw I was desirous of their absence And when they had withdrawn I once more threw myself at her feet and acknowleged my offences implored her forgiveness for this one time and promised the exactest circumspection for the future  It was impossible for her she said to keep her  memory  and  forgive  me What hadst thou  seen  in the conduct of Clarissa Harlowe that should encourage such an insult upon her as thou didst dare to make How meanly must thou think of  her  that  thou  couldst presume to be so guilty and expect  her  to be so weak as to forgive thee  I besought her to let me go over with her Captain Tomlinson's letter I was sure it was impossible she could have given it the requisite attention  I  have  given it the requisite attention said she and the other letters too So that what I say is upon deliberation And what have I to fear from my brother and sisterThey can but  complete  the ruin of my fortunes with my father and uncles Let them and welcome You Sir I thank you have lowered my fortunes But I bless God that my mind is not sunk with my fortunes It is on the contrary raised above Fortune and above You and for half a word they shall have the estate they have envied me for and an acquittal of all expectations from my family that may make them uneasy  I lifted up my hands and eyes in silent admiration of her  My brother Sir may think me ruined To the praise of  your  character by whom I have been seduced from them he may think it it impossible to be with  you  and be innocent You have but too well justified their harshest censures in every part of your conduct But I will now that I have escaped from you and that I am out of the reach of your mysterious devices wrap myself up in my own innocence and then she passionately folded her arms about herself and leave to time and to my future circumspection the reestablishment of my character Leave me then SirPursue me not  Good God interrupting herAnd all this for whatHand I  not  yielded to your intreaties Forgive  me Madam you could not have carried farther your resentments  WretchWas it not crime enough to give  occasion  for those  intreaties  Wouldst thou make a merit to me that thou didst not utterly ruin  her  whom thou oughtest to have protected Begone man turning from me her face crimson'd over with passionSee me no moreI cannot bear thee in my sight  Dearest dearest creature  If I forgive thee LovelaceAnd there she stopp'd To endeavour proceeded she to endeavour to terrify a poor creature by  premeditation  by  low contrivance  by  cries of fire  A poor creature who had consented to take a wretched chance with thee for life  For Heaven's sakeoffering to take her repulsing hand as she was flying from me towards the closet  What hast thou to do to plead the sake of Heaven in thy favour O darkest of human minds  Then turning from me wiping her eyes and again turning towards me but her sweet face halfaside What difficulties hast thou involved me inThou that hadst a plain path before thee after thou hadst betray'd me into thy powerAt once my mind takes in the whole of thy crooked behaviour and if thou thinkest of Clarissa Harlowe as her proud heart tells her thou oughtest to think of her thou wilt seek thy fortunes elsewhere How often hast thou provoked me to tell thee that my soul is above thee  For God's sake Madam for a soul's sake which it is in your power to save from perdition forgive me the past offence I am the greatest villain on earth if it was a premeditated one Yet I presume not to excuse myself On your mercy I throw myself I will not offer at any plea but that of penitence See but Captain Tomlinson See but my aunt and cousin let  them  plead for me let  them  be guaranties for m  honour  If Captain Tomlinson come while I stay here I may see  him  But as for  you  Sir  Dearest creature let me beg of you not to aggravate my offence to the Captain when he comes Let me beg of you  What askest thouIs it not that I shall be of party against myselfThat I shall palliate  Do not charge me Madam interrupted I with villainous premeditationDo not give such a construction to my offence as may weaken your uncle's opinionas may strengthen your brother's  She flung from me to the further end of the room  She could go no further  And just then Mrs Moore came up and told her that dinner was ready and that she had prevailed upon Miss Rawlins to give her her company  You must excuse me Mrs Moore said she Miss Rawlins I hope also willBut I cannot eat I cannot go down As for  you  Sir I suppose you will think it right to depart hence at least till the gentleman comes whom you expect  I respectfully withdrew into the next room that Mrs Moore might acquaint her I durst not myself that I was her lodger and boarder as whisperingly I desired she would And meeting Miss Rawlins in the passage Dearest Miss Rawlins said I stand my friend Join with Mrs Moore to pacify my spouse if she has any new f  ights upon my having taken lodgings and intending to board here I hope she will have more generosity than to think of hindering a gentlewoman from letting her lodgings  I suppose Mrs Moore whom I left with my fair one had apprised her of this before Miss Rawlins went in for I heard her say while I withheld Miss Rawlins  No indeed He is much mistaken Surely he does not think I will  They both expostulated with her as I could gather from bits and scraps of what they said for they  spoke so low that I could not hear any distinct sentence but from the fair perverse whose anger made her louder And to this purpose I heard her deliver herself in answer to different parts of their talk to her  Good Mrs Moore dear Miss Rawlins press me no furtherI cannot sit down at table with him  They said something as I suppose in my behalf  O the insinuating wretchWhat defence have I against a man who go where I will can turn every one even of the virtuous of my sex in his favour  After something else said which I heard not distinctly  This is execrable cunningWere you to know his wicked heart he is not without hope of engaging you two good persons to second him in the vilest of his machinations  How came she thought I at the instant by al  this penetration My devil surely does not play m  booty If I thought he did I would marry and live honest to be even with him  I suppose then they urged the plea which I hinted to Miss Rawlins at going in that she would not be Mrs Moore's hindrance for thus she expressed herself  He will no doubt pay you your own price You need not question his liberality But one house cannot hold us Why if it would did I fly from him to seek refuge among strangers  Then in answer to somewhat else they pleaded  'Tis a mistake Madam I am  not  reconciled to him I will believe nothing he says Has he no  given you a flagrant specimen of what a man he is and of what he is capable by the disguises you saw him in My story is too long and my stay here will be but short or I could convince you tha  my resentments against him are but too wel  founded  I suppose then that they pleaded for  her  leave for  my  dining with them For she said  I have nothing  to say to thatIt is your own house Mrs Moore It is your own table You may admit whom you please to itOnly leave me at my liberty to choose my company  Then in answer as I suppose to their offer of sending her up a plate  A bit of bread if you please and a glass of water That's all I can swallow at present I am really very much discomposed Saw you not how bad I wasIndignation only could have supported my spirits  'I have no objection to his dining with you Madam' added she in reply I suppose to a farther question of the same nature  But I will not stay a night in the house where he lodges if I can help it  I presume Miss Rawlins had told her that she would not stay dinnerfor she said  Let me not deprive Mrs Moore of your company Miss Rawlins You will not be displeased with his talk He can have no design upon you  Then I suppose they pleaded what I might say behind her back to make my own story good  I care not what he says or what he thinks of me Repentance and amendment are all the harm I wish him whatever becomes of me  By her accent she wept when she spoke these last words  They came out both of them wiping their eyes and would have persuaded me to relinquish the lodgings and to depart till her uncle's friend came But I knew better I did not care to trust the devil well as she and Miss Howe suppose me to be acquainted with him for finding her out again if once more she escaped me  What I am most afraid of is that she will throw herself among her own relations and if she does I am confident they will not be able to withstand her affecting eloquence But yet as thou'lt see the Captain's letter to me is admirably calculated to obviate  my apprehensions on this score particularly in that passage where it is said that her uncle thinks not himself at liberty to correspond directly with her or to receive applications from her  But thro' Captain Tomlinson  as is strongly imply'd  See p    of this Volume    I must own notwithstanding the revenge I have so solemnly vowed that I would very fain have made for her a merit with myself  in her returning favour  and owed as little as possible to the mediation of Captain Tomlinson My pride was concerned in this And this was one of my reasons for not bringing him with me Another was That if I were obliged to have recourse to his assistance I should be better able by visiting her without him to direct him what to say or to do as I should find out the turn of her humour  I was however glad at my heart that Mrs Moore came up so seasonably with notice that dinner was ready The fair fugitive was all in Alt She had the game in her own hands and by giving me so good an excuse for withdrawing I had time to strengthen myself the Captain had time to come and the Lady to cool Shakespeare advises well  Oppose not rage while rage is in its force  But give it way awhile and let it waste  The rising deluge is not stopt with dams  Those it o'erbears and drowns the hope of harvest  But wisely manag'd its divided strength  Is sluic'd in channels and securely drain'd  And when its force is spent and unsupply'd  The residue with mounds may be restrain'd  And drysh  d we may pass the naked ford  I went down with the women to dinner Mrs Moore sent her fair boarder up a plate but she only eat a little bit of bread and drank a glass of water  doubted not but she would keep her word when it  was once gone out Is not she an HarloweShe seems to be inuring herself to hardships which at the worst she can never know since tho' she should ultimately refuse to be obliged to me or to express myself more suitably to my own heart to  oblige me  every one who sees her must befriend her  But let me ask thee Belford Art thou not solicitous for me in relation to the contents of the letter which the angry beauty has written and dispatch'd away by man and horse and for what may be Miss Howe's answer to it Art thou not ready to inquire Whether it be not likely that Miss Howe when she knows of her saucy friend's flight will be concern'd about her letter which she must know could not be at Wilson's till after that flight and so probably would fall into my hands  All these things as thou'lt see in the sequel are provided for with as much contrivance as human foresight can admit  I have already told thee that Will is upon the lookout for old GrimesOld Grimes is it seems a gossiping sottish rascal and if Will can but light of him I'll answer for the consequence For has not Will been my servant upwards of seven years  LETTER V  Mr  LOVELACE  In Continuation  WE had at dinner besides Miss Rawlins a young widowniece of Mrs Moore who is come to stay a month with her aunt  Bevis  her name very forward very lively and a great admirer of  me  I assure you hanging smirkingly upon all I said and prepared to approve of every word before I spoke And who by the time we had halfdined by the help of what she had collected before was as  much acquainted with our story as either of the other two  As it behoved me to prepare them in my favour against whatever might come from Miss Howe I improved upon the hint I had thrown out abovestairs against that mischiefmaking Lady I represented her to be an arrogant creature revengeful artful enterprising and one who had she been a man would have sworn and curs'd and committed rapes and play'd the devil as far as I knew and I have no doubt of it Jack but who nevertheless by advantage of a female education and pride and insolence I believed was  personally  virtuous  Mrs Bevis allowed that there was a  vast deal  in educationand in  pride  too she said While Miss Rawlins came with a prudish God forbid that virtue should be owing to education only However I declared that Miss Howe was a subtle contriver of mischief one who had always been  my  enemy her motives I knew not but despising the man whom her mother was desirous she should have one Hickman altho' I did not directly averr that she would rather have had me yet they all immediately imagined that  that  was the ground of her animosity to me and of her envy to my beloved and it was pity they said that so fine a young Lady did not see thro' such a pretended friend  And yet nobody added I has more reason than she to know by  experience  the force of a hatred founded in envy as I hinted to  you  above Mrs Moore and to  you  Miss Rawlins in the case of her sister Arabella  I had compliments made to my person and talents on this occasion which gave me a singular opportunity of displaying my modesty by disclaiming the merit of them with a  No indeedI should be very vain Ladies if I thought so  While thus abasing  myself and exalting Miss Howe I got their opinion both for modesty and generosity and had all the graces which I disclaimed thrown in upon me besides  In short they even oppressed that modesty which to speak modestly of myself their praises  created  by disbelieving all I said against myself  And truly I must needs say they have almost persuaded even me myself that Miss Howe is actually in love with me I have often been willing to hope this And who knows but she may The Captain and I have agreed that it shall be so insinuated  occasionally  And what's thy opinion Jack She certainly hates Hickman And girls who are  disengaged  seldom  hate  tho' they may not  love  And if she had rather have  another  why not that  other  ME For am I not a smart fellow and a rake And do not your sprightly Ladies love your smart fellows and your rakes And where is the wonder that the man who could engage the affections of Miss Harlowe should engage those of a Lady with her  See vol iv p where Miss Howe says  Alas my dear I knew you loved him  Alas's  who would be honoured in being deemed her second  Nor accuse thou me of SINGULAR vanity in this presumption Belford Wert thou to know the secret vanity that lurks in the hearts of those who  disguise  or  cloak it best  thou wouldst find great reason to acquit at least to allow for  me  since it is generally the  conscious overfulness of conceit  that makes the hypocrite most upon his guard to conceal it Yet with these fellows proudlyhumble as they are it will break out sometimes in spite of thier cloaks tho' but in selfdenying complimentbegging selfdegradation  But now I have appealed this matter to thee let  me use another argument in favour of my observation that the Ladies generally prefer a rake to a sober man and of my presumption upon it that Miss Howe is in love with me It is thisCommon fame says That Hickman is a very virtuous a very innocent fellowa  malevirgin  I warrantAn odd dog I always thought himNow women Jack like not novices They are pleased with a Love of the Sex that is founded in the knowlege of it Reason good Novices expect more than they can possibly find in the commerce with them The man who knows them yet has  ardors  for them to borrow a word from Miss Howe  Vol iv p and  tho' those ardors are generally owing more to the devil  within  him than to the witch  without  him is the man who makes them the highest and most grateful compliment He knows what to expect and with what to be satisfied  Then the merit of a woman in some cases must be  ignorance  whether  real  or  pretended  The Man in  these  cases must be an  adept  Will it then be wondered at that a woman prefers a libertine to a noviceWhile she expects in the one the confidence  she  wants she considers the other and herself as two parallel lines which tho' they run side by side can never meet  Yet in this the Sex is generally mistaken too for these sheepish fellows are flyI myself was modest once and this as I have elsewhere hinted to thee  Vol iii p  has better enabled me to judge of bothBut to proceed with my narrative  Having thus prepared everyone against any letter should come from Miss Howe and against my beloved's messenger returns I thought it proper to conclude that subject with a hint that my spouse could not bear to have anything said  that reflected upon  Miss Howe  and with a deep sigh added that I had been made very unhappy more than once by the illwill of Ladies whom I had never offended  The widow Bevis believed that might very easily be  These hints withindoors joined with others to Will both without and within for I intend he shall fall in love with widow Moore's maid and have saved one hundred pounds in my service at least will be great helps as things may happen  LETTER VI  Mr  LOVELACE  In Continuation  WE had hardly dined when my coachman who kept a lookout for Captain Tomlinson as Will did for old Grimes conducted hither that worthy gentleman attended by one servant  both  on horseback He alighted I went out to meet him at the door  Thou knowest his solemn appearance and unblushing freedom and yet canst not imagine what a dignity the rascal assumed nor how respectful to him I was  I led him into the parlour and presented him to the women and them to himI thought it highly imported me as they might still have some diffidences about our marriage from my fairone's home push'd questions on that head to convince them intirely of the truth of all I had asserted And how could I do this better than by dialoguing with him before them a little  Dear Captain I thought you long for I have had a terrible conflict with my spouse  Capt  I am sorry that I am later than my intentionMy account with my bankerThere's a dog  Jack took me up longer time to adjust than I had foreseen  all the time pulling down and stroking his ruffles  for there was a small difference between us only twenty pounds indeed which I had taken no account of The rascal has not seen twenty pounds of his own these ten years  Then had we between us the characters of the Harlowe family I railing against them all the Captain taking his dear friend Mr John Harlowe's part with a  Not so fastNot so fast young gentleman  and the like free assumptions  He accounted for  their  animosity by  my  defiances No good family having such a charming daughter would care to be  defied  instead of  courted  He  must  speak his mind Never was a doubletongu'd man He appealed to the Ladies if he were not right  He got them of his side  The correction I had given the brother he told me must have aggravated matters  How valiant this made me look to the women The Sex love us mettled fellows at their hearts  Be that as it would I should never love any of the family but my spouse and wanting nothing from them would not but for  her  sake have gone so far as I  had  gone towards a reconciliation  This was very good of me Mrs Moore said  Very good indeed Miss Rawlins  GoodIt is  more  than good it is very generous said the widow  Capt  Why so it is I must needs say For I am sensible that Mr Lovelace has been rudely treated by them allMore rudely than it could have been imagined a man of his  quality  and  spirit  would have put up with But then Sir  turning to me  I think you are amply rewarded in such a Lady and that you ought to forgive the father for the daughter's sake  Mrs M  Indeed so I think  Miss R  So must everyone think who has seen the Lady  Widow B  A fine Lady to be sure But she has a violent spirit and some very odd humours too by what I have heard The value of good husbands is not known till they are lost  Her conscience then drew a sigh from her  Lovel  Nobody must reflect upon my angelAn angel she isSome little blemishes indeed as to her overhasty spirit and as to her unforgiving temper But this she has from the Harlowes instigated too by  that  Miss HoweBut her innumerable excellencies are all her own  Capt  Ay talk of spirit There's a spirit now you have named Miss Howe And so I led him to confirm all I had said of that vixen Yet she was to be pitied too looking with meaning at me  As I have already hinted I had before agreed with him to impute secret love  occasionally  to Miss Howe as the best means to invalidate all that might come from her in my disfavour  Capt  Mr Lovelace but that I know your modesty or  you  could give a reason  Lovel  looking down and very modestI can't think so CaptainBut let us call another cause  Every woman present could look me in the face so bashful was I  Capt  Well but as to our  present  situationOnly it mayn't be proper looking upon me and round upon the women  Lovel  O Captain you may say anything before this companyOnly Andrew to my new servant who attended us at table do you withdraw This good girl  looking at the maidservant  will help us to all we want  Away went Andrew He wanted not his cue and  the maid seemed highly pleased at my honour's preference of her  Capt  As to our  present  situation I say Mr LovelaceWhy Sir we shall be all  untwisted  let me tell you if my friend Mr John Harlowe were to know what  that  is He would as much question the truth of your being married as the rest of the family do  Here the women perked up their ears and were all silent attention  Capt  I asked you before  for particulars Mr Lovelace but you  declined giving them  Indeed it may not be  proper  for me to be acquainted with them But I must own that it is past my comprehension that a wife can resent anything a husband can do that is not a breach of the peace so far as to think herself justified for  eloping  from him  Lovel  Captain TomlinsonSirI do assure you that I shall be offendedI shall be extremely concernedif I hear that word mention'd again  Capt  Your nicety and your love Sir may make you take offenceBut it is my way to call everything by its proper name let who will be offended  Thou canst not imagine Belford how brave and how independent the rascal look'd  Capt  When  young Gentleman  you shall think proper to give us particulars we will find a word that shall please you better for this rash act in so admirable a LadyYou see Sir that being the representative of my dear friend Mr John Harlowe I speak as freely as I suppose  he  would do if present But you blush SirI beg your pardon Mr Lovelace It becomes not a modest man to pry into those secrets which a modest man cannot reveal  I did not blush Jack but denied not the compliment and looked down the women seem'd delighted with my modesty but the widow Bevis was  more inclined to laugh at me than praise me for it  Capt  Whatever be the cause of this step I will not again Sir call it  elopement  since that harsh word wounds your tenderness I cannot but express my surprize upon it when I recollect the affectionate behaviour which I was witness to between you when I attended you last  Overlove  Sir I think you once mentionedbut  Overlove  smiling  give me leave to say Sir is an odd cause of quarrel Few Ladies  Lovel  Dear Captain And I tried to blush  The women also tried and being more used to it succeeded betterMrs Bevis indeed has a redhot countenance and always blushes  Miss R  It signifies nothing to mince the matter but the Lady above as good as denies her marriage You  know  Sir that she does turning to me  Capt  Denies her marriage Heavens how then have I imposed upon my dear friend Mr John Harlowe  Lovel  Poor dearBut let not her  veracity  be called in question She would not be guilty of a wilful untruth for the world  Then I had all their praises again  Lovel  Dear creatureshe thinks she has reason for her denial You know Mrs Moore you know Miss Rawlins what I owned to you above as to my vow  I look'd down and as once before turned round my diamond ring  Mrs Moore looked awry and with a leer at Miss Rawlins as to her partner in the hintedat reference  Miss Rawlins look'd down as well as I her eyelids halfclosed as if mumbling a Paternoster meditating  her snuffbox the distance between her nose and chin lengthened by a closeshut mouth  She put me in mind of the pious Mrs Fetherstone at Oxford whom I pointed out to thee once among other grotesque figures at St Mary's church where we went to take a view of her two sisters Her eyes shut not daring to trust her heart with them open and but just halfrearing the lids to see who the nextcomer was and falling them again when her curiosity was satisfied  The widow Bevis gazed as if on the hunt for a secret  The Captain looked archly as if half in possession of one  Mrs Moore at last broke the bashful silence Mrs Lovelace's behaviour she said could be no otherwise so well accountedfor as by the illoffices of  that  Miss Howe and by the severity of her relations which might but too probably have affected her head a little at times Adding that it was very generous in me to give way to the storm when it was up rather than to exasperate at such a time  But let me tell you Sirs said the widow Bevis that is not what one husband in a thousand would have done  I desired that  no part of this conversation might be hinted to my spouse  and looked still more bashfully Her great fault I must own was overdelicacy  The Captain leered round him and said He believed he could guess from the hints I had given him in town of my  overlove  and from what had now passed that we had not consummated our marriage  O Jack how sheepishly then looked or endeavoured to look thy friend how primly Goody Moore how affectedly Miss Rawlinswhile the honest widow Bevis gazed around her fearless and  tho' only simpering with her mouth her eyes laugh'd outright and seem'd to challenge a laugh from every eye in the company  He observ'd that I was a phoenix of a man if so and he could not but hope that all matters would be happily accommodated in a day or two and that then he should have the pleasure to averr to her uncle that he was present as he might say on our weddingday  The women seem'd all to join in the same hope  Ah Captain ah Ladieshow happy should I be if I could bring my dear spouse to be of the same mind  It would be a very happy conclusion of a very knotty affair said widow Bevis and I see not why we may not make this very night a merry one  The Captain superciliously smiled at me He saw plainly enough he said that we had been at  childrens play  hitherto A man of my character must have a prodigious value for his Lady who could give way to such a caprice as This But one thing he would venture to tell me and that was ThisThat however desirous young skittish Ladies might be to have their way in this particular it was a very bad settingout for the man as it gave his bride a very high proof of the power she had over him And he would engage that no woman  thus  humoured ever valued the man the more for it but very much the contraryAnd there were  reasons to be given why she should not  Well well Captain no more of this subject before the Ladies  One  feels in a bashful  trytoblush  manner shrugging my shoulders that  one  is  so  ridiculousI have been punish'd enough for my tender folly  Miss Rawlins had taken her fan and would needs  hide her face behind it I suppose because her blush was not quite ready  Mrs Moore hemm'd and look'd down and by that gave hers over  While the jolly widow laughing out praised the Captain as one of Hudibras's metaphysicians repeating  He knew what's what and that's as high  As metaphysic wit can fly  This made Miss Rawlins blush indeedFie fie Mrs Bevis cry'd she unwilling I suppose to be thought absolutely ignorant  Upon the whole I began to think that I had not made a bad exchange of our professing mother for the unprofessing Mrs Moore And indeed the women and I and my Beloved too all mean the same thing We only differ about the manner of coming at the proposed end  LETTER VII  Mr  LOVELACE  In Continuation  IT was now high time to acquaint my spouse that Captain Tomlinson was come And the rather as the maid told us that the lady had asked her If such a gentleman describing him was not in the parlour  Mrs Moore went up and requested in my name that she would give us audience  But she return'd with a desire that Captain Tomlinson would excuse her for the present She was very ill Her spirits were too weak to enter into conversation with him and she must lie down  I was vexed and at first extremely disconcerted  The Captain was vexed too And my concern thou mayst believe was the greater on his account  She had been very much fatigued I own Her fits in the morning must have weaken'd her And she had carried her resentment so high that it was the less wonder she should find herself low when her raised spirits had subsided  Very  low I may say if sinkings are proportioned to risings for she had been lifted up above the standard of a common mortal  The Captain however sent up in his own name that if he could be admitted to drink one dish of tea with her he should take it for a favour and would go to town and dispatch some necessary business if possible to leave his morning free to attend her  But she pleaded a violent headach and Mrs Moore confirm'd the plea to be just  I would have had the Captain lodge there that night as well in compliment to him as introductory to my intention of entering my self upon my newtaken apartment But his hours were of too much importance to him to stay the evening  It was indeed very inconvenient for him he said to return in the morning but he was willing to do all in his power to heal this breach and that as well for the sakes of me and my lady as for that of his dear friend Mr John Harlowe who must not know how far this misunderstanding had gone He would therefore only drink one dish of tea with the ladies and me  And accordingly after he had done so and I had had a little private conversation with him he hurried away  His fellow had given him in the interim a high character to Mrs Moore's servants And this reported by the Widow Bevis who being no proud woman is  hail fellow well met  as the saying is with all her aunt's servants he was a  fine  gentleman a  discreet  gentleman a man of  sense  and  breeding  with  them all And it was pity that with such great business upon his hands he should be obliged to come again  My life for yours audibly whisper'd the Widow Bevis There is  humour  as well as  headach  in Somebody's declining to see this worthy gentlemanAh Lord how happy might some people be if they would  No perfect happiness in this world said I very gravely and with a sigh for the widow must know that I heard her If we have not  real  unhappiness we can make it even from the overflowings of our own good fortune  Very true and Very true the two widows A charming observation Mrs Bevis Miss Rawlins smil'd  her  assent to it and I thought she call'd me in her heart Charming man For she professes to be a great admirer of moral observations  I had hardly taken leave of the Captain and sat down again with the women when Will came and calling me out 'Sir Sir' said he grinning with a familiarity in his looks as if what he had to say intitled him to take liberties  I have got the fellow downI have got old GrimesHah hah hah hahHe is at the LowerFlaskAlmost in the condition of  David's sow  and please your Honour The dog himself not much better Here is his letterfromfrom Miss HoweHa ha ha ha  laugh'd the varlet holding it fast as if to make conditions with me and to excite my praises as well as my impatience  I could have knock'd him down but he would have his  say  out  Old Grimes knows not that I have the letterI must get back to him before he misses itI only made a pretence to go out for a few minutesButbut  and then the dog laugh'd  again  He  must  stayOld Grimes  must  staytill I go back to pay the reckoning  Dn the praterGrinning rascalThe letter The letter  He gather'd in his  wide mothe  as he calls it and gave me the letter but with a  strut  rather than a  bow  and then sidled off like one of Widow Sorlings's dunghill cocks exulting after a great feat performed And all the time that I was holding up the billet to the light to try to get at its contents without breaking the seal for dispatch'd in a hurry it had no cover there stood he laughing shrugging playing off his legs now stroking his shining chin now turning his hat upon his thumb then leering in my face flourishing with his headO Christ nowandthen cry'd the rascal  What joy has this dog in mischiefMore than I can have in the completion of my most favourite purposesThese fellows are ever happier than their masters  I was once thinking to rumple up this billet till I had broken the seal  Young  families Miss Howe's is not an antient one love ostentatious sealings And it might have been supposed to have been squeez'd in pieces in old Grimes's breeches pocket But I was glad to be  saved  the guilt as well as suspicion of having a hand in so dirty a trick for thus much of the contents enough for my purpose I was enabled to scratch out in character without it the folds depriving me only of a few connecting words which I have supply'd between hooks  My Miss Harlowe thou knowest had  before  changed her name to  Miss  Laetitia Beaumont Another  alias  now Jack I have learn'd her to be half a rogue in this instance for this billet was directed to her by the name of  Mrs  Harriot Lucas  I Congratulate you my dear with all my heart and soul upon your escape from the villain I long for the particulars of all My mamma is out But expecting her return every minute I dispatch'd your messenger instantly I will endeavour to come at Mrs Townsend without loss of time and will write at large in a day or two if in that time I can see her Mean time I am excessively uneasy for a letter I sent you yesterday by Collins who must have left it at Wilson's after you got away It is of very great importance I hope the villain has it not I would not for the world that he should Immediately send for it if by so doing the place you are at will not be discover'd If he has it let me know it by some way out of hand If not you need not send  Ever ever yours  A H  June    O Jack what heart'sease does this  interception  give meI sent the rascal back with the letter to old Grimes and charg'd him to drink no deeper He own'd that he was  half seas over  as he phrased it  Dog said I are you not to court one of Mrs Moore's maids to night  Cry your mercy SirI will be soberI had forgot thatBut old Grimes is plaguy toughI thought I should never have got him down  Away villainLet old Grimes come and on horseback too to the door  He shall and please your Honour if I can get him on the saddle and if he can sit  And charge him not to have alighted nor to have seen  any  body  Enough Sir familiarly nodding his head to shew he took me And away went the villain Into the parlour among the women I  In a quarter of an hour came old Grimes on horseback waving to his saddlebow now on this side now on that his head at others joining to that of his more sober beast  It look'd very well to the women that I made no effort to speak to old Grimes tho' I wish'd  before them  that I knew the contents of what he brought but on the contrary desired that they would instantly let my spouse know that her messenger was return'd Down she flew violently as she had the headach  O how I pray'd for an opportunity to be reveng'd of her for the ingrateful trouble she had given to her uncle's friend  She took the letter from old Grimes with her own hands and retired to an inner parlour to read it  She presently came out again to the fellow who had much ado to sit his horseHere is your money friend I thought you long But what shall I do to get somebody to go to town immediately for me I see  you  cannot  Old Grimes took his money let fall his hat in d'offing it had it given him and rode away his eyes isingglass and set in his head as I saw thro' the window and in a manner speechless all his language hiccoughs My dog need not have gone so deep with this  tough  old GrimesBut the rascal was in his kingdom with him  The lady apply'd to Mrs Moore She matter'd not the price Could a man and horse be engaged for herOnly to go for a letter left for her at one Mr Wilson's in Pallmall  A poor neighbour was hired A horse procured for him He had his directions  In vain did I endeavour to engage my Beloved when she was below Her headach I suppose return'd She like the rest of her sex can be ill or well when she pleases  I see her drift thought I It is to have all her lights from Miss Howe before she resolves and to take her measures accordingly  Up she went expressing great impatience about the letter she had sent for and desired Mrs Moore to let her know if I offer'd to send any of my servants to townTo get at the letter I suppose was her fear But she might have been quite easy on that head and yet perhaps would not had she known that the worthy Captain Tomlinson who will be in town before her messenger will leave there the important letter Which I hope will help to pacify her and to reconcile her to me  O Jack Jack thinkest thou that I will take all this roguish pains and be so often called villain for nothing  But yet is it not taking pains to come at the finest creature in the world not for a  transitory moment  only but for one of our livesThe struggle Whether I am to have her in  my own way  or in  hers  But now I know thou wilt be frighten'd out of thy wits for meWhat Lovelace wouldst thou let her have a letter that will inevitably blow thee up and blow up the mother and all her nymphsyet not intend to reform to marry  Patience puppy Canst thou not trust thy master  LETTER VIII  Mr  LOVELACE  In Continuation  I Went up to my newtaken apartment and fell to writing in character as usual I thought I had made good my quarters But the cruel creature understanding  that I intended to take up my lodgings there declared with so much violence against it that I was obliged to submit and to accept of another lodging about twelve doors off which Mrs Moore recommended And all the advantage I could obtain was that Will unknown to my spouse and for fear of a freak should lie in the house  Mrs Moore indeed was unwilling to disoblige  either  of us But Miss Rawlins was of opinion that nothing more ought to be allow'd me And yet Mrs Moore owned that the refusal was a strange piece of tyranny to an husband if I  were  an husband  I had a good mind to make Miss Rawlins smart for it Come and see Miss Rawlins JackIf thou likest her I'll get her for thee with a  wet finger  as the saying is  The Widow Bevis indeed stickled hard for me An innocent or injur'd man will have friends everywhere She said That to  bear much  with some wives was to be obliged to bear more And I reflected with a sigh  that tame spirits must always be imposed upon  And then in my heart I renew'd my vows of revenge upon this haughty and perverse beauty  The second fellow came back from town about nine o'clock with Miss Howe's letter of Wednesday last  Collins  it seems  when he left it had desired that it might be safely and speedily delivered into Miss Laetitia Beaumont's own hands But Wilson understanding that neither she nor I were in town  He could not know of our difference thou must think  resolved to take care of it till our return in order to give it into one of our own hands and now deliver'd it to her messenger  This was told  her  Wilson I doubt not is in her favour upon it  She took the letter with great eagerness open'd it in a hurry I am glad she did Yet I believe all was right before Mrs Moore and Mrs Bevis Miss Rawlins was gone home and said She would not for the world that I should have had that letter for the sake of her dear friend the writer who had written to her very uneasily about it  Her  dear friend  repeated Mrs Bevis when she told me this Such mischiefmakers are always deem'd  dear friends  till they are found out  The widow says that I am the finest gentleman she ever beheld  I have found a warm kiss nowandthen very kindly taken  I might be a very wicked fellow Jack if I were to do all the mischief in my power But I am evermore for quitting a tooeasy prey to  reptilerakes  What but difficulty tho' the lady is an angel engages me to so much perseverance here And  here Conquer or die  is now the determination  I HAVE just now parted with this honest widow She called upon me at my new lodgings I told her that I saw I must be further oblig'd to her in the course of this difficult affair She must allow me to make her a handsome present when all was happily over But I desired that she would take no notice of what should pass between us  not even to her aunt  for that she as I saw was in the power of Miss Rawlins Who being a maiden gentlewoman knew not the  right  and the  fit  in matrimonial matters as she my dear widow did  Very true How  should  she said Mrs Bevis proud of knowingnothing But for her part she desired no present It was enough if she could contribute to reconcile man and wife and disappoint mischiefmakers She doubted not that such an envious  creature as Miss Howe was glad that Mrs Lovelace had eloped Jealousy and Love  was  old Nick  See Belford how charmingly things work between me and my new acquaintance the widow Who knows but that she may after a little farther intimacy tho' I am banished the house on nights contrive a midnight visit for me to my spouse when all is still and fast asleep  Where can a woman be safe who has once enter'd the lists with a contriving and intrepid lover  But as to this  letter  methinks thou sayest of Miss Howe  I knew thou wouldest be uneasy for me But did not I tell thee that I had provided for every thing That I always took care to keep seals intire and to preserve covers  Vol  iv  p    Was it not easy then thinkest thou to contrive a shorter letter out of a longer and to copy the very words  I can tell thee it was so well ordered that not being suspected to have been in my hands it was not easy to find me out Had it been my Beloved's hand there would have been no imitating it for such a length Her delicate and even mind is seen in the very cut of her letters Miss Howe's hand is no bad one but is not so equal and regular That little devil's natural impatience hurrying on her fingers gave I suppose from the beginning her handwriting as well as the rest of her its fits and starts and those peculiarities which like strong muscular lines in a face neither the pen nor the pencil can miss  Hast thou a mind to see what it was I  permitted  Miss Howe to write to her lovely friend Why then read it here as if by way of marginal observation  as extracted from hers of Wednesday last  Vol  iv  p    with a few additions of my ownThe additions underscored  Mr Lovelace's additions and connexions in this letter are printed in the Italic character    My dearest Friend  YOU will perhaps think that I have been too long silent But I had begun two letters at different times since my last and written a great deal each time and with spirit enough I assure you incensed as I was against the abominable wretch you are with particularly on reading yours of the st of the past month  The FIRST I intended to keep open till I could give you some accounts of my proceedings with Mrs Townsend It was some days before I saw her And this intervenient space giving me time to reperuse what I had written I thought it proper to lay that aside and to write in a style a little less fervent for you would have blamed me I knew for the freedom of some of my expressions execrations if you please And when I had gone a good way in the SECOND the change in your prospects on his communicating to you Miss Montague's letter and his better behaviour occasioning a change in your mind I laid that aside also And in this uncertainty thought I would wait to see the issue of affairs between you before I wrote again believing that all would soon be decided one way or other  Here I was forced to break off  I am  too little  my own mistress My mother  Vol iv p  always up and down and watching as if I were writing to a fellow What need I she asks me lock myself in  p  if I am only reading past correspondencies For that is my pretence when she comes poking in with her face sharpen'd to an edge as I may say by a curiosity that gives her more pain than pleasureThe Lord forgive me but I believe I shall huff her next time she comes in  Do you forgive me too my dear My mother ought because she says I am my father's girl and because I am sure I am hers  Upon my life my dear I am sometimes of opinion that this vile man was capable of meaning you dishonour When I look back upon his past conduct I cannot help thinking so What a villain if so But now I hope and verily believe that he has laid aside such thoughts My reasons for both opinions I will give you  For the first to wit that he had it once in his head to take you at advantage if he could I consider  p    that  pride revenge and a delight to tread in unbeaten paths are principal ingredients in the character of this finish'd libertine He hates all your family yourself exceptedYet is a savage in love His pride and the credit which a few plausible qualities sprinkled among his odious ones have given him have secured him too good a reception from our eyejudging our undistinguishing our selfflattering our tooconfiding sex to make assiduity and obsequiousness and a conquest of his unruly passions any part of his study  He has some reason for his animosity to all the men and to one woman of your family He has always shewn you and his own family too that he prefers his pride to his interest He is a declared marriagehater a notorious intriguer full of his inventions and glorying in them As his vanity had made him imagine that no woman could be proof against his love no wonder that he struggled like a lion held in toils  Vol iv p  against a passion that he thought not returned  ibid  Hence perhaps it is not difficult to believe that it became possible for such a wretch as this to give way to his old prejudices against marriage and to that revenge which had always been a first passion with him  p    And hence may we account for  his delays his teazing ways his bringing you to bear with his lodging in the same house his making you pass to the people of it as his wife his bringing you into the company of his libertine companions the attempt of imposing upon you that Miss Partington for a bedfellow  c  My reasons for the contrary opinion to wit that he is now resolved to do you all the justice in his power to do you  are these That he sees that all his own family  p  have warmly engaged themselves in your cause that the horrid wretch loves youWith such a Love  however  as H  d loved his Mariamne That on inquiry I find it to be true that counsellor Williams whom Mr Hickman knows to be a man of eminence in his profession has actually as good as finished the settlements That two draughts of them have been made one avowedly to be sent to  this very  Captain Tomlinson And I find that a licence has actually been more than once endeavoured to be obtained and that d  fficulties have hitherto been made equally to Lovelace's vexation and disappointment My mother's proctor who is very intimate with the proctor apply'd to by the wretch has come at this information in confidence and hints that as Mr Lovelace is a man of high fortunes these difficulties will probably be got over  I had once resolved to make strict inquiry about Tomlinson and still if you will your uncle's favourite housekeeper may be sounded at distance  I know that the matter is so laid  p  that Mrs Hodges is supposed to kn  w nothing of the treaty set on foot by means of Capt Tomlinson But your uncle is an old man  p  and old men imagine themselves to be under obligation to their paramours if younger than themselves and seldom keep any thing from their knowlegeYet methinks there can be no need since Tomlinson as you describe him is so good a man and so much of a gentleman the end to be answered by his being an impostor so much more than necessary if Lovelace has villainy in his headAnd thus what he communicated to you of Mr Hickman's application to your uncle and of Mrs Norton's to your mother some of which particulars I am satisfied his vile agent Joseph Leman could not reveal to his viler employer his pushing on the marriageday in the name of your uncle which it could not answer any wicked purpose for him to do and what he writes of your uncle's proposal to have it thought that you were married from the time that you had lived in one house together and that to be made to agree with the time of Mr Hickman's visit to your uncle the insisting on a trusty person's being present at the ceremony at that uncle's nominationThese things make me  assured that he now at last means honourably  But if any unexpected delays should happen on his side acquaint me my dear of the very street where Mrs Sinclair lives and where Mrs Fretchville's house is situated which I cannot find that you have ever mentioned in your former letterswhich is a little odd and I will make strict inquiries of them and of Tomlinson too and I will if your heart will let you take my advice soon procure you a refuge from him with Mrs Townsend  But why do I now when you seem to be in so good a train puzzle and perplex you with my retrospections And yet they may be of use to you if any delay happen on his part  But that I think cannot well be What you have therefore now to do is so to behave to this proudspirited wretch as may banish from his mind all remembrance of  past disobligations  Vol iv p  and to receive his addresses as those of a betrothed lover You will incur the censure of prudery and affectation if you keep him at that distance which you have hitherto  kept him at  His sudden and as suddenly recover'd illness has given him an opportunity to find out that you love him Alas my dear I knew you loved him He has seemed to change his nature and is all love and gentleness  And no more quarrels now I beseech you  I am very angry with him nevertheless for the freedoms which he took with your person  See p    and I think some guard is necessary as he is certainly an incroacher But indeed all men are so and you are such a charming creature and have kept him at such a distance But no more of this subject Only my dear be not overnice now you are so near the state You see what difficulties you laid yourself under  when Tomlinson's letter called you again into  the wretch's  company  If you meet with no impediments no new causes of doubt  p  your reputation in the eye of the world is concerned that you should be his  and as your uncle rightly judges be thought to have been his before now  And yet  let me tell you  I can  hardly  bear  to think  that these libertines should be rewarded for their villainy with the best of the sex when the worst of it are too good for them  I shall send this long letter by Collins  p  who changes his day to oblige me As none of our letters by Wilson's conveyance have miscarried when you have been in more apparently disagreeable situations than you are in at present I  have no doubt  that this will go safe  Miss Lardner  p  whom you have seen at her cousin Biddulph's saw you at St James's Church on Sunday was fortnight She kept you in her eye during the whole time but could not once obtain the notice of yours tho' she courtesied to you twice She thought to pay her compliments to you when the service was over for she doubted not but you were marriedand for an odd reasonbecause you came to church by yourselfEvery eye as usual she said was upon you and this seeming to give you hurry and you being nearer the door than she you slid out before she could go to you But she order'd her servant to follow you till you were housed This servant saw you step into a chair which waited for you and you ordered the men to carry you to the place where they took you up She  describes the house  as a very gent  el house and fit to receive people of fashion  And what makes me mention this is that perhaps you will have a visit from her or message at least  So that you have Mr Doleman's testimony to the credit of the house and people you are with  p    and he is  a man of fortune and some reputation formerly a rake indeed but married to a woman of family and having had a palsyblow one would think a penitent You have  a  so Mr Mennell's at least passive testimony Mr  Tomlinson  's and now lastly Miss Lardner's so that there will be the less need for inquiry But you know my busy and inquisitive temper as well as my affection for you and my concern for your honour But all doubt will soon be lost in certainty  Nevertheless I must add that I would have you  command me up if I can be of the least service or pleasure to you  p  I value not fame I value not censure nor even life itself I verily think as I do your honour and your friendship For is not your honour my honour▪ And is not your friendship the pride of my life  May heaven preserve you my dearest creature in honour and safety is the prayer the hourly prayer of  Your ever faithful and affectionate ANNA HOWE  Thursday Morn    I have written all night  Excuse indifferent writing My crowquills are worn to the st  mps and I must get a new supply  These Ladies always write with crowquills Jack  If thou art capable of taking in all my  precautionaries  in this letter thou wilt admire my sagacity and contrivance almost as much as I do myself Thou  seest that Miss Lardner Mrs Sinclair Tomlinson Mrs Fretchville Mennell are all mentioned in it My first liberties with her person also Modesty  modesty Belford I doubt is more confined to time place and occasion even by the most delicate minds than those minds would have it believed to be And why all these taken notice of by me from the genuine  letter but for fear some future letter from the vixen should escape my hands in which she might refer to these names And if none of them were to have been found in this that is to pass for hers I might be routed  horse and foot  as Lord M would phrase it in a like case  Devilish hard and yet I may thank myself to be put to all this plague and troubleAnd for  what  dost thou ask O Jack for a triumph of more value to me  beforehand  than an imperial crownDon't ask me the value of it a  month hence  But what indeed is an imperial crown itself when a man is used to it  Miss Howe might well be anxious about the letter she wrote Her sweet friend from what I have let pass of hers has reason to rejoice in the thought that it fell not into my hands  And now must all my contrivances be set at work to intercept the expected letter from Miss Howe which is as I suppose to direct her to a place of safety and out of my knowlege Mrs Townsend is no doubt in this case to smuggle her off I hope the  villain  as I am so frequently called between these two girls will be able to manage this point  But what perhaps thou askest if the lady should take it into her head by the connivance of Miss Rawlins to quit this house privately in the night  I have thought of this Jack Does not Will lie in the house And is not the Widow Bevis my fast friend  LETTER IX  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Saturday    o'clock June    THE lady gave Will's sweetheart a letter last night to be carried to the posthouse as this morning directed for Miss Howe under cover to  Hickman I dare say neither cover nor letter will be seen to have been open'd The contents but eight linesTo own  The receipt of her doubledated letter in safety and referring to a longer letter which she intends to write when she shall have a quieter heart and less trembling fingers But mentions something to have happen'd My detecting her she means which has given her very great flutters confusions and apprehensions But which she will await the issue of Some hopes for me hence Jack before she gives her fresh perturbation or concern on her accountShe tells her how impatient she shall be for her next c  Now Belford I thought it would be but kind in me to save Miss Howe's concern on these alarming hints since the curiosity of such a spirit must have been prodigiously excited by them Having therefore so good a copy to imitate I wrote and taking out that of my Beloved put under the same cover the following short billet inscriptive and conclusive parts of it in her own words  Hamstead  Tuesday evening  My everdear Miss Howe  A Few lines only till calmer spirits and quieter fingers be granted me and till I can get over the shock which your intelligence has given meTo acquaint youthat your kind long letter of Wednesday and as I may say of Thursday morning is come safe to my hands On receipt of yours by my messenger to you I sent for it from Wilson's There thank heaven it lay May that heaven reward you for all your past and for all your  intended  goodness to  Your forever obliged  CL HARLOWE  I took great pains in writing this It cannot I hope be suspected Her hand is so  very  delicate  Yet hers is written less beautifully than she usually writes And I hope Miss Howe will allow somewhat for  hurry of spirits  and  unsteady fingers  My consideration for Miss Howe's  ease of mind  extended still farther than to the instance I have mentioned  That this billet might be with her as soon as possible and before it could have reach'd Hickman by the post I dispatch'd it away by a servant of Mowbray's Miss Howe had there been any failure or delay might as thou wilt think have communicated her anxieties to her fugitive friend and she  to me  perhaps in a way I should not have been pleased with  Once more wilt thou wonderingly questionAll this pains for a single girl  Yes Jack But is not this girl a CLARISSA And who knows but kind Fortune as a reward for my perseverance may toss me in her charming friend Less likely things have come to pass BelfordAnd to be sure I shall have her if I resolve upon it  LETTER X  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Eight o'clock Sat Morn June    I Am come back from Mrs Moore's whither I went in order to attend my charmer's commands But no admittance A very bad night  Doubtless she must be as much concern'd that she has carried her resentments so very far as I have reason to be that I made such a poor use of the opportunity I had on Wednesday night  But now Jack for a brief review of my present situation and a slight hint or two of my precautions  I have seen the women this morning and find them halfright halfdoubting  Miss Rawlins's brother tells her that she  lives  at Mrs Moores's  Mrs Moore can do nothing without Miss Rawlins  People who keep lodgings at public places expect to get by every one who comes into their purlieus Tho' not permitted to lodge there myself I have engag'd all the rooms she has to spare to the very garrets and  that  as I have told thee before for a month certain and at her own price board included my spouse's and all But she must not at present know it So I hope I have Mrs Moore fast  by the interest  This devillike is suiting temptations to inclinations  I have always observed and I believe I have  inted as much formerly  Vol  iii  p    that all dealers tho' but for pins may be taken in by customers for pins sooner than by a direct bribe of ten times the value especially if pretenders to conscience For the offer of a bribe would not only give room for suspicion but would startle and alarm their scrupulousness while a high price paid for what you buy is but submitting to be cheated in the method the person makes a profession to get by Have I not said that human nature is a rogue  Vol  iii  p    Vol  iv  p    And do not I know it  To give a higher instance How many proud senators in the year were induced by presents or subscriptions of South Sea stock to contribute to a scheme big with national ruin who yet would have spurn'd the man who should have presumed to offer them even twice the sum certain that they had a chance to gain by the stockBut to return to my  review  and my  precautions  Miss Rawlins fluctuates as she hears the lady's story or as she hears mine Somewhat of an infidel I doubt is this Miss Rawlins I have not yet  consider'd  her  foible The next time I see her I will take particular notice of all the moles and freckles in her mind and then  infer  and  apply  The Widow Bevis as I have told thee is all my own  My man Will lies in the house My other new fellow attends upon  me  and cannot therefore be quite stupid  Already is Will over head and ears in love with one of Mrs Moore's maids He was struck with her the moment he set his eyes upon her A raw country wench too But all women from the countess to the cookmaid are put into high good humour with themselves when a man is taken with them at first sight Be they ever so  plain  No woman can be  ugly  Jack they'll find twenty good reasons besides the great one for  Sake's sake  by the help of the glass without and perhaps in spite of it and conceit within to justify the honest fellow's  caption  "The rogue has saved l in my service" More by than I bid him save No doubt he thinks he  might  have done so tho' I believe not worth a groat  The best of masters IPassionate indeed But soon appeased  The wench is extremely kind to him already The other maid is also very civil to him He has a husband for  her  in his eye She cannot but say that Mr Andrew my  other  servant The girl is for fixing the  person  is a very wellspoken civil young man  We common folks have our joys and please your Honour says honest Joseph Leman like as our betters have  Vol  iii  p      And true says honest JosephDid I prefer ease to difficulty I should envy these lowdegree sinners some of their joys  But if Will had  not  made amorous pretensions to the wenches we all know that servants united in  one common  comparenote  cause are intimate the moment they see one anotherGreat genealogists too they know immediately the whole kin and kin's kin of each other tho' dispersed over the three kingdoms as well as the genealogies and kin's kin of those they serve  But my precautions end not here  O Jack with such an invention what occasion had I to carry my Beloved to Mrs Sinclair's  My spouse may have further occasion for the messengers whom she dispatch'd one to Miss Howe the other to Wilson's With one of these Will is already wellacquainted as thou hast heardTo mingle liquor is to mingle souls with these fellows With the other he will soon be acquainted if he be not  already  The Captain's servant has  his  uses and instructions assign'd him I have hinted at some of them already  Page    of this Volume    He  also serves a most humane and considerate master I love to make everybody respected to my power  The post general and peny will be strictly watch'd likewise  Miss Howe's Collins is remember'd to be described Miss Howe's and Hickman's liveries also  James Harlowe and Singleton are warned against I am to be acquainted with any inquiry that shall happen to be made after my spouse whether by her married or maiden name before  she  shall be told of itAnd this that I may have it in my power to  prevent mischief  I have order'd Mowbray and Tourville and Belton if his health permit to take their quarters at Hamstead for a week with their fellows to attend them I spare thee for the present because of thy private  concerns But hold thyself in chearful readiness however as a mark of thy  allegiance  As to my spouse herself has she not reason to be pleased with me for having permitted her to receive Miss Howe's letter from Wilson's A plain case either that I am no deep plotter or that I have no further views but to make my peace with her for an offence so slight and so  accidental  Miss Howe says tho' prefaced with an  alas  that her charming friend loves me She must therefore yearn after this reconciliationProspects so fairIf she used me with less rigor and more politeness if she shewed me any  compassion  seemed inclinable to spare me and to make the most favourable constructions I cannot but say that it would be impossible not to shew  her  some But to be insulted and defied by a rebel in one's power what prince can bear that  But I return to the scene of action I must keep the women steady I had no opportunity to talk to my worthy Mrs Bevis in private  Tomlinson a dog not come yet  LETTER XI  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  From my apartments at Mrs Moore's  MISS Rawlins at her brother's Mrs Moore engaged in houshold matters Widow Bevis dressing I have nothing to do but write This cursed Tomlinson not yet arrived Nothing to be done without him  I think he shall complain in pretty high language of the treatment he met with yesterday  What are our affairs to him He can have no view but to serve us Cruel to send back to town  unaudienced  unseen a man of his business and importance  He never stirs a foot but something of consequence depends upon his movements A confounded thing to trifle thus humoursomely with such a gentleman's moments These women think that all the business of the world must stand still for their  figaries  A good female word Jack The greatest triflers in the creation to fancy themselves the most important beings in it  Marry come up  as I have heard Goody Sorlings say to her servants when she has rated at them with mingled anger and disdain  After all methinks I want these  tostications  Thou seest how women and womens words fill my mind to be over  happily  over that I may sit down quietly and reflect upon the dangers I have passed thro' and the troubles I have undergone I have a  reflecting  mind as thou knowest but the very word implies  All got over  What bryars and thorns does the wretch rush into a scratch'd face and tatter'd garments the unavoidable consequence who will needs be for striking out a new path thro' overgrown underwood quitting  that  beaten out for him by those who have travelled the same road before him  A VISIT from the Widow Bevis in my own apartment She tells me that my spouse had thoughts last night after I was gone to my lodgings of removing from Mrs Moore's I almost wish she had attempted to do so  Miss Rawlins it seems who was apply'd to upon it dissuaded her from it  Mrs Moore also tho' she did not own that Will lay in the house or rather sat up in it courting set before her the difficulties which in her opinion she would have to get clear off without my knowlege assuring her that she could be nowhere safer  than with her till she had fixed whither to go And the lady herself recollected that if she went she might miss the expected letter from her dear friend Miss Howe which as she owned was to direct her future steps  She must also surely have some curiosity to know what her uncle's friend had to say to her from her uncle contemptuously as she yesterday treated a man of his importance Nor could she I should think be absolutely determin'd to put herself out of the way of receiving the visits of two of the principal ladies of my family and to break intirely with me in the face of them allBesides whither could she have goneMoreover Miss Howe's letter coming after her elopement so safely to her hands must surely put her into a more confiding temper with me and with every one else tho' she would not immediately own it  But these good folks have so  little  charityAre such  severe  censurersYet who is  absolutely perfect  It were to be wished however that  they  would be so modest as to doubt themselves sometimes Then would they allow for others as others excellent as they imagine themselves to be must for them  Saturday one o'clock  TOMLINSON at last is come Forced to ride five miles about tho' I shall impute his delay to great and important business to avoid the sight of two or three impertinent rascals who little thinking whose affairs he was employ'd in wanted to obtrude themselves upon him I think I will make this fellow easy if he behave to my liking in this affair  I sent up the moment he came  She desired to be excused receiving his visit till four this afternoon  Intolerable  No considerationNone at all in  this sex when their cursed humours are in the way Payday pay  hour  rather will comeO that it were to be the next  The Captain is in a pet Who can blame him Even the women think a man of his consequence and generously coming to serve us hardly used Would to heaven she had attempted to get off last night The women not my enemies who knows but the husband's exerted authority might have met with such connivance as might have concluded either in carrying her back to her former lodgings or in consummation at Mrs Moore's in spite of exclamations fits and the rest of the female obsecrations  My beloved has not appeared to anybody this day except to Mrs Moore Is it seems extremely low Unfit for the interesting conversation that is to be held in the afternoon Longs to hear from her dear friend Miss HoweYet cannot expect a letter for a day or two Has a bad opinion of all mankindNo wonderExcellent creature as she is with such a  father  such  uncles  such a  brother  as she has  How does she look  Better than could be expected from yesterday's fatigue and last night's ill rest  These tender doves know not till put to it what they can bear especially when engaged in loveaffairs and their attention wholly engrossed But the sex love busy scenes Stilllife is their aversion A woman will  create  a storm rather than be without one So as they can preside in the whirlwind and direct it they are happyBut my beloved's misfortune is that she must live in tumults yet neither raise them herself nor be able to controul them  LETTER XII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Sat Night June    WHAT will be the issue of all my plots and contrivances devil take me if I am able to divine But I will not as Lord M would say  forestall my own market  At four the appointed hour I sent up to desire admittance in the Captain's name and my own  She would wait upon the  Captain  presently Not upon  me  and in the parlour if it were not engaged  The diningroom being  mine  perhaps that was the reason of her naming the parlourMighty nice again if soNo good sign for me thought I this stiffness  In the parlour with me and the Captain were Mrs Moore Miss Rawlins and Mrs Bevis  The women said they would withdraw when the Lady came down  Lovel  Not except she chooses you should LadiesPeople who are so much aboveboard as I am need not make secrets of any of their affairs Besides you three Ladies are now acquainted with all our concerns  Capt  I have some things to say to your Lady that perhaps she would not herself choose that anybody should hear not even  you  Mr Lovelace as you and her family are not upon such a good foot of understanding as were to be wished  Lovel  Well well Captain I must submit Give us a sign to withdraw and we will withdraw  It was better that the exclusion of the women should come from him than from me  Capt  I will bow and wave my hand thus when I wish to be alone with the lady Her uncle dotes upon her I hope Mr Lovelace you will not make a reconciliation more difficult for the earnestness which my dear friend shews to bring it to bear But indeed I must tell you  as I told you more than once before  that I am afraid you have made lighter of the occasion of this misunderstanding to me than it ought to have been made  Lovel  I hope Captain Tomlinson you do not question my veracity  Capt  I beg your pardon Mr LovelaceBut those things which we men may think lightly of may not be so to a lady of delicacyAnd then if you  have  bound yourself by a vow you ought  Miss Rawlins bridling her lips closed  but her mouth stretched to a smile of approbation the longer for not buttoning  tacitly shewed herself pleased with the Captain for his delicacy  Mrs Moore  could  speak  Very true  however was all she said with a motion of her head that expressed the bowapprobatory  For my part said the jolly widow staring with eyes as big as eggs I know what I knowBut Man and Wife  are  Man and Wife or they are  not  Man and WifeI have no notion of standing upon such niceties  But here she comes cried onehearing her chamberdoor openHere she comes anotherhearing it shut after herAnd down dropt the angel among us  We all stood up bowing and courtesying and could not help it For she entered with such an air as commanded all our reverence Yet the Captain look'd plaguy grave  Cl  Pray keep your seats LadiesPray do not go  For they made offers to withdraw yet Miss Rawlins  would have burst had she been suffer'd to retire  Before this time you have heard all my story I make no doubtPray keep your seatsAt least all Mr Lovelace's  A very saucy and whimsical beginning thought I  Capt Tomlinson your servant addressing herself to him with inimitable dignity I hope you did not take amiss my declining your visit yesterday I was really incapable of talking upon any subject that required attention  Capt  I am glad I see you better now Madam I hope I do  Cl  Indeed I am not well I would not have excused myself from attending you some hours ago but in hopes I should have been better I beg your pardon Sir for the trouble I have given you and shall the rather expect it as  this day will  I hope  conclude it all  Thus set thus determin'd thought IYet to have  slept  upon itBut as what she said was capable of a good as well as a bad construction I would not put an unfavourable one upon it  Lovel  The Captain was sorry my dear he did not offer his attendance the moment he arrived yesterday He was afraid that you took it amiss that he did not  Cl  Perhaps I thought that my  uncle  's friend might have wished to see me as soon as he came How we staredBut Sir  to me  it might be  convenient to you  to detain him  The devil thought ISo there really was resentment as well as headach as my good friend Mrs Bevis observed in her refusing to see the honest gentleman  Capt  You  would  detain me Mr LovelaceI was for paying my respects to the lady the moment I came  Cl  Well Sir  interrupting him  to wave this for I would not be thought captiousIf you have not suffer'd inconveniency in being obliged to come again I shall be easy  Capt  halfdisconcerted  A  little  I can't say but I have I have indeed too many affairs upon my hands But the desire I have to serve you and Mr Lovelace as well as to oblige my dear friend your uncle Harlowe make great inconveniencies but small ones  Cl  You are very obliging SirHere is a great alteration since you parted with us last  Capt  A great one indeed Madam I was very much surprised at it on Thursday evening when Mr Lovelace conducted me to your lodgings where we hoped to find you  Cl  Have you any thing to say to me Sir from my uncle himself that requires my  private  ear Don't go Ladies  for the women stood up and offer'd to withdraw  If Mr Lovelace stays I am sure  you  may  I frown'd I bit my lip I looked at the women and shook my head  Capt  I have nothing to offer but what Mr Lovelace is a party to and may hear except one private word or two which may be postponed to the last  Cl  Pray Ladies keep your seatsThings are altered Sir since I saw you You can mention nothing that relates to  me  now to which  that gentleman  can be a party  Capt  You surprise me Madam I am sorry to hear thisSorry for your  uncle  's sakeSorry for  your  sakeSorry for Mr  Lovelace  's sakeAnd yet I am sure he must have given greater occasion than he has mentioned to me or  Lovel  Indeed Captain Indeed Ladies I have told you great part of my storyAnd what I told you of my offence was the truthWhat I concealed  of my story was only what I apprehended would if known cause this dear creature to be thought more censorious than charitable  Cl  Well well Sir say what you please Make me as black as you please Make yourself as white as you can I am not now in your power That will comfort me for all  Capt  God forbid that I should offer to plead in behalf of a crime that a lady of virtue and honour cannot forgive But surely surely Madam this is going too far  Cl  Do not blame me Capt Tomlinson I have a good opinion of you as my  uncle  's friend But if you are Mr  Lovelace  's friend that is another thing for my interests and Mr Lovelace's must now be for ever separated  Capt  One word with you Madam if you please offering to retire  Cl  You may say all that you please to say before these gentlewomen Mr Lovelace may have secrets I have none You seem to think me faulty I should be glad that all the world knew my heart Let my enemies sit in judgment upon my actions Fairly scanned I fear not the result Let them even ask me my most secret thoughts and whether they make for me or against me I will reveal them  Capt  Noble Lady who can say as you say  The women held up their hands and eyes each as if she had said Not I  No disorder here said Miss Rawlins But judging by her own heart A confounded deal of improbability I believe she thought  Finely  said  to be sure said the widow Bevis shrugging her shoulders  Mrs Moore sighed  Jack Belford thought I knows all mine And in this I am more ingenuous than any of the three and a fit match for this paragon  Cl  How Mr Lovelace has found me out here I cannot tell But such mean devices such artful such worse than Waltham disguises put on to obtrude himself into my company such bold such shocking untruths  Capt  The favour of but one word Madam in private  Cl  In order to support a right which he has not over meO Sir O Capt TomlinsonI think I have reason to say that the man is capable of any vileness  The women looked upon one another and upon me by turns to see how I bore it I had such dartings in my head at the instant that I thought I should have gone distracted My brain seemed on fire What would I have given to have had her alone with meI traversed the room my clenched fist to my forehead O that I had anybody here thought I that Herculeslike when flaming in the tortures of Deianira's poison'd shirt I could tear in pieces  Capt  Dear Lady see you not how the poor gentlemanLord how have I imposed upon your uncle at this rate How happy did I tell him I saw you How happy I was sure you would be in each other  Cl  Oh Sir you don't know how many premeditated offences I had forgiven when I saw you last before I could appear to you what I hoped then I might for the future beBut now you may tell my uncle if you please that I cannot hope for his mediation Tell him that my guilt in giving this man an opportunity to spirit me away from my  try'd  my  experienced  my  natural  friends harshly as they treated me stares me every day more and more in the face and still the more as my fate seems to be drawing to a crisis according to the malediction of my offended father  And then she burst into tears which even affected that dog who brought to abet me was himself all  Belforded  over  The women so used to cry without grief as they are to laugh without reason by mere force of example confound their promptitudes must needs pull out  their  handkerchiefs The less wonder however as I myself between confusion surprize and concern could hardly stand it  What's a tender heart good forWho can be happy that has a  feeling  heartAnd yet thou'lt say that he who has it not must be a tyger and no man  Capt  Let me beg the favour of one word with you Madam in private and that on my  own  account  The women hereupon offered to retire She insisted that if  they  went  I  should not stay  Capt  Sir bowing to me shall I beg  I hope thought I that I may trust this solemn dog instructed as he is She does not doubt him I'll stay out no longer than to give her time to spend her first fire  I then passively withdrew with the womenBut with such a bow to my goddess that it won for me every heart but that I wanted  most  to win for the haughty maid bent not her knee in return  The conversation between the Captain and the Lady when we were retired was to the following effect They both talked loud enough for me to hear them The Lady from anger the Captain with design and thou mayst be sure there was no listener but myself What I was imperfect in was supply'd afterwards for I had my vellomleav'd book to note all downIf she had known this perhaps she would have been more sparing of her invectives and but  perhaps  neither  He told her that as her brother was absolutely resolved to see her and as he himself in compliance with her uncle's expedient had reported her marriage and as that report had reached the ears of Lord M Lady Betty and the rest of my relations and as he had been obliged in consequence of his first report to vouch it and as her brother might find out where she was and apply to the women here for a confirmation or refutation of the marriage he had thought himself obliged to countenance the report before the women That this had embarassed him not a little as he would not for the world that she should have cause to think him capable of prevarication contrivance or doubledealing And that this made him desirous of a private conversation with her  It was true she said she  had  given her consent to such an expedient believing it was her  uncle  's and little thinking that it would lead to so many errors Yet she might have known that one error is frequently the parent of many Mr Lovelace had made her sensible of the truth of that observation on more occasions than one and it was an observation that he the Captain had made in one of the letters that was shewn her yesterday  Page    of this Volume    He hoped that she had no mistrust of  him  That she had no doubts of  his honour  If Madam you suspect meIf you think me capableWhat a man The Lord be merciful to meWhat a man must you think me  I hope Sir there cannot be a man in the world who could deserve to be suspected in such a case as this I do  not  suspect you If it were possible there could be  one  such man I am sure Capt Tomlinson a father of children a man in years of sense and experience cannot be that man  He told me that just then he thought he felt a sudden flash from her eye an  eyebeam  as he called it dart thro' his shivering reins and he could not help trembling  The dog's conscience Jack Nothing elseI have felt half a dozen such flashes such eyebeams in as many different conversations with this soulpiercing beauty  Her uncle she must own was not accustom'd to think of such expedients But she had reconciled this to herself as the case was unhappily uncommon and by the regard he had for her honour  This set the puppy's heart at ease and gave him more courage  She asked him If he thought Lady Betty and Miss Montague intended her a visit  He had no doubt but they did  And does he imagine said she that I could be brought to countenance to them the report you have given out    I had hoped to bring her to this Jack or she had not seen their letters  But I had told the Captain that I believe I must give up this expectation  No He believed that I had not such a thought He was pretty sure that I intended when I saw  them  to tell them as in confidence the naked truth  He then told her that her uncle had already made some steps towards a general reconciliation The moment Madam that he knows you are really married he will enter into conference with your  father  upon it having actually expressed his desire to be reconciled to you to your  mother  And what Sir said my mother What said my  dear  mother with great emotion holding out her sweet face as the Captain described her with the most earnest attention as if she would shorten  the way which his words were to have to her heart  Your mother Madam burst into tears upon it And your uncle was so penetrated by  her  tenderness that he could not proceed with the subject But he intends to enter upon it with her in form as soon as he hears that the ceremony is over  By the tone of her voice she wept The dear creature thought I begins to relentAnd I grudg'd the dog his eloquence I could hardly bear the thought that any man breathing should have the power which I had lost of persuading this highsoul'd lady tho' in my own favour And wouldst thou think it this reflection gave me more uneasiness at the moment than I felt from her reproaches violent as they were or than I had pleasure in her supposed relenting For there is beauty in everything she says and does Beauty in her passion Beauty in her tearsHad the Captain been a young fellow and of rank and fortune his throat would have been in danger and I should have thought very hardly of her  O Capt Tomlinson said she you know not what I have suffer'd by this man's strange ways He had as I was not ashamed to tell him yesterday a  plain path before him  He at first betray'd me into his power But when I  was  in itThere she stopt Then resumingO Sir you know not what a strange man he has beenAn unpolite a roughmanner'd manIn disgrace of his birth and education and knowlege an unpolite manAnd so acting as if his worldly and personal advantages set him above those graces which distinguish a gentleman  The first woman that ever said or that ever thought so of me that's my comfort thought I But this spoken to her  uncle's friend  behind my back helps to heap up thy already toofull measure dearestIt is down in my vellombook  Cl  When I look back on his whole behaviour to a poor young creature for I am but a  very  young creature I cannot acquit him either of great folly or of deep designAnd last Wednesday  There she stopt and I suppose turn'd away her face I wonder she was not asham'd to hint at what she thought so shameful and that to a  man  and  alone  with him  Capt  Far be it from me Madam to offer to enter too closely into so tender a subject He owns that you have reason to be displeased with him But he so solemnly clears himself to me of  premeditated  offence  Cl  He cannot clear himself Mr Tomlinson The people of the house must be very vile as well as he I am convinced that there was a wicked confederacyBut no more upon such a subject  Capt  Only one word more Madam He tells me that he gave you such an instance of your power over him as never man gave And that you promised to pardon him  Cl  He knew that he deserved not pardon or he had not extorted that promise from me Nor had I given it to him but to shield myself from the vilest outrage  Capt  I could wish Madam inexcusable as his behaviour has been since he has  something  to plead in the reliance he made upon your  promise  that for the sake of appearances to the world and to avoid the mischiefs that may follow if you absolutely break with him you could prevail upon your naturally generous mind to lay an obligation upon him by your forgiveness  She was silent  Capt  Your father and mother Madam deplore a daughter lost to them whom your generosity to Mr Lovelace may restore Do not put it to the possible chance that they may have cause to deplore a  double loss the losing of a  son  as well as a  daughter  who by his own violence which you may perhaps prevent may be for ever lost to them and to the whole family  She paused She wept She owned that she felt the force of this argument  I will be the making of this fellow thought I  Capt  Permit me Madam to tell you that I do not think it would be difficult to prevail upon your uncle if you insist upon it to come up privately to town and to give you with his own hand to Mr LovelaceExcept indeed your present misunderstanding were to come to his ears  Cl  But why Sir should I be so much afraid of my  brother  My brother has injured  me  not I  him  Shall I seek protection from my brother of Mr Lovelace And who shall protect me from Mr LovelaceWill the one offer to me what the other has offer'dWicked ungrateful man to insult a friendless unprotected creature made friendless by himselfI cannot cannot think of him in the light I once thought of him He has no business with me Let him leave me Let my brother find me I am not such a poor creature as to be afraid to face the brother who has injured me  Capt  Were you and your brother to meet only to confer together to expostulate to clear up difficulties it were another thing But what Madam can you think will be the issue of an interview Mr Solmes with him when he finds you  unmarried  and resolved never to have Mr Lovelace supposing Mr Lovelace were  not  to interfere which cannot be supposed  Cl  Well Sir I can only say I am a very unhappy creatureI must resign to the will of Providence and be patient under evils which  that  will not permit me to shun But I have taken my measures Mr Lovelace can never make  me  happy nor  I  him  I wait here only for a letter from Miss Howe That must determine me  Determine you as to Mr Lovelace Madam interrupted the Captain  Cl  I am already determin'd as to him  Capt  If it be not in his favour I have done I cannot use stronger arguments than I have used and it would be impertinent to repeat themIf you cannot forgive his offence I am sure it must have been much greater than he has owned to meIf you are absolutely determined be pleased to let me know what I shall say to your uncle You was pleased to tell me that this day would put an end to what you called my trouble I should not have thought it any could I have been an humble means of reconciling persons of worth and honour to each other  Here I enter'd with a solemn air  Lovel  Mr Tomlinson I have heard a great part of what has passed between you and this unforgiving however otherwise excellent lady I am cut to the heart to find the dear creature so determined I could not have believed it possible with such prospects that I had so little a share in her esteem Nevertheless I must do myself justice with regard to the offence I was so unhappy as to give since I find you are ready to think it much greater than it really was  Cl  I hear not Sir your recapitulations I am and ought to be the sole judge of insults offered to my person I enter not into discussion with you nor hear you on the shocking subject And was going  I put myself between her and the doorYou  may  hear all I have to say Madam My  fault  is not o  such a nature but that you  may  I will be a just accuser of myself and will not wound your ears  I then protested that the fire was a real fire So it was I disclaimed less truly indeed premeditation I owned that I was hurried on by the violence of a youthful passion and by a sudden impulse  which few other persons in the like situation would have been able to check That I withdrew at her command and intreaty on the promise of  pardon  without having offered the least indecency or any freedom that would not have been forgiven by persons of delicacy surprised in an attitude so charmingHer terror on the alarm of fire calling for a soothing behaviour and personal tenderness she being ready to fall into fits My hopedfor happy day so near that I might be presumed to be looked upon as a betrothed loverAnd that this excuse might be pleaded even for the women of the house that they thinking us actually married might suppose themselves to be the less concerned to interfere on so tender an occasionThere Jack was a bold insinuation in behalf of the women  High indignation filled her disdainful eye eyebeam after eyebeam flashing at me Every feature of her sweet face had soul in it Yet she spoke not Perhaps Jack she had a thought that this  plea for the women  accounted for my contrivance to have her pass to them as married when I  first carried her thither  Capt  Indeed Sir I must say that you did not well to add to the apprehensions of a lady so much terrified before  She offer'd to go by me I set my back against the door and besought her to stay a few moments I had not said thus much my dearest creature but for your sake as well as for my own that Captain Tomlinson should not think I had been viler than I was Nor will I say one word more on the subject after I have appealed to your own heart whether it was not necessary that I should say so much and to the Captain whether otherwise he would not have gone away with a much worse opinion of me if he  had judged of my offence by the violence of your resentment  Capt  Indeed I  should  I  own  I should And I am very glad Mr Lovelace that you are able to defend yourself thus far  Cl  That cause must be well tried where the offender takes his seat upon the same bench with the judgeI submit not mine to menNor give me leave to say to You Captain Tomlinson tho' I am willing to have a good opinion of you Had not the man been assured that he had influenced you in his favour he would not have brought you up to Hamstead  Capt  That I am  influenced  as you call it Madam is for the sake of your uncle and for your own sake more I will say to Mr Lovelace's face than for his What can I have in view but peace and reconciliation I have from the  first  blamed and I now  again  blame Mr Lovelace for adding distress to distress and terror to terror the lady as you acknowlege Sir    looking valiantly    ready  before  to fall into fits  Lovel  Let me own to you Captain Tomlinson that I have been a very faulty a very foolish man and if this dear creature  ever  honoured me with her love an  ingrateful  one But I have had too much reason to doubt it And this is now a flagrant proof that she never had the value for me which my proud heart wished for that with such prospects before us a day so near settlements approved and drawn her uncle mediating a reconciliation which for  her  sake not  my own  I was desirous to give into she can for an offence so  really  slight on an occasion so  truly  accidental renounce me for ever and with me all hopes of that reconciliation in the way her uncle had put it in and she had acquiesced with and  risque all consequences fatal ones as they may too possibly beBy my soul Captain Tomlinson the dear creature must have hated me all the time she was intending to honour me with her hand And now she must resolve to abandon me as far as I know with a preference in her heart of the most odious of menin favour of  that Solmes  who as you tell me accompanies her brother And with what hopes with what view accompanies himHow can I bear to think of this  Cl  It is fit Sir that you should judge of my regard for you by your own conscious demerits Yet you know or you would not have dared to behave to me as sometimes you did that you had more of it than you deserved  She walked from us and then returning Captain Tomlinson said she I will own to you that I was not capable of resolving to give my  hand  and  nothing but my hand  Have I not given a flagrant proof of this to the once most indulgent of parents which has brought me into a distress which this man has heightened when he ought in gratitude and honour to have endeavoured to render it supportable I had even a  byas  Sir in his favour I scruple not to own it Long too long bore I with his unaccountable ways attributing his errors to unmeaning gaiety and to a want of knowing what true delicacy and true generosity required from a heart susceptible of grateful impressions to one involved by his means in unhappy circumstances It is now  wickedness  in him a wickedness which discredits all his  professions  to say that his last cruel and ingrateful insult was not a  premeditated  oneBut what need I say more of this insult when it was of such a nature that it has changed that byas in his favour and made me choose to forego all the inviting prospects he  talks of and to run all hazards to free myself from his power  O my dearest creature how happy for us both had I been able to  discover that byas  as you condescend to call it thro' such reserves as man never encountered with  He did  discover  it Captain Tomlinson He brought me  more than once to own it  the more needlesly brought me to own it as I dare say his own  vanity  gave him  no cause to doubt it  and as I had no other motive in not being  forward  to own it than my too just apprehensions of his want of generosity In a word Captain Tomlinson and now that I am determined upon my measures I the less scruple to say it I should have despised myself had I found myself capable of affectation or tyranny to the man I intended to marry I have always blamed the dearest friend I have in the world for a fault of this nature In a word  Lovel  And had my angel really and indeed the favour for me she is pleased to ownDearest creature forgive me Restore me to your good opinion Surely I have not sinned beyond forgiveness You say that I extorted from you the promise you made me But I could not have presumed to make that promise the condition of my obedience had I not thought there was room to expect forgiveness Permit I beseech you the prospects to take place that were opening so agreeably before us I will go to town and bring the licence All difficulties to the obtaining of it are surmounted Captain Tomlinson shall be witness to the deeds He will be present at the ceremony on the part of your uncle Indeed he gave me hope that your uncle himself  Capt  I  did  Mr Lovelace And I will tell you my grounds for the hope I gave I proposed to my  dear friend Your uncle Madam that he should give out that he would take a turn with me to my little farmhouse as I call it near Northampton for a week or soPoor gentleman he has of late been very little abroad Too visibly indeed declineingChange of air it might be given out was good for himBut I see Madam that this is too  tender  a subject  The dear creature wept She knew how to apply as meant the Captain's hint to the  occasion  of her uncle's declining state of health  Capt  We might indeed I told him set out in that road but turn short to town  in my chariot  and he might see the ceremony performed with his own eyes and be the desired father as well as the beloved uncle  She turned from us and wiped her eyes  Capt  And really there seem now to be but two objections to this as Mr Harlowe discouraged not the proposalThe one the unhappy misunderstanding between you which I would not by any means he should know since then he might be apt to give weight to Mr James Harlowe's unjust surmizes The other that it would necessarily occasion some delay to the ceremony which I cannot see but may be performed in a day or twoIf  And then he reverently bowed to my goddess Charming fellowBut often did I curse my stars for making me so much obliged to his adroitness  She was going to speak but not liking the turn of her countenance altho' as I thought its severity and indignation seemed a little abated I said and had like to have blown myself up by itOne expedient I have just thought of  Cl  None of your expedients Mr Lovelace I abhor your expedients your inventionsI have had too many of them  Lovel  See Capt TomlinsonSee SirO how we expose ourselves to youLittle did you think I dare say that we have lived in such a continued misunderstanding together But you will make the best of it all We may yet be happy O that I could have been assured that this dear lady loved me with the hundredth part of the love I have for herOur diffidences have been mutual This dear creature has too much punctilio I am afraid that I have too little Hence our difficulties But I have a heart Capt Tomlinson a heart that bids me hope for her love because it is resolved to deserve it as much as man  can  deserve it  Capt  I am indeed surprised at what I have seen and heard I defend not Mr Lovelace Madam in the offence he has given youAs a father of daughters myself I  cannot  defend him tho' his fault seems to be lighter than I had apprehendedBut in my conscience I think that you Madam cany your resentment too high  Cl  Too high SirToo high to the man that might have been happy if he wouldToo high to the man that has held  my soul in suspense  an hundred times since by artifice and deceit he obtained a power over meSay Lovelace thyself say Art thou not the  very  Lovelace that by insulting  me  hast wrong'd thy  own hopes  The wretch that appeared in vile disguises personating an old lame creature seeking for lodgings for thy sick wifeTelling the gentlewomen here stories all of thy own invention and asserting to them an husband's right over me which thou hadst notAnd is it  turning to the Captain  to be expected that I should give credit to the protestations of such a man  Lovel  Treat me dearest creature as you please I will bear it And yet your scorn and your violence have fixed daggers in my heartBut was it possible  without those disguises to come at your speech And could I lose you if study if invention would put it in my power to arrest your anger and give me hope to engage you to confirm to me the  promised pardon  The address I made to you before the women as if the marriageceremony had passed was in consequence of what your uncle  had advised  and what  you had acquiesced with  and the rather made as your brother and Singleton and Solmes were resolved to find out whether what was reported of your marriage were true or not that they might take their measures accordingly and in hopes to prevent that mischief which I have been but too studious to prevent since this tameness has but invited insolence from your brother and his confederates  Cl  O thou strange wretch how thou talkest But Captain Tomlinson give me leave to say that were I inclin'd to talk any farther upon this subject I would appeal to Miss Rawlins's judgment Who else have I to appeal to she seems to be a person of prudence and honour but not to any  man  's judgment whether I carry my resentment beyond fit bounds when I resolve  Capt  Forgive Madam the interruptionBut I think there can be no reason for this You ought as you said to be the  sole judge  of indignities offered you The gentlewomen here are strangers to you You will perhaps stay but a little while among them If you lay the state of your case before any of them and your brother come to inquire of them your uncle's intended mediation will be discover'd and rendered abortive  I  shall appear in a light that I never appeared in in my lifefor these women may not think themselves obliged to keep the secret  Cl  O what difficulties has one fatal step involved me inBut there is no necessity for such an appeal I am resolved on my measures  Capt  Absolutely  resolved Madam  Cl  I am  Capt  What shall I say to your uncle Harlowe MadamPoor gentleman how will he be surprised You see Mr LovelaceYou see Sir turning to me with a flourishing handBut you may thank yourselfand admirably stalk'd he from us  True by my soul  thought I I traversed the room and bit my unpersuasive lips now upper now under for vexation  He made a profound reverence to herAnd went to the window where lay his hat and whip and taking them up open'd the door Child said he to somebody he saw pray order my servant to bring my horse to the door  Lovel  You won't go SirI hope you won't I am the unhappiest man in the worldYou won't goYet alas But you won't go Sir There may be yet hopes that Lady Betty may have some weight  Capt  Dear  Mr Lovelace and may not my worthy friend an affectionate uncle hope for some influence upon his  daughterniece  But I beg pardon A letter will always find me disposed to serve the lady and that as well for her sake as for the sake of my dear friend  She had thrown herself into a chair her eyes cast down She was motionless as in a profound study  The Captain bowed to her again But met with no return to his bow  Mr Lovelace  said he with an air of equality and independence  I am Yours  Still the dear unaccountable sat as immoveable as a statue stirring neither hand foot head nor eye I never before saw any one in so profound a resverie in so waking a dream  He passed by her to go out at the door she sat near tho' the other door was his direct way and  bowed again She moved not I will not disturb the lady in her meditations SirAdieu Mr Lovelace  No farther I beseech you  She started sighingAre you going Sir  Capt  I am Madam I could have been glad to do you service But I see it is not in my power  She stood up holding out one hand with inimitable dignity and sweetnessI am sorry you are going SirI can't help itI have no friend to advise withMr Lovelace has the art or goodfortune perhaps I should call it to make himself many Well SirIf you will go I can't help it  Capt  I will  not  go Madam his eyes twinkling  Again seized with a fit of humanity  I will  not  go if my longer stay can do you either service or pleasure What Sir  turning to me  what Mr Lovelace was your expedientPerhaps something may be offer'd Madam  She sighed and was silent  REVENGE  invoked I to myself keep thy throne in my heartIf the usurper  LOVE  once more drive thee from it thou wilt never regain possession  Lovel  What I had thought of what I had intended to propose and I sigh'dwas this That the dear creature if she will not forgive me as she promised would suspend the displeasure she has conceived against me till Lady Betty arrives That lady may be the mediatrix between us This dear creature may put herself into  her  protection and accompany her down to her seat in Oxfordshire It is one of her Ladyship's purposes to prevail on her supposed new niece to go down with her It may pass to every one but to Lady Betty and to you Capt Tomlinson and to your friend Mr Harlowe as he desires that we have been some time married And her being with my relations will amount to a proof to James Harlowe that we  are  and our nuptials may  be privately and at this beloved creature's pleasure solemnized and your report Captain authenticated  Capt  Upon my honour Madam clapping his hand upon his breast a charming expedient This will answer every end  She musedShe was greatly perplexedAt last God direct me said she I know not what to do A young unfriended creature whom have I to advise withLet me retire if I  can  retire  She withdrew with slow and trembling feet and went up to her chamber  For Heaven's sake said the penetrated varlet his hands lifted up for Heaven's sake take compassion upon this admirable ladyI cannot proceedI cannot proceedShe deserves all things  Softlydamn the fellowThe women are coming in  He sobb'd up his griefturn'd abouthemm'd up a more  manly  accentWipe thy cursed eyesHe did The sunshine took place on one cheek and spread slowly to the other and the fellow had his whole face again  The women all three came in led by that evercurious Miss Rawlins I told them that the lady was gone up to consider of everything That we had hopes of her And such a representation we made of all that had passed as brought either tacit or declared blame upon the fair perverse for hardness of heart and overdelicacy  The widow Bevis in particular put out one lip tossed up her head wrinkled her forehead and made such motions with her nowliftedup now castdown eyes as shew'd that she thought there was a great deal of perverseness and affectation in the lady Nowandthen she changed her censuring looks to looks of pity of meBut as she said She loved not to aggravateA poor business  God help's  shrugging up  her shoulders to make such a rout about and then her eyes laugh'd heartily Indulgence was a good thing Love was a good thingBut too much was too much  Miss Rawlins however declared after she had called the Widow Bevis with a prudish simper a  comical gentlewoman  That there must be something in our story which she could not fathom and went from us into a corner and sat down seemingly vexed that she could not  LETTER XIII  Mr  LOVELACE  In Continuation  THE lady staying longer above than we wished and hoping that ladylike she only waited for an invitation to return to us I desired the Widow Bevis in the Captain's name who wanted to go to town to request the favour of her company  I cared not to send up either Miss Rawlins or Mrs Moore on the errand lest my beloved should be in a  communicative disposition  especially as she had hinted at an appeal to Miss Rawlins who besides has such an unbounded curiosity  Mrs Bevis presently return'd with an answer winking and pinking at me that the lady would follow her down Miss Rawlins could not but offer to retire as the others did Her eyes however intimated that she had rather stay But they not being answer'd as she seemed to wish she went with the rest but with slower feet and had hardly left the parlour when the lady enter'd it by the other door a melancholy dignity in her person and air  She sat down Pray Mr Tomlinson be seated He took his chair over against her I stoo  beh  hers that I might give him  agreedupon  signals should there be occasion for them  As thus A wink of the lefteye was to signify  Push that point Captain  A wink of the right and a nod was to indicate  Approbation  of what he had said  My forefinger held up and biting my lip  Get off of that as fast as possible  A rightforward nod and a frown  Swear to it Captain  My whole spread hand  To take care not to say too much on that particular subject  And these motions I could make even those with my hand without holding up my arm or moving my wrist had the women been there as when they were agreed upon I knew not but they would  A scouling brow and a positive nod was to bid him  rise in his temper  She hemm'dI was going to speak to spare her supposed confusion But this lady never wants presence of mind when presence of mind is necessary either to her honour or to that conscious dignity which distinguishes her from all the women I ever knew  I have been considering said she as well as I was able of every thing that has passed and of all that has been said and of my unhappy situation I mean no ill I wish no ill to any creature living Mr Tomlinson I have always delighted to draw favourable rather than unfavourable conclusions sometimes as it has proved for very bad hearts Censoriousness whatever faults I have is not  naturally  my faultBut circumstanced as I am treated as I have been unworthily treated by a man who is full of contrivances and glories in them  Lovel  My dearest lifeBut I will not interrupt you  Cl  Thus treated it becomes me to doubt It concerns my honour to doubt to fear to apprehend  Your  intervention Sir is so seasonable so kind for  this man  My uncle's expedient the first of the kind he ever I believe thought of a plain honest goodminded man as he is not affecting such expedients Your report in conformity to it The consequences of that report The alarm taken by my brother His rash resolution upon itThe alarm taken by Lady Betty and the rest of Mr Lovelace's relationsThe  sudden  letters written to him upon it which with yours he shew'd meAll ceremony among persons  born observers of ceremony  and intitled to value themselves upon  their distinction  All these things have happen'd  so  quick and some of them  so  seasonable  Lovel  Lady Betty you see Madam in her letter dispenses with punctilio avowedly in compliment to you Charlotte in hers professes to do the same for the same reason Good Heaven that the respect intended you by my relations who in every other case are really punctilious should be thus construed They were glad Madam to have an opportunity to compliment you at my expence Every one of my family takes delight in raillying me But their joy on the supposed occasion  Cl  Do I doubt Sir that you have not something to say for anything you think fit to doI am speaking to Captain Tomlinson SirI wish you would be pleased to withdrawAt least to come from behind my chair  And she looked at the Captain observing no doubt that his eyes seemed to take lessons from mine  A fair match by Jupiter  The Captain was disconcerted The dog had not had such a blush upon his face for ten years before I bit my lip for vexation Walk'd about the room but nevertheless took my post again and blink'd  with my eyes to the Captain as a caution for him to take more care of  his  And then scouling with my brows and giving the nod positive I as good as said  Resent that Captain  Capt  I hope Madam you have no suspicion that I am capable  Cl  Be not displeased with me Captain Tomlinson I have told you that I am not of a suspicious temper Excuse me for the sake of my sincerity There is not I will be bold to say a sincerer heart in the world than hers before you  She took out her handkerchief and put it to her eyes  I was going at the instant after her example to vouch for the honesty of  my  heart but my conscience  Mennell'd  upon me and would not suffer the meditated vow to pass my lipsA devilish thing thought I for a man to be so little himself when he has most occasion for himself  The villain Tomlinson look'd at me with a rueful face as if he begg'd leave to cry for company It might have been as well if he  had  cried A feeling heart or the tokens of it given by a sensible eye are very reputable things when kept in countenance by the occasion  And here let me fairly own to thee that twenty times in this trying conversation I said to myself that could I have thought that I should have all this trouble and incurr'd all this guilt I would have been honest at first But why question'd I is this dear creature so lovelyYet so invincibleEver heardst thou before that the sweets of May blossom'd in December  Capt  Be pleased be pleased Madamif you have doubts of my honour  A whining varlet He should have been quite angryFor what gave I him the nod positive He  should have stalk'd to the window as for his whip and hat  Cl  I am only making such observations as my youth my inexperience and my present unhappy circumstances suggest to meA worthy heart such I hope is Captain Tomlinson's need not fear an examinationneed not fear being looked into Whatever doubt  that  man who has been the cause of my errors and as my severe father imprecated the punisher of the errors he has caused might have had of me or of my honour I would have forgiven him for them if he had fairly proposed them to me For he might perhaps have had some doubt of the future conduct of a creature whom he could induce to correspond with him against parental prohibition and against the lights which her own judgment threw in upon her And if he had propounded them to me like a man and a gentleman I would have been glad of the opportunity given me to clear my intentions and to have shewn myself intitled to his good opinion And I hope  you  Sir  Capt  I am ready to hear all your doubts Madam and to clear them up  Cl  I can only put it Sir to your conscience and honour  The dog sat uneasy He shifted his feet Her eye was upon him he was therefore after the rebuff he had met with afraid to look at me for my motions and now turn'd his eyes towards me then from me as if he would  unlook  his own looks his head turning about like a weathercock in a hurricane  Cl  That all is true that you have written and that you have told me  I gave him a rightforward nod and a frownas much as to say  Swear to it Captain  But the varlet did not round it off as I would have had him However he averr'd that it was  He had hoped he said that the circumstances with which his commission was attended and what he had communicated to her which he could not know but from his dear friend her uncle might have shielded him even from the  shadow  of suspicionBut I am contented said he stammering to be thoughtto be thoughtwhatwhat you please to think me till till you are satisfied  A whore'sbird  Cl  The circumstances you refer to I must own ought to shield you Sir from suspicionBut the man before you is a man that would make an angel suspected should that angel plead for him  I came forward Travers'd the roomWas indeed in a bloody passionI have no patience Madam And again I bit my unpersuasive lip  Cl  No man ought to be impatient at imputations he is not asham'd to deserve An innocent man  will not  be outrageous upon such imputations A guilty man  ought not  Most excellently would this charming creature cap sentences with Lord M  But I am not now trying you Sir on the foot of your  merits  I am only sorry that I am constrained to put questions to this  worthier  gentleman which perhaps I ought not to put so far as they regard  himself  And I hope Captain Tomlinson that you who know not Mr Lovelace so well as to my unhappiness I do and who have children of your own will excuse a poor young creature who is deprived of all worthy protection and who has been insulted and endangered by the most  designing man in the world  and perhaps  by a confederacy of his creatures  There she stopt and stood up and looked at me fear nevertheless apparently mingled with her anger And so it ought I was glad however of this  poor sign of loveNo one fears whom they value not  Womens tongues were licensed I was going to sayBut my conscience would not let me call her a  woman  nor use to her so vulgar a phrase I could only rave by my motions lift up my eyes spread my hands rub my face pull my wig and look like a fool Indeed I had a great mind to run mad Had I been alone with her I would and she should have taken consequences  The Captain interposed in my behalf gently however and as a man not quite sure that he was himself acquitted Some of the pleas we had both insisted on he again inforcedAnd speaking low Poor gentleman said he who can but pity him Indeed Madam it is easy to see with all his failings the power you have over him  Cl  I have no pleasure Sir in distressing any one Not even  him  who has so much distressed meBut Sir when I THINK and when I see him before me I cannot command my temper Indeed indeed Captain Tomlinson Mr Lovelace has not acted by me either as a grateful a generous or a prudent manHe knows not as I told him yesterday the value of the heart he has insulted  There the angel stopt her handkerchief at her eyes  O Belford Belford that she should so greatly excel as to make me at times a villain in my own eyes  I besought her pardon I promised that it should be the study of my whole life to deserve it My faults I said  whatever  they had been were rather faults in her  apprehension  than in  fact  I besought her to give way to the expedient I had hit uponI repeated it The Captain inforced it for her uncle's sake I once more for the sake of the general reconciliation  for the sake of all my family for the sake of preventing future mischief  She weptShe seemed stagger'd in her resolution She turned from me I mention'd the letter of Lord M I besought her to resign to Lady Betty's mediation all our differences if she would not forgive me before she saw her  She turned towards meShe was going to speak but her heart was fullAnd again she turned away her faceThen half turning it to me her handkerchief at her eyesAnd do you  really  and  indeed  expect Lady Betty and Miss MontagueAnd do you Again she stopt  I answer'd in a solemn manner  She turned from me her whole face and paused and seemed to consider But in a passionate accent again turning towards me O how difficult Jack for a Harlowe spirit to forgiveLet her Ladyship come if she pleases said sheI cannot cannot wish to  see  herAnd if she plead for you I cannot wish to  hear  herThe more I  think  the less can I forgive an attempt that I am convinced was intended to  destroy  me A plaguy strong word for the occasion supposing she was right What has my conduct been that an insult of  such  a nature should be offer'd to me as it would be a  weakness  to forgive I am sunk in my own eyesAnd how can I receive a visit that must depress me more  The Captain urged her in my favour with greater earnestness than before We both even clamour'd as I may say for mercy and forgiveness Didst thou never hear the good folks talk of taking heaven by stormContrition repeatedly avowed A total reformation promisedThe happy expedient again pleaded  Cl  I have taken my measures I have gone too far to recede or to  wish  to recede My mind is prepared  for adversity That I have not  deserved  the evils I have met with is my consolationI have written to Miss Howe what my intentions are My heart is not  with  youIt is  against  you Mr Lovelace I had not written to you as I did in the letter I left behind me had I not resolved whatever became of me to renounce you for ever  I was full of hope now Severe as her expressions were I saw she was afraid that I should think of what she had written And indeed her letter is violence itself  Angry people Jack should never write while their passion holds  Lovel  The severity you have shewn me Madam whether by pen or by speech shall never have place in my remembrance but for your  honour  In the light you have taken things all is deserved and but the natural result of virtuous resentment and I adore you even for the pangs you have given me  She was silent She had employment enough with her handherchief at her eyes  Lovel  You lament sometimes that you have no friends of your own sex to consult with Miss Rawlins I must confess is too inquisitive to be confided in  I lik'd not thou mayest think her appeal to Miss Rawlins  She  may  mean well But I never in my life knew a person who was fond of prying into the secrets of others that was fit to be trusted The curiosity of such is govern'd by pride which is not gratified but by whispering about a secret till it becomes public in order to shew either their consequence or their sagacity It is so in every case What man or woman who is  covetous  of  power  or of  wealth  is covetous of either for the sake of making a right use of itBut in the ladies of my family you  may  confide It is their ambition to think of you as one of themselves Renew but your consent to pass  to the world  for the sake of your uncle's  expedient and for the prevention of mischief as a lady some time married Lady Betty may be acquainted with the naked truth and you may as she hopes you will accompany her to her seat and if it  must  be so consider me as in a state of penitence or probation to be accepted or rejected as I may appear to deserve  The Captain again clapt his hand on his breast and declared upon his honour that this was a proposal that were the case that of his own daughter and she were not resolved upon  immediate  marriage which yet he thought by far the more eligible choice he should be very much concerned were she to refuse it  Cl  Were I with Mr Lovelace's relations and to pass as his wife to the world I could not have any choice And how could he be then in a state of probation O Mr Tomlinson you are too much his  friend  to see into his drift  Capt  His  friend Madam as I said before as I am  yours  and your  uncle's  for the sake of a general reconciliation which must begin with a better understanding between yourselves  Lovel  Only my dearest life resolve to attend the arrival and visit of Lady Betty And permit her to arbitrate between us  Capt  There can be no harm in  that  Madam You can suffer no inconvenience from  that  If Mr Lovelace's offence be such that a lady of that lady's character judges it to be unpardonable why then  Cl  interrupting and to me  If am not invaded by you SirIf I am as I ought to be my own mistress I think to stay here in this  honest hou  e  And then had I an  eyebeam  as the Captain calls it flash'd at me  till I receive a letter from Miss Howe That I hope will be in a day or two If in that time the ladies come whom you expect and if they are  desirous to see the creature whom you have made unhappy I shall know whether I can or cannot receive their visit  She turn'd short to the door and retiring went up stairs to her chamber  O Sir said the Captain as soon as she was gone what an angel of a woman is thisI  have been  and I  am  a very wicked manBut if any thing should happen amiss to this admirable lady thro' my means I shall have more cause for selfreproach than for all the bad actions of my life put together  And his eyes glisten'd  Nothing can happen amiss thou sorrowful dog What  can  happen amissAre we to form our opinion of things by the romantic notions of a girl who supposes  that  to be the greatest which is the slightest of evils Have I not told thee our whole story Has she not broken her promise Did I not generously spare her when in my power I was decent tho' I had her at such advantage Greater liberties have I taken with girls of character at a common rompingbout and all has been laugh'd off and handkerchief and headcloaths adjusted and petticoats shaken to rights in my presence Never man in the like circumstances and resolved as I was resolved goaded on as I was goaded on as well by her own sex as by the impulses of a violent passion was ever so decent Yet what mercy does she shew me  Now Jack this pitiful dog was such another unfortunate one as thyselfHis arguments serving to confirm me in the very purpose he brought them to prevail upon me to give up Had he left me to myself to the tenderness of my own nature moved as I was when the lady withdrew and had sat down and made odious faces and said nothing it is very possible that I should have taken the chair overagainst him which she had quitted and have cry'd  and blubber'd with him for half an hour together But the varlet to  argue  with me To pretend to  convince  a man who knows in his heart that he is doing a wrong thingHe must needs think that this would put me upon trying what I could say for myself and when the excited compunction can be carried from the heart to the lips it must evaporate in words  Thou perhaps in this place wouldst have urged the same pleas that he urged What I answer'd to him therefore may do for thee and spare thee the trouble of writing and me of reading a good deal of nonsense  Capt  You was pleased to tell me Sir that you only proposed to try her virtue and that you believed you should actually marry her  Lovel  So I shall and cannot help it I have no doubt but I shall And as to  trying  her is she not now in the height of her trial Have I not reason to think that she is coming about Is she not now yielding up her resentment for an attempt which she thinks she ought  not  to forgiveAnd if she do may she not forgive the  last attempt  Can she in a word resent  that  more than she does  this  Women often for their own sakes will keep the  last secret  but will ostentatiously din the ears of gods and men with their clamours upon a successless offer It was my folly my weakness that I gave her not more cause for this her unsparing violence  Capt  O Sir you never will be able to subdue this lady without force  Lovel  Well then puppy must I not endeavour to find a proper time and place  Capt  Forgive me Sir But can you think of force to such a fine creature  Lovel  Force indeed I abhor the thought of and for what thinkest thou have I taken all the pains  I have taken and engaged so many persons in my cause but to avoid the necessity of  violent  compulsion But yet imaginest thou that I expect  direct consent  from such a lover of forms as this lady is known to be Let me tell thee M  c  Donald that thy master Belford has urged on thy side of the question all that thou canst urge Must I have every puppy's conscience to pacify as well as my ownBy my soul Patrick she has a friend  here  clapping my hand on my breast  that pleads for her with greater and more irresistable eloquence than all the men in the world can plead for her And had she not escaped meAnd yet how have I answer'd my first design of trying her  Vol  iii  Letter  xvii  p    s  q  and in  her  the virtue of the most virtuous of the sex Thou puppy Wouldst thou have me decline a trial that may make for the honour of a sex we all so dearly love  Then Sir you have no thoughtsno thoughtslooking still more sorrowfully of marrying this wonderful lady  Yes puppy but I have But let me first to gratify  my  pride bring down  hers  Let me see that she loves me well enough to forgive me for my  own  sake Has she not heretofore lamented that she staid not in her father's house tho' the consequence must have been if she  had  that she would have been the wife of the odious Solmes If now she be brought to consent to be mine seest thou not that the  reconciliation  with her  detested relations  is the  inducement  as it  always  was and not  love  of  me  Neither her virtue nor her love can be established but upon full trial the  last  trialBut if her resistance and resentment be such as hitherto I have reason to expect they will be and if I find in that resentment less of hatred of  me  than of the  fact  then shall she be mine in her own way Then hateful as is the  life of shackles  to me will I  marry her  Well Sir I can only say that I am dough in your hands to be moulded into what shape you please But if as I said before  None of your  saidsbefore  I remember all thou saidst And I know all thou canst  further  say Thou art only Pontius Pilate like washing thine own hands don't I know thee that thou mayst have something to silence thy conscience with by loading me But we have gone too far to recede Are not all our engines in readinessDry up thy sorrowful eyes Let unconcern and heart'sease once more take possession of thy solemn features Thou hast hitherto performed extremely well Shame not thy past by thy future behaviour and a rich reward awaits thee If thou  art  dough  be  dough and I slapt him on the shoulder Resume but thy former shapeAnd I'll be answerable for the event  He bow'd assent and compliance Went to the glass and began to untwist and unsadden his features Pull'd his wig right as if that as well as his head and heart had been discomposed by his compunction and once more became old Mulciber's and mine  But didst thou think Jack that there was so muchWhatshallIcall itin this Tomlinson Didst thou imagine that such a fellow as that had bowels That nature so long dead and buried in him as to all humane effects should thus revive and exert itselfYet why do I ask this question of thee who to my equal surprize hast shewn on the same occasion the like compassionate sensibilities  As to Tomlinson it looks as if poverty had made him the wicked fellow he is as plenty and wantonness have made us what we are Necessity after all is the test of principle But what is there in this dull word or thing called HONESTY that even I who cannot in my present views be served by it cannot  help thinking even the accidental emanations of it amiable in Tomlinson tho' demonstrated in a  female case  and judging better of him for being capable of such  LETTER XIV  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  THIS debate between the Captain and me was hardly over when the three women led by Miss Rawlins enter'd hoping No intrusionBut very desirous the maiden said to know if we were likely to accommodate  O yes I hope so You know ladies that your Sex must in these cases preserve their forms They must be courted to comply with their own happiness A lucky expedient we have hit upon The uncle has his doubts of our marriage He cannot believe nor will anybody that it is possible that a man so much in love the lady so desirable  They all took the hintIt was a very extraordinary case the two widows allowed Women Jack as I believe I have observed elsewhere have a high opinion of what they can do for usMiss Rawlins desired if I pleased to let them know the expedient and look'd as if there was no need to proceed in the rest of my speech  I begg'd that they would not let the lady know that I had told them what this expedient was  They promised  It was this That to oblige and satisfy Mr Harlowe the ceremony was to be again performed He was to be privately present and to give his niece to me with his own handsAnd she was retired to consider of it  Thou seest Jack that I have provided an excuse to save my veracity to the women here in case I  should incline to marriage and she should choose to have Miss Rawlins's assistance at the ceremony Nor doubted I to bring my Fairone to save my credit on this occasion if I could get her to consent to be mine  A charming expedient cried the widow They were all three ready to clap their hands for joy upon it Women love to be married twice at least Jack tho' not indeed to the  same man  and all bless'd the reconciliatory scheme and the proposer of it and supposing it came from the Captain they look'd at him with pleasure while his face shined with the applause implied He should think himself very happy if he could bring about a general reconciliation and he flourish'd with his head like my man Will on his victory over old Grimes bridling by turns like Miss Rawlins in the height of a prudish fit  But now it was time for the Captain to think of returning to town having a great deal of business to dispatch before morning Nor was he certain that he should again be able to attend us at Hamstead before he went home  And yet I did not intend that he should leave Hampstead this night Every thing drawing on to a crisis  A message to the above effect was carried up at my desire by Mrs Moore with the Captain's compliments and to know if she had any commands for him to her uncle  But I hinted to the women that it would be proper for them to withdraw if the lady did come down lest she should not care to be so free before  them  on a proposal so particular as she would be to  us  who had offer'd it to her consideration  Mrs Moore brought down word that the lady was following her They all three withdrew and she enter'd at one door as they went out at the other  The Captain accosted her repeating the contents of the message sent up and desired that she would give him her commands in relation to the report he was to make to her uncle Harlowe  I know not what to say Sir nor what I would have  you  to say to my uncle Perhaps you may have business in townPerhaps you need not see my uncle till I have heard from Miss Howe till after Lady BettyI don't know what to say  I implored the return of that value which she had so generously acknowleged once to have had for me I presumed I said to flatter myself that Lady Betty in her own person and in the name of all my family would be able on my promised reformation and contrition to prevail in my favour especially as our prospects in other respects with regard to the general reconciliation wished for were so happy But let me owe to your own generosity my dearest creature said I rather than to the mediation of any person on earth the forgiveness I am an humble suitor for How much more agreeable to yourself O best beloved of my soul must it be as well as obliging to me that your first personal knowlege of my relations and theirs of you for they will not be denied attending you should not be begun in recriminations and appeals As Lady Betty will be here so soon it will not perhaps be possible for you to receive her visit with a brow absolutely serene But dearest dearest creature I beseech you let the misunderstanding pass as a slight oneAs a misunderstanding clear'd up Appeals give pride and superiority to the persons appealed to and are apt to lessen the appellant not only in their eye but in her own Exalt not into judges those who are prepared to take lessons and instructions from you The individuals of my family are as proud as I am said to be But they will chearfully resign to your superiorityYou  will be the first woman of the family in every one's eyes  This might have done with any other woman in the world but  this  and yet she is the only woman in the world of whom it may with truth be said But thus angrily did she disclaim the compliment  Yes indeedand there she stopt a moment her sweet bosom heaving with a noble disdainTrick'd out of myself from the very firstA fugitive from my own family Renounced by my relations Insulted by youLaying humble claim to the protection of yoursIs not this the light in which I must appear not only to the ladies of your family but to all the worldThink you Sir that in these circumstances or even had I been in the  happiest  that I could be affected by this plea of undeserved superiorityYou are a stranger to the mind of Clarissa Harlowe if you think her capable of so poor and so  undue  a pride  She went from us to the farther end of the room  The Captain was again affectedExcellent creature I called her and reverently approaching her urged further the plea I had last made  It is but lately said I that the opinions of my relations have been more than indifferent to me whether good or bad and it is for  your  sake more than for  my own  that I now wish to stand well with my whole family The principal motive of Lady Betty's coming up is to purchase presents for the whole family to make on the happy occasion  This consideration turning to the Captain with so nobleminded a dear creature I know can have no weight only as it will shew their value and respect But what a damp would their worthy hearts receive were they to find their admired new niece as they now think her not only  not  their niece but capable of renouncing me for ever They love me  They  all  love me I have been guilty of carelessness and levity to them indeed but of carelessness and levity only and  that  owing to a pride that has set me above meanness tho' it has not done every thing for me  My whole family will be guaranties for my good behaviour to this dear creature their niece their daughter their cousin their friend their chosen companion and directress all in oneUpon my soul Captain we  may  we  must  be happy  But dearest dearest creature let me on my knees and down I dropt her face all the time turn'd half from me as she stood at the window her handkerchief often at her eyes plead your  promised  forgiveness and let us not appear to them on their visit thus unhappy with each other Lady Betty the next hour that she sees you will write her opinion of you and of the likelihood of our future happiness to Lady Sarah her sister a weakspirited woman who now hopes to supply to herself in my bride the lost daughter she still mourns for  The Captain then joined in reurging her uncle's hopes and expectations and his resolution effectually to set about the general reconciliation The mischief that might be prevented The certainty he was in that her uncle might be prevailed upon to give her to me with his own hand if she made it her choice to wait for his coming up But for his own part he humbly advised and fervently pressed her to make the very next day or Monday at farthest my happy day  Permit me dearest Lady said he and I could kneel to you myself bending his knee tho' I have no interest in my earnestness but the pleasure I should have to be able to serve you all to beseech you to give me an opportunity to assure your uncle that I myself saw with my own eyes the happy knot ty'dAll misunderstandings all doubts all diffidences will then be at an end  And what Madam rejoined I still kneeling can there be in your new measures be they what they will that can so happily so reputably I will presume to say for all round obviate the present difficulties  Miss Howe herself if she loves you and loves your fame Madam urged the Captain his knee still bent must congratulate you on such a happy conclusion  Then turning her face she saw the Captain halfkneelingO Sir O Capt TomlinsonWhy this  undue  condescension extending her hand to his elbow to raise himI cannot bear thisThen casting her eye to me Rise Mr Lovelace Kneel not to the poor creature whom you have insultedHow cruel the occasion for itAnd how mean the submission  Not mean to such an angelNor can I rise but to be forgiven  The Captain then reurged once more the day He was amazed he said if she ever valued me  O Captain Tomlinson interrupted she how much are you the friend of this man  If I had never valued him he never would have had it in his power to insult me  nor could I have  taken to heart as I do  the insult execrable as it was so undeservedly so ungratefully givenBut let him retireFor a moment let him retire  I was more than half afraid to trust the Captain by himself with herHe gave me a sign that I might depend upon himAnd then I took out of my pocket his letter to me and Lady Betty's and Miss Montague's and Lord M's which last she had not then seen and giving them to him Procure for me in the first place Mr Tomlinson a reperusal of these three letters and of  This  from Lord M And I beseech you my dearest life give them due  consideration And let me on my return find the happy effects of it  I then withdrew with slow feet however and a misgiving heart  The Captain insisted upon this reperusal previously to what she had to say to him as he tells me She comply'd but with some difficulty as if she was  afraid  of being  soften'd in my favour  She lamented her unhappy situation destitute of friends and not knowing whither to go or what to doShe asked questions  sifting  questions about her uncle about her family and after what he knew of Mr Hickman's fruitless application in her favour  He was well prepared in this particular for I had shewn him the letters and extracts of letters of Miss Howe which I had so happily come at  Vol  iv  p  seq  Might she be assured she asked him that her brother with Singleton and Solmes were actually in quest of her  He averr'd that they were  She asked If he thought I had hopes of prevailing on her to go back to town  He was sure I had not  Was he really of opinion that Lady Betty would pay her a visit  He had no doubt of it  But Sir but Captain TomlinsonThen impatiently turning from him and again to him I know not what to doBut were I  your  daughter Sir Were  you  my own fatherAlas Sir I have neither father nor mother  He turned from her and wiped his eyes  O Sir you have humanity She wept too There are some men in the world thank Heaven that  can  be moved O Sir I have met with hardhearted men and in my own family tooor I could not  have been so unhappy as I amBut I make everybody unhappy  I suppose his eyes run over  Dearest Madam Heavenly LadyWho can who canhesitated and blubber'd the dog as he owned And indeed I heard some part of what passed tho'  they both  talked lower than I wished for from the nature of  their  conversation there was no room for altitudes  THEM and BOTH and THEYHow it goes against me to include this angel of a creature and any man on earth but myself in  one  word  Capt  Who can forbear being affectedBut Madam you  can  be no other man's  Cl  Nor would I be But he is so sunk with me To fire the houseAn artifice so vilecontrived for the worst of purposesWould you have a daughter of yoursBut what would I sayYet you see that I have nobody in whom I can confideMr Lovelace is a vindictive manHe could not love the creature whom he could insult as he has insulted me Then pausingIn short I never never can forgive  him  nor he  me  Do you think Sir I would have gone so far as I have gone if I had intended ever to draw with him in one yokeI left behind me  such  a letter  You know Madam he has acknowleged the justice of your resentment  O Sir he can acknowlege and he can retract fifty times a dayBut do not think I am trifling with myself and you and want to be  persuaded  to forgive him and to be  his  There is not a creature of my sex who would have been  more explicit  and  more frank  than I would have been from the moment I  intended  to be his had I had a heart like  my own  to deal with I was always  above reserve  Sir I will presume to say where I had no cause of doubt Mr Lovelace's conduct has made me appear perhaps  overnice  when my heart wanted to be  encouraged  and  assured  and when if it had been so my whole behaviour would have been governed by it  She stopt her handkerchief at her eyes I inquired after the minutest part of her behaviour as well as after her words I love thou knowest to trace human nature and more particularly female nature thro' its most secret recesses  The pitiful fellow was lost in silent admiration of herAnd thus the noble creature proceeded  It is the fate of unequal unions that tolerable creatures thro' them frequently incurr censure when more happily yoked they might be intitled to praise And shall I not shun an union with a man that might lead into errors a creature who flatters herself that she is blest with an inclination to be good and who wishes to make everyone happy with whom she has any connexion even to her very servants  She paused taking a turn about the roomthe fellow devil fetch him a mummy all the time Then proceeded  Formerly indeed I hoped to be an humble means of reforming him But when I have  no such hope  is it right You are a serious man Sir to make a venture that shall endanger  my own morals  Still silent was the varlet If my advocate had nothing to say for me what hope of carrying my cause  And now Sir what is the result of allIt is thisThat you will endeavour if you have that influence over him which a man of your sense and experience ought to have to prevail upon him and that for  his own  sake as well as  mine  to leave me free to pursue my own destiny And of this you may assure him that I never will be any other man's  Impossible MadamI know that Mr Lovelace would not hear me with patience on such a topic And I do assure you that I have some spirit and  should not care to take an indignity from him or from any man living  She pausedThen resumingAnd think you Sir that my uncle will refuse to receive a letter from me  How averse Jack to concede a tittle in my favour  I know Madam as matters are circumstanced that he would not  answer  it If you please I will carry one down from you  And will he not pursue his intentions in  my  favour nor be himself reconciled to me except I am married  From what your brother gives out and affects to believe on Mr Lovelace's living with you in the same  No more SirI am an unhappy creature  He then reurged that it would be in her power instantly or on the morrow to put an end to all her difficulties  How can that  be  said she The licence  still  to be obtained The settlements  still  to be signed Miss Howe's answer to my last  unreceived  And shall I Sir be in such a HURRY as if I thought my  honour in danger if I delay'd  Yet  marry  the man from whom only it  can  be endanger'dUnhappy thrice unhappy Clarissa HarloweIn how many difficulties has one rash step involved theeAnd she turn'd from him and wept  The varlet by way of comfort wept too Yet her tears as he might have observed were tears that indicated rather a  yielding  than a  perverse  temper  There is a sort of stone thou knowest so soft in the quarry that it may in a manner be cut with a knife but if the opportunity be not taken and it is exposed to the air for any time it will become as hard as marble and then with difficulty it yields to the chizel  The nature of the  Bath  stone in particular  So this lady not taken at the moment  after a turn or two cross the room gained more resolution and then she declared as she had done once before that she would wait the issue of Miss Howe's answer to the letter she had sent her from hence and take her measures accordingly leaving it to him mean time to make what report he thought fit to her uncle the kindest that  truth  could bear she doubted not from Captain Tomlinson And she should be glad of a few lines from him to hear what  that  was  She wished him a good journey She complained of her head and was about to withdraw But I stept round to the door next the stairs as if I had but just come in from the garden which as I entered I called a very pretty one and took her reluctant hand as she was going out My dearest life you are not goingWhat hopes CaptainHave you not some hopes to give me of pardon and reconciliation  She said She would not be detained But I would not let her go till she had promised to return when the Captain had reported to me what her resolution was  And when he had I claimed her promise and she came down again and repeated it as what she was determined upon  I expostulated with her upon it in the most submissive and earnest manner She made it necessary for me to repeat many of the pleas I had before urged The Captain seconded me with equal earnestness At last each fell down on his knees before her  She was distressed I was afraid at one time she would have fainted Yet neither of us would rise without some concessions I pleaded my own sake the Captain his dear friend her uncle's and  both  the prevention of future mischief and the peace and happiness of the two families  She own'd herself unequal to the conflict She sigh'd she sobb'd she wept she wrung her hands  I was perfectly eloquent in my vows and protestations Her tearful eyes were cast down upon me a glow upon each charming cheek a visible anguish in every lovely featureAt last her trembling knees seeming to fail her she dropt into the next chair her charming face as if seeking for a hidingplace which a mother's bosom would have best supply'd sinking upon her own shoulder  I forgot at the instant all my vows of revenge I threw myself at her feet as she sat and snatching her hand pressed it with my lips I besought Heaven to forgive my past offences and prosper my future hopes as I designed honourably and justly by the charmer of my heart if once more she would restore me to her favour And I thought I felt drops of scalding water Could they be tears trickle down upon my cheeks while my cheeks glowing like fire seemed to scorch up the unwelcome strangers  I then arose not doubting of an imply'd pardon in this silent distress I raised the Captain I whisper'd himBy my soul man I am in earnestNow talk of reconciliation of her uncle of the licence of settlementsAnd raising my voice If now at last Captain Tomlinson my angel will give me leave to call so great a blessing mine it will be impossible that you should say too much to her uncle in praise of my gratitude my affection and fidelity to his charming niece and he may begin as soon as he pleases his kind schemes for effecting the desirable reconciliationNor shall he prescribe any terms to me that I will not comply with  The Captain bless'd me with his eyes and hands Thank God whisper'd he We approached the lady together  What hinders dearest Madam said he what now hinders but that Lady Betty Lawrance when she comes may be acquainted with the truth of everything And assist privately at your nuptialsI will  stay till they are celebrated and then shall I go down with the happy tidings to my dear Mr HarloweAnd all will all must soon be happy  I must have an answer from Miss Howe reply'd the still trembling Fairone I cannot change my new measures but with her advice I will forfeit all my hopes of happiness in this world rather than her good opinion and that she should think me giddy unsteady or precipitate All I will further say on the present subject is this That when I have her answer to what I  have  written I will write to her the whole state of the matter as I shall then be enabled to do  Lovel  Then must I despair for everO Captain Tomlinson Miss Howe hates meMiss Howe  Capt  Not so perhapsWhen Miss Howe knows your concern for having offended she will never advise that with such prospects of general reconciliation the hopes of so many considerable persons in both families should be frustrated Some little time as that excellent lady has foreseen and hinted will necessarily be taken up in actually procuring the licence and in perusing and signing the settlements In that time Miss Howe's answer may be received and Lady Betty may arrive and she no doubt will have weight to dissipate the lady's doubts and to accelerate the day It shall be my part mean time to make Mr Harlowe easy All I fear from delay is from Mr James Harlowe's quarter and therefore all must be conducted with prudence and privacyAs your uncle Madam has proposed  She was silent I rejoiced in her silence The dear creature thought I has actually forgiven me in her heartBut why will she not lay me under obligation to her by the generosity of an explicit declarationAnd yet as that would not accelerate anything while the licence is not in my hands she is the less to be blamed if I do her justice that she took more time to  descend  I proposed as on the morrow night to go to town and doubted not to bring the licence up with me on Monday morning Would she be pleased to assure me that she would not depart from Mrs Moore's  She should stay at Mrs Moore's till she had an answer from Miss Howe  I told her that I hop'd I might have her  tacit  consent at least to the obtaining of the licence  I saw by the turn of her countenance that I should not have asked this question She was so far from  tacitly  consenting that she declared to the contrary  As I never intended I said to ask her to enter again into a house with the people of which she was so much offended would she be pleased to give orders for her cloaths to be brought up hither Or should Dorcas attend her for any of her commands on that head  She desired not ever more to see anybody belonging to that house She might perhaps get Mrs Moore or Mrs Bevis to go thither for her and take her keys with them  I doubted not I said that Lady Betty would arrive by that time I hoped she had no objection to my bringing that lady and my cousin Montague up with me  She was silent  To be sure Mr Lovelace said the Captain the lady can have no objection to this  She was still silent So silence in this case was assent  Would she be pleased to write to Miss Howe  Sir Sir peevishly interruptingNo more questions No prescribing to meYou will do as you think fit So will I as I please I own no obligation to you Captain Tomlinson your servant Recommend me to my uncle Harlowe's favour And was going  I took her reluctant hand and besought her only to promise to meet me early in the morning  To what purpose meet you Have you more to say than has been saidI have had enough of vows and protestations Mr Lovelace To what purpose should I meet you tomorrow morning  I repeated my request and that in the most fervent manner naming six in the morning  You know that I am always stirring before that hour at this season of the year  was the halfexpressed consent  She then again recommended herself to her uncle's favour and withdrew  And thus Belford has she  mended her markets  as Lord M would say and I worsted mine Miss Howe's next letter is now the hinge on which the fate of both must turn I shall be absolutely ruin'd and undone if I cannot intercept it  LETTER XV  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Sat Midnight  NO rest  says a text that I once heard preached upon  to the wicked  And I cannot close my eyes yet wanted only to compound for half an hour in an elbowchair So must scribble on  I parted with the Captain after another strong debate with him in relation to what is to be the fate of this lady As the fellow has an excellent head and would have made an eminent figure in any station of life had not his early days been tainted with a deep crime and he detected in it and as he had the right side of the argument I had a good deal of difficulty with him and at last brought myself to promise that if I could prevail upon her generously to forgive me and to reinstate me in her favour I would make it my whole endeavour to get off of my  contrivances as happily as I could only that Lady Betty and Charlotte must come and then substituting him for her uncle's proxy take shame to myself and marry  But if I should Jack with the strongest antipathy to the state that ever man had what a figure shall I make in rakish annals And can I have taken all this pains for nothing Or for a wife only that however excellent and  any  woman do I think I could make good because I could make any woman  fear  as well as  love  me might have been obtained without the plague I have been at and much more reputably than with it And hast thou not seen that this haughty lady knows not how to forgive with graciousness Indeed has not at all forgiven me But holds my soul in a  suspense  which has been so grievous to her own  At this silent moment I think that if I were to pursue my former scheme and resolve to try whether I cannot make a greater fault serve as a sponge to wipe out a less and then be forgiven for that I can justify myself to  myself  and that as the fair Implacable would say is all in all  It is my intention in all my reflections to avoid repeating at least dwelling upon what I have before written to thee tho' the state of the case may not have varied so I would have thee reconsider the  old  reasonings particularly those contained in my answer to thy last expostulatory nonsense  See Vol  iv  p    seq  and add the  new  as they fall from my pen and then I shall think myself invincibleat least as arguing rake to rake  I take the gaining of this lady to be essential to my happiness And is it not natural for  all men  to aim at obtaining whatever they think will make them happy be the object more or less considerable in the eyes of others  As to the manner of endeavouring to obtain her  by falsification of oaths vows and the likeDo not the poets of two thousand years and upwards tell us that Jupiter laughs at the perjuries of lovers And let me add to what I have heretofore mentioned on that head a question or two  Do not the mothers the aunts the grandmothers the governesses of the pretty innocents always from their very cradles to riper years preach to them the deceitfulness of menThat they are not to regard their oaths vows promisesWhat a parcel of fibbers would all these reverend matrons be if there were not nowandthen a pretty credulous rogue taken in for a justification of their preachments and to serve as a beacon lighted up for the benefit of the rest  Do we not then see that an honest prowling fellow is a necessary evil on many accounts Do we not see that it is highly requisite that a sweet girl should be nowandthen drawn aside by himAnd the more eminent the lady in the graces of person mind and fortune is not the example likely to be the more efficacious  If these  postulata  be granted me who I pray can equal my charmer in all these Who therefore so fit for an example to the rest of the SexAt worst I am intirely within my worthy friend Mandeville's rule  That private vices are public benefits  Well then if this sweet creature must  fall  as it is called for the benefit of all the pretty fools of the Sex she  must  and there's an end of the matter And what would there have been in it of uncommon or rare had I not been so long about itAnd so I dismiss all further argumentation and debate upon the question And I impose upon thee when thou writest to me an eternal silence on this head  Wafer'd on as an afterwritten introduction to the paragraphs which follow  LORD Jack what shall I do nowHow one evil brings on anotherDreadful news to tell theeWhile I was meditating a simple robbery here have I in my own defence indeed been guilty of murder A bloody murderSo I believe it will proveAt her last gaspPoor impertinent opposer Eternally resistingEternally contradicting There she lies weltering in her blood Her death's wound have I given herBut she was a thief an impostor as well as a tormentor She had stolen my pen While I was sullenly meditating doubting as to my future measures she stole it and thus she wrote with it in a hand exactly like my own and would have faced me down that it was really my own handwriting  But let me reflect before it be too late On the manifold perfections of this everadmirable creature let me reflect The hand yet is only held up The blow is not struck Miss Howe's next letter may blow thee up In policy thou shouldest be now at least honest Thou canst not live without her Thou wouldest rather marry her than lose her absolutely Thou mayest undoubtedly prevail upon her inflexible as she seems to be for marriage But if now she find thee a villain thou mayest never more engage her attention and she perhaps will refuse and abhor thee  Yet already have I not gone too far Like a repentant thief afraid of his gang and obliged to go on in fear of hanging till he comes to be hang'd I am afraid of the gang of my cursed contrivances  As I hope to live I am sorry at the present writing that I have been such a foolish plotter as to put it as I fear I have done out of my  own  power  to be honest I hate compulsion in all forms and cannot bear even to be  compelled  to be the wretch my choice has made me So now Belford as thou hast said I am a machine at last and no free agent  Upon my soul Jack it is a very foolish thing for a man of spirit to have brought himself to such a height of iniquity that he must proceed and cannot help himself and yet to be nextto certain that his very victory will undo him  Why was such a woman as This thrown in my way whose very fall will be her glory and perhaps not only my shame but my destruction  What a happiness must that man know who moves regularly to some laudable end and has nothing to reproach himself with in his progress to it When by honest means he attains this end how great and unmixed must be his enjoyments What a happy man in this particular case had I been had it been given me to  be  only what I wished to  appear  to be  Thus far had my  Conscience  written with my pen and see what a recreant she had made meI seized her by the throat  ThereThere  said I thou vile impertinentTake  that  and  that  How often have I given thee warningAnd now I hope thou intruding varletess have I done thy business  Puling and  invoiced  rearing up thy detested head in vain implorest thou  my  mercy who in  thy  day hast shewed me so littleTake  that  for a risingblowAnd now will  thy  pain and  my  pain from  thee  soon be overLie thereWelter on Had I not given thee thy death's wound thou wouldest have robbed me of all my joys Thou couldest not have mended me 'tis plain Thou couldest only have thrown me into despair Didst thou not see that I had gone too far to recedeWelter on once more I bid theeGasp on  That  thy last  gasp surelyHow hard diest thouADIEU 'Tis kind in thee however to bid me  Adieu  Adieu Adieu Adieu to thee O thou inflexible and till now unconquerable bosomintruder Adieu to thee for ever  LETTER XVI  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Sunday Morn June    o' Clock  A Few words to the information thou sentest me last night concerning thy poor old man and then I rise from my seat shake myself refresh newdress and so to my charmer whom notwithstanding her reserves I hope to prevail upon to walk out with me on the heath this warm and fine morning  The birds must have awaken'd her before now They are in full song She always gloried in accustoming herself to behold the sunrise one of God's natural wonders as once she called it  Her window salutes the East The valleys must be gilded by his rays by the time I am with her for already have they made the uplands smile and the face of nature chearful  How unsuitable wilt thou find this gay preface to a subject so gloomy as that I am now turning to  I am glad to hear thy tedious expectations are at last answered  Thy servant tells me that thou art plaguily grieved at the old fellow's departure  I can't say but thou mayst look as if thou wert harassed as thou hast been for a number of days and nights with a close attendance upon a dying man beholding his drawingon hourPretending for decency's sake to whine over his excruciating pangs To be in the way to answer a thousand impertinent inquiries after the health of a man thou wishedst to die To pray by himfor so once thou wrotest to me  To read by himTo be forced to join in consultations with a parcel of solemn wou'dseemwise doctors and their officious Zanies the apothecaries joined with the butcherly tribe of scarificators all combined to carry on the physical farce and to cut out thongs both from his flesh and his estateTo have the superadded apprehension of dividing thy interest in what he shall leave with a crew of eagerhoping nevertobesatisfied relations legatees and the devil knows who of private gratificators of passions laudable and illaudableIn these circumstances I wonder not that thou lookest to servants as little grieved at heart as thyself and who are gaping after legacies as thou after  heirship  as if thou indeed wert grieved and as if the most wryfacing woe had befallen thee  Then as I have often thought the reflection that must naturally arise from such mortifying objects as the death of one with whom we have been familiar must afford when we are obliged to attend it in its slow approaches and in its facetwisting pangs that it will one day be our own case goes a great way to credit the appearance of grief  And This it is that seriously reflected upon may temporarily give a fine air of sincerity to the wailings of lively widows heartexulting heirs and residuary legatees of all denominations since by keeping down the inward joy those interesting reflections must sadden the aspect and add an appearance of real concern to the assumed sables  Well but now thou art come to the reward of all thy watchings anxieties and close attendances tell me what it is tell me if it compensate thy trouble and answer thy hope  As to myself thou seest by the gravity of my style how the subject has help'd to mortify me But the necessity I am under of committing either speedy matrimony or a rape has sadden'd over my gayer prospects and more than the case itself contributed  to make me sympathize with thy present joyfulsorrow  Adieu Jack I must be soon out of my pain and my Clarissa shall be soon out of hersFor so does the arduousness of the case require  LETTER XVII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Sunday Morning  I Have had the honour of my charmer's company for two complete hours We met before six in Mrs Moore's garden A walk on the heath refused me  The sedateness of her aspect and her kind compliance in this meeting gave me hopes And all that either the Captain or I had urged yesterday to obtain a full and free pardon that reurged I and I told her besides that Capt Tomlinson was gone down with hopes to prevail upon her uncle Harlowe to come up in person in order to present me with the greatest blessing that man ever received  But the utmost I could obtain was That she would take no resolution in my favour till she received Miss Howe's next letter  I will not repeat the arguments used by me But I will give thee the substance of what she said in answer to them  She had considered of every thing she told me My whole conduct was before her The house I carried her to must be a vile house The people early shewed what they were capable of in the earnest attempt made to fasten Miss Partington upon her as she doubted not with my approbation Surely thought I she has not received a duplicate of Miss Howe's letter of detection They heard her cries My insult was undoubtedly premeditated By my whole recollected behaviour to her previous to  it it must be so I had the vilest of views no question And my treatment of her put it out of all doubt  Soul all over Belford she seems sensible of liberties that my passion made me insensible of having taken  She besought me to give over all thoughts of her Sometimes she said she thought herself cruelly treated by her nearest and dearest relations At  such  times a spirit of repining and even of resentment took place and the reconciliation at other times so desirable was not then so much the favourite wish of her heart as was the scheme she had formerly plannedof taking her good Norton for her directress and guide and living upon her own estate in the manner her grandfather had intended she should live  This scheme she doubted not that her cousin Morden who was one of her trustees for that estate would enable her and that as she hoped without litigation to pursue And if he can and does what Sir let me ask you said she have I seen in your conduct that should make me prefer to it an union of interests where there is such a disunion in minds  So thou seest Jack there is  reason  as well as  resentment  in the preference she makes against me Thou seest that she presumes to think that she can be happy  without  me and that she must be unhappy  with  me  I had besought her in the conclusion of my reurged arguments to write to Miss Howe before Miss Howe's answer could come in order to lay before her the present state of things and if she  would  defere to her judgment to let her have an opportunity to give it on the full knowlege of the case  So I would Mr Lovelace was the answer if I were in doubt myself which I would prefer marriage or the scheme I have mentioned You cannot think Sir but the latter must be my choice I wish  to part with you with temperDon't put me upon repeating  Part with me  Madam interrupted II cannot bear those wordsBut let me beseech you however to write to Miss Howe I hope if Miss Howe is not my enemy  She is not the enemy of your  person  Siras you would be convinced if you  saw her last letter to me  The lady innocently means Mr Lovelace's forged one p    of this Volume  But were she not an enemy to your  actions  she would not be  my  friend nor the friend of  virtue  Why will you provoke from me Mr Lovelace the harshness of expression which however deserved by you I am unwilling just now to use having suffered enough in the two past days from my own vehemence  I bit my lip for vexation I was silent  Miss Howe proceeded she knows the full state of matters already Sir The answer I expect from her respects  myself  not  you  Her heart is too warm in the cause of friendship to leave me in suspense one moment longer than is necessary as to what I want to know Nor does her answer depend absolutely upon herself She must see a person first and that person perhaps must see others  The cursed smugglerwoman JackMiss Howe's Townsend I doubt notPlot contrivance intrigue stratagemUnderground moles these ladies But let the earth cover me let me be a mole too thought I if they carry their pointAnd if this lady escape me now  She frankly owned that she had once thought of embarking  out of all our ways  for some one of our American colonies But now that she had been  compelled  to see me which had been her greatest dread and which she would have given her life to avoid she thought she might be happiest in the resumption  of her former favourite scheme if Miss Howe could find her a reputable and private asylum till her cousin Morden could come But if he came not soon and if she had a difficulty to get to a place of refuge whether from her brother or from  anybody else  meaning me I suppose she might yet perhaps go abroad For to say the truth she could not think of returning to her father's house since her brother's rage her sister's upbraidings her father's anger her mother's still moreaffecting sorrowings and her own consciousness under them all would be insupportable to her  O Jack I am sick to death I pine I die for Miss Howe's next letter I would bind gag strip rob and do any thing but murder to intercept it  But determined as she seems to be it was evident to me nevertheless that she had still some tenderness for me  She often wept as she talk'd and much oftener sigh'd She looked at me twice with an eye of  undoubted  gentleness and three times with an eye  tending  to compassion and softness But its benign rays were as often  snatch'd  back as I may say and her face averted as if her sweet eye were not to be trusted and could not stand against my eager eyes seeking as they did for a lost heart in hers and endeavouring to penetrate to her very soul  More than once I took her hand She struggled not  much  against the freedom I pressed it once with my lips She was not  very  angry A frown indeed but a frown that had more distress in it than indignation  How came the dear soul cloathed as it is with such a silken vesture by all its steadiness  See Vol  i  p    for what she herself says on that steadiness which Mr Lovelace tho' a  deserved  sufferer by it cannot help admiring  Was it necessary that the active gloom of such a tyrant of a  father  should commix with such a passive sweetness  of a willless  mother  to produce a constancy an equanimity a steadiness in the  daughter  which never woman before could boast ofIf so she is more obliged to that despotic father than I could have imagined a creature to be who gave distinction to every one related to her beyond what the crown itself can confer  I hoped I said that she would admit of the intended visit of the two ladies which I had so often mentioned  She was  here  She  had  seen me She could not help herself at present She ever had the highest regard for the ladies of my family because of their worthy characters There she turned away her sweet face and vanquished a halfrisen sigh  I kneeled to her then It was upon a verdant cushion for we were upon the grasswalk I caught her hand I besought her with an earnestness that called up as I could feel my heart to my eyes to make me by her forgiveness and example more worthy of them and of her own kind and generous wishes By my soul Madam said I you stab me with your goodness your undeserved goodness and I cannot bear it  Why why thought I as I did several times in this conversation will she not  generously  forgive me Why will she make it necessary for me to bring my aunt and my cousin to my assistance Can the fortress expect the same advantageous capitulation which yields not to the summons of a resistless conqueror as if it gave not the trouble of bringing up and raising its heavy artillery against it  What  sensibilities  said the divine creature withdrawing her hand must thou have suppressed What a dreadful what a judicial hardness of heart must thine be who canst be capable of such emotions as sometimes thou hast shewn and of such sentiments as sometimes have flowed from thy lips  yet canst have so far overcome them all as to be able to act as thou hast acted and that from settled purpose and premeditation and this as it is  said  throughout the whole of thy life from infancy to this time  I told her that I had hoped from the generous concern she had expressed for me when I was so suddenly and dangerously taken illThe Ipecacuanha experiment Jack  She interrupted meWell have you rewarded me for the concern you speak of However I will frankly own now that I am determined to think no more of you that you might unsatisfied as I nevertheless was with you have made an interest  She paused I besought her to proceed  Do you suppose Sir and turned away her sweet face as we walked do you suppose that I had not thought of laying down a plan to govern myself by when I found myself so unhappily overreached and cheated as I may say out of myselfWhen I found that I could not  be  and  do  what I wished  to be  and  to do  do you imagine that I had not cast about what was the next proper course to take And do you believe that this next course has not cost me some pain to be obliged to  There again she stopt  But let us break off discourse resumed she The subject grows tooShe sigh'dLet us break off discourseI will go inI will prepare for church The devil thought I Well as I  can  appear in these everyday worn cloathslooking upon herself I will go to church  She then turned from me to go into the house  Bless me my beloved creature bless me with the continuance of this affecting conversationRemorse has seized my heartI have been excessively wrong Give me further cause to curse my heedless folly by the continuance of this calm but soulpenetrating conversation  No no Mr Lovelace I have said too much Impatience begins to break in upon me If you can excuse me to the ladies it will be better for my mind's sake and for your credit's sake that I do not see them Call me to  them  overnice petulant prudish what you please call me to them Nobody but Miss Howe to whom next to the Almighty and my own mother I wish to stand acquitted of wilful error shall know the whole of what has passed Be happy as you may  Deserve  to be happy and happy you will be in your own reflection at least were you to be ever so unhappy in other respects For myself if I shall be enabled on due reflection to look back upon my own conduct without the great reproach of having wilfully and against the light of my own judgment erred I shall be more happy than if I had all that the world accounts desirable  The noble creature proceeded for I could not speak  This selfacquittal when spirits are lent me to dispel the darkness which at present too often overclouds my mind will I hope make me superior to all the calamities that can befall me  Her whole person was informed by her sentiments She seemed to be taller than before How the God within her exalted her not only above me but above herself  Divine creature as I  thought  her I  called  her I acknowleged the superiority of her mind and was proceedingBut she interrupted meAll human excellence said she is comparative only My mind I believe is indeed superior to yours debased as yours is by evil habits But I had not known it to be so if you had not  taken pains  to convince me of the inferiority of yours  How great how sublimely great this creature By my soul I cannot forgive her for her virtues There is no bearing the consciousness of the infinite  inferiority she charged me withBut why will she break from me when good resolutions are taking placeThe redhot iron she refuses to strikeO why will she suffer the yielding wax to harden  We had gone but a few paces towards the house when we were met by the impertinent women with notice that breakfast was ready I could only with uplifted hands beseech her to give me hope of a renewed conversation after breakfast  No she would go to church  And into the house she went and upstairs directly Nor would she oblige me with her company at the teatable  I offered by Mrs Moore to quit both the table and the parlour rather than she should exclude herself or deprive the two widows of the favour of her company  That was not all the matter she told Mrs Moore She had been struggling to keep down her temper It had cost her some pains to do it She was desirous to compose herself in hopes to receive benefit by the divine worship she was going to join in  Mrs Moore hoped for her presence at dinner  She had rather be excused Yet if she could obtain the frame of mind she hoped for she might not be averse to shew that she had got above those sensibilities which gave consideration to a man who deserved not to be to her what he had been  This said no doubt to let Mrs Moore know that the gardenconversation had not been a reconciling one  Mrs Moore seemed to wonder that we were not upon a better foot of understanding after so long a conference and the more as she believed that the lady had given in to the proposal for the repetition of the ceremony which I had told them was insisted upon by her uncle Harlowe But I accounted for this by telling both widows that she was resolved to  keep on the reserve till she heard from Capt Tomlinson whether her uncle would be present in person at the solemnity or would name that worthy gentleman for his proxy  Again I injoined strict secrecy as to this particular which was promised by the widows as well for themselves as for Miss Rawlins of whose taciturnity they gave me such an account as shewed me that she was  secretkeepergeneral  to all the women of fashion at Hamstead  The Lord Jack What a world of mischief at this rate must Miss Rawlins knowWhat a Pandora's box must her bosom beYet had I nothing that was more worthy of my attention to regard I would engage to open it and make my uses of the discovery  And now Belford thou perceivest that all my reliance is upon the mediation of Lady Betty and Miss Montague and upon the hope of intercepting Miss Howe's next letter  THE fair inexorable is actually gone to church with Mrs Moore and Mrs Bevis But Will closely attends her motions and I am in the way to receive any occasional intelligence from him  She did not  choose  A mighty word with the sex as if they were always to have their own wills that I should wait upon her I did not much press it that she might not apprehend that I thought I had reason to doubt her voluntary return  I once had it in my head to have found the widow Bevis other employment And I believe she would have been as well pleased with my company as to go to church for she seemed irresolute when I told her that two out of a family were enough to go to church for one day But having her things on as the women call everything and her aunt Moore expecting her company she thought it best to go  Lest it should look oddly you know  whisper'd she to one who was above regarding how it look'd  LETTER XIX  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Sunday afternoon  O Belford what a hair'sbreadth escape have I had Such a one that I tremble between terror and joy at the thoughts of what  might  have happen'd and did not  What a perverse girl is this to contend with her fate yet has reason to think that her very stars fight against her I am the luckiest of men But my breath almost fails me when I reflect upon what a slender thread my destiny hung  But not to keep thee in suspense I have within this halfhour obtained possession of the expected letter from Miss HoweAnd by  such  an accident But here with the former I dispatch this thy messenger waiting  LETTER XX  Mr  LOVELACE  In Continuation  THUS it wasMy charmer accompanied Mrs Moore again to church this afternoon I had been very earnest in the  first  place to obtain her company at dinner But in vain According to what she had said to Mrs Moore  Page    I was  too considerable  to her to be allowed that favour In the  next  place I besought her to favour me after dinner with another gardenwalk But she  would  again go to church And what reason have I to rejoice that she did  My worthy friend Mrs Bevis thought one sermon a day  well  observed enough so stay'd at home to bear me company  The Lady and Mrs Moore had not been gone a  quarter of an hour when a young countryfellow on horseback came to the door and inquired for Mrs  Harriot Lucas  The widow and I undetermined how we were to entertain each other were in the parlour next the door and hearing the fellow's inquiry O my dear Mrs Bevis said I I am undone undone for ever if you don't help me outSince here in all probability is a messenger from that implacable Miss Howe with a letter which if delivered to Mrs Lovelace may undo all we have been doing  What said she would you have me do  Call the maid in this moment that I may give her her lesson and if it be as I imagine I'll tell you what you shall do  Widow  Margaret Margaret come in this minute  Lovel  What answer Mrs Margaret did you give the man upon his asking for Mrs  Harriot Lucas  Peggy  I only asked What was his business and who he came from For Sir your Honour's servant had told me how things stood And I came at your call Madam before he answer'd me  Lovel  Well child if ever you wish to be happy in wedlock yourself and would have people disappointed who want to make mischief between you and your husband get out of him his message or letter if he has one and bring it to me and say nothing to Mrs Lovelace when she comes in and here is a guinea for you  Peggy  I will do all I can to serve your Honour's Worship for nothing  Nevertheless with a ready hand taking the guinea  For Mr William tells me what a good gentleman you be  Away went Peggy to the fellow at the door  Peggy  What is your business friend with Mrs  Harry Lucas  Fellow  I must speak to her her own self  Lovel  My dearest widow do you personate Mrs LovelaceFor Heaven's sake do you personate Mrs Lovelace  Wid  I  personate Mrs Lovelace Sir How can I do thatShe is fair I am a brown woman She is slender I am plump  Lovel  No matter no matter The fellow may be a newcome servant He is not in livery I see He may not know her person You can but be bloated and in a dropsy  Wid  Dropsical people look not so fresh and ruddy as I do  Lovel  TrueBut the clown may not know That 'Tis but for a present deception  Peggy Peggy call'd I in a female tone softly at the door Madam answer'd Peggy and came up to me to the parlourdoor  Lovel  Tell him the Lady is ill and has lain down upon the couch And get his business from him whatever you do  Away went Peggy  Lovel  Now my dear widow lie along on the settee and put your handkerchief over your face that if he  will  speak to you himself he may not see your eyes and your hairSothat's right I'll step into the closet by you  I did so  Peggy  returning  He won't deliver his business to me He will speak to Mrs Harry Lucas her own self  Lovel  holding the door in my hand  Tell him that This is Mrs Harriot Lucas and let him come in Whisper him if he doubts that she is bloated dropsical and not the woman she was  Away went Margery  Lovel  And now my dear widow let me see what a charming Mrs Lovelace you'll makeAsk If he comes from Miss Howe Ask If he live with  her Ask How she does Call her at every word your dear Miss Howe Offer him moneyTake this halfguineaComplain of your head to have a pretence to hold it down and cover your forehead and eyes with your hand where your handkerchief hides not your faceThat's rightAnd dismiss the rascalHere he comesas soon as you can  In came the fellow bowing and scraping his hat poked out before him with both his hands  Fellow  I am sorry Madam and please you to find you be'n't well  Widow  What is your business with me friend  Fellow  You are Mrs Harriot Lucas I suppose Madam  Widow  Yes Do you come from Miss Howe  Fellow  I do Madam  Widow  Dost thou know my right name friend  Fellow  I can give a shrewd guess But that is none of my business  Widow  What  is  thy business I hope Miss Howe is well  Fellow  Yes Madam pure well I thank God I wish you were so too  Widow  I am too full of grief to be well  Fellow  So belike I have  hard  say  Widow  My head akes so dreadfully I cannot hold it up I must beg of you to let me know your business  Fellow  Nay and that be all my business is soon known It is but to give this letter into your own  partiklar  handsHere it is  Widow  Taking it  From my dear friend Miss HoweAh my head  Fellow  Yes Madam But I am sorry you are so bad  Widow  Do you live with Miss Howe  Fellow  No Madam I am one of her tenant's sons Her ladymother must not know as how I  came of this errand But the letter I suppose will tell you all  Widow  How shall I satisfy you for this kind trouble  Fellow  Na how at all What I do is for love of Miss Howe She will satisfy me more than enough But mayhap you can send no answer you are so ill  Widow  Was you order'd to wait for an answer  Fellow  No I can't say I was But I was bidden to observe how you looked and how you was and if you did write a line or so to take care of it and give it only to our young landlady in secret  Widow  You see I look strangely Not so well as I used to do  Fellow  Nay I don't know that I ever saw you but once before and that was at a stile where I met you and my young landlady but knew better than to stare a gentlewoman in the face especially at a stile  Widow  Will you eat or drink friend  Fellow  A cup of small ale I don't care if I do  Widow  Margaret take the young man down and treat him with what the house affords  Fellow  Your servant Madam But I staid to eat as I came along just upon the Heath yonder or else to say the truth I had been here sooner    Thank my stars thought I thou didst    A piece of powder'd beef was upon the table at the sign of the Castle where I stopt to inquire for this house And so thoff I only intended to whet my whistle I could not help eating So shall only taste of your ale for the beef was woundily corn'd  He withdrew bowing and scraping  Pox on thee thought I Get thee gone for a prating dog  Margaret whisper'd I in a female voice whipping out of the closet and holding the parlourdoor in my hand Get him out of the house as fast as you  can lest they come from church and catch him here  Peggy  Never fear Sir  The fellow went down and it seems drank a large draught of ale and Margaret finding him very talkative told him she begg'd his pardon but she had a sweetheart just come from sea whom she was forced to hide in the pantry so was sure he would excuse her from staying with him  Ay ay to be sure the clown said  For if he could not make sport he would spoil none  But he whisper'd her that one 'Squire Lovelace was a  damnation rogue  if the truth might be told  For what said Margaret And could have given him she said a good dowse of the chaps  For kissing all the women he came near  At the same time the dog wrapp'd himself round Margery and gave her a smack that she told Mrs Bevis afterwards she might have heard into the parlour  Such Jack is human nature Thus does it operate in all degrees and so does the clown as well as his betters practise what he censures and censure what he practises Yet this sly dog knew not but the wench had a sweetheart lock'd up in the pantry If the truth were known some of the ruddyfaced dairy wenches might perhaps call him a  damnation rogue  as justly as their betters of the same sex might 'Squire Lovelace  The fellow told the maid that by what he discern'd of the young lady's face it look'd very  rosy  to what he took it to be and he thought her a good deal fatter as she lay and not so tall  All women are born to intrigue Jack and practise it more or less as fathers guardians governesses from dear experience can tell and in loveaffairs are naturally expert and quicker in their wits by half than men This ready tho' raw wench gave an instance of this and improved on the dropsical hint I had  given her The lady's seeming plumpness was owing to a dropsical disorder and to the round posture she lay inVery likely truly Her appearing to him to be shorter he might have observed was owing to her drawing her feet up from pain and because the couch was too short she suppos'dAdso he did not think of that Her rosy colour was owing to her grief and headachAy that might very well beBut he was highly pleas'd he had given the letter into Mrs Harriot's own hand as he should tell Miss Howe  He desir'd once more to see the lady at his going away and would not be denied The widow therefore sat up with her handkerchief over her face leaning her head against the wainscot  He asked If she had any  partiklar  message  No She was so ill she could not write which was a great grief to her  Should he call next day for he was going to London now he was so near and should stay at a cousin's that night who lived in a street call'd Fetterlane  No She would write as soon as able and send by the post  Well then if she had nothing to send by him mayhap he might stay in town a day or two for he had never seen the Lions in the Tower nor Bedlam nor the Tombs and he would make a holiday or two as he had leave to do if she had no business or message that required his posting down next day  She had not  She offered him the halfguinea I had given her for him but he refused it with great professions of disinterestedness and love as he called it to Miss Howe to serve whom he would ride to the world's end or  even  to Jericho  And so the shocking rascal went away And glad at my heart was I when he was gone for I feared  nothing so much as that he would have staid till they came from church  Thus Jack got I my  heart'sease  the letter of Miss Howe and thro' such a train of accidents as makes me say that the Lady's stars fight against her But yet I must attribute a good deal to my own precaution in having taken right measures For had I not secured the widow by my stories and the maid by my servant all would have signified nothing And so heartily were they secured the one by a single guinea the other by half a dozen warm kisses and the aversion they both had to such wicked creatures as delighted in making mischief between man and wife that they promised that neither Mrs Moore Miss Rawlins Mrs Lovelace nor anybody living till a week at least were past and till I gave leave should know any thing of the matter  The widow rejoiced that I had got the mischiefmaker's letter I excused myself to her and instantly withdrew with it and after I had read it fell to my shorthand to acquaint thee with my good luck And they not returning so soon as church was done stepping as it proved in to Miss Rawlins's and tarrying there a while to bring that busy girl with them to drink tea I wrote thus far to thee that thou mightest when thou camest to this place rejoice with me upon the occasion  They are all three just come inI hasten to them  LETTER XXI  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  I Have begun another letter to thee in continuation of my narrative But I believe I shall send thee this before I shall finish that By the inclosed thou wilt see that neither of the correspondents deserve mercy from me And I am resolved to make the ending with one the beginning with the other  If thou sayest That the provocations I have given to  one  of them will justify  her  freedoms I answer So they  will  to any other person but myself But he that is capable of giving those provocations and has the power to punish those who abuse him  for  giving them  will  shew his resentment and the more vindictively perhaps as he has  deserved  the freedoms  If thou sayest It is however wrong to do so I reply that it is nevertheless human natureAnd would'st not have me be a man Jack  Here read the letter if thou wilt But thou art not my friend if thou offerest to plead for either of the saucy creatures after thou  hast  read it  To Mrs  HARRIOT LUCAS  at Mrs  MOORE  's at  Hamstead  AFTER the discoveries I had made of the villainous machinations of the  most abandoned of men  particularized in my long letter of Wednesday last  Vol  iv  p    you will believe my dearest friend that my surprize upon perusing yours of Thursday evening from Hamstead  See Vol  iv  p    was not so great as my indignation Had the  villain  attempted to fire a city instead of a house I should not have wondered at it All that I am amazed at is that he whose boast as I am told it is that no woman shall keep him out of her bedchamber when he has made a resolution to be in it did not discover  his foot  before And it is as strange to me that having got you at such a shocking advantage and in such an horrid house you could at the time  escape dishonour  and afterwards get from such a set of  infernals  I gave you in my long letter of Wednesday and Thursday last reasons why you ought to mistrust that specious Tomlinson That man my dear must be a solemn villain  May lightning from Heaven blast the wretch who has set him and the rest of his  REMORSELESS GANG  at work to endeavour to destroy the most consummate virtue  Heaven be praised you have escaped from all their snares and  now are out of danger  So I will not trouble you at present with the particulars that I have further collected relating to this abominable imposture  For the same reason I forbear to communicate to you some  new stories  of the  abhorred wretch himself  which have come to my ears One in particular of so  shocking  a natureIndeed my dear the man is a devil  The whole story of Mrs Fretchville and her house I have no doubt to pronounce likewise an absolute fiction  Fellow How my soul spurns the villain  Your thought of going abroad and your reasons for so doing most sensibly affect me But be comforted my dear I hope you will not be under a necessity of quitting your native country Were I sure that That must be the cruel case I would abandon all my own better prospects and soon be with you And I would accompany you whithersoever you went and share fortunes with you For it is impossible that I should be happy if I knew that you were exposed not only to the perils of the sea but to the attempts of other vile men your personal graces attracting every eye and exposing you to those hourly dangers which others less distinguished by the gifts of nature might avoidAll that I know that Beauty so greatly coveted and so greatly admired is good for  O my dear were I ever to marry and to be the mother of a CLARISSA  Clarissa  must be the name if promisingly lovely how often would my heart ake for the dear creature as she grew up when I reflected that a prudence and discretion unexampled in woman had not in  you  been a sufficient protection to that beauty which had drawn after it as many admirers as beholdersHow little should I regret the attacks of that  cruel  distemper as it is  called which frequently makes the greatest ravages in the finest faces  Sat Afternoon  I HAVE just parted with Mrs Townsend  For the account of Mrs Townsend c see Vol  iv  p    I thought you had once seen her with me But she says she never had the honour to be personally known to you She has a  manlike spirit  She knows the world And her two brothers being in town she is sure she can engage them in so good a cause and if there should be occasion  both their ships crews  in your service  Give your consent my dear and the  horrid villain  shall be repaid with  broken bones at least  for all his vileness  The misfortune is Mrs Townsend cannot be with you till  Thursday next  or  Wednesday at soonest  Are you sure you can be safe where you are till then I think you are too near London and perhaps you had better be  in it  If you remove let me know  whither  the very moment  How my heart is torn to think of the necessity so dear a creature is driven to of hiding herself  Devilish fellow  He must have been sportive and wanton in his inventionsYet that cruel that savage sportiveness has saved you from the sudden violence which he has had recourse to in the violation of others of names and families not contemptible For such the  villain  always gloried to spread his snares  The  vileness  of this  specious monster  has done more than any other consideration could do to bring Mr Hickman into credit with me Mr Hickman alone knows for me of your flight and the reason of it Had I not given him the reason he might have thought  still worse  of the vile attempt I communicated it to him by shewing him your letter from Hamstead  When he had read it  and he trembled  and  reddened  as he read he threw himself at my feet and besought me to permit him to attend you and to give you the protection of his house The goodnatured man had tears in his eyes and was repeatedly earnest on this subject proposing to take his chariotandfour or a set and in person in the face of all the world give himself the glory of protecting such an oppressed innocent  I could not but be pleased with him And I let him know that I was I hardly expected so much spirit from him But a man's passiveness to a beloved object of our sex may not perhaps argue want of courage on proper occasions  I thought I ought in return to have some consideration for his safety as such an open step would draw upon him the vengeance of the most  villainous enterprizer  in the world who has always a  gang of fellows  such as himself at his call ready to support one another in the vilest outrages But yet as Mr Hickman might have strengthened his hands by legal recourses I should not have stood upon it had I not known your delicacies since such a step must have made a great noise and given occasion for scandal as if some advantage had been gained over you and were there not the greatest probability that all might be more silently and more effectually managed by Mrs Townsend's means  Mrs Townsend will in person attend youShe  hopes  on WednesdayHer brothers and some of their people will scatteringly and as if they knew nothing of you so we have contrived see you safe not only to London but to her house at Deptford  She has a kinswoman who will take your commands there if she herself be obliged to leave you And there you may stay till the wretch's fury on losing you and his search are over  He will very soon 'tis likely enter upon some  new villainy  which may engross him And it may be given out that you are gone to lay claim to the protection of your cousin Morden at Florence  Possibly if he can be made to believe it he will go over in hopes to find you there  After a while I can procure you a lodging in one of the neighbouring villages where I may have the happiness to be your daily visiter And if this Hickman be not silly and apish and if my mother do not do unaccountable things I may the sooner think of marrying that I may without controul receive and entertain the darling of my heart  Many very many happy days do I hope we shall yet see together And as this is  my  hope I expect that it will be  your  consolation  As to your estate since you are resolved not to litigate for it we will be patient either till Col Morden arrives or till shame compels some people to be just  Upon the whole I cannot but think your prospects  now  much happier than they could have been had you been actually married to such a man as this I must therefore congratulate you upon your escape not only from a  horrid libertine  but from  so vile a husband  as he  must  have made to any woman but more especially to a person of your virtue and delicacy  You hate him heartily hate him I hope my dear I am sure you do It would be strange if so much purity of life and manners were not to abhor what is so repugnant to itself  In your letter before me you mention one written to me for a  feint  Vol  iv  p    I have not received any such Depend upon it therefore that he must have it And if he has it is a wonder that he did not likewise get my long one of the th Heaven be  praised that he did not  and that it came safe to your hands  I send this by a young fellow whose father is one of our tenants with command to deliver it to no other hands but yours He is to return directly if you give him any letter If not he will proceed to London upon his own pleasures He is a simple fellow but very honest So you may say any thing to him If you write not by him I desire a line or two as soon as possible  My mother knows nothing of his going to you Nor yet of your abandoning  the fellow  Forgive meBut he's not intitled to good manners  I shall long to hear how you and Mrs Townsend order matters I wish she could have been with you sooner But I have lost no time in engaging her as you will suppose I refer to  her  what I have further to say and advise So shall conclude with my prayers that Heaven will direct and protect my dearest creature and make your future days happy  ANNA HOWE  AND now Jack I will suppose that thou hast read this cursed letter Allow me to make a few observations upon some of its contents which I will do in my crowquill shorthand that they may have the appearance of notes upon the vixen's text  It is strange to Miss Howe that having got her friend at such a shocking advantage  c And it is strange to me too If ever I have such another opportunity given me the cause of both our wonder I believe will cease  So thou seest Tomlinson is further detected No such person as Mrs Fretchville  May lightning from heaven  O Lord O Lord O Lord What a horrid vixen is this My  gang  my  remorseless gang  too is brought inAnd thou wilt plead for these girls again wilt thou  Heaven be praised  she says that her friend is out of danger Miss Howe should be sure of  that  And that she herself is safeBut for this termagant as I have often said I must surely have made a better hand of it  New stories  of me JackWhat can they beI have not found that my generosity to my Rosebud ever did me  due  credit with this  pair of friends Very hard Belford that Credits cannot be set against Debits and a balance struck in a Rake's favour as well as in that of every  common  manBut he from whom no good is expected is not allowed the merit of the good he does  I ought to have been a little more attentive to  character  than I have been For notwithstanding that the measures of Right and Wrong are said to be so manifest let me tell thee that  character  byasses and runs away with all mankind Let a man or woman once establish themselves in the world's opinion and all that either of them do will be sanctified Nay in the very courts of justice does not  character  acquit or condemn as often as facts and sometimes even in spite of factsYet impolitic that I have been and am to be so careless of mineAnd now I doubt it is irretrievableBut to leave moralizing  Thou Jack knowest almost all my enterprizes worth remembring Can this particular story which this girl hints at be that of Lucy VillarsOr can she have heard of my intrigue with the pretty Gypsey who met me in Norwood and of the trap I caught her cruel husband in a fellow as gloomy and tyrannical as old Harlowe when he pursued a wife who would not have deserved ill of  him  if he had deserved well of  her  But he was not quite drowned The man is alive at this day And Miss Howe mentions the story as a  very  shocking one Besides both these are a twelvemonth old or more  But evil fame and scandal are always  new  When the offender has forgot a vile fact it is often told to one and to another who having never heard of it before trumpet it about as a novelty to others But well said the honest corregidor at Madrid a saying with which I inriched Lord M's collection  Good actions are remembered but for a day Bad ones for many years after the life of the guilty  Such is the relish that the world has for scandal In other words Such is the desire which everyone has to exculpate himself by blackening his neighbour You and I Belford have been very kind to the world in furnishing it with many opportunities to gratify its devil  Miss Howe will abandon her own better prospects and share fortunes with her were she to go abroad  Charming RomancerI must set about this girl Jack I have always had hopes of a woman whose passions carry her into such altitudesHad I attacked Miss Howe first her passions inflamed and guided as I could have managed them would have brought her to my lure in a fortnight  But thinkest thou and yet I think thou dost that there is any thing in these high flights among the sex Verily Jack these vehement friendships are nothing but chaff and stubble liable to be blown away by the very wind that raises them Apes mere apes of  us  they think the word  friendship  has a pretty sound with it and it is much talked of a fashionable word And so truly a single woman who thinks she has a Soul and knows that she wants something would be thought to have found a fellowsoul for it in her own Sex But I repeat that the word is a  mere  word the thing a mere name with them a corkbottomed shuttlecock which they are fond of striking to and fro to make one another glow in the frosty weather of a single state but which when a  man  comes in between the pretended  inseparables  is given up like their Music and other maidenly amusements which nevertheless may be necessary to keep the pretty  rogues out of more active mischief They then in short having caught the  fish  lay aside the  net  He alludes here to the story of a pope who once a poor fisherman thro' every preferment he rose to even to that of the cardinalate hung up in view of all his guests his net as a token of humility But when he arrived at the pontificate he took it down saying That there was no need of the net when he had caught the fish    Thou hast a mind perhaps to make an exception for these two ladies With all my heart My Clarissa has if  woman  has a soul capable of friendship Her flame is bright and steady But Miss Howe's were it not kept up by her mother's opposition is too vehement to endure How often have I known opposition not only cement Friendship but create Love I doubt not but poor Hickman would fare the better with this vixen if her mother were as heartily against him as she is for him  Thus much indeed as to these two ladies I will grant thee that the active spirit of the one and the meek disposition of the other may make their friendship more durable than it would otherwise be for this is certain that in every friendship whether male or female there must be a man and a woman spirit that is to say one of them a  forbearing  one to make it permanent  But this I pronounce as a truth which all experience confirms that friendship between women never holds to the sacrifice of capital gratifications or to the endangering of life limb or estate as it often does in our nobler sex  Well but next comes an indictment against poor  Beauty  What has Beauty done that  Miss Howe  should be offended at itMiss Howe Jack is a charming girl  She  has no reason to quarrel with BeautyDidst ever see herToo much fire and spirit in her eye indeed for a girlBut that's no fault with a man that can lower that fire and spirit at pleasure and I know I am the man that can  A sweet auburn Beauty is Miss Howe A first Beauty among beauties when her sweeter friend with such a commixture of serene gracefulness of natural elegance of native sweetness yet conscious tho' not arrogant dignity every feature glowing with intelligence is not in company  The difference between the two when together I have sometimes delighted to  read  in the addresses of a stranger entering into the presence of both when standing side by side There never was an instance on such an occasion where the stranger paid not his first devoirs to my Clarissa  A respectful solemn awe sat upon every feature of the addresser's face His eye seemed to ask leave to approach her and lower than common whether man or woman was the bow or courtesy And altho' this awe was immediately diminished by her condescending sweetness yet went it not so intirely off but that you might see the reverence remain as if the person saw more of the goddess than the woman in her  But the moment the same stranger turns to Miss Howe tho' proud and saucy and erect and bridling she you will observe by the turn of his countenance and the air of his address a kind of equality  assumed He appears to have discovered the woman in her charming as that woman is He smiles He seems to expect repartee and smartness and is never disappointed But then visibly he prepares himself to  give  as well as  take  He dares after he has been a while in her company to dispute a point with her Every point yielded up to the other tho' no assuming or dogmatical air compels it  In short with Miss Howe a bold man sees No doubt but Sir George Colmar did that he and she may either very soon be familiar together I mean with innocence or he may so far incur her displeasure as to be forbid her presence for ever  For my own part when I was first introduced to this lady which was by my goddess when she herself was a visiter at Mrs Howe's I had not been half an hour with her but I even hungred and thirsted after a rompingbout with the lively rogue and in the second or third visit was more deterred by the delicacy of her friend than by what I apprehended from her own This charming creature's presence thought I awes us both And I wished her absence tho' any other lady were present that I might try the difference in Miss Howe's behaviour before her friend's face or behind her back  Delicate ladies make delicate ladies as well as decent men With all Miss Howe's fire and spirit it was easy to see by her very eye that she watched for lessons and feared reproof from the penetrating eye of her milderdisposition'd friend  Miss Howe in vol  iii  p    says That she was always more afraid of her than of her mother and in p    That she fears her as much as she loves her and in many other places in her letters to Miss Harlowe verifies this observation of Mr Lovelace  And yet it was as easy to observe in the candor and sweet manners of the other that the fear which Miss Howe stood in of her was more owing to her own generous apprehension that she fell short of her excellencies than to Miss Harlowe's consciousness of excellence over  her  I have often since I came at Miss Howe's letters revolved this just and fine praise contained in one of them  Vol  iv  p      Every one saw that the preference each gave  you  to  herself  exalted you not into any visible triumph over her for you had always something to say on every point you carried that raised the yielding heart and left every one pleased and satisfied with herself tho' she carried not off the palm  As I propose in my more advanced life to endeavour to atone for my youthful freedoms with individuals of the sex by giving caution and instructions to the whole I have made a memorandum to inlarge upon this doctrineto wit That it is full as necessary to direct daughters in the choice of their female companions as it is to guard them against the designs of men  I say not this however to the disparagement of Miss Howe She has from  pride  what her friend has from  principle  The Lord help the sex if they had not prideBut yet I am confident that Miss Howe is indebted to the conversation and correspondence of Miss Harlowe for her highest improvements But both these ladies out of the question I make no scruple to averr And I Jack should know something of the matter that there have been more girls ruined at least  prepared  for ruin by their own sex taking in servants as well as companions than  directly  by the attempts and delusions of men  But it is time enough when I am old and joyless to enlarge upon this topic  As to the comparison between the two ladies I will expatiate more on that subject for I like it when I have  had them both  Which this letter of the vixen girl's I hope thou wilt allow warrants me to try for  I return to the consideration of a few more of its contents to justify my vengeance so nearly now in view  As to Mrs Townsend her manlike spirit her two brothers and their ships crewsI say nothing but this to the insolent threatening Let 'em come  But as to her sordid menaceTo  repay the horrid villain  as she calls me  for all my vileness  by BROKEN BONESBroken bones BelfordWho can bear this porterly threatningBroken bones JackDamn the little vulgarGive me a name for herBut I banish all furious resentment If I get these two girls into my power Heaven forbid that I should be a second Phalaris and turn his bull upon the artist No bones of theirs will I breakThey shall come off with me upon much lighter terms  But these fellows are smugglers it seems And am not I a smuggler tooI have not the least doubt that I shall have secured my goods before Thursday or Wednesday either  But did I want a plot what a charming new one does this letter of Miss Howe strike me out I am almost sorry that I have fixed upon oneFor here how easy would it be for me to assemble a crew of swabbers and to create a Mrs Townsend whose person thou seest my Beloved knows not to come on Tuesday at Miss Howe's  renewed  urgency in order to carry my Beloved to a warehouse of my own providing  This however is my triumphant hope that at the very time that these ragamuffins will be at Hamstead looking for us my dear Miss Harlowe and I so the fates I imagine have ordained shall be fast asleep in each other's arms in townLie still villain till the time comesMy heart Jack my heartIt is always thumping away on the remotest prospects of this nature  But it seems that  the vileness of this specious monster  meaning me Jack has brought Hickman into credit with her So I have done  some  goodBut to whom I cannot tell For this poor fellow should I permit him to have this termagant will be punished as many times we all are by the enjoyment of his own wishesNor can she be happy as I take it with him were he to govern himself by her will and have none of his own since never was there a directing wife who knew where to stop Power makes such a one wanton She despises the man she can govern Like Alexander who wept that he had no more worlds to conquer she will be looking out for new exercises for her power till she grow uneasy to herself a discredit to her husband and a plague to all about her  But this honest fellow it seems with  tears in his eyes  and with  humble prostration  besought the vixen to  permit  him to set out in his  chariot and four  in order to  give himself the glory of protecting such  an oppressed innocent in the face of the whole world  Nay he  redden'd  it seems and  trembled  too as he read the fair complainant's letterHow  valiant  is all thisWomen love  brave  men and no wonder that his  tears  his  trembling  and his  prostration  gave him high reputation with the  meek  Miss Howe  But dost think Jack that I in the like case and equally affected with the distress should have acted thusDost think that I should not first have rescued the lady and then if needful have asked excuse for it the lady in my handWouldest not  thou  have done thus as well as I  But 'tis best as it is Honest Hickman may now sleep in a whole skin And yet that is more perhaps than he would have done the lady's deliverance  unattempted  had I come at this  requested permission  of his any other way than by a letter that it must not be known I have intercepted  She thinks I may be diverted from pursuing my charmer by some newstarted  villainy Villainy  is a word that she is extremely fond of But I can tell her that it is impossible I should till the end of this  villainy  be obtained Difficulty is a  stimulus  with such a spirit as mine I thought Miss Howe knew me better Were she to offer herself person for person in the romancing zeal of her friendship to save her friend it should not do while the dear creature is on this side the moon  She thanks Heaven that her friend has received her letter of the th We are all glad of it She ought to thank me too But I will not at present claim her thanks  But when she rejoices that that letter went safe does she not in effect call out for vengeance and  expect  itAll in good time Miss Howe  When settest thou out for the Isle of Wight Love  I will close at this time with desiring thee to make a  list  of the virulent terms with which the inclosed letter abounds And then if thou supposest that I have made such another and have added to it all the flowers of the same blow in the former letters of the same fancy creature and those in that of Miss Harlowe left for me on her elopement thou wilt certainly think that I have provocations suffic  ent to justify me in all I shall do to either  Return the inclosed the moment thou hast perused it  LETTER XXII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq    Sunday NightMonday Morning  I WENT down with revenge in my  heart  the contents of Miss Howe's letter almost engrossing me the moment that Miss Harlowe and Mrs Moore accompanied by Miss Rawlins came in But in my  countenance all the gentle the placid the serene that the glass could teach and in my behaviour all the polite that such an unpolite creature as she has often told me I am could put on  Miss Rawlins was sent for home almost as soon as she came in to entertain an unexpected visiter to her great regret as well as to the disappointment of my fair one as I could perceive from the looks of both For they had agreed it seems if I went to town as I said I intended to do to take a walk upon the heath at least in Mrs Moore's garden and who knows what might have been the issue had the spirit of curiosity in the one met with the spirit of communication in the other  Miss Rawlins promised to return if possible But sent to excuse herself her visiter intending to stay with her all night  I rejoiced in my heart at her message and after much supplication obtained the favour of my Beloved's company for another walk in the garden having as I told her abundance of things to say to propose and to be informed of in order ultimately to govern myself in my future steps  She had vouchsafed I should tell thee with eyes turned from me and in an  halfaside  attitude to sip two dishes of tea in my companyDear soulHow anger  unpolishes  the most polite for I never saw Miss Harlowe behave so aukwardly I imagined she knew not how to be aukward  When we were in the garden I poured my whole soul into her attentive ear and besought her returning favour  She told me that she had formed her scheme for her future life That vile as the treatment was which she had received from me that was not all the reason she had for rejecting my suit But that on the maturest deliberation she was convinced that she could  neither be happy with me nor make me happy and she injoined me for both our sakes to think no more of her  The Captain I told her was rid down post in a manner to forward my wishes with her uncle  Lady Betty and Miss Montague were undoubtedly arrived in town by this time  I would set out early in the morning to attend them  They adored her They longed to see her They  would  see herThey would not be denied her company into Oxfordshire  Where could she better go to be free from her brother's insultsWhere to be absolutely made unapprehensive of anybody elseMight I have any hopes of her returning favour if Miss Howe could be prevailed upon to intercede for me  Miss Howe prevailed upon to intercede for you  repeated she with a scornful bridle but a very pretty oneAnd there she stopt  I  repeated  the concern it would be to me to be under a necessity of mentioning the misunderstanding to Lady Betty and my cousin as a misunderstanding still to be made up and as if I were of very  little  consequence to a dear creature who was of so  much  to me urging that it would extremely lower me not only in my own opinion but in that of my relations  But still she referred to Miss Howe's next letter and all the concession I could bring her to in this whole conference was that she would wait the arrival and visit of the two ladies if they came in a day or two or before she received the expected letter from Miss Howe  Thank Heaven for this thought I And now may I go to town with hopes at my return to find thee dearest where I shall leave thee  But yet I shall not intirely trust to this as she may  find reasons to change her mind in my absence My fellow therefore who is in the house and who by Mrs Bevis's kind intelligence will know every step she can take shall have Andrew and a horse ready to give me immediate notice of her motions and moreover go where she will he shall be one of her retinue tho' unknown to herself if possible  This was all I could make of the fair Inexorable Should I be glad of it or sorry for it  Glad I believe And yet my pride is confoundedly abated to think that I had so little hold in the affections of this daughter of the Harlowes  Don't tell me that virtue and principle are her guides on this occasion'Tis  pride  a greater pride than my own that governs her Love she has none thou seest nor ever had at least not in a superior degreeLove never was under the dominion of  prudence  or of any  reasoning  powerShe cannot bear to be thought a  woman  I warrantAnd if in the last attempt I find her  not  one what will she be the worse for the tryalNo one is to blame for suffering an evil he cannot shun or avoid  Were a general to be overpower'd and robb'd by a highwayman would he be less fit for the command of an army on that accountIf indeed the general pretending great valour and having boasted that he never would be robb'd were to make but faint resistance when he was brought to the test and to yield his purse when he was master of his own sword then indeed will the highwayman who robs him be thought the braver man  But from these last conferences am I furnished with an argument in defence of my favourite purpose which I never yet pleaded  O Jack what a difficulty must a man be allowed to have to conquer a predominant passion be it what it will when the gratifying of it is in his  power  however wrong he knows it to be to resolve to gratify  it Reflect upon this and then wilt thou be able to account for if not to excuse a projected crime which has  habit  to plead for it in a breast as stormy as uncontroulable  This my new argument  Should she fail in the trial should I succeed and should she refuse to go on with me and even to marry me which I can have no notion ofAnd should she disdain to be obliged to me for the handsome provision I should be proud to make for her even to the  half of my estate  yet cannot she be altogether unhappyIs she not intitled to an independent fortune Will not Col Morden as her trustee put her in possession of it And did she not in our former conference point out the  way of life  that she always preferred to the  married life    To take her good Norton for her directress and guide and to live upon her own estate in the manner her grandfather desired she should live  See p      It is moreover to be considered that she cannot according to her own notions recover above  one half  of her fame were we now to intermarry so much does she think she has suffered by her going off with me And will she not be always repining and mourning for the loss of the  other half  And if she must live a life of such uneasiness and regret for  half  may she not as well repine and mourn for the  whole  Nor let me tell thee will her own scheme of penitence in this case be half so perfect if she do  not  fall as if she  does  For what a foolish penitent will she make who has nothing to repent of She piques herself thou knowest and makes it matter of reproach to me that she went not off with me by her own consent but was tricked out of herself  Nor upbraid thou me upon the meditated breach of vows so repeatedly made She will not thou seest  permit  me to fulfil them And if she  would  this I have to say that at the time I made the most solemn of them I was fully determined to keep them But what prince thinks himself obliged any longer to observe the articles of the most sacredly swornto treaties than suits with his interest or inclination altho' the consequence of the infraction must be as he knows the destruction of thousands  Is not this then the result of all that Miss Clarissa Harlowe if it be not her own fault may be as virtuous  after  she has lost her honour as it is called as she was  before  She may be a more eminent example to her sex and if she yield a  little  yield in the tryal may be a  completer penitent  Nor can she but by her own wilfulness be reduced to  low fortunes  And thus may her  old  nurse and she an  old  coachman and a pair of  old  coachhorses and two or three  old  maidservants and perhaps a  very old  footman or two for every thing will be old and penitential about her live very comfortably together reading  old  sermons and  old  prayerbooks and relieving  old  men and  old  women and giving  old  lessons and  old  warnings upon new subjects as well as  old  ones to the young ladies of her neighbourhood and so pass on to a good  old  age doing a great deal of good both by precept and example in her generation  And is a lady who can live thus prettily without  controul  who ever did prefer and who  still  prefers the  Single  to the  Married life  and who will be enabled to do every thing that the plan she had formed will direct her to do be said to be ruined undone and such sort of stuffI have no patience with the pretty fools who use those strong words to describe the most transitory evil and which a mere churchform makes none  At this rate of romancing how many  flourishing  ruins  dost thou as well as I know Let us but look about us and we shall see some of the haughtiest and most  censorious  spirits among our acquaintance of that sex now passing for chaste wives of whom strange stories might be told and others whose husband's hearts have been made to ake for their gaieties both before and after marriage and yet know not half so much of them as some of us honest fellows could tell them  But having thus satisfied myself in relation to the worst that can happen to this  charming creature  and that it will be her own fault if she be unhappy I have not at all reflected upon what is likely to be  my own lot  This has always been my notion tho' Miss Howe grudges us the best of the sex and says that the worst is too good for us  Vol  iv  p    That the wife of a libertine ought to be pure spotless uncontaminated To what purpose has such a one lived a free life but to know the world and to make his advantages of itAnd to be  very  serious it would be a misfortune to the public for two persons heads of a family to be both bad since between two such a race of varlets might be propagated Lovelaces and Belfords if thou wilt who might do great mischief in the world  Thou seest at bottom that I am not an abandoned fellow and that there is a mixture of gravity in me This as I grow older may increase and when my active capacity begins to abate I may sit down with the Preacher and resolve all my past life into vanity and vexation of spirit  This is certain that I shall never find a woman so well suited to my taste as Miss Clarissa Harlowe I only wish if I live to see that day that I may have such a lady as her to comfort and adorn my settingsun I have often thought it very unhappy for us both that so excellent a creature sprung up a little  too late for my  settingout  and a little too early in my  progress  before I can think of  returning  And yet as I have pick'd up the sweet traveller in my way I cannot help wishing that she would bear me company in the  rest  of my journey altho' she were to step out of her own path to oblige me And then perhaps we could put up in the  evening  at the same  inn  and be very happy in each other's conversation recounting the difficulties and dangers we had passed in our way to it  I imagine that thou wilt be apt to suspect that some passages in this letter were written in town Why Jack I cannot but say that the Westminster air is a little grosser than that at Hamstead and the conversation of Mrs Sinclair and the Nymphs less innocent than Mrs Moore's and Miss Rawlins's And I think in my heart that I can say and write those things at one place which I cannot at the other nor indeed anywhere else  I came to town about seven this morningAll necessary directions and precautions remember'd to be given  I besought the favour of an audience before I set out I was desirous to see which of her lovely faces she was pleased to put on after another night had passed But she was resolved I found to leave our quarrel open She would not give me an opportunity so much as to intreat her again to close it before the arrival of Lady Betty and my cousin  I had notice from my proctor by a few lines brought by man and horse just before I set out that all difficulties had been for two days past surmounted and that I might have the licence for fetching  I sent up the letter to my Beloved by Mrs Bevis It procured me not admittance tho' my request for  that  was sent with it  And now Belford I set out upon business  LETTER XXIII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Monday June    DIDST ever see a Licence Jack  NN by divine permission Lord Bishop of London To our wellbeloved in Christ Robert Lovelace  Your servant my good Lord What have I done to merit so much goodness who never saw your Lordship in my life  of the parish of St Martin's in the Fields Batchelor and Clarissa Harlowe of the same parish Spinster sendeth greetingWHEREAS ye are as is alleged determined to enter into the holy state of matrimony  This is only alleged thou observest  by and with the consent of c c c and are very desirous of obtaining your marriage to be solemnized in the face of the church We are willing that such your honest desires  Honest desires Jack  may more speedily have their due effect And therefore that ye may be able to procure such marriage to be freely and lawfully solemnized in the parishchurch of St Martin in the Fields or St Giles's in the Fields in the county of Middlesex by the rector vicar or curate thereof at any time of the year  At ANY time of the year Jack  without publication of banes Provided that by reason of any precontract  I verily think that I have had three or four precontracts in my time but the good girls have not claimed upon them of a long time  consanguinity affinity or any other lawful cause whatsoever there be no lawful impediment in this behalf and that there be not at this time any action suit plaint quarrel or demand moved or depending before any judge ecclesiastical or temporal for or concerning any marriage contracted by or with either of you and that the said marriage be openly solemnized in the church abovementioned between the hours of eight and twelve in the forenoon and without prejudice to the minister of the place where the said woman is a parishioner We  do hereby for good causes  It cost meLet me see JackWhat did it cost me  give and grant our licence or faculty as well to you the parties contracting as to the rector vicar or curate of the said church where the said marriage is intended to be solemnized to solemnize the same in manner and form abovespecified according to the rites and ceremonies prescribed in the Book of Commonprayer in that behalf published by authority of parliament Provided always That if hereafter any fraud shall appear to have been committed at the time of granting this licence either by false suggestions or concealment of the truth  Now this Belford is a little hard upon us For I cannot say that every one of our suggestions is literally trueSo in good conscience I ought not to marry under this licence  the licence shall be void to all intents and purposes as if the same had not been granted And in that case we do inhibit all ministers whatsoever if any thing of the premises shall come to their knowlege from proceeding to the celebration of the said marriage without first consulting Us or our Vicargeneral Given c  The follow the register's name and a large pendent seal with these words round it SEAL OF THE VICARGENERAL AND OFFICIALPRINCIPAL OF THE DIOCESE OF LONDON  A good whimsical instrument take it all together But what thinkest thou are the arms to this matrimonial harbingerWhy in the first place  Two crossed swords  to shew that marriage is a state of offence as well as defence  Three lions  to denote that those who enter into the state ought to have a triple proportion of courage And couldst thou have imagined that these priestly fellows in so solemn a case would cut their jokes upon poor souls who come to have their  honest desires  put in a way to be gratified there are  three crooked horns  smartly topknotted with ribbands which being the Ladies wear seem to indicate that they may very probably adorn as well as bestow the bull's feather  To describe it according to heraldryart if I am not mistakenGules two swords saltirewise Or second coat a chevron sable between three buglehorns Or  So it ought to be  On a chief of the second three lions rampant of the firstBut the devil take them for their hieroglyphics should I say if I were determined in good earnest to marry  And determined to marry I would be were it not for this consideration That once married and I am married for life  That's the plague of it Could a man do as the birds do change every Valentine's day A  natural  appointment for birds have not the  sense  forsooth to fetter themselves as we wiseacre men take great and solemn pains to do there would be nothing at all in it And what a glorious time would the  Lawyers  have on the one hand with their  Noverint universi's  and suits commenceable on restitution of goods and chattels and the  Parsons  on the other with their indulgencies renewable annually as  other  licences to the  honest desires  of their clients  Then were a stated mulct according to rank or fortune to be paid on every change towards the exigencies of the State But none on  renewals  with the  old loves  for the sake of encouraging constancy especially among the  minores  the change would be made sufficiently difficult and the whole Public would be the better for it while those children which the parents could not agree about maintaining might be considered as the  children of the Public  and provided for like the children of the antient Spartans who were as ours would in this case be a nation of heroes How Jack could I have improved upon Lycurgus's institutions had I been a lawgiver  Did I never shew thee a scheme which I drew up on such a notion as thisIn which I demonstrated the  conveniencies  and obviated the  inconveniences  of changing the present mode to this I believe I never did  I remember I proved to a demonstration that such a change would be a means of annihilating absolutely annihilating four or five very atrocious and capital sins  Rapes  vulgarly so called Adultery and Fornication nor would  Polygamy  be panted after Frequently would it prevent  Murders  and  Duelling  Hardly any such thing as  Jealousy  the cause of shocking violences would be heard of And Hypocrisy between man and wife be banished the bosoms of each Nor probably would the reproach of  barrenness  rest as now it too often does where it is least deservedNor would there possibly be such a person as a barren woman  Moreover what a multitude of domestic quarrels would be avoided were such a scheme carried into execution Since both sexes would bear with each other in the view that they could help themselves in a few months  And then what a charming subject for conversation would be the gallant and generous last partings between man and wife Each perhaps a new mate in eye and rejoicing secretly in the manumission could  afford  to be complaisantlysorrowful in appearance  He presented  her  with this jewel it will be said by the reporter for  example  sake She  him  with that How  he  wept How  she  sobb'd How they looked after one another  Yet that's the jest of it neither of them wishing to stand another twelvemonth's trial  And if giddy fellows or giddy girls misbehave in a first marriage whether from  noviceship  having expected to find more in the matter than can be found or from  perverseness  on  her  part or  positiveness  on  his  each being mistaken in the other A mighty difference Jack in the same person an  inmate  or a  visiter  what a fine opportunity will each have by this scheme of recovering a lost character and of setting all right in the next adventure  And O Jack with what joy with what rapture would the  changelings  or  changeables  if thou like that word better number the weeks the days the hours as the annual obligation approached to its desirable period  As for the Spleen or Vapours no such malady would be known or heard of The Physical tribe would indeed be the sufferers and the only sufferers since fresh health and fresh spirits the consequences of sweet blood and sweet humours the mind and body continually pleased with each other would perpetually flow in and the joys of  expectation  the highest of all our joys would salubriate and keep all alive  But that no Body of men might suffer the  Physicians  I thought might turn  parsons  as there would be a great demand for parsons Besides as they would be partakers in the general benefit they must be sorry fellows indeed if they preferred Themselves to the Public  Every one would be married a dozen times at least Both men and women would be careful of their characters and polite in their behaviour as well as delicate in their  persons  and elegant in their  dress  a great matter each of these let me tell thee to keep passion alive either to induce a  renewal  with the  old love  or to recommend themselves to a  new  While the newspapers would be crouded with paragraphs all the world their readers as all the world would be concerned to see  who and who's together    Yesterday for instance enter'd into the holy state of matrimony We should all speak reverently of matrimony then the Right Honourable Robert Earl Lovelace I shall be an Earl by that time with her Grace the Duchess dowager of Fiftymanors his Lordship's one and thirtieth wife  I shall then be contented perhaps to take up as it is called with a widow But she must not have had more than one husband neither Thou knowest that I am nice in these particulars  I know Jack that thou for thy part wilt approve of my scheme  As Lord M and I between us have three or four Boroughs at command I think I will get into Parliament in order to bring in a Bill for this good purpose  Neither will the houses of Parliament nor the houses of Convocation have reason to object to it And all the Courts whether  spiritual  or  sensual civil  or  uncivil  will find their account in it when passed in  o a Law  By my soul Jack I should be apprehensive of a general insurrection and that incited by the Women were such a Bill to be thrown out For here is the excellency of the scheme The women will have equal reason with the men to be pleased with it  D  st think that  old prerogative Harlowe  for example must not if such a Law were in being have pulled in his horns So excellent a lady as he has would never else have  renewed  with such a gloomy tyrant Who as well as all other tyrants must have been upon good behaviour from year to year  A termagant wife if such a Law were to pass would be a phoenix  The  churches  would be the only  marketplaces  for the fair sex and  domestic excellence  the capital recommendation  Nor would there be an  old maid  in Great Britain and all its territories For what an odd soul must she be who could not have her  twelvemonth's trial  In short a total alteration for the better in the  morals  and  way of l  fe  in both sexes must in a very few years be the consequence of such a sal  tary Law  Who would have expected such a one from me I wish the devil owe me not a spite for it  Then would not the distinction be very pretty Jack as in flowers Such a gentleman or such a lady is an ANNUALSuch a one a PERENNIAL  One difficulty however as I remember occurred to me upon the probability that a wife might be  ensient  as the lawyers call it But thus I obviated it  That no man should be allowed to marry another woman without his  then  wife's consent till she were broughttobed and he had defray'd all incident charges and till it was agreed upon between them whether the child should be  his hers  or the  public's  The women in this case to have what I call the  coercive option  For I would not have it in the man's power to be a dog neither  And indeed I gave the turn of the scale in every part of my scheme in the women's favour For dearly do I love the sweet rogues  How infinitely more preferable this my scheme than the polygamy one of the old patriarchs who had wives and concubines without number I believe David and Solomon had their hundreds  at a time  Had they not Jack  Let me add That  annual Parliaments  and  annual Marriages  are the projects next my heart How could I expatiate upon the benefits that would arise from both    LETTER XXIV  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  WELL but now my plots thicken and my employment of writing to thee on this subject will soon come to a conclusion For now having got the licence and Mrs Townsend with her tars being to come to Hamstead next Wednesday or Thursday and another letter possibly or message from Miss Howe to inquire how Miss Harlowe does upon the rustic's report of her ill health and to express her wonder that she has not heard from her in answer to hers on her escapeI must soon blow up the lady or be blown up myself And so I am preparing with Lady Betty and my cousin Montague to wait upon my Beloved with a coach and four or a set for Lady Betty will not stir out with a pair for the world tho' but for two or three miles And this is a wellknown part of her character  But as to her arms and crest upon the coach and trappings  Dost thou not know that a Blunt's must supply her while her own is newlining and repairing An opportunity she is willing to take now she is in town Nothing of this kind can be done to her mind in the country Liveries nearly Lady Betty's  Thou hast seen Lady Betty Lawrance several timesHast thou not Belford  No never in my life  But thou hast and lain with her too or fame does thee more credit than thou deservest Why Jack knowest thou not Lady Betty's other name  Other  nameHas she two  She has And what thinkest thou of Lady Bab Wallis  O the devil  Now thou hast it Lady Barbara thou knowest  lifted up in circumstances and by pride never appears or produces herself but on occasions special To pass to men of quality or price for a duchess or countess at least She has always been admired for a grandeur in her air that few women of quality can come up to And never was supposed to be other than what she passed for tho' often and often a paramour for Lords  And who thinkest thou is my cousin Montague  Nay how should I know  How indeed Why my little Johanetta Golding a lively yet modestlooking girl is my cousin Montague  There Belford is an auntThere's a cousin Both have wit at will Both are accustomed to ape quality Both are genteelly descended Mistresses of themselves and well educatedYet past pity True  Spartan  dames ashamed of nothing but  detection  Always therefore upon their guard against that And in their own conceit when assuming top parts the very quality they ape  And how dost think I dress them out I'll tell thee  Lady Betty in a rich gold tissue adorned with jewels of high price  My cousin Montague in a pale pink  nding an end with silver flowers of her own  Charlotte as well as my Beloved is admirable at her needle Not quite so richly jewel'd out as Lady Betty but earrings and solitaire very valuable and infinitely becoming  Johanetta thou knowest has a good complexion a fine neck and ears remarkably fineSo has Charlotte She is nearly of Charlotte's stature too  Laces both the richest that could be procured  Thou canst not imagine what a sum the loan of the jewels cost me tho' but for three days  This sweet girl will half ruin me But seest thou  not by this time that her reign is shortIt must be so And Mrs Sinclair has already prepared everything for her reception once more  HERE come the ladiesAttended by Susan Morrison a tenantfarmer's daughter as Lady Betty's woman with her hands before her and thoroughly instructed  How dress advantages womenespecially those who have naturally a genteel air and turn and have had education  Hadst thou seen how they paraded itCousin and Cousin and Nephew at every word Lady Betty bridling and looking haughtilycondescending Charlotte galanting her fan and swimming over the floor without touching it  How I long to see my nieceelect cries oneFor they are told that we are not married and are pleased that I have not put the slight upon them that they had apprehended from me  How I long to see my dear cousin that is to be the other  Your La'ship and your La'ship and an aukward courtesy at every address prim Susan Morrison  Top your parts ye villains You know how nicely I distinguish There will be no passion in  this case  to blind the judgment and to help on meditated delusion as when you engage with titled sinners My charmer is as cool and as distinguishing tho' not quite so learned in her own sex as I am Your commonlyassumed dignity won't do for me now Airs of superiority as if  born  to rank But no overdoDoubting nothing Let not your faces arraign your hearts  Easy and unaffectedYour very dresses will give you pride enough  A little  graver  Lady Betty More significance less bridling in your dignity  That's the air Charmingly hitAgainYou have it  Devil take youLess arrogance You are got into airs of  young quality  Be less sensible of your new condition People born to dignity command respect without needing to require it  Now for  your  part cousin Charlotte  Pretty well But a little too frolicky that air Yet have I prepared my Beloved to expect in you both great vivacity and qualityfreedom  Curse those eyesThose glancings will never do A downcast bashful turn if you can command it Look upon me Suppose me now to be my Beloved  Devil take that leer Too  significantly  arch Once I knew you the girl I would now have you to be  Sprightly but not confident cousin Charlotte Be sure forget not to look down or aside when looked at When eyes meet eyes be yours the retreating ones Your face will bear examination  O Lord O Lord that so young a creature can so soon forget the innocent appearance she first charmed by and which I thought born with you all Five years to ruin what Twenty had been building up How natural the latter lesson How difficult to regain the former  A stranger as I hope to be saved to the principal arts of your sex Once more whatadevil has your heart to do in your eyes  Have I not told you that my Beloved is a great observer of the eyes She once quoted upon me a text  Ecclus xxvi  The whoredom of a woman may be known in her haughty looks and eyelids Watch over an impudent eye and marvel not if it trespass against thee  which shewed me how she came by her  knowlege Dorcas's were found guilty of treason the first moment she saw her  Once more suppose me to be my charmer Now you are to encounter my  examining  eye and my  doubting  heart  That's my dear  Study that air in the pierglass  CharmingPerfectly right  Your honours now devils  Pretty well cousin Charlotte for a young country ladyTill form yields to familiarity you  may  courtesy low You must not be supposed to have forgot your boardingschool airs  But too low too low Lady Betty for your years and your quality The common fault of your sex will be your danger Aiming to be young too long The devil's in you all when you judge of yourselves by your wishes and by your vanity Fifty will then never be more than Fifteen  Graceful ease conscious dignity like that of my charmer O how hard to hit  Both together now  CharmingThat's the air Lady BettyThat's the cue cousin Charlotte suited to the character of eachBut once more be sure to have a guard upon your eyes  Never fear nephew  Never fear cousin  A dram of Barbados each  And now we are gone  LETTER XXV  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  At Mrs Sinclair's  Monday Afternoon  ALL's right as heart can wishIn spite of all objectionin spite of a reluctance next to faintingIn spite of all her foresight vigilance suspicion once more is the charmer of my soul in her new lodgings  Now throbs away every pulse Now thump thump thumps my bounding heart for something  But I have not time for the particulars of our management  My Beloved is now directing some of her cloaths to be packed upNever more to enter this house Nor ever more will she I dare say when once again out of it  Yet not so much as a condition of forgiveness The Harlowespirited Fairone will not  deserve  my mercyShe will wait for Miss Howe's next letter and then if she find a  difficulty in her new schemes  Thank her for nothing will Will what Why even  then  will take time to consider whether I am to be forgiven or for ever rejected An indifference that revives in my heart the remembrance of a thousand of the like natureAnd yet Lady Betty and Miss Montague One would be tempted to think Jack that they wish her to provoke my vengeance declare that I ought to be satisfied with such a proud suspension  They are intirely attached to her Whatever she says  is must be  gospelThey are guarantees for her return to Hamstead this night They are to go back with her A supper bespoke by Lady Betty at Mrs Moore's All the vacant apartments there by my permission for I had engaged them for a month certain to be filled with them and their attendants  for a week at least or till they can prevail upon the dear Perverse as they hope they shall to restore me to her favour and to accompany Lady Betty to Oxfordshire  The dear creature has thus far condescended That she will write to Miss Howe and acquaint her with the present situation of things  If she write I shall see what she writes But I believe she will have other employment soon  Lady Betty is sure she tells her that she shall prevail upon her to forgive me tho' she dares say that I deserve not forgiveness Lady Betty is too delicate to inquire strictly into the nature of my offence But it must be an offence against herself against Miss Montague against the virtuous of the whole Sex or it could not be so highly resented Yet she will not leave her till she forgive me and till she see our nuptials privately celebrated Mean time as she approves of her  uncle's expedient  she will address her as  already my wife before strangers  Stedman her solicitor may attend her for orders in relation to her Chanceryaffair at Hamstead Not one hour they  can  be favoured with will they lose from the company and conversation of so dear so charming a new relation  Hard then if she had not obliged them with her company in their coachandfour to and from their cousin Leeson's who longed as they themselves had done to see a lady so justly celebrated  'How will Lord M be raptured when he sees her 'and can salute her as his niece  How will Lady Sarah bless herselfShe will now think her loss of the dear daughter she mourns for happily supplied  Miss Montague dwells upon every word that falls from her lips She perfectly adores her new cousin  For her cousin she  must  be And her cousin will she call her She answers for equal admiration in her sister Patty  Ay cry I whispering loud enough for her to hear how will my cousin Patty's dove's eyes glisten and run over on the very first interview So gracious so noble so unaffected a dear creature  "What a happy family" chorus we all  will ours be  These and suchlike congratulatory admirations every hour repeated Her modesty hurt by the ecstatic praises  Her graces are too natural to herself for her to be proud of themBut she must be content to be punished for excellencies that cast a shade upon the  most  excellent  In short we are here as at Hamstead all joy and rapture All of us except my beloved in whose sweet face her almost fainting reluctance to reenter these doors not overcome reigns a kind of anxious serenity But how will even  that  be changed in a few hours  Methinks I begin to pity the halfapprehensive BeautyBut avaunt thou unseasonablyintruding pity Thou hast more than once already well nigh undone me And Adieu reflection Begone consideration and commiseration I dismiss ye all for at least a week to comeBe remembred her broken word Her flight when my fond soul was meditating mercy to herBe remembred her treatment of me in her letter on her escape to Hamstead Her Hamstead virulenceWhat is it she ought not to expect from an unchained Beelzebub and a plotting villain  Be her preference of the single life to  me  also remembredThat she despises meThat she even refuses to be my WIFEA proud Lovelace to be denied a  Wife  To be more proudly rejected by a daughter of the  Harlowes  The ladies of my own family She thinks them the ladies of my family supplicating in vain for her returning favour to their despised kinsman and taking laws from her still prouder punctilio  Be the execrations of her vixen friend likewise remembred poured out upon me from  her  representations and thereby made her  own  execrations  Be remembred still more particularly the Townsend plot set on foot between them and now in a day or two ready to break out and the  sordid threatenings  thrown out against me by that little fury  Is not  this  the crisis for which I have been long waiting Shall Tomlinson shall these women be engaged shall so many engines be set at work at an immense expence with infinite contrivance and all to no purpose  Is not  this  the hour of her trial And in  her  of the trial of the virtue of her whole Sex so long premeditated so long threatened Whether her frost is frost indeed Whether her virtue is principle Whether if  once subdued she will not be always subdued  And will she not want the very crown of her glory the proof of her till now allsurpassing excellence if I stop short of the ultimate trial  Now is the end of purposes long overawed often suspended at hand And need I to throw the sins of her cursed family into the too weighty scale  Abhorred be forceBe the thoughts of force There's no triumph over the will in force  This I know I have said  Vol  iv  p    But would I not have avoided it if I couldHave I not try'd every other method And have I any other recourse left me Can she resent the  last outrage  more than she has resented a  fainter effort  And if her resentments run ever so high cannot I repair by matrimonyShe will not refuse me I know Jack the haughty Beauty will not refuse me when her pride of being corporally inviolate is brought down when she can tell no tales but when be her resistance what it will even her own sex will suspect a yielding in resistance and  when that modesty which may fill her bosom with resentment will lock up her speech  But how know I that I have not made my own difficultiesIs she not a womanWhat redress lies for a perpetrated evilMust she not  live  Her piety will secure her life And will not  time  be my friendWhat in a word will be her behaviour afterwardsShe cannot fly meShe must forgive me And as I have often said  once forgiven will be for ever forgiven  Why then should this enervating pity unsteel my foolish heart  It shall not All these things will I remember and think of nothing else in order to keep up a resolution which the women about me will have it I shall be still unable to hold  I'll teach the dear charming creature to emulate me in contrivanceI'll teach her to weave webs and plots against her conquerorI'll shew her that in her smuggling schemes she is but a spider compared to me and that she has all this time been spinning only a cobweb  WHAT shall we do nowWe are immersed in the depth of grief and apprehensionHow ill do women bear disappointmentSet upon going to Hamstead and upon quitting for ever a house she reenter'd with infinite reluctance what things she intended to take with her ready pack'd up herself on tiptoe to be gone and I prepared to attend her thither she begins to be afraid that she shall not go this night and in grief and despair has flung herself into her old apartment lock'd herself in and thro' the keyhole Dorcas sees her on her knees praying I suppose for a safe deliverance  And from whatAnd wherefore these agonizing apprehensions  Why here this unkind Lady Betty  with  the  dear creature's knowlege tho' to her concern and this madheaded cousin Montague  without  it while she was employ'd in directing her package have hurried away in the coach to their own lodgingsOnly indeed to put up some nightcloaths and so forth in order to attend their sweet cousin to Hamstead and no less to my surprize than hers are not yet returned  I have sent to know the meaning of it  In a great hurry of spirits she would have had me gone myself Hardly any pacifying herThe girl God bless her is wild with her own idle apprehensionsWhat is she afraid of  I curse them both for their delayMy tardy villain how he staysDevil fetch them Let them send their coach and we'll go without them In her hearing I bid the fellow tell them soPerhaps he stays to bring the coach if any thing happens to hinder the ladies from attending my Beloved this night  DEVIL take them again say I They  promised  too they would not stay because it was but two nights ago that a chariot was robb'd at the foot of Hamstead hill which alarmed my fairone when told of it  Oh here's my aunt's servant with a billet  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Monday Night  EXcuse us dear nephew I beseech you to my dearest kinswoman One night cannot break squares For here Miss Montague has been taken violently ill with three fainting fits one after another The hurry of her joy I believe to find your dear lady so much surpass all expectation Never did familylove you know reign so strong as among us and the too eager desire she had to attend her have  occasioned it For she has but weak spirits poor girl well as she looks  If she be better we will certainly go with you tomorrow morning after we have breakfasted with her at your lodgings But whether she be or not I will do myself the pleasure to attend your lady to Hamstead and will be with you for that purpose about nine in the morning With due compliments to your most worthily beloved I am  Yours affectionately  ELIZAB LAWRANCE  Faith and troth Jack I know not what to do with myself For here just now having sent in the above note by Dorcas out came my beloved with it in her hand In a fit of phrensyTrue by my soul  She had indeed complained of her head all the evening  Dorcas ran to me out of breath to tell me that her lady was coming in some strange way But she followed her so quick that the frighted wench had not time to say in what way  It seems when she read the billetNow indeed said she am I a lost creature O the poor Clarissa Harlowe  She tore off her headcloaths inquired where I was And in she came her shining tresses flowing about her neck her ruffles torn and hanging in tatters about her snowy hands with her arms spread out her eyes wildly turned as if starting from their orbitsDown sunk she at my feet as soon as she approached me her charming bosom heaving to her uplifted face and clasping her arms about my knees Dear Lovelace said she if everif everif everAnd unable to speak another word quitting her clasping hold down prostrate on the floor sunk she neither in a fit nor out of one  I was quite astonishedAll my purposes suspended for a few moments I knew neither what to say nor what to do But recollecting myself Am I  again  thought I in a way to be overcome and made a fool ofIf I now recede I am gone for ever  I raised her But down she sunk as if quite disjointed her limbs failing heryet not in a fit neither I never heard of or saw such a dear unaccountable Almost lifeless and speechless too for a few momentsWhat must her apprehensions be at that moment And for what An highnotioned dear soulPretty ignorance thought I  Never having met with a repugnance so  greatly  repugnant I was stagger'd I was confounded Yet how should I know that it would be so till I try'dAnd how having proceeded thus far could I stop were I  not  to have had the women to goad me on and to make light of circumstances which they pretended to be better judges of than me  I lifted her however into a chair and in words of disordered passion told her All her fears were needless Wondered at them Begg'd of her to be pacified Besought her reliance on my faith and honour And revowed all my old vows and poured forth new ones  At last with an heartbreaking sob I see I see Mr Lovelace in broken sentences she spokeI see I seethat at lastat lastI am ruinedRuined If  your  pityLet me implore your pityAnd down on her bosom like a halfbrokenstalk'd lily topheavy with the overcharging dews of the morning sunk her head with a sigh that went to my heart  All I could think of to reassure her when a little recovered I said  Why did I not send for their coach as I had intimated It might return in the morning for the ladies  I had actually done so I told her on seeing her  strange uneasiness But it was then gone to fetch a doctor for Miss Montague lest his chariot should not be so ready  An Lovelace said she with a doubting face anguish in her imploring eye  Lady Betty would think it very strange I told her if she were to know it was so disagreeable to her to stay one night for  her  company in a house where she had passed  so many  She called me names upon thisShe had called me names beforeI was patient  Let her go to Lady Betty's lodgings then  directly  go if the person I called Lady Betty was really Lady Betty  IF my dear Good Heaven What a villain does that IF shew you believe me to be  I cannot help itI beseech you once more Let me go to Mrs Leeson's if  that  IF ought not to be said  Then assuming a more resolute spiritI will go I will inquire my wayI will go by myselfAnd would have rushed by me  I folded my arms about her to detain her pleading the bad way I heard poor Charlotte was in and what a farther concern her impatience if she went would give her  She would believe nothing I said unless I would instantly order a coach since she was not to have Lady Betty's nor was permitted to go to Mrs Leeson's and let her go in it to Hamstead late as it was and all alone so much the better For in the house of  people  of whom Lady Betty upon inquiry had heard a bad character  Dropt foolishly This by my prating new relation in order to do credit to herself by depreciating others  every thing and every face looking with so much meaning vileness as well as  my own Thou art still too sensible thought I my  charmer  she was resolved not to stay another night  Dreading what might happen as to her intellects and being very apprehensive that she might possibly go thro' a great deal before morning tho' more violent she could not well be with the worst she dreaded I humoured her and ordered Will to go and endeavour to get a coach directly to carry us to Hamstead I cared not at what price  Robbers whom I would have terrify'd her with she feared not  I  was all her fear I found and this house her terror For I saw plainly that she now believed that Lady Betty and Miss Montague were both impostors  But her mistrust is a little of the latest to do her service  And O Jack the rage of Love the rage of Revenge is upon me By turns they tear meThe progress already made The womens instigations The power I shall have to try her to the utmost and still to marry her if she be not to be brought to cohabitation Let me perish Belford if she escape me now  WILL is not yet come backNear eleven  WILL is this moment returnedNo coach to be got  for love or money  Once more she urgesTo Mrs Leeson's let me goLovelace Good Lovelace Let me go to Mrs Leeson'sWhat is Miss Montague's illness to my terrorFor the Almighty's sake Mr Lovelace her hands clasped  O my angel What a wildness is thisDo you know do you see my dearest life what an appearance your causeless apprehensions have given you Do you know it is past eleven o'clock  Twelve one two three fourany hourI  care notIf you mean me honourably let me go cut of this hated house  Thou'lt observe Belford that tho' this was written afterwards yet as in other places I write it as it was spoken and happened as if I had retired to put down every sentence as spoken I know thou likest this lively  presenttense  manner as it is one of my peculiars  Just as she had repeated the last words  If you mean me honourably let me go out of this hated house  in came Mrs Sinclair in a great fermentAnd what pray Madam has  this house  done to you Mr Lovelace you have known me some time and if I have not the niceness of this lady I hope I do not deserve to be treated thus  She set her huge arms akembo  Hoh  Madam let me tell you I am amazed at your freedoms with my character And Mr Lovelace holding up and violently shaking her head if you are a gentleman and a man of honour  Having never before seen any thing but obsequiousness in this woman little as she liked her she was frighted at her masculine air and fierce lookGod help me cry'd she What will become of me now Then turning her head hither and thither in a wild kind of amaze Whom have I for a protector What will become of me now  I  will be your protector my dearest loveBut indeed you are uncharitably severe upon poor Mrs Sinclair Indeed you areShe is a gentlewoman born and the relict of a man of honour and tho' left in such circumstances as oblige her to let lodgings yet would she scorn to be guilty of a wilful baseness  I hope soit may be soI may be mistaken ButBut there is no crime I presume no treason to say I don't like her house  The old dragon straddled up to her with her arms  kembo'd againHer eyebrows erect like the bustles upon a hog's back and scouling over her shortened nose more than halfhid her ferret eyes Her mouth was distorted She pouted out her blubberlips as if to bellows up wind and sputter into her horsenostrils and her chin was curdled and more than usually prominent with passion  With two  HohMadams  she accosted the frighted fairone who terrified caught hold of my sleeve  I feared she would fall into fits and with a look of indignation told Mrs Sinclair that these apartments were mine and I could not imagine what she meant either by listening to what passed between me and my spouse or to come in uninvited much less to give herself these violent airs  I may be to blame Jack for suffering this wretch to give herself these airs but her coming in was without my orders  The old Beldam throwing herself into a chair fell a blubbering and exclaiming And the pacifying of her and endeavouring to reconcile the lady to her took up till near one a clock  And thus between terror and the late hour and what followed she was diverted from the thoughts of getting out of the house to Mrs Leeson's or anywhere else  LETTER XXVI  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Tuesday Morn June    AND now Belford I can go no farther The affair is over Clarissa lives And I am  Your humble servant  R LOVELACE  The whole of this black transaction is given by the injured lady to Miss Howe in her subsequent letters dated Thursday July    To which the reader is referred  LETTER XXVII  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Watford  Wedn June    O Thou savagehearted monster What work hast thou made in  one guilty hour  for a  whole age  of repentance  I am inexpressibly concerned at the fate of this matchless lady She could not have fallen into the hands of any other man breathing and suffered as she has done with thee  I had written a great part of another long letter to try to soften thy flinty heart in her favour for I thought it but too likely that thou shouldest succeed in getting her back again to the accursed woman's But I find it would have been too late had I finished it and sent it away Yet cannot I forbear writing to urge thee to make the  only  amends thou now canst make her by a proper use of the License thou hast obtained  Poor poor lady It is a pain to me that I ever saw her Such an adorer of virtue to be sacrificed to the vilest of her sex and thou their implement in the devil's hands for a purpose so base so ungenerous so inhumane Pride thyself O cruellest of men in this reflection and that thy triumph over a lady who for thy sake was abandoned of every friend she had in the world was effected not by advantages taken of her weakness and credulity but by the blackest artifice after a long course of studied deceits had been tried to no purpose  I can tell thee it is well either for thee or for me that I am not the brother of the lady Had I been her brother her violation must have been followed by the blood of one of us  Excuse me Lovelace and let not the lady fare the worse for my concern for her And yet I have  but one  other  motive to ask thy excuse and that is because I owe to thy own communicative pen the knowlege I have of thy barbarous villainy since thou might'st if thou would'st have passed it upon me for a common seduction  CLARISSA LIVES thou say'st That she does is my wonder and these words shew that thou thyself tho' thou couldst nevertheless proceed hardly expectedst she would have survived the outrage What must have been the poor lady's distress watchful as she had been over her honour when dreadful certainty took place of cruel apprehensionAnd yet a man may guess what it must have been by that which thou paintest when she suspected herself trick'd deserted and betrayed by thy pretended aunt and cousin  That thou couldst behold her phrensy on this occasion and her halfspeechless halffainting prostration at thy feet and yet retain thy evil purposes will hardly be thought credible even by those who know  thee  if they have seen  her  Poor poor Lady With such noble qualities as would have adorned the most exalted married life to fall into the hands of the  only  man in the world who could have treated her as thou hast treated her And to let loose the old dragon as thou properly callest her upon the beforeaffrighted innocent what a barbarity was  that  What a  poor  piece of barbarity in order to obtain by terror what thou despairedst to do by love tho' supported by stratagems the most insidious  O  LOVELACE LOVELACE  had I doubted it before I should now be convinced that there must be a  WORLD AFTER THIS  to do justice to injured merit and to punish such a barbarous perfidy  Could the divine SOCRATES and the divine CLARISSA otherwise have suffered  But let me if possible for one moment try to  forget this villainous outrage on the most excellent of women  I have business here which will hold me yet a few days and then perhaps I shall quit this house for ever  I have had a solemn and tedious time of it I should never have known that I had half the respect I really find I had for the old gentleman had I not so closely at his earnest desire attended him and been a witness of the tortures he underwent  This melancholy occasion may possibly have contributed to humanize me But surely I never could have been so remorseless a caitiff as  thou  hast been to a woman of  half  this lady's excellence  But pr'ythee dear Lovelace if thou'rt a man and not a devil resolve out of hand to repair thy sin of ingratitude by conferring upon thyself the highest honour thou  canst  receive in making her lawfully thine  But if thou canst not prevail upon thyself to do her this justice I think I should not scruple a tilt with thee An everlasting rupture at least must follow if thou sacrificest her to the accursed women  Thou art desirous to know what advantage I reap by my uncle's demise I do not certainly know for I have not been so greedily sollicitous on this subject as some of the kindred have been who ought to have shewn more decency as I have told them and suffered the corpse to have been cold before they had begun their hungry inquiries But by what I gathered from the poor man's talk to me who oftener than I wished touched upon the subject I deem it will be upwards of  l  in cash and in the funds after all legacies paid besides the real estate which is a clear  l  a year  I wish from my heart thou wert a moneylover Were the estate to be of double the value thou shouldst have it every shilling only upon one condition  for my circumstances before were as easy as I wish them to be while I am singleThat thou wouldst permit me the honour of being this fatherless lady's  Father  as it is called at the altar  Think of this my dear Lovelace Be honest And let me present thee with the brightest jewel that man ever possessed and then body and soul wilt thou bind to thee for ever thy  BELFORD  LETTER XXVIII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Thursday June    LET me alone you great dog youLet me alonehave I heard a lesser boy his coward arms held over his head and face say to a bigger who was pummeling him for having run away with his apple his orange or his gingerbread  So say I to thee on occasion of thy severity to thy poor friend who as thou ownest has furnished thee ungenerous as thou art with the weapons thou brandishest so fearfully against himAnd to what purpose when the mischief is done when of consequence the affair is irretrievable and when a CLARISSA could not move me  Well but after all I must own that there is something very singular in this lady's case And at times I cannot help regretting that I ever attempted her since not one power either of body or soul could be moved in my favour and since to use the expression of the philosopher on a much graver occasion There is no difference to be found between the skull of king Philip and that of another man  But peoples extravagant notions of things alter not facts Belford And when all's done M  ss Clarissa Harlowe has but run the fate of a thousand others of her SexOnly that they did not set such a romantic  value upon what they call their  honour  that's all  And yet I will allow thee thisThat if a person sets a high value upon any thing be it ever such a trifle in itself or in the eye of others the robbing of that person of it is  not  a trifle to  him  Take the matter in this light I own I have done wrong great wrong to this admirable creature  But have I not known twenty and twenty of the sex who have seemed to carry their notions of virtue high yet when brought to the test have abated of their severity And how should we be convinced that  any  of them are proof till they are try'd  A thousand times have I said that I never yet met with such a woman as this If I  had  I hardly ever should have attempted Miss Clarissa Harlowe Hitherto she is all angel And was not that the point which at setting out I proposed to try  Vol  iii  p    And was not  cohabitation  ever my darling view And am I not now at last in the highroad to itIt is true that I have nothing to boast of as to her will The very contrary But now are we come to the test whether she cannot be brought to make the best of an irreparable evilIf she exclaim she has reason to exclaim and I will sit down with patience by the hour together to hear her exclamations till she is tired of them she will then descend to expostulation perhaps Expostulation will give me hope Expostulation will shew that she hates me not And if she hate me not she will forgive And if she  now  forgive then will all be over and she will be mine upon my own terms And it shall then be the whole study of my future life to make her happy  So Belford thou seest that I have journeyed on to this stage indeed thro' infinite mazes and as infinite remorses with one determined point in view from the first To thy urgent supplication then that  I will do her grateful justice by marriage let me answer in Matt Prior's two lines on his hopedfor Auditorship as put into the mouths of his St John and Harley  Let that be done which Matt doth say  YEA  quoth the Earl  BUT NOT TODAY  Thou seest Jack that I make no resolutions however against doing her one time or other the wish'dfor justice even were I to succeed in my principal view  cohabitation  And of this I do assure thee that if I ever marry it must it shall be Miss Clarissa HarloweNor is her honour at all impaired with  me  by what she has  so far  suffered But the contrary She must only take care that if she be at last brought to forgive me she shew me that her Lovelace is the only man on earth whom she could have forgiven on the like occasion  But ah Jack what in the mean time shall I do with this admirable creature At present I am loth to say itBut at present she is quite stupefied  I had rather methinks she should have retained all her active powers tho' I had suffered by her nails and her teeth than that she should be sunk into such a state of absoluteinsensibility shall I call it as she has been in ever since Tuesday morning Yet as she begins a little to revive and nowandthen to call names and to exclaim I dread almost to engage with the anguish of a spirit that owes its extraordinary agitations to a niceness that has no example either in antient or modern story For after all what is there in her case that should  stupefy  such a glowing such a  blooming  charmerExcess of grief excess of terror has made a person's hair stand on end and even as we have read changed the colour of it But that it should so stupefy as to make a person at times insensible to those imaginary wrongs which would raise others  from  stupefaction is very surprising  But I will leave this subject lest it should make me too grave  I was yesterday at Hamstead and discharged all obligations there with no small applause I told them that the lady was now as happy as myself And that is no great untruth for I am not altogether so when I allow myself to  think  Mrs Townsend with her tars had not been then there I told them what I would have them say to her if she come  Well but after all How many  afterall's  have I I could be very grave were I to give way to itThe devil take me for a fool What's the matter with me I wonderI must breathe a fresher air for a few days  But what shall I do with this admirable creature the whileHang me if I know For if I stir the venomous spider of this habitation will want to set upon the charming fly whose silken wings are already so intangled in my enormous web that she cannot move hand or foot For so much has grief stupefied her that she is at present as destitute of will as she always seemed of desire I must not therefore think of leaving her yet for two days together  LETTER XXIX  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  I Have just now had a specimen of what this dear creature's resentment will be when quite recover'd An affecting oneFor entering her apartment after Dorcas and endeavouring to soothe and pacify her disordered mind in the midst of my blandishments she held up to Heaven in a speechless agony the innocent Licence which she has in her own power as the poor distressed Catalans held up their  English treaty on an occasion that keeps the worst of my actions in countenance  She seemed about to call down vengeance upon me when happily the Leaden God in pity to her trembling Lovelace waved over her halfdrowned eyes his somniferous wand and laid asleep the fair exclaimer before she could go half thro' with her intended imprecation  Thou wilt guess by what I have written that some  little  art has been made use of But it was with a  generous  design if thou'lt allow me the word on such an occasion in order to lessen the too quick sense she was likely to have of what she was to suffer A contrivance I never had occasion for before and had not thought of now if Mrs Sinclair had not proposed it to me To whom I left the management of it And I have done nothing but curse her ever since lest the quantity should have for ever damped her charming intellects  Hence my concernFor I think the poor lady ought not to have been so treated  Poor lady  did I sayWhat have I to do with thy creeping style But have not I the worst of it since her insensibility has made me but a thief to my own joys  I did not intend to tell thee of this little  innocent  trick for such I designed it to be but that I hate disingenuity To thee especially And as I cannot help writing in a more serious vein than usual thou wouldst perhaps had I not hinted the true cause have imagined that I was sorry for the fact itself And this would have given  thee  a good deal of trouble in scribbling dull persuasives to repair by matrimony and  me  in reading thy crude nonsense Besides one day or other thou mightest had I not confessed it have heard of it in an aggravated manner and I know thou hast such an high opinion of this lady's virtue that thou wouldst be disappointed i  thou hadst reason to think that she was subdued by  her own  consent or any the  least  yielding in her will And so is she beholden to me in some measure that at the expence of  my  honour she may so justly form a plea which will intirely salve  hers  And now is the whole secret out  Thou wilt say I am a horrid fellowAs the lady does that I am the  unchained Beelzebub  and a  plotting villain  And as this is what you both said beforehand and nothing worse  can  be said I desire if thou wouldst not have me quite serious with thee and that I should think thou meanest more by thy tiltinghint than I am willing to believe thou dost that thou wilt forbear thy invectives For is not the thing doneCan it be help'dAnd must I not now try to make the best of itAnd the rather do I injoin thee this and inviolable secrecy because I begin to think that my punishment will be greater than the fault were it to be only from my own reflection  LETTER XXX  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq    Friday June    I AM sorry to hear of thy misfortune but hope thou wilt not long lie by it Thy servant tells me what a narrow escape thou hadst with thy neck I wish it may not be ominous But I think thou seemest not to be in so enterprising a way as formerly and yet merry or sad thou seest a rake's neck is always in danger if not from the hangman from his own horse But 'tis a vicious toad it seems and I think thou shouldst never venture upon his back again for 'tis a plaguy thing for rider and horse both to be vicious  Thy fellow tells me thou desirest me to continue to write to thee to  divert  thy chagrin on thy forced  confinement But how I can think it in my  power  to divert when my subject is not pleasing to myself  Caesar never knew what it was to be  hyp'd  I will call it till he came to be what Pompey was that is to say till he arrived at the height of his ambition Nor did thy Lovelace know what it was to be gloomy till he had completed his wishes upon the charming'st creature in the world as the other did his upon the most potent republic that ever existed  And yet why say I  completed  when the  will  the  consent  is wantingAnd I have still views before me of obtaining that  Yet I could almost join with thee in the wish which thou sendest me up by thy servant unfriendly as it is that I had had thy misfortune before Monday night last For here the poor lady has run into a contrary extreme to that I told thee of in my last For now is she as much too lively as before she was too stupid and 'bating that she has pretty frequent lucid intervals would be deem'd raving mad and I should be obliged to confine her  I am most confoundedly disturb'd about it For I begin to fear that her intellects are irreparably hurt  Who the devil could have expected such strange effects from a cause so common and so slight  But these high soul'd and highsens'd girls who had set up for shining lights and examples to the rest of the sex I now see that such there are are with such difficulty brought down to the common standard that a wise man who prefers his peace of mind to his glory in subduing one of that exalted class would have nothing to say to them  I do all in my power to quiet her spirits when I force myself into her presence  I go on begging pardon one minute and vowing truth and honour another  I would at first have persuaded her and offer'd to  call witnesses to the truth of it that we were actually married Tho' the licence was in her hands I thought the assertion might go down in her disorder and charming consequences I hoped would follow But this would not do  I therefore gave up that hope And now I declare to her that it is my resolution to marry her the moment her uncle Harlowe informs me that he will grace the ceremony with his presence  But she believes nothing I say nor whether in her senses or not bears me with patience in her sight  I pity her with all my soul and I curse myself when she is in her wailing fits and when I apprehend that intellects so charming as hers are for ever damp'dBut more I curse these women who put me upon such an expedient Lord Lord what a hand have I made of itAnd all for what  Last night for the first time since Monday last she got to her pen and ink But she pursues her writing with such eagerness and hurry as shew too evidently her discomposure  I hope however that this employment will help to calm her spirits  JUST now Dorcas tells me that what she writes she tears and throws the paper in fragments under the table either as not knowing what she does or disliking it Then gets up wrings her hands weeps and shifts her seat all round the room Then returns to her table sits down and writes again  ONE odd letter as I may call it Dorcas has this moment given me from her  Carry this  said she  to the vilest of men  Dorcas a toad brought it without any further direction to  me  I sat down  intending tho' 'tis pretty long to give thee a copy of it But for my life I cannot 'tis so extravagant And the original is too much an original to let it go out of my hands  But some of the scraps and fragments as either torn thro' or flung aside I will copy for the novelty of the thing and to shew thee how her mind works now she is in this whimsical way Yet I know I am still furnishing thee with new weapons against myself But spare thy comments My own reflections render them needless Dorcas thinks her lady will ask for them So wishes to have them to lay again under her table  By the first thou'lt guess that I have told her that Miss Howe is very ill and can't write that she may account the better for not having received the letter designed for her  PAPER I  Torn in two pieces  My dearest Miss Howe  O What dreadful dreadful things have I to tell you  But yet I cannot tell you neither But say Are you really ill as a vile vile creature informs me you are  But he never yet told me truth and I hope has not in this And yet if it were not true surely I should have heard from you before nowBut what have I to do to upbraidYou may well be tired of me And if you are I can forgive you for I am tired of myself And all my own relations were tired of me long before you were  How good you have always been to me mine own dear Anna HoweBut how I ramble  I sat down to say a great dealMy heart was fullI did not know what to say firstAnd thought and grief and confusion and O my poor head I cannot tell whatAnd thought and grief and confusion came crouding so thick upon me  one  would be first  another  would be first  all  would be first so I can write nothing  at allOnly that whatever they have done to me I cannot tell but I am no longer what I was in any one thing In any one thing did I say Yes but I am for I am still and I ever will be  Your true  Plague on it I can write no more of this eloquent nonsense myself which rather shews a raised than a quenched imagination But Dorcas shall transcribe the others in separate papers as written by the whimsical charmer And some time hence when all is over and I can better bear to read them I may ask thee for a sight of them Preserve them therefore for we often look back with pleasure even upon the heaviest griefs when the cause of them is removed  PAPER II  Scratch'd thro' and thrown under the Table  AND can you my dear honoured papa resolve for ever to reprobate your poor child But I am sure you would not if you knew what she has suffered since her unhappyAnd will nobody plead for your poor suffering girlNo one good bodyWhy then dearest Sir let it be an act of your own innate goodness which I have so much experienced and so much abusedI don't presume to think you should receive meNo indeed my name isI don't know what my name isI never dare to wish to come into your family againBut your heavy curse my papaYes I  will  call you papa and help yourself as you canfor you are my own dear papa whether you will or notAnd tho' I am an unworthy childyet I  am  your child  PAPER III  A Lady took a great fancy to a young Lion or a Bear I forget whichbut a Bear or a Tyger I believe it was It was made her a present of when a whelp She fed it with her own hand She nursed up the wicked cub with great tenderness and would play with it without fear or apprehension of danger And it was obedient  to all her commands And its tameness as she used to boast increased with its growth so that like a lapdog it would follow her all over the house But mind what followed At last somehow neglecting to satisfy its hungry maw or having otherwise disobliged it on some occasion it resumed its nature and on a sudden fell upon her and tore her in piecesAnd who was most to blame I pray The brute or the lady The lady surely For what  she  did was  out  of nature  out  of character at least What  it  did was  in  its own nature  PAPER IV  HOW art thou now humbled in the dust thou proud Clarissa Harlowe Thou that never steppedst out of thy father's house but to be admired Who wert wont to turn thine eye sparkling with healthful life and selfassurance to different objects at once as thou passedst as if for so thy penetrating sister used to say to plume thyself upon the expected applauses of all that beheld thee Thou that usedst to go to rest satisfied with the adulations paid thee in the past day and couldst put off every thing but thy vanity  PAPER V  REjoice not now my Bella my sister my friend but pity the humbled creature whose foolish heart you used to say you beheld thro' the thin veil of humility which cover'd it  It must have been so My fall had not else been permitted  You penetrated my proud heart with the jealousy of an elder sister's searching eye  You knew me better than I knew myself  Hence your upbraidings and your chidings when I began to totter  But forgive now those vain triumphs of my heart  I thought poor proud wretch that I was that what you said was owing to your envy  I thought I could acquit my intention of any such vanity  I was too secure in the knowlege I thought I had of my own heart  My supposed advantages became a snare to me  And what now is the end of all  PAPER VI  WHAT now is become of the prospects of a happy life which once I thought opening before me Who now shall assist in the solemn preparations Who now shall provide the nuptial ornaments which soften and divert the apprehensions of the fearful virgin No court now to be paid to my smiles No encouraging compliments to inspire thee with hope of laying a mind not unworthy of thee under obligation No elevation now for conscious merit and applauded purity to look down from on a prostrate adorer and an admiring world and up to pleased and rejoicing parents and relations  PAPER VII  THOU pernicious caterpillar that preyest upon the fair leaf of virgin fame and poisonest those leaves which thou canst not devour  Thou fell blight thou eastern blast thou overspreading mildew that destroyest the early promises of the shining year that mockest the laborious toil and blastest the joyful hopes of the painful husbandman  Thou fretting moth that corruptest the fairest garment  Thou eating cankerworm that preyest upon the opening bud and turnest the damask rose into livid yellowness  If as Religion teaches us God will judge us in a great measure by our benevolent or evil actions to one anotherO wretch bethink thee in time bethink thee how great must be thy condemnation  PAPER VIII  AT first I saw something in your air and person that displeased me not Your birth and fortunes were no small advantages to youYou acted not ignobly by  my passionate brother Everybody said you were brave Everybody said you were generous A  brave  man I thought could not be a  base  man A  generous  man could not I believed be  ungenerous  where he acknowleged  obligation  Thus prepossessed all the rest that my soul loved and wished for in your reformation I hopedI knew not but by report any flagrant instances of your vileness You seemed frank as well as generous Frankness and generosity ever attracted me Whoever kept up those appearances I judged of their hearts by my own and whatever qualities  I wished  to find in them I was  ready  to find and  when  found I believed them to be natives of the soil  My Fortunes my Rank my Character I thought a further security I was in none of those respects unworthy of being the niece of Lord M and of his two noble sistersYour vows your imprecationsBut Oh you have barbarously and basely conspired against that honour which you ought to have protected And now you have made meWhat is it of vile that you have  not  made me  Yet God knows my heart I had no culpable inclinationsI honoured virtueI hated viceBut I knew not that you were vice itself  PAPER IX  HAD the happiness of any the poorest outcast in the world whom I had never seen never known never before heard of lain as much in  my  power as my happiness did in  yours  my benevolent heart would have made me fly to the succour of such a poor distressedWith what pleasure would I have raised the dejected head and comforted the desponding heartBut who now shall pity the poor wretch who has increased instead of diminished the number of the miserable  PAPER X  LEAD me where my own Thoughts themselves may lose me  Where I may doze out what I've left of Life  Forget myself and that day's guilt  Cruel remembrance how shall I appease thee  Oh you have done an act  That blots the face and blush of modesty  Takes off the rose  From the fair forehead of an innocent love  And makes a blister there  Then down I laid my head  Down on cold earth and for a while was dead  And my freed Soul to a strange somewhere fled  Ah sottish soul said I  When back to its cage again I saw it fly  Fool to resume her broken chain  And row the galley here again  Fool to that body to return  Where it condemn'd and destin'd is to  mourn  O my Miss Howe if thou hast friendship help me  And speak the words of peace to my divided soul  That wars within me  And raises ev'ry sense to my confusion  I'm tott'ring on the brink  Of peace and thou art all the hold I've left  Assist me in the pangs of my affliction  When honour's lost 'tis a relief to die  Death's but a sure retreat from infamy  Then farewel youth  And all the joys that dwell  With youth and life  And life itself farewel  For life can never be sincerely blest  Heaven punishes the  Bad  and proves the  Best  Death only can be dreadful to the bad  To innocence 'tis like a bugbear dress'd  To frighten children Pull but off the mask  And he'll appear a friend  I could a tale unfold  Would harrow up thy soul  By swift misfortunes  How am I pursu'd  Which on each other are  Like waves renew'd  AFTER all Belford I have just skimm'd over these transcriptions of Dorcas and I see there is method  and good sense in some of them wild as others of them are and that her memory which serves her so well for these poetical flights is far from being impair'd And this gives me hope that she will soon recover her charming intellectsTho' I shall be the sufferer by their restoration I make no doubt  But in the letter she wrote to me there are yet greater extravagancies and tho' I said It was too affecting to give thee a copy of it yet after I have let thee see the loose papers inclosed I think I may throw in a transcription of that Dorcas therefore shall here transcribe it  I  cannot The reading of it affected me ten times more than the severest reproaches of a regular mind  To Mr  LOVELACE  I Never intended to write another line to you I would not see you If I could help it O that I never had  But tell me of a truth Is Miss Howe really and truly illVery illAnd is not her illness poison And don't  you  know who gave it her  What you or Mrs Sinclair or somebody I cannot tell who have done to my poor head you best know But I shall never be what I was My head is gone I have wept away all my brain I believe for I can weep no more Indeed I have had my full share so it is no matter  But good now Lovelace don't set Mrs Sinclair upon me again I never did her any Harm She  so  affrights me when I see herEver sinceWhen was it I cannot tell  You  can I suppose She may be a good woman as far as I know She was the wife of a man of honourVery likelyTho' forced to let lodgings for her livelihood Poor gentlewoman Let her know I pity her But don't let her come near me againPray don't  Yet she may be a very good woman  What would I say I forget what I was going to say  O Lovelace you are Satan himself or he helps you out in every thing and that's as bad  But have you really and truly sold yourself to him▪ And for how long What duration is your reign to have  Poor man The contract  will  be out and then what will be your fate  Oh Lovelace if you could be sorry for yourself I would be sorry tooBut when all my doors are fast and nothing but the keyhole open and the key of late put into that to be where you are in a manner without opening any of themO wretched wretched Clarissa Harlowe  For I never will be Lovelacelet my uncle take it as he pleases  Well but now I remember what I was going to say It is for  your  goodnot  mine  For nothing can do me good nowO thou villainous man thou hated Lovelace  But Mrs Sinclair may be a good womanIf you love meBut that you don'tBut don't let her bluster up with her worse than mannish airs to me again O she is a frightful woman If she  be  a womanShe needed not to put on that  fearful mask  to scare me out of my poor wits But don't tell her what I sayI have no hatred to her It is only fright and foolish fear that's allShe may not  be  a bad womanBut neither are all  men  any more than all  women  alikeGod forbid they should be like you  Alas you have killed my head among youI don't say who did itGod forgive you allBut had it not been better to have put me out of all your ways at once You might safely have done it For nobody would require me at your handsNo not a soulExcept indeed Miss Howe would have said when she should see you What Lovelace have you done with Clarissa HarloweAnd then you could have given any slight gay answerSent her beyond sea or she has run away from me as she did from her parents And this would have been easily credited for you know Lovelace she that could run away from  them  might very well run away from  you  But this is nothing to what I wanted to say Now I have it  I have lost it againThis foolish wench comes teazing meFor what purpose should I eat For what end should I wish to liveI tell thee Dorcas I will neither eat nor drink I cannot be worse than I am  I will do as you'd have meGood Dorcas look not upon me so fiercelyBut thou canst not look so bad as I have seen somebody look  Mr Lovelace now that I remember what I took pen in hand to say let me hurry off my thoughts left I lose them againHere I am sensibleAnd yet I am hardly sensible neitherBut I know my head is not as it should be for all thatTherefore let me propose one thing to you It is for  your  goodnot  mine  And this is it  I must needs be both a trouble and an expence to you And here my uncle Harlowe when he knows how I am will never wish any man to have me No not even  you  who have been the occasion of itBarbarous and ungratefulA less complicated villainy cost a TarquinBut I forget what I would say again  Then this is it I never shall be myself again I have been a very wicked creaturea vain proud poor creaturefull of secret pridewhich I carried off under an humble guise and deceived everybodyMy sister says soAnd now I am punishedso let me be carried out of this house and out of your sight and let me be put into that Bedlam privately which once I saw But it was a sad sight to me then Little as I thought what I should come to  myself  That is all I would say This is all I have to wish forThen I shall be out of all your ways and I shall be taken care of and bread and water without your tormentings will be dainties and my straw bed the easiest I have lain inforI cannot tell how long  My cloaths will sell for what will keep me there perhaps as long as I shall live But Lovelace  dear  Lovelace I will call you for you have cost me enough▪ I'm suredon't let me be made a shew of for my  family  's sake nay for your  own sake  don't do that For when I know all I have suffer'd which yet I do no  and no matter if I never doI may be apt to rave again  you by name and tell of all your baseness to a poo  humbled creature that once was as proud as anybody But of what I can't tellExcept of my own folly and vanityBut let that passsince I am punished enough for it  So suppose instead of Bedlam it were a private madhouse where nobody comesThat will be better a great deal  But another thing Lovelace Don't let them use me cruelly when I am there  You  have used me cruelly enough you know Don't let them use me cruelly for I will be very tractable and do as anybody would have me do Except what you would have me dofor that I never will Another thing Lovelace Don't let this  good  woman I was going to say  vile  woman but don't tell her that Because she won't let you send me to this happy refuge perhaps if she were to know it  Another thing Lovelace And let me have pen and ink and paper allowed meIt will be all my amusementBut they need not send to anybody I shall write to what I write because it will but trouble them And somebody may do you a mischief maybeI wish not that anybody do anybody a mischief upon my account  You tell me that Lady Betty Lawrance and your cousin Montague were here to take leave of me but that I was asleep and could not be waked So you told me at first I was married you know and that you were my husbandAh Lovelace look to what you say But let not them for they will sport with my misery let not  that  Lady Betty let not  that  Miss Montague whatever the  real  ones may do nor Mrs Sinclair neither nor any of her lodgers nor her nieces come to see me in my place  Real  ones I say for Lovelace I shall find out all your villainies in timeIndeed I shallSo put me there as soon as you canIt is for  your  good Then all will pass for ravings that I can say as I doubt not many poor creatures exclamations do pass tho' there may be too much truth in them for all thatAnd you know  I began to be mad at Hamstead  So you saidAh villainous man what have you not to answer for  A little interval seems to be lent me I had begun to look over what I have written It is not fit for any one to see so far as I have been able to reperuse it But my head will not hold I doubt to go through it all If therefore I have not already mentioned my earnest desire let me tell you it is this That I be sent out of this abominable house without delay and lock'd up in some private madhouse about this town for such it seems there are never more to be seen or to be produced to anybody except in your own vindication if you should be charged with the murder of my person a much lighter crime than that of my honour which the greatest villain on earth has robbed me of And deny me not this my last request I beseech you and one other and that is Never to let me see you more This surely may be granted to  The miserably abused  CLARISSA HARLOWE  I WILL not hear thy heavy preachments upon this plaguy letter So not a word of that sort The paper thou'lt see is blister'd with the tears even of the harden'd transcriber which has made her ink run hereandthere  Mrs Sinclair is a true heroine and I think shames us all And she is a  woman  too Thou'lt say The best things corrupted become the worst But this is certain that whatever the sex set their hearts upon they make thorough work of it And hence it is that a mischief which would end in simple robbery among menrogues becomes murder if a woman be in it  I know thou wilt blame me for having had recourse to  art  But do not physicians prescribe opiates in acute cases where the violence of the disorder would be apt to throw the patient into a fever or delirium I averr that my motive for this expedient was  mercy  nor could it be any thing else For a Rape thou knowest to us Rakes is far from being an undesirable thing Nothing but the Law  stands in our way upon that account and the opinion of what a modest woman will suffer rather than become a  viva voce  accuser lessens much an honest fellow's apprehensions on that score Then if these  somnivolences  I hate the word  opiates  on this occasion have turned her head that is an effect they frequently have upon some constitutions and in this case was rather the fault of the dose than the design of the giver  But is not wine itself an opiate in degreeHow many women have been taken advantage of by wine and other still more intoxicating viandsLet me tell thee Jack that the  experience  of many of the  passive  sex and the  consciences  of many more of the  active  appealed to will testify that thy Lovelace is not the worst of villains Nor would I have thee put me upon clearing myself by comparisons  If she escape a settled delirium when my plots unravel I think it is all I ought to be concerned about What therefore I desire of thee is That if two constructions may be made of my actions thou wilt afford me the most favourable For this not only friendship but my own ingenuity which has furnished thee with the knowlege of the facts against which thou art so ready to inveigh require of thee  WILL is just returned from an errand to Hamstead and acquaints me that Mrs Townsend was yesterday at Mrs Moore's accompanied by three or four rough fellows She was strangely surprised at the news that my spouse and I are intirely reconciled and that two fine ladies my relations came to visit her and went to town with her Where she is very happy with me  She  was sure we were not married she said unless it was while we were at Hamstead And  they  were sure the ceremony was not performed there But that the Lady  is  happy and easy is  unquestionable And a fling was thrown out by Mrs Moore and Mrs Bevis at  mischiefmakers  as they knew Mrs Townsend to be acquainted with Miss Howe  Now since my Fairone can neither receive nor send away letters I am pretty easy as to this Mrs Townsend and her employer And I fancy Miss Howe will be puzzled to know what to think of the matter and afraid of sending by Wilson's conveyance and perhaps suppose that her friend slights her or has changed her mind in my favour and is ashamed to own it as she has not had an answer to what she wrote and will believe that the rustic d  livered her last letter into her own hand  Mean time I have a little project come into my head of a  new  kind just for amusementsake that's all Variety has irresistible charms I cannot live without intrigue My charmer has no passions that is to say none of the passions that I want her to have She engages all my reverence I am at present more inclined to regret what I have done than to proceed to new offences And shall regret it till I see how she takes it when recovered  Shall I tell thee my project 'Tis not a high one 'Tis thisTo get hither Mrs Moore Miss Rawlins and my Widow Bevis for they are desirous to make a visit to my spouse now we are so happy together And if I can order it right Belton Mowb  ay Tourville and I will shew them a little more of the ways of this wicked town than they at present know Why should they be  acquainted  with a man of my character and not be the  better  and  wiser  for itI would have everybody rail against rakes with  judgment  and  knowlege  if they  will  rail Two of these women gave me a great deal of trouble And the third I am confident will forgive a merry evening  I am really sick at heart for a frolick and have  no doubt but this will be an agreeable one These women already think me a wild fellow  nor do they like me the less for it  as I can perceive and I shall take care that they shall be treated with so much freedom before one another's faces that in policy they shall keep each other's counsel And won't this be doing a kind thing by them since it will knit an indissoluble band of union and friendship between three women who are neighbours and at present have only  common  obligations to one another For thou wantest not to be told that secrets of love and secrets of this nature are generally the strongest cement of female friendships  But after all if my Beloved should be happily restored to her intellects we may have scenes arise between us that will be sufficiently busy to employ all the faculties of thy friend without looking out for new occasions Already as I have often observed has she been the means of saving scores yet without her own knowlege  Sat Night  BY Dorcas's account of her Lady's behaviour the dear creature seems to be recovering I shall give the earliest notice of this to the worthy Captain Tomlinson that he may apprise uncle John of it I must be properly enabled from that quarter to pacify her or at least to rebate her first violence  LETTER XXXI  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq    Sunday Afternoon    o'Clock June    I WENT out early this morning and returned not till just now when I was informed that my Beloved in my absence had taken it into her head to attempt to get away  She tripp'd down with a parcel tied up in a handkerchief  her hood on and was actually in the entry when Mrs Sinclair saw her  Pray Madam whipping between her and the streetdoor be pleased to let me know whither you are going  Who has a right to controul me was the word  I have Madam by order of your spouse And kemboing her arms as she owned I desire you will be pleased to walk up again  She would have spoken but could not And bursting into tears turned back and went up to her chamber And Dorcas was taken to task for suffering her to be in the passage before she was seen  This shews as we hoped last night that she is recovering her charming intellects  Dorcas says she was visible to her but once before the whole day and then seemed very solemn and sedate  I will endeavour to see her It must be in her own chamber I suppose for she will hardly meet me in the diningroom What advantage will the confidence of our sex give me over the modesty of hers if she be recoverd  I  the most confident of men  She  the most delicate of women Sweet soul methinks I have have her before me Her face averted Speech lost in sighsAbash'dConsciousWhat a triumphant aspect will this give me when I gaze in her downcast countenance  THIS moment Dorcas tells me she believes she is coming to find me out She asked her after me And Dorcas left her drying her redswoln eyes at her glass No design of moving me by her tears sighing too sensibly for my courage But to what purpose have I gone thus far if I pursue not my principal end Niceness must be a little abated She knows the worst That she cannot fly me that she must see me and that I can look her into a sweet confusion  are circumstances greatly in my favour What can she do but rave and exclaim I am used to raving and exclaimingBut if recovered I shall see how she behaves upon this our first sensible interview after what she has suffered  Here she comes  LETTER XXXII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Sunday Night  NEVER blame me for giving way to have Art used with this admirable creature All the princes of the air or beneath it joining with me could never have subdued her while she had her senses  I will not anticipateOnly to tell thee that I am too much awaken'd by her to think of sleep were I to go to bed and so shall have nothing to do but to write an account of our odd conversation while it is so strong upon my mind that I can think of nothing else  She was dress'd in a white damask nightgown with less negligence than for some days past I was sitting with my pen in my fingers and stood up when I first saw her with great complaisance as if the day were still her own And so indeed it is  She entered with such dignity in her manner as struck me with great awe and prepared me for the poor figure I made in the subsequent conversation A poor figure indeedBut I will do her justice  She came up with quick steps pretty close to me a white handkerchief in her hand her eyes neither fierce nor mild but very earnest and a fix'd sedateness in her whole aspect which seemed to be the effect of deep contemplation And thus she accosted me with an air and action that I never saw equal'd  You see before you Sir the wretch whose preference of you to all your Sex you have rewardedas it indeed deserved to be rewarded My father's dreadful curse has already operated upon me in the very letter of it as to This life and it seems to me too evident that it will not be your fault that it is not intirely completed in the loss of my soul as well as of my honourWhich you villainous man have robbed me of with a baseness so unnatural so inhuman that it seems you even  you  had not the heart to attempt it till my senses were made the previous sacrifice  Here I made an hesitating effort to speak laying down my penBut she proceeded Hear me out guilty wretchabandon'd man  Man  did I say Yet what name else can I since the mortal worryings of the fiercest beast would have been more natural and infinitely more welcome than what you have acted by me and that with a premeditation and contrivance worthy only of that single heart which now  base  as well as ingrateful as thou art seems to quake within theeAnd well may'st thou quake well may'st thou tremble and falter and hesitate as thou dost when thou reflectest upon what I have suffer'd for thy sake and the returns thou hast made me  By my soul Belford my whole frame was shaken For not only her looks and her action but her voice so solemn was inexpressibly affecting And then my cursed guilt and her innocence and merit and rank and superiority of talents all stared me at that instant in the face so formidably that my present account to which she unexpectedly called me seemed as I then thought to resemble that general one to which we are told we shall be summoned when our conscience shall be our accuser  But she had had time to collect all the powers of her eloquence The whole day probably in her intellects And then I was the more disappointed as I had thought I could have gazed the dear creature into confusionBut it is plain that the sense she has of her wrongs sets this matchless woman  above all lesser all weaker  considerations  My dearMy loveIII neverNo never Lips trembling limbs quaking voice inward hesitating brokenNever surely did miscreant look so  like  a miscreant While thus she proceeded waving her snowy hand with all the graces of moving oratory  I have no pride in the confusion visible in thy whole person I have been all the day praying for a composure if I could not escape from this vile house that should once more enable me to look up to my destroyer with the consciousness of an innocent suffererThou seest me since my wrongs are beyond the power of  words to express  thou seest me  calm enough  to wish that thou mayst continue harassed by the workings of thy own conscience till effectual repentance take hold of thee that so thou mayst not forfeit all title to  that  mercy which thou hast not shewn to the poor creature now before thee who had so well deserved to meet with a faithful friend where she met with the worst of enemies  But tell me for no doubt thou hast  some  scheme to pursue Tell me since I am a prisoner as I find in the vilest of houses and have not a friend to protect or save me what thou intendest shall become of the remnant of a life not worth the keeping Tell me if yet there are more evils reserved for me and whether thou hast enter'd into a compact with the grand deceiver in the person of his horrid agent in this house and if the ruin of my soul that my father's curse may be fulfilled is to complete the triumphs of so vile a confederacyAnswer me  Say if thou hast courage to speak out to her whom thou hast ruined tell me what  further  I am to suffer from thy barbarity  She stopp'd here and sighing turn'd her sweet face from me drying up with her handkerchief those tears which she endeavour'd to restrain and when she could not to conceal from my sight  As I told thee I had prepared myself for high passions raving flying tearing execration These transient violences the workings of sudden grief and shame and vengeance would have set us upon a par with each other and quitted scores These have I been accustomed to and as nothing violent is lasting with these I could have wished to encounter But such a majestic composureSeeking me whom yet it is plain by her attempt to get away she would have avoided seeing No Lucretialike vengeance upon herself in her thoughtYet swallow'd up her whole mind swallow'd up as I may say by a grief so heavy as in her own words to be beyond the power of speech to expressand to be able discomposed as she was to the very morning to put such a homequestion to me as if she had penetrated my future viewHow could I avoid looking like a fool and answering as before in broken sentences and confusion  WhatWhataWhathas been doneI I I cannot but sayMust ownMust confessHem HemIs not rightIs not what should have been ButaButButI am trulytrulysorry for itUpon my soul I amAndAndwill do all do every thingDo whatWhatever is incumbent upon meall that youthat youthat you shall require to make you amends  O Belford Belford Whose the triumph now HERS or MINE  Amends O thou truly despicable wretchThen lifting up her eyesGood Heaven Who shall pity  the creature who could fall by so base a mind Yet and then she looked indignantly upon me Yet I hate thee not base and lowsoul'd as thou art half so much as I hate myself that I saw thee not sooner in thy proper coloursThat I hoped either morality gratitude or humanity from a libertine who to  be  a libertine must have got over and defied all moral sanctions  Her cousin Morden's words to her in his letter from Florence See Vol  iii  p      She then called upon her cousin Morden's name as if he had warned her against a man of free principles and walked towards the window her handkerchief at her eyes But turning short towards me with an air of mingled scorn and majesty  What at the moment would I have given never to have injured her  What amends hast  thou  to propose What amends can such a one as Thou make to a person of spirit or common sense for the evils thou hast so inhumanly made me suffer  As soon MadamAs soonasAs soon as your uncleornot waiting  Thou wouldst tell me I supposeI know what thou wouldst tell meBut thinkest thou that marriage will satisfy for a guilt like thine Destitute as thou hast made me both of friends and fortune I too much despise the wretch  who could rob himself of his wife's virtue  to endure the thoughts of thee in the light thou seemest to hope I will accept thee in  I hesitated an interruption But my meaning dy'd away upon my trembling lips I could only pronounce the word  marriage  And thus she proceeded  Let me therefore know whether I am to be controuled in the future disposal of myself Whether in a country of liberty as  this  where the Sovereign of it must not be guilty of  your  wickedness and where  you  neither durst have attempted it had I one friend or relation to look upon me I am to be kept  here a prisoner to sustain fresh injuries Whether in a word you intend to hinder me from going whither my destiny shall lead me  After a pause for I was still silent  Can you not answer me this plain question I quit all claim all expectation upon you What right have you to detain me here  I could not speak What could I say to such a question  O wretch wringing her uplifted hands had I not been robbed of my senses and that in the  basest  mannerYou best know howHad I been able to account for myself and your proceedings or to have known but how the days passed a whole week should not have gone over my head as I find it has done before I had told you what I now tell you  That the man who has been the villain to me you have been shall never make me his wife  I will write to my uncle to lay aside his kind intentions in my favourAll my prospects are shut in I give myself up for a lost creature as to this worldHinder me not from entering upon a life of severe penitence for corresponding after prohibition with a wretch who has too well justified all their warnings and inveteracy and for throwing myself into the power of your vile artificesLet me try to secure the only hope I hav  leftThis is all the amends I ask of you I repea  therefore Am I  now  at liberty to dispose of myse  as I please  Now comes the fool the miscreant again hes  +tating his broken answer My dearest love I am confounded quite confounded at the thought o  whatof what has been done and at the thoug  ofTo whom I see I see there is no withstan  +ing your eloquenceSuch irresistable proofs of t  love of virtue for its own sakedid I never hear o  nor meet with in all my reading And if you can fo  +give a repentant villain that thus on his knees i  +plores  your forgiveness Then down I dropt absolutely in earnest in all I said I vow by all that's Sacred and Just and a may a thunderbolt strike me dead at your feet if I am not sincere that I will by marriage before tomorrownoon without waiting for your uncle or anybody do you all the justice I now  can  do you And you shall ever after controul and direct me as you please till you have made me more worthy of your angelic purity than now I am Nor will I presume so much as to touch your garment till I have the honour to call so great a blessing lawfully mine  O thou guileful betrayer There is a just God whom thou invokest Yet the thunderbolt descends not and thou livest to imprecate and deceive  My dearest life rising for I hoped she was relenting  Hadst thou not sinned beyond the  possibility  of forgiveness interrupted she and had this been the first time that thus thou solemnly promisest and invokest the vengeance thou hast as often defied the desperateness of my condition might have induced me to think of taking a wretched chance with a man so profligate But  after what I have suffered by thee  it would be  criminal  in me to wish to bind my soul in covenant to a man so nearly ally'd to perdition  Good Godhow uncharitableI offer not to defendWould to Heaven that I could recall  So early ally'd to perdition  Madam So  profligate  a man Madam  O how short is expression of  thy  crimes and  my  fferingsSuch premeditation in thy baseness  o prostitute the characters of persons of honour of  y own familyAnd all to delude a poor creature  hom thou oughtest But why talk I to theeBe  y crimes upon thy headOnce more I ask thee  m I or am I not at my own liberty  now  I offer'd to speak in defence of the women declaring that they really were the very persons  Presume not interrupted she base as thou art to say one word in thine own vindication on this head I have been contemplating their behaviour their conversation their overready acquiescencies to my declarations in thy disfavour their free yet affectedly reserved light manners And now that the sad event has open'd my eyes and I have compared facts and passages together in the little interval that has been lent me I wonder I could not distinguish the behaviour of the unmatronlike jilt whom thou broughtest to betray me from the worthy lady whom thou hast the honour to call thy aunt And that I could not detect the superficial creature whom thou passedst upon me for the virtuous Miss Montague  Amazing uncharitableness in a lady so good herselfThat the high spirits those ladies were in to see  you  should subject them to such censuresI do most solemnly vow Madam  That they were interrupting me  verily  and  indeed  Lady Betty Lawrance and thy cousin Montague O wretch I see by thy solemn averrment  I had not yet averr'd it  what credit ought to be given to all the rest Had I no other proof  Interrupting her I besought her patient ear  I had found myself  I told her  almost  a vowedly  despised and hated I had no hope of gaining he  love or her confidence The letter she had left behind her on her removal to Hamstead sufficiently convinced me that she was intirely under Miss Howe's influence and waited but the return of a letter from her to enter upon measures that would deprive me of her for ever Miss Howe had  ever  been my  nemy More so  then  no doubt from the contents of the letter she had written to her on her fi  st coming to Hamstead That I dared not to stand the event of such a letter and was glad  of an opportunity by Lady Betty's and my cousin's means tho' they knew not my motive to get her back to town far at the  time  from  intending  the outrage which my despair and her want of confidence in me put me so vilely upon  I would have proceeded and particularly would have said something of Captain Tomlinson and her Uncle but she would not hear me further And indeed it was with visible indignation and not without several angry interruptions that she heard me say so much  Would I dare she asked me to offer at a palliation of my baseness The two women she was convinced were impostorsShe knew not but Captain Tomlinson and Mr Mennell were so too But whether  they  were so or not  I  was And she insisted upon being at her own disposal for the remainder of her short lifeFor indeed she abhorred me in every light and more particularly in that in which I offer'd myself to her acceptance  And saying this she flung from me leaving me absolutely shock'd and confounded at her part of a conversation which she began with such uncommon however severe composure and concluded with so much sincere and unaffected indignation  And now Jack I must address one serious paragraph  particularly  to thee  I have not yet touched upon cohabitationHer uncle's mediation she does not absolutely discredit as I had the pleasure to find by one hint in this conversationYet she suspects my future views and has doubts about Mennell and Tomlinson  I  do  say If she come  fairly  at her  lights  at her  clues  or what shall I call them her penetration is  wonderful  But if she do  not  come at them fairly  then  is her incredulity  then  is her antipathy to me evidently accounted for  I will speak outThou couldst not surely play me booty JackSurely thou couldst not let thy weak pity for  her  lead thee to an unpardonable breach of trust to thy  friend  who has been so unreserved in his communications to thee  I cannot believe thee capable of such a baseness Satisfy me however upon this head I must make a cursed figure in her eye vowing and protesting as I shall not scruple occasionally to vow and protest if all the time she has had unquestionable informations of my perfidyI know thou as little fearest me as I do thee in any point of manhood and wilt scorn to deny it if thou  hast  done it when thus home pressed  And here I have a good mind to stop and write no farther till I have thy answer  And so I will  Monday morn past three  LETTER XXXIII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Monday morn    o'clock June    I  Must  write on Nothing else can divert m  And I think thou canst not have been a dog to me  I would fain have closed my eyes But sleep  me Well says  Horace  as translated by  Cowley  The halcyon  Sleep  will never build his nest  In any stormy breast  'Tis not enough that he does find  Clouds  and  Darkness  in the mind  Darkness  but half his work will do  'Tis not enough He must find  Quiet  too  Now indeed do I from my heart wish that I h  never known this lady But who would have thoug  there had been such a woman in the world Of  the sex I have hitherto known or heard or read  it was  once subdued and always subdued  The  first  struggle was generally the  last  or at least the subsequent struggles were so much fainter and fainter that a man would rather have them than be without them But how know I yet  IT is now near sixThe sun has been illuminating for several hours every thing about me For that impartial orb shines upon mother Sinclair's house as well as upon any other But nothing within me can it illuminate  At daydawn I looked thro' the keyhole of my Beloved's door She had declared she would not put off her cloaths any more in this house There I beheld her in a sweet slumber which I hope will prove refreshing to her disturbed senses sitting in her elbowchair her apron over her head and that supported by one sweet hand the other hanging down upon her side in a sleepy lifelessness half of one pretty foot only visible  See the difference in our cases thought I She the charming injured can sweetly sleep while the varlet injurer cannot close his eyes and has been trying to no purpose the whole night to divert his melancholy and to fly from himself  As every vice generally brings on its own punishment even in  this  life if any thing were to tempt me to doubt of  future  punishment it would be that there can hardly be a greater than that which I at this instant experience in my own remorse  I hope it will go offIf not well will the dear creature be avenged for I shall be the most miserable or men  Six o' clock  JUST now Dorcas tells me that her lady is preparing openly and without disguise to be gone Very probable The humour she flew away from me  in last night has given me expectation of such an enterprize  Now Jack to be thus hated and despised And if I  have  sinned beyond forgiveness  BUT she has sent me a message by Dorcas that she will meet me in the diningroom and desires Odd enough that the wench may be present at the conversation that shall pass between us This message gives me hope  Nine o' clock  CONFOUNDED art cunning villainyBy my soul she had like to have slipt thro' my fingers She meant nothing by her message but to get Dorcas out of the way and a clear coast Is a fancied distress sufficient to justify this lady for dispensing with her principles Does she not shew me that she can wilfully deceive as well as I  Had she been in the forehouse and no passage t  go thro' to get at the streetdoor she had certainly been gone But her haste betray'd her For Sally Martin happening to be in the foreparlour and hearing a swifter motion than usual and a rustling  silks as if from somebody in a hurry looked out▪ and seeing who it was stept between her and th  door and set her back against it  You must not go Madam Indeed you must not  By what rightAnd how dare youAnd suc  like imperious airs the dear creature gave herself  While Sally called out for her aunt and half a doze  voices joined instantly in the cry for me to haste  down to hasten down in a moment  I was gravely instructing Dorcas abovestairs a  wondering what would be the subject of the co  +versation which she was to be a witness to when the outcries reached my ears And down I flewA  there was the charming creature the sweet deceive panting for breath her back against the partition  parcel in her hand Women make no excursions without their parcels Sally Polly but Polly obligingly pleading for her the Mother Mabell and Peter the footman of the house about her all however keeping their distance the Mother and Sally between her and the doorIn her soft rage the dear soul repeating I  will  goNobody has a rightI  will  go If you kill me women I won't go up again  As soon as she saw me she stept a pace or two towards me Mr Lovelace I  will  go said she Do you authorize these womenWhat right have they or  you  either to stop me  Is this my dear preparative to the conversation you led me to expect in the diningroom And do you think I can part with you thusDo you think I will  And am I Sir to be thus beset Surrounded thusWhat have these women to do with me  I desired them to leave us all but Dorcas who was down as soon as I I then thought it right to assume an air of resolution having found my tameness so greatly triumphed over And now my dear said I urging her reluctant feet be pleased to walk into the foreparlour Here since you will not go up stairsHere we may  hold our parley  and Dorcas  e witness to it  And now Madam seating her and sticking my hands in my sides your pleasure  Insolent villain said the furious lady And rising an to the window and threw up the sash She knew  ot I suppose that there were iron rails before the  indows And when she found she could not get  ut into the street clasping her uplifted hands toge  herhaving dropt her parcelFor the love of God  ood honest manFor the love of God mistress  two passersbya poor poor creature said she hin'd  I clasp'd her in my arms people beginning to gather  out the window And then she cried out Murder  Help helpAnd carried her up to the diningroom in spight of her little plotting heart as I may now cal  it altho' she violently struggled catching hold of the banisters here and there as she could I would have seated her there but she sunk down halfmotionless pale as ashes And a violent burst of tears happly reliev'd her  Dorcas wept over her The wench was actually moved for her  Violent hysterics succeeded I left her to Mabell Dorcas and Polly the latter the most supportable to her of the sisterhood  This attempt so resolutely made alarmed me not a little  Mrs Sinclair and her nymphs are much more concerned because of the reputation of their house as they call it having receiv'd some insults broken windows threaten'd to make them produce the young creature who cried out  While the mobbish inquisitors were in the heigh of their office the women came running up to me to know what they should do a constable bein  actually fetch'd  Get the constable into the parlour said I wi  three or four of the forwardest of the mob and pro+duce one of the nymphs onioney'd in a moment with disorder'd headdress and neckkerchief and le  her own herself the person The occasion a femal  skirmish but satisfied with the justice done her Th  give a dram or two to each fellow and all will be we  Eleven o'clock  ALL done as I advised and all  is  well  Mrs Sinclair wishes she never had seen the face  so skittish a lady and she and Sally are extreme  pressing with me to leave the perverse beauty to th  breaking  as they call it for four or five days B  I cursed them into silence only ordering doub  precaution for the future  Polly tho' she consoled the dear perverseone all she could when  with her  insists upon it  to me  that nothing but terror will procure me tolerable usage  Dorcas was challenged by the women upon her tears She own'd them real Said She was asham'd of herself but could not help it So sincere so  unyielding  a grief in so  sweet  a lady  The women laugh'd at her But I bid her make no apologies for her tears nor mind their laughing I was glad to see them  so ready  Good use might be made of such strangers In short I would have her indulge them often and try if it were not possible to  gain her lady's confidence by her concern for her  She said That her lady  did  take kind notice of them to her and was glad to see such tokens of humanity in her  Well then said I your  part  whether any thing come of it or not is to be  tenderhearted  It can do no harm if no good But take care you are not  too suddenly  or  too officiously  compassionate  So Dorcas will be a humane good sort of creature I believe very quickly with her lady And as it becomes women to be so and as my Beloved is willing to think highly of her own sex it will the more readily pass with her  I thought to have had one trial having gone so far for  cohabitation  But what hope can there be of succeedingShe is invincible Against all my notions against all my conceptions thinking of her as a woman and in the very bloom of her charms she is absolutely invincible My whole view at the present is to do her legal justice if I can but once more get her out of her altitudes  The  consent  of such a lady must make her ever new ever charming But astonishing Can the want of a church ceremony make such a difference  She  owes  me her consent for hitherto I have had nothing to boast of All of my side has been deep  remorse anguish of mind and love increased rather than abated  How her proud rejection stings meAnd yet I hope still to get her to listen to my stories of the familyreconciliation and of her Uncle and Capt Tomlinson And as she has given me a pretence to detain her against her will she  must  see me whether in temper or notShe cannot help it And if Love will not do Terror as the women advise must be tried  A nice part after all has my Beloved to act If she forgive me easily I resume perhaps my projects If she carry her rejection into violence that violence may make me desperate and occasion fresh violenceShe ought since she thinks she has found the women out to consider  where she is  I am confoundedly out of conceit with myself If I give up my contrivances my joy in stratagem and plot and invention I shall be but a common man Such another dull heavy creature as thyself Yet what does even my success in my machinations bring me but disgrace repentance regret But I a  overmatched egregiously overmatched by this lady What to do with her or without her I know not  LETTER XXXIV  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  I Have this moment intelligence from Simon Parso  one of Lord M's stewards that his Lordship is ve  ill Simon who is my obsequious servant in vir  of my presumptive heirship gives me a hint in  letter that my presence at MHall will not be am  So I must accelerate whatever be the course I sh  be allowed or compelled to take  No bad prospects for this charming creature the old peer would be so kind as to surrender a  many a summons has his gout given him A g    l  a year and perhaps the title reversiona  would help me up with her  Proudly as this lady pretends to be above all pride grandeur will have its charms with her for grandeur always makes a man's face shine in a woman's eye I have a pretty good because a clear estate as it is But what a noble variety of mischief will  l  a year enable a man to do  Perhaps thou'lt say I do  already  all that comes into my head But that's a mistake Not one half I will assure thee And even  good folks  as I have heard love to have the  power  of doing mischief whether they make  use of it  or  not  The late Queen Anne who was a very good woman was always fond of  prerogative  And her ministers in her name in more instances than one made a  ministerial  use of this her foible  BUT now at last am I to be admitted to the presence of my angry Fairone After three denials nevertheless and a  peremptory  from me by Dorcas that I must see her in her chamber if I cannot see her in the diningroom  Dorcas however tells me that she says If she were at her own liberty she would never see me more and that she has been asking after the characters and conditions of the neighbours I suppose now she has found her voice to call out for help from them if there were any to hear her  She will have it now it seems that I had the wickedness from the very beginning to contrive for her ruin a house so convenient for dreadful mischief  Dorcas begs of her to be pacifiedIntreats her to see me with patienceTells her that I am one of the most determin'd of men as she has heard say That gentleness may do with me but that nothing else will she believes And what as her ladyship as she always stiles her is  married  if I  had  broke my oath or  intended  to break it  She hinted plain enough to the honest wench that she was  not  marriedBut Dorcas would not understand her  This shews that she is resolv'd to keep no measures And now is to be a trial of skill whether she shall or not  Dorcas has hinted to her my Lord's illness as a piece of intelligence that dropped in conversation from me  But here I stop My Beloved pursuant to my peremptory message is just gone up into the diningroom  LETTER XXXV  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Monday afternoon June    PITY me Jack for pity's sake since if thou dost not nobody else will And yet never was there a man of my genius and lively temper that wanted it more We are apt to attribute to the devil everything that happens to us which we would not  have  happen But here being as perhaps thou'lt say the devil myself my plagues arise from an angel I suppose all mankind is to be plagu'd by its  contrary  She began with me like a true woman  She  in the fault  I  to be blamed the moment I enter'd the diningroom Not the least apology not the least excuse for the uproar she had made and the trouble she had given me  I come said she into thy detested presence because I cannot help it But why am I to be imprison'd here Altho' to no purpose I cannot help  Dearest Madam interrupted I give not way to so much violence You must know that your detention is intirely owing to the desire I have to make you all the amends that is in my power to make you And This as well for  your  sake as  my own  Surely there is still  one  way left to repair the wrongs you have suffer'd  Canst thou blot out the past week  Several  weeks  past I should say ever since I have been with thee Canst thou call back timeIf thou canst  Surely Madam again interrupting her If I may be permitted to call you  legally  mine I might have but anticip  Wretch that thou art Say not another word upon this subject When thou vowedst when thou promisedst at Hamstead I had begun to think that I must be thine If I had consented at the request of those I thought thy relations this would have been a principal inducement That I could then have brought thee what was  most  wanted an unsullied honour in dowry to a wretch destitute of all honour and could have met the gratulations of a family to which thy life has been one continued disgrace with a consciousness of  deserving  their gratulations But thinkest thou that I will give a harlotniece to thy honourable uncle and to thy  real  aunts and a cousin to thy cousins from a brothel For such in my opinion is this detested houseThen lifting up her clasped hands  Great and good God of Heaven said she give me patience to support myself under the weight of those afflictions which Thou for wise and good ends tho' at present impenetrable by me hast permitted  Then turning towards me who knew neither what to say  to  her nor  for  myself I renounce thee for ever LovelaceAbhorred of my soul for ever I renounce thee Seek thy fortunes wheresoever thou wilt Only now that thou hast already ruin'd me  Ruin'd you Madam The world need not I knew not what to say  Ruin'd me in my  own  eyes and that is the same to me as if  all the world  knew itHinder me not from going whither my mysterious destiny shall lead me  Why hesitate you Sir What right have you to  stop me as you lately did and to bring me up by force my hands and arms bruised with your violence What right have you to detain me here  I am cut to the heart Madam with invectives so violent I am but too sensible of the wrong I have done you or I could not  bear  your reproaches The man who perpetrates a villainy and resolves to go on with it shews not the compunction I shew Yet if you think yourself in my power I would caution you Madam not to make me desperate For you  shall  be mine or my life shall be the forfeit Nor is life worth having without you  Be  thine  I be  thine  said the passionate Beauty O how lovely in her violence  Yes Madam Be  mine  I repeat You  shall  be mine My very crime is your glory My love my admiration of you is increased by what has passed  And so it ought  I am willing Madam to court your returning favour But let me tell you were the house beset by a thousand armed men resolved to take you from me they should not effect their purpose while I had life  I never never will be yours said she clasping her hands together and lifting up her eyesI never will be yours  We may yet see many happy years Madam All your friends may be reconciled to you The treaty for that purpose is in greater forwardness than you imagine You know  better  than to think the  worse  of yourself for suffering what you  could not help  Injoin but the terms I can make my peace with you upon and I will instantly comply  Never never repeated she will I be yours  Only forgive me my dearest life this  one  time A virtue so invincible what further view  can  I have against youHave I attempted any further outrage If you will be mine your injuries will be injuries done to myself You have too well guessed at the  unnatural arts that have been used But can a greater testimony be given of your virtueAnd now I have only to hope that altho' I cannot make you  complete  amends yet that you will permit me to make you  all  the amends that can possibly be made  Hear me out I beseech you Madam for she was going to speak with an aspect unpacifiedly angry The God whom you serve requires but repentance and amendment Imitate  Him  my dearest love and bless me with the  means  of reforming a course of life that begins to be hateful to me  That  was  once  your favourite point Resume it dearest creature In charity to a soul as well as body which once as I flatter'd myself was  more  than indifferent to you resume it And let tomorrow's sun witness to our espousals  I  cannot judge thee said she but the GOD to whom thou so boldly referrest can and assure thyself  He  will But if compunction has  really  taken hold of thee if  indeed  thou art touched for thy ingrateful baseness and meanest any thing by pleading the holy example thou recommendest to my imitation in this thy pretended repentant moment let me sift thee thoroughly and by thy answer I shall judge of the sincerity of thy pretended declarations  Tell me then Is there any reality in the treaty thou hast pretended to be on foot between my Uncle and Captain Tomlinson and thyselfSay and hesitate not is there any truth in that storyBut remember if there be  not  and thou avowest that there  is  what further condemnation attends thy averrment if it be as solemn as I require it to be  This was a cursed thrust What could I say Surely this merciless lady is resolved to damn me thought I and yet accuses me of a design against her soulBut was I not obliged to proceed as I had begun  In short I solemnly averr'd that there was How one crime as the good folks say brings on another  I added That the Captain had been in town and would have waited on her had she not been indisposed That he went down much afflicted as well on her account as on that of her uncle tho' I had not acquainted him either with the nature of her disorder or the evertoberegretted occasion of it having told him that it was a violent fever That he had twice since by her uncle's desire sent up to inquire after her health And that I had already dispatched a man and horse with a letter to acquaint him and her uncle thro' him with her recovery making it my earnest request that he would renew his application to her uncle for the favour of his presence at the private celebration of our nuptials and that I expected an answer if not this night as tomorrow  Let me ask thee next said she Thou knowest the opinion I have of the women thou broughtest to me at Hamstead and who have seduced me hither to my ruin Let me ask thee If  really  and  truly  they were Lady Betty Lawrance and thy cousin MontagueWhat sayest thouHesitate notWhat sayest thou to this question  Astonishing my dear that you should suspect themBut knowing your strange opinion of them what can I say to be believed  And is  this  the answer thou returnest me Dost thou  thus  evade my question But let me know for I am trying thy sincerity now and shall judge of thy new professions by thy answer to this question Let me know I repeat whether those women be  really  Lady Betty Lawrance and thy cousin Montague  Let me my dearest love be enabled tomorrow to call you lawfully mine and we will set out the next day if you please to Berkshire to my Lord M's  where they both are at this time and you shall convince yourself by your own eyes and by your own ears which you will believe sooner than all I can say or swear  Now Belford I had really some apprehension of treachery from thee which made me so miserably evade for else I could  as  safely have sworn to the truth of this as to that of the former But she pressing me still for a categorical answer I ventur'd plumb and swore to it  Lovers oaths Jack  that they were really and truly Lady Betty Lawrance and my cousin Mont  gue  She lifted up her hands and eyesWhat can I thinkWhat  can  I think  You  think  me a devil Madam a very devil or you could no after you have put these questions to me seem to doubt the truth of answers so solemnly sworn to  And if I do think thee so have I not cause Is there another man in the world I hope for the sake of human nature there is not who could act by any poor friendless creature as thou hast acted by  me  whom thou hast  made  friendlessAnd who before I knew thee had for a friend every one who knew me  I told you Madam  before  that my aunt and cousin were actually here in order to take leave of you before they set out for Berkshire But the effects of my ingrateful crime such with shame and remorse I own it to be were the reason you could not see them Nor could I be fond that they should see  you  Since they never would have forgiven me had they known what had passedAnd what reason had I to expect your silence on the subject had you been recover'd  It signifies nothing now that the cause of their appearance has been answer'd in my ruin  who  or  what  they are But if thou hast averr'd thus solemnly  to two falshoods what a wretch do I see before me  I thought she had now reason to be satisfied and I begg'd her to allow me to talk to her of tomorrow as of the happiest day of my life We have the Licence MadamAnd you  must  excuse me that I cannot let you go hence till I have try'd every way I  can  try to obtain your forgiveness  And am I then with a kind of frantic wildness to be detained a prisoner in this horrid houseAm I SirTake careTake care holding up her hand menacing how you make me desperateIf I fall tho' by my own hand inquisition will be made for my blood And be not out in thy plot Lovelace if it  should  be soMake  sure  work I charge thee Dig a hole deep enough to cram in and conceal this unhappy body For depend upon it that some of those who will not stir to protect me living will move heaven and earth to avenge me dead  A horrid dear creatureBy my soul she made me shudder She had need indeed to talk of  her  unhappiness in falling into the hands of the only  man  in the world who could have used her as I have used her She is the only  woman  in the world who could have shock'd and disturb'd me as she has doneSo we are upon a foot in that respect And I think I have the  worst  of it by much Since very little has been my joy very much my trouble And  her  punishment as she calls it is  over  But when  mine  will or what it  may be  who can tell  Here only recapitulating think then how I must be affected at the time I was forced to leave off and sing a song to myself I aimed at a lively air but I croaked rather than sung And fell into the old dismal thirtieth of January strain I hemm'd up for a sprightlier note but it would not do And at last I ended like a malefactor in a dead psalmmelody  HighhoI gape like an unfledg'd kite in its nest wanting to swallow a chicken bobb'd at its mouth by its marauding dam  What a devil ails meI can neither think nor write  Lie down pen for a moment  LETTER XXXVI  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq    THERE is certainly a good deal in the observation  That it costs a man ten times more pains to be wicked than it would cost him to be good  What a confounded number of contrivances have I had recourse to in order to carry my point with this charming creature and after all how have I puzzled myself by it and yet am near tumbling into the pit which it was the end of all my plots to shun What a happy man had I been with such an excellence could I have brought my mind to marry when I first prevailed upon her to quit her father's house But  then  as I have often reflected how had I  known  that a but blossoming beauty who could carry on a private correspondence and run such risques with a notorious wild fellow was not prompted by inclination which one day might give such a free liver as myself as much pain to reflect upon as at the time it gave me pleasure Thou remembrest the Host's tale in Ariosto And  thy  experience as well as  mine  can furnish out twenty  Fiametto's  in proof of the imbecility of the sex  But to proceed with my narrative  The dear creature resumed the topic her heart was so firmly fixed upon and insisted upon quitting the  odious house  and that in very high terms  I urged her to meet me the next day at the altar in either of the two churches mentioned in the Licence  And I besought her whatever were her resolution to let me debate this matter calmly with her  If she said I would have her give what I desired the least moment's consideration I must not hinder her from being her own mistress To what purpose did I ask her  consent  if she had not a power over either her own person or actions  Will you give me your honour Madam if I consent to your quitting a house so disagreeable to you  My honour Sir said the dear creatureAlas And turned weeping from me with inimitable grace As if she had saidAlasYou have robb'd me of my honour  I hoped then that her angry passions were subsiding But I was mistaken For urging her warmly for the day and that for the sake of our mutual honour and the honour of both our families in this highflown and highsoul'd strain she answer'd me  And canst thou Lovelace be so  mean  as to wish to make a wife of the creature thou hast insulted dishonoured and abused as thou hast me Was it necessary to humble Clarissa Harlowe down to the low level of thy baseness before she could be a wife meet for thee Thou hadst a father who was a man of honour A mother who deserved a better sonThou hast an uncle who is no dishonour to the peerage of a kingdom whose peers are more respectable than the nobility of any other country Thou hast other relations also who may be  thy  boast tho' thou canst not be  theirs  And canst thou not imagine that thou hearest them calling upon thee the dead from their monuments the living from their laudable pride not to dishonour thy antient and splendid house by entering into wedlock with a creature whom thou hast levelled with the dirt of the street and classed with the vilest of her sex  I extoll'd her greatness of soul and her virtue I execrated myself for my guilt And told her how grateful to the  manes  of my ancestors as well as to the wishes of the living the honour I supplicated for would be  But still she insisted upon being a free agent of seeing herself in other lodgings before she would give what I urged the  least  consideration Nor would she promise me favour even then or to permit my visits How then as I asked her could I comply without resolving to lose her for ever  She put her hand to her forehead often as she talked and at last pleading disorder in her head retired neither of us satisfied with the other But  she  ten times more dissatisfied with me than I with her  Dorcas seems to be coming into favour with her  What nowWhat now  Monday Night  How determin'd is this ladyAgain had she like to have escaped usWhat a fixed resentment She only I find assumed a little calm in order to quiet suspicion She was got down and actually had unbolted the streetdoor before I could get to her alarmed as I was by Mrs Sinclair's cookmaid who was the only one that saw her fly thro' the passage Yet lightning was not quicker than I  Again I brought her back to the diningroom with infinite reluctance on her part And before her face ordered a servant to be placed constantly at the bottom of the stairs for the future  She seem'd even choak'd with grief and disappointment  Dorcas was exceedingly assiduous about her and confidently gave it as her own opinion that her dear lady should be permitted to go to another lodging since  this  was so disagreeable to her Were she  to be killed for saying so she would say it And was  good  Dorcas for this afterwards  But for some time the dear creature was all passion and violence  I see I see said she when I had brought her up what I am to expect from your new professions O vilest of men  Have I offered to you my beloved creature any thing that can justify this impatience after a more hopeful calm  She wrung her hands She disorder'd her headdress She tore her ruffles She was in a perfect phrensy  I dreaded her returning malady But intreaty rather exasperating I affected an angry airI bid her expect the worst she had to fearAnd was menacing on in hopes to intimidate her when dropping down at my feet  'Twill be a mercy said she the highest act of mercy you can do to kill me outright upon this spotThis happy spot as I will in my last moments call itThen baring with a still more frantic violence part of her inchanting neckHere here said the soulharrowing beauty let thy pointed mercy enter And I will thank thee and forgive thee for all the dreadful past With my latest gasp will I forgive and thank theeOr help  me  to the means and I will myself put out of thy way so miserable a wretch And bless thee for those means  Why all this extravagant passion why all these exclamations Have I offered any new injury to you my dearest life What a phrensy is this Am I not ready to m  ke you all the reparation that I  can  make you Had I not reason to hope  No no no nohalf a dozen times as fast as she could speak  Had I not reason to hope that you were meditating upon the means of making me happy and  yourself not miserable rather than upon a flight so causeless and so precipitate  No no no no as before shaking her head with wild impatience as resolved not to attend to what I said  My resolutions are so honourable if you will permit them to take effect that I need not be solicitous whither you go if you will but permit my visits and receive my vows And God is my witness that I bring you not back from the door with any view to your dishonour but the contrary And this moment I will send for a minister to put an end to all your doubts and fears  Say this and say a thousand times more and bind every word with a solemn appeal to that God whom thou art accustomed to invoke to the truth of the vilest falshoods and all will still be short of what thou  hast  vowed and promised to me And were  not  my heart to abhor thee and to rise against thee for thy  perjuries  as it  does  I would not I tell thee once more I would not bind my soul in covenant with such a man for a thousand worlds  Compose yourself however Madam for  your own sake  compose yourself Permit me to raise you up  abhorred  as I am of your soul  Nay if I must not touch you for she wildly  lap  my hands but with such a sweet passionate air her bosom heaving and throbbing as she looked up to me that altho' I was most sincerely enraged I could with transport have press'd her to mine  If I must not touch you I will notBut depend upon it and I assumed the sternest air I could assume to try what  that  would do depend upon it Madam that this is not the way to avoid the evils you dread Let me do what I will I cannot be used worseDorcas be gone  She arose Dorcas being about to withdraw and wildly caught hold of her arm O Dorcas If thou  art of mine own sex leave me not I charge thee Then quitting Dorcas down she threw herself upon her knees in the furthermost corner of the room clasping a chair with her face laid upon the bottom of itO where can I be safeWhere where can I be safe from this man of violence  This gave Dorcas an opportunity to confirm herself in her lady's confidence The wench threw herself at my feet while I seemed in violent wrath and embracing my knees Kill me Sir kill me Sir if you pleaseI must throw myself in your way to save my lady I beg your pardon SirBut you must be set onGod forgive the mischiefmakers But your own heart if left to itself would not permit these thingsSpare however Sir spare my lady I beseech you bustling on her knees about me as if I were intending to approach her lady had I not been restrained by her  This humour'd by me Begone devilOfficious devil begonestartled the dear creature who snatching up hastily her head from the chair and as hastily popping it down again in terror hit her nose I suppose against the edge of the chair and it gush'd out with blood running in a stream down her bosom she herself too much affrighted to heed it  Never was mortal man in such terror and agitation as I for I instantly concluded that she had stabb'd herself with some concealed instrument  I ran to her in a wild agonyFor Dorcas was frighted out of all her mock interposition  What have you doneO what have you done Look up to me my dearest lifeSweet injur'd innocence look up to me What have you done Long will I not survive youAnd I was upon the point of drawing my sword to dispatch myself when I discover'd What an unmanly blockhead does this charming creature make me at her pleasure  that all I apprehended was but a bloody nose which as far as I know for it could not be stopp'd in a quarter of an hour may have saved her head and her intellects  But I see by this scene that the sweet creature is but a pretty coward at bottom and that I can terrify her out of her virulence against me whenever I put on sternness and anger But then as a qualifier to the advantage this gives me over her I find myself to be a coward too which I had not before suspected since I was capable of being so easily terrified by the apprehensions of her offering violence to herself  LETTER XXXVII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  BUT with all this dear creature's resentment against me I cannot for my heart think but she will get all over and consent to enter the pale with me Were she even to die tomorrow and to know she should would not a woman of her sense of her punctilio and in her situation and of so proud a family rather die married than otherwise No doubt but she would altho' she were to hate the man ever so heartily If so there is now but one man in the world whom she can haveAnd that is  Me  Now I talk  familiar writing  is but  talking  Jack thus glibly of entering the pale thou wilt be ready to question me I know as to my intentions on this head  As much of my heart as I know of it myself will I tell theeWhen I am  from  her I cannot still help hesitating about marriage and I even frequently resolve against it and am resolved to press my favourite scheme for cohabitation But when I am  with  her I am ready to say to swear and to do  whatever I think will be most acceptable to her And were a parson at hand I should plunge at once no doubt of it into the state  I have frequently thought in  common  cases that it is happy for many giddy fellows There are giddy fellows as well as giddy girls Jack and perhaps  those  are as often drawn in as  these  that ceremony and parade are necessary to the irrevocable solemnity and that there is generally time for a man to recollect himself in the space between the heated overnight and the cooler next morning or I know not who could escape the sweet gypsies whose fascinating powers are so much aided by our own raised imaginations  A wife at any time  I used to say I had ever confidence and vanity enough to think that no woman breathing could deny her hand when I held out mine I am confoundedly mortified to find that this lady is able to hold me at bay and to refuse all my  honest  vows  What force allow me a serious reflection Jack▪ It  will  be put down What force have evil habits upon the human mind When we enter upon a devious course we think we shall have it in ou  power when we will to return to the right path▪ But it is not so I plainly see For who can acknowlege with more justice this dear creature's merits and his own errors than I Whose regret at times can be deeper than mine for the injurie  I have done her Whose resolutions to repair those injuries strongerYet how transitory is my penitenceHow am I hurried awayCanst thou te  by whatO devil of Youth and devil of Intrigue▪ how do ye mislead me How often do we en  in occasions for the deepest remorse what we begin in wantonness  At the present writing however the turn of the  scale is in favour of matrimonyFor I despair of carrying with her my favourite point  The lady tells Dorcas that her heart is broken and that she shall live but a little while I think nothing of that if we marry In the first place she knows not what a mind unapprehensive will do for her in a state to which all the sex look forward with high satisfaction How often have the whole sacred conclave been thus deceived in their choice of a pope not considering that the new dignity is of itself sufficient to give new life A few months heart'sease will give my charmer a quite different notion of things And I dare say as I have heretofore said  See p    of this Volume  once married and I am married for life  I will allow that her pride in  one  sense has suffered abasement But her triumph is the greater in every other And while I can think that all her trials are but additions to her honour and that I have laid the foundations of her glory in my own shame can I be called cruel if I am  not  affected with her grief as some men would be  And for what should her heart be broken Her will is unviolatedAt  present  however her will is unviolated The destroying of good habits and the introducing of bad to the corrupting of the whole heart is the violation That her will is not to be corrupted that her mind is not to be debased she has hitherto unquestionably proved And if she give cause for further trials and hold fast her integrity what  ideas  will she have to dwell upon that will be able to corrupt her moralsWhat  vestigia  what  remembrances  but such as will inspire abhorrence of the attempter  What nonsense then to suppose that such a mere notional violation as she has suffered should be able to cut asunder the strings of life  Her religion married or not married will set her above making such a trifling accident such an  involuntary  suffering f  tal to her  Such considerations as these they are that support me against all apprehension of bugbear consequences And I would have them have weight with thee who art such a doughty advocate for her And yet I allow thee this That she really makes too much of it Takes it too much to heart To be sure she ought to have forgot it by this time except the charming charming consequence happen that still I am in hopes will happen were I to proceed no further And if she apprehend this herself then has the dear overnice soul some reason for taking it so much to heart And yet would not I think refuse to legitimate  O Jack had I an imperial diadem I swear to thee that I would give it up even to my  enemy  to have one charming boy by this lady And should she  escape me  and no such effect follow my revenge on her family and in  such  a case on herself would be incomplete and I should reproach myself as long as I lived  Were I to be sure that this foundation is laid And why may I not hope it is I should not doubt to have her still should she withstand her day of grace on my own conditions Nor should I if it were so question that  revived  affection in  her  which a woman seldom fails to have for the father of her first child whether born in wedlock or out of it  And pr'ythee Jack see in this  aspiration  let me call it a distinction in my favour from other rakes who almost to a man follow their inclinations without troubling themselves about consequences In imitation as one would think of the strutting villain of a bird▪ which from feather'd lady to feather'd lady pursues his imperial pleasures leaving it to his  sleek paramours to hatch the genial product in holes and corners of their own finding out  LETTER XXXVIII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Tuesday Morn June    WELL Jack now are we upon another foot together This dear creature will not  let me be good  She is now authorizing all my plots by her own example  Thou must be partial in the highest degree if now thou blamest me for resuming my former schemes since in that case I shall but follow her clue No forced construction of her actions do I make on this occasion in order to justify a bad cause or a worse intention A little pretence indeed served the wolf when he had a mind to quarrel with the lamb but this is not now my case  For here Wouldst thou have thought it taking advantage of Dorcas's compassionate temper and of some warm expressions which the tenderhearted wench let fall against the cruelty of men and wishing to have it in her power to serve her has she given her the following Note signed by her maiden name For she has thought fit in positive and plain words to own to the pitying Dorcas that she is not married  Monday June    I The underwritten do hereby promise that on my coming into possession of my own estate I will provide for Dorcas Martindale in a gentlewomanlike manner in my own house Or if I do not soon obtain that possession or should first die I do hereby bind myself my executors and administrators to pay to her or her order during the term of her natural life the  sum of five pounds on each of the four usual quarterly days in the year that is to say twenty pounds by the year on condition that she faithfully assist me in my escape from an illegal confinement which I now labour under The first quarterly payment to commence aid be payable at the end of three months immediately following the day of my deliverance And I do also promise to give her as a testimony of my honour in the rest a diamond ring which I have shewed her Witness my hand this nineteenth day of June in the year abovewritten  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Now Jack what terms wouldst thou have me to keep with such a sweet corruptressSeest thou not how she hates meSeest thou not that she is resolved never to forgive meSeest thou not however that she must disgrace herself in the eye of the world if she actually should escapeThat she must be subjected to infinite distress and hazardFor whom has she to receive and protect herYet to determine to risque all these evilsAnd furthermore to stoop to artifice to be guilty of the reigning vice of the times of bribery and corruption O Jack Jack  say  not  write  not another word in her favour  Thou hast blamed me for bringing her to this house But had I carried her to any other in England where there would have been one servant or inmate capable either of  compassion  or  corruption  what must have been the consequence  But seest thou not however that in this flimsy contrivance the dear implacable like a drowning man catches at a straw to save herselfA straw shall she find to be the refuge she has resorted to  LETTER XXXIX  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq    Tuesday Morn    o'Clock  VERY illExceeding illas Dorcas tells me in order to avoid seeing meAnd yet the dear soul may be so in her  mind  But is not that equivocationSome one passion predominating in every human breast breaks thro' principle and controuls us all Mine is  love  and  revenge  taking turns Hers is  hatred  But this is my consolation that  hatred appeased is love begun  or  love renew'd  I may rather say if love ever had footing here  But  reflectioning  apart thou seest Jack that her plot is beginning to work Tomorrow it is to break out  I have been abroad to set on foot a plot of circumvention All fair now Belford  I insisted upon visiting my indisposed fair one Dorcas made officious excuses for her I cursed the wench in her hearing for her impertinence and stamp'd and made a clutterwhich was improved into an apprehension to the lady that I would have flung her faithful confidante from the top of the stairs to the bottom  He is a violent wretchBut Dorcas  dear  Dorcas now it is thou shalt have a friend in me to the last day of my life  And what now dost think the name of her  good angel  isWhy  Dorcas Martindale  Christian and super no more Wykes as in the promisory note in my formerAnd the dear creature has bound her to her by the  most solemn  obligations  besides  the tie of interest  Whither Madam do you design to go when you get out of this house  I will throw myself into the first open house I can find and beg protection till I can get a coach or a lodging in some honest family  What will you do for cloaths MadamI doubt you'll not be able to take any away with you but what you'll have on  O no matter for cloaths if I can but get out of this house  What will you do for money Madam I have heard his Honour express his concern that he could not prevail upon you to be obliged to him tho' he apprehended that you must be short of money  O I have rings and other valuables Indeed I have but four guineas and two of them I found lately wrapt up in a bit of lace designed for a charitable use But now alas Charity begins at home But I have one dear friend left if she be living as I hope in God she is to whom I can be obliged if I want O Dorcas I must ere now have heard from her if I had had fair play  Well Madam yours is a hard lot I pity you at my heart  Thank you Dorcas I am unhappy that I did not think  before  that I might have confided in thy pity and in thy sex  I pitied you Madam often and often But you were always as I thought diffident of me And then I doubted not but you were married and I thought his Honour was unkindly used by you So that I thought it my duty to wish well to his Honour rather than to what I thought to be your humours Madam Would to heaven that I had known before that you were not marriedSuch a lady Such a fortune To be so sadly betrayed  Ah Dorcas I was basely drawn in My youth My ignorance of the world And I have some things to reproach myself with when I look back  Lord Madam what deceitful creatures are these menNeither oaths nor vowsI am sure I am sureAnd then with her apron she gave her eyes half a dozen hearty rubsI may curse the time that I came into this house  Here was accounting for her bold eyes And was it not better to give up a house which her lady could not think worse of than she did in order to gain the reputation of sincerity than by offering to vindicate it to make her proffered services suspected  Poor DorcasBless me how little do we who have lived all our time in the country know of this wicked town  Had I  been able to write  cried the veteran wench I should certainly have given some other near relations I have in Wales a little  inkling  of matters and they would have saved me fromfromfrom  Her sobs were enough The apprehensions of women on such subjects are ever aforehand with speech  And then sobbing on she lifted her apron to her face again She shewed me how  Poor DorcasAgain wiping her own charming eyes  All love all compassion is this dear creature to every one in affliction but me  And would not an aunt protect her kinswoman Abominable wretch  I can'tI can'tI can'tsay my aunt was privy to it She gave me good advice She knew not for a great while that I wasthat I wasthat I was ughughugh  No more no more good Dorcas What a world we live inWhat a house am I in But  ome don't weep tho' she herself could not for  ear My being betrayed into it tho' to my own  may be a happy event for thee And if I live  shall  I thank you my good lady blubbering I am sorry very sorry you have had so hard a lot But it may be the saving of my soul if I can get to your ladyship's houseHad I but known that your ladyship was not married I would have eat my own flesh before before before  Dorcas sobb'd and wept The lady sighed and wept also  But now Jack for a serious reflection upon the premises  How will the good folks account for it that Satan has such faithful instruments and that the bond of wickedness is a stronger bond than the ties of virtue As if it were the nature of the human mind to be villainous For here had Dorcas been  good  and tempted as she was tempted to any thing  evil  I make no doubt but she would have yielded to the temptation  And cannot our fraternity in an hundred instances give proof of the like predominance of vice over virtue And that we have risqued more to serve and promote the interests of the former than ever a good man did to serve a good man or a good cause For have we not been prodigal of life and fortune Have we not defied the civil magistrate upon occasion and have we not attempted rescues and dared all things only to extricate a pounded profligate  Whence Jack can this be  O I have it I believe The vicious are as bad as they can be and do the devil's work without looking after while he is continually spreading snares for the others and like a skilful angler suit+ing his baits to the fish he angles for  Nor let even  honest  people  so called  blame po  Dorcas for her fidelity in a bad cause For does no  the  General  who implicitly serves an ambitious princ  in his unjust designs upon his neighbours or upo  his own oppressed subjects and even the  Lawyer  who for the sake of a paltry fee undertakes to whiten a black cause and to defend it against one he knows to be good do the very same thing as Dorcas And are they not both every whit as culpable Yet the one shall be dubbed a hero the other a charming fellow and be contended for by every client and his doublepaced abilities shall carry him thro' all the high preferments of the Law with reputation and applause  Well but what shall be done since the lady is so much determined on removingIs there no way to oblige her and yet to make the very act subservient to my own viewsI fancy such a way may be found out  I will study for it  Suppose I suffer her to make an escape Her heart is in it If she effect it the triumph she will have over me upon it will be a counterbalance for all she has suffered  I will oblige her if I can  LETTER XL  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  TIred with a succession of fatiguing days and sleepless nights and with contemplating the precarious situation I stand in with my Beloved I fell into a profound resverie which brought on sleep and that produced a dream a fortunate dream which as I imagine will afford my working mind the means to effect the obliging double purpose my heart is now once more set upon  What as I have often contemplated is the enjoyment of the finest woman in the world to the contrivance the bustle the surprizes and at last the happy conclusion of a welllaid plotThe charming  roundabouts  to come the  nearest way home    the doubts the apprehensions the heartakings the meditated triumphsThese are the joys that make the blessing dearFor all the rest what is it What but to find an angel in imagination dwindled down to a woman in factBut to my dream  Methought it was about nine on Wednesday morning that a chariot with a dowager's arms upon the doors and in it a grave matronly lady not unlike Mother H in the face but in her heart O how unlike stopp'd at a grocer's shop about ten doors on the other side of the way in order to buy some groceries And methought Dorcas having been out to see if the coast were clear for her lady's flight and if a coach were to be got near the place espied this chariot with the dowager's arms and this matronly lady And what methought did Dorcas that subtle traitress do but whip up to the old matronly lady and lifting up her voice say Good my Lady permit me one word with your Ladyship  What thou hast to say to me say on quoth the old lady the grocer retiring and standing aloof to give Dorcas leave to speak who methought in words like these accosted the lady  You seem Madam to be a very good lady and here in this neighbourhood at a house of no high repute is an innocent lady of rank and fortune beautiful as a May morning and youthful as a rosebud and full as sweet and lovely who has been trick'd thither by a wicked gentleman practised in the ways of the town and this very night will she be ruined if she get not out of his hands Now O Lady if you will extend your compassionate goodness to this fair young lady in whom the moment you behold her you will see cause to believe all I say and let her but have a place in your chariot and remain in your protection for one day only till she can send a man  and a horse to her rich and powerful friends you may save from ruin a lady who has no equal for virtue as well as beauty  Methought the old lady moved with Dorcas's story answered and said  Hasten O damsel who in a happy moment art come to put it in my power to serve the innocent and the virtuous which it has always been my delight to do Hasten to this young lady and bid her hie hither to me with all speed and tell her that my chariot shall be her asylum And if I find all that thou sayest true my house shall be her sanctuary and I will protect her from all her oppressors  Hereupon methought this traitress Dorcas hied back to the lady and made report of what she had done And methought the lady highly approved of Dorcas's proceeding and blessed her for her good thought  And I lifted up mine eyes and behold the lady issued out of the house and without looking back ran to the chariot with the dowager's coat upon it and was received by the matronly lady with open arms and  Welcome welcome welcome fair young lady who so well answer the description of the faithful damsel And I will carry you instantly to my house where you shall meet with all the good usage your heart can wish for till you can apprise your rich and powerful friends of your past dangers and present escape  Thank you thank you thank you thank you worthy thrice worthy lady who afford so kindly your protection to a most unhappy young creature who has been basely seduced and betrayed and brought to the very brink of destruction  Methought then the matronly lady who had by the time the young lady came to her bought and paid for the goods she wanted ordered her coachman to drive home with all speed who stopped not  till he had arrived in a certain street not far from Lincolnsinnfields where the matronly lady lived in a sumptuous dwelling replete with damsels who wrought curiously in muslins cambricks and fine linen and in every good work that industrious damsels love to be imployed about except the loom and the spinningwheel  And methought all the way the young lady and the old lady rode and after they came in till dinner was ready the young lady filled up the time with the dismal account of her wrongs and her sufferings the like of which was never heard by mortal ear and this in so moving a manner that the good old lady did nothing but weep and sigh and sob and inveigh against the arts of wicked men and against that abominable 'Squire Lovelace who was a  plotting villain  methought she said and more than that an  unchained Beelzebub  Methought I was in a dreadful agony when I found the lady had escaped and in my wrath had like to have slain Dorcas and our mother and every one I met But by some quick transition and strange metamorphosis which dreams do not usually account for methought all of a sudden this matronly lady was turned into the famous Mother H herself and being an old acquaintance of Mother Sinclair was prevailed upon to assist in my plot upon the young lady  Then methought followed a strange scene for Mother H longing to hear more of the young lady's story and night being come besought her to accept of a place in her own bed in order to have all the talk to themselves For methought two young nieces of hers had broken in upon them in the middle of the dismal tale  Accordingly going early to bed and the sad story being resumed with as great earnestness on one side as attention on the other before the young lady had  gone far in it Mother H methought was taken with a fit of the colic and her tortures increasing was obliged to rise to get a cordial she used to find specific in this disorder to which she was unhappily subject  Having thus risen and stept to her closet methought she let fall the wax taper in her returns and then O metamorphosis still stranger than the former What unaccountable things are dreams coming to bed again in the dark the young lady to her infinite astonishment grief and surprize found Mother H turned into a young person of the other sex And altho' Lovelace was the  abhorred of her soul  yet fearing it was some  other  person it was matter of some consolation to her when she found it was no other than himself and that she had been still the bedfellow of but one and the same man  A strange promiscuous huddle of adventures followed scenes perpetually shifting now nothing heard from the lady but sighs groans exclamations faintings dyingsFrom the gentleman but vows promises protestations disclaimers of purposes pursued and all the gentle and ungentle pressures of the lover's warfare  Then as quick as thought for dreams thou knowest confine not themselves to the rules of the drama ensued recoveries lyingsin christenings the smiling boy amply even in  her own  opinion rewarding the suffering mother  Then the grandfather's estate yielded up possession taken of itLiving very happily upon it Her beloved Norton her companion Miss Howe her visitor and admirable thrice admirable I enabled to  compare notes  with her a charming girl by the same father to her friend's charming boy who as they grow up in order to consolidate their mammas friendships for neither have dreams regard to  consanguinity  intermarry change names by act of  parliament to enjoy my estateand I know not what of the like incongruous stuff  I awoke as thou mayest believe in great disorder and rejoiced to find my charmer in the next room and Dorcas honest  Now thou wilt say this was a very odd dream And yet for I am a strange dreamer it is not altogether improbable that something like it may happen as the pretty simpleton has the weakness to confide in Dorcas whom till now she disliked  But I forgot to tell thee one part of my dream and that was That the next morning the lady gave way to such transports of grief and resentment that she was with difficulty diverted from making an attempt upon her own life But however at last was prevailed upon to resolve to live and to make the best of the matter A letter methought from Capt Tomlinson helping to pacify her written to apprise me that her uncle Harlowe would certainly be at Kentishtown on Wednesday night June the following day the th being his anniversary birthday and he doubly desirous on that account that our nuptials should be then privately solemnized in his presence  But  is  Thursday the th her uncle's anniversary methinks thou askestIt is or else the day of celebration should have been earlier still Three weeks ago I heard her say it was and I have down the birthday of every one of her family and the weddingday of her father and mother The minutest circumstances are often of great service in matters of the last importance  And what sayest thou now to my dream  Who says that sleeping and waking I have not fine helps from some  body  some  spirit  rather as thou'lt be apt to sayBut no wonder that a Beelzebub has his devilkins to attend his call  I can have no manner of doubt of succeeding in  Mother H's part of the scheme for will the lady who resolves to throw herself into the  first house she can enter  or to bespeak the protection of the  first person she meets  and who thinks there can be no danger  out  of this house equal to what she apprehends from Me  in  it scruple to accept of the chariot of a dowager accidentally offering And the lady's protection engaged by her faithful Dorcas so highly bribed to promote her escapeAnd then Mrs H has the air and appearance of a venerable matron and is not such a forbidding devil as Mrs Sinclair  The pretty simpleton knows nothing of the world nor that people who have money never want assistants in their views be they what they will How else could the princes of the earth be so implicitly served as they are change they hands ever so often and be their purposes ever so wicked  If I can but get her to  go on  with me till Wednesday next week we shall be settled together pretty quietly by that time And indeed if she has any gratitude and has in her the least of her sex's foibles she must think I deserve her favour by the pains she has cost me For dearly do they all love that men should take pains about them and for them  And here for the present I will lay down my pen and congratulate myself upon my happy invention since her obstinacy puts me once more upon exercising itBut with this resolution I think That if the present contrivance fail me I will exert all the faculties of my mind all my talents to procure for myself a legal right to her favour and that in defiance of all my antipathies to the married state and of the suggestions of the great devil out of the house and of his secret agents in itSince if  now  she is not to be prevailed upon or drawn in it will be in vain to attempt her further  LETTER XLI  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Tuesday night June    NO admittance yet to my charmer She is very ill in a violent fever Dorcas thinks Yet will have no advice  Dorcas tells her how much I am concerned at it  But again let me ask Does this lady do right to make herself ill when she is  not  ill For my own part libertine as people think me when I had  occasion  to be sick I took a dose of ipecacuanha that I might not be guilty of a falshood and most heartily sick was I as she who then pitied me full well knew But here to pretend to be very ill only to get an opportunity to run away in order to avoid forgiving a man who has offended her how unchristian If good folks allow themselves in these breaches of a known duty and in these presumptuous contrivances to deceive who Belford shall blame us  I have a strange notion that the matronly lady will be certainly at the grocer's shop at the hour of nine tomorrow morning For Dorcas heard me tell Mrs Sinclair that I shall go out at eight precisely and then she is to try for a coach And if the dowager's chariot should happen to be there how lucky will it be for my charmer How strangely will my dream be made out  I HAVE just received a letter from Captain Tomlinson Is it not wonderful For that was part of my dream  I shall always have a prodigious regard to dreams henceforward I know not but I may write a book upon that subject for my own experience will furnish out a great part of it  Glanville of Witches  and  Baxter's History of Spirits and Apparitions  and the Royal Insignificant's  Demonology  will be nothing at all to  Lovelace's Resveries  The letter is just what I dream'd it to be I am only concerned that uncle John's anniversary did not happen three or four days sooner for should any  new  misfortune befal my charmer she may not be able to support her spirits so long as till Thursday in the next week Yet it will give me the more time for new expedients should my present contrivance fail which I cannot however suppose  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Dear Sir  Monday June    I Can now return you joy for the joy you have given me as well as my dear friend Mr Harlowe in the news of his beloved niece's happy recovery for he is determined to comply with  her  wishes and  yours  and to give her to you with his own hand  As the ceremony has been necessarily delayed by reason of her illness and as Mr Harlowe's Birthday is on Thursday the th of this instant June when he enters into the seventyfourth year of his age and as time may be wanted to complete the dear lady's recovery he is very desirous that the marriage shall be solemnized upon it that he may afterwards have double joy on that day to the end of his life  For this purpose he intends to set out privately so as to be at Kentishtown on Wednesday se'nnight in the evening  All the family used he says to meet to celebrate it with him but as they are at present in too unhappy a situation for that he will give out that not being able to bear the day at home he has resolved to be absent for two or three days  He will set out on horseback attended only with one trusty servant for the greater privacy He will  be at the most creditablelooking public house there expecting you both next morning if he hear nothing from me to prevent him And he will go to town with you after the ceremony is performed in the coach he supposes you will come in  He is very desirous that I should be present on the occasion But this I have promised him at his request that I will be up before the day in order to see the settlements executed and every thing properly prepared  He is very glad that you have the licence ready  He speaks very kindly of you Mr Lovelace and says that if any of the family stand out after he has seen the ceremony performed he will separate from them and unite himself to his dear niece and her interests  I owned to you when in town that I took slight notice to my dear friend of the misunderstanding between you and his niece and that I did this for fear the lady should have shewn any little discontent in his presence were I to have been able to prevail upon him to go up in person as then was doubtful But I hope nothing of that discontent remains now  My absence when your messenger came must excuse me for not writing by him  Be pleased to make my most respectful compliments acceptable to the admirable lady and believe me to be  Your most faithful and obedient servant  ANTONY TOMLINSON  This letter I sealed and broke open It was brought thou mayst suppose by a particular messenger the seal such a one as the writer need not be ashamed of I took care to inquire after the Captain's health in my Beloved's hearing and it is now ready to be produced as a pacifier according as she shall  take on  or  resent  if the two metamorphoses  happen pursuant to my wonderful dream as having great faith in dreams I dare say they willI think it will not be amiss in changing my cloaths to have this letter of the worthy Captain lie in my Beloved's way  LETTER XLII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Wedn Noon June    WHAT shall I say nowI who but a few hours ago had such faith in dreams and had proposed out of hand to begin my treatise of  Dreamssleeping  and  Dreamswaking  and was pleasing myself with the dialoguings between the old matronly lady and the young lady and with the two metamorphoses absolutely assured that every thing would happen as my dream chalked it out shall never more depend upon those flying follies those illusions of a fancy depraved and run mad  Thus confoundedly have matters happened  I went out at eight o'clock in high good humour with myself in order to give the soughtfor opportunity to the plotting mistress and corrupted maid only ordering Will to keep a good lookout for fear his lady should mistrust my plot or mistake a hackneycoach for the dowagerlady's chariot But first I sent to know how she did and received for anwer Very illHad a very bad night Which latter was but too probable Since This  I  know that people who have plots in their heads as seldom  have  as  deserve  good ones  I desired a physician might be called in but was refused  I took a walk in St James's park congratulating myself all the way on my rare inventions Then impatient I took coach with one of the windows  quite  up the other  almost  up playing at bopeep at every  chariot I saw pass in my way to Lincolnsinnfields And when arrived there I sent the coachman to desire any one of Mother H's family to come to me to the coachside not doubting but I should have intelligence of my fair fugitive there it being then half an hour after ten  A servant came to me who gave me to understand that the matronly lady was just returned by herself in the chariot  Frighted out of my wits I alighted and heard from the Mother's own mouth that Dorcas had ingaged her to protect the lady but came to tell her afterwards that she had changed her mind and would not quit the house  Quite astonish'd not knowing what might have happen'd I order'd the coachman to lash away to our mother's  Arriving here in an instant the first word I ask'd was If the lady were safe  Mr Lovelace gives here a very circumstantial relation of all that passed between the Lady and Dorcas But as he could only guess at her motives for refusing to go off when Dorcas told her that she had engaged for her the protection of the dowager lady it is thought proper to omit his relation and to supply it by some  memoranda  of the Lady's But it is first necessary to account for the occasion on which those  memoranda  were made  The reader may remember that in the letter wrote to Miss Howe on her escape to Hamstead  See Vol  iv  p    she promises to give her the particulars of her flight at leisure  She had indeed thoughts of continuing her account of every thing that had passed between her and Mr Lovelace since her last narrative letter But the uncertainty she was in from that time with the execrable treatment she met with on her being deluded back again followed by a week's delirium had hitherto hindered her from prosecuting her intention But nevertheless having it still in her view to perform her promise as soon as she had opportunity she made minutes of every thing as it passed in order to help her memoryWhich as she observes in one place she could less trust to since her late disorders than before  In these minutes or book of  memoranda  she observes  That having apprehensions that Dorcas might be a traitress she would have got away while she was gone out to see for a coach and actually slid down stairs with that intent But that seeing Mrs Sinclair in the entry  whom Dorcas had planted there while she went out  she speeded up again unseen  She then went up to the diningroom and saw the letter of Captain Tomlinson On which she observes in her memorandumbook as follows  How am I puzzled nowHe might leave this letter on purpose None of the other papers left with it being of any consequence What's the alternativeTo stay and be the wife of the vilest of menHow my heart resists thatTo attempt to get off and fail ruin inevitable Dorcas  may  betray me I doubt she is  still  his implementAt his going out he whisper'd her as I saw unobservedIn a very familiar manner tooNever fear Sir with a courtesy  In her agreeing to connive at my escape she provided not for her own safety if I got away Yet had reason in that case to expect his vengeance and wants not forethoughtTo have taken her  with me  was to be in the power of her intelligence if a faithless creatureLet me however tho' I part not with my caution keep my charityCan there be any woman so vile to womanO yes Mrs Sinclair Her auntThe Lord deliver meBut alas I have put myself out of the course of his protection by the  natural  meansAnd am already ruin'dA father's curse likewise against meHaving made vain all my friends cautions and solicitudes I must not hope for miracles in my favour  If I do escape what may become of me a poor helpless deserted creatureHelpless from sexFrom circumstancesExposed to every dangerLord protect me  His vile man not gone with himLurking hereabouts no doubt "to watch my stepsI  will  not go away by the chariot however  That this chariot should come so opportunelySo like his many  opportunelies  That Dorcas should have the sudden thought Should have the  courage  with the thought to address a lady in behalf of an absolute stranger to that lady That the lady should so readily consentYet the transaction between them to take up so much time their distance in degree consider'd For arduous as the case was and precious as the time Dorcas was gone above half an hour Yet the chariot was said to be ready at a grocer's not many doors off  Indeed some elderly ladies are talkative And there are no doubt  some  good people in the world  But that it should chance to be a widow lady who could do what she pleased That Dorcas should know her to be so by the Lozenge Persons in her station not usually so knowing I believe in heraldry  Yet some mayFor servants are fond of deriving  collateral  honours and distinctions as I may call them from the quality or people of rank whom they serve  But his sly servant not gone with himThen this letter of Tomlinsons  Altho' I am resolved never to have this wretch yet may I not  throw myself into my uncle's protection at KentishTown or Highgate if I cannot escape before and so get clear of him  May not the evil I know be less than what I may fall into if I can avoid further villainy Further villainy he has not yet threatened freely and justly as I have treated him I will not go I think At least unless I can send this fellow out of the way  She tried to do this but was prevented by the fellow's pretending to put his ancle out by a slip down stairs  "A trick"  says his contriving master in his omitted relation  "I had learned him on a like occasion at Amiens      The fellow a villain The wench I doubt a vile wench At last concerned for her own safety Plays off and on about a coach  All my hopes of getting off at present over Unhappy creature to what further evils art thou reservedO how my heart rises at the necessity I must still be under to see and converse with so very vile a man    LETTER XLIII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Wednesday afternoon  DIsappointed in her meditated escapeobliged against her will to meet me in the diningroom and perhaps apprehensive of being upbraided for her art in feigning herself ill I  expected  that the dear perverse would  begin  with me with spirit and indignation But I was in hopes from the gentleness of her natural disposition from the consideration which I expected from her on her situation on the letter of Captain Tomlinson which Dorcas told me she had seen and from the time she had had to cool and reflect since she last admitted me to her presence that she would not have carried it so strongly thro' as she did  As I enter'd the diningroom I congratulated her and myself upon her  sudden  recovery And would have taken her hand with an air of respectful tenderness But she was resolved to begin where she left off  She turned from me drawing in her hand with a repulsing and indignant aspectI meet you once more said she because I cannot help it What  have you to say to me Why am I to be thus detained against my will  With the utmost solemnity of speech and behaviour I urged the ceremony I saw I had nothing else for itI had a letter in my pocket I said feeling for it altho' I had not taken it from the table where I left it and which we were then near the contents of which if attended to would make us both happy I had been loth to shew it to her before because I hoped to prevail upon her to be mine sooner than the day mentioned in it  I felt for it in all my pockets watching her eye mean time which I saw glance towards the table where it lay  I was uneasy that I could not find itAt last directed again by her sly eye I spied it on the table at the further end of the room  With joy I fetch'd it Be pleased to read that letter Madam with an air of satisfied assurance  She took it and cast her eye over it in such a careless way as made it evident that she had read it before And then unthankfully toss'd it into the windowseat before her  I urged her to bless me tomorrow or Friday morning At least that she would not render vain her uncle's journey and kind endeavours to bring about a reconciliation among us all  Among us all  repeated she with an air equally disdainful and incredulous O Lovelace thou art surely nearly allied to the grand deceiver in thy endeavour to suit temptations to inclinationsBut what honour what faith what veracity were it possible that I could enter into parley with thee on this subject which it is not may I expect from such a man as thou hast shewn thyself to be  I was touch'd to the quick A lady of your perfect character Madam who has feign'd herself sick on purpose to avoid seeing the man who adored her should  I know what thou wouldst say interrupted she Twenty and twenty low things that my soul would have been above being guilty of and which I have despised myself for have I been brought into by the infection of thy company and by the necessity thou hast laid me under of appearing mean But I thank God destitute as I am that I am not however sunk so low as to wish to be thine  I Madam as the injurer  ought  to have patience It is for the injured to reproach But your uncle is not in a plot against you it is to be hoped There are circumstances in the letter you have cast your eyes over  Again she interrupted me Why once more I ask thee am I detained in this house Do I not see myself surrounded by wretches who tho' they wear the habit of my sex may yet as far as I know lie in wait for my perdition  She would be very loth I said that Mrs Sinclair and her nieces should be called up to vindicate themselves and their house  Would but they kill me let them come and welcome I will bless the hand that will strike the blow indeed I will  'Tis idle very idle to talk of dying Mere younglady talk when controuled by those they hateBut let me beseech you dearest creature  Beseech me nothing Let me not be detained thus against my willUnhappy creature that I am said she in a kind of phrensy wringing her hands at the same time and turning from me her eyes lifted up Thy curse O my cruel father seems to be now in the height of its operationI am in the way of being a lost creature as to both worlds Blessed blessed God said she falling on her knees save me O save me from myself and from this man  I sunk down on my knees by her excessively affectedO that I could recall yesterday Forgive  me my dearest creature forgive what is past as it cannot now but by one way be retrieved Forgive me only on this conditionThat my future saith and honour  She interrupted me risingIf you mean to beg of me Never to seek to avenge myself by Law or by an appeal to my relations to my cousin Morden in particular when he comes to England  Dn the Law rising also She started and all those to whom you talk of appealing I defy both the one and the otherAll I beg is YOUR forgiveness and that you will on my unfeigned contrition reestablish me in your favour  O no no no lifting up her clasped hands I never never  will  never never  can  forgive you And it is a punishment worse than death to me that I am obliged to meet you or to see you  This is the last time my dearest life that you will ever see me in this posture on this occasion And again I kneeled to herLet me hope that you will be mine next Thursday your uncle's birthday if not before Would to Heaven I had never been a villain Your indignation is not cannot be greater than my remorseand I took hold of her gown for she was going from me  Be remorse thy portionFor thy own sake be remorse thy portion I never never will forgive theeI never never will be thineLet me retire Why kneelest thou to the wretch whom thou hast so vilely humbled  Say but dearest creature you will  consider  Say but you will take time to reflect upon what the honour of both our families require of you I will not rise I will not permit you to withdraw still holding her gown till you tell me you will  consider  Take this

more  than a  name  in virtue I now see that there is  Once subdued always subdued  'Tis an egregious falshood But Oh Jack she never  was subdued  What have I obtained but an increase of shame and confusionWhile her glory has been established by her sufferings  This one merit is however left me that I have laid her sex under obligations to me by putting this noble creature to trials which so gloriously supported have done honour to them all  But yetBut no more will I addWhat a force have evil habitsI will take an airing and try to fly from myselfDo not thou upbraid me on my weak fitsOn my contradictory purposesOn my irresolution And all will be well  LETTER XLIV  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Wednesday night  A Man is just now arrived from M Hall who tells me that my Lord is in a very dangerous way The gout in his stomach to an extreme degree occa  ion'd by drinking a great quantity of limonade  A man of  l  a year to prefer his appetite to  s health He deserves to die But we have all  f us our inordinate passions to gratifyAnd they  enerally bring their punishment along with them  o witnesses the nephew as well as the uncle  The fellow was sent up on other business but  retched his orders a little to make his court to a  uccessor  I am glad I was not at M Hall at the time my  ord took the grateful dose It was certainly grateful  him  at the time There are people in the world  o would have had the wickedness to say that I  d persuaded him to drink it  The man says that his Lordship was so bad when  he came away that the family began to talk of sending for me in posthaste As I know the old peer has a good deal of cash by him of which he seldom keeps account it behoves me to go down as soon as I can But what shall I do with this dear creature the whileTomorrow over I shall perhaps be able to answer my own question I am afraid she will make me desperate  For here have I sent to implore her company and am denied with scorn  I HAVE been so happy as to receive this moment a third letter from my dear correspondent Miss Howe A little severe devilIt would have broke the heart of my Beloved had it fallen into her hands I wil  inclose a copy of it Read it here  My dearest Miss Harlowe  Tuesday June  ▪  AGain I venture to write to you almost against inclination and that by your former conveyance little a  I like it  I know not how it is with you It may be bad an  then it would be hard to upbraid you for a silence yo  may not be able to help But if not what shall I say se+vere enough that you have not answered either of m  last letters The first  Vol  iv  p    of which and I think it im+ported you too much to be silent upon it you owned th  receipt of The other which was delivered into yo  own hands  See p    of this Volume  was so pressing for the favour of a  from you that I am amazed I could not be obliged  And still  more  that I have not heard from you since  The fellow made so strange a story of the condition  saw you in and of your speech to him that I know t  what to conclude from it Only that he is a simple bl  +dering and yet conceited fellow who aiming at descr  +tion and the rustic wonderful gives an air of bumki  romance to all he tells That this is his character y  will believe when you are informed that he describ  you in grief excessive  See p    to    of this Volume  yet so improved in your person and features and so  rosy  that was his word in your face and so flushcolour'd and so plump in your arms that one would conclude you were labouring under the operation of some malignant poison and so much the rather as he was introduced to you when you were upon a couch from which you offer'd not to rise or sit up  Upon my word Miss Harlowe I am greatly distressed upon your account for I must be so free as to say that in your ready return with your deceiver you have not at all answer'd my expectations nor acted up to your own character For Mrs Townsend tells me from the women at Hamstead how chearfully you put yourself into his hands again Yet at the time it was impossible you should be married  Lord my dear what pity it is that you took so much pains to get from the man But you know bestSometimes I think it could not be  you  to whom the rustic deliver'd my letter But it must too Yet it is strange I could not have one line by himNot oneAnd you so soon well enough to go with him back again  I am not sure that the letter I am now writing will come to your hands So shall not say half that I have upon my mind to say But if you think it  worth your while  to write to me pray let me know what fine ladies his relations those were who visited you at Hamstead and carried you back again so joyfully to a place that I had so fully warn'd you But I will say no more At least till I  know  more For I can do nothing but wonder and stand amazed  Notwithstanding all the man's baseness 'tis plain there was more than a lurking loveGood GodBut I have doneYet I know not how to have done neither Yet I mustI  will  Only account to me my dear for what I cannot at all account for And inform me whether you are really married or notAnd then I shall know Whether there  must  or must  not  be a period shorter than that of one of our lives to a friendship which has hitherto been the pride and boast of  Your  ANNA HOWE  DORCAS tells me that she has just now had a  searching  conversation as she calls it with her lady She is willing she tells the wench still to place a confidence in her Dorcas hopes she has reassured her but wishes me not to depend upon it Yet Captain Tomlinson's letter must assuredly weigh with her I sent it in just now by Dorcas desiring her to reperuse it And it was not returned me as I feared it would be And that's a good sign I think  I say  I think  and  I think  for this charming creature intangled as I am in my own inventions puzzles  me  ten thousand times more than I  her  LETTER XLV  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BBLFORD  Esq  Thursday noon June    LET me perish if I know what to make either of myself or of this surprising creature Now calm now tempestuous But I know thou lovest not anticipation any more than me  At my repeated requests she met me at six this morning She was ready dressed for she has not had her cloaths off ever since she declared that they never more should be off in this house And charmingly she looked with all the disadvantages of a three hours violent stomachach for Dorcas told me that she had been really ill no rest and eyes red and swell'd with weeping Strange to me that those charming fountains have not been long ago exhausted But she is a woman And I believe anatomists allow  that women have more watry heads than men  Well my dearest creature I hope you have now thoroughly consider'd of the contents of Captain Tomlinson's letter But as we are thus early met let me beseech you to make this my happy day  She looked not favourably upon me A cloud hung upon her brow at her entrance But as she was going  to answer me a still greater solemnity took possession of her charming features  Your air and your countenance my beloved creature are not propitious to me Let me beg of you before you speak to forbear all further recriminations For already I have such a sense of my vileness to you that I know not how to bear the reproaches of my own mind  I have been endeavouring said she since I am not permitted to avoid you after a composure which I never more expected to see you in How long I may enjoy it I cannot tell But I hope I shall be enabled to speak to you without that vehemence which I expressed yesterday and could not help it  The Lady in her minutes says "I fear Dorcas is a false one May I not be able to prevail upon him to leave me at my liberty Better to try than to trust to her If I cannot prevail but must meet him and my uncle I hope I shall have fortitude enough to renounce him then But I would fain avoid qualifying with the wretch or to give him an expectation which I intend not to answer If I am mistress of my own resolutions my uncle himself shall not prevail with me to bind my soul in covenant with so vile a man"    After a pause for I was all attention thus she proceeded  It easy for me Mr Lovelace to see that further violences are intended me if I comply not with your purposes whatever they are I will suppose them to be what you so solemnly profess they are But I have told you as solemnly my mind that I never  will  hat I never  can  be yours nor if so any man's upon earth All vengeance nevertheless for the wrongs you have done me I disclaim I want but to slide into some obscure corner to hide myself from you and from every one who once loved me The desire lately so near my heart of a reconciliation with my friends is much abated They shall not receive me  now  if they  would  Sunk in my own eyes I now think myself unworthy of their favour In the anguish of my soul therefore I conjure you Lovelace tears in her eyes to leave me to my fate In  doing so you will give me a pleasure the highest I now can know  Whither my dearest life  No matter whither I will leave to Providence when I am out of this house the direction of my future steps I am sensible enough of my destitute condition I know that I have not now a friend in the world Even Miss Howe has given me upor you areBut I would fain keep my temper By your means I have lost them allAnd you have been a barbarous enemy to me You know you have  She paused  I could not speak  The evils I have suffered proceeded she turning from me however irreparable are but  temporary  evils Leave me to my hopes of being enabled to obtain the Divine forgiveness for the offence I have been drawn in to give to my parents and to virtue that so I may avoid the evils that are  more than temporary  This is in now all I have to wish for And what is it that I demand that I have not a right to and from which it is an illegal violence to withhold me  It was impossible for me I told her plainly to comply I besought her to give me her hand as this very day I could not live without her I communicated to her my Lord's illness as a reason why I wish'd not to stay for her uncle's anniversary I besought her to bless me with her consent and after the ceremony was passed to accompany me down  Berks And thus my dearest life said I will yo  be freed from a house to which you have conceive  so great an antipathy  This thou wilt own was a princely offer And I was resolved to be as good as my word I though  I had kill'd my Conscience as I told thee Belford some time ago But Conscience I find tho' it ma  be temporarily stifled cannot die and when it da  not speak aloud will whisper And at this instant  I thought I felt the revived varletess on but a slight retrograde motion writhing round my pericardium like a serpent and in the action of a dying one collecting all its force into its head fix its plaguy fangs into my heart  She hesitated and looked down as if irresolute And this set my heart up at my mouth And believe me I had instantly popt in upon me in imagination an old spectacled parson with a white surplice thrown over a black habit A fit emblem of the halcyon office which under a benign appearance often introduces a life of storms and tempests whining and snuffling thro' his nose the irrevocable ceremony  I hope now my dear life said I snatching her hand and pressing it to my lips that your silence bodes me good Let me my beloved creature have but your tacit consent this moment to step out and engage a ministerAnd then I promised how much my whole future life should be devoted to her commands and that I would make her the best and tenderest of husbands  At last turning to me I have told you my mind Mr Lovelace said she Think you that I could thus solemnlyThere she stoptI am too much in your power proceeded she Your prisoner rather than a person free to choose for myself or to say what I will  do  or  be  But as a testimony that you mean me well let me instantly quit this house and I will then give you such an answer in writing as best befits my unhappy circumstances  And imaginest thou fairest thought I that this will go down with a Lovelace Thou oughtest to have known that freelivers like ministers of state never part with a power put into their hands without an equivalent of twice the value  I pleaded that if we joined hands  this morning  if not  tomorrow  if not on  Thursday  her uncle's birthday and in his presence and afterwards as I  had proposed set out for Berks we should of course quit this house and on our return to town should have in readiness the house I was in treaty for  She answer'd me not but with tears and sighs  Fond of believing what I hoped  I imputed her silence to the modesty of her sex The dear creature thought I solemnly as she began with me is ruminating in a sweet suspense how to put into fit words the gentle purposes of her condescending heart But looking in her averted face with a soothing gentleness I plainly perceived that it was resentment and not bashfulness that was struggling in her bosom  The Lady in her minutes owns the difficulty she lay under to keep her temper in this conference  But when I found says she that all my intreaties were ineffectual and that he was resolved to detain me I could no longer withhold my impatience    At last she broke silenceI have no patience said she to find myself a slave a prisoner in a vile house Tell me Sir in so many words tell me Whether it be or be not your intention to permit me to quit itTo permit me the freedom which is my birthright as an English subject  Will not the consequence of your departure hence be that I shall lose you for ever MadamAnd can I bear the thoughts of that  She flung from meMy soul disdains to hold parley with thee were her violent wordsBut I threw myself at her feet and took hold of her reluctant hand and began to imprecate to vow to promiseBut thus the passionate Beauty interrupting me went on  I am sick of thee MANOne continued string of vows oaths and protestations varied only by time and place fill thy mouthWhy detainest thou me My heart rises against thee O thou  cruel implement of my brother's causeless vengeance  All I beg of thee is that thou wilt remit me the future part of my father's dreadful curse The temporary part base and ingrateful as thou art thou hast completed  I was speechlessWell I mightHer  brother  's  implement  James Harlowe  's implement Zounds Jack what words were these  I let go her struggling hand She took two or three turns cross the room her whole haughty soul in her airThen approaching me but in silence turning from me and again to me in a milder voiceI see thy confusion Lovelace Or is it thy remorse I have but one request to make theeThe request so often repeated That thou wilt this moment permit me to quit this house Adieu then let me say for  ever  adieu And may'st thou enjoy that happiness in this world which thou hast robbed me of as thou hast of every friend I have in it  And saying this away she flung leaving me in a confusion so great that I knew not what to think say or do  But Dorcas soon roused me Do you know Sir I running in hastily that my lady is gone down stairs  No sureAnd down I flew and found her once more at the streetdoor contending with Polly Horton to get out  She rushed by me into the foreparlour and flew to the window and attempted once more to throw up the sashGood people Good people cried she  I caught her in my arms and lifted her from the window But being afraid of hurting the charming creature charming in her very rage she slid thro' my arms on the floor Let me die here Let me die here were her words remaining jointless and immoveable till Sally and Mrs Sinclair hurried in  She was visibly terrified at the sight of the old wretch while I sincerely affected appealed Bear witness Mrs SinclairBear witness Miss Martin Miss Horton Every one bear witness that I offer not violence to this beloved creature  She then found her feet O house looking towards the windows and all round her O house contrived on purpose for my ruin said sheBut let not  that woman come into my presenceNor that Miss Horton neither who would not have dared to controul me had she not been a base one  Hoh Sir Hoh Madam vociferated the old creature her arms kemboed and flourishing with one foot to the extent of her petticoatsWhat ado's here about nothingI never knew such work in my life betwen a chicken of a gentleman and a tyger of a lady  She was visibly affrighted And up stairs she hasten'd A bad woman is certainly Jack more terrible to her own sex than even a bad man  I follow'd her up She rushed by her own apartment into the diningroom No terror can make her forget her punctilio  To recite what passed there of invective exclamations threatenings even of her own life on one side of expostulations supplications and sometimes menaces on the other would be too affecting and after my particularity in like scenes these things may as well be imagined as expressed  I will therefore only mention that at length I extorted a concession from her She had reason  The Lady mentions in her memorandumbook that she had no other way as she apprehended to save herself from instant dishonour but by making this concession Her only hope now she says if she cannot escape by Dorcas's connivance whom nevertheless she suspects is to find a way to engage the protection of her uncle and even of the civil magistrate on Thursday next if necessary  He shall see she says tame and timid as he has thought her what she dare to do to avoid so hated a compulsion and a man capable of a baseness so premeditatedly vile and inhuman  to think it would have been worse for her on the spot if she had not made it It was  That she would endeavour to make herself easy till she saw what next Thursday her uncle's birthday would produce  But O that it were not a sin she passionately exclaimed on making this poor concession to put an end to her own life rather than yield to give me but  that  assurance  This however shews me that she is aware that the reluctantlygiven assurance may be fairly construed into a matrimonial expectation on my side And if she will  now  even  now  look forward I think from my heart that I will put on her livery and wear it for life  What a situation am I in with all my cursed inventions I am puzzled confounded and ashamed of myself upon the whole To take such pains to be a villain But for the  fiftieth  time let me ask thee Who would have thought that there had been such a woman in the worldNevertheless she had best take care that she carries not her obstinacy much further She knows not what revenge for slighted love will make me do  The busy scenes I have just passed thro' have given emotions to my heart which will not be quieted one while My heart I see on reperusing what I have written has communicated its tremors to my fingers and in some places the characters are so indistinct and unformed that thou'lt hardly be able to make them out But if one  half  of them only are intelligible that will be enough to expose me to thy contempt for the wretched hand I have made of my plots and contrivancesBut surely Jack I have gained some ground by this promise  And now one word to the assurances thou sendest me that thou hast not betrayed my secrets in relation to this charming creature Thou mightest have spared them Belford My suspicions held no longer than while I wrote about them  See p    of this Volume  For well I knew when I allowed myself time to think that thou hadst no  principles  no  virtue  to be misled by A great deal of strong envy and a little of weak pity I knew to be thy motives Thou couldst not provoke my anger and my compassion thou ever hadst and art  now more especially intitled to it beause thou art a  pityful  fellow  All thy new expostulations in my Beloved's behalf I will answer when I see thee  LETTER XLVI  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq    Thursday night  COnfoundedly out of humour with this perverse lady Nor wilt thou blame me if thou art my friend She regards the concession she made as a concession extorted from her And we are but just where we were before she made it  With great difficulty I prevailed upon her to favour me with her company for one halfhour this evening The necessity I was under to go down to M Hall was the subject I wanted to talk to her upon  I told her that as she had been so good as to promise that she would endeavour to make herself easy till she saw the Thursday in next week overI hoped that she would not scruple to oblige me with her word that I should find her here at my return from M Hall  Indeed she would make me no such promise Nothing of  this house  was mentioned to me said she You know it was not And do you think that I would have given  my consent to my imprisonment in it  I was plaguily nettled and disappointed too If I go not down to M Hall Madam you'll have no scruple to stay here I suppose till Thursday is over  If I cannot help myself I mustBut I insist upon being permitted to go out of this house whether you leave it or not  Well Madam then I will comply with your commands And I will go out this very evening in quest of lodgings that you shall have no objection to  I will have no lodgings of your providing SirI will go to Mrs Moore's at Hamstead  Mrs Moore's MadamI have no objection to Mrs Moore'sBut will you give me your promise to admit me there to your presence  As I do hereWhen I cannot help it  Very well MadamWill you be so good as to let me know what you intended by your promise to  make yourself easy    To  endeavour  Sir to make myself easywere the words  Till you saw what next Thursday would produce  Ask me no questions that may insnare me I am too sincere for the company I am in  Let me ask you Madam What meant you when you said  that were it not a sin you would die before you gave me that assurance  She was indignantly silent  You thought Madam you had given me room to hope your pardon by it  When I think I ought to answer you with patience I will speak  Do you think yourself in my power Madam  If I were notAnd there she stopt  Dearest creature speak outI beseech you dearest creature speak out  She was silent her charming face all in a glow  Have you Madam any reliance upon my honour  Still silent  You hate me Madam You despise me more than you do the most odious of God's creatures  You ought to despise me if I did not  You say Madam you are in a  bad  house You have  no reliance  upon my honourYou believe you  cannot avoid me    She arose I beseech you let me withdraw  I snatch'd her hand rising and press'd it first to my lips and then to my heart in wild disorder She might have felt the bounding mischief ready to burst its barsYou  shall  goTo your own apartment if  you pleaseBut by the great God of Heaven I will accompany you thither  She trembledPray pray Mr Lovelace don't terrify me so  Be seated Madam I beseech you be seated  I will sit down  Do then MadamDo thenAll my soul in my eyes and my heart's blood throbbing at my fingers ends  I willI willYou hurt mePray Mr Lovelace don'tdon't frighten me soAnd down she sat trembling my hand still grasping hers  I hung over her throbbing bosom and putting my other arm round her waistAnd you say you hate me Madam And you say you despise meAnd you say you promised me nothing  Yes yes I did promise youLet me not be held down thusYou see I sat down when you bid me Why struggling need you hold me down thus I did promise  to endeavour to be easy till Thursday was over  But you won't let me How can I be easy Pray let me not be thus terrified  And what Madam meant you by your promise Did you mean anything in my favour You designed that I should at the time  think  you did Did you mean any thing in my favour Madam Did you intend that I should  think  you did  Let go my hand SirTake away your arm from about me struggling yet trembling  Why do you gaze upon me so  Answer me MadamDid you mean any thing in my favour by your promise  Let me not be thus constrained to answer  Then pausing and gaining more spirit Let me go said she I am but a womanbut a weak woman But my life is in my own power tho' my person is notI will not be thus constrained  You shall not Madam quitting her hand bowing  but my heart at my mouth and hoping farther provocation  She arose and was hurrying away  I pursue you not MadamI will try your generosityStopReturnThis moment stop return if Madam you would not make me desperate  She stopt at the door burst into tears O LovelaceHow how have I deserved  Be  pleased  dearest angel to return  She came backBut with declared reluctance and imputing her compliance to terror  Terror Jack as I have heretofore found out tho' I have so little benefited by the discovery must be my resort if she make it necessary Nothing else will do with the inflexible charmer  She seated herself overagainst me extremely discomposedBut indignation had a visible predominance in her features  I was going towards her with a countenance intendedly changed to love and softness Sweetest dearest angel were my words in the tenderest accentBut rising up she insisted upon my being seated at distance from her  I obeyedand begged her hand over the table to my extended hand to see as I said if in any thing she would oblige me But nothing gentle soft or affectionate would do She refused me her hand Was she wise Jack to confirm to me that nothing but terror would do  Let me only know Madam if your promise to  endeavour  to wait with patience the event of next Thursday meant me favour  Do you expect any voluntary favour from one to whom you give not a free choice  Do you intend Madam to honour me with your hand in your uncle's presence or do you not  My heart and my hand shall never be separated  Why think you did I stand in opposition to the will of my best my natural friends  I know what you mean MadamAm I then as hateful to you as the vile Solmes  Ask me not such a question Mr Lovelace  I  must  be answered Am I as hateful to you as the vile Solmes  Why do you call Mr Solmes vile  Don't  you  think him so Madam  Why should I Did Mr Solmes ever do vilely by me  Dearest creature don't distract me by hateful comparisons And perhaps by a more hateful preference  Don't you Sir put questions to me that you know I will answer truly tho' my answer were ever so much to enrage you  My heart Madam my soul is all yours at present But you  must  give me hope that your promise in your own construction binds you no  new cause  to the contrary to be mine on Thursday How else can I leave you  Let me go to Hamstead and trust to my favour  May  I trust to itSay only  May  I trust to it  How will you trust to it if you extort an answer to this question  Say only dearest creature say only  may  I trust to your favour if you go to Hamstead  How  dare  you Sir if I must speak out expect a promise of favour from meWhat a mean creature must you think me after your ingrateful baseness to me were I to give you such a promise  Then standing up Thou hast made me O vilest of men her hands clasped and a face crimsoned over with indignation an inmate of the vilest of housesNevertheless while I am in it I shall have a heart incapable of any thing but abhorrence of  that  and of  thee  And round her looked the angel and upon me with fear in her sweet aspect of the consequence of her free declarationBut what a devil must I have been I who love bravery in a man had I not been more struck with admiration of her fortitude at the instant than stimulated by revenge  Noblest of creatures And do you think I can leave you and my interest in such an excellence precarious No promiseNo hopeIf you make me not desperate may lightning blast me if I do you not all the justice 'tis in my power to do you  If you have any intention to oblige me leave me at my own liberty and let me not be detained in this abominable house To be constrained as I have been constrained To be stopt by your vile agents To be brought up by force and to be bruised in my own defence against such illegal violenceI dare to die LovelaceAnd the person that fears not death is not to be intimidated into a meanness unworthy of her heart and principles  Wonderful creature But why Madam did you lead me to hope for something favourable for next ThursdayOnce more make me not desperate With all your magnanimity glorious creature I was more than half frantic Belford You  may  you  may  But do not do not make me brutally threaten youDo not do not make me desperate  My aspect I believe threatened still more than my words I was risingShe aroseMr Lovelace be pacifiedYou are even more dreadful than the Lovelace I have long dreadedLet me retireI ask your  leave  to retireYou really frighten meYet I give you no hopeFrom my heart I ab  Say not Madam you  abhor  me You must for your own sake conceal your hatred At least not avow itI seized her hand  Let me retire Let me retire said she in a manner out of breath  I will only say Madam that I refer myself to your generosity My heart is not to be trusted at this instant As a mark of my submission to your will you shall  if you please  withdrawBut I will not go to M HallLive or die my uncle I will not go to M HallBut will attend the effect of your promise Remember Madam you have promised  to endeavour to make yourself easy till you see the event of next Thursday  Next Thursday remember your uncle comes up to see us married  That's the event  You think ill of your Lovelace Do not Madam suffer your own morals to be degraded by the  infection  as you called it of his example  Away flew the charmer with this halfpermissionAnd no doubt thought that she had an escapenor without reason  I knew not for half an hour what to do with myself Vexed at the heart nevertheless now she was from me when I reflected upon her hatred of me and her defiances that I suffered myself to be so overawed checked restrained  And now I have written thus far having of course recollected the whole of our conversation I am more and more incensed against myself  But I will go down to these womenand perhaps suffer myself to be laugh'd at by them  Devil fetch them they pretend to know their own sex Sally was a woman well educatedPolly also Both have read Both have senseOf parentage not contemptibleOnce modest bothStill they say had been modest but for me Not intirely indelicate  now  tho' too little nice for my  personal  intimacy loth as they both are to have me think soThe old one too a woman of family tho' thus from bad inclination as well as at first from low circumstances miserably sunkAnd hence they all pretend to remember what  once  they were and vouch for the inclinations  and hypocrisy of the whole sex and wish for nothing so ardently as that I will leave the perverse lady to their management while I am gone to Berkshire undertaking absolutely for her humility and passiveness on my return and continually boasting of the many perverse creatures whom they have obliged to draw in their traces  They often upbraidingly tell me that they are sure I shall marry at lastAnd Sally the last time I was with her had the confidence to hint that when a wife some other person would not find half the difficulty that I had foundConfidence indeed But yet I must say That this dear creature is the only woman in the world of whom I should not be jealous And yet if a man gives himself up to the company of these devils they never let him rest till he either suspect or hate his wife  But a word or two of other matters if possible  Methinks I long to know how causes go at M Hall I have another private intimation that the old Peer is in the greatest danger  I must go down Yet what to do with this lady the mean whileThese cursed women are full of cruelty and enterprise She will never be easy with them in my absence They will have provocation and pretence therefore But woe be to them if  Yet what will vengeance do after an insult committed The two nymphs will have jealous rage  o goad them onAnd what will withhold a jealous and alreadyruined woman  To let her go elsewhere that cannot he done I am still resolved to be honest if she'll give me hope If yet she'll  let me  be honest But I'll see how she'll be after the contention she will certainly have between her resentment and the terror she had reason for from our last conversationSo let this subject rest till the morning And to the old Peer once more  I shall have a good deal of trouble I reckon tho' no sordid man to be decent on the expected occasion Then how to act I who am no hypocrite in the days of condolement What farces have I to go through and to be a principal actor in themI'll try to think of my own latter end a grey beard and a graceless heir in order to make me serious  Thou Belford knowest a good deal of this sort of grimace and canst help a gay heart to a little of the dismal But then every feature of thy face is cut out for it My heart may be touched perhaps sooner than thine for believe me or not I have a very tender oneBut then no man looking in my face be the occasion for grief ever so great will believe  that  heart to be deeply distressed  All is placid easy serene in my countenance Sorrow cannot sit half an hour together upon it Nay I believe that Lord M's recovery should it happen would not affect me above a quarter of an hour Only the new scenery and the pleasure of aping an Heraclitus to the family while I am a Democritus among my private friends or I want nothing that the old Peer can leave me Wherefore then should grief sadden and distort such blythe such jocund features as mine  But as for thine were there murder committed in the street and thou wert but passing by the murderer even in sight the pursuers would quit  him  and lay hold of  thee  And thy very looks would hang as well as apprehend thee  But one word to business Jack Whom dealtest thou with for thy blacksWert thou well used I shall want a plaguy parcel of them For I intend to make every soul of the family mourn  Outside  if not  In    LETTER XLVII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  June    Friday morning  I Went out early this morning on a design that I know not yet whether I shall or shall not pursue and on my return found Simon Parsons my Lord's Berkshire Bailiff just before arrived waiting for me with a message in form sent by all the family to press me to go down and that at my Lord's particular desire who wants to see me before he dies  Simon has brought my Lord's chariotandsix perhaps  my own  by this time to carry me down I have ordered it to be in readiness by four tomorrow morning The cattle shall smoke for the delay and by the rest they'll have in the interim will be better able to bear it  I am still resolved upon matrimony if my fair Perverse will accept of me But if she will not why then I must give an uninterrupted hearing not to my conscience but to these women below  Dorcas had acquainted her lady with Simon's arrival and errand My Beloved had desired to see him But my coming in prevented his attendance on her just as Dorcas was instructing him what questions he should not answer to that might be asked of him  I am to be admitted to her presence immediately at my repeated requestSurely the acquisition in view will help me to make all up with herShe is just gone up to the diningroom  NOTHING will do Jack I can procure no favour from her tho' she has obtained from me the point which she had set her heart upon  I will give thee a brief account of what passed between us  I first proposed instant marriage and this in the most fervent manner But was denied as fervently  Would she be pleased to assure me that she would stay here only till Tuesday morning I would but just go down and see how my Lord wasTo know whether he had any thing particular to say or injoin me while yet he was sensible as he was very earnest to see mePerhaps I might be up on Sunday Concede in something I beseech you Madam shew me some little consideration  Why Mr Lovelace must I be determined by your motionsThink you that I will voluntarily give a sanction to the imprisonment of my person Of what importance to me ought to be your stay or your return  Give a sanction to the imprisonment of your person  Do you think Madam that I fear the Law  I might have spared this foolish question of defianceBut my pride would not let me I thought she threatened me Jack  I  don't  think so Sir You are too  brave  to have any regard either to moral or divine sanctions  'Tis well Madam But ask me any thing I can do to oblige  you  and I  will  oblige you tho' in nothing will you oblige  me  Then I ask you then I request of you to let me go to Hamstead  I paused and at last By my soul you shall This very moment I will wait upon you and see you fixed there if you'll promise me your hand on Thursday in presence of your uncle  I want not  you  to see me fixedI will promise nothing  Take care Madam that you don't let me see that I can have no reliance upon your future favour  I have been used to be threatened by you Sir But I will accept of your company to Hamstead I will be ready to go in a quarter of an hourMy cloaths may be sent after me  You know the condition MadamNext Thursday  You dare not trust  My infinite demerits tell me that I  ought  not Nevertheless I  will  confide in your generosityTomorrow morning no  new cause  arising to give reason to the contrary as early as you please you may go to Hamstead  This seemed to oblige her But yet she looked with a face of doubt  I will go down to the women And having no better judges at hand will hear what they say upon my critical situation with this proud beauty who has so insolently rejected a Lovelace kneeling at her feet tho' making an earnest tender of himself for a husband in spite of all his prejudices to the state of shackles  LETTER XLVIII  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  JUST come from the women  Have I gone so far and am I afraid to go fartherHave I not already as it is evident by her behaviour sinned beyond forgivenessA woman's tears used to be to me but as water sprinkled on a glowing fire which gives it a fiercer and brighter blaze What defence has this lady but her tears and her eloquence She was before taken at  no weak  advantage She was  insensible  in her moments of trial  Had  she been sensible she  must  have been sensible So they say The methods taken with her have augmented her glory and her pride She has now a tale to tell that she  may  tell with honour to herself No accompliceinclination She can look me into confusion without being conscious of so much as a  thought  which she need to be ashamed of  This Jack the substance of my conference with the women  To which let me add that the dear creature now sees the necessity I am in to leave her Detecting me  is in her head My contrivances are of such a nature that I must appear to be the most odious of men if I am detected on this side matrimony And yet I have promised as thou seest that she shall set out to Hamstead as soon as she pleases in the morning and that without condition on her side  Dost thou ask What I meant by this promise  No  new cause  arising was the proviso on my side thou'lt remember But there  will be  a new cause  Suppose Dorcas should drop the promisorynote given her by her lady Servants especially those who cannot read or write are the most careless people in the world of written papers Suppose I take it up At a time too that I was determined that the dear creature should be her own mistress Will not this detection be a  new cause  A cause that will carry against her the appearance of ingratitude with it  That she designed it a  secret from me  argues a  fear of detection  and indirectly a  sense of guilt  I wanted a pretence Can I have a better If I am in a violent passion upon the detection is not passion an universally allowed extenuator of violence Is not every man and woman obliged to excuse that fault in another which at times they find attended with such ungovernable effects in themselves  The mother and sisterhood suppose brought to sit in judgment upon the vile corruptedThe least benefit that must accrue from the accidental discovery if not a pretence for  perpetration  which however may be the case an excuse for renewing my orders for her detention till my return from M Hall the fault her own and for keeping a stricter watch over her than before with direction to send me any letters that may be written  by  her or  to  her And when I return the devil's in it if I find not a way to make her choose lodgings for herself since these are so hateful to her that shall answer all my purposes  and yet no more appear to direct her choice than I did before in these  Thou wilt curse me when thou comest to this place I know thou wilt But thinkest thou that after such a series of contrivance I will lose this inimitable woman for want of a little more A Rake's a Rake JackAnd what Rake is withheld by  principle  from the perpetration of any evil his heart is set upon and in which he thinks he can succeed Besides am I not in earnest as to marriageWill not the generality of the world acquit me if I  do  marry And what is that injury which a  churchrite  will at any time repair Is not  the catastrophe of every story that ends in wedlock accounted happy  be the difficulties in the progress to it ever so great  But here how am I ingrossed by this lady while poor Lord M as Simon tells me lies groaning in the dreadfulest agonies What must he sufferHeaven relieve himI have a too compassionate heart And so would the dear creature have found could I have thought the worst of  her  sufferings equal to the lightest of  his  I mean as to fact for as to that part of hers which arises from extreme sensibility I know nothing of that and cannot therefore be answerable for it  LETTER XLIX  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  JUST come from my charmer She will not suffer me to say half the obliging the tender things which my honest heart is ready to overflow with A confounded situation that when a man finds himself in humour to be eloquent and pathetic at the same time yet cannot engage the mistress of his fate to lend an ear to his fine speeches  I can account now how it comes about that lovers when their mistresses are cruel run into solitude  and disburthen their minds to  stocks  and  stones  For am I not forced to make my complaints to  thee  She claimed the performance of my promise the moment she saw me of  permitting  her haughtily she spoke the word to go to Hamstead as soon as I were gone to Berks  Most chearfully I renewed it  She desired me to give orders in her hearing  I sent for Dorcas and Will They cameDo you both take notice But perhaps Sir I may take  you  with me that your lady is to be obeyed in all her commands She purposes to return to Hamstead as soon as I am goneMy dear will you not have a servant to attend you  I shall want no servant there  Will you take Dorcas  If I should want Dorcas I can send for her  Dorcas could not but say She should be very proud  Well well that may be at my return if your lady permitShall I my dear call up Mrs Sinclair and give her orders to the same effect in your hearing  I desire not to see Mrs Sinclair nor any that belong to her  As you please Madam  And then the servants being withdrawn I urged her again for the assurance that she would meet me at the altar on Thursday next But to no purpose May she not thank herself for all that may follow  One favour however I would not be denied to be admitted to pass the evening with her  All sweetness and obsequiousness will I be on this occasion My whole soul shall be poured out to move her to forgive me If she will not and if the promisorynote should fall in my way my revenge will doubtless take total possession of me  All the house in my interest and every one in it  not only engaging to intimidate and assist as occasion shall offer but staking all their experience upon my success if it be not my own fault what must be the consequence  This Jack however shall be her last trial and if she behave as nobly  in  and  after  this  second  attempt  all her senses about her  as she has done after the  first  she will come out an angel upon full proof in spite of man woman and devil Then shall there be an end of all her sufferings I will then renounce that vanquished devil and reform And if any vile machination start up presuming to mislead me I will sooner stab it in my heart as it rises than give way to it  A few hours will now decide all But whatever be the event I shall be too busy to write again till I get to M Hall  Mean time I am in strange agitations I must suppress them if possible before I venture into her presenceMy heart bounces my bosom from the table I will lay down my pen and wholly resign to its impulses  LETTER L  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Frid Night or rather Sat Morn    o'Clock  I Thought I should not have had either time or inclination to write another line before I got to M Hall But have the first must find the last since I can neither sleep nor do any thing but write if I can do that I am most  confoundedly  out of humour The reason let it follow if it will follow No preparation for it from me  I tried by gentleness and love to softenWhat Marble A heart incapable either of love or gentleness Her past injuries for ever in her head Ready to receive a favour the permission to go to Hamstead  but neither to deserve it nor return any So my scheme of the gentle kind was soon given over  I then wanted her to provoke me Like a coward boy who waits for the first blow before he can persuade himself to fight I half challeng'd her to challenge or defy me She seemed aware of her danger and would not directly brave my resentment But kept such a middle course that I neither could find a pretence to offend nor reason to hope yet she believed my tale that her uncle would come to Kentish Town and seemed not to apprehend that Tomlinson was an impostor  She was very uneasy upon the whole in my company Wanted often to break from me Yet so held me to my promise of permitting her to go to Hamstead that I knew not how to get off of it altho' it was impossible in my precarious situation with her to think of performing it  In this situation the women ready to assist and if I proceeded not as ready to ridicule me what had I left me but to pursue the concerted scheme and seek a pretence to quarrel with her in order to revoke my promised permission and to convince her that I would not be upbraided as the most brutal of ravishers for nothing  I had agreed with the women that if I could not find a pretence in her presence to begin my operations the note should lie in my way and I was to pick it up soon after her retiring from me But I began to doubt at near ten o'clock so earnest was she to leave me suspecting my overwarm behaviour to her and eager grasping of her hand two or three times with eyestrings as I felt on the strain while her eyes shewed uneasiness and apprehension that if she actually retired for the night it might be a chance whether it would be easy to come at her again Loth therefore to run such a risque I stept  out at a little after ten with intent to alter the preconcerted disposition a little saying I would attend her again instantly But as I returned I met her at the door intending to withdraw for the night I could not persuade her to go back Nor had I presence of mind so full of complaisancy as I was to her just before to stay her by force So she slid thro' my hands into her own apartment I had nothing to do therefore but to let my former concert take place  I should have premised but care not for order of time connexion or any thing else that between eight and nine o'clock in the evening another servant of Lord M's on horseback came to desire me to carry down with me Dr S my uncle having been once  in extremis  as they judge he is now relieved and reprieved by him I sent and engaged the Doctor to accompany me down and am to call upon him by four this morning Or the devil should have uncle and doctor if I'd stir till I got all made up  Poke thy damn'd nose forward into the event if thou wilt Curse me if thou shalt have it till its proper time and placeAnd too soon then  She had hardly got into her chamber but I found a little paper as I was going into mine which I took up and opening it for it was carefully pinn'd in another paper what should it be but a promisory note given as a bribe with a further promise of a diamond ring to induce Dorcas to favour her mistress's escape  How my temper chang'd in a momentRing ring ring ring my bell with a violence enough to break the string and as if the house were on fire  Every devil frighted into active life The whole house in an uproar Up runs WillSirSirSir Eyes goggling mouth distendedBid the damn'd  toad Dorcas come hither as I stood at the stairhead in a horrible rage and out of breath cry'd I  In sight came the trembling devilbut standing aloof from the report made her by Will of the passion I was in as well as from what she heard  Flash came out my sword immediately for I had it ready onCurs'd confounded villainous bribery and corruption  Up runs she to her lady's door screaming out for safety and protection  Good your honour interposed Will for God's sakeO Lord O Lordreceiving a good cuff  Take that varlet for saving the ingrateful  wretch  from my vengeance  Wretch  I  intended  to say but if it were some other word of like ending passion must be my excuse  Up ran two or three of the sisterhood What's the matter What's the matter  The matter  for still my beloved opened not her door on the contrary drew another bolt This  abominable  DorcasCall her aunt upLet her see what a traitress she has placed about meAnd let her bring the toad to answer for herself has taken a bribe a provision for life to betray her trust by that means to perpetuate a quarrel between a man and his wife and frustrate for ever all hopes of reconciliation between us  Let me perish Belford if I have patience to proceed with the farce  UP came the aunt puffing and blowingAs she hoped for mercy she was not privy to itShe never knew such a plotting perverse lady in her life Well might servants be at the pass they were when such ladies as Mrs Lovelace made no conscience of corrupting them For  her  part she desired no mercy  for the wretch No niece of hers if she were not faithful to her trustBut what was the proof  She was shewn the paper  But too evident Cursed cursed Toad Devil Jade passed from each mouthAnd the vileness of the  corrupted  and the unworthiness of the  corruptress  were inveighed against  Up we all went passing the lady's door into the diningroom to proceed to tryal  Stamp stamp stamp up each on her heels Rave rave rave every tongue  Bring up the creature before us all this instant  And would she have got out of the house say you  These the noises and the speeches as we clatter'd by the door of the fair briberess  Up was brought Dorcas whimpering between two both bawling outYou must go You shall go'Tis fit you should answer for yourself You are a discredit to all worthy servantsas they pulled and pushed her up stairsShe whining I cannot see his honourI cannot look so good and so generous a gentleman in the faceO how shall I bear my aunt's ravings  Come up and be dn'dBring her forward her imperial judgeWhat a plague it is the  detection  not the  crime  that confounds you You could be quiet enough for days together as I see by the date under the villainy Tell me ingrateful devil tell me who made the first advances  Ay disgrace to my family and blood cry'd the old oneTell his Honour Tell the truthWho m  de the first advances  Ay cursed creature cry'd Sally Who made the first advances  I have betrayed one trust alreadyO let me not betray anotherMy lady is a good ladyO let not  her  suffer  Tell all you know Tell the whole truth Dorcas  cry'd Polly HortonHis Honour loves his lady too well to make her suffer  much  little as she requites his love  Everybody sees that cry'd Sally Too well indeed  for  his Honour I was going to say  Till now I thought she deserved my love But to bribe a servant thus whom she supposed had orders to watch her steps for fear of another elopement and to impute that precaution to me as a crime Yet I must love herLadies forgive my weakness  Curse upon my grimacesIf I have patience to repeat themBut thou shalt have them all Thou canst not despise me more than I despise myself  BUT suppose Sir said Sally you have my lady and the wench face to face You see she cares not to confess  O my  carelessness  cry'd DorcasDon't let my poor lady sufferIndeed if you all knew what I know you would say Her ladyship has been cruelly treated  SeeSeeSeeSee repeatedly every one at onceOnly sorry for the  detection  as your Honour said Not the  fault    Cursed creature and devilish creature from every mouth  Your lady  won't  she  dare  not come out to save you cry'd Sally tho' it is more his Honour's mercy than your desert if he does not cut your vile throat this instant  Say repeated Polly was it your lady that made the first advances or was it you you creature  If the lady has so much honour bawl'd the mother excuse me  So  Excuse me SirConfound the old wretch she had like to have said  Son  If the lady has so much honour as we have supposed she will appear to vindicate a poor servant misled as she has been by such large promises  But I hope Sir you will do them  both  justice I  hope  you willGood lack Good lack clapping her hands together to grant her every thing she could ask To indulge her in her unworthy hatred to my poor innocent house To let her go to Hamstead tho' your Honour told us you could get no condescension from her no not the least O SirO SirI hopeI hopeIf your lady will not come outI hope you will find a way to hear this cause in her presence I value not my doors on such an occasion as this Justice I ever loved I desire you will come at the bottom of it in  clearance  to meI'll be sworn I had no privity in this black corruption  Just then we heard the lady's door unbar unlock unbolt  Now Sir  Now Mr Lovelace  Now Sir from every encouraging mouth  But O Jack Jack Jack I can write no more  IF you must have it all you must  Now Belford see us all sitting in judgment resolved to punish the fair briberessI and the mother the hitherto  dreaded  mother the nieces Sally Polly the traitress Dorcas and Mabell a guard as it were over her that she might not run away and hide herselfAll predetermined and of  necessity  predetermined from the journey I was going to take and my precarious situation with herAnd hear her  unbolt unlock unbar  the door then as it proved afterwards put the key into the lock on the outside lock the door and put it in her pocket Will I knew below who would give me notice if while we were all above she should mistake her way and go down stairs instead of coming into the diningroom the streetdoors also doubly secured and every  shutter to the windows round the house fastened that no noise or screaming should be heard Such was the brutal preparationAnd then  hear  her step towards us and instantly  see  her enter among us confiding in her own innocence and with a majesty in her person and manner that is  natural  to her but which then shone out in all its gloryEvery tongue silent every eye awed every heart quaking mine in a particular manner sunk throbless and twice below its usual region to once at my throat A shameful recreantShe silent too looking round her first on me then on the mother as no longer fearing her then on Sally Polly and the culprit DorcasSuch the glorious power of innocence exerted at that awful moment  She would have spoken but could not looking down my guilt into confusion A mouse might have been heard passing over the floor her own light feet and rustling silks could not have prevented it for she seemed to tread air and to be all soul She passed to the door and back towards me two or three times before speech could get the better of indignation and at last after twice or thrice hemming to recover her articulate voice O thou contemptible and abandoned Lovelace thinkest thou that I see not thro' this poor villainous plot of thine and of these thy wicked accomplices  Thou woman looking at the mother once my terror always my dislike but now my detestation▪ shouldest once more for thine perhaps was the preparation have provided for me intoxicating potions to rob me of my senses  And then  turning to me  Thou wretch mightest more securely have depended upon such a low contrivance as this  And ye vile women who perhaps have been the ruin body and soul of hundreds of innocents you shew me  how  in full assembly know that I am  not marriedruined as I am by your helps I bless God I am  not  married to this miscreantAnd I have friends that will demand my honour at your handsAnd to whose authority I will apply for none has this man over me Look to it then what further insults you offer me or incite him to offer me I am a person tho' thus vilely betrayed of rank and fortune I never will be his and to your utter ruin will find friends to pursue you And now I have this full proof of your detestable wickedness and have heard your base incitements will have no mercy upon you  They could not laugh at the poor figure I made Lord how every devil conscienceshaken trembled  What a dejection must ever fall to the lot of guilt were it given to innocence always thus to exert itself  And as for thee thou vile Dorcas Thou  double  deceiver whining out thy pretended love for me Begone wretch Nobody will hurt thee Begone I sayThou hast too well acted thy part to be blamed by  any  here but myself Thou art safe Thy guilt is thy security in such a house as thisThy shameful thy poor part thou hast as well acted as the low farce could give thee to act As well as they each of them thy superiors tho' not thy betters thou seest can act theirsSteal away into darkness No inquiry after this will be made whose the first advances thine or mine  And as I hope to live the wench confoundedly frightened slunk away so did her centinel Mabell tho' I endeavouring to rally cried out for Dorcas to stay But I believe the devil could not have stopt her when an angel bid her begone  Madam said I let me tell you and was advancing towards her with a fierce aspect most cursedly vexed and ashamed too  But she turned to me Stop where thou art O vilest and most abandoned of men Stop where thou art Nor with that determined face offer to touch me if thou wouldest not that I should be a corpse at thy feet  To my astonishment she held forth a penknife in her hand the point to her own bosom grasping resolutely the whole handle so that there was no offering to take it from her  I offer not mischief to anybody but myself You Sir and ye women are safe from every violence of mine The LAW shall be all my resource The LAW and she spoke the word with emphasis that to such people carries natural terror with it and now struck a panic into them  No wonder since those who will damn themselves to procure ease and plenty in this world will tremble at every thing that seems to threaten their methods of obtaining that ease and plenty  The LAW only shall be my refuge  The infamous mother whispered me that it were better to  make terms  with this  strange  lady and let her go  Sally notwithstanding all her impudent bravery at other times said  If  Mr Lovelace had told  them  what was  not true  of her being his wife  And Polly Horton That she must  needs  say the lady if she were  not  my wife had been very much injured that was all  That is not now a matter to be disputed cried I You and I know Madam  We do so said she and I thank God I am  not  thine  Once more  I thank God for it I have no doubt of the further baseness that thou hadst intended me by this vile and low trick But I have my SENSES Lovelace And from my heart I despise thee thou very poor Lovelace How canst thou stand in my presenceThou that  Madam Madam Madam These are insults not to be borne And was approaching her She withdrew to the door and set her back against it holding the pointed knife to her heaving bosom while the women held me beseeching me not to provoke the violent ladyFor their  house  sake and be curs'd to them they besought meand all three hung upon meWhile the truly heroic lady braved me at that distance  Approach me Lovelace with resentment if thou wilt I dare die It is in defence of my honour God will be merciful to my poor soulI expect no mercy from thee I have gained this distance and two steps nearer me and thou shalt see what I dare do  Leave me women to myself and to my angel They retired at a distanceO my beloved creature how you terrify meHolding out my arms and kneeling on one kneeNot a step not a step further except to receive the death myself at that injured hand that threatens its ownI am a villain the blackest or villainsSay you will sheath your knife in the injurer's not the injured's heart and then will I indeed approach you but not else  The mother twang'd her damn'd nose and Sally and Polly pulled out their handkerchiefs and turned from us They never in their lives they told me afterwards beheld such a scene  Innocence so triumphant Villainy so debased they must mean  Unawares to myself I had moved onward to my angel And dost thou dost thou  still  disclaiming  still  advancingDost thou dost thou  still  insidiously move towards me and her hand was extended I dareI dareNot rashly neitherMy heart from  principle  abhors the act which  thou  makest  necessary  God in thy mercy Lifting up her eyes and handsGod in thy mercy  I threw myself to the further end of the room An ejaculation a silent ejaculation employing her thoughts that moment Polly says the whites of her lovely eyes were only visible And in the instant that she extended her hand  assuredly  to strike the fatal blow How the very recital tumults me she cast her eye towards me and saw me at the utmost distance the room would allow and heard my broken voice My voice was utterly broken nor knew I what I said or whether to the purpose or not And her charming cheeks that were all in a glow before turned pale as if terrified at her own purpose and lifting up her eyesThank GodThank God said the angel Deliver'd  for the present  for the  present  deliver'd from myself Keep Sir keep that distance looking down towards me who was prostrate on the floor my heart pierced as with an hundred daggers That distance has saved a life to what reserved the Almighty only knows  To  be  happy Madam and to  make  happy And O let me but hope for your favour for tomorrowI will put off my journey till then And may God  Swear not Sir With an awful and piercing aspectYou have tootoo often swornGod's eye is upon us His more  immediate  eye and looked wildly But the women looked up to the ceiling and trembled as if  afraid  of God's eye And well they might and  I  too who so very lately had each of us the devil in our hearts  If not tomorrow Madam say but next Thursday your uncle's birthday say but next Thursday  This I say of This you may assure yourself I never never  will  be yours And let me hope that I may be intitled to the performance of your promise to permit me to leave this  innocent  house as one called  it but long have my ears been accustomed to such inversions of words as soon as the day breaks  Did my perdition depend upon it that you cannot Madam but upon terms And I hope you will not terrify meStill dreading the accursed knife  Nothing less than an attempt upon my honour shall make me desperateI have no view but to defend my honour With such a view only I entered into treaty with your infamous agent below The resolution you have seen I trust God will give me again upon the same occasion But for a  less  I wish not for it Only take notice women that I am no wife of  this man  Basely as he has used me I am not his wife He has no authority over me If he go away byandby and you act by his authority to detain me look to it  Then taking one of the lights she turned from us and away she went unmolested Not a soul was  able  to molest her  Mabell saw her tremblingly and in a hurry take the key of her chamberdoor out of her pocket and unlock it and as soon as she entered heard her double lock bar and bolt it  By her taking out her key when she came out of her chamber to us she no doubt suspected my design Which was to have carried her in my arms thither if she made such force necessary after I had intimidated her and to have been her companion for that night  She was to have had several bedchamberwomen to assist to undress her upon occasion But from the moment she entered the diningroom with so much intrepidity it was absolutely impossible to think of prosecuting my villainous designs against her  THIS This Belford was the hand I made of a  contrivance I expected so much from And now am I ten times worse off than before  Thou never sawest people in thy life look so like fools upon one another as the mother her partners and I did for a few minutes And at last the two devilish nymphs broke out into insulting ridicule upon me while the old wretch was concerned for her house the reputation of her house I cursed them all together and retiring to my chamber locked myself in  And now it is time to set out All I have gained detection disgrace fresh guilt by repeated perjuries and to be despised by her I  doat upon  and what is still worse to a proud heart by  myself  Success success in projects is every thing What an admirable fellow did I think myself till now Even for this scheme among the rest But how pitifully foolish does it appear to me now Scratch out erase never to be read every part of my preceding letters where I have boastingly mentioned itAnd never presume to railly me upon the cursed subject For I cannot bear it  But for the lady by my soul I love her I admire her more than everI  must  have her I  will  have her still  With  honour or  without  as I have often vowed My cursed fright at her accidental bloody nose so lately put her upon improving upon me thus Had she threatened ME I should soon have been mistress of  one  arm and  in both  But for so sincere a virtue to threaten  herself  and not offer to intimidate  any other  and with so much presence of mind as to distinguish in the very passionate intention the necessity of the act in def  nce of her  honour  and so  fairly  to disavow  lesser  occasions shewed such a deliberation such a choice such a principle and then keeping me so watchfull at a distance that I could not seize her hand so soon as she could have given the fatal blow how impossible  not to be subdued by so  true  and so  discreet  a magnanimity  But she is not  gone  shall not go I will press her with letters for the ThursdayShe shall yet be mine legally mine For as to cohabitation there is now no such thing to be thought of  The Captain shall give her away as proxy for her uncle My Lord will die My fortune will help my  will  and set me above everything and everybody  But here is the curseShe despises me Jack What man as I have heretofore said can bear to be despisedespecially by his wifeO Lord O Lord What a hand what a cursed hand have I made of this plotAnd here ends  The history of the Lady and the Penknife The devil take the penknifeIt goes against me to say God bless the Lady  Near    Sat Morn  LETTER LI  Mr  LOVELACE  To  Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE  Superscribed To Mrs  LOVELACE  M Hall  Sat Night June    My dearest Life  IF you do not impute to love and to terror raised by love the poor figure I made before you last night you will not do me justice I thought I would try to the very last moment if by complying with you in  everything  I could prevail upon you to promise to be mine on Thursday next since you refused me an earlier day Could I have been so happy you had not been hindered going to Hamstead or whereever else you pleased But when I could not prevail upon you to give me this assurance what room had I my demerit so great to suppose that your going thither wou  d not be to lose you for ever  I will own to you Madam that yesterday afternoon  I picked up the paper dropt by Dorcas who has confessed that she would have assisted you in getting away if she had had an opportunity so to do and undoubtedly dropped it by  accident  And could I have prevailed upon you as to the Thursday next I would have made no use of it secure as I should then have been in your word given to be mine But when I found you inflexible I was resolved to try if by resenting Dorcas's treachery I could not make  your  pardon of  me  the condition of  mine  to  her  And if not to make a handle of it to revoke my consent to your going away from Mrs Sinclair's since the consequence of that must have been so fatal to me  So far indeed was my proceeding  low  and  artful  And when I was challenged with it as such in so high and noble a manner I could not avoid taking shame to myself upon it  But you must permit me Madam to hope that you will not punish me too heavily for so poor a contrivance since no dishonour was meant you and since in the moment of its execution you had as great an instance of my incapacity to defend a wrong a low measure and at the same time of your power over me as mortal man could give In a word since you must have seen that I was absolutely under the controul both of Conscience and of Love  I will not offer to defend myself for  wishing you to remain where you are  till either you give me your word to meet me at the altar on Thursday or till I have the honour of attending you preparative to the solemnity which will make that day the happiest of my life  I am but too sensible that this kind of treatment may appear to you with the face of an arbitrary and illegal imposition But as the consequences not only to ourselves but to both our families may be fatal if you cannot be moved in my favour let me beseech you to forgive this act of compulsion on the score of the  necessity you your dear self have laid me under to be guilty of it and to permit the solemnity of next Thursday to include an act of oblivion of all past offences  The orders I have given to the people of the house are  That you shall be obeyed in every particular that is consistent with my expectations of finding you there on my return to town on Wednesday next That Mrs Sinclair and her nieces having incurred your just displeasure shall not without your orders come into your presence That neither shall Dorcas till she has fully cleared her conduct to your satisfaction be permitted to attend you But Mabell in her place of whom you seemed some time ago to express some liking Will I have left behind me to attend your commands If he be either negligent or impertinent  your  dismission shall be a dismission of him from my service for ever But as to letters which may be sent you or any which you may have to send I must humbly intreat that none such pass  from  or  to  you for the few days that I shall be absent  But I do assure you Madam that the seals of both sorts shall be sacred And the letters if such be sent shall be given into your own hands the moment the ceremony is performed or before if you require it  Mean time I will inquire and send you word how Miss Howe does and to what if I can be informed her long silence is owing  Dr Perkins I found here attending my Lord when I arrived with Dr S He acquaints me that your father mother uncles and the still  less  worthy persons of your family are well and intend to be all at your uncle Harlowe's next week I presume to keep his anniversary This can make no alteration but a happy one as to  persons  on Thursday because Mr Tomlinson assured me that if  anything fell out to hinder your uncle's coming up in person which however he did not then expect he would be satisfied if his friend the Captain were proxy for him I shall send a man and horse tomorrow to the Captain to be at greater certainty  I send this by a special messenger who will wait your pleasure Which I humbly hope will be signified in a line in relation to the impatientlywishedfor Thursday  My Lord tho' hardly sensible and unmindful of everything but of our felicity desires his most affectionate compliments to you He has in readiness to present you several valuables which he hopes will be acceptable whether he lives to see you adorn them or not  Lady Sarah and Lady Betty have also their tokens of respect ready to court your acceptance But may heaven incline you to give the opportunity of receiving their personal compliments and those of my cousins Montague before the next week be out  His Lordship is exceeding ill Dr S has no hopes of him The only consolation I can have for the death of a relation who loves me so well if he  do  die must arise from the additional power it will put into my hands of shewing how much I am  My dearest Life  Your everaffectionate and faithful  LOVELACE  LETTER LII  Mr  LOVELACE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Superscribed To Mrs  LOVELACE  M Hall  Sunday Night June    My dearest Love  I Cannot find words to express how much I am mortified at the return of my messenger without a line from you  Thursday is so near that I will send messenger after messenger every four hours till I have a favourable answer the one to meet the other till its eve arrives to know if I may venture to appear in your presence with the hope of having my wishes answered on that day  Your love Madam I neither expect nor ask for nor will till my future behaviour gives you cause to think I deserve it All I at present presume to wish is To have it in my power to do you all the justice I can now do you And to your generosity will I leave it to reward me as I shall merit with your affection  At present revolving my poor behaviour of Friday night before you I think I should sooner choose to go to my last audit unprepared for it as I am than to appear in your presence unless you give me some hope that I shall be received as your elected husband rather than however deserved as a detested criminal  Let me therefore propose an expedient in order to spare my own confusion and to spare you the necessity for that soulharrowing recrimination which I cannot stand and which must be disagreeable to yourself To name the church and I will have every thing in readiness so that our next interview will be in a manner at the very altar and then you will have the kind husband to forgive for the faults of the ingrateful lover If your resentment be still too high to write more let it only be in your own dear hand these words St Martin's church Thursdayor these St Giles's church Thursday nor will I insist upon any inscription or subscription or so much as the initials of your name This shall be all the favour I will expect till the dear hand self is given to mine in presence of that Being whom I invoke as a witness of the inviolable faith and honour of  Your adoring  LOVELACE  LETTER LIII  Mr  LOVELACE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Superscribed To Mrs  LOVELACE  M Hall  Monday June    ONCE more my dearest love do I conjure you to send me the four requested words There is no time to be lost And I would not have next Thursday go over without being intitled to call you mine for the world and that as well for your sake as my own Hitherto all that has passed is between you and me only but after Thursday if my wishes are unanswered the whole will be before the world  My Lord is extremely ill and endures not to have me out of his sight for one halfhour But this shall not weigh with me one iota if you be pleased to hold out the olivebranch to me in the four requested words  I have the following intelligence from Captain Tomlinson  All your family are at your uncle Harlowe's Your uncle finds he cannot go up and names Captain Tomlinson for his proxy He proposes to keep all your family with him till the Captain assures him that the ceremony is over  Already he has begun with hope of success to try to reconcile your mother to you  My Lord M but just now has told me how happy he should think himself to have an opportunity before he dies to salute you as his niece I have put him in hopes that he shall see you and have told him that I will go to town on Wednesday in order to prevail upon you to accompany me down on Thursday or Friday I have ordered a Set to be in readiness to carry me up and were not my Lord so very ill  my cousin Montague tells me she would offer  her  attendance on you If you please therefore we can set out for this place the moment the solemnity is performed  Do not dearest creature dissipate all these promising appearances and by refusing to save your own and your family's reputation in the eye of the world use yourself worse than the ingratefullest wretch on earth has used you For if we are married all the disgrace you imagine you have suffered while a single lady will be my own and only known to ourselves  Once more then consider well the situation we are both in and remember my dearest life that Thursday will be soon here and that you have no time to lose  In a letter sent by the messenger whom I dispatch with this I have desired that my friend Mr Belford who is your very great admirer and who knows all the secrets of my heart will wait upon you to know what I am to depend upon as to the chosen day  Surely my dear you never could at any time suffer half so much from cruel suspense as I do  If I have not an answer to this either from your own goodness or thro' Mr Belford's intercession it will be too late for me to set out And Captain Tomlinson will be disappointed who goes to town on purpose to attend your pleasure  One motive for the gentle restraint I have presumed to lay you under is to prevent the mischiefs that might ensue as probably to the  more  innocent as to the  less  were you to write to anybody while your passions were so much raised and inflamed against me Having apprised you of my direction on this head I wonder you should have endeavoured to send a letter to Miss Howe altho' in a cover directed  to that young lady's  The lady had made an attempt to send away a letter  servant as you must think it would be likely to fall into my hands  The just sense of what I have deserved the contents  should be  leaves me no room to doubt what they  are  Nevertheless I return it you inclosed with the seal as you will see unbroken  Relieve I beseech you dearest Madam by the four requested words or by Mr Belford the anxiety of  Your everaffectionate and obliged  LOVELACE  Remember there will not there  cannot  be time for further writing and for my comingup by Thursday  your uncle's birthday  LETTER LIV  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Monday June    THOU wilt see the situation I am in with Miss Harlowe by the inclosed copies of three letters to two of which I am too much scorned to have one word given me in answer and of the third now sent by the messenger who brings thee this I am afraid as little notice will be taken And if so her day of grace is absolutely over  One would imagine so long used to constraint too as she has been that she might have been satisfied with the triumph she had over us all on Friday night A triumph that to this hour has sunk my pride and my vanity so much that I almost hate the words  Plot Contrivance Scheme  and shall mistrust my self in future for every one that rises to my inventive head  But seest thou not that I am under a necessity to continue her at Sinclair's and to prohibit all her correspondences  Now Belford as I really in my present mood think of nothing less than marrying her if she let not Thursday slip I would have thee in pursuance of the intimation I have given her in my letter of this date to attend her and vow for me swear for me bind thy soul to her for my honour and use what arguments thy friendly heart can suggest in order to procure me an answer from her which as thou wilt see she may give in four words only And then I purpose to leave Lord M dangerously ill as he is and meet her at her appointed church in order to solemnize If she will sign but  Cl H  to  thy  writing the four words that shall do for I would not come up to be made a fool of in the face of all my family and friends  If she should let the day go offI shall be desperateI am intangled in my own devices and cannot bear that she should detect me  O that I had been honestWhat a devil are all my plots come to What do they end in but one grand plot upon myself and a title to eternal infamy and disgrace But depending on thy friendly offices I will say no more of thisLet her send me but one lineBut one lineNot treat me as  unworthy  of her notice yet be altogether in my powerI cannotI will not bear that  My Lord as I said is extremely ill The doctors give him over He gives himself over Those who would not have him die are afraid he will But as to myself I am doubtful For these long and violent struggles between the constitution and the disease tho' the latter has three physicians and an apothecary to help it forward and all three as to their prescriptions of different opinions too indicate a plaguy tough habit and favour more of recovery than death And the more so as he has no sharp or acute animal organs to whet out his bodily ones and to raise his fever above the symptomatic helpful one  Thou wilt see in the inclosed what pains I am at to dispatch messengers who are constantly on the road to meet each other and one of them to link in the chain with a fourth whose station is in London and five miles onward or till met But in truth I have some other matters for them to perform at the same time with my Lord's banker and his lawyer which will enable me if his Lordship is so good as to die this bout to be an overmatch for some of my other relations I don't mean Charlotte and Patty for they are noble girls but others who have been scratching and clawing underground like so many moles in my absence and whose workings I have discovered since I have been down by the little heaps of dirt they have thrown up  A speedy account of thy commission dear Jack The letter travels all night  LETTER LV  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  London  June    Tuesday  YOU must excuse me Lovelace from engaging in the office you would have me undertake till I can be better assured you really intend honourably at last by this muchinjured lady  I believe you know your friend Belford too well to think he would be easy with you or with any man alive who should seek to make him promise for him what he never intended to perform And let me tell thee that I have not much confidence in the honour of a man who by  imitation of hands  I will only call it has shewn so little regard to the honour of his own relations  Only that thou hast such jesuitical qualifyings or I should think thee at last touched with remorse and brought within view of being ashamed of thy cursed  inventions by the ill success of thy last Which I heartily congratulate thee upon  O the divine ladyBut I will not aggravate  Yet when thou writest that in thy  present mood  thou thinkest of marrying and yet canst so  easily  change thy  mood  When I know thy heart is against the stateThat the four words thou courtest from the lady are as much to thy purpose as if she wrote forty since it will shew she can forgive the highest injury that can be offered to woman And when I recollect how easily thou canst find excuses to postpone thou must be more explicit a good deal as to thy real intentions and future honour than thou art for I cannot trust to a temporary remorse which is brought on by disappointment too and not by principle and the like of which thou hast so often got over  If thou canst convince me time enough for the day that thou meanest to do honourably by her in  her own  sense of the word or if not time enough wilt fix some other day which thou oughtest to leave to her option and not bind her down for the Thursday and the rather as thy pretence for so doing is founded on an absolute fiction I will then most chearfully undertake thy cause by  person  if she will admit me to her presence if not by  pen  But in this case thou must allow me to be guarantee for thy faith And if so as much as I value thee and respect thy skill in all the qualifications of a gentleman thou may'st depend upon it that I will act up to the character of a guarantee with more honour than the princes of our day usually doto their shame be it spoken  Mean time let me tell thee that my heart bleeds for the wrongs this angelic lady has received And if thou dost  not  marry her if she will  have  thee and when married make her the best and tenderest of  husbands I would rather be a dog a monkey a bear a viper or a toad than thee  Command me with honour and thou shalt find none readier to oblige thee than  Thy sincere Friend  JOHN BELFORD  LETTER LVI  Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  M Hall  June    Tuesday Night near    YOURS reached me this moment by an extraordinary push in the messengers  What a man of honour thou of a sudden  And so in the imaginary shape of a guarantee thou threatenest me  Had I  not  been in earnest as to the lady I should not have offered to employ thee in the affair But let me tell thee that  hadst  thou undertaken the task and I had afterwards thought fit to change my mind I should have contented myself to tell thee that That  was  my mind when thou engagedst for me and to have given thee the reasons for the change and then left thee to thy own direction For never knew I what fear of man wasnor fear of woman neither till I became acquainted with Miss Clarissa Harlowe nay what is  most  surprising till I came to have her in my power  And so thou wilt not wait upon the charmer of my heart but upon terms and conditionsLet it alone and be curs'd I care not But so much credit did I give to the value thou expressedst for  her  that I thought the office would have been as acceptable to  thee  as serviceable to me for what was it but to endeavour to persuade her to consent to the reparation of her own honour For what have I done  but disgraced myself and been a thief to my own joys And if there be an union of hearts and an intention to solemnize what is there wanting but the foolish ceremonyAnd that I still offer But if she will keep back her hand if she will make me hold out mine in vainHow can I help it  I write her one more letter and if after she has received that she keep sullen silence she must thank herself for what is to follow  But after all my heart is wholly hers I love her beyond expression and cannot help it I hope therefore she will receive this last tender as I wish I hope she intends not like a true woman to plague and vex and teaze me now she has found her power If she will take me to mercy now these remorses are upon me tho' I scorn to condition with  thee  for my sincerity all her trials as I have heretofore declared shall be over and she shall be as happy as I can make her For ruminating upon all that has passed between us from the first hour of our acquaintance till the present I must pronounce That she is Virtue itself and once more I say has no equal  As to what you hint of leaving to her choice another day do you consider that it will be impossible that my contrivances and stratagems should be much longer concealedThis makes me press  that  day tho' so near and the more as I have made so much ado about her uncle's anniversary If she send me the  four words  I will spare no fatigue to be in time if not for the canonical hour at church for some other hour of the day in her own apartment or any other for money will do every thing And  that  I have never spared in this affair  To shew thee that I am not at enmity with thee I inclose the copies of two letters One to her It is the  fourth  and  must  be the  last  on the subject The other to Captain Tomlinson calculated as thou wilt see for him to shew her  And now Jack interfere in this case or not thou knowest the mind of  R LOVELACE  LETTER LVII  Mr  LOVELACE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Superscribed To Mrs  LOVELACE  M Hall  Wed Morn One o'Clock June    NOT one line my dearest life not one word in answer to three letters I have written The time is now so short that this  must  be the last letter that can reach you on this side of the important hour that might make us legally one  My friend Mr Belford is apprehensive that he cannot wait upon you in time by reason of some urgent affairs of his own  I the less regret the disappointment because I have procured a  more  acceptable person as I hope to attend you Captain Tomlinson I mean To whom I had applied for this purpose before I had Mr Belford's answer  I was the more solicitous to obtain this favour from him because of the office he is to take upon him as I humbly presume to hope tomorrow That office obliged him to be in town as this day And I acquainted him with my unhappy situation with you and desired that he would shew me on this occasion that I had as much of his favour and friendship as your uncle had since the whole treaty must be broken off if he could not prevail upon you in my behalf  He will dispatch the messenger directly whom I propose to meet in person at Slough either to proceed onward to London with a joyful heart or to return back to M Hall with a broken one  I ought not but cannot help it to anticipate the pleasure Mr Tomlinson proposes to himself in acquainting  you with the likelihood there is of your mother's seconding your uncle's views For it seems he has privately communicated to her his laudable intentions And  her  resolution depends as well as  his  upon what tomorrow will produce  Disappoint not then I beseech you for an hundred persons sakes as well as for mine  that  uncle and  that  mother whose displeasure I have heard you so often deplore  You may think it impossible for me to reach London by the canonical hour If it should the ceremony may be performed in your own apartment at any time in the day or at night So that Captain Tomlinson may have it to aver to your uncle that it was performed on his anniversary  Tell but the Captain that you  forbid me not  to attend you And that shall be sufficient for bringing  you on the wings of Love  Your evergrateful and affectionate  LOVELACE  LETTER LVIII  To Mr  PATRICK M'DONALD  at his Lodgings at Mr Brown's Perukemaker in St Martin'slane Westminster  M Hall  Wedn morning two o'clock June    Dear  M'DONALD  THE bearer of this has a letter to carry to the lady  Viz the preceding letter  I have been at the trouble of writing a copy of it which I inclose that you may not mistake your cue  You will judge of my reasons for antedating the inclosed sealed one  See the next letter  directed to you by the name of Tomlinson which you are to shew the lady as in confidence You will open it of course  I doubt not your dexterity and management dear M'Donald nor your zeal especially as the hope of cohabitation must now be given up Impossible to be carried is that scheme I might break her heart but not incline her will Am in earnest therefore to marry her if she let not the day slip  Improve upon the hint of her mother That must touch her But John Harlowe  remember  has  privately  engaged that Lady  Privately  I say else not to mention the reason for her uncle Harlowe's former expedient you know she might find means to get a letter away to the one or the other to know the truth or to Miss Howe to engage  her  to inquire into it And if she should the word  privately  will account for the uncle's and mother's denying it  However fail not as from me to charge our mother and her nymphs to redouble their vigilance both as to her person and letters All's upon a crisis now But she must not be treated ill neither  Thursday over I shall know what to resolve upon  If necessary you must assume authority The devil's in't if such a girl as this shall awe a man of your years and experience Fly out if she doubt your honour Spirits  naturally  soft may be beat out of their play and borne down tho' ever so much raised by higher anger All women are cowards at bottom Only violent when they  may  I have often stormed a girl out of her mistrusts and made her yield before she knew where she was to the point indignantly  mistrusted  and that to make up with me tho' I was the aggressor  If this matter succeed as I'd have it or if  not  and do not fail by your fault I will take you off of the necessity of pursuing your cursed Smuggling which otherwise may one day end fatally for you  We are none of us perfect M  c  Donald This sweet lady makes me serious sometimes in spite of my  heart But as private vices are less blameable than public and as I think  Smuggling  as it is called a National evil I have no doubt to pronounce you a much worse man than myself and as such shall take pleasure in reforming you  I send you inclosed ten guineas as a small earnest of further favours Hitherto you have been a very clever fellow  As to cloaths for Thursday Monmouthstreet will afford a ready supply Cloaths quite new would make your condition suspected But you may defer that care till you see if she can be prevailed upon Your ridingdress will do for the first visit Nor let your boots be over clean I have always told you the consequence of attending to the  minutiae  where art or  imposture  as the illmanner'd would call it is designedYour linen rumpled and soily when you wait upon her Easy terms these Just come to town Remember as formerly to loll to throw out your legs to stroke and grasp down your ruffles as if of significance enough to be careless What tho' the presence of a fine lady would require a different behaviour are you not of years to dispense with politeness You have no design upon her you know Are a father yourself of daughters as old as she Evermore is  parade  and  obsequiousness  suspectable It must shew either a foolish head or a knavish heart Make yourself of  consequence  therefore and you will be treated as a  man  of consequence I have often more than half ruined myself by my complaisance and being afraid of controul have brought controul upon myself  I think I have no more to say at present I intend to be at Slough or on the way to it as by mine to the lady Adieu honest M  c  Donald  R L  LETTER LIX  To Captain  ANTONY TOMLINSON  Inclosed in the preceding To be shewn to the Lady as in confidence  M Hall  Tuesday morn June    Dear Capt Tomlinson  AN unhappy misunderstanding having arisen between the dearest lady in the world and me the particulars of which she perhaps may give you but I will not because I might be thought partial to myself and the refusing to answer my most pressing and respectful letters I am at a most perplexing uncertainty whether she will meet us or not next Thursday to solemnize  My Lord is so extremely ill that if I thought she would not oblige me I would defer going up to town for two or three days He cares not to have me out of his sight Yet is impatient to salute my Beloved as his niece before he dies This I have promised to give him an opportunity to do intending if the dear creature will make me happy to set out with her for this place directly from church  With regret I speak it of the charmer of my soul but irreconcileableness is her familyfault The less excuseable indeed in  her  as she herself suffers by it in so high a degree from her own relations  Now Sir as you  intended  to be in town some time before Thursday if it be not too great an inconvenience to you I could be glad you would go up as soon as possible for my sake And this I the more boldly request as I presume that a man who has so many great affairs of his own in hand as you have would be glad to be at a certainty himself as to the day  You Sir can so pathetically and justly set before er the unhappy consequences that will follow if the  day be postponed as well with regard to her uncle's disappointment as to the part  you have assured me  her mother is willing to take in the wishedfor reconciliation that I have great hopes she will suffer herself to be prevailed upon And a man and horse shall be in waiting to take your dispatches and bring them to me  But if you cannot prevail in my favour you will be pleased to satisfy your friend Mr John Harlowe that it is not my fault that he is not obliged I am dear Sir  Your extremely obliged and faithful Servant  R LOVELACE  LETTER LX  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Wedn June    near    o'clock  Honoured Sir  I Received yours as your servant desired me to acquaint you  by ten this morning  Horse and man were in a foam  I instantly equipp'd myself as if come off from a journey and posted away to the lady intending to plead great affairs that I came not before in order to favour your  antedate  and likewise to be in a  hurry  to have a pretence to  hurry her Ladyship  and to take no denial for her giving a  satisfactory  return to your messenger But upon my entering Mrs Sinclair's house I found all in the greatest consternation  You must not Sir be surprised It is a trouble to me to be the relater of the bad news But so it is the lady is gone off She was missed but half an hour before I came  Her waitingmaid is run away or hitherto is not to be found So that they conclude it was by her connivance  They had sent before I came to my honoured masters Mr Belton Mr Mowbray and Mr Belford Mr Tourville is out of town  High words are passing between Madam Sinclair and Madam Horton and Madam Martin as also with Dorcas And your servant William threatens to hang or drown himself  They have sent to know if they can hear of Mabell the waitingmaid at her mother's who it seems lives in Chicklane WestSmithfield and to an uncle of her's also who keeps an alehouse at Cowcross hardby and with whom she lived last  Your messenger having just changed his horse is come back So I will not detain him longer than to add that I am with great concern for this misfortune and thanks for your seasonable favour and kind intentions towards me I am sure this was not my fault honoured Sir  Your most obliged humble Servant  PATRICK M  c  DONALD  LETTER LXI  Mr  MOWBRAY  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Dear Lovelace  Wednesday    o' clock  I Have plaguy news to acquaint thee with Miss Harlowe is gon offQuite gon by my soul I have not time for particulars your servant being going off But iff I had we are not yet come to the bottom of the matter The ladies here are all blubbering like devils accusing one another most confoundedly Whilst Belton and I damn them all together in thy name  If thou shouldst hear that thy fellow Will is taken dead out of some horsepond and Dorcas cutt down from her bed's teaster from dangling in her own garters be not surpriz'd Here's the devill to pay Nobody serene but Jack Belford who is taking  minutes of examminations accusations and confessions with the signifficant air of a Middlesex Justice and intends to write at large all particulars I suppose  I heartily condole with thee So does Belton But it may turn out for the best For she is gone away with thy marks I understand A foolish little devill Where will she mend herself For nobody will look upon her And they tell me that thou wouldst certainly have married her had she staidBut I know thee better  Dear Bobby adieu If thy uncle will die now to comfort thee for this Ioss what a  seasonable  exit would he make Let's have a letter from thee Pr'ythee do Thou canst write devillike to Belford who shews us nothing at all  Thine heartily  RD MOWBRAY  LETTER LXII  Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Thursday June    THOU hast heard from M  c  Donald and Mowbray the news Bad or good I know not which thou'lt deem it I only wish I could have given thee joy upon the same account before the unhappy lady was seduced from Hamstead For then of what an ingrateful villainy hadst thou been spared the perpetration which now thou hast to answer for  I came to town purely to serve thee with her expecting that thy next would satisfy me that I might endeavour it without dishonour And at first when I found her gone I half pitied thee for now wilt thou be inevitably blown up And in what an execrable light wilt thou appear to all the world Poor Lovelace Caught in thy own snares Thy punishment is but beginning  But to my narrative for I suppose thou expectest all particulars from me since Mowbray has informed thee that I have been collecting them  The noble exertion of spirit she had made on Friday night had it seems greatly disordered her insomuch that she was not visible till Saturday evening when Mabell saw her and she seemed to be very ill But on Sunday morning having dress'd herself as if designing to go to church she order'd Mabell to get her a coach to the door  The wench told her She was to obey her in every thing but the calling of a coach or chair  She sent for Will and gave him the same command  He pleaded his master's orders to the contrary and desired to be excused  Upon this down she went herself and would have gone out without observation But finding the streetdoor doublelock'd and the key not in the lock she stept into the streetparlour and would have thrown up the sash to call out to the people passing by as they doubted not But that since her last attempt of the same nature had been fasten'd down  Hereupon she resolutely stept into Mrs Sinclair's parlour in the backhouse where were the old devil and her two partners and demanded the key of the streetdoor or to have it opened for her  They were all surprised but desired to be excused pleading your orders  She asserted that you had no authority over her and never should have any That their present refusal was their own act and deed She saw the intent of their backhouse and the reason of putting her there She pleaded her condition and fortune and said They had no way to avoid utter ruin but by opening their doors to her or by murdering  her and burying her in their garden or cellar too deep for detection That already what had been done to her was punishable by death And bid them at their peril detain her  What a noble what a right spirit has this charming creature in cases that will justify an exertion of spirit  They answer'd That Mr Lovelace could prove his marriage and would indemnify them And they all would have vindicated their behaviour on Friday night and the reputation of their house But refusing to hear them on that topic she flung from them threatening  She then went up half a dozen stairs in her way to her own apartment But as if she had bethought herself down she stept again and proceeded towards the streetparlour saying as she passed by the infamous Dorcas I'll make myself protectors tho' the windows suffer But that wench of her own head on the lady's going out of that parlour to Mrs Sinclair's had lock'd the door and taken out the key So that finding herself disappointed she burst into tears and went menacing and sobbing up stairs again  She made no other attempt till the effectual one Your letters and messages they supposed coming so fast upon one another tho' she would not answer one of them gave  her  some amusement and an assurance to  them  that she would at last forgive you and that then all would end as you wish'd  The women in pursuance of your orders offer'd not to obtrude themselves upon her and Dorcas also kept out of her sight all the rest of Sunday also on Monday and Tuesday But by the lady's condescension even to familiarity to Mabell they imagined that she must be working in her mind all that time to get away They therefore redoubled their cautions to the wench Who told  them so faithfully all that passed between her lady and her that they had no doubt of her fidelity to her wicked trust  'Tis probable she might have been contriving something all this time but saw no room for perfecting any scheme The contrivance by which she effected her escape seems to me not to have been fallen upon till the very day since it depended partly upon the  weather  as it proved But it is evident she hoped something from Mabell's simplicity or gratitude or compassion by cultivating all the time her civility to her  Polly waited on her early on Wednesday morning and met with a better reception than she had  reason  to expect She complained however with warmth of her confinement Polly said There would be an happy end to it if it  were  a confinement next day she presumed She absolutely declared to the contrary in the way Polly meant it and said That Mr Lovelace on his  return    Which look'd as if she intended to wait for it  should have reason to repent the orders he had given as  they all should  their observance of them Let him send twenty letters she would not answer one be the consequence what it would nor give him hope of the least favour while she was in that house She had given Mrs Sinclair and themselves fair warning she said No orders of another ought to make them detain a free person But having made an open attempt to  go  and been detained by them she was the calmer she told Polly Let  them  look to the consequence  But yet she spoke this with temper and Polly gave it as her opinion with apprehension for their own safety that having so good a handle to punish them all she would not go away if she might And what inferred Polly is the indemnity of a man who has committed the vilest of rapes on a  person of condition and must himself if prosecuted for it either fly or be hang'd  Sinclair so I will still call her upon this representation of Polly foresaw she said  the ruin of her poor house  in the issue of this  strange  business as she call'd it and Sally and Dorcas bore their parts in the apprehension And this put them upon thinking it adviseable for the future that the streetdoor should generally in the daytime be only left upon a boltlatch as they call'd it which anybody might open on the inside and that the key should be kept in the door that their numerous  comers  and  goers  as they called their guests should be able to give evidence that she might have gone out if she would Not forgetting however to renew their orders to Will to Dorcas to Mabell and the rest to redouble their vigilance on this occasion to prevent her escape None of them doubting at the same time that her love of a man so considerable in  their  eyes and the prospect of what was to happen as she had reason to believe on Thursday her uncle's birthday would tho' perhaps not till the last hour for her  pridesake  was their word engage her to change her temper  They believe that she discover'd the key to be left in the door for she was down more than once to walk in the little garden and seemed to cast her eye each time to the streetdoor  About eight yesterday morning an hour after Polly had left her she told Mabell She was sure she should not live long and having a good many suits of apparel which after her death would be of no use to anybody she valued she would give her a brown lustring gown which with some alterations to make it more suitable to her degree would a great while serve her for a Sunday wear for that she Mabell was the only person in that  house of whom she could think without terror or antipathy  Mabell expressing her gratitude upon the occasion the lady said She had nothing to employ herself about and if she could get a workwoman directly she would look over her things then and give her what she intended for her  Her mistress's mantuamaker the maid replied lived but a little way off and she doubted not that she could procure  her  or one of her journeywomen to alter the gown out of hand  I will give you also said she a quilted coat which will require but little alteration if any for you are much about my stature But the gown I will give directions about because the sleeves and the robings and facings must be alter'd for your wear being I believe above your station And try said she if you can get the workwoman and we'll advise about it If she cannot come now let her come in the afternoon but I had rather now because it will amuse me to give you a lift  Then stepping to the window It rains said she and so it had done all the morning Slip on the hood and short cloak I have seen you wear and come to me when you are ready to go out because you shall bring me in something that I want  Mabell equipp'd herself accordingly and received her commands to buy her some trifles and then left her but in her way out stept into the back parlour where Dorcas was with Mrs Sinclair telling her where she was going and on what account bidding Dorcas look out till she came back So faithful was the wench to the trust reposed in her and so little had the lady's generosity wrought upon her  Mrs Sinclair commended her Dorcas envied her and took her cue And Mabell soon returned with the mantuamaker's journeywoman She was  resolved she said she would not come without her and then Dorcas went off guard  The lady look'd out the gown and petticoat and before the workwoman caused Mabell to try it on and that it might sit the better made the willing wench pull off her upper petticoat and put on that she gave her Then she bid them go into Mr Lovelace's apartment and contrive about it before the pierglass there and stay till she came to them to give them her opinion  Mabell would have taken her own cloaths and hood and short cloak with her But her lady said No matter you may put them on again here when we have consider'd about the alterations There's no occasion to litter the other room  They went and instantly as it is supposed she slipt on Mabell's gown and petticoat over her own which was white damask and put on the wench's hood short cloak and ordinary apron and down she went  Hearing somebody tripping along the passage both Will and Dorcas whipt to the innerhall door and saw her but taking her for Mabell Are you going far Mabell cried Will  Without turning her face or answering she held out her hand pointing to the stairs which they construed as a caution for them to look out in her absence and supposing she would not be long gone as she had not formally repeated her caution to them up went Will tarrying at the stairshead in expectation of the supposed Mabell's return  Mabell and the workwoman waited a good while amusing themselves not disagreeably the one with contriving in the way of her business the other delighting herself with her fine gown and coat But at last wondering the lady did not come in to them Mabell tiptoed it to her door and tapping and not being answer'd stept into the chamber  Will at that instant from his station at the stairshead seeing Mabell in her  lady  's cloaths for he had been told of the present Gifts to servants fly from servant to servant in a minute was very much surprised having as he thought just seen her go out in  her own  and stepping up met her at the door How the devil can this be said he Just now you went out in your own dress How came you here in This And how could you pass me unseen But nevertheless kissing her said He would now brag he had kissed his lady or one in her cloaths  I am glad Mr William cried Mabell to see you here so diligently But know you where my lady is  In my master's apartment i'n't she interrogated Will Was she not talking with you this moment  No that's Mrs Dolins's journeywoman  They both stood aghast as they said Will again recollecting he had seen Mabell as he thought go out in her own cloaths And while they were debating and wondering up comes Dorcas with your fourth letter just then brought for her lady and seeing Mabell dress'd out whom she had likewise beheld a little before as she supposed in her common cloaths she joined in the wonder till Mabell reentering the lady's apartment missed her own cloaths and then suspecting what had happen'd and letting the others into the ground of her suspicion they all agreed that she had certainly escaped And then followed such an uproar of mutual accusation and  You should have done this  and  You should have done that  as alarmed the whole house every apartment in both houses giving up its devil to the number of fourteen or fifteen including the mother and her partners  Will told them  his  story and then ran out as  on the like occasion formerly to make inquiry whether the lady was seen by any of the coachmen chairmen or porters plying in that neighbourhood While Dorcas cleared herself immediately and that at the poor Mabell's expence who made a figure as guilty as aukward having on the suspected price of her treachery which Dorcas out of envy was ready to tear from her back  Hereupon all the pack open'd at the poor wench while the mother foaming at the mouth bellow'd out her orders for seising the suspected offender who could neither be heard in her own defence nor  had  she been heard would have been believed  That such a perfidious wretch should ever disgrace  her  house was the mother's cry  Good  people  might  be corrupted but it was a fine thing if such a house as  hers  could not be faithfully served by cursed creatures who hired themselves upon  character  and had no pretence to  principle  Damn her the wretch proceededShe had no patience with her Call the cook and call the scullion  They were at hand  See that guilty  pyeball  devil was her word her lady's gown upon her backBut I'll punish her for a warning to all betrayers of their trust Put on the great gridiron this moment an oath or a curse at every word Make up a roaring fireThe cleaver bring me this instantI'll cut her into quarters with my own hands and carbonade and broil the traitress for a feast to all the dogs and cats in the neighbourhood and eat the first slice of the toad myself without salt or pepper  The poor Mabell frighten'd out of her wits expected every moment to be torn in pieces having half a score openclaw'd paws upon her all at once She promised to confess all But that All when she had obtained a hearing was nothing for  nothing  had she to confess  Sally hereupon with a  curse of mercy  ordered her to retire undertaking that she and Polly would examine her themselves that they might be able to write all particulars to  his Honour  and then if she could not clear herself or if guilty give some account of the lady who had been so  wicked  as to give them all this trouble so as they might get her again then the cleaver and gridiron might go to work with all their hearts  The wench glad of this reprieve went up stairs and while Sally was laying out the law and prating away in her usual dictatorial manner whipt on another gown and sliding down stairs escaped to her relations And this flight which was certainly more owing to  terror  than  guilt  was in the true Old Bailey construction made a confirmation of the latter  These are the particulars of Miss Harlowe's flight Thou'lt hardly think me too minuteHow I long to triumph over thy impatience and fury on the occasion  Let me beseech thee my dear Lovelace in thy next letter to rave most gloriouslyI shall be grievously disappointed if thou dost not  Where Lovelace can the poor lady be gone And who can describe the distress she must be in  By your former letters it may be supposed that she can have very little money Nor by the suddenness of her flight more cloaths than those she has on And thou knowest who once said  Vol  iv  p      Her Parents will not receive her Her Uncles will not entertain her Her Norton is in their direction and cannot Miss Howe dare not She has not one friend or intimate in town intirely a stranger to it  And let me add has been despoiled of her honour by the man for whom she made all these  sacrifices and who stood bound to her by a thousand oaths and vows to be her husband her protector and friend  How strong must be her resentment of the barbarous treatment she has received How worthy of herself that it has made her  hate  the man she once  loved  And rather than marry him choose to expose her disgrace to the whole world to forego the reconciliation with her friends which her heart was so set upon and to hazard a thousand evils to which her youth and her sex may too probably expose an indigent and friendless beauty  Rememberest thou not that home push upon thee in one of the papers written in her delirium of which however it favours not  I will assure thee that I have very often since most seriously reflected upon it And as thy intended second outrage convinces me that it made no impression upon thee then and perhaps thou hast never thought of it since I will transcribe the sentence  If as Religion teaches us God will judge us in a great measure by our benevolent or evil actions to one anotherO wretch bethink thee in time bethink thee how great must be thy condemnation  See p of this Volume    And is this amiable doctrine the Sum of Religion Upon my faith I believe it is For to indulge a serious thought since we are not atheists except in  practice  Does God the BEING of beings want any thing of us for HIMSELF And does he not injoin us works of mercy to one another as the means to obtain  His  mercy A sublime principle and worthy of the SUPREME SUPERINTENDENT and FATHER of all thingsBut if we  are  to be judged by this noble principle what  indeed  must be  thy  condemnation on the score of this lady only And what  mine  and what all our  confraternity  's on the score  of other women tho' we are none of us half so bad as thou art as well for want of inclination I hope as of opportunity  I must add that as well for thy  own  sake as for the  lady  's I wish ye were yet to be married to each other It is the only medium that can be hit upon to salve the honour of both All that's past may yet be concealed from the world and from her relations and thou mayst make amends for all her sufferings if thou resolvest to be a tender and kind husband to her  And if this really be thy intention I will accept with pleasure of a commission from thee that shall tend to promote so good an end whenever she can be found that is to say if she will admit to her presence a man who professes friendship to thee Nor can I give a greater demonstration that I am  Thy sincere Friend  J BELFORD  PS  Mabell's cloaths were thrown into the passage this morning Nobody
