 THE COUNT OF NARBONNE A TRAGEDY  Price  s    d    Lately published By the same Author  BRAGANZA a Tragedy  The LAW OF LOMBARDY a Tragedy  THE COUNT OF NARBONNE A TRAGEDY  As it is acted at the THEATRE ROYAL In COVENT GARDEN  By ROBERT JEPHSON  Esq  LONDON Printed for T CADELL in the Strand MDCCLXXXI  TO THE HONOURABLE HORACE WALPOLE THIS TRAGEDY IS INSCRIBED WITH THE GREATEST RESPECT AND GRATITUDE BY HIS MOST OBLIGED AND VERY OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANT  ROBERT JEPHSON  Dublin Castle  Nov  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr WROUGHTON  OF all who strive to please the publick car  Most bold is he who dares attempt it here  Where four tribunals a tremendous show  Plain folk above and finer folk below  All sit to try an anxious Author's cause  Each by its own and all by different laws  This beauteous circle friends to polish'd verse  Admires soft sentiments in language terse  While the stern Pit all ornament disdains  And loves deep pathos and sublimer strains  The middle order free from critick pride  Take genuine nature for their faithful guide  At ears and eyes they drink the full delight  And judge but as they feel of wrong and right  While those above them honest souls delight in  Processions bustle trumpets drums and fighting  Hard as it is we think our Play tonight  Has something fit for every appetite  For tender souls are tender griefs prepar'd  To the Boxes  And scenes of direr woe for breasts more hard  To the Pit  By interesting your passions we must try  To the Middle Gallery  To bribe the heart while we defraud the eye  And though no trumpets sound nor drums will rattle  You friends shall  hear  of a most desperate battle  To the Upper Gallery  Thus provident for all we trust you'll own  Our poet's zeal may for some faults atone  In this at least he hopes you'll all agree  To shield him from the critick's treachery  Who with sly rules upon your judgement stealing  Would set your pride against your honest feeling  Would shame the generous drops that swell your eyes  And teach you your own virtues to despise  Permit me ere I go one short relation  And just three words by way of application  A homespun country 'squire who took his stand  To see a dex'trous juggler's sleight of hand  Was thus accosted by an envious wight  Who sought to hurt the artist from pure spight  "Sir for these tricks I'll presently expose them  "There's nothing in't I'll show you how he does "them"  How think you the proposal was receiv'd  "No says the 'squire I pay to be deceiv'd"  Thus Criticks when poor Authors they condemn  Mean nothing kind to you but spleen to them  Then still mistrust whate'er he may profess  The friend who strives to make your pleasure less  Persons Represented  Raymond  Count of  Narbonne  Mr WROUGHTON  Austin  a Priest  Mr HENDERSON  Theodore  a Peasant  Mr LEWIS  Fabian  an old Servant of the  Count  Mr THOMPSON  Hortensia  Countess of  Narbonne  Miss YOUNGE  Adelaide  Daughter of the  Count  and  Countess  Miss SATCHELL

Hall  Count  as he enters speaking to an Officer  Fabian  following  COUNT  NOT to be found is this your faithful service  How could she pass unseen By hell 'tis false  Thou hast betray'd me  OFFICER  Noble sir my duty  COUNT  Your fraud your negligenceaway reply not  Find her within this hour else by my life  The gates of Narbonne shall be clos'd against thee  make the world thy country  Exit  Officer  Fabian stay  Misfortunes fall so thick upon my head  They will not give me time to think to breathe  FABIAN  Heaven knows I wish your peace but am to learn  What grief more fresh than my young lord's decease  A sorrow but of three days pass'd can move you  COUNT  O bitter memory gone gone for ever  The pillar of my house my only son  FABIAN  'Twas terrible indeed  COUNT  Ay was it not  And then the manner of it think on that  Disease that robb'd me of two infant sons  Approaching slow bade me prepare to lose them  I saw my lilies drooping and accustom'd  To see them dying bore to see them dead  But O my EdmundThou remember'st Fabian  How blithe he went to seek the forest's sport  FABIAN  Would I could not remember  COUNT  That curs'd Barb  My fatal gift that dash'd him down the cliff  Seem'd proud or his gay burdenBreathless mangled  They bore him back to me Fond man I hoped  This day his happy match with Isabel  Had made our line perpetual and this day  The unfruitful grave receives him Yes 'tis fate  That dreadful denunciation 'gainst my house  No prudence can avert nor prayers can soften  FABIAN  Think not on that some visionary's dream  What house what family could e'er know peace  If each enthusiast's ravings were believ'd  And frenzy deem'd an insight of the future  But may I dare to ask is it of moment  To stir your anger thus that Isabel  Has left the castle  COUNT  Of the deepest moment  My best hope hangs on her some future time  I may instruct thee whyThese cares unhinge me  Just now a herald from her angry father  Left me this dire electionto resign  My titles and this ample signory  Worthy a monarch's envy or to meet him  And try my right by arms But pr'ythee tell  Nor let a fear to wound thy master's pride  Restrain thy licens'd speech hast thou e'er heard  My father Raymondcast not down thine eye  By any indirect or bloody means  Procur'd that instrument Alphonso's will  That made him heir to Narbonne  FABIAN  My best lord  At all times would I fain withhold from you  Intelligence unwelcome but most now  At seasons such as this a friendly tongue  Should utter words like balm but what you ask  COUNT  I ask to be inform'd of Hast thou known me  From childhood up to man and canst thou fear  I am so weak of soul like a thin reed  To bend and stagger at each puny blast  No when the tempest rages round my head  I give my branches wider to the air  And strike my root more deeplyTo thy tale  Away with palliatives and compliment  Speak plainly  FABIAN  Plainly then my lord I have heard  What for the little breath I have to draw  I would not to the black extent of rumour  Give credit toBut you command me speak  COUNT  Thy pauses torture meCan I hear worse  Than this black scroll contains this challenge here  From Isabella's father haughty Godfrey  In broad and unambiguous words he tells me  My father was a murderer and forg'd  Alphonso's testament  FABIAN  From Palestine  That tale crept hither where foul slander says  The good Alphonso not as we believe  Died of a fever but a venom'd draught  Your father his companion of the cross  Did with his own hand mingle his hand too  Assisted by some cunning practisers  Model'd that deed which barring Godfrey's right  And other claims from kindred nam'd Count Raymond  Lord of these fair possessions  COUNT  Ha I have it  'Tis Godfrey's calumny he has coin'd this lie  And his late visit to the holy land  No doubt has furnish'd likelihood of proof  To give his fiction colour  FABIAN  Sure 'tis so  COUNT  He too has forg'd this idle prophecy  To shake me with false terrors this prediction  Which but to think of used to freeze my veins  "That no descendant from my father's loins  "Should live to see a grandson nor heaven's wrath  "Cease to afflict us till Alphonso's heir  "Succeeded to his just inheritance"  Hence Superstition mines my tottering state  Loosens my vassals' faith and turns their tears  Which else would fall for my calamities  To gloomy pause and gaping reverence  While all my woes to their perverted sense  Seem but the marvellous accomplishment  Of revelation out of nature's course  FABIAN  Reason must so interpret Good my lord  What answer was return'd to Godfrey's challenge  COUNT  Defiance  FABIAN  Heaven defend you  COUNT  Heaven defend me  I hope it will and this right arm to boot  But hark I hear a noisePerhaps my people  Have found the fugitiveHaste bid them enter  Exit  Fabian  SCENE II  COUNT  alone  She eyed me with abhorrence at the sound  Of love of marriage sled indignant from me  Yet I must win her should she meet my wish  Godfrey would prop the right he strives to shake  Securing thus to his fair daughter's issue  All that now hangs on the sword's doubtful point  Her beauty too each soft attractive grace  I saw with jealous pleasure even when destin'd  To my son's arms His death removes one bar  And fortune to my double aim conspiring  I'll silence saucy conscience  SCENE III  To the  Count Fabian Officer  and Attendants bringing in a young Peasant  Now what tidings  Where is the lady  OFFICER  We have search'd in vain  The castle round left not an aile or vault  Unvisited  COUNT  Damnation  OFFICER  Near the cloister  From whence by the flat door's descent a passage  Beneath the ground leads onward to the convent  We heard the echo of a falling weight  And sought it by the sound  COUNT  Well and what then  OFFICER  The unsettled dust left us no room to doubt  The door had just been rais'd  COUNT  She has escap'd  And by confed'racy to force that bar  Without more aid had baffled twice her strength  Go on  OFFICER  We enter'd with resistance bold  This peasant push'd us backward from the spot  My arm was rais'd to smite him but respect  For something in his aspect check'd the blow  He chiding parlying by turns gave time  For whosoever had descended there  The lady doubtless to elude our search  The rest himself will tell  COUNT  To the Peasant  Ha what art thou  PEASANT  It seems thy prisoner disengage me first  From their rude gripe and I may tell thee more  COUNT  Unhand him I should know thee I have seen  Features like thine Answer me wert thou found  As these men say  PEASANT  I was  COUNT  And what thy purpose  PEASANT  Chance brought me there  COUNT  And did chance lead thee too  To aid a fugitive  PEASANT  They saw not that  COUNT  They saw it not How could her delicate hands  Weak soft and yielding to the gentlest touch  Sustain that pond'rous mass No those tough arms  Thy force assisted else thou young dissembler  PEASANT  She had been seiz'd and by compulsion brought  Where I stand now  COUNT  Thou dost avow it then  Boast it even to my face audacious stripling  Such insolence and these coarse rustick weeds  Are contradictions Answer me who art thou  PEASANT  Less than I should be more than what I seem  COUNT  Hence with this saucy ambiguity  What is thy name thy country That mean habit  Which should teach humbleness speaks thy condition  PEASANT  My name is Theodore my country France  My habit little suited to my mind  Less to my birth yet sit for my condition  COUNT  O thou art then some young adventurer  Some roving knight a hero in disguise  Who scorning forms of vulgar ceremony  No leave obtain'd waiting no invitation  Enters our castles wanders o'er our halls  To succour dames distress'd or pilfer gold  Where are your train your pages and your squires  Perhaps but poorly lodg'd I am to blame  But must excuse my scanted courtesy  By ignorance of your high character  PEASANT  There is a source of reverence for thee here  Forbids me though provok'd retort thy taunts  COUNT  If I endure this more I shall grow vile  Even to my hinds  PEASANT  Hold let me stop thy wrath  I see thy quivering lip thy firy eye  Forerun a storm of passion To prevent thee  From terms too harsh perhaps for thee to offer  Or me to hear poor as I seem with honour  I will cut short thy interrogatories  And on this theme give thee the full extent  Of all I know or thou canst wish to learn  COUNT  Do it  PEASANT  Without a view to thwart thy purpose  Be what it might was I within thy walls  In a dim passage of the castleailes  Musing alone I heard a hasty tread  And breath drawn short like one in fear of peril  A lady enter'd fair she seem'd and young  Guiding her timorous footsteps by a lamp  "The lord the tyrant of this place she cried  "For a detested purpose follows me  "Aid me▪ good youth" then pointing to the ground  "That door she added leads to sanctuary"  I seiz'd an iron hold and while I tugg'd  To heave the unwilling weight I learn'd her title  COUNT  The lady Isabel  PEASANT  The same A gleam  Shot from their torches who pursued her track  Prevented more she hasten'd to the cave  And vanish'd from my sight  COUNT  And did no awe  No fear of him she call'd this castle's lord  Its tyrant chill thee  PEASANT  Awe nor fear I know not  And trust shall never for I know not guilt  COUNT  Then thou it seems art master here not I  Thou canst control my projects blast my schemes  And turn to empty air my power in Narbonne  Nay should my daughter choose to fly my castle  Against my bidding guards and bolts were vain  This frizeclad champion gallant Theodore  Would lend his ready arm and mock my caution  PEASANT  Thy daughter O I were indeed too bless'd  Could I but live to render her a service  COUNT  My daughter would I hope disdain thy service  PEASANT  Wherefore am I to blame What I have done  Were it to do again again I'd do it  And may this arm drop palsied by my side  When its cold sinews shrink to aid affliction  COUNT  Indeed  PEASANT  Indeed Frown on Ask thy own heart  Did innocence and beauty bend before thee  Hunted and trembling would'st thou tamely pause  Scanning pale counsel from deliberate fear  And weigh each possibility of danger  No the instinctive nobleness of blood  Would start beyond the reach of such cold scruples  And instant gratify its generous ardour  COUNT  Aside  I must know more of this His phrase his look  His steady confidence raise something here  Bids me beware of himI have no time  To bandy idle words with slaves like thee  I doubt not thy intent was mischievous  Booty perhaps or blood Till more enquiry  Clear or condemn him hold him in your guard  Give none admittanceTake him from my sight  PEASANT  Secure in her integrity my soul  Casts back thy mean suspicions and forgives thee  Theodore  is led out  SCENE IV  Count Fabian  COUNT  Away with himWhat means this heaviness  My heart that like a welltrimm'd gallant bark  Was wont to mount the waves and dash them off  In ineffectual foam now seems to crack  And let in each assailing tide to sink me  I must not yield to this dull lethargy  Good Fabian hie thee to Saint Nicholas'  Bid holy Austin straight repair to me  Exit  Fabian  SCENE V  Count  alone  His sanctity and reverend character  His pious eloquence made engines for me  Might save a world of anguish to my soul  And smooth my unwelcome purpose to Hortensia  But how prevail with himAmbitionNo  The world is dead in him and gold is trash  To one who neither needs nor values it  Interest and Love shall wear the guise of conscience  I must pretend nice scruples which I feel not  And make him mediate for me with the Church  Yet he reveres the Countess and I fear  Will spy more sin in doubts that wound her quiet  Than in my stifling them But see she comes  With downcast eye and sad dejected mien  I will not yet disclose it  SCENE VI  To him the  Countess  Where's my child  My all of comfort now my Adelaide  COUNTESS  Dear as she is I would not have her all  For I should then be nothing Time has been  When after three long days of absence from you  You would have question'd me a thousand times  And bid me tell each trifle of myself  Then satisfied at last that all were well  At last unwilling turn to meaner cares  COUNT  This is the nature still of womankind  If fondness be their mood we must cast off  All gravecomplexion'd thought and turn our souls  Quite from their tenour to wild levity  Vary with all their humours take their hues  As unsubstantial Iris from the sun  Our bosoms are their passive instruments  Vibrate their strain or all our notes are discord  COUNTESS  O why this new unkindness From thy lips  Never till now fell such ungentle words  Nor ever less was I prepar'd to meet them  COUNT  Never till now was I so urg'd beset  Hemm'd round with perils  COUNTESS  Ay but not by me  COUNT  By thee and all the world But yesterday  With uncontrolable and absolute sway  I rul'd this province was the unquestion'd lord  Of this strong castle and its wide domains  Stretch'd beyond sight around me and but now  The axe perhaps is sharp'ning may hew down  My perish'd trunk and give the soil I sprung from  To cherish my proud kinsman Godfrey's roots  COUNTESS  Heaven guard thy life His dreadful summons reach'd me  This urg'd me hither On my knees I beg  And I have mighty reasons for my prayer  O do not meet him on this argument  By gentler means strive to divert his claim  Fly this detested place this house of horrour  And leave its gloomy grandeur to your kinsman  COUNT  Rise fearful woman What renounce my birthright  Go forth like a poor friendless banish'd man  To gnaw my heart in cold obscurity  Thou weak adviser Should I take thy counsel  Thy tongue would first upbraid thy spirit scorn me  COUNTESS  No on my soulIs Narbonne all the world  My country is where thou art place is little  The sun will shine the earth produce its fruits  Chearful and plenteously where'er we wander  In humbler walks bless'd with my child and thee  I'd think it Eden in some lonely vale  Nor heave one sigh for these proud battlements  COUNT  Such flowery softness suits not matron lips  But thou hast mighty reasons for thy prayer  They should be mighty reasons to persuade  Their rightful lord to leave his large possessions  A soldier challeng'd to decline the combat  COUNTESS  And are not prodigies then mighty reasons  The owl mistakes his season in broad day  Screaming his hideous omens spectres glide  Gibbering and pointing as we pass along  While the deep earth's unorganized caves  Send forth wild sounds and clamours terrible  These towers shake round us though the untroubled air  Stagnates to lethargyour children perish  And new disasters blacken every hour  Blood shed unrighteously blood unappeas'd  Though we are guiltless cries I fear for vengeance  COUNT  Blood shed unrighteously have I shed blood  No nature's common frailties set aside  I'll meet my audit boldly  COUNTESS  Mighty Lord  O not on us with justice too severe  Visit the sin not ours  COUNT  What can this mean  Something thou would'st reveal that's terrible  COUNTESS  Too long alas it has weigh'd upon my heart  A thousand times I have thought to tell thee all  But my tongue falter'd and refus'd to wound thee  COUNT  Distract me not but speak  COUNTESS  I must Your father  Was wise brave politick but mad ambition  Heaven pardon him it prompts to desperate deeds  COUNT  I scarce can breathe Pr'ythee be quick and ease me  COUNTESS  Your absence on the Italian embassy  Left him you know alone to my fond care  Long had some hidden grief like a slow fire  Wasted his vitalson the bed of death  One object seem'd to harrow up his soul  The picture of Alphonso in the chamber  On that his eye was setMethinks I see him  His ashy hue his grizzled bristling hair  His palms spread wide For ever would he cry  "That aweful form how terrible he frowns  "See how he bares his livid leprous breast  "And points the deadly chalice"  COUNT  Ha even so  COUNTESS  Sometimes he'd seize my hands and grasp them close  And strain them to his hollow burning eyes  Then falter out "I am I am a villain  "Mild angel pray for me stir not my child  "It comes again oh do not leave my side"  At last quite spent with mortal agonies  His soul went forth and heaven have mercy on him  COUNT  Enough Thy tale has almost iced my blood  Let me not think Hortensia on thy duty  Suffer no breath like this to pass thy lips  I will not taint my noble father's honour  By vile suspicions suck'd from nature's dregs  And the loose ravings of distemper'd fancy  COUNTESS  Yet O decline this challenge  COUNT  That hereafter  Mean time prepare my daughter to receive  A husband of my choice Should Godfrey come  Strife might be so prevented bid her try  Her beauty's power Stand thou but neuter Fate  Courage and art shall arm me from mankind  Exeunt  End of the First Act  ACT II  SCENE I  A Chamber  Fabian Jaqueline  FABIAN  NO no it cannot be My lord's commands  Were absolute that none should visit him  JAQUELINE  What need he know it  FABIAN  But perchance he should  The study of my life has been his pleasure  Nor will I risk his favour to indulge  Such unavailing curiosity  JAQUELINE  Call it not so I have kind counsel for him  Which if he follow it may serve to speed  The hour of his deliverance and appease  The unjustlyanger'd Count  FABIAN  Pray be content  I dare not do it Have this castle's walls  Hous'd thee nine years and art thou yet to learn  The temper of the Count Serv'd and obey'd  There lives not one more gracious liberal  Offend him and his rage is terrible  I'd rather play with serpents But fair Jaqueline  Setting aside the comeliness and grace  Of this young rustick which I own are rare  And baits to catch all women pr'ythee tell  Why are you thus solicitous to see him  JAQUELINE  In me 'twere base to be indifferent  He was my life's preserver nay preserv'd  A life more precious yes my dear young mistress  But for his aid the eternal sleep of death  Had closed the sweetest eyes that ever beam'd  Aloof and frighted stood her coward train  And saw a furious band of desperate slaves  Inur'd to blood and rapine bear her off  FABIAN  What when the gang of outlaw'd Thiery  Rush'd on her chariot near the wood of Zart  Was he the unknown youth who succour'd her  All good betide him for it  JAQUELINE  Yes 'twas he  From one tame wretch he snatch'd a halfdrawn sword  And dealt swift vengeance on the ruffian crew  Two at his seet stretch'd dead the rest amaz'd  Fled muttering curses while he bore her back  Unhurt but by her fears  FABIAN  He should be worship'd  Have statues rais'd to him for by my life  I think there does not breathe another like her  It makes me young to see her lovely eyes  Such charity such sweet benevolence  So fair and yet so humble prais'd for ever  Nay wonder'd at for nature's rarest gifts  Yet lowlier than the lowest  JAQUELINE  Is it strange  Fair Adelaide and I thus bound to him  Are anxious for his safety What offence  And sure 'twas unintended could provoke  The rigorous Count thus to imprison him  FABIAN  My Lord was ever proud and cholerick  The youth perhaps unused to menaces  Brook'd them but ill and darted frown for frown  This stirr'd the Count to fury But fear nothing  All will be well I'll wait the meetest season  And be his advocate  JAQUELINE  Mean time repair to him  Bid him be patient let him want no comfort  Kind care can minister My lady comes  May I assure her of your favour to him  FABIAN  Assure her that the man who sav'd her life  Is dear to Fabian as his vital blood  Exit  SCENE II  To  Jaqueline Adelaide  ADELAIDE  I sent thee to his prison Quickly tell me  What says he does he know my sorrow for him  Does he confound me with the unfeeling crew  Who act my father's bidding Can his love  Pity my grief and bear this wrong with patience  JAQUELINE  I strove in vain to enter Fabian holds him  By the Count's charge in strictest custody  And fearful to awake his master's wrath  Though much unwilling bars me from his presence  ADELAIDE  Unkind old man I would myself entreat him  But fear my earnest look these starting tears  Might to the experience of his prying age  Reveal a secret which in vain I strive  To hide from my own breast  JAQUELINE  Alas dear lady  Did not your tongue reveal it your chang'd mien  Once lighter than the airy woodnymph's shade  Now turn'd to pensive thought and melancholy  Involuntary sighsyour cheek unlike  Its wonted bloom as is the redvein'd rose  To the dim sweetness of the violet  These had too soon betray'd you But take heed  The colour of our fate too oft is ting'd  Mournful or bright but from our first affections  ADELAIDE  Foul disproportion draws down shame on love  But where's the crime in fair equality  Mean birth presumes a mind uncultivate  Left to the coarseness of its native soil  To grow like weeds and die like them neglected  But he was born my equal lineag'd high  And titled as our great ones then his soul  The blood of Valois circling in his veins  Could add no jot to its true royalty  JAQUELINE  How easy is our faith to what we wish  His story may be feign'd  ADELAIDE  I'll not mistrust him  Since the bless'd hour that brought him first to save me  How often have I listen'd to the tale  It varies not for truth 's invariable  He needs no vouchers Gallant generous youth  Thy sport Misfortune from his infant years  Wilt thou pursue him still  JAQUELINE  Indeed 'tis hard  ADELAIDE  But oh the pang that these ungrateful walls  Should be his prison Here if I were aught  His presence should have made it festival  These gates untouch'd had leap'd to give him entrance  And songs of joy made glad the way before him  Instead of this think what has been his welcome  Drag'd by rude hands before a furious judge  Insulted menac'd like the vilest slave  And doom'd unhear'd to ignominious bondage  JAQUELINE  Your father knew not of his service to you  ADELAIDE  No his indignant soul disdain'd to tell it  Great spirits conscious of their inborn worth  Scorn by demand to force the praise they merit  They feel a flame beyond their brightest deeds  And leave the weak to note them and to wonder  JAQUELINE  Suppress these strong emotions The Count's eye  Is quick to find offence Should he suspect  This unpermitted passion 'twould draw down  More speedy vengeance on the helpless youth  Turning your fatal fondness to his ruin  ADELAIDE  Indeed I want thy counsel Yet oh leave me  Find if my gold my gems can ransom him  Had I the world it should be his as freely  I would go kirtled like a villagemaid  Plain all my life in nature's simplest dress  Rather than deck'd with proud superfluous wealth  While one more worthy wanting life's poor means  Upbraids the insulting splendour of abundance  JAQUELINE  Trust to my care The Countess comes to seek you  Her eye is this way bent Conceal this grief  All may be lost if you betray such weakness  Exit  SCENE III  ADELAIDE  alone  O Love thy sway makes me unnatural  The tears which should bedew the grave yet green  Of a dear brother turning from their source  Forget his death and fall for Theodore  SCENE IV  To her the  Countess  COUNTESS  Come near my love When thou art from my side  Methinks I wander like some gloomy ghost  Who doom'd to tread alone a dreary round  Remembers the lost things that made life precious  Yet sees no end of cheerless solitude  ADELAIDE  We have known too much of sorrow yet 'twere wise  To turn our thoughts from what mischance has ravish'd  And rest on what it leaves My father's love  COUNTESS  Was mine but is no more 'Tis pass'd 'tis gone  That ray at least I hoped would never set  My guide my light through Fortune's blackest shades  It was my dear reserve my secret treasure  I stored it up as misers hoard their gold  Sure counterpoise for life's severest ills  Vain was my hope for love's soft sympathy  He pays me back harsh words unkind reproof  And looks that stab with coldness  ADELAIDE  Oh most cruel  And were he not my father I could rail  Call him unworthy of thy wondrous virtues  Blind and unthankful for the greatest blessing  Heaven's everbounteous hand could shower upon him  COUNTESS  No Adelaide we must subdue such thoughts  Obedience is thy duty patience mine  Just now with stern and peremptory briefness  He bade me seek my daughter and dispose her  To wed by his direction  ADELAIDE  The saints forbid  To wed by his direction Wed with whom  COUNTESS  I know not whom He counsels with himself  ADELAIDE  I hope he cannot mean it  COUNTESS  'Twas his order  ADELAIDE  O madam on my knees  COUNTESS  What would my child  Why are thy hands thus rais'd Why stream thine eyes  Why flutters thus thy bosom Adelaide  Speak to me tell me wherefore art thou thus  ADELAIDE  Surprise and griefI cannot cannot speak  COUNTESS  If 'tis a pain to speak I would not urge thee  But can my Adelaide fear aught from me  Am I so harsh  ADELAIDE  Oh no the kindest best  But would you save me from the stroke of death  If you would not behold your daughter stretch'd  A poor pale corse and breathless at your feet  Oh step between me and this cruel mandate  COUNTESS  But this is strangeI hear your father's step  He must not see you thus retire this moment  I'll come to you anon  ADELAIDE  Yet ere I go  O make the interest of my heart your own  Nor like a senseless undiscerning thing  Incapable of choice nor worth the question  Suffer this hasty transfer of your child  Plead for me strongly kneel pray weep for me  And angels lend your tongue the power to move him  Exit  SCENE V  COUNTESS  alone  What can this mean this ecstacy of passion  Can such reluctance such emotions spring  From the mere nicety of maiden fear  The source is in her heart I dread to trace it  Must then a parent's mild authority  Be turn'd a cruel engine to inflict  Wounds on the gentle bosom of my child  And am I doom'd to register each day  But by some new distractionEdmund Edmund  In apprehending worse even than thy loss  My sense confused rests on no single grief  For that were ease to this eternal pulse  Which throbbing here says blacker fates must follow  While Reason just has power enough to whisper  Poor wretch thy peace may come when death comes with it  SCENE VI  To her  Count Austin  COUNT  I sought thee and thou dost prevent me Austin  Welcome thrice welcome By our holy mother  My house seem's hallow'd when thou enter'st it  Tranquillity and peace dwell ever round thee  That robe of innocent white is thy soul's emblem  Made visible in unstain'd purity  Once more thy hand  AUSTIN  My daily task has been  So to subdue the frailties we inherit  That my fair estimation might go forth  Nothing for pride but to an end more righteous  For not the solemn trappings of our state  Tiaras mitres nor the pontiff's robe  Can give such grave authority to priesthood  As one good deed of grace and charity  COUNT  We deem none worthier But to thy errand  AUSTIN  I come commission'd from fair Isabel  COUNT  To me or to the Countess  AUSTIN  Thus to both  For your fair courtesy and entertainment  She rests your thankful debtor You dear Lady  And her sweet friend the gentle Adelaide  Have such a holy place in all her thoughts  That 'twere irreverence to waste her sense  In wordy compliment  COUNTESS  Alas where is she  Till now I scarce had power to think of her  But 'tis the mournful privilege of grief  To stand excus'd from kind observances  Which else neglected might be deem'd offence  AUSTIN  She dwells in sanctuary at Saint Nicholas'  Why she took refuge there  COUNT  Retire Hortensia  I would have private conference with Austin  No second ear must witness  COUNTESS  May I not  By this good man solicit her return  COUNT  Another time it suits not nowRetire  Exit  Countess  SCENE VII  Count Austin  COUNT  You come commission'd from fair Isabel  AUSTIN  I come commission'd from a greater Power  The Judge of thee and Isabel and all  The offer of your hand in marriage to her  With your propos'd divorce from that good lady  That honour'd injur'd lady you sent hence  She has disclos'd to me  COUNT  Which you approve not  So speaks the frowning prelude of your brow  AUSTIN  Approve not Did I not protest against it  With the bold fervour of enkindled zeal  I were the pander of a love like incest  Betrayer of my trust my function's shame  And thy eternal soul's worst enemy  COUNT  Yet let not zeal good man devour thy reason  Hear first and then determine Well you know  My hope of heirs has perish'd with my son  Since now full seventeen years the unfruitful curse  Has fallen upon Hortensia Are these signs  Tremendous signs that startle Nature's order  Graves casting up their sleepers earth convuls'd  Meteors that glare my children's timeless deaths  Obscure to thee aloneI have found the cause  There is no crime our holy Church abhors  Not one high Heaven more strongly interdicts  Than that commixture by the marriage rite  Of blood too near as mine is to Hortensia  AUSTIN  What when the avenging arm is stretch'd abroad  Angry and red at man's enormities  Can more audacious sin dissolve the bolt  To healing dews of peace and blessedness  Too near of blood oh specious mockery  Where have these doubts been buried twenty years  Why wake they now And am I closetted  To sanction them Take back your hasty words  That call'd me wise or virtuous while you offer  Such shallow fictions to insult my sense  And strive to win me to a villain's office  COUNT  The virtue of our churchmen like our wives  Should be obedient meekness Proud resistance  Bandying high looks a port erect and bold  Are from the canon of your order priest  Learn this for here will I be teacher Austin  Our temporal blood must not be stirr'd thus rudely  A front that taunts a scanning scornful brow  Are silent menaces and blows unstruck  AUSTIN  Not so my Lord mine is no priestly pride  When I put off the habit of the world  I had lost all that made it dear to me  And shook off to my best its heat and passions  But can I hold in horrour this ill deed  And dress my brow in falseapproving smiles  No could I carry lightning in my eye  Or roll a voice like thunder in your ears  So should I suit my utterance to my thoughts  And act as fits my sacred ministry  COUNT  O father did you know the conflict here  How Love and Conscience are at war within me  Most sure you would not treat my grief thus harshly  I call the saints to witness were I master  To wive the perfect model of my wish  For virtue and all female loveliness  I would not rove to an ideal form  But beg of heaven another like Hortensia  Yet we must part  AUSTIN  And think you to excuse  A meditated wrong to excellence  By giving it acknowledgement and praise  Rather pretend insensibility  Feign that thou dost not see like other men  Hear'st with peculiar organ hast no relish  For all the good and wise admire in woman  So may abhorrence be exchang'd for wonder  Or men from cursing fall to pity thee  COUNT  You strive in vain no power on earth can shake me  I grant my present purpose seems severe  Yet are there means to smooth severity  Which you and only you can best apply  AUSTIN  Oh no the means hang there there by your side  Enwring your fingers in her flowing hair  And with that weapon drink her heart's best blood  So shall you kill her but not cruelly  Compar'd to this deliberate lingering murder  COUNT  Away with this perverseness Get thee to her  Tell her my heart is hers here deep engrav'd  In characters indelible shall rest  The sense of her perfections Why I leave her  Is not from cloy'd or fickle appetite  For infinite is still her power to charm  But Heaven will have it so  AUSTIN  Oh name not Heaven  'Tis too profane abuse  COUNT  Win her consent  I know thy sway is boundless o'er her will  Then join my hand to blooming Isabel  Thus will you do to all most worthy service  The curse averted thus shall pass from Narbonne  My house again may flourish and proud Godfrey  Who now disputes will ratify my title  Pleas'd with the rich succession to his heirs  AUSTIN  Has passion drown'd all sense all memory  She was affianced to your son young Edmund  COUNT  She never lov'd my son Our importunity  Won her consent but not her heart to Edmund  AUSTIN  Did not that speak her soul preoccupied  Some undivulged and deepfelt preference  COUNT  Ha thou hast rous'd a thought This Theodore  Dull that I was not to perceive it sooner  He is her paramour by heaven she loves him  Her coldness to my son her few tears for him  Her flight this peasant's aiding her all all  Make it unquestionablebut he dies  AUSTIN  Astonishment What does thy frenzy mean  COUNT  I thank thee priest thou serv'st me gainst thy will  That slave is in my power Come follow me  Thou shalt behold the minion's head struck off

ADELAIDE  Oh would I had for then I should not feel  But I have sense enough to know I am wretched  To see the full extent of misery  Yet not enough to teach me how to bear it  JAQUELINE  I did not think your gentleness of nature  Could rise to such extremes  ADELAIDE  Am I not tame  What are these tears this wild dishevel'd hair  Are these fit signs for such despair as mine  Women will weep for trifles bawbles nothing  For very frowardness will weep as I do  A spirit rightly touch'd would pierce the air  Call down invisible legions to his aid  Kindle the elementsBut all is calm  No thunder rolls no warning voice is heard  To tell my frantick father this black deed  Will sink him down to infinite perdition  JAQUELINE  Rest satisfied he cannot be so cruel  Rash as he is to shed the innocent blood  Of a defenceless unoffending youth  ADELAIDE  He cannot be so cruel Earth and heaven  Did I not see the dreadful preparations  The slaves who tremble at my father's nod  Pale and confounded dress the fatal block  But I will fly fall prostrate at his feet  If nature is not quite extinguish'd in him  My prayers my tears my anguish sure will move him  JAQUELINE  Move him indeed but to redoubled fury  He dooms him dead for loving Isabel  Think will it quench the fever of his rage  To find he durst aspire to charm his daughter  ADELAIDE  Did I hear right for loving Isabel  I knew not that before Does he then love her  JAQUELINE  Nothing I heard distinctly wild confusion  Runs thro' the castle every busy fool  All ignorant alike tells different tales  ADELAIDE  Away it cannot be I know his truth  Oh I despise myself that for a moment  Pardon me Love could suffer mean suspicion  Usurp the seat of generous confidence  Think all alike unjust my Theodore  When even thy Adelaide could join to wrong thee  JACQUELINE  Yet be advis'd  ADELAIDE  Oh leave me to my grief  To whom shall I complain He but preserv'd  My life a little space to make me feel  The extremes of joy and sorrow Ere we met  My heart was calm as the unconscious babe  That slumbers cradled 'tween the mother's breasts  From him I learn'd new wishes new affections  To hope to fear to dread enquiring eyes  To find no relish in what pleas'd before  And sigh for bliss that's unattainable  SCENE II  To them  Fabian  FABIAN  Madam my lord comes this way and commands  To clear these chambers what he meditates  'Tis fit indeed were private My old age  Has liv'd too long to see my master's shame  ADELAIDE  His shame eternal shame Oh more than cruel  How shall I smother it Fabian what means he  My fatherhim I speak ofthis young stranger  FABIAN  My heart is rent in pieces deaf to reason  He hears no counsel but from cruelty  Good Austin intercedes and weeps in vain  JAQUELINE  There's comfort

 Austin  AUSTIN  I do believe thee very barbarous  Nay fear thy reason touch'd for such wild thoughts  Such bloody purposes could ne'er proceed  From any sober judgmentyet thy heart  Will sure recoil at this  COUNT  Why think so still  Think me both ruffianlike and lunatick  One proof at least I'll give of temperate reason  Not to be baited from my fix'd design  By a monk's ban or whining intercession  AUSTIN  Thou canst not mean to do it  COUNT  Trust thine eyes  Thybalt bring forth the prisoner bid my marshal  Prepare an axe The ceremony's short  One stroke and all is past Before he die  He shall have leave to thank your godliness  For speeding him so soon from this bad world  AUSTIN  Where is the right the law by which you doom him  COUNT  My will's the law  AUSTIN  A venerable law  The law by which the tyger tears the lamb  And kites devour the dove A lord of France  Dress'd in a little delegated sway  Strikes at his sovereign's face while he profanes  His functions trusted for the general good  COUNT  I answer not to thee  AUSTIN  Answer to heaven  When call'd to audit in that sacred court  Will that supremacy accept thy plea  I did commit soul murder for I might  COUNT  Soar not too high talk of the things of earth  I'll give thee ear Has not thy penitent  Young Isabel disclos'd her passion to thee  AUSTIN  Never  COUNT  Just now her coldness to my son  You said bespoke her heart preoccupied  The frail and fair make you their oracles  Pent in your close confessionals you sit  Bending your reverend ears to luscious secrets  While with their heaving breasts and lovefraught eyes  Devoutly they sigh out each amorous wish  Till flesh and spirit mingling flame with flame  Their glowing senses fix at last on man  And priests may quench the fire a lover kindled  AUSTIN  Scoffer no more stop thy licentious tongue  Turn inward to thy bosom and reflect  COUNT  That is be fool'd  Yet will I grant his life  On one condition  AUSTIN  Name it  COUNT  Join my hand  To Isabel  AUSTIN  Not for the world  COUNT  He dies  SCENE V  To the  Count  and  Austin Theodore  brought in  Come near thou wretch When call'd before me first  With most unwonted patience I endur'd  Thy bold avowal of the wrong thou did'st me  A wrong so great that but for foolish pity  Thy head that instant should have made atonement  But now convicted of a greater crime  Mercy is quench'd therefore prepare to die  THEODORE  Indeed and is this all'tis somewhat sudden  I was a captive long 'mongst infidels  Whom falsely I deem'd savage since I find  Even Tunis and Algiers those nests of ruffians  Might teach civility to polish'd France  If life depends but on a tyrant's frown  COUNT  Out with thy holy trumpery priest delay not  Or if he trusts in Mahomet and scorns thee  Away with him this instant  AUSTIN  Hold I charge you  THEODORE  The turban'd misbeliever makes some show  Of justice in his deadly processes  Nor drinks the sabre blood thus wantonly  Where men are valued less than nobler beasts  Of what am I accused  COUNT  Of insolence  Of bold presumptuous love that dares aspire  To mix the vileness of thy sordid lees  With the rich current of a baron's blood  AUSTIN  My heart is touch'd for himMuch injur'd youth  Suppress awhile this swelling indignation  Plead for thy life  THEODORE  I will not meanly plead  Nor were my neck bow'd to his bloody block  If love's my crime would I disown my love  COUNT  Then by my soul thou diest  THEODORE  And let me die  With my last breath I'll bless her My spirit free  From earth's encumbering clogs shall soar above thee  Anxious as once in life I'll hover round her  Teach her new courage to sustain this blow  And guard her tyrant from thy cruelty  COUNT  Ha give me way  AUSTIN  Why this is madness youth  You but inflame the rage you should appease  THEODORE  He thinks me vile 'Tis true indeed I seem so  But though these humble weeds obscure my outside  I have a soul disdains his contumely  A guiltless spirit that provokes no wrong  Nor from a monarch would endure it offer'd  Uninjur'd lamblike but a lion rous'd  Know too injurious lord here stands before thee  The equal of thy birth  COUNT  Away base clod  Obey me slavesWhat all amaz'd with lies  AUSTIN  Yet hear him Narbonne that ingenuous face  Looks not a lie Thou said'st thou wert a captive  Turn not away we are not all like him  Something I know not what most friendly to thee  Nay more than friendly like a parent's care  And anxious even to pain bids me enquire  THEODORE  My story's brief My mother and myself  I then an infant in my father's absence  Were on our frontiers seiz'd by Saracens  COUNT  A likely tale a welldevis'd imposture  Who will believe thee  AUSTIN  O deceiving hope  A gleam shoots through me and my startled soul  Fearful and eager shrinks from its own wish  I shake and scarce have power enough to beg thee  Go on say all  THEODORE  To the fierce Bashaw Hamet  That scourge and terrour of the Christian coasts  Were we made slaves at Tunis  AUSTIN  Ha at Tunis  Seiz'd with thy mother Lives she gentle youth  THEODORE  Ah no dear saint fate ended soon her woes  In pity ended On her dying couch  She pray'd for blessings on me  AUSTIN  Be thou blessed  O fail not nature but support this conflict  'Tis not delusion sure It must be he  But one thing moredid she not tell thee too  Thy wretched father's name  THEODORE  The lord of Clarinsal  Why do you look so earnestly upon me  If yet he lives and thou know'st Clarinsal  Tell him my tale  AUSTIN  Mysterious providence  COUNT  Aside  What's this the old man trembles and turns pale  THEODORE  He will not let his offspring's timeless ghost  Walk unappeas'd but on this cruel head  Exact full vengeance for his slaughter'd son  AUSTIN  O giver of all good eternal Lord  Am I so bless'd at last to see my son  THEODORE  Let me be deaf for ever if my ears  Deceive me how did he not say his son  AUSTIN  I did I did let this and this convince thee  I am that Clarinsal I am thy father  COUNT  Aside  Why works this foolish moisture to my eyes  Down Nature what hast thou to do with vengeance  THEODORE  Oh sir thus bending let me clasp your knees  Now in this precious moment pay at once  The long long debt of a lost son's affection  COUNT  Aside  Destruction seize them both Must I behold  Their transports ne'er perhaps again to know  A son's obedience or a father's fondness  AUSTIN  Dear boy what miracle preserv'd thee thus  To give thee back to France  THEODORE  No miracle  But common chance A warlike bark of Spain  Bore down and seiz'd our vessel as we rov'd  Intent on spoil for many times alas  Was I compell'd to join their hated league  And strike with infidels My country known  The courteous captain sent me to the shore  Where vain were my fond hopes to find my father  'Twas desolation all a few poor swains  Told me the rumour ran he had renounc'd  A hated world and here in Languedoc  Devoted his remains of life to heaven  AUSTIN  They told thee truth and heaven shall have my prayers  My soul pour'd out in endless gratitude  For this unhoped immeasurable blessing  But thou shalt have my care my love my life  COUNT  Thus far fond man I have listen'd to the tale  And think it as it is a gross contrivance  A trick devis'd to cheat my credulous reason  And thaw me to a woman's milkiness  AUSTIN  And art thou so unskill'd in nature's language  Still to mistrust us Could our tongues deceive  Credit what ne'er was feign'd the genuine heart  Believe these pangs these tears of joy and anguish  COUNT  Or true or false to me it matters not  I see thou hast an interest in his life  And by that link I hold thee Would'st thou save him  Thou know'st already what my soul is set on  Teach thy proud heart compliance with my will  If notbut now no moreHear all and mark me  Keep special guard that none but by my order  Pass from the castle By my hopes of heaven  His head goes off who dares to disobey me  Farewelif he he dear to thee remember  Exit  Count  SCENE VI  Austin Theodore  AUSTIN  If he be dear to me my vital blood  Image of her my soul delighted in  Again she lives in thee Yes 'twas that voice  That kindred look rais'd such strong instinct here  And kindled all my bosom at thy danger  THEODORE  But must we bear to be thus tamely coop'd  By such insulting petty depotism  I look to my unguarded side in vain  Had I a sword  AUSTIN  Think not of vengeance now  A mightier arm than thine prepares it for him  Pass but a little space we shall behold him  The object of our pity not our anger  Yes he must suffer my rapt soul foresees it  Empires shall sink the pond'rous globe of earth  Crumble to dust the sun and stars be quench'd  But O eternal Father of thy will  To the last letter all shall be accomplish'd  THEODORE  So let it be but if his pride must fall  Ye saints who watch o'er loveliness and virtue  Confound not with his crimes her innocence  Make him alone the victim but with blessings  Bright and distinguish'd crown his beauteous daughter  AUSTIN  Well she deserves all blessings nor is he  Exempt from every touch of manly virtue  The natural current of his soul is noble  But passion sometimes will run contrary  As drives the furious eddy 'gainst the stream  But dost thou know the maid  THEODORE  You much surprise me  Did you not hear but now my love confess'd  Avow'd even at the peril of my life  Yes charming Adelaide my heart's first passion  Here thy dear image lives If I renounce her  Let Misery hunt my footsteps thro' the world  And heaven's bright portals shut me out hereafter  AUSTIN  Oh most disastrous love My son my son  Thy words are poniards here Alas I thought  So thought the tyrant and for that he rag'd  The vows exchang'd 'tween Isabel and thee  Thwarted the issue of his wild designs  THEODORE  I knew not Isabel beyond a moment  Pass'd in surprise and haste But thanks to fortune  Let him be still deceiv'd Our loves unknown  My gentle Adelaide escapes his harshness  Some smiling chance again may bring me to her  The same bless'd walls enclose us here perhaps  She walk'd and here even now I tread her footsteps  She spoke she sigh'd I draw the air she breath'd  And with such gales should holy shrines be incens'd  AUSTIN  O had malignant fortune toil'd to blast him  Thus had she snar'd him in this fatal passion  And does young Adelaide return thy love  THEODORE  Bless'd powers she does How can you frown and hear it  Her generous soul first touch'd by gratitude  Soon own'd a kinder warmer sympathy  Soft as the fanning of a turtle's plumes  The sweet confession met my enraptur'd ears  AUSTIN  What can I doCome near my Theodore  Dost thou believe my affection  THEODORE  Can I doubt it  AUSTIN  Think what my bosom suffers when I tell thee  It must not cannot be  THEODORE  My love for Adelaide  AUSTIN  Deem it delicious poison dash it from thee  Thy bane is in the cup  THEODORE  O bid me rather  Tear out my throbbing heart I'd think it mercy  To this unjust this cruel interdiction  That proud unfeeling Narbonne from his lips  Well might such words have fallenbut thou my father  AUSTIN  And fond as ever own'd that tender name  Not I my son not I prevent this union  To me 'tis bitterness to cross thy wish  But nature fate and heaven all all forbid it  Oh when thou know'st what yet is hid in darkness  When the deep mystery of thy birth's unfolded  Thy tears indeed may fall for Adelaide  And I will mingle mine but from that hour  As thou would'st shun perdition must thou fly her  THEODORE  Impossibleand why not now reveal it  Busy imagination tortures worse  Forming conceits more grim and terrible  Than fate can shape in direst certainty  AUSTIN  Not nowill suited is the time the place  We must withdraw where heaven alone can hear us  Then must thou stretch thy soul's best faculties  Call every manly principle to steel thee  And to confirm thy name secure thy honour  Make one great sacrifice of love to justice  Exeunt  End of the Third Act  ACT IV  SCENE I  A Chamber  ADELAIDE  alone  WOE treads on woeThy life my Theodore  Thy threaten'd life sav'd from the impending stroke  Just gave a moment's respite to my heart  And now a mother's grief with pangs more keen  Wakes every throbbing sense and quite o'erwhelms me  Her soul wrapt up in his to talk thus to her  Divorce her leave her wed with Isabel  And call on heaven to sanctify the outrage  How could my father's bosom meditate  What savage tongues would falter even to speak  But see he comes  SCENE II  To her  Austin Jaqueline  O let me bend to thank you  In this extreme distress from you alone  For my poor art is vain can she hope comfort  AUSTIN  How heard she the ill tidings I had hopes  His cooler reason would subdue the thought  And heaven in pity to her gentle virtues  Might spare her knowing how he meant to wrong them  JAQUELINE  The rumour of the castle reach'd her first  But his own lips confirm'd the barbarous secret  Sternly but now he enter'd her apartment  And stamping frown'd her women from her presence  After a little while they had pass'd together  His visage flush'd with rage and mingled shame  He burst into the chamber where we waited  Bade us return and give our lady aid  Then covering his face with both his hands  Went forth like one half craz'd  ADELAIDE  Oh good kind father  There is a charm in holy eloquence  If words can medicine a pang like this  Perhaps may sooth her Sighs and trickling tears  Are all my love can give As I kneel by her  She gazes on me clasps me to her bosom  Cries out my child my child then rising quick  Severely lifts her streaming eyes to heaven  Laughs wildly and half sounds my father's name  Till quite o'erpower'd she sinks from my embrace  While like the grasp of death convulsions seize her  AUSTIN  Remorseless man this wound will reach her heart  And when she falls his last best prop falls with her  And see the beauteous mourner moves this way  Time has but little injur'd that fair fabrick  But cruelty's hard stroke more fell than time  Works at the base and shakes it to the centre  SCENE III  To them the  Countess  COUNTESS  Will then these dreadful sounds ne'er leave my ears  "Our marriage was accurs'd too long we have liv'd  "In bonds forbid think me no more thy husband  "The avenging bolt for that incestuous name  "Falls on my house and spreads the ruin wide  "For our offence o'er this afflicted land"  These were his words  ADELAIDE  O ponder them no more  Lo where the blessed minister of peace  He whose mild counsels wont to charm your care  Is kindly come to cheer your drooping soul  And see the good man weeps  COUNTESS  What weep for me  AUSTIN  Ay tears of blood from my heart's in most core  And count them drops of water from my eyes  Could they but wash out from your memory  The deep affliction you now labour with  COUNTESS  Then still there is some pity left in man  I judged you all by him and so I wrong'd you  I would have told my story to the sea  When it roar'd wildest bid the lioness  Robb'd of her young look with compassion on me  Rather than hoped in any form of man  To find one drop of human gentleness  AUSTIN  approaching her  Most honour'd lady  COUNTESS  Pray you come not near me  I am contagion all some wicked sin  Prodigious unrepented sin has stain'd me  Father 'twould blast thee but to hear the crimes  This woman who was once the wife of Raymond  This curs'd forsaken woman here has acted  AUSTIN  What slanderous tongue dare thus profane your virtue  Madam I know you well and by my order  Each day each hour of your unspotted life  Might give as fair a lesson to the world  As churchmen's tongues can preach or saints could practise  COUNTESS  He charges me with allThou poor Hortensia  What guilt prepost'rous guilt is thine to answer  ADELAIDE  In mercy wound not thus your daughter's soul  AUSTIN  A villain or a madman might say this  COUNTESS  What shall I call him He who was my husband  My child thy fatherHe'll disclaim thee too  But let him cast off all the ties of nature  Abandon us to grief and misery  Still will I wander with thee o'er the world  I will not wish my reason may forsake me  Nor sweet oblivious dulness steep my sense  While thy soft age may want a mother's care  A mother's tenderness to wake and guard thee  ADELAIDE  And if the love of your dear Adelaide  Her reverence duty endless gratitude  For all your angel goodness now can move you  Oh for my sake lest quite you break my heart  Wear but a little outside show of comfort  A while pretend it though you feel it not  And I will bless you for deceiving me  COUNTESS  I know 'tis weakness folly to be mov'd thus  And these I hope are my last tears for him  Alas I little knew deluded wretch  His riotous fancy glow'd with Isabel  That not a thought of me possess'd his mind  But coldness and aversion how to shun me  And turn me forth a friendless wanderer  AUSTIN  Vain were the attempt to palliate injuries  Too foul in their own nature to receive  Whiteness from words but lady for your peace  Think conscience is the deepest source of anguish  A bosom free like yours has life's best sunshine  'Tis the warm blaze in the poor herdsman's hut  That when the storm howls o'er his humble thatch  Brightens his claybuilt walls and cheers his soul  You pay the forfeit of the aggressor's wrong  Suffering the pangs which guilt alone should suffer  COUNTESS  O father reason is for moderate sorrow  For wounds which time has balm'd but mine are fresh  All bleeding fresh and pain beyond my patience  Ungrateful cruel how have I deserv'd it  Thou tough tough heart break for my ease at once  AUSTIN  I scarce methinks can weigh him with himself  Vexations strange have fallen on him of late  And his distemper'd fancy drives him on  To rash designs where disappointment mads him  COUNTESS  Ah no his wit is settled and most subtle  Pride and wild blood are his distemper father  But here I bid farewel to grief and fondness  Let him go kneel and sigh to Isabel  And may he as obdurate find her heart  As his has been to me  AUSTIN  Why that's well said  'Tis better thus than with consuming sorrow  To feed on your own life Give anger scope  Time then at length will blunt this killing sense  And peace he ne'er must know again be your's  COUNTESS  I was a woman full of tenderness  I am a woman stung by injuries  Narbonne was once my husband my protector  He waswhat was he notHe is my tyrant  The unnatural tyrant of a heart that lov'd him  With cool deliberate baseness he forsakes me  With scorn as stedfast shall my soul repay it  AUSTIN  You know the imminent danger threatens him  From Godfrey's fearful claim  COUNTESS  Too well I know it  A fearful claim indeed  AUSTIN  Tomorrow's sun  Will see him at these gates but trust my faith  No violence shall reach you The rash count  Lost to himself by force detains me here  Vain is his forceour holy sanctuary  Whate'er betides shall give your virtue shelter  And peace and piety alone approach you  COUNTESS  O that the friendly bosom of the earth  Would close on me for ever  AUSTIN  These ill thoughts  Must not be cherish'd That all righteous power  Whose hand inflicts knows to reward our patience  Farewel command me ever as your servant  And take the poor man's all my prayers and blessing  Exit  Austin  SCENE IV  Countess Adelaide  ADELAIDE  Will you not strive to rest Alas 'tis long  Since you have slept I'll lead you to your couch  And gently touch my lute to wake some strain  May aid your slumbers  COUNTESS  My sweet comforter  I feel not quite forlorn when thou art near me  ADELAIDE  Lean on my arm  COUNTESS  No I will in alone  My sense is now unapt for harmony  But go thou to Alphonso's holy shrine  There with thy innocent hands devoutly rais'd  Implore his sainted spirit to receive  Thy humble supplications and to avert  From thy dear head the stillimpending wrath  For one black deed that threatens all thy race  Exit  Countess  SCENE V  Adelaide  alone  For thee my prayers shall rise not for myself  And every kindred saint will bend to hear me  But O my fluttering breast'tis Theodore  How sad and earnestly he views that paper  It turns him pale Beshrew the envious paper  Why should it steal the colour from that cheek  Which danger ne'er could blanch He sees me not  I'll wait and should sad thoughts disturb his quiet  If love has power with love's soft breath dispel them  Adelaide  retires  SCENE VI  Theodore  with a paper  My importunity at last has conquer'd  Weeping my father gave and bade me read it  'Tis there he cried the mystery of thy birth  There view thy long divorce from Adelaide  Why should I read it Why with rav'nous haste  Gorge down my bane The worst is yet conceal'd  Then wherefore eager for my own destruction  Enquire a secret which when known must sink me  My eye starts back from it my heart stands still  And every pulse and motion of my blood  With prohibition strong as sense can utter  Cries out  beware  But does my sight deceive  Is it not she Up up you black contents  A brighter object meets my ravish'd eyes  Now let the present moment Love be thine  For ill come when it may must come untimely  SCENE VII  To him  Adelaide  ADELAIDE  Am I not here unwish'd for  THEODORE  My best Angel  Were seas between us thou art still where I am  I bear thy precious image ever round me  As pious men the relicks they adore  Scarce durst I hope to be so blest to see thee  But could not wish a joy beyond thy presence  ADELAIDE  O Theodore what wondrous turns of fortune  Have given thee back to a dear's parent's arms  And spite of all the horrours which surround me  And worse each black eventful moment threatens  My bosom glows with rapture at the thought  Thou wilt at last be bless'd  THEODORE  But one way only  Can I be bless'd On thee depends my fate  Lord Raymond harsh and haughty as he is  And adverse to my father's rigid virtue  When he shall hear our pure unspotted vows  Will yield thee to my wishesbut curs'd stars  How shall I speak it  ADELAIDE  What  THEODORE  That holy man  That Clarinsal whom I am bound to honour  Perversely bids me think of thee no more  ADELAIDE  Alas in what have I offended him  THEODORE  Not so he owns thy virtues and admires them  But with a solemn earnestness that kills me  He urges some mysterious dreadful cause  Must sunder us for ever  ADELAIDE  Oh then fly me  I am not worth his frown be gone this moment  Leave me to weep my mournful destiny  And find some fairer happier maid to bless thee  THEODORE  Fairer than thee Oh heavens the delicate hand  Of nature in her daintiest mood ne'er fashion'd  Beauty so rare Love's roseate deity  Fresh from his mother's kiss breath'd o'er thy mould  That soft ambrosial hueFairer than thee  'Twere blasphemy in any tongue but thine  So to disparage thy unmatch'd perfections  ADELAIDE  No Theodore I dare not hear thee longer  Perhaps indeed there is some fatal cause  THEODORE  There is not cannot be 'Tis but his pride  Stung by resentment 'gainst thy furious father  ADELAIDE  Ah no he is too generous just and good  To hate me for the offences of my father  But find the cause At good Alphonso's tomb  I go to offer up my orisons  There bring me comfort and dispel my fears  Or teach me oh hard thought to bear our parting  Exit  Adelaide  SCENE VIII  Theodore  alone  She's gone and now firm fortitude support me  For here I read my sentence life or death  Takes out the paper  "Thou art the grandson of the good Alphonso  "And Narbonne's rightful lord"Ha is it so  Then has this boist'rous Raymond dar'd insult me  Where I alone should ruleyet not by that  Am I condemn'd to lose her Thou damn'd scroll  I fear thou hast worse poison for my eyes  "Long were the champions bound for Palestine  "Thy grandsire then their chief by adverse winds  "Detain'd in Naples where he saw and lov'd  "And wedded secretly Vicenza's daughter  "For till the holy warfare should be closed  "They deem'd it wise to keep the rite conceal'd  "The issue of that marriage was thy mother  "But the same hour that gave her to the world  "For ever closed the fair one's eyes who bore her  "Foul treason next cut short thy grandsire's thread  "Poison'd he fell  Theodore  pauses and  Austin  who has been some time behind advances  SCENE IX  Austin Theodore  AUSTIN  By Raymond's felon father  Who adding fraud to murder forged a will  Devising to himself and his descendants  Thy rights thy titles thy inheritance  THEODORE  Then I am lost  AUSTIN  Now think unkind young man  Was it for nought I warn'd thee to take heed  And smother in its birth this dangerous passion  The Almighty arm red for thy grandsire's murder  Year after year has terribly been stretch'd  O'er all the land but most this guilty race  THEODORE  The murderer was guilty not his race  AUSTIN  Great crimes like this have lengthen'd punishments  Why speak the fates by signs and prodigies  Why one by one falls this devoted line  Accomplishing the dreadful prophecy  That none should live to enjoy the fruits of blood  Why owning every virtue in the maid  When thou but talk'st of this prepost'rous union  Feels my divining soul such chill reluctance  They are not sent in vain such aweful warnings  But waive this argumentThou wilt be call'd  I know him well all process he disdains  But violence and war to prove thy right  By combat with the Count  THEODORE  In arms I'll meet him  Tomorrow now  AUSTIN  And reeking with his blood  Offer the hand which shed it to his daughter  THEODORE  Ha  AUSTIN  Does it shake thee Come my Theodore  Let not a gust of lovesick inclination  Root like a sweeping whirlwind from thy soul  All the fair growth of noble thoughts and virtue  Thy mother planted in thy early youth  All that good man companion of thy bonds  Thy better father father of thy mind  Whose worth so late was witness'd by thy tears  O rashly tread not down the promis'd harvest  They toil'd to rear to the full height of honour  THEODORE  Would I had liv'd unknown in penury  Rather than thus DistractionAdelaide  SCENE X  To them  Adelaide Fabian  ADELAIDE  Oh whither shall I fly  THEODORE  What means my love  Why thus disturb'd  ADELAIDE  The castle is beset  The superstitious fierce inconstant people  Madder than storms with weapons caught in haste  Menace my father's life rage and revile him  Call him the heir of murderous usurpation  And swear they'll own no rightful lord but Godfrey  AUSTIN  Blind wretches I will hence and try my power  To allay the tumult Follow me my son  Exit  Austin  SCENE XI  Adelaide Theodore Fabian  ADELAIDE  Go not defenceless thus think on thy safety  See yonder porch opes to the armoury  There coats of mailed proof falchions and casques  And all the glittering implements of war  Stand terribly arranged Fabian will guide  And aid to arm thee  THEODORE  Heavens 'twas what I wish'd  Yes Adelaide I go to fight for him  Thy father shall not fall ingloriously  But when he sees this arm strike at his foes  Shall own thy Theodore deserv'd his daughter  Exeunt  Adelaide  at one door  Theodore  and  Fabian  at the other  End of the Fourth Act  ACT V  SCENE I  A Hall  Count Austin Fabian  Attendants with prisoners  Theodore  in armour behind  COUNT  HENCE to a dungeon with those mutinous slaves  There let them prate of prophecies and visions  And when coarse fare and stripes bring back their senses  Perhaps I may relent and turn them loose  To new offences and fresh chastisement  FABIAN  You bleed my lord  Prisoners led out  COUNT  A scratchdeath to be bay'd  By mungrels curs They yelp'd and show'd their fangs  Growl'd too as they would bite But was't not poor  Unlike the generous strain of Godfrey's lineage  To stir the rabble up in nobles' quarrels  And bribe my hinds and vassals to assault me  AUSTIN  They were not stirr'd by Godfrey  COUNT  Who then stirr'd them  Thyself perhaps Was't thou And yet I wrong thee  Thou did'st preach peace and straight they crouch'd and shrunk  More tam'd by the cold med'cine of thy tongue  Than losing the hot drops my steel drew from them  AUSTIN  I might perhaps have look'd for better thanks  Than taunts to pay my serviceBut no matter  My son too serv'd thee nobly he bestrode thee  And drove those peasants back whose staves and clubs  But for his aid had shiver'd that stout frame  But both too well accustom'd to thy transports  Nor ask nor hope thy courtesy  COUNT  Your pardon  I knew my life was saved but not by whom  I wish'd it not yet thank him I was down  Stun'd in the inglorious broil and nought remember  More than the shame of such a paltry danger  Where is he  AUSTIN  Here  Theodore  advances  COUNT  starting  Ha angels shelter me  THEODORE  Why starts he thus  COUNT  Are miracles renew'd  Art thou not risen from the mould'ring grave  And in the aweful majesty of death  'Gainst nature and the course of mortal thought  Assum'st the likeness of a living form  To blast my soul with horrour  THEODORE  Is he mad  Or means he thus to mock me  COUNT  Answer me  Speak some of you who have the power to speak  Is it not he  FABIAN  Who good my lord  COUNT  Alphonso  His form his arms his air his very frown  Lord of these confines speak declare thy pleasure  THEODORE  Dost thou not know me then  COUNT  Ha Theodore  This sameness not resemblance is past faith  All statues pictures or the likeness kept  By memory of good Alphonso living  Are faint and shadowy traces to this image  FABIAN  Hear me my lord so shall the wonder cease  The very arms he wears were once Alphonso's  He found them in the stores and braced them on  To assist you in your danger  COUNT  'Tis most strange  I strive but cannot conquer this amazement  I try to take them off yet still my eyes  Again are drawn as if by magick on him  AUSTIN  aside to  Theodore  Hear you my son  THEODORE  Yes and it wakes within me  Sensations new till now  AUSTIN  Tomorrow's light  Will show him wonders greaterSir it pleas'd you  Wherefore you best can tell to make us here  Your prisoners but the alarm of your danger  Threw wide your gates and freed us We return'd  To give you safeguardMay we now depart  COUNT  Ay to the confines of the farthest earth  For here thy sight unhinges Raymond's soul  Be hid where air or light may never find thee  And bury too that phantom  Exit  Côunt  with his Attendants  SCENE II  Austin Theodore  THEODORE  Insolence  Too proud to thank our kindness yet what horrour  Shook all his frame when thus I stood before him  AUSTIN  No wonder A prediction terrible  Not yet in all fulfill'd hangs over him  And if the presage of my breast deceive not  In thee 'twill be accomplish'd He affects  To call it visionary fear and scorn it  But like a curb in the fierce courser's jaw  The strong controlment mightier than his force  Reins in his pride  THEODORE  'Tis fate then stirs within him  And darkly intimates his hour draws near  But was this all  AUSTIN  The statue of thy grandsire  Thy very figure as thou stood'st before him  Arm'd just as thou art seem'd to move and live  That breathing marble which the people's love  Rear'd near his tomb within our convent's walls  Anon I'll lead thee to it  THEODORE  Let me hence  To shake these trappings off  AUSTIN  Wear them and mark me  Ere night thy kinsman Godfrey will be master  Of all thy story a tried messenger  Bears my dispatch to him not far from hence  Advancing with his train to meet Lord Raymond  He rests till morning He is brave and just  And will support thy claim Should proof and reason  Fail with the usurper thou must try thy sword  And heaven will strike for thee in combat with him  The conscious flash of this thy grandsire's mail  Worse than the horrours of the fabled Gorgon  That curdled blood to stone will shrink his sinews  And cast the wither'd boaster at thy feet  THEODORE  Grant it ye powers but not to shed his blood  The Father of my Adelaide that name  AUSTIN  Is dearer far than minemy words are air  My counsels pass unmark'd But come my son  Tonight my cell must house thee Let me show thee  The humble mansion of thy lonely father  Proud once and prosperous where I have wept and pray'd  And lost in cold oblivion of the world  Twice nine long years thy mother and thyself  And God were all my thoughts  THEODORE  Ay to the convent  For there my love my Adelaide expects me  Aside  Exeunt  SCENE III  Count Fabian  COUNT  By Hell this legend of Alphonso's death  Hourly gains ground  FABIAN  They talk of nought besides  And their craz'd notions are so full of wonder  There's scarce a common passage of the times  But straight their folly makes it ominous  COUNT  Fame that like water widens from its source  Thus often swells and spreads a shallow falsehood  At first a twilight tale of village terrour  The hair of boors and beldams bristled at it  Such bloodless fancies wake to nought but fear  Then heard with grave derision by the wise  And from contempt unsearch'd and unrefuted  It pass'd upon the laziness of faith  Like many a lie gross and impossible  FABIAN  A lie believ'd may in the end my lord  Prove fatal as a written gospel truth  Therefore  COUNT  Take heed and ere the lightning strike  Fly from the sulphurous cloudsI am not dull  For bright as ruddy meteors through the sky  The thought flames here shall light me to my safety  Fabian away Send hither to me straight  Renchild and Thybalt    Exit  FA  They are young and fearless  SCENE IV  Count  alone  Thy flight ungrateful Isabel compels me  To this rude course I would have all with kindness  Nor stain the snowwhite flower of my true love  With spots of violence But it must be so  This lordly priest this Clarinsal or Austin  Like a true churchman by his calling tainted  Prates conscience and in craft abets Earl Godfrey  That Isabel may wed his upstart son  Let Rome dart all her lightnings at my head  Till her grey pontiff singe in his own fires  Spite of their rage I'll force the sanctuary  And bear her off this night beyond their power  My bride if she consents if not my hostage  SCENE V  To the  Count  two Officers  Come hither Sirs Take twenty of your fellows  Post ten at the great gate of Nicholas'  The rest by twos guard every avenue  Leads from the convent to the plain or castle  Charge them and as their lives shall answer it  That none but of my train pass out or enter  FIRST OFFICER  We will my lord about it instantly  COUNT  Temper your zeal and know you orders first  Take care they spill no bloodno violence  More than resisting who would force a passage  The holy drones may buzz but have no stings  I mean to take a bawble from the church  A reverend thief stole from me Near the altar  That place commands the centre of the aile  Keep you your watch If you espy a woman  There can be only she speed to me straight  You'll find my station near Alphonso's porch  Be swift as winds and meet me presently  Exeunt severally  SCENE VI  The inside of a Convent with ailes and Gothick arches part of an altar appearing on one side the statue of  Alphonso  in armour in the centre Other statues and monuments also appearing  Adelaide  veiled rising from her knees before the statue of  Alphonso  ADELAIDE  Alas 'tis mockery to pray as I do  Thoughts fit for heaven should rise on seraphs' wings  Unclog'd with aught of earth but mine hang here  Beginning ending all in Theodore  Why comes he not 'Tis torture for the unbless'd  To suffer such suspense as my heart aches with  What can it bethis secret dreadful cause  This shaft unseen that's wing'd against our love  PerhapsI know not whatAt yonder shrine  Bending I'll seal my irrevocable vow  Hear and record it choirs of saints and angels  If I am doom'd to sigh for him in vain  No second flame shall ever enter here  But faithful to thy fond thy first impression  Turn thou my breast to every sense of joy  Cold as the paleey'd marbles which surround me  Adelaide  withdraws  SCENE VII  Austin Theodore  AUSTIN  Look round my son This consecrated place  Contains the untimely ashes of thy grandsire  With all the impious mockery of grief  Here were they laid by the dire hand which sped him  Since that black hour the thunder scarce has slept  Nature seem'd fearful of her wonted course  As if the angry spirit of Alphonso  Driving the loosen'd orbs in storm and fire  Wreck'd all this elemental vast machine  To break the tenour of men's peaceful souls  There stands his statue were a glass before thee  So would it give thee back thy outward self  THEODORE  And may the power which fashion'd thus my outside  With all his nobler ornaments of virtue  Sustain my soul till generous emulation  Raise me by deeds to equal his renown  And  AUSTIN  To avenge him Not by treachery  But casting off all thoughts of idle love  Of love illmatch'd unhappy ominous  To keep the memory of his wrongs do justice  To his great name and prove the blood you spring from  THEODORE  O were the bold possessor of my rights  A legion arm'd the terrours of his sword  Resistless as the flash that strikes from heaven  Undaunted would I meet him His proud crest  Should feel the dint of no unpractis'd edge  But while my arm assails her father's life  The unnatural wound returns to my own breast  And conquest loses Adelaide for ever  AUSTIN  The barbarous deed of Raymond's father lost her  THEODORE  Pierce not my soul thus Can you love your son  Can you behold these eyes that stream for her  Know every hope or wish my breast can form  My waking thought the murmur of my dreams  All all are Adelaideand coldly tell me  Without one tear unmov'd thus I must lose her  But where where is she  looking out  Heavenly innocence  See the dear saint kneels at the altar's foot  See her white hands with fervent clasps are rais'd  Perhaps for me Have you a heart my father  And bid me bear to lose herHold me not  I come I fly my life my all to join thee  Exit  SCENE VIII  Austin  alone  Return return rash boy Pernicious chance  One glance from her will quite destroy my work  And leave me but my sorrow for my labour  Follows him  SCENE IX  Count  alone  Am I turn'd coward that my tottering knees  Knock as I tread the pavement'Tis the place  The sombrous horrour of these longdrawn ailes  My footsteps are beat back by nought but echo  Struck from the caverns of the vaulted dead  Yet now it seem'd as if a host pursued me  The breath that makes my words sounds thunderlike  Sure 'twas a deepfetch'd groanNohark again  Then 'tis the language of the tombs and see  Pointing to the statue of  Alphonso  Like their great monarch he stands rais'd above them  Who's there  SCENE X  To the  Count  two Officers  FIRST OFFICER  My Lord where are you  COUNT  Herespeak man  Why do you shake thus Death your bloodless cheeks  Send fear into me You Sir what's the matter  SECOND OFFICER  We have found the lady  COUNT  My good fellows where  FIRST OFFICER  Even from this spot you may yourself behold her  Though dim the light but from a winking lamp  A woman's form and habit both are plain  Her face is towards the altar  COUNT

in my sight Come forth come forth  Draws a dagger  Arise grim Vengeance and wash out my shame  Illfated girl A bloody Hymen waits thee  Rushes out  SCENE XI  Two Officers  FIRST OFFICER  His face is black with rage his eyes flash fire  I do not like this service  SECOND OFFICER  No nor I  But if 'tis sin or sacrilege not we  But he who set us on must answer it  FIRST OFFICER  Heard you that shriekIt thunders By my soul  I feel as if my blood were froze within me  Speak to me See he comes  Officers retire  SCENE XII  Count  with a bloody dagger  COUNT  The deed is done  Hark the deep thunder rolls I hail the sign  It tells me in loud greetings I'm reveng'd  SCENE XIII  Theodore  with his sword drawn  THEODORE  Where where's the assassin  AUSTIN  Boy the avenger's here  Behold this dagger smokes with her heart's blood  That thou stand'st there to brave me thank that mail  Or traitor thou had'st felt meBut 'tis done  THEODORE  Oh monstrous monstrous  COUNT  Triumph now o'er Narbonne  Boast how a strippling and a monk deceiv'd  The easy Count but if thou lov'st thy bride  Take that and use it nobly  Throws down the dagger  THEODORE  'Gainst thy heart  Barbarian would I use itbut look there  There are ten thousand daggers  AUSTIN  without  Ring out the alarm  Fly all bring aid if possible to save her  SCENE XIV  To them  Adelaide  wounded and supported by  Austin

Lord my father  Oh bear me to his feet  AUSTIN  Thou man of blood  Past utterance lost see what thy rage has done  COUNT  Ruin despair my child my Adelaide  Art thou the innocent victim of my fury  ADELAIDE  I am indeed I know not my offence  Yet sure 'twas great when my life answers it  Will you forgive me now  COUNT  Oh misery  Had I unnumber'd lives I'd give them all  To lengthen thine an hour What frenzy seized me  That veil the glimmering light my rage deceived me  Unnatural wound detested parricide  Good youth in pity strike this monster dead  ADELAIDE  Listen not to his ravings  To  Theodore  THEODORE  My heart's treasure  Is this the issue of my promis'd joys  'Tis my black destiny has murder'd thee  The stroke was meant for me but my quick hand  Shall speed it home and thus I follow thee  AUSTIN  Hold desperate boy  ADELAIDE  Alas my Theodore  I struggle for a little gasp of breath  Draw it with pain and sure in this last moment  You will observe me  THEODORE  Torture

with pity on this fatal errour  Bless youandoh  Dies  COUNT  She dies in prayer for me  Prays for me while her life streams from my stroke  What prayers can rise for such a wretch as I am  Seize me ye

of being is intolerable  And in a happier world my soul shall join her  Rushes out  AUSTIN  Observe and keep him from all means of death  SCENE XV  Countess  with Women  Fabian  and other Attendants

Esq  Spoken by Miss YOUNGE  OF all the laws by tyrant custom made  The hardest sure are those on authours laid  No easy task in this enlighten'd time  It is with art "to build the lofty rhime"  To

Epilogue had been prepared for it by Mr Malone at the Author's request  'TIS an old maxim with dramatick sages  To draw their tragick lore from distant ages  The ruder manners and impetuous vein  Which no trim rules of  etiquette  restrain  The gen'rous plainness of th' unpractis'd heart  Nature's free powers yet unsubdued by art  The rough simplicitythe darksome time  Improve the  pathos  heighten the sublime  While all the Poet's deepest skill might fail  If us'd to decorate some modern tale  In me you've seen a wifewho though abhorr'd  Abandon'd threaten'd by her tyrant Lord  Did patient long her firm affection prove  'Midst the keen tortures of insulted love  You've seen a maidenfair and nobly born  Attach'd to merit wretched and forlorn  And then her lover in a mean disguise  In native worth above all titles rise  A priestwith zeal and holy ardour fraught  Practise the lessons which his preaching taught  But while at scenes like these your bosoms glow  You'll recollect they happen'dlong ago  In  our  gay times a wife forsaken scorn'd  Had ne'er in doleful guise her fortune mourn'd  But with frail schemes in fashionable course  Had been the  first  to furnish a divorce  The maiden had her peasant swain despis'd  And stars and lace and liv'ries more had priz'd  Nor could in this perhaps her choice be blam'd  For say what lover now had other merit claim'd  As for our priestsin rev'rence let them rest  On modern saintsthe least that's said is best  Of manners then so different in their kind  The old are rudethe new are too refin'd  That author well deserves our warmest praise  Who those examples which we need displays  Who 'midst the placid murmurings of  Ton  Rolls the rough tide of Gothick force along  And when true worth seems withering at the root  Turns the rich soil whence towering virtues shoot  Ne'er can the Muse be more our nature's friend  Than when she strives its wide extremes to blend  Bids simple truth with polish'd fashion join  And ancient strength with modern grace combine  FINIS
