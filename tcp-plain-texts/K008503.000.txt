 RETALIATION A POEM By DOCTOR GOLDSMITH INCLUDING EPITAPHS ON THE MOST Distinguished WITS of this METROPOLIS  LONDON Printed for G KEARSLY at N  o  in FleetStreet MDCCLXXIV  TO M  R  KEARSLY BOOKSELLER in FLEETSTREET  SIR  I  Am unable to account for the Mystery with which the  POEM  I send you has been handed aboutIn some part of Doctor  GOLDSMITH's  Works he confesses himself so unable to resist the hungry Attacks of wretched Compilers that  he contents himself with the Demand of the fat Man who when at Sea and the Crew in great Want of Provisions was pitched on by the Sailors as the properest Subject to supply their Wants He found the Necessity of Acquiescence at the same Time making the most reasonable Demand of the first Cut off himself for  himself  When the Doctor in his Lifetime was forced by these Anthropophagi to such Capitulations what Respect can we  now  expect from them will they not dine on his memory To rescue him from this Insult I send you an authentic Copy of the last poetic Production of this Great and Good Man of which I recommend an early Publication to prevent spurious Editions being ushered into the World  Dr Goldsmith  belonged to a Club of  Beaux Esprits  where Wit  sparkled sometimes at the Expence of Goodnature It was proposed to write Epitaphs on the Doctor his Country Dialect and Person furnished Subjects of Witticism The Doctor was called on for  Retaliation  and at their next Meeting produced the following Poem which I think adds one Leaf to his immortal Wreath  RETALIATION A POEM  OF old when Scarron his companions invited  Each guest brought his dish and the feast was united  If our landlord supplies us with beef and with fish  Let each guest bring himself and he brings the best dish  Our Dean shall be venison just fresh from the plains  Our Burke shall be tongue with a garnish of brains  Our Will shall be wild fowl of excellent flavour  And Dick with his pepper shall heighten their savour  Our Cumberland's sweetbread its place shall obtain  And Douglass's pudding substantial and plain  Our Garrick's a sallad for in him we see  Oil vinegar sugar and saltness agree  To make out the dinner full certain I am  That Ridge is anchovy and Reynolds is lamb  That Hickey's a capon and by the same rule  Magnanimous Goldsmith a goosberry fool  At a dinner so various at such a repast  Who'd not be a glutton and stick to the last  Here waiter more wine let me sit while I'm able  'Till all my companions sink under the table  Then with chaos and blunders encircling my head  Let me ponder and tell what I think of the dead  Here lies the good Dean reunited to earth  Who mixt reason with pleasure and wisdom with mirth  If he had any faults he has left us in doubt  At least in six weeks I could not find 'em out  Yet some have declar'd and it can't be denied 'em  That slyboots was cursedly cunning to hide 'em  Here lies our good Edmund whose genius was such  We scarcely can praise it or blame it too much  Who born for the Universe narrow'd his mind  And to party gave up what was meant for mankind  Tho' fraught with all learning kept straining his throat  To persuade Tommy Townsend to lend him a vote  Who too deep for his hearers still went on refining  And thought of convincing while they thought of dining  Tho' equal to all things for all things he's fit  Too nice for a statesman too proud for a wit  For a patriot too cool for a drudge disobedient  And too fond of the  right  to pursue the  expedient  In short 'twas his fate unemploy'd or in play Sir  To eat mutton cold and cut blocks with a razor  Here lies honest William whose heart was a mint  While the owner ne'er knew half the good that was in't  The pupil of impulse it forc'd him along  His conduct still right with his argument wrong  Still aiming at honour yet fearing to roam  The coachman was tipsy the chariot drove home  Would you ask for his merits alas he had none  What was good was spontaneous his faults were his own  Here lies honest Richard whose fate I must sigh at  Alas that such frolic should now be so quiet  What spirits were his what wit and what whim  Now breaking a jest and now breaking a limb  Now rangling and grumbling to keep up the ball  Now teazing and vexing yet laughing at all  In short so provoking a Devil was Dick  That we wish'd him full ten times a day at Old Nick  But missing his mirth and agreeable vein  As often we wish'd to have Dick back again  Here Cumberland lies having acted his parts  The Terence of England the mender of hearts  A flattering painter who made it his care  To draw men as they ought to be not as they are  His gallants are all faultless his women divine  And comedy wonders at being so fine  Like a tragedy queen he has dizen'd her out  Or rather like tragedy giving a rout  His fools have their follies so left in a croud  Of virtues and feelings that folly grows proud  And coxcombs alike in their failings alone  Adopting his portraits are pleas'd with their own  Say where has our poet this malady caught  Or wherefore his characters thus without fault  Say was it that vainly directing his view  To find out mens virtues and finding them few  Quite sick of pursuing each troublesome elf  He grew lazy at last and drew from himself  Here Douglas retires from his toils to relax  The scourge of impostors the terror of quacks  Come all ye quack bards and ye quacking divines  Come and dance on the spot where your tyrant reclines  Where Satire and Censure encircl'd his throne  I fear'd for your safety I fear'd for my own  But now he is gone and we want a detector  Our Dodds shall be pious our Kenricks shall lecture  Macpherson write bombast and call it a style  Our Townshend make speeches and I shall compile  New La  ders and Bowers the Tweed shall cross over  No countryman living their tricks to discover  Detection her taper shall quench to a spark  And Scotchman meet Scotchman and cheat in the dark  Here lies David Garrick describe me who can  An abridgment of all that was pleasant in man  As an actor confest without rival to shine  As a wit if not first in the very first line  Yet with talents like these and an excellent heart  The man had his failings a dupe to his art  Like an ill judge in beauty his colours he spread  And beplaister'd with rouge his own natural red  On the stage he was natural simple affecting  'Twas only that when he was off he was acting  With no reason on earth to go out of his way  He turn'd and he varied full ten times a day  Tho' secure of our hearts yet confoundedly sick  If they were not his own by finessing and trick  He cast off his friends as a huntsman his pack  For he knew when he pleased he could whistle them back  Of praise a mere glutton he swallowed what came  And the puff of a dunce he mistook it for fame  'Till his relish grown callous almost to disease  Who pepper'd the highest was surest to please  But let us be candid and speak out our mind  If dunces applauded he paid them in kind  Ye Kenricks ye Kellys and Woodfalls so grave  What a commerce was yours while you got and you gave  How did Grubstreet reecho the shouts that you rais'd  While he was berossia'd and you were beprais'd  But peace to his spirit wherever it flies  To act as an angel and mix with the skies  Those poets who owe their best fame to his skill  Shall still be his flatterers go where he will  Old Shakespeare receive him with praise and with love  And Beaumonts and Bens be his Kellys above  Here Hickey reclines a most blunt pleasant creature  And slander itself must allow him goodnature  He cherish'd his friend and he relish'd a bumper  Yet one fault he had and that one was a thumper  Perhaps you may ask if that man was a miser  I answer no no for he always was wiser  Too courteous perhaps or obligingly flat  His very worst foe can't accuse him of that  Perhaps he confided in men as they go  And so was too foolishly honest ah no  Then what was failing come tell it and burn ye  He was could he help it a special attorney  Here Reynolds is laid and to tell you my mind  He has not left a better or wiser behind  His pencil was striking resistless and grand  His manners were gentle complying and bland  Still born to improve us in every part  His pencil our faces his manners our heart  To coxcombs averse yet most civilly staring  When they judged without skill he was still hard of hearing  When they talk'd of their Raphaels Corregios and stuff  He shifted his trumpet and only took snuff  * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * *

distinguished in all the branches of useful and polite literature  "Now  breaking a jest  and now  breaking a limb"  page line the above Gentleman having slightly fractured one of his arms and legs at different times the Doctor has rallied him on those accidents as a kind of  retributive  justice for breaking his jests upon other people  "Here  Cumberland  lies" page line Doctor Richard Cumberland

his character  vide  the Poem  "Here  Hickey  reclines" page line A gentleman whose hospitality and goodhumour have acquired him in this Club the title of 'honest Tom Hickey' His profession the Doctor tells us is that of an attorney but whether he meant the words an echo to the sense or not he has told us so in perhaps the only indifferent couplet of the whole Poem To soften this censure however in some respect the English Reader is to be told that the phrase of "burn ye" in the th line of the th page tho' it may seem  forced  to rhyme to "attorney" is a familiar method of salutation in Ireland amongst the lower classes of the people  "He shifted his Trumpet and only took snuff" page the last line the last Sir Joshua Reynolds on whom this observation was made is so remarkably deaf as to be under the necessity of using an ear trumpet mostly in company he is at the same time equally remarkable for using a great quantity of snuff his manner in both of which taken in the point of time described must be allowed by those who have been witnesses of such a scene to be as happily given upon  Paper  as that great Artist himself perhaps could exhibit upon  Canvass  ERRORS  A few copies
