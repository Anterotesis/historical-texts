 THE General History OF PRINTING FROM  Its first Invention in the City of MENTZ  TO Its first PROGRESS and PROPAGATION thro' the most celebrated Cities in  Europe  Particularly  Its Introduction Rise and Progress here in  England THE Character of the most celebrated PRINTERS from the first Inventors of the Art to the Years and with an Account of their Works and of the most considerable Improvements which they made to it during that Interval  BY  S PALMER  PRINTER  LONDON  Printed by the Author and sold by his Widow at his late  PrintingHouse  in  Bartholomewclose  also by  J ROBERTS  in  Warwicklane  and by most  Booksellers  in Town and Country M DCC XXXII  PREFACE  _AS it is very natural and commendable for every man to be ever inquiring after any discovery or improvement that may be useful to his profession and to communicate it to the publick I am willing to hope that the care and pains the time and expence I have bestow'd on the following History will be approv'd by every one who considers the nature use and extent of it and the rather because nothing has been yet publish'd at least in  English  on the subject of  PRINTING  so methodical and comprehensive either in the  Historical  or  Practical  part of it As to the History I could not without some regret observe that we had nothing in our own language but some few fragments dispers'd in several Authors who only spoke of it occasionally whilst so many  Italians Germans  and  French  had wrote so copiously upon it and  ex professo  Tho' even these seem rather to have had a view to the introduction and progress of the Art in their respective countries than to the displaying of its excellency and improvements Neither did I find that any of them had given so particular a History of the Invention and Inventors or so general a one of its progress and promulgation through  Europe  and beyond it as I could have wish'd or as I thought might be compiled  However neither these considerations nor the discoveries I had made from some ancient and valuable editions I met with in some of our noble libraries nor even the examples of several men of my profession abroad who have writ largely on both the subjects could have prevail'd upon me to have undertaken this  Historical  part which I knew deserved a much better pen The  Practical  being more within my province my ambition reached no higher than to have published such a compleat system of it from the helps I had received from Mr  Fertel  and Mr  Jn Andr Endters  two eminent Printers the first at St  Omer  's and the other at  Nuremberg  who have published two curious treatises of it and from my own observations and improvements on them as few of my profession would have fail'd of being the better for in some branch or other of the Art And I could with the utmost pleasure have communicated all the other discoveries which I had occasionally made to any person that would have been at the pains of writing this History But when I discover'd my design I found to my surprise that the Practical part would not meet with that encouragement and approbation I expected particularly from those for whose benefit and improvement I had chiefly design'd it tho' the publick could not but have been the better for it by having much better and neater impressions than are generally done  Upon this account my friends and patrous persuaded me to alter my Design and to suspend the Practical part till the Historical which they press'd me also to undertake had in some measure made way for it Pursuant therefore to this new plan I resolved to spare neither cost nor pains to get a sight or at least a certain intelligence of all the Old editions that were valuable either for their antiquity elegancy or for any light they could give me into this History and to add my own  observations upon them not only as an historian but more especially as a  PRINTER  The Reader will find by the sequel that none but one of that profession and one that is well vers'd in those old ancient works can form a right judgment of them and this is the reason that so many of them have been mistaken for Manuscripts or have been supposed to have been printed upon wooden blocks even by persons otherwise very learned and judicious whereas it is even demonstrable that they were done by separate metal types  My next care was to read over all that has been writ hitherto upon the subject especially by the judicious  Malinkrot  by  De la Caille Chevilier Endters P Pater Orlandi  and by the learned Mr  Maittaire  from all whom the Reader will find I have received no small helps and which I do here gladly acknowledge and if I have at any time ventured to dissent from them I hope he will find my opinion back'd with sufficient authority but where that could not be obtained I have contented myself with leading the Reader to the most probable side And it is with no small pleasure that I have found one or two of my conjectures since confirm'd by the discovery of some latent pieces which were not known to them They had indeed access to the most celebrated Libraries of their own countries but this History will convince them that all that is valuable and curious is not confined to them and that we have many as nobly and richly furnish'd in our own as any in theirs  And here I should be extremely ungrateful if I did not take this opportunity of acknowledging the great helps and curious informations I have been favour'd with by several of the Patrons and Encouragers of this work as well as my great obligations to the Right Honourable the Earls of  Pembroke  and  Oxford  to whom I am proud to own myself beholden but more especially  to the former for all the discoveries which this History has above any other extant My free access to those two Libraries as well as to those of my very good friends Dr  Mead  Dr  Rawlinson  Mr  Richardson  and others besides some of our publick ones such as those of  Oxford Cambridge  and of the  Middle Temple  have afforded me the satisfaction of seeing many of those scarce editions which have been mention'd by most Annalists if we except Mr  Maittaire  either from Catalogues or hearsay And here I gladly take this opportunity of returning my thanks to these learned Correspondents who have favour'd me with any ourious intelligence from those Libraries which my Business and the bad state of health would not permit me to visit  The order of this History is as follows  The first book contains an account of the Discovery and Inventors of the Art whether really such or only pretended with remarks on their first tryals upon Blocks and their first editions  The second book treats of the promulgation of  PRINTING  into all the several cities and places in  Europe  and the improvements made to it by the most eminent Printers down to  An  The third gives an account of its first introduction into  England  its rise and progress in several cities towns and monasteries with the characters and works of the most famous  English  Printers to  an  a fuller account of all which may be seen in the following  Table of CONTENTS  This Performance I entirely submit to the approbation or censure of the curious and candid as it shall deserve And I shall gain the main end I propos'd if what I have done shall contribute to some more full and elaborate productions of this nature  Thus far Mr PALMER's  Preface  to the Historical part as to what relates to the Practical we need not trouble the Reader with it here What the Author design'd to treat of in it may be seen by the  Table of Contents  prefix'd to the first Number of this work In this Table he will likewise find several particulars which were promis'd to be added to this History but which we have been obliged to omit either for want of materials or because they were not thought so necessary to this work by the promoters of it Of the first sort was the  History of Printing  in  Scotland  and  Ireland  concerning the former of which we can add nothing to the short account which was printed at  Edenburgh  by Mr  Watson  the King's Printer there and as for  Ireland  we are still more in the dark for want of Memoirs Mr PALMER had likewise promis'd the Prints of the  Rebus's  of all the foreign eminent PRINTERS but as he had not got them cut before his death and has given an account of them at the end of their works it was thought that charge might as well be spared so that we have only added those which were used by the most considerable ones of our own nation His list of the most excellent PRINTERS from to this time the several acts for regulating the Press and for securing the property of Copies being left very imperfect the charge of finishing them was likewise thought unnecessary for which reason they are also omitted  All that needs be added with regard to his Practical part is that as it was intended to have been printed first the Author has left it in such perfect order that if the Publick will be pleased to encourage it an Edition may be easily printed from his Manuscript 'Twere needless to tell the world how fit he was for such a work what pains he has taken and what improvements he made to it those who knew Mr PALMER will think it sufficient to say that the subject is the  Art of Printing  and he the Author of it  THE  CONTENTS  BOOK I  CHAP I AN enquiry into the

A GENERAL History of Printing  BOOK I Of its Origin Improvement and Progress by JOHN FAUST from to  CHAP I An Enquiry into the Rise of Printing  _MY design is to give an historical account of the authors discovery improvement and progress of the Art of Printing an Art so highly beneficial to mankind by preserving and transmitting to posterity the treasures of antient and modern learning that its original has been esteem'd divine I shall begin with a previous enquiry into the causes and concurrent circumstances which excited the inventors of it to a discovery that might answer this end with more expedition and exactness than  Transcribing  the only method known before  THE world at this time began to recover from a state of ignorance under which it had labour'd many centuries learning reviv'd and was patroniz'd in almost every country of  Europe  its votaries exerted a laudable zeal in searching the libraries for those valuable books which had lain buried in obscurity and were become extremely scarce great numbers being lost in the times of ignorance Manuscripts were procur'd and multiplied but the price of them was such that none but men of fortune could purchase them crowns for a  Livy  and crowns for three volumes of  Plutarch  's Lives  De tribus voluminibus PLUTARCHI in quibus parallela viginti quatuor continentur titulos sumpsit ut mones pretium minus LXXX aureis esse non potest c  Papiens  p vet edit  was then a moderate price a few manuscripts were thought a portion worthy a nobleman's daughter and one or two intitled the donor and his posterity to the perpetual prayers of a monastery nay kings themselves disdain'd not the office of procuring them for their learned friends as appears from a letter of  Antoninus Bocatellus  sirnam'd  Panormus  to  Alphonsus  king of  Naples  and  Sicily  Significasti mihi nuper ex Florentia extare TITI LIVII opera vaenalia libros pulcherrimos libro pretium esse CXX aureos Quare majestatem tuam oro ut LIVIUM quem regem librorum appellare consuevimus emi nomine meo ac venire ad nos facias interim ego pecuniam procurabo quam pro libri pretio tradam Sed illud a prudentia tua sciae desidero uter ego an Pegnius melius fecerit is ut villam Florentiae emeret LIVIUM vendidit quem sua manu pulcherrime scripserat ego ut LIVIUM emam fundum proscripsi Haec ut familiariter a te peterem suasit humanitas modestia tua Vale triumpha  Epistel  lib  and an old  manuscript hebrew bible  was a present from the Emperor  Frederick  III to  Reuchlin  who was sent embassador to him  Paulus Jovius  relates a pleasant story of one  Jason Mainus  a student of  Pavia  whose extravagance having brought him to a goal was oblig'd to deposit a manuscript  Codex Juris  on parchment into the hands of an usurer in order to procure his enlargement  Petrarch  's rhetoric master likewise by pledging two volumes of  Cicero  's works sav'd himself from a prison  As this excessive price tempted some to purchase estates by the sale of their books and exchange learning for money so the learned at that time freely parted with their wealth to procure those invaluable remains of antiquity out of a generous design to communicate them to the world  THE Transcribers now had a favourable opportunity of enriching themselves which they might have enjoy'd much longer had not they possess'd with the most mercenary views done an incredible and in some cases irrecoverable  damage to learning by mutilating and corrupting the best authors hence arise those frequent complaints against their negligence and ignorance which have cost the learned an infinite deal of labour to remedy to evince this the following instance will suffice  JOHN ANDREAS bishop of  Aleria  one of the greatest criticks of that age tells Pope  Paul  II in his dedication prefix'd to  Pliny  's  Natural History  In nonum annum premi non potuit emendatio ne futura quidem exacta post nonagesimum  printed at  Rome  in the house of the  Maximis  by  Panaratz  and  Sweynheim anno  that tho' he had spent nine whole years in correcting that author yet ninety more would not compleat a correct edition This demonstrates what difficulties the republick of learning encounter'd with at it's revival namely the scarcity and excessive price of books and the sordidness of the Transcribers from whose hands they came so maim'd and incorrect that the great Printer  Stephens  truly said  they were a plague to the purchaser  These were motives sufficient to excite the Inventors of this Art to a discovery so beneficial to the world and of such honour and advantage to themselves who those excellent persons were and where it was made will come under our enquiry in its proper place And here the reader will find just cause of wonder that this Art which has been stiled the nurse and preserver of arts and sciences should if I may use the expression be so forgetful of itself as not to leave us the least sketch of its own history the inventors being  more ambitious of deserving than of purchasing praise  Some light indeed we receive in this affair from a few inscriptions used by  Faust  at the end of his first printed books to this purpose  This present work with all its embellishments  c  was done not with pen and ink  c  but by a new invented Art of casting Letters Printing  c  by me  John Faust  and my soninlaw  Peter Schoeffer  in the famous city of  Mentz  upon the  Rhine  anno  but recourse must be had to the writers of those times for the history of this Invention Many cities have contended for the glory of it and engaged the learned in defence of their claim but those on the side of  Harlem  have manag'd the controversy with great warmth and charged  Faust  the Inventor with robbing his supposed master  Laurence John Coster  of many thousand weight of his materials on ChristmasEve when the whole family and city were in prayer at church with other such ridiculous stories invented meerly to deprive this  Great Man  of the honour which he had so  long incontestably enjoy'd Had this been publish'd in his lifetime when he might have defended himself or presently after his death when his soninlaw or some of his friends might have done it for him he had undoubtedly been clear'd but such an accusation was not hinted till years after and then grounded only on suspicion as Dr  Junius  owns  Ut fert suspicio  who was the first that attempted to transfer this Discovery from  Mentz  to  Harlem  However  Faust  's name died not with him tho' some  Dutch  writers made use of  his art  to asperse his memory and others of several nations rose immediately in his defence in particular the learned  Malincrot  dean of  Munster  in his treatise  De Ortu Progressu Artis Typographicae  has not only refuted what was advanc'd on the other side but made such researches after the old monuments of the Art and collected so great a variety of testimonies supported by undeniable facts as seem at once to determine the controversy  Boxhorn  indeed attempted an answer but whoever reads it over cannot but be convinc'd that an overfondness for his country's honour has made him deaf to the most evident demonstrations of his antagonist However as he and his followers have given up the point as to separate Metal Types in favour of  John Faust  and lay claim only to the invention of  Printing on Blocks of Wood  which they affirm to have been stoln from  Coster  by  Faust  whose next invention they would have to be only an improvement of the former I shall give the reader an idea of both and shew the difference between those first essays of Printing and that perfect one which succeeded and continues to this day  CHAP II An Account of the different Manners of Printing by  Blocks of Wood  and separate Metal Types  TIS agreed by most writers on this subject that about the year several attempts were made by some persons with vast expence and labour which prov'd abortive but that the discovery of separate Metal Types was not brought to perfection till about the year We find that their first essays were by carving or cutting letters with a sharppointed knife upon Blocks of Wood each Block containing a page or one side of a leaf that instead of the common  Ink which is the sort they first us'd they invented a more glutinous one which succeeded better being less apt to spread that they pasted the two white sides of each leaf together to make them look like single leaves but of this I shall have occasion to speak more particularly in some of the following chapters In the mean time I shall endeavour to demonstrate that this invention has not that merit for ingenuity usefulness or novelty which the  Dutch  writers boast of  WITH respect to the first the only requisites are a tolerable genius sharp tools and a good copy as to its usefulness the only advantage resulting from it is that whatever the book be the forms remain intire so that as many editions as the author pleases may be printed without the expence of a new composition but on the other hand if we consider that those forms are of no use to any other work and the time and expence in cutting them very great with the great space so many Pages of Wood must take up we shall perceive the necessity of inventing moveable Metal Types But farther this method of Printing was far from being novel it is even demonstrable from authentick testimonies to have been practis'd in  China  and  Japan  above four centuries before it was known in  Europe  it is not easy I grant to prove that we receiv'd it from them because of their vast distance and the little commerce between us before the year yet there is no impossibility but that it might have been brought us by some merchant either by the way of  Muscovy  or the  RedSea  the  Persian Gulph  or  Arabia  of which opinion I could mention many authors  Gonzala de Mendosa  in his history of the  Marvels of China  written in Spanish Book III Chap and  Martin Martini  in his  Atlas Sinensis  tell us that they could prove by good arguments that the Invention of  Guns  of the  Loadstone  and  Printing  was known to us by their means What adds to the probability of my conjecture is that the  Chinese  to this day send with their goods printed papers in the manner of our shopkeepers handbills several of which I have seen and 'tis not impossible but the hint of Printing on Blocks of Wood might have been taken this way  WHOEVER has a just idea of the genius of the  Chinese  and  Japonese  will own their capacity to have invented the method of Printing with separate types if their manner of writing had admitted it but as they are known to write not with letters as other nations but with characters each of  which stands for a whole word and that the number of those characters amount at least to tho' some authors reckon above it would be impossible to have cases large enough to contain 'em besides the insuperable difficulty of distinguishing and retaining them in memory To return from this digression let us now take a short view of the other new and more expeditious method  IF we duely consider it in all its branches it will evidently appear the result of no small study time and cost The cutting the counterpunches and punches and sinking them into the matrices the adjusting them to the mould that curious piece of mechanism for casting single letters the difficulty of the whole manual operation of Letterfounding in the Printing the disposition of the cases the curious contrivance of the several parts of the work between the compositors correctors and pressmen  c  add to all this the fine invention of the Printingpress so admirable for its mechanical fabrick together with the curious apparatus necessary for a Printinghouse for an explication of whose terms we must refer to the second volume of this work these are things which require a genius vastly superior to devise better hands to execute greater forecast to obviate and readiness to remedy all unexpected defects more time and patience to go thro' all its various parts more resolution to overcome all difficulties and lastly the expences necessary to this invention vastly larger than those of the former and consequently we shall be far from thinking an interval of ten years too long but rather admire that such a prodigious design could be contriv'd and perfected in so short a time  WHAT has been said on this head will sufficiently demonstrate the disparity between these two methods and convince the reader how much the former is inferior in every respect to the latter nay if we dare rely on the judgment of the learned we should scarce think it worthy the name of Printing since it has nothing common with it except the ink and even a rowler cover'd with cloath would supply the place of a press to print their Pages of Wood  NOW whether it be  Faust  or  Coster  who practis'd this method on wood first whether  Mentz Harlem  or any other city gave it first encouragement whether the aforenam'd persons had the hint from  China  or happen'd on it accidentally tho' if we admit of the latter supposition  Faust  and  Mentz  have the better title this must be granted from what has  been said that by Printing we do not understand the method of Printing on Blocks of Wood claim'd by  Harlem  but the present Art of Printing by separate Metal Types which is so justly admir'd for its expeditious and correct way of preserving and propagating knowledge and to which we owe the improvements made in most arts and sciences for near three centuries past  HENCE it appears how little reason the  Dutch  writers have to value themselves upon an imaginary victory which were it granted in its fullest extent would be despicable in comparison of the other Yet  Boxhorn  in his  Theatrum Hollandiae  page places his hero  Coster  in a kind of triumphal chariot dragging his vanquish'd enemies the  Germans  and  French  after him with a pompous inscription which I think worthy the curious readers notice  Quem  Flos urbium  HARLEMUM  Patritia familia edidit  LAURENTIO COSTERO  Qui incredibili prope inhumana  Ingenii felicitate  Moguntinis nequidquam negantibus    Gallis frustra obstrepentibus  ARTEM TYPOGRAPHICAM  Primus invenit  MONUMENTUM  hoc  L M P Q  Typis  Posuimus  He exults as if every sentence in that book was demonstration and imposes an eternal silence on all those nations which have appear'd in defence of  Mentz  in a stanza of short verses after the manner of  Claudian  which for its singularity is likewise here quoted  Serrarii libelli  Streperi tacete Galli  Taceat sonourus autor  Solus Ovantem Batavus  Emeditatus artem  Haec vox aetheriis insonet axibus  Haec vox per populos per mare transeat  HARLEMUS Typicam prodidit artifex  However I perswade my self that two or three of the following chapters will convince us of the vanity of these triumphs unless this piece of divinity and poetry compos'd by  Scriverius  shall alter our sentiments it contains four verses to be plac'd under  Coster  's statue and cited in the  Theatrum Holland  abovementioned p  Vana quid archetypos praela  Moguntia  jactas  Harlemi  archetypos praelaque nata scias  Extulit hic monstrante deo  Laurentius  artem  Dissimulare virum hunc dissimulare deum est  I shall only inform the  English  reader that the author of them pronounces it as rank atheism to deny  Coster  the glory of this invention as to deny God that of the creation I shall now leave  Harlem  and the  Dutch  writers and pass over to the city  of  Mentz  to examine the testimonies brought in favour of her after having return'd  Boxhorn  four lines from a learned  Italian  poet who may be suppos'd a more impartial witness in this controversy  Abstulerat  Latio  multos  Germania  libros  Nunc multo plures reddidit ingenio  Et quod vix toto quisquam perscriber et anno  Munere  Germanica  conficit una dies  Laur Valla    CHAP III Testimonies of writers from the middle of the th century in favour of  John Faust    MALINCROT hath collected the testimonies of writers on either side of the controversy from the promulgation of the art to the time in which he wrote  viz ann  and rang'd them in the beginning of his book in the following order  Those who declar'd for  Mentz  before the dispute was started by Dr  Junius  and quoted by him in that work    Those who have written on the same side since  Junius         Those who have written in favour of  Harlem    Those who are neuters    BY this list 'tis manifest where the advantage lies as to numbers but lest so many testimonies should be thought tedious it will not we hope be improper to select the most considerable especially from those authors who wrote soon after the discovery and were better acquainted with this matter than those who liv'd any time after it and may be justly suppos'd to have follow'd their predecessors But I would therefore avoid as much as possible clogging or interrupting the thread of this history I shall only extract the most material authorities out of them and in such a manner as shall be consistent with it by inserting the passages themselves in the notes that the reader may use his pleasure either in reading or omitting them  BUT before I proceed any farther it will be necessary to obviate an objection that will infallibly occur to the reader's mind which is that in mentioning the first inventors of printing in the two preceding chapters I have not so much as nam'd  John Guttenbergh  whereas the greatest part of the authors whom we are about to quote place him in the first rank and mention only the other two as coadjutors to him In answer to this it will be sufficient for the present to say that the sequel of this History will shew that  Guttenbergh  had no other share in this invention than by furnishing the other two with necessary supplies to defray the great charges of it and that the authors of the  Mentz  and  Cologn  Chronicle whom the rest seem to have follow'd in this as also the learned antiquary  Trithemius  have certainly confounded  Guttenbergh  with  Faust  that is mistook the one for the other as will hereafter appear in its proper place  OF all the authors to whom the world is indebted for a particular account of this Discovery Abbot  Trithemius  justly claims the preeminence both upon the account of his living nearest the time of this discovery which he tells us happen'd in his younger years  Tempore infantiae meae apud  Moguntiam  c  Trith Epist Fam Epist    as well as for his care to derive his intelligence from its origin We have two noble testimonies out of his Chronicle the one from the first part intitled  Chronicon Spanheimense  where  His quoque temporibus ars imprimendi characterizandi libros de novo reperta est in civitate  Moguntina  per quendam civem qui  Johannes Guttenberg  dicebatur qui cum omnem substantiam propter nimiam difficultatem inventionis novae in eam perficiendam exposuisset consilio auxilio bonorum virorum  Johannis Fust  aliorum adjutus rem inceptam perfecit Primus autem hujus artis dilator fuit post

illius novae artis nomine noscitur insignita  Chronic Spanheim  ad ann  speaking of the year he says  "That about this time the Art of Printing and Casting Single Types was found out  anew  in the city of  Mentz  by one  John Guttenberg  who having spent his whole estate in this difficult discovery by the assistance and advice of some honest men  John Faust  and others brought his undertaking at length to perfection that the first Improver of this Art after the Inventor was  Peter Schoeffer  in Latin  Opilio de Gernsheim  who afterwards printed a great many volumes that the said  Guttenberg  liv'd at  Mentz  in a house call'd then  Zumjunghen  but afterward known by the name of the  Printing House  "  But lest the reader should be  startled at the word  anew de novo  it will be requisite to acquaint him that  Trithemius  was in all probability of the same opinion with some other writers who from a passage of St  Cyprian  misunderstood wherein the invention of Printing by which is meant no more than that of stamping of Letters and Hieroglyphicks upon Medals Coins c is attributed to  Saturn  took occasion to reckon it among the  artes perditae  and consequently esteem'd this rather a revival of the art than a new discovery but he sufficiently retracts that error in the next passage we shall quote from him which was not wrote till many years after and that from a more diligent enquiry into the discovery and merit of this new and  till then unheard of Art  for this will appear from his words as you will see immediately  THIS next passage which is fuller and for its singularity and decisiveness deserves to be set down at length is taken out of the second part of  Trithemius  's Chronicle intitled  Chronicon Hirsaugiense  This book was unknown to the learned till the year when the  Benedictins  of the monastery of St  Gall  in  Switzerland  beg'd leave to publish it from the original manuscript which had lain hid all that time The Abbot wrote this towards the close of his life after he had been inform'd of many particulars relating to this invention from the mouth of  Peter Schoeffer  in  English Shepherd  sirnam'd  de Gernsheim  to whom  Faust  for the many helps he had receiv'd from him namely in devising Punches Matrices and Moulds for casting their Metal Types in which the main perfection of the Art consisted gave his only daughter  Christina  in marriage and from a servant took him into partnership with him as appears by the inscriptions to the first books publish'd by them of which we have given a sketch already The passage is as follows  His temporibus in civitate  Moguntina Germaniae  prope  Rhenum  non in  Italia  ut quidam falso scripserant inventa excogitata est ars illa mirabilis prius inaudita imprimendi characterizandi libros

this time  ann  in the city of  Mentz  in  Germany  upon the  Rhine  and not in  Italy  as some writers falsly affirm'd the wonderful and  till then unknown Art  of Printing Books by Metal Types  characterizandi  was invented and devis'd by  John Guttenberg  citizen of  Mentz  who having almost exhausted his whole estate in contriving of this new Method and labouring under such insuperable difficulties in one respect or other that he began to despair of and to throw up the whole design was at length assisted with the advice and purse of  John Faust  another citizen of  Mentz  and happily brought it to perfection Having therefore begun with cutting characters of the letters upon wooden planks in their right order and compleated their forms they printed the vocabulary intitled  Catholicon  but could make no farther use of those forms because there was no possibility of separating the letters which were engraven on the planks as we hinted before To this succeeded a more ingenious invention for they found out a way of stamping the shapes of every letter of the  Latin  Alphabet in what they call Matrices from which they afterwards cast their letters either in copper or tin hard enough to be printed upon which they first cut with their own hands It is certain this art met with no small difficulties from the beginning of its invention as I heard years ago from the mouth of  Peter Schoeffer de Gernsheim  citizen of  Mentz  and  Soninlaw to the first Inventor of the Art  For when they went about printing the Bible before they had work'd off the third quire it had cost them already above florins But the aforemention'd  Peter Schoeffer  then servant and afterwards  Soninlaw to the first Inventor  John Faust as we hinted before being a person of great ingenuity discover'd an easier method of casting letters and perfected the art as we now have it These three kept this manner of printing very secret for some time  until it was divulg'd by their servants without whose help it was impossible to manage the business who carry'd it first to  Strasburg  and by degrees all over  Europe  Thus much will suffice concerning the discovery of this wonderful art the first inventors of which were citizens of  Mentz  These three first discoverers of printing  viz John Guttenberg John Faust  and  Peter Schoeffer  his Soninlaw liv'd at  Mentz  in a house then call'd  Zumjunghen  but ever since known by the name of the  Printinghouse  "  FROM this authentick testimony I shall beg leave to make the following observations  viz  That when the author concluded his Chronicle  ann  two years before his death and above years after the discovery this invention was indisputably ascrib'd to  Mentz  he says indeed that some writers had attributed it to  Italy  but without any foundation and therefore he rejects this notion as absolutely false Yet  Junius  as has been already hinted first started a dispute in favour of  Harlem  almost years after the art became known and after him Dr  Mentel  began another in favour of  Strasburgh ann  both which shall be answer'd in their places  THE next observation is that tho' the passage quoted out of his first Chronicle seems to be taken if not copy'd out of that of  Mentz  which is likewise a very antient and authentick monument yet our author seems not to have been satisfy'd with it till he had it confirm'd by surer hands Other authors indeed have written concerning the origin of this art according to the best memoirs they could procure whether true or false but our author alone has been at the pains to fetch his information from the fountain head and deliver'd the particulars of it as he receiv'd 'em from the principal agent in the invention in the quotation from his second Chronicle so that his testimony were it the only one we could produce for  Mentz  ought still to be esteem'd unquestionable and decisive  ANOTHER particular worth our observation is that tho' he mentions two books as printed immediately upon the discovery  viz  the  Catholicon  and the  Bible  yet he sufficiently shews the difference between the methods of their impression the former being done upon wooden planks cut with a knife after the  Chinese  manner as our wooden cutts are done now whereas the  Bible  was printed with separate types which as we shew'd in  the preceding chapter is the only way that merits the name of  Printing  This seems plainly intimated by the words in the citation beforementioned  When they came to print the Bible and by the vast expence they had been at before they finish'd the third quire of it  from which it is evident that this sacred book was the first work of consequence which the authors of this art made choice of to signalize the firstfruits of their invention  THE last thing I would observe is that tho'  Trithemius  gives the precedency of this discovery to  John Guttenbergh  in the beginning of this passage yet within a few lines after he twice gives the title of  The first inventor of Printing  to  John Faust  which contradiction cannot be well reconcil'd otherwise than by supposing that he thro' inadvertency wrote the name of  John Guttenberg  instead of  John Faust  and this is far from being improbable since their christian names are the same and tho' he again puts  Guttenbergh  first when he speaks of the house in which they liv'd yet this might be done only out of respect to him either as being a knight according to the writers of that time or because he was the most opulent of the three and had contributed most to the charges of the invention  THIS must be allow'd unless we could suppose that the editor having compar'd the two passages together namely that out of the first and this out of the second Chronicle had corrected as he imagin'd the latter by the former upon a suspicion that the author writing the last almost years after he had receiv'd the account from  Schoeffer  might have mistaken one name for the other but to be certain of this it would be necessary to consult the original However what confirms me in my conjecture is that the author or his editor have committed a mistake and that  Guttenberg  had no other interest in the discovery than by assisting them with money to promote the design is the lawsuit which he commenc'd against  Faust  at  Mentz  about the money expended and the judgment of the court thereupon of which the learned  Salmuth  has given the following account in his appendix to  Pancirol  's commentaries  Eodem tempore  Moguntiae  commorebatur  Johannes Guttenbergius  honestis parentibus natus qui proxime  Fausti  aedibus habitabat Hic cum animadvertisset insignem hancartem Typographicam non solum omnium ore passim celebrari sed etiam admodum lucrosam esse familiaritatem cum  Fausto  contraxit quia opulentus erat pecuniam ei ad sumptus necessarios obtulit quod  Fausto  minime ingratum fuit quandoquidem comperiebat sumptus quos in artem faciebat quotidie crescere tunc opus chartae pergamenae imprimendum sub manibus habebat quapropter cum  Guttenbergio  convenit pactus est ut quicquid in illud opus impenderetur communi utriusque lucro vel damno cederet Quoniam vero  Faustus  plus insumpserat quam  Guttenbergius  necessitatem postulasse arbitrabatur hic dimidiam suam partem exsolvere detrectavit qua exre cum lis orta esset alter alterum  Moguntinae  in jus vocavit ubi partibus auditis pronunciatum fuit si  Johannes Faustus  interposito juramento affirmare posset omnem pecuniam quam mutuam sumpsisset in commune opus erogatam non autem in proprios usus conversam fuisse  Guttenbergium  ad solvendum obligatum esse Cui sententiae  Faustus  paruit sicut ex archetypo instrumenti quod etiamnum superest anno sexto novembris a  Johanne Ulrico Helmosperger  notario de ea re confectum fuit liquido demonstrari potest Unde evidenter apparet  Guttenbergium  nequaquam artis typographicae inventorem primum authorem esse sed aliquot annis postquam ea inventa fuisset a  Johanne Fausto  in consortium adscitum pecuniam ei suppeditasseCum igitur  Guttenbergius  ad sumptus resundendos damnatus fuisset ex eo simultates inter illum  Faustum  magis exarsissent ille autem interea artem vidisset didicisset siquidem inter tot operas quae ad illam excudendam requiruntur fieri non potuit ut ea diutius occultaretur quod etiam Deus proculdubio noluit  Moguntia Argentinam  se contulit quo aliquot ex operis secum attraxit Post illud dissidium alii quoque qui apud  Faustum  artem illam didicerant eum deseruerunt  Francesurtum  atque in alia loca se receperunt cum praesertim anno  Moguntia  capta pristina sua libertate privata fuisset quo factum est ut haec praeclara ars omnibus innotesceret publici juris fieret  App  ndic ad Commentar Paneirol ad titul    qui est de Typographia  and this may  be esteem'd another pregnant testimony for  Faust  since 'tis extracted from an original record of the lawsuit The narrative as related by our author is as follows  "ABOUT this time there liv'd at  Mentz  one  John Guttenbergh  born of honest parents who dwelt next door to  John Faust  he observing this famous art of Printing was not only cry'd up every where but also very gainful contracted a friendship with  Faust  and being exceeding rich offer'd to supply him with money to defray the charges of it which was gladly accepted by  Faust  who began to find the expence grow too fast upon him and wanted  vellum  to print a work then in hand Upon this he agrees and covenants with  Guttenbergh  that whatever sums were laid out in the work should turn to their common profit or loss But because  Faust  had dispos'd of more money then  Guttenbergh  imagin'd the business would require he refused to pay his moiety upon which a dissension arose between them and they summon'd each other before the judges at  Mentz  The parties being heard it was decreed that if  Faust  would make oath that all the money which he had borrow'd had been expended in carrying on the common business and that he had converted no part thereof to his own private uses  Guttenbergh  should be oblig'd to pay him  Faust  submitted to this decree as may evidently be prov'd from an original instrument still extant which was drawn  Nov    ann  by  Uldric Helmosperger  a notary publick pursuant to the said sentence Hence it manifestly follows that  Guttenbergh  was in no wise the inventor or first author of Printing but that he had been admitted by  Faust  into partnership with him some few years after the discovery of the art and had lent him money to prosecute the design  Guttenbergh  being cast and oblig'd to pay cost and charges and new quarrels arising daily between  Faust  and him and he having seen and learn'd the business as it was impossible that among so many hands requisite to the carrying on of the art it should continue longer a secret which probably God would not suffer it to be he  Guttenbergh  went off to  Strasburg  taking some of the workmen along with him After this breach others having learn'd the art from  Faust  left him and settled some at  Frankfort  and others elsewhere especially when the city of  Mentz  was taken  The city of  Mentz  formerly a very wealthy city of the Empire was taken thro' a strategem by the Archbishop  Adolph  in the night preceding St  S Simon  and  Jude  in the year and plunder'd and depriv'd of its freedom  ann  and depriv'd of all its former liberties whereby this excellent art became more publick and universally known"  Thus far  Salmuth  whose account is confirm'd by the author of the  Encomium Chalcographiae  Vid Malinkrot p    J Arnold Bergellanus  who wrote an elegy upon the dissension between those two persons in which he seems to favour  Guttenbergh  more than  Faust  and to have follow'd  Wimpheling  who out of love to his fellowcitizen for he represents  Guttenbergh  as born at  Strasburgh  and not to have remov'd to  Mentz  till he had almost perfected the art makes him the chief person in this discovery yet mentions both the lawsuit and the decree as well as the deed before mention'd but differs from  Salmuth  in affirming that the lawsuit was not yet ended when he wrote his book which might arise from  Guttenbergh  's hanging it upon the hooks and escaping to  Strasburgh  as  Salmuth  observes or to  Harlem  as others believe However this is evident and agreed on by all hands that there was an end at once to all their partnership into which he was only admitted for the sake of his purse which was absolutely necessary to  Faust  FROM all these testimonies which are not only quoted but strongly assented to by the judicious  Malincrot  Vid Malinkrot c  I shall make one or two remarks in favour of  Mentz  and  Faust  which are that among all the learned  I have convers'd with whose curiosity hath lead them to search into the rise and progress of Printing and all the writers upon this subject I could ever meet with not one has pretended to have seen any book printed in  John Guttenbergh  's name even in the oldest monuments remaining of the infancy of this art whether printed upon wood or by separate metal types That on the contrary where there is any mention made of either printer or place it is still in  Faust  's and  Schoeffer  's name  THEREFORE until there is some better proof of  Guttenbergh  's name either jointly with the other two or separately or some book produc'd with it it seems evident beyond contradiction that the glory of this invention is wholly due to  John Faust  and the improving and perfecting it to his soninlaw  Peter Schoeffer  exclusive of  John Guttenbergh  this I hope will suffice to justify my conjecture that either  Trithemius  mistook the names or the editor of his second chronicle chang'd them to make it agree with his first and to sa  sfy the reader that I had good reasons and authority to forbear mentioning  Guttenbergh  among the first inventors I shall only add with respect to the learned  Salmuth  that he prefaces this account with a succinct relation of the improvements which the ingenious  Peter Schoeffer  made to the art as the invention of Punches Matrices  c  as likewise of the difficulties which they met afresh by reason of the softness of the metal in which they had cast their first types and of his finding out a new mixture which fully answer'd the design lastly that  Faust  was so pleas'd with his servants ingenuity that he made him his soninlaw This passage which I have here subjoin'd  Caeterum in exercenda hac nova arte operis quibusdam usus est  Faustus  in quibus fuit  Petrus Schoeffer Gernsheimensis  qui cum heri sui institutum percepisset magno illius artis studio incensus est quia ingenio valebat ani mum ad illam amplificandam adjecit ac singulari Dei instinctu rationem inivit qua Characteres Matrici ut vocant inciderentur ex ea funderentur Alphabeto hoc modo inciso characteres inde fusos  Fausto  hero suo ostendit quibus ille usque adeo exhilaratus est ut ei protinus filiam suam unicam desponderet ac paulo post in uxorem daret quam vis autem in hoc genere Characterum aliqua difficultas suborta esset propterea quod materia mollior esset quam ut pressurae resistere posset tamen mox ejusmodi mixtura inventa fuit quae vim praeli aliquandiu sustinere potuit  Appen ad tit de Typogr p    is so exactly like that out of  Trithemius  's second Chronicle that one might easily be induc'd to think he had copy'd it from him were it not that this letter was neither printed or indeed known till almost a whole century  after  Salmuth  wrote as appears by  Camerarius  's letter prefix'd to his book and dated from  Nuremberg ann    THE learned  Wimpheling  claims the next rank as being contemporary with  Trithemius  and a no less diligent searcher after the memorable things of his own country He wrote his book  ann  or wherein is the following account  viz  "That in the year when  Ferdinand  was  Emperor  of the  Romans  that great and almost divine gift the discovery of a new way of writing was bestow'd upon mankind by  John Guttenbergh  who having first invented the art of Printing went afterwards to  Mentz  where he perfected it"  The rest of the passage which relates chiefly to the promulgation of the art and the Printers who enrich'd and signaliz'd themselves by it we shall refer to the second book to which it properly belongs  I have already remark'd something of  Wimpheling  's partiality to his own city  Strasburg  and indeed 'tis what the reader may observe in all authors whose country laid the least claim to this invention  Faust  for having carry'd on the business with all possible secresy and scarce being known out of his own city till the dispersion of his workmen they wherever they settled challeng'd to themselves the honour of this discovery or at least of being coadjutors to the inventor as we shall shew in its proper place However the reader will see with pleasure how our author retracts his too great liberality to his fellowcitizen in another work  viz  his catalogue of the Bishops of  Strasburg  wherein he expresses himself thus  "Under that Bishop  Robert  of  Bavaria  was the noble art of Printing found out by a certain  Strasburgher  tho' in an imperfect manner but upon his going to  Mentz  unto other practitioners of that art by the directions of one  John Gensfleich  an old gentleman blind with age the art was perfected in the house call'd  Guttenbergh  in English  Goodhill  where the College of Lawyers now stands to the eternal honour of the  German  nation"  THERE is no need to observe to the reader the difference between this passage and the former nor to inquire whether it was out of remorse or upon better information that the author gave this latter account but it will be proper to remark that  Gensfleich  is another name given by several writers to  Faust  or perhaps a nickname which he was known by it signifying gooseflesh so that our author has attributed to  him at least the glory of having practis'd the art at  Mentz  before  Guttenbergh  came and to have directed him in perfecting what he had in vain attempted at  Strasburg  The reader may likewise observe that  Guttenbergh  seems to have been thus denominated from the house so call'd in which  Faust  and he carried on the business till their mutual discords parted them  JOHN NAUCLERUS author of the universal history which is divided into generations  Histor Univer Gen  tells us that this art of Printing with metal types was discover'd at  Mentz  under the Emperor  Ferdinand  III  ann  and extols the genius of  Germany  as for other glorious inventions such as Guns c so more particularly for this of Printing which he makes a large encomium upon He liv'd near the times of this invention  viz ann  and tho' he mentions not the authors of it yet since he says it was discover'd at  Mentz ann  it is plain he could mean none but  Faust  seeing no books were printed there for many years after but by him and his soninlaw  NEITHER have the poets of those times been wanting in celebrating this invention from which alone they and their works could expect that immortality which they confer upon the  Great  and  Good  We have quoted some of them in the preceding chapter as  Laurentius Valla  an  Italian  and  Sebastian Brand  a  German  tho' this last being a native of  Strasburgh  and afterwards Mayor of that city we will not pretend to determine whether what he sings of the  Rhenish  nation and the  German  genius be meant of  Mentz  or his own city however 'tis evident that he never dreamt of  Holland  or  Harlem  But let us now hear  Conrad Celt  the first  German  PoetLaureat who speaking of the river  Rhine  has the following Tetrastich upon the city of  Mentz  Amor lib Eleg    Jamque  Mogunciacam  vastus te flectis in urbem  Quae prima impressas tradidit aere notas  Qualem ego te memorem talem qui invenerit artem  Italicis Graiis  plus memorande viris  IN another elegy he expresses his desire of visiting that famous city which had taught the  Germans  this excellent method of writing without  Ibid Eleg  pen c I hope to be excus'd the pains of a larger collection of this nature the reader may find plenty of such poetical encomiums upon this art in  Malinkrot  's history chap and elsewhere But I cannot omit inserting a short passage out of the famous  Swedish  poet  Nicodemus Frischlin  who in his  Julius Redivivus  a comedy in praise of  Germany  and the Art of Printing has these lines  primus Inventor Typographiae  Moguntiae  Vixit fatale nomen adeptus  Fausti    soon after which he gives an elegant description of the wonderful change produc'd by this art which render'd the  Germans  before a rude and illiterate people able to teach the most polite nations of  Europe  by its admirable quickness in multiplying of books which is elegantly express'd by  Campanus  bishop of  Aleria  in this verse  Imprimit illa die quantum non scribitur anno  To return to the historians of later date  Peter Apian  who for his incomparable skill in mathematicks had the honour to be tutor to the Emperor  Charles  V assures us  Cosmograph lib    that  Mentz  a frontier town between high and low  Germany  was the place where Printing was discover'd by  John Faust ann    Sebastian Munster  another Cosmographer gives a larger account of this invention  Ab anno usque ad ann nobilis ars imprimendi  Moguntiae  reperta est ca  Moguntia Coloniam  deinde  Argentinam    Basileam  tandem  Venetias  delata est Primus ejus author inventor  Johannes Gutte bergius  qui  Zunjungen  dicebatur isque cives alios duos  Moguntinos  adjutores habuit  Johannem Faustum Johannem Medimbachium  qui artem hanc in secreto tenuerunt famulis de ea non propalanda jurejurando constrictis  Munster Cosmograph lib    c    apud Malinkrot c    p    tho' he seems to follow  Trithemius  and those who place  Guttenbergh  at the head of the triumvirate his words are these  "From the year to the year the noble Art of Printing was discover'd at  Mentz  thence it was carry'd to  Cologn  then to  Strasburgh Basil  and at last to  Venice  Its first author and inventor was  John Guttenbergh  otherwise call'd  Zumjungen  who had two other citizens for assistants  viz John Faust  and  John Medimbach  who kept this art very secret having sworn their servants not to divulge it"  Mutius  who wrote his  German  Chronicle  ann  attributes the invention of Guns and soon after that of Printing to  Mentz  But the most illustrious testimony in favour of  Faust  is that of the great collector of  German  antiquities  John Aventine  to this purpose  Hoc anno magnum ac vere divinum beneficium  Johannes Faustus

fortunes and excited men to the study of arts and sciences by the plenty of learned works which it hath afforded us This divine invention was kept private by  John Faust  and  Peter Schoeffer de Gernsheim  to whom he had given his only daughter  Christina  in marriage and all their workmen were bound by an oath not to disclose it Ten years after this  John Guttenbergh  of  Strasburgh  one of  Faust  's servants divulg'd it in  Germany Ulric Han  a fellowcitizen of his and  Xyxtus Resius  brought it to  Rome  and  Italy  where within my memory  Aldus Manutius  a person design'd for the restoration of learning signaliz'd himself c"  The remainder of this passage chiefly relates to the dispersion and promulgation of the art and therefore is unnecessary to be set down here There is but one thing in this quotation that can puzzle the reader which is that the author makes  Guttenbergh  to have been one of  Faust  's servants instead of his partner and usurer as has been shewed already in the rest he exactly agrees with the writers quoted before With respect to the disagreement among authors concerning the names of the first inventors if we remember that  Guttenbergh  to evade the sentence pronounc'd against him at  Mentz  departed with some of  Faust  's workmen to  Strasburgh  it will not appear improbable that some who wrote at a distance might confound him with those servants especially considering that his name was never in any Book printed at  Mentz  However 'tis plain that a place of one writer mistaken by another has been the occasion of leading many more who have follow'd him implicitely into the same error An instance of this which will be no digression from our history is as follows  THE authors who have follow'd  Peter Ramus  from  Sabellicus Zuringer  c down to  Paul Pater  author of the treatise  De Germaniae Miraculo  the Art of Printing publish'd  ann  have ascrib'd this invention to  J Regiomontanus  and thought they did the Art no small honour in making so great a Mathematician its author What seem'd to confirm their opinion was that  Faust Guttenbergh  and he were contemporaries and 'tis probable liv'd near each other tho' he afterwards remov'd to  Nurembergh  What made this still more probable was that  Regiomontanus  perfectly understood Mechanicks so that as it is said he made an iron Flyspring from under his hand fly round the room with a humming noise and return back under his hand he is likewise reported to have made a wooden Eagle which flew from  Nurembergh  to meet the Emperor hover'd over his head in a tonick motion and went back the same way with him It would be dangerous now to assert the truth of these stories since such flights of ingenuity have been so long discourag'd to make way for more useful inventions yet  Jul Scaliger  was so far from doubting of them that he pretends to have found out the Art and bragg'd that he could perform the like with a wet finger However this was sufficient to persuade our authors that  Regiomontanus  reputed so universal an artist was most probably the person who invented  the method of Printing and communicated it to  Faust  and  Guttenbergh  in consequence of which they have plac'd him at the head of the other two Nevertheless this notion seems to take its rise from a passage in  Purbach  's tables wherein 'tis said that the discovery of Printing is to be refer'd to the times of  Regiomontanus  as  Malinkrot  has fully prov'd This story I hope will both convince the reader of the danger of following an author too implicitely and justify my differin from the generality of those who attribute the discovery to  John Guttenbergh  whose opinion I apprehend to be sufficiently confuted Setting aside this mistake of  P Ramus  with respect to  Regiomontanus  he agrees with the rest of our other testimonies in favour of  Faust  and I conceive it to be not in the least improbable that the inventors might in such a variety of tools implements and other things necessary to the perfecting this Art have recourse to him or some other ingenious person for advice and assistance  HOWEVER it is certain that  Regiomontanus  was a very early printer tho' not taken notice of as such by any writer I have met with I did indeed believe him to have been an assistant in perfecting of the Art but never could meet with any sufficient authority to fix the honour upon him till I was admitted into the Library of the Right Hon the Earl of  Pembroke  whom I beg leave to take this first opportunity of mentioning with honour and gratitude not only for his great condescension in allowing me a free access to his noble Collections of antient Editions but likewise for several very curious hints upon this subject which shall be mention'd in their proper places here it was that his Lordship was pleas'd to shew me the following great curiosity viz  Manilius  in to with these words at the end  Ex Ossicina  Johannis de Regiomente  in Nuremberg  THE antiquity of this curious Edition shews it self at first sight tho' there be no date to it a circumstance much to be lamented tho' too common to many of those antient monuments in the infancy of the Art I must therefore be oblig'd to rank it with the rest of these dateless works of which I shall have occasion to speak in the sequel of this history it is evident this is an older edition than that mention'd by  Fabricius  of  which 'tis reasonable to suppose not only by his being contemporary with but assistant to  Faust  in perfecting this art however as  Regiomontanus  was a man of such profound skill in astronomy mechanicks and several other branches of learning I am willing to hope time will bring forth some further testimonies concerning him  BUT what convinces me that he had no share in the first discovery of the Art is that in his long dedication prefix'd to his  Astronomical Tables  the first piece he ever publish'd which I have seen and which is dedicated to the Primate of  Hungary  he doth not make the least mention of his having been concern'd in such a noble discovery which it is reasonable to suppose he would have done could he have claim'd such a singular piece of merit to have recommended him to so great a patron especially when he expatiates so much upon the difficulties that attended the work he dedicates to him but to return  I apprehend a probable objection against the testimonies before quoted which are scarce a fourth part of those collected by  Malinkrot  that they are taken from  Germans  who may be reasonably suppos'd too partial to their country and consequently less to be relied on than foreign writers whose authority would be of far greater weight in this case This I shall obviate by shewing that learned authors of other nations are consistent with the  Germans  in this particular I have already cited two poets the one an  Italian  the other a  Swede  the former of whom ascribes this discovery to  Germany  and the latter to  John Faust  of  Mentz  My next design is to produce some of those who are eminent for their enquiries into the antiquities of their own and other countries At the head of these stands  Polydore Vergil  an  Italian  who in his Book  de Rerum Inventoribus  after an elegant encomium upon the Art and a description of its important benefits to mankind proceeds thus  "Wherefore that the author of such a discovery may not be depriv'd of his due praise and that posterity may know to whom we are indebted  Quare tantae rei author non est sua laude fraudandus praesertim ut posteritas sciat cui divinum acceptum beneficium referre debeat Itaque  Johannes Guttenbergius  natione  Teutonicus  equestri vir dignitate ut ab ejus civibus accepimus primus omnium in oppido  Germaniae  quam  Moguntiam  vocant

Decimo sexto deinde anno qui suit salutis humanae M CCCC L VIII quidam nomine  Conradus  homo itidem  Germanus  primum in  Italiam  attulit c  lib    cap    for this divine gift it was  John Guttenbergh  by nation a  German  and a Knight who first devis'd this Art of Printing Books in the city of  Mentz  and began to practise it there as we have been inform'd by the citizens themselves he is reported likewise to have made another discovery  viz  of a new kind of Ink us'd now by all printers Sixteen years after this  ann  one  Conrad  a  German  brought it first to  Rome  c"  Our author makes no mention of any but  Guttenbergh  yet as he says the Art was first practis'd at  Mentz  'tis plain from what has been said before that he deserv'd not the first name in this invention The citizens who gave this account were certainly those that dispers'd themselves from  Faust  who though they learn'd the Art of him yet might esteem  Guttenbergh  the first author because he was most considerable and not unlikely lorded it over the rest who he knew could not carry on the business without his purse whilst  Faust  whose chief care was to conceal the Art till he had reimburs'd himself so far as to be able to carry it on without his help might let him enjoy the honour of the discovery in the mean time What confirms my conjecture is that if  Conrad  arriv'd at  Rome  in the year he must have left  Mentz  before  Faust  and  Schoeffer  had printed any Books with their names However in this case  Faust  would not be the only man whose indigence and honesty have been inducements to part with the credit of a beneficial discovery to a person of less merit rather than to let it die with him for want of means to carry it on  THE following author  Jacobus Philippus Bergomensis  Jacob Philip Bergomens lib    supplem Chronic ad ann  Ars imprimendi libros his temporibus in  Germania  primum enata est quam alii repertam esse asseverant a  Cuthimbergio Argentino  alii a quodum alio nomine  Fausto  alii a  Nicolao Genson  praedicant pro qua innumerabiles authores ipsi congregarunt divitias c  who is doubtful concerning the genuine inventor may easily be set right from what has been already said He tells us  "that the Art of Printing was first brought to light in  Germany  about the year that the discovery was by some attributed to  Guttenbergh  of  Strasburgh  by others to one  Faust  and by a third sort to  Nicholas Genson  or  Jenson  that the authors of it got immense riches c"  With relation to this  Jenson  it will appear by the sequel of this history that he was only one of those who first carry'd the Art into  Italy  where he distinguish'd himself  by his fine impressions c but never made the least pretences to the invention There is no necessity of repeating what has so often been said concerning  Guttenbergh  whom  Palmerius  of  Pisa  asserts to have been the author of this discovery about the year his words are as follow  "  Quantum literarum studiosi  Germanis  de beant nullo satis dicendi genere exprimi potest namque a  Johanne Guttenberg Zumjunghen  equite  Moguntiae Rheni  solerti ingenio librorum imprimendorum ratio anno inventa hoc tempore in omnes fere orbis partes propagatur qua omnis antiquitas parvo aere comparata posterioribus infinitis voluminibus legitur  Chronic ad ann    What obligations the learned world hath to the  German  nation cannot be sufficiently express'd for the Art of Printing which had been invented by  John Guttenbergh Zumjungen  a knight of  Mentz  upon the  Rhine  about the year is at this time  viz ann  divulg'd almost throughout the world by which the works of the antients may be purchas'd at a small price and be read in an infinite number of volumes since printed"  There are a prodigious many more authors who tho' they do not mention either the names of the inventors or the place of the discovery yet unanimously give the honour of it to  Germany  and even  Paulus Jovius  who ascribes the invention of wooden planks to the  Chinese  from whom it was brought into  Europe  by the way of  Scythia  and  Muscovy  when he speaks of the other method of Printing says it is no wonder that several arts and sciences owe their birth to the  Germans  since the noble discovery of metal types as well as that of brass cannons was found out by them  Lib histor    MY next testimony is that of the celebrated politician  John Ruterus  who not only in his historical relations attributes the invention of Guns and Printing to the  German  nation but confirms it more fully in his book  de fortuna illustrium virorum  c where he says  "That he will not contend about the author of Printing but gratefully acknowledge the singular gift of God in it seeing one man can print as much in one day as the best hand can write in a whole year for there is scarce continues he a Press especially in the  German  Printing    Ruterus  's his words as I find them translated by  Gaspard Eusius  in  Malinkrot  p are these  "De Authore artis impressoriae hie non digladiabor summum id Dei beneficium grato animo nos sedulo decet agnoscere ab uno enim homine uno die tantum literarum imprimitur quantum vix toto anno scribi posset singulis enim diebus in quolibet prelo in  Germanorum  typographiis ter mille sexcentae chartae nonnunquam etiam quater mille interdum ultra c"  houses which doth not print off sheets  per diem  nay some and others exceed even that number"  I shall conclude this chapter with a passage out of the great Monsieur  Thevet  cosmographer to the king of  France  not only because his authority will easily outbalance that of all the  Dutch  writers but likewise because there are some particulars in it which will be acceptable to the reader As it is something prolix I shall only extract the most remarkable part as follows  Thevet  's Lives and Pictures of Illustrious Persons  ch    "This art of Printing is believ'd to have been first invented at  Mentz  in  Germany  about the year by  John Guttenbergh  a  German  knight who began his first essays of it there and found out a new sort of ink now us'd by the Printers but there are some writers of opinion that this honour rather belong'd to  John Faust  and  Ives  in latin  Ivo Schoeffer  two years before that time and affirm that  Guttenbergh John Mentel  and others whose names our author quotes out of  Pantaleon  all  Germans  improv'd afterwards the art and divulg'd it in several parts of  Germany  and at length carry'd it to foreign nations Others write that this art came originally from  China  and  Cathai  but this assertion is without any foundation seeing the  EastIndies  were not discover'd by the  Portugese  till about years ago whereas Printing has been invented and practis'd ever since  Paul  the  Venetianindeed  gave the first description of that country about years ago but made not the least mention of Printing being us'd there A confirmation of my opinion is that the  Greeks Mingrelians Abyssines Turks Persians Moors Arabs  and  Tartars  write all their books by hand this method was ordain'd in  Turky  by an edict of  Bajazet  II who prohibited the use of printed books under pain of death  ann  which edict was confirm'd by  Selim  I  Bajazet  's son  ann▪  Besides this whilst I was in  Egypt  I saw several books so neatly written on the bark of palmtrees that they might be taken for printed ones The merchants which bring their wares from  India  through the  Redsea  make use of the same sort of written books some of which are now to be seen at the library of the Queen dowager at St  German  's in the fields near  Paris  Others pretend that this art of Printing has been carry'd as far as  Mexico  which kingdom is directly  opposite to  Cathai  the one being in  Asia  towards the south and the other in  America  towards the northpole However it must be own'd that the  Americans  write with characters representing several kinds of beasts fish fowl the different parts of human bodies and the like by which they express their mind as the  Egyptians  did formerlyI have two of those books by me with an interpretation of their hieroglyphicks The goddess  Minerva  is said to have been the inventress of learning and war and the  Germans  have imitated her in both these respects by the invention of bombs and printing which were certainly discover'd by them One fault however that nation labours under which somewhat eclipses their glory which is that they know not how or at least neglect to improve those inventions that were so easily found out by them"  The author proceeds in an encomium upon the art and those who rais'd it to greater perfection but that belongs to another chapter  I hope that the testimonies produc'd hitherto will be more than sufficient to fix the palm upon  Faust  and the city of  Mentz  and that the reader will follow me with pleasure to the next chapter where they will be confirm'd by incontestable matters of fact  CHAP IV Authentick Facts in favour of  Faust  and  Mentz    IF the testimonies alledg'd in the preceding chapter are insufficient to convince any person that this invention is due to  Faust  what follows in this will I conceive put it quite out of doubt unless he be more incredulous in this case than a  Dutchman  for the great  Erasmus  has not only own'd himself convinc'd of this truth by one single fact but even transmitted it to posterity I shall therefore begin with that noble testimony which is a privilege granted by the Emperor  Maximilian  to  John Schoeffer  grandson of  John Faust  not only for the sole printing the works of  T Livy  at the end of which the privilege is annex'd printed by the said  John Schoeffer  at  Mentz ann  but likewise prohibiting all persons to reprint either the said book or any other which should be afterwards  printed by him in consideration of his being grandson to the first Inventor of the art of Printing concerning whom  Erasmus  who first publish'd that work speaks in his preface to it as follows  "If those who furnish'd  Origen  and St  Jerom  with writers and parchments have merited the highest commendation what praise is due to Printers and Booksellers who supply us with whole volumes for a small price If  Ptolemy Philadelphus  acquir'd such reputation for collecting so great a library what recompence can be made to those who furnish us daily with books in all languages But amongst all these to whom we are so much oblig'd we must gratefully remember the first inventor of this divine secret  John Faust  grand father to  John Schoeffer  "  Thus far  Erasmus  without the least mention of his countryman  Coster  With respect to the Emperor's priviledge it could not be suspected of any partiality to  Faust  rather than to  Guttenbergh  or to  Mentz  rather than  Strasburg  c since they were equally under his dominion  THE next fact to be related is that of the tools old types  c  of the inventors preserv'd in  Mentz  above years at least after the sacking of that city  ann  and view'd before that time by some eminent persons as curious relicks of the art among others  John Arnold Bengellanus  Hodie vetustissima quaedam in eum imprimendi sc usum ab authoribus comparata quae vidi instrumenta extant Moguntiae  Bergellan in praesat Encom su  Typograph  assures us that he had seen them there and  Nic Serrarius  adjiciantur primi denique artis hujus modioli quos antiqua hic  Moguntiae enim scribebat  domus in  Cesariae  horti platea custodit quosque mihi insuper  Albinus  typographus monstrabat  Nichol Serrarius de Rebus Moguntin l    c    says they were then kept at  Mentz  in a house in the street call'd  Keyser  's  garden  and shewn to him by one  Albinus  a Printer We need not bring a greater number of authors to attest this seeing it may likely be esteem'd but a weak proof by some of our readers but if they will consider what noise  Junius  and  Scriverius  have made about some trifles compar'd to these preserv'd at  Harlem  in memory of  Coster  according to a tradition of two or three old gentlemen they will not wonder that I lay some stress upon this and choose sometimes to make use of their own weapons against them I shall therefore subjoin another fact which is the inscription set up at  Mentz  by  Ives  of  Witigen  or  Venza  doctor of laws and professor in that university in the inner court of the college of lawyers  Johanni Guttenbergensi Moguntino  qui primus omnium literas  re imprimendas invenit hac arte de toto orbe bene merenti  Ivo Witigensis  hoc saxum pro monumento posuit  anno This inscription tho' it favours  Guttenbergh  more than  Faust  is more authentick than any of those three brought by  Junius  for  Coster  the last of which as  Malinkrot  observes is either written or at least publish'd by him the second is but a few years older and the first not plac'd over  Coster  's door 'till after  Junius  had publish'd his description of  Holland  A proof still stronger is the inscriptions found in the oldest books printed at  Mentz  wherein that city is styl'd the mother and inventress of printing If  Harlem  or any other city could have shewn a juster title to this honour it is surprizing that this place should have enjoy'd it for above years without the least contradiction and that no  Dutch  writer did so much as attempt in all that long interval to confute those known and remarkable  colophons  or inscriptions which  Faust  began to print at the end of his books when he could no longer conceal his discovery and in which he gives an account of the inventors and manner in which the books were done first negatively viz  not with pen and ink or any other writing instruments  and then affirmatively  but by a new art of casting types and printing  to which he adds the city of  Mentz  as the place where they were printed and concludes with the date of the month and year when they were finish'd We shall only subjoin some of the oldest and most remarkable of them for the present  I begin with that which is at the end of the  Codex Psalmorum  printed  an  and consequently the oldest book known to be printed with a date or inscription It is in the Emperor's library at  Vienna  and  Peter Lambec  who was library keeper gives this account of it  Reperi interea unum impressum in membrana in cujus fine de origine artis typographicae hoc legitur testimonium  "Praesens psalmorum codex venustate capitalium decoratus rubricationibusque sufficienter distinctus ac inventione artificiosa imprimendi ac characterisandi absque calami exaratione sic effigiatus ad eusebiam Dei industrie est consummatus per  Johannem Fust  eivem  Moguntinum    Petrum Schoeffer de Gernsheim  anno Domini Millessimo CCCCLVII in vigilia assumptionis"  Lib    Bibliothec Viadobon pag    that he met with one of them there printed on vellum at the end of which was this remarkable account of the origin of printing  viz This present Book of Psalms embellish'd with beautiful capitals and illuminated with all necessary  rubricks was thus form'd by an ingenious invention of printing by  separate Types  without pen or wrinting and finish'd with great care for the service of God by  John Faust  citizen of  Mentz  and  Peter Schoeffer de Gernsheim  in the year of our Lord  One Thousand CCCCL VII  on the eve of the assumption  i e Aug  THE next impression is the  Rationale Divinorum Officiorum  of  William Durand  printed at  Mentz  an in  fol Malinkrot  has it and tells us that it had been formerly bequeath'd to the monastery of  Galilea  near  Zutphen  a place afterwards destroy'd in the civil wars to be kept chain'd in the library and for which the donors were to be pray'd for together with their whole generation The inscription at the end of it being exactly the same with that of the Book of Psalms needs not be repeated here It is likewise mention'd by  Hoffman  in the second volume of his  Lexicon Universale  printed at  Basil  ann who says he saw it in the library of that university bearing date he calls it  Officiale Durandi  p and gives this inscription at the end  praesens hoc  c as before  THE next in date is the  Catholicon  a  latin  vocabulary the same which is affirm'd by  Trithemius  to have been printed in wood some time before and which was reprinted at  Mentz ann  I have seen two of these books one in the Earl of  Pembroke  's library and the other in the learned Dr  Mead  's with this very remarkable colophon at the end  Altissimi praesidio cujus nutu infantium linguae fiunt disertae quique nimio saepe parvulis revelat quod sapientes celat hic liber egregius  Catholicon  Dominicae incarnationis anno MCCCCLX alma in urbe  Moguntina  nationis inclytae  Germanica  quam Dei clementia tam alto ingenii lumine donoque gratuito caeteris nationibus praeferre illustrareque dignatus est non calami styli aut pennae suffragio sed

Catholice plaude Qui laudare piam semper non linque  Marium  Deo gratias  "By the assistance of the most high God at whose nod the tongues of infants become eloquent and who often reveals that to babes which he conceals from the wise this excellent book the  Catholicon  was finish'd in the year of our Lord's incarnation in the city of  Mentz  belonging to the noble  German  nation which God of his goodness has vouchsaf'd to prefer to other nations and of his free gift to make conspicious by this glorious invention this work was done not by the help of quil pencil or any writing instrument but  by the agreement symmetry and proportion of the printingpress"  then follows a doxology in four  latin  verses to this purpose  To thee Father Son and Holy Ghost three in one be honour and praise O Catholick reader give thanks for this book in the church and never cease to praise the blessed Virgin  Mary    Thanks be to God  THIS book tho' it mentions not the printers yet is easily known to have been done by  Faust  and  Schoeffer  from the likeness of the types and because at that time there were no other printers at  Mentz  or any where else  TWO years after this came out the great  Latin Bible  in  solio  which I also saw in Dr  Mead  's library which according to  Trithemius  and the  Cologn chronicle  must be the second edition of it the first having been printed soon after the year tho' without any colophon whereas this has the following  Praesens hoc opus finitum ac completum ad eusebiam Dei industrie in civitate  Moguntina  per  Johannem Fust  civem  Petrum Schoeffer  de  Gernsheim  clericum diocesis ejusdem▪ est consummatum anno incarnationis dominicae in vigilia assumptionis gloriosae virginis  Maria  "This present work was finish'd and compleated designedly for the service of God in the city of  Mentz  by  John Faust  citizen of it and  Peter Schoeffer de Gernsheim  clerk of the said diocess in the year of our Lord's incarnation on the vigil of the assumption of the glorious virgin  Mary  "  IT is unnecessary to remark that the word  Clerk Clericus  doth not here signify a clergyman for 'tis plain that  Schoeffer  was not so by his marrying  Faust  's daughter and leaving a son to succeed him but it was usual then to give that title to men of moderate literature Father  le Long  in his  Bibliotheca sacra  gives us the colophon of this Bible something different from ours tho' of the same date the reader may see it at full length in the ingenious Mr  Mattair  's Annals  page    not    CONCERNING this bible some writers give us the following account which is not a little in favour of  Faust  that it was so like handwriting and the titles and capitals so finely painted on vellum that  Faust  sold some of them at  Paris  for a prodigious price but the buyers finding a greater number upon him than it was possible for several men to transcribe  in their whole life and the pages of each copy so exactly alike that he was seiz'd try'd and condemn'd for  Magick  and  Sorcery  and was accordingly drag'd to the stake to be burnt but upon discovering his Art the parliament of  Paris  made an act to discharge him from all prosecution in consideration of his admirable invention However 'tis not a miss to inform the reader that his  Black Art  for which he was so roughly treated was printing his Bible on the  Black Letter  I shall in its proper place give my reasons for my opinion that the bible which  Faust  sold for MS was the first printed by him in the mean time this process against him and his discharge from it by order of that Parliament being matter of fact it was not foreign to our purpose to mention it here  THE last book which we shall speak of is  Tully  's  Offices  printed  ann  at the end of which are these words  Praesens  Marci Tullii  clarissimum opus  Johannes Fust Moguntinus  civis non atramento plumali canna neque aerea sed arte quadam perpulchra manu  Petri de Gernsheim  pueri mei feliciter effeci finitum  an  MCCCCLXV die IV  Februarii    John Faust  citizen of Mentz  happily perfected this famous Work of  Marcus Tullius  not with pen and ink  c  but by a  new beautiful Art  by the assistance of my Boy  Peter de Gernsheim Feb ann the edition at  Oxford  is dated tho' generally thought to be the same This inscription I saw in the book which that great Lover of the antiquities of the Art of Printing and Promoter of learning the Right Honourable the Earl of  Oxford  shew'd me the first time I had the honour to wait on his Lordship and to whose kind reception and information I stand greatly indebted  THE next inscriptions I shall mention are those in  Peter Schoeffer  's name alone in which there is a constant and remarkable strain of gratitude and respect for the city of  Mentz  from which besides other ample encouragements he had receiv'd his freedom as a reward for his improvements in the art As every one of them has an encomium upon that city I shall content my self with abridging some of the first and giving the last which has something singular in it at full length and conclude this head with a remarkable one us'd by his son  John Schoeffer  at the end of some of his books  IN the book call'd the  decisions of the Rota  printed  ann  and said to be still extant in the library of  Franckfort  he styles the city of  Mentz  the inventress and protectress of printing in some other books  viz Justinian  's  Institutions  printed  ann  and  c  he calls her the noble city which God has prefer'd to all others and signaliz'd with such superior gifts  c  the like is also to be seen at the end of  Harpianus  's  Speculum decem praeceptorum  printed  ann    THE last is at the end of St  Jerom  's  Epistles  in  Latin  printed in  folio  upon vellum  ann  one of which is in the library of St  Victor  and another at the College of  Sorbon  at  Paris  Vide  de la Caille  's  history of Printing  Paris pag  Jam decet ut nostris concordent

hath been with us to the conclusion  'Tis the churches honour to preserve so many writings of her champion  If you design them for any let it be for the churches honour  "THIS book therefore of  Sophronius Eusebius Jerom  and worthy its author a most eminent defender of the orthodox church of Christ or if you rather choose to call it with me the book of his epistles is finish'd that the honour of  Jerom  's name may be preserv'd which is owing to the excellent  John Andreas  who mov'd with a devout zeal towards that holy man formerly publish'd this work to the world This book was happily finish'd by the art of Printing by  Peter Schoeffer de Gernsheim  in the city of  Mentz  to the honour of which city the  blessed St  Jerom  writing to  Ageruntia  concerning monogamy or marrying but once has given this lasting testimony that many thousands of its inhabitants are honour'd in the church for having suffer'd martyrdom in defence of the catholick faith"  Mentz now returns him  Jerom  praise for praise  by publishing so many of his writings for the service of the church  in the year of our Lord    the seventh day of  September  which is the eve of the nativity of the Virgin  Mary  Give glory to God  THIS is an instance how ready  Schoeffer  was to take all opportunities of expressing his love and gratitude to that city and rendering her praise as lasting as his own works  THE last inscription which gives a succinct account of the discovery is at the end of  Trithemius  's breviary of history and is as follows  Impressum completum est praesens Chronicorum

Mindense  printed  anno  by the same person In both which the reader will be pleas'd to observe that there is not a word mention'd of  John Guttenbergh  UPON the whole 'tis my opinion that were there no other evidence but these inscriptions they would be sufficient to determine this controversy seeing neither  Harlem Strasburgh  nor any other place can produce any thing equivalent Had  Harlem  for instance any such authentick impressions in favour of  Coster  all other testimonies of the best writers for  Mentz  would have been rejected as inconsiderable or if Dr  Mentel  could have produc'd any single book printed by his progenitor of older or even equal date with the oldest of these he would infallibly have triumph'd over all his antagonists 'Tis certain that there is no book known to be printed at  Harlem  or any other place of equal date with the last which were done by  Faust  tho' it has been prov'd that he continu'd printing near ten years before he put his name to his impressions whence it follows that he was not only the first Printer with fusile metal types but likewise the first inventor of them according to the testimonies quoted in the preceding chapter  I doubt not but the reader is now willing to hear what methods the competitors with  Faust  take in order to evade such a cloud of authentick testimonies and what arguments they can allege in defence of their claim in short what grounds they have of triumphing in such an extraordinary manner But I must here acquaint him that if he expects evidence answerable to those clamours he will be extremely disappointed in the two next chapters However since a controversy cannot be fairly  decided unless both parties be heard in their turn I shall not desire the reader to believe me implicitly but propose their pretensions in as just a light and brief a manner as possible together with the answers of  Malinkrot  and others to them to which I shall take the liberty to add my own thoughts and observations whether they chance to illustrate and confirm or to contradict the concurrent testimony of the early and the establish'd notion of the modern writers upon the subject and leave it to him to judge of the merit of the cause  I hope what I said last will not be look'd upon as either a piece of presumption or ostentation in me no man can be more ready than I am to own the great helps I have receiv'd from these great men especially from  Malinkrot Chevalier Mattaire Orlandi  and some others of less note or my own insufficiency for such a work as this without such an assistance but tho' they are all great and learned men in their way yet for want of a sufficient acquaintance with the business of Printing it was impossible for them not to overlook some things of moment which a printer would easily discover at first sight  viz  Whether a book be MS or printed whether printed from pages of wood or with separate types in both which respects many of them have been either puzled or mistaken I shall add but one instance more not foreign to our purpose the famous Mons  Naudé  directed his readers how to know the books printed by  Faust  by the mark in the paper which he calls the  Heifer's Horns  Mr  Mattaire  who has been as curious and diligent as any one tells us he could never observe that mark or any thing like it whereas the very first book the Earl of  Pembroke  shew'd me of  Faust  's printing by holding a leaf against the light the mark appear'd very plain I shall beg leave to add that the hints and helps I have had from the curious and learned and my access to several noble libraries have moreover enabled me to make many more curious observations on this subject than I could otherwise have done Let this be said once for all  CHAP V The Pretensions of  Harlem  examin'd and confuted  I Have more than once hinted that this controversy in favour of  Harlem  was not started till above years after the discovery of the art when  Hadrian Junius  M D began the dispute During that long interval the invention was universally ascribed to the city of  Mentz  tho' the names of the inventors were sometimes confounded and what ought to surprise us most of all is that not one  Dutch  writer during that time ever offer'd to contradict the received opinion concerning  Faust  and  Mentz  tho' many of them were men of great learning and some either natives of  Harlem  or had been educated in that university 'Tis really wonderful that neither regard to truth or their country's honour nor the common ambition of being the author of a new discovery should have inspir'd some of them to undeceive the world in this point if they had the least grounds of suspicion But whatever be the reason of this unpardonable supineness in them Dr  Junius  rather than fall under such a charge undertook a task as difficult as that  Egyptian  one of making brick without straw For from a collection of old traditions wooden types and two or three books printed on wood without name date or any other mark by which it might be guess'd when where and by whom they were done with some other transmuted relicks of the first essays of the art he has form'd a story which he thinks will baffle all the testimonies urg'd on the other side and turn the panegyricks bestow'd by the learned on the noble inventor into the vilest calumnies As his story is very prolix and unnecessary to be set down at length the following abstract may suffice  "THO' the glory of this art is entirely due to the city of  Harlem  yet I am sensible how deep the contrary notion in favour of  Mentz  is rooted in the minds of menWere I blest with that eloquence which  Carneades  is so fam'd for who never affirm'd any thing but what he fully  prov'd nor oppos'd any error but what he clearly confuted I might have just hopes to reduce this stol'n glory to its owner and bring to light the truth which has so long lain hid in  Democritus  's wellFor if those antients who contended for the invention of letters in behalf of their favourite heroes have merited such applause what hinders but that I influenc'd neither by partiality to one place nor envy towards another but with a sincere love to truth should appear in so just a cause which has been suffer'd to sink for want of advocatesAnd if  Plutarch  esteems him the best evidence who is not byass'd by favour or affection I have a sufficient claim to it since none of  Coster  's posterity can reward me for my performance I shall therefore relate what has been told me by some grave and worthy old  Gentlemen  who have fill'd the best offices in the city and heard it from others of equal weight and authority  viz  That about years ago there liv'd at a noted house standing to this day over against the Royal Palace one  Laurence John  sirnam'd  Coster  which word signifies a sexton or churchwarden or in the  Romish  sense one who is intrusted with all the rich plate sumptuous robes  c  belonging to the parish church a place hereditary in his family who was the person to whom the Art of Printing owes its original tho' he has been unjustly depriv'd of that honourThat walking by chance in an adjacent wood according to custom after a full meal or on holydays he cut some letters out of the bark of beechtrees which being inverted and joyn'd together he began to print some words and then whole lines in hopes that this might turn to the advantage of his grandchildren that the success of this prompted him to greater discoveries he being a man of an extraordinary genius that he with  Thomas Peter  his soninlaw finding the common ink apt to spread invented a more glutinous sort and began to print whole pages of which kind I saw some essays in an anonymous work printed only on one side and entitled the  Mirour of our Salvation  written in  Low Dutch  the white sides of the paper being glew'd together to hide the chasms that after this he chang'd his wooden letters into lead and then into tin which was still harder and more durable some of these old types being cast into drinkingcups are still  to be seen at the aforesaid house out of which  Gerard Thomas Coster  's greatgrandson dy'd a few years ago But as all new inventions meet with encouragement this art began to require a greater number of hands which prov'd the first cause of mischief to this family for one of his servants nam'd  John  but whether  Faust  or not I shall not now enquire being employ'd in this business after having taken an oath of secrecy had no sooner learn'd as he thought the method of casting and joining the fusile types  c  but he took the next opportunity of robbing his master of all his printingtools together with his art to which end he chose the night before  Christmass  as the most proper for his design when the whole family with the rest of the city were at church at midnightmass Thence he escap'd to  Amsterdam  next to  Cologn  and at last settled at  Mentz  where the year following  viz ann  he printed  Alexandri Galli doctrinale  a grammar much in vogue at that time with those very types that his master  Coster  had us'd before  THIS is the substance of what I had from those gentlemen of veracity who told me they had it handed down by tradition and this has been likewise confirm'd to me by others of equal repute I remember to have heard my tutor  Nich Gallius  an old gentleman of a very tenacious memory say that when he was a boy he heard one  Cornelius  a printer an old man who had been one of  Coster  's workmen mention the story of the first trials of printing with a great deal of vehemence and even with tears especially when he came to the thievish part of it protesting he could execute the rogue himself with the utmost pleasure if he had been alive then cursing those nights in which for near three months together he had lain with so vile a miscreant A story like this one  Quirinus Talesius  reports that he had heard from the same Printer  THIS is what my sincere love of truth oblig'd me to publish whatever the consequence bebut I am fearful that prejudice in this case will outbalance reason and authority The passing of this invention into  Germany  in a lawful way had been no harm nay I believe that it pleased God to make it the means of perfecting and divulging so useful an art  c  "  HERE is all that our author could collect in defence of his cause which he had made the best of after his way it were indeed to be wish'd the Doctor had rather imitated the modesty of  Carneades  than wish'd for his eloquence since that great philosopher however he seems to forget it never was known to affirm any thing Convinc'd as he was of the weakness of human understanding and of the power of prejudice he always contented himself with confuting the opinions of others without ever shewing that he held any of his own but such an excellent talent would have spoil'd his design and condemn'd both his book and his old men's fables to obscurity and oblivion and saved some other authors the trouble of writing in the vindication of either but tho' he has been follow'd by about a dozen of his countrymen yet no additional testimonies are to be expected from any of them for even  Boxhorn  who wrote with the greatest vehemence and spleen against  Malinkrot  has been oblig'd to content himself with palliating the account of  Junius  and endeavouring to shew that it is not quite so improbable as his antagonist hath represented it However it must be owned that except the two last nam'd authors and one or two more  viz Berchius  and  Scriverius  the first of whom has been confuted by  Nicholas Serrarius  a Jesuit in his book  de rebus Moguntinis lib    Cap  and and the later by the learned Mons  Naudé George Draude  and others I say except these all the rest write more moderately without invectives or ill language and some of them even with doubt whilst others modestly contend only for the invention of printing on woodenplanks leaving that of metal types to  Faust  but even this is inconsistent with the story of  Junius  who asserts  Coster  to be the inventor of them both and  Faust  the thief It would be superfluous to multiply quotations out of the writers on the side of  Harlem  since they follow  Junius  upon his bare testimony and a confutation of him will easily dispatch all the rest I shall therefore examine the probability of his account and see how far it outweighs the testimonies and authorities alleg'd on the other side in the execution of this the best method will be to follow the steps of the learned  Malinkrot  who has sufficiently expos'd the numerous absurdities which this story is attended with Setting aside therefore the oddness of  Coster  's fancy in chusing to make his first letters of the bark of beech  which will bend whilst green and break when dry whilst the wood itself would have been much more proper to bear the weight of the press and the improbability of his changing them into metal ones which is barely asserted by  Junius  and contradicted by  Berkius Boxhorn  and other  Dutch  writers as we hinted before nothing can be more ridiculous than the converting those types into drinking cups to perpetuate the memory of their discovery they had certainly been more authentick in their former state at least if some notable work or inscription had been printed with them or would it not have been a better method to celebrate the name of the inventor to have distributed annually a portion of wine out of them in order to inspire their poets with songs in his honour and  Faust  's shame or to have hang'd them up as trophies in the townhall or great church  c  with respect to the stolen types which were turn'd to a better purpose by the thief who the next year printed with them  Alexandri doctrinale  and the works of  Petrus Hispanus  if  Junius  may be credited who was the first that said or thought of this well might  Serrarius  say after the Emperor  Julian Who will be found innocent if one accusation makes a man guilty  One would naturally think that this story was devis'd in the woods and walks about  Harlem  for several of the writers before mention'd and particularly the  Colognian Chronicle  alleg'd by  Boxhorn  agree that the  Latin  bible was the first book printed by  Faust  at  Mon    'Tis surprizing that these gentlemen of  Harlem  should pretend to tell us what was done with their types in the very heart of  Germany  and yet be entirely ignorant of what was done in their own city besides at that time it is certain as we have already shewn that separate types of any sort of metal were unknownBut to proceed this treacherous servant it seems went off at aclock at night when the whole family was at churchIt is highly improbable that a  Dutchman  should leave his shop so open and expos'd at that time of night when it was fill'd with all the tools and apparatus of an invention so important and known only to himself and his man for it is downright absurdity to think that he might depend on the oath with which he had engaged the latter to secrecy Such a night as that wherein the inhabitants of the city were going to or coming from mass was by no means proper for such a design and supposing he might have pass'd undisturb'd with his stollen  treasure yet he could not with the same facility pass thro' the gates or leap over the walls with at least a thousand weight of letters on his back or if his booty was those wooden planks with which the two large books mention'd before were printed as some of the  Dutch  writers seem to hint against  Junius  it was sufficient to load two or three carts that he should go with them to  Amsterdam  then to  Cologn  and at last to  Mentz  without being taken notice of is no less astonishing I shall not insist upon his rashness in chusing to go thro' such publick roads and noted cities and thereby running the danger of being seized the consequence of which would have been capital punishment nor upon the unaccountable supineness of his master in not pursuing nor causing him to be apprehended when he open'd shop at  Mentz  where he could easily have reach'd him nor yet upon the probability that the publick must have been obliged by this daring attempt of robbing the country of such a glorious discovery to prosecute the robber with the utmost severity where ever he could be found  IN the next place should we grant that  Faust  or some other servants had stollen the types does it necessarily follow that he carry'd away the art with them Could neither  Coster  nor his soninlaw and assistant  Tho Peter  nor any of his grandchildren recover a new press cast new types and publish something that might expose the thief and shew to whom the world was indebted for this invention Besides it appears from  Junius  that some of the types were left behind which were afterwards transformed into drinkingvessels if these were not sufficient to set them to work again the interval of ten years  viz  from the pretended robbery  anno  to the divulging of the art  anno  was more than enough to have compleated a new set seeing the first inventors devis'd try'd and perfected this method in less time But 'tis urg'd that  Coster  dy'd either of grief or otherwise before he had brought the art to any perfection so that  Harlem  was anticipated by  Mentz  This is affirmed by  Majolus  and  Quadi  tho' without grounds for  Junius  tells us that he invented the separate metal types as well as woodenblocks and met with such encouragement that people came far and near to purchase his books tho' at very dear rates now if he was alive as  he  and  Berkius  relate  anno  six years after this pretended flight during that interval  he might have renew'd his works there being no want of buyers and inscrib'd his books after this or some such manner  This work was done at  Harlem  by  L J Coster  the inventor of this art of printing  c  and not by that notorious pretender  John Faust  who stole my art and instruments and is set up at  Mentz  c  But nothing of this nature was ever done by  Coster  or his posterity which is a plain indication that this whole story is what  Salmuth  and other learned writers affirm it to be a mere old wife's fable without foundation or even probability How the devisers and publishers of it can maintain it with so much positiveness and vehemence with such calumnies invectives and ill language against persons of incomparable learning who could not give into such an absurd and legendary account is not my business to enquire I shall only observe that their charge upon a man of such conspicuous merit as  John Faust  recoils with double force and shame upon themselves for it proves them guilty of a crime more flagrant than what they accuse him of in endeavouring to deprive him not only of the glory of that invention in order to fix it upon an imaginary countryman of theirs but even of what is most valuable in the world his reputation upon the bare testimony and tradition of three old citizens whose memory is as justly questionable as their and  Junius  's impartiality in a case wherein the honour of their city and fellowcitizens is concern'd and what is still a greater aggravation of their unjust calumny to make use of  Faust  's noble discovery to publish and perpetuate his shame whose honour and memory ought rather to have been celebrated by it little did that good man think that his art would ever be put to so vile a use against himself  IN the mean time I must not omit to remark that of all the writers whom we have quoted for  Mentz  and of many more collected by the diligent  Malinkrot  in his  History of Printing  there is not one native of that city  Munster  indeed was born near it but educated at a greater distance and  Serrarius  tho' he liv'd sometime there was born in  Lorain  yet if such an objection had been just against ten or twelve of 'em there remains enough to fix the laurel on  Faust  's head But with respect to the old evidences of  Harlem  we only know what  Junius  is pleas'd to tell us of them that they were persons who serv'd several considerable offices in the city However  Malinkrot  makes a very shrewd remark upon one of  them  viz Cornelius  the Printer who in a sally of passion wish'd  Faust  had been then alive that he might have executed him with his own hands and was at that time as  Junius  relates above eighty years old now as this theft is pretended to have been committed  anno  and it appears from an edition of  Tully  's  offices  that  Faust  was living  anno  it is plain that in this space of years  Cornelius  might have had an opportunity of gratifying his revenge upon him if he had thought fit This circumstance therefore which was contriv'd to add weight to the story serves only to burlesque and overthrow it  I fear the reader is more weary of this argument than I could wish since there are two or three new allegations out of those who followed  Junius  which tho' of small weight I would willingly examine before I dismiss this chapter tho' it were only to shew what shifts they are driven to who undertake to support the credit of  Junius  's legend and to let the world judge whether such arguments are not more likely to overthrow than maintain this cause I shall here propose 'em with the utmost brevity  BOXHORN in his  Theatrum Hollandiae  triumphs upon the evidence of two eminent writers whom he has violently wrested to speak in defence of his claim One is the author of the  Cologn Chronicle  the other  Mariangelus Accursius  a learned man who flourish'd in  Italy  about the beginning of the sixteenth century The former writes to this purpose  Chronic Coloniens  Quamvis autem ut praemittitur  Moguntiae  ars haec inventa fuerit eo modo quo nunc temporis communiter usurpatur prima tamen ejus praefiguratio seu simulacrum ex  Donatis Hollandiae  reperta desumpta fuit qui ibi ante id tempus excusi fuerunt e quo illis principium artis depromptum est at posterior haec inventio priore quoad artificium subtilitatem longe praestantior fuit  N B  Theauthor wrote this  chronicle  in  High Dutch  but I could never procure the original and have been oblig'd to make use of  Malinkret  's translation of it  that  "altho' the Art of Printing had been found out at  Mentz  in the manner we now have it yet the first hints or pattern was taken from the  Donatus  of  Holland  which had been printed there that the aforesaid art took its origin from them tho' the latter invention is much superior in contrivance and ingenuity"  'Tis to be observ'd by the bye that this author wrote in the year almost years after the discovery and had these particulars from  Ulric Zel  an old bookseller then living at  Cologn  The next testimony is a passage written by  Accursius  upon the  first leaf of a  Donatus  printed at  Mentz  by  John Faust  as follows  Joannes Faust  civis  Moguntinus  avus maternus  Joannis Schoeffer  primus excogitavit imprimendi artem typis aereis quos deinde plumbeos invenit multaque ad poliendam artem addidit ejus filius  Schoeffer  impressus est autem hic  Donatus    Consessionalia  primo omnium  anno  admonitus certe fuit ex  Donato Hollandiae  prius impresso in tabula incisa  Theatr Holland  p    "  John Faust  citizen of  Mentz  grandfather by mother's side of  John Shepherd  was the first that devis'd this Art of Printing with brass types which he afterwards chang'd for leaden ones his son  Peter Schoeffer  added many other improvements to the art this  Donatus  and the  Confessionalia  were first printed in the year He certainly took the hint from the  Donatus  printed before in  Holland  upon wooden planks"  What this  Donatus  and other books of that sort were and whether really done in wood or otherwise with some other particularities relating to them shall be consider'd in a distinct chapter our present enquiry is how far they make for the cause of the  Dutch  writers  We will suppose that  Ulric Zel  was a man of as good a memory as those mention'd by  Junius  and that the second passage quoted was actually written by  Accursius  which is far from being certain let us now examine what both these writers do and what they do not affirm They affirm that this method of printing by fusile types was found out at  Mentz  by  John Faust  and improv'd by his soninlaw  Peter Schoeffer  that they printed some books in the year that there was a  Donatus  printed before that time upon wooden planks in  Holland  and that from the hint or as the chronicler terms it the model or pattern  vorbildung  of those wooden planks  Faust  began the new way of printing by fusile types tho' this last article seems only a conjecture of theirs  THEY do not affirm that the old method of printing on wood was the foundation of the new one that this  Donatus  was printed at  Harlem  rather than at any other place or by  Coster  than any other person tho' if they had asserted this it ought to be examin'd how they got that intelligence seeing it was not known in  Holland ann  in which year  Junius  dy'd that any such book had been printed there for that author who was indefatigable in collecting whatever favour'd his cause would never have fail'd to mention it and  Jos Scaliger  tho' he since declar'd  himself for  Harlem  formerly attributed this rude invention to the city of  Dort  they don't affirm that this  Donatus  was printed before the  Catholicon  of  Mentz  wherein lies the main point for tho' they say it was done before  Faust  had perfected his invention yet it does not follow that it was before he had begun to print with wooden planks Nothing therefore can be gather'd from these authors even with respect to this invention in wood that favours  Coster  or  Harlem  more than  Faust  or  Mentz  I have already observ'd that some of the  Dutch  writers are for dividing the glory between those two corrivals and particularly  Peter Berchius  in this he is follow'd by no less an author than  Boxhorn  so often mention'd for his zeal in this dispute He finding the impossibility of defending all the assertions of  Junius  is willing to come to a composition His words are these  Sed non difficile est hanc tam gravem ac tam nobilem controversiam quae clarissima nostri aevi ingenia exercuit componere nempe si vel id quod res est concedainus typos quidem ligneos a  Laurentio Harlemensi  primum fuisse inventos typo vero stanneos aereos plumbeos ad horum exemplar efformatos esse a  Joanne Fausto  cive  Moguntino  Boxhorn  Theat Holland  "It will be no difficulty to reconcile this great and weighty controversy which has exercis'd the greatest wits of the age if we will as indeed we ought yield the honour of the old wooden invention to  Coster  of  Harlem  and that of metal types to  John Faust  citizen of  Mentz  "  But this accommodation is attended with this disadvantage that it will set the  Dutch  writers at variance not only with one another but also with themselves whereas 'tis much better in my opinion to continue in war with the whole world than to bring a domestick one into their own bowels A consequence still worse is inevitable for what will become of the pompous story of  Faust  's robbery And of those creditable evidences mention'd by  Junius  Would not they with the utmost vehemence protest against such a partition treaty And old  Cornelius  the false accuser deserve the most sanguinary treatment to be retaliated on him from some angry  Moguntine  Will not the drinking cups those noble relicks of  Coster  's metal types run the risque of being turn'd into vessels of dishonour And all the inscriptions in his praise his statues and even his house at  Harlem  be liable to some such dismal fateIf we should yield them this invention of wooden planks so  eagerly contended for or agree with the more moderate of their writers that  Faust  and  Coster  tho' at so great a distance happen'd upon it together or grant to  Boxhorn  that  Harlem  was the mother and  Mentz  the nurse of these two discoveries and that the one is but an improvement of the other yet  Coster  would not have deserv'd half of the incense bestow'd on him nor  Faust  the least part of the calumnies which he has suffer'd In vain were such shifts and forgeries used to deprive him of so small and inconsiderable share of his glory whilst the far greatest part of it which could not be touch'd was more than sufficient to make him outshine and even eclipse his rival for whose sake he was so ungratefully treated Had not he been bless'd with a genius vastly superior to that of his suppos'd competitor or contented himself without aiming at a more useful and expeditious method than the first the common wealth of letters had receiv'd as little advantage from his discovery as his own name and memory from those  Dutch  writers were they the only persons to transmit them to posterity However if their partiality and adherence to  Junius  have influenc'd them so far as to make such returns for those improvements which they are oblig'd to acknowledge that he made common justice will oblige me to acquaint the reader that other writers of that country of equal learning and a more generous nature have been so far from joyning with them that they have ascrib'd the invention to  Faust  alone I have before quoted an encomium of the great  Erasmus  upon him and his art and shall close this chapter with another out of the learned  Opmer  of  Amsterdam  who dy'd about the year  i e  years after  Junius  and has left us the following testimony in his posthumous book of  Chronography  Etenim hoc anno  Moguntiae  a  Joanne Fausto  ars imprimendi exerceri coepta est fuerat is avus  Joan is Shoefferi  chalcographi nostrae aetatis vir dignus ut celebretur  Quid quod sub mundi vesperam instante supremo jam die inter caliginosas impiorum atque discordiarum feralium procellas rarae pietatis

acutissimis ingeniis annumerandus  Opmer op posth p    edit Colon    "This year the art of printing  began to be exercis'd at  Mentz  by  John Faust  who was the grandfather of  John Schoeffer  a printer of this age and worthy the highest encomiums"  In another place in the beginning of the th book there is the following elegant panegyrick upon the art and inventor  "that at the decline of the world when the last day seem'd to approach so many men of accomplish'd learning and singular piety should break forth like bright stars with unusual lustre thro' the tempestuous clouds of deadly discord so that you would have thought the world had been recover'd from a long disease and gradually reassumed its lost strength the arts and sciences this was effected by the assistance of that art which from metal characters of letters ingeniously cast dispos'd in the order in which we write spread over with a convenient quantity of ink and put under the press has usher'd into the world books in all languages and multiplied their copies like a numerous offspring and has obtain'd the name of Typography This  art of Printing  was most certainly invented and brought to light by  John Faust  in the year It is amazing that the author of so important a discovery and so generous a promoter of divine and human learning should be unworthily traduc'd by a writer of the  German  affairs surely such a person deserves eternal remembrance and a place amongst men of the brightest genius"  Who this  German  writer was our author no where tells us but it seems as if his unnatural usage of his own countryman had taken off  Opmer  's wonder at the like treatment from the  Dutch  writers If it should be asked what converts these last have made among other nations I can only answer that I know of none  THE generality of writers have esteem'd  Junius  's story unworthy of either credit or confutation and if any of the moderns seem neuter or doubtful in this case it is more owing to a peculiar affectation of modesty than either to any design of complimenting the  Dutch  or fear of being mistaken in so evident a matter  CHAP VI An Enquiry into the  first Books  printed on  Blocks  of  Wood  viz the  Donatus Speculum  c  AS the reader may reasonably think there is something exceilent in these Books either for beauty of impression learning correctness  c  from the great noise which they have made among the writers of this controversy I must begin with acquainting him that their whole merit consists only in their being look'd upon by them as the very first essays of the art of printing even before the invention of fusile types This is so far from admitting of any controversy however some of them may have been misled into a contrary opinion that their being printed only on one side of the paper and afterwards glew'd together on the blank side from which they were call'd  paginae conglutinatae  is a very pregnant proof of their being done after the first method  viz  upon wooden blocks tho'we shall not only corroborate the fact by many other undeniable arguments in the sequel of this chapter but even lead the reader into so plain a method of judging of those works from those printed by fusile types that he will not have the least room left to doubt of it  As for the  Donatus  so strenuously insisted upon by  Bertius  and others in favour of  Harlem  it is a question whether there be one copy of it extant seeing 'tis not to be met with in any of those curious libraries I have either seen or heard of nor could ever be procured by any of our searchers into these antient monuments tho' they have spar'd neither pains nor cost to have it sought for far and near to which let me add that no author I am acquainted with has pretended to have seen it if we except  Angel Rocha  who in his  Bibliotheca Vaticana  printed at  Rome  in the year  to  pag tells us that  Aldus Manutius jun  r    shew'd him a grammar of  Donatus  printed on vellum upon one of the first white leaves of which  Mariangelus Accursius  a learned author living in  Italy  about the year had wrote as he suppos'd with his own hand the following words in latin  "that this  Donatus  and another book entitled  Consessionalia  were the first printed books and that  John Faust  citizen of  Mentz  and first inventor of the Art of Printing had printed them  ann  "  as has been said in the last chapter  FROM this account of  Accursius  it is plain  first  that this  Donatus  bore neither date nor name of place or printer otherwise he need not to have been at the trouble of guessing at them  Secondly  That  Donatus  is the name of the author not of the book and that it was only a grammar for boys for so  Rocha  calls it in the place before quoted to which we may add that in the last list which the first Printers at  Rome  gave of their works to the Pope they call it  Donatus pro pueris  so that it could not be such a trifling thing as some authors have thought it who only call it a Primer The  third  thing I would observe from this passage is that  John Faust  who is here call'd the first inventor of printing is affirm'd to have printed it at  Mentz  but what has puzled the world is what the same author adds at the end of the passage  viz that  Faust  did certainly take the hint from the  Donatus  in  Holland  first printed on Blocks of wood  which for that very reason those authors who have follow'd him have thought fit to make years older and have suppos'd them printed about the year I might indeed have omitted this passage seeing  Accursius  seems to hint that this book of his was printed by fusile types but as it was the only one that has been seen by any author and confirms some of our former assertions I thought it would not be amiss to insert it especially considering that it was not impossible for  Accursius  to be mistaken in his judgment of its being printed after the new method of separate types as many other learned men have been in the like case The merit of this quotation has been examin'd in the last chapter and it is plain that all the authors that have mention'd the date of this book such as  Beughen Boxhorn Bertius  and others have taken it upon trust as well as what they affirm of its being done upon wooden blocks since none of them pretend either to have seen it or to have taken it from any author that had and if we should admit what  Accursius  affirms that those suppos'd  dutch ones  were older than this he wrote upon it will make it still plainer that they had neither date printer nor place's name since this which is suppos'd ten years younger is without any of them The same may be said of the other books I am now going to give an account of  viz  the  Speculum Ars moriendi  c which are in the Earl of  Pembroke  's curious collection none of which tho' they seem to be improvements of one another has the least mention of time place or printer  However as to their being engraven upon wooden blocks and consequently being the first essays or as some antiquaries call them the first  Maculatures  of the art I am fully convinc'd both by the ink with which they are printed  viz  the common writing ink and by some undoubted trials I have made of them I shall therefore lay down the following rules to distinguish between books printed on blocks of wood and separate metal types  First  Let an  m w  or any other remarkable letter be curiously examin'd both as to its length breadth and shape and compare it with the same letter in another word if they vary either in similitude or size you may be assur'd they are not metal types since the most curious lettercutter writingmaster or engraver cannot make any two letters so alike but a nice observer will distinguish one from the other on the contrary in separate metal types each letter being cast in the same matrice it is impossible there should be the least difference either in shape or size  Secondly  Another way is by choosing any word the longer the better take the length of it with the points of the compass and compare it with the same word in another place and if you find them both of the same length you may depend upon their being printed with separate metal types for as each letter is cast in the same mould it is impossible that their length should vary but in writing and engraving there will be a visible difference in the same word in various places  Thirdly  Measure the length of a page tell the number of lines in a full one and take the white spaces between each line and by comparing them to any other full page in the book if they are printed with metal types there can be no variation in any of these respects whereas if they were done in wood it would be as impossible for them to agree in any one instance as it would be to engrave or write any two pages wherein there should be no visible variation in some one or more of the foremention'd particulars It was by these methods that I distinguish'd in the  sive  books in the Earl of  Pembroke  's  Library  what was done on wood and what by separate metal types  MELCHIOR ADAMUS and after him the learned  Malinkrot  and some others tell us of separate wooden types cut with a knife which were us'd by the first Printers before the discovery of casting them into metal but besides that this seems inconsistent with the most authentick testimonies we have quoted hitherto concerning this invention whoever considers the vast time and trouble it would require to cut such a quantity of them as is necessary to print any moderate work the great difficulty of making them stand exactly upright and even in line and body how liable they would be to split break warp shrink and swell with continual wetting and the weight of the press with many more such like inconveniences and difficulties will easily judge not only of the absurdity of this notion but also of the impossibility of any of those old books being printed by any such types since it is obvious to every eye that no one single work could have come perfect out of their hands for the reasons abovemention'd  BEFORE I dismiss this point I must not omit acquainting the Reader with a mistake into which  Chevillier  has been unwarily drawn even when he took the surest method of coming at the truth concerning one of these books in question  viz  the  Speculum Salutis  he tells us  pag  and of his  Origin of Printing  that having one of them in his own possession and having met with another in the library of the  Celestin  Monks at  Paris  he had the curiosity to have them examined by a Printer a Founder and an Engraver who judg'd them to be printed with separatemetaltypes so that those who have read his book have thought it a sufficient ground to alter their opinion of their being done on wooden blocks But this mistake of  Chevillier  's proceeded from his not examining the whole book because as I shall shew anon there were many leaves supply'd afterwards by separate metal types one of which he had the misfortune to light upon otherwise they must have manifestly seen the difference  I come now to give the reader an account of the other  five  books  viz Ars Moriendi  the  History of the Apocalypse  the  History of the Bible  the  Speculum Salutis  and the  Spiegel  or  Speculum  translated into  Low Dutch  That these however are not all that was done upon wooden planks is plain because  Trithemius  tells us of the  Catholicon  first printed upon wood  Scaliger  speaks of a  Psalter  of the same stamp which his grandmother had and other antiquaries mention several others not worth inserting here all which are either perish'd or are as yet undiscover'd however I cannot omit the  Speculum  and some others seen by  Saubert  in the  Nuremberg  library of which he was keeper and mention'd by him in the catalogue of that library call'd in latin  Bibliotheca Norica  which books were printed in  High Dutch  and may justly be suppos'd some of  Faustus  's first  Tentamina  or essays from  ann  to but as that author has only given us the names without any further account of them I shall pass them by and return to the  five  abovementioned which are no where to be met with together but in that noble Collection of the Right Hon the Earl of  Pembroke  and as no one besides my self has describ'd them all I hope the reader will not be displeas'd if I give him a more particular account of them than any but a Printer could possibly have done They are all  five  printed on a very small  Folio  I  ARS MORIENDI  or  SPECULUM MORIENTIUM  IT is a moral treatise upon the subject of dying well with wooden cuts suited to the taste of the Romish church a sick man is figur'd lying in his bed with angels and devils attending him the one to tempt the other to strengthen him to which end the designer has made labels from their mouths to express the intention of each the designs of this first book are somewhat better drawn than those of the rest for in that age as well as ours there were good and bad painters or designers but the presswork is the worst of the  five  this induces me to think this piece to be the oldest and its wanting the several improvements which we find in the others does not a little confirm me in my conjecture for  first  it is printed with common writing ink without any gum which is plain from its spreading it self and soaking into the paper so that in many places it is scarce legible and the ink is grown withall so pale by length of time that it doth but just show it self at the best  secondly  it seems to have received several degrees of improvement as the work went on and is better printed and with better ink the nearer it draws to the end the  third  circumstance that proves its priority to the rest is that it hath  neither the capitals A B C  c  which are now call'd Signatures at the bottom of the first pages of each sheet nor any direction word at the end of each page which is a guide to the bookbinder how to place the sheets this improvement we find in the two next books  II  The HISTORY of the APOCALYPSE  THIS book which I venture to give the second rank to hath the advantage of being printed with better ink than the former which makes it much more legible it appears to have some gum dissolv'd with the ink which was one of the first improvements that was made to the common sort of ink it has likewise the signatures at the top of each page of the sheet This piece contains the history of St  John  the  Evangelist  in forty six pages each having some figures ill cut representing some part of that saint's life the cuts are interspers'd with short sentences arguments and explications in Monkish latin prose likewise cut in wood after an indifferent manner the paper has the mark of the  heiffer's LABEL and horns  which is allowed to be the mark in the paper  Faust  used  III  The HISTORY of the BIBLE  THIS contains only histories out of the Old and New Testament promiscuously blended together with wooden cutts better perform'd tho' worse drawn than any of the two foregoing it has likewise the arguments and explanations of each cut and the paper seems to be the same with that of the  Apocalypse  it has also the improvements of ink and signatures  These were in all probability the first SIGNATURES the th and th here have them not nor the books with  Faust  's name And tho' the Terence printed at  Milan  has them yet  Spira  and  Jonson  printed afterwards without nor have they us'd them in  France  in yet in the same year they were us'd at  Oxford    IV  The SPECULUM HUMANAE SALVATIONIS  IT is commonly called  Speculum Salutis  or the  Mirrour of our Salvation  and is a comparative history of the old and new testament it is written  in Monkish latin verse rhim'd This is by far the most perfect of the two I have seen  that  which  Dr Mead  shew'd me wanted many leaves but  this  only two it consists of fifty six pages and each page has two columns of verses which are so well cut that were it not for some differences in the magnitude and shape of the same letters one might easily be induc'd to think them printed with metal types and I believe this is the reason that made some authors suppose them to be done with separate wooden types I have already taken notice of the improbability of that notion  V  De SPIEGHEL  THIS is only a translation of the  Speculum Salutis  into  Flemish  it was upon this book that Dr  Junius  and the other  dutch  writers who have followed him lay so great a stress and upon whose antiquity preferable to all others they ground their claim to the invention of printing in favour of  Coster  However it is very plain that the  Latin  one is prior to this and that  this  is only a translation of  that  because the wooden cuts are the same in both the latin explanations at the bottom are left untranslated and the cuts are printed with the same pale gum'd writing ink as in the  Latin  one rather brown than black whereas the body of this work is compos'd with separate metal types and printed with an ink as remarkable for its blackness as any sort since made use of it has also in several places the same mark in the paper  viz  the  heiffer's LABEL and horns  acknowledg'd by Mons  Naudé  to be the mark in  Faust  's paper In the  Latin Speculum  a great many pages are supply'd with the same separate metal types presswork and ink as the body of this whole  Flemish  one and has all the appearances sufficient to convince any one of its being done at the same time and by the same hand one of which  supply'd  pages of the latin  Speculum Chevillier  happen'd to pitch upon when he shew'd it to the Printer Founder and Engraver before mention'd There is one circumstance worth noting which is that the  Speculum salutis  tho' cut on wood each page consists of two distinct pieces the LABEL piece is the draught or representation of the history the lower piece is the history itself in two columns and if I may venture to account for this motled  work it must be by supposing that after they had cut the design they might print several proof sheets as is usual now to see if it needed any amendment which proof sheets of the draughts only together with a compleat book of the latin  Speculum  might afterwards fall into the hands of some  dutch Printer  who got it translated into  low dutch  and printed it with separte metal types upon the same proof sheets under the designs which were before printed at the LABEL of the page and this will evidently appear from the manifest difference of the ink as before mention'd  THERE remain still two points to be examin'd with relation to the  Donatus  whether it be the first book printed with wooden planks whether it was done by  L Coster  at  Harlem  To the first there is only the testimonies of  Ulric Zel  citizen of  Cologn  who relates what was done almost fifty years ago and of  Mar Accursius  who wrote in  Italy  what he heard was done at a still greater distance from him To these who could not possibly be acquainted with every circumstance of this discovery we may reasonably oppose the authority of  Trithemius  for he learn'd what he tells us not from report and uncertain tradition but from the mouth of  Peter Schoeffer  who related nothing but what he was an eyewitness of or rather particularly interested in Now  Trithemius  ascribes the invention of wooden blocks to  J Faust  and asserts that the  Catholicon  was the first book of any consequence printed in that manner and that his next step was the more ingenious invention of separate metal types  LET the world judge whether his testimony be not far preferable to that of the two former  Scriverius  indeed and after him Mr  Beughen  affirm the  Donatus  to have been printed  anno  but give no reason for their fixing on that year rather than any other and it is manifest from what they say before that they only proceed upon a supposition that this method being discovered about that time this book which is perhaps the least considerable of those which were printed then might be one of the first essays of it However let the  Catholicon  the  Donatus  or any other be the first book printed in  Europe  with wooden planks yet there is no ground of boasting it to be the first in the world since the  Chinese  practis'd that way of Printing at least years before either  Faust  or  Coster  were born  THE next consideration is where and by whom it was printed The  Dutch  attempt two ways of proving it was done by  Coster  at  Harlem  the first is that of  Junius  who pretends that it was one of the first tryals of  Coster  's metal types but this has been so fully confuted that they have been oblig'd to recur to another shift which is that  Coster  invented the engraven planks and with these printed the  Donatus  and  Speculum Salutis  and that from this  Faust  took the hint of inventing metal types an improvement of the former method  Alibi enim ars alibi ornamenta artis inventa illa inter  Hollandos  haec inter  Germaniae MoguntinosHarlemum Tipographiae  velut matrem  Mogunt am  autem nutricem fuisse alumnam ibi superatum quicquid in novae rei exordiis impeditum hic additam majorem arti speciem facilitatem  Boxhorn de Art Typogr invent  p  As the latter part of this assertion has receiv'd a sufficient answer in the second chapter and elsewhere so I need not insist long upon a confutation of the former part  i e  the books themselves since they carry no evident characteristick nor are affirm'd with certainty by any author to have been done in  Holland  No doubt the  Latin Speculum  is the original and the  Dutch  only a translation since as I observ'd before the latin arguments under the figures are left untranslated The learned  Saubert  likewise tells us in his  History of the  Norimbergh  library  that he hath seen several books there printed in  high dutch  after this manner one of which is the  Speculum  Quae ligno incisa sunt huc non refero v g libellum fabularum similitudinum qualis est  D Hartlhorni  libellus  Germanicas  itemque  Speculum Mortentium Speculum Salutis  id genus alia  Saubert Histor Biblioth Norimberg  p  Who can therefore determine which is the most antient or where they were printed If the  Dutch  one could be done no where but in  Holland  because it is in  low dutch  by parity of reason the  high dutch  must have been printed in  Germany  and as to the  Latin  it will remain still undetermin'd whether it was done in the one or the other and nothing will be certain concerning it except that it must have been printed before the translations From the whole of what has been said it is apparent that all the proofs which the  Dutch  bring either from facts or authentick writers confute rather than support their pretensions and I hope by this time the reputation of  Faust  is sufficiently clear'd from the two fold wrong done it by those who endeavour to deprive him of his due honour and asperse him with the vilest accusations of treachery and theft and that the reader  not only esteems him acquitted of both but is satisfy'd that neither  Coster  nor  Harlem  have the least share in this discovery  BEFORE I conclude this chapter I cannot omit a conjecture of the ingenious Mr  Mattaire  which will be a considerable confirmation of what has been said before He tells us  De loco opifice incertiora adhuc sunt omnia Si pro  M  guntia  pronuncietur non multum haerendum erit de opificibus tribus scilicet antea celebratis aut tempore quod  anno  quo primum juxta receptam hactenus a plerisque opinionem integrae Typographiae opus per  Johannem Fust    Petrum Schoeffer  elaboratum prodiit fuerit forte vetustius opus enim minus perfectum oportet perfectiori praeivisse sin autem cui  Argentina  plus placeat aut quam cur duarum malim postea aperiam  Harlemum Guttenbergus  quem quidam  Argentinam  migrasse potior vero de qua deinceps disseram authoritas  Harlemi  consedisse affirmat haec primae suae artis molitus est rudimenta non qui em ante annum quo accidisse fertur inter ipsum  Faustumque  dissidium quae ipsi fuit migrandi causa neque forsan multo post quo perfectior innotuerat imprimendi ratio  Annal Typ  graph  p  that he is inclin'd to think the books beforemention'd were printed at  Harlem  rather than at  Mentz  or  Strasburgh  because tho'  Guttenbergh  remov'd at first to the latter soon after the sentence pronounc'd against him by the judges of  Mentz  yet it appears from several authors even of our own nation that he either suspecting his safety there and a farther prosecution from  Faust  for the money adjudg'd to him by the decree and deed mention'd in a former chapter or upon some other reason came afterwards to  Harlem  in this city he is suppos'd by our author to have taught the art to  Coster  and practis'd it with him about the year If this be admitted which has all the air of probability to recommend it  Coster  will be left entirely destitute of his former glory The reader will find Mr  Mattaire  's proofs for what he advanceth concerning  Guttenbergh  's printing at  Harlem  in his book before quoted  Ibid a  pag  ad    Quae ex  Lambethano  MS descripsit de eo rum veritati cur dubitemus non video ex iis itaque pauca mecum colliget lector alibi forsan non ediscenda    Johannes Guttenbergus

whom he has extracted them I shall close this controversy of  Harlem  with the words of  Malinkrot  Non hercle  Harlemicae  silvae spatiis non  Batavicus  deambulationibus non  Hollandico  otio tam laboriosae artisanxium difficilem partum debemus sed  Mogu  tinus  potius sudoribus  Rhenanae  industriae difficilibus nixibus  Germa  i  ae  assiduitatis indefessae operationi continuae multorum annorum instantiae llum acceptum fe  e tenemur  Typograph cap    pag    "'Tis not the spacious  woods of  Harlem  nor the fine walks of  Holland  nor the supineness of its inhabitants that could produce an art so difficult and laborious but 'tis to the strenuous endeavours of the city of  Mentz  and the assiduous and indefatigable industry of the  Rhenish  nation for many years together that we are indebted for it"  CHAP VII The Pretensions of  Strasburgh  confuted  IN the two former chapters the falsity of the charge against  John Faust  has been so fully demonstrated that one would have reasonably expected the ill success of this accusation and the many learned advocates that appear'd in his defence might have been sufficient to deter the most sanguine of mortals from a second attempt upon so great a man Nevertheless the reader must have patience to hear him arraigned at another bar for the like crimes committed about the same time tho' upon another person and at another place distant several hundred miles from the former  FOUR years after the publication of  Boxhorn  's  Dissertatio de Typographiae inventione inventoribus  printed at  Leyden  there started up another who in a small treatise intitled  Brevis de loco tempore authore Typographiae excursus  pretended to prove that  Faust  stole the art of Printing from  John Mentel  at  Strasburgh  'Tis true this author was asham'd to set his name to it but neither that nor the meanness of his performance hinder'd the diligent  Malinkrot  who was then writing his treatise  de ortu progressu artis Typographicae  against  Junius  and his followers from confuting it Hereupon  James Mentel  doctor of physick at  Paris  a man of learning and great grandson of  Mentel  the first  Strasburg  Printer of that name publish'd a book call'd  Paraenesis de vera Typographiae  igine  at  Paris anno  wherein he undertook to make good the charge which the anonymous author had laid against  Faust  and challeng'd the glory of the invention in favour of his ancestor Tho' no particular answer to this book has been publish'd yet there is not one writer  upon this subject that I know of that has not taken occasion to confute or at least to say something to discountenance it I should therefore esteem my self wanting to this art and its inventor should I omit giving a short account of this controversy and expose the vanity of such an attempt especially because it may be thought that Dr  Mentel  would not have troubled the world with it so soon after the other unless he had had something more weighty to alledge in favour of  Strasburgh  than the  Dutch  had for  Harlem  I hope to propose the arguments on both sides so fairly that the reader will easily judge of the pretensions and merit of this new competitor and with such brevity that he will not be tired with it by referring still to the quotations in the margin without interruption to the story  THE first evidence alledg'd by Dr  Mentel  is an old  Strasburgh  chronicle of equal authority with the  Harlem  tradition to this purpose  Anno millesimo quadringentesimo quadragesimo  als zum drittenmahl c quae Latine  sic sonant cum e tribu Vietorum

Printing was invented at  Strasburgh  by the incomparable  John Mentel  who dwelt in the  Fronhoff  market and at the house commonly called  Viergarten brothelhouse  which divine invention he communicated to a servant of his of great ingenuity and dexterity by name  John Gensfleich  a native of  Mentz  that he might be assisting to him in the business But this treacherous fellow had no sooner learn'd the mystery but he serv'd his master a base trick by associating himself with his counrryman  J Guttenberg  a wealthy silversmith who began to smell out something of the art having been employed by  Mentel  to make some necessary tools and discovering to him the secret  which he had been intrusted with by his master These two hoping to make themselves famous by this art but being fearful of divulging it at  Strasburgh  where the inventor liv'd resolv'd to remove thence and settle at  Mentz  "  WITH respect to this chronicle and the writer of it we only know what our author tells us in his translation inserted at the bottom of the page for the chronicle is written in  high dutch  As it wants therefore some better authority for its support Dr  Mentel  brings as a confirmation of it the testimonies of the writers quoted in our third chapter who make mention of  Guttenberg  's carrying the art from  Strasburgh  to  Mentz  where he perfected it by the assistance of  John Faust  alias  Gensfleich  whose words are not therefore necessary to be repeated here In the next place he alledges an inscription which with  Mentel  's coat of arms was put at the beginning of  Otho Brunsfield  's  Onomasticon  printed at  Strasburgh  by  John Schott anno  importing  Insigne  Schottorum  familiae ab  Frederico Romanorum  III imperatore  Jeanni Mentelin  primo Typographiae inventori ac suis concessum anno p  that these arms of  Schott  's family had been given to  John Mentelin  first inventor of the art of Printing and to his posterity by the Emperor  Frederic  III  anno  After this he gives us a  latin  epigram written by  Erhard Windsberg  and inscrib'd to the three famous  Germans  who set up the first Printingpress at  Paris  In the first verse of this he has thought fit to change the word  Alemannia Germany  for these of  tu Argentina thou Strasburgh  as more proper for his purpose  THE book at the end of which are these verses is the  Epistles of  Crates  the Cynick  printed by  Martin Crantz  and his two partners beforemention'd  anno  not at  Strasburgh  as our author would fain insinuate to his readers but at  Paris  where it is still extant in the library of the  Sorbon  and was seen among others by  Chevillier  who has occasionally confuted  Mentel  's supposition and expos'd his unfair quotation of the epigram pag of his  History of Printing  as we shall shew in its proper place  THIS is all that I can find in  Mentel's  book which has the appearance of argument the rest consists chiefly in digressions and quotations in praise of the art and of the  German  nation which are entirely foreign  to this controversy In short our author shews himself more desirous of appearing zealous for his ancestor's honour than solicitous what credit his work will merit among the learned I shall give an instance or two of this and proceed to the confutation of his main arguments  IN page he gives us a piece of a comedy written by the famous  Swedish  poet  Nicodemus Frischlin  but is pleas'd to overlook the lines quoted by us before at p in which he affirms  John Faust  citizen of  Mentz  to have been the inventor of the art tho' they are at a very small distance from the passage quoted by him what is still more remarkable is that  Mentel  affirms that our  Swedish  poet dedicated this dramatic piece to the senate of  Strasburgh  which he would scarce have done had he dreamt any thing of that city's claiming the glory of this invention against his Hero  John Faust  or heard any thing of the charge of theft alledg'd against him by the  Strasburgers  The other instance of his unfairness is no less considerable at  p  where having suppos'd that the  Rationale Durandi  was not printed 'till after the falling out of  Faust  and  Guttenbergh  viz  ann  to evade the force of the real date he says with a very serious air that he had credible information from men of great learning both Printers and others that it was wrong printed and that the figure I which is put before should have been after the X that instead of MCCCCLIX it should have been MCCCCLXI whereas Mr  Mattaire  assures us  Vide quaeso  Mentelii  in opinione falsa obstinati ipsiusque hominum ornatissimorum hallucinationem manifestam annus enim illius libri exprimitur non numeralibus litteris sed disertis verbis  Millesime quadringentesimo quinquage  imo nono Annal Typograph p    anno  col    that the year is not printed with numeral letters but in words at length  one thousand four hundred fifty nine  I can hardly suppose Dr  Mentel  could be mistaken for want of an opportunity of consulting the book itself seeing it is to be so easily met with in several  ibraries of  Paris  which stand always open to the learned and curious and I don't find he has been wanting in ransacking them to find out any thing to his purpose tho' should even this supposition about the date be allow'd it would not therefore follow that no books were printed before the year with  Faust  's and  Schoeffer  's names exclusive of  Guttenbergh  's as Dr  Mentel  attempts to persuade his readers for the  Psalmorum codex  printed  ann  mentions only the names of the two former and the  latter was never printed in any book that could yet be produc'd What is said will suffice I hope to give an idea of this author's sincerity whose three principal authorities I shall now examine  FIRST as to the  Strasburgh  chronicle we may reasonably be excus'd for not laying the same stress upon it that our author doth since the obscurity of the writer a suspicion of his partiality for his country's honourand a difficulty of believing a person in his own cause in opposition to a great number of more credible witnesses are obstacles almost invincible I am therefore inclin'd to think that the bare opposing of the chronicle of  Cologne  and  Trithemius  who assert that the art was first brought from  Mentz  to  Strasburgh  will be a sufficient confutation of it tho' there were no other authorities for the one nor arguments against the other However we have an unexceptionable witness to produce against this chronicle  viz  the learned  Wimpheling  who was not only an eminent citizen of  Strasburgh  and almost contemporary with the discovery of the art but is likewise quoted by Dr  Mentel  tho' his testimony be diametrically opposite to his purpose the first part of the passage is set down at length in  pag  wherein he attributes the whole invention to  John Guttenbergh  and tells us that he did not perfect it 'till he had been sometime at  Mentz  whilst  John Mentel  undertaking the same business printed a great many volumes very neat and correct and grew exceeding rich in a short time  Interea  Joannes Mentel  id opisicii genus incoeptans multa volumina castigate polite imprimendo factus est brevi opulentissimus  Wimphel loco  tat    This is all that  Wimpheling  says of  Mentel  nor has any author except that of this  Strasburg  chronicle mention'd or suppos'd him to be the inventor but only one of the first that practis'd that art at  Strasburgh  and if the reader will recollect what most of the writers quoted in the  third  chapter of this book have said concerning  Guttenbergh  's leaving  Mentz  and returning to  Strasburg  where some of them affirm him to have taught  Mentel  the art we shall not wonder that  Wimpheling  makes him the first inventor of it seeing he practis'd it there sometime before it was known that  Faust  had done the like at  Mentz  and was consequently the first Printer that  Wimpheling  might know of nor is it reasonable to suppose that  Guttenbergh  could have been weak enough to say any thing  of what had pass'd at  Mentz  between  Faust  and himself it being so little to his credit  MENTEL's next authority is taken from the coat of arms given to the family by the Emperor  Frederick  III for which there is no other testimony but the first leaf of the  Onomasticon  However supposing it to be authentick may we not with the greatest reason oppose to it the patent or privilege granted by the Emperor  Maximilian  to  John Schoeffer  in consideration of his being the grandson of  John Faust  the first inventor of the art of Printing this privilege being of much later date than the other may be reasonably enough suppos'd a retract  tion of the former which might have been surreptitiously obtain'd especially considering that  Faust  has the concurrent testimonies of writers and incontestable facts but  Mentel  only brings an old chronicle and the most precarious grounds to support his pretensions However the authentickness of this grant is not only much question'd by the generality of writers but has one material objection against it which is that the person to whom it was given never made any mention or shew of it in all the books printed by him at  Strasburgh  which according to  Wimpheling  's account were very numerous It seems to me surprizing that if he had really obtain'd such a noble testimony of his being the first inventor of Printing and had been so treacherously robb'd both of the secret and the glory of it by a faithless servant he had not made use of his Imperial Majesty's authority whose subject he was as well as  Faust  to confirm the honour of the invention upon himself and the shame of the theft upon the other But on the contrary there is not one book to be met with tho' we may reasonably think Dr  Mentel  was not negligent in such a search that was printed by  John Mentel  before the year and even this was without any mention of the place where it was printed as appears from the  Speculum morale  of  Vincentius  in folio which is the oldest book known to bear his name whereas  Faust  and his soninlaw put their names to their impressions almost sixteen years before that time as is plain from the  Psalmorum Codex  printed  ann  What is still more wonderful is that  John Mentel  never plac'd this coat of arms in any of his books as we can find for the oldest edition that hath it is the  Geographical work of Ptolemy  printed by his nieces son MDXX that is years after the invention  years after the grant and after  Faust  had begun to print in his own name even by  Mentel  's own confession  I come now to consider the epigram and Dr  Mentel  's wild inferences from it which he grounds upon a supposition that the  epistles  at the end of which it is printed were done at  Strasburgh  from which he would conclude that from this city not only the three first Printers of  Paris  to whom they are inscrib'd but also the most celebrated ones of  Europe  came His words are these  Ut ita consentaneum sit assevevare ab  ArGentorato  velut a ca pite hoc artificium primo fluxisse atquedimanasse Hinc ad cam suosque magnam partem  Tipographos  primores illos quorum meminit  Wimphelingus Erhards Windsberg  cujusdam  epigramma  quod habetur in calce  Epistolarum Cratetis  ubi ubivis gentium nam locus non ponitur quanquam putem  Strasburg  at certe novellis artis infantiam plane redolentibus literarum characteribus impressarum  c p      "So truly may it be affirm'd that this art at first flow'd from  Strasburgh  as from its fountainhead whence it dispers'd it self abroad to that city therefore and to the greatest part of her first Printers mention'd by  Wimpheling  is that epigram of  Erhard Windsbergh  directed which is at the end of  Crates  's  Epistles  wheresoever these are printed for there is no place nam'd tho' I shou'd rather think at  Strasburgh  they being done with some of the first types whose rudeness plainly shews the infancy of the art"  All this is said without any foundation and would scarce have deserv'd to be inserted here but that it afforded me an opportunity of shewing the reverse from the testimony of  Chevillier  who examin'd and compar'd the the edition of  Crates  's  Epistles  with the first impressions of these three Printers of  Paris  which are given under the first list and found them exactly alike they are all done upon the same paper with the same types ink  c  and demonstrate the infancy of the art He adds farther that there is a greater probability that these three partners came from  Mentz  than from  Strasburgh  tho' there is no record left of the particular place but of  Germany  in general because he finds a great conformity between their characters and impressions and those of  Peter Schoeffer  thus he tells us  p  of his  History of Printing  that the  Speculum  of  Zamora  printed by them at  Paris ann  bears a very great likeness with St  Jerom  's  Epistles  printed at  Mentz  their  Rationale Durandi  of with  Scheoffer  's  Speculum Harpianum  X  Praeceptorum  their edition of  Utinus  's  lenten Sermons  of with the  Scrutinium Scripturarum Pauli Burgensis  printed at  Mentz  from which the author reasonably concludes that it is more likely they came from the city of  Mentz  than from that of  Strasburgh  I shall now subjoin at the bottom of the page the epigram both as it is printed in the genuine edition of the  Epistles  and as  Mentel  has alter'd it  Erhardi Windsbergh epigramma ad Germanos librarios egregios Michaelem Martinum Uldaricum  Genuine Edition  Plura licet summae dederis  Alemannia  laudi  MENTEL  Plura licet summae dederis  tu Argentina  laudi  At reor hoc majus te genuisse nihil  Quod prope divinam summa ex industria fingis  Scribendi hanc artem multiplicans studia  Felices igitur  Michael Maremeque  semper  Vivite  Ulrice  ho  queis opus imprimitur  Erhardum  vestro non dedignemini amore  Cui fido semper pectore clausi eritis  I need not I believe point out to the reader the material difference between  Alemannia  and  tu Argentina  the latter of which were it authentick would undoubtedly determine the dispute on the side of  Strasburgh  but as the former is exactly according to the edition preserv'd in the  Sorbon  library ever since it was printed 'tis plain that author of the epigram who was probably a countryman and intimate acquaintance of the three Printers and corrected their editions adding sometimes a copy of verses in their praise did not design to particularise any city but to give the honour of the art to the  German  nation in general It is likewise probable enough that they might not come all three from one and the same city but perhaps each of them from a distinct one in which case the poet must have been forc'd either to name them all or disobliged one or two of them or spoil a good epigram and therefore rather chose to compliment them under the name of  Germans  without regard to the place of their birth  THO' I have now done with Dr  Mentel  yet before I close this controversy it will not be improper to observe that there are two cities more of  Germany  which have laid claim to this invention  viz Ausburgh  and  Russenburgh  in  Alsace  The first of these owes its original to a passage misunderstood in the supplement to  Polydore Vergil De rerum inventoribus  attributed by  Irenicus  to  Gilbert Cognatus  and printed  ann  in  o  it runs thus  "The art of Printing is reported to have been discover'd by the industry of  Peter Schoeffer  of  Ausburgh  or invented by some of his relations and cultivated by him"  'Tis plain here that  the author doth not say that the art was invented at  Ausburgh  but that the inventor was a native of the place in which he was certainly mistaken seeing  Schoeffer  who best knew the place of his own birth declares himself in all his inscriptions a native of  Gernsheim  a small town upon the  Rhine  a little below  Worms  Besides we have no books extant which are printed before the year at  Ausburgh  when  John Schuster  gave an edition of  Paul Orosius  's  Chronography  in  folio  The other town  viz Russenburgh  is likewise said by the same  Irenicus  to have been esteem'd by some writers the inventress of the art of Printing and that it receiv'd its name from the noise of the many Printingpresses at work in it but this name seems to be more antient than that art and no book printed there has been ever produc'd nor any author of antiquity mention'd it so that this was only a mistake in  Cognatus  if he was the writer of the book beforemention'd I hope that by this time enough has been said to satisfy the reader that all which hath been urg'd in favour of  Harlem Strasburgh  or these two last cities is unworthy to come into competition with these noble testimonies and facts we have alleg'd on the side of  Mentz  I shall therefore with the greatest pleasure dismiss this rough and tedious path of controversy and resume the thread of our history  CHAP VIII The Time of the Discovery of  Printing    THE difficulty of fixing the exact time of the discovery arises from these two reasons Because the inventors made many fruitless tryals and a great number of maculatures before they could bring the art to any tolerable degree of perfection Because the vast expences of such a discovery oblig'd them to keep it secret as long as possible or at least 'till they had reimburs'd themselves in some measure by finishing the  latin bible  which tho' a great and expensive work was most likely to compensate their pains and cost when finish'd This is the foundation of the disagreement between writers upon the subject which may however  be easily reconcil'd by attending to the different epocha's from which they date the discovery Some of them as  Wimpheling Palmerus Althamerus  c date it from the infancy of the invention of wooden blocks and assign the year Others as the author of the chronicle of  Cologn Trithemius Aventine  and many more from the invention of fusile types  anno    Andrew Thevet Angel Rocha  c fix the discovery of the former method in whilst others place the time of the second invention in or among whom are  Apianus  and  P Langius  Lastly  Philip Bergomensis  and  Peter Ramus  assign the year for the perfection of it To accommodate this discrepancy among all these authors it will be sufficient to say with relation to the first that they take their date from the time in which the invention of wooden blocks was perfected rather than from its infancy with respect to the last that they thought a ten years interval much too short for the transition from the infancy of the former to the perfection of the latter method and therefore allow'd a few years more than their predecessors had done As for those who fix the latter invention in they were such as esteem'd the first printed book to have been the  Catholicon  printed  ann  or perhaps the second impression of the  bible ann  or  Tully  's  offices an  as  Zwinger  and others suppos'd and allow'd some years more for the invention and perfection of the art Now 'tis plain that before the  Psalmorum Codex  as we have hinted there is not any book known to have been printed with an  imprimatur  at the end and it is equally certain that the learned knew nothing of this last book 'till the year in which  Peter Lambeck  publish'd the second part of his catalogue of the  imperial library  where this noble monument is preserv'd which is the reason that it is omitted in all the lists of the first printed books 'Tis not strange therefore that these writers for want of dates and facts should be oblig'd to guess as well as they could at the time of the discovery However we find that the chronicler of  Cologn Serrarius Sebast Munster  and others after them well enough reconcile this diversity of opinions by assigning the year for the former invention and for the latter To these if we add the authority of  Trithemius  who certainly had the best information in this matter from  Peter Schoeffer  a principal person in the invention it will be evident that about the year they began to apply  themselves to cutting or engraving upon wooden blocks after the  Chinese  manner and printed some books with them but that after the year they found out a more excellent way for these are  Trithemius  's words in the famous passage quoted in  chap    Post haec inventis successerunt subtiliora inveneruntque modum fundendi formas omnium Latini alphabeti literarum c    viz  of casting separate metal types this method they might have been devising and trying before that time  i e  during some part of the first ten years tho' they continued still printing after the old way 'till they had quite perfected the new one either to bring in a continual supply of money necessary or perhaps to keep the world from prying into the new discovery wherein they were engag'd  I have said nothing hitherto of the  dutch  writers who to make the time of this invention agree with  Junius  's story of  Faust  's pretended theft have put it back some above ten others twenty years how little credit they merit in this particular is already shewn and the reader will be still more convinc'd of it when he sees what shifts they are reduc'd to for want of authorities to oppose to the vast number of writers quoted on  Faust  's side not one of whom ever thought of fixing this remarkable epocha beyond the year  THEIR first authority is the inscription set over  Laurence Coster  's door by one of the citizens of  Harlem  which is mention'd by all the  dutch  writers and says that he found out this art  ann  but this is of too recent a date to be of any weight  SCRIVERIUS in his  apology against Naudé  makes the discovery two years older and gives us a  Chronographic  verse  hIC fago cXsC VI ptas La VreatI CVsplde for Mas  Scriver Apolog pro patr contra Neudeum  whose numerical letters make up the date of MCCCCXXVIII  Boxhorn  carries it still farther back  viz  to the year  BUT as the two former dates were affirm'd without any foundation this author has endeavour'd to confirm his own with something that might bear the appearance of authority and to reconcile it with the other two by affirming that  Coster  began to lay the foundation of this art  ann  tho' he did not perfect it 'till ten years after The author upon whose testimony he would have us believe it is one  Joseph Karro  a  Jewish  Rabbi who in a book intitled  Shulkan Aruch  or  Mensa instructa  extracted by him out of another Jewish book call'd  Arbugh Thurim  i e  quatuor ordines  tells us of an old chronicle printed at  Venice A M  which answers to our year MCCCCXXVIII This book of  Rabbi Joseph  he owns that he could never meet with yet he infers from what is said there that there could be no printing at  Venice  at that time unless  Harlem  had it some years before I shall content my self with giving  Boxhorn  's words in the margin  Circa

peritissimo  Johanne Buxtorfio  Locum hunc certe velim accuratius aspiciant qui habent  especially since neither his  Rabbi  nor himself have gain'd any credit in this particular as it would indeed be wonderful if a  Jew  should be believ'd before the concurrent testimonies of all the learned men in  Europe  If he wrote what  Boxhorn  quotes out of him he either was prodigiously mistaken or affirm'd it as is too common with his nation contrary to his knowledge tho' if we should deny that he ever wrote thus I can't see with what reason  Boxhorn  could resent it since he neither saw the book himself nor gives the author's name from whom he took it However leaving him and the rest of the  Dutch  writers to search for more authentick proofs than what they have hitherto alleg'd let us return to our own which if we dare rely upon as we have the greatest reason to do it will be plain that this art was first attempted about the year and about ten years after happily perfected by  John Faust  and  Peter Schoeffer  in the city of  Mentz  that tho' the former imperfect method was known in  China  some hundred years before we had it yet this latter the only one which deserves the name of printing was neither known nor practis'd 'till those two persons had communicated it to some of their servants by whom it was divulg'd and dispers'd over  Europe  and even beyond it This will appear more evident in the next and subsequent chapters  CHAP IX Of the first books printed by  Faust  and  Schoeffer    THERE has been frequent occasion of mentioning the  Catholicon  as the first tryal of the art of Printing according to  Trithemius  's testimony but as it is our design to speak of those only which are done with separate metal types and bear some certain date or mark of the Printer I shall suspend the account of it 'till I come to treat of its second impression by the same  Faust  and  Schoeffer ann    'T is certain that if only that book which bears the oldest date is to be esteem'd the first printed the  book of psalms  so often mention'd will bid the fairest for the first rank Nevertheless I can see no reason to depart so far from the testimonies of  Trithemius  and the  Chronicle  of  Cologn  as not to allow the preference to the  Latin Bible  which as they tell us was the first book to which the pious authors of this art thought fit to consecrate their labours In this opinion they have been follow'd by many learned and judicious writers both antient and modern particularly  Malincrot Chevillier de la Caille Paul Pater  and  Watson  I shall therefore select the strongest of their reasons add a few remarks of my own upon them and leave the decision to the reader  FIRST with respect to  Trithemius  's testimony which I think is unexceptionable seeing he affirms nothing but what he had from  Peter Schoeffer  's mouth He plainly enough intimates that the  Bible  was their first work when he says that the art was found out by degrees that after they had finish'd the discovery in speculation and came to put it in practice they were involv'd in many difficulties that  A primo inventionis suae  c  impressari namque b  am  Trithem loco su  ra citato  soon after or from the beginning of this invention when they went about printing the Bible  before they had finish'd the third quaternion or quire of four sheets the charges amounted already to four thousand  florins  a prodigious sum in those days If we duly consider these words we cannot but conclude the  Bi+ble  to have been the first book they engaged in Our author indeed mentions not the year in which it was printed but this might proceed from forgetfulness or want of information However since such a work could not be finish'd in a short time when the art was in its infancy the hands but few and unacquainted with the several branches of composition imposition correction distribution  c  we may suppose the invention to have been perfected in speculation about the year and yet to have required some time before it could be put in practice by reason of the difficulties arising in it so that it will be reasonable to allow a year or two more before the impression of the  bible  could be compleated This may in all probability be the reason why  Trithemius  who is always very exact in his  chronicles  and mentions the year of any fact when he is sure of it rather chooses to make use of a more general expression in this case  viz his temporibus  about this time when he speaks of the year if we recollect that he expresses himself in the same words in his first  Chronicle  we shall be oblig'd either to allow a larger scope to them or else suppose that the  Catholicon  which was done in wood and the  Bible  printed with metal types were finish'd at the same time which would be absurd  THE  Manuscript Cologn Chronicle  tells us that it was printed in the  Jubile  year in a large character such as is us'd in the impressions of  Missals  or  Mass books  which answers to our  Double Pica  This  Chronicle  was written in  high dutch ann  the author of which acquaints us that he had the particulars of this invention from  Ulric Zel  an old bookseller then living at  Cologn  As the original is not so well understood here I shall subjoin at the bottom of the page the whole passage in latin as I find it translated by  Malinkrot  Ars primum inventa in  Germaniae  urbe  Moguntina  ad  Rhenum  circa annum ab eo donec scriberetur  inventioni ejus corumque quae ad illam pertinent opera impensa fuit eoque anno qui  Jubilaeus  fuit coeptum fuit primim

honorabilis magistri  Ulric Zel Hanoviensis  narrantis ore cognovi qui etiam nunc hoc anno    Coloniae  Typographum agit  V d Malinkrot de arte Typog  p  the words are to this purpose  "that the art of Printing was found out at  Mentzann  that from that time to they were employ'd in perfecting it that they were  began to print books in the  Jubile  year and that the first that was printed was the  Latin Bible  in a large character  c  "  Here  Ulric Zel  's words are to be taken in a lax sense for he is far from saying that any thing in this kind much less the  bible  was finish'd in the year but only that they began then to set about printing it how long it was before they compleated it or what date it bore is what he neither doth nor perhaps could so well inform us of However tho' we cannot be certain either from him or  Trithemius  when this noble work was perfected yet it is manifest from their restimony that except some maculatures and small tryals the  Bible  was the first considerable piece printed by  Faust  I am not ignorant that Mr  Mattaire  in his  Annals  has declar'd himself of the contrary opinion but as he has not confuted any of the abovemention'd testimonies tho' he must have read them in the authors before quoted nor given any reason for his departing from them I have given preference to the judgment of so many learned writers confirm'd by two such considerable testimonies to his single opinion I apprehend but two tolerable objections against this the  first  is that not one of these  bibles  is known to be extant The  second  is that  Faust  cannot probably be suppos'd to have begun with so large and expensive a volume when a smaller would have been more proper for an essay and brought him a more speedy gain To the  first  I answer That this  bible  being so full of abbreviations  c  in imitation of the old way of writing and difficult to be read might undergo the same fate with many other books both MS and others to be thrown by and destroy'd when the fairer and more legible impressions came in vogue The learned  Saubert  in his  Oration de Bibliotheca Reipublicae Noribergensis  tells us that he had seen no less than eight copies of them in the  Norican  library without date colophon or any other mark of their being printed by  Faust  As I have not been able to procure  Saubert  's book I must content my self with giving the reader the passage out of  Paul Pater  in which this is mention'd it is as follows  Biblia Latina  quorum translatio  Divo Hieronymo  vulgo tribuitur circa sequentem  Moguntiae  in membrana impressa

ann  pag  "The  Latin Bible  commonly suppos'd to  have been translated by St  Jerom  printed at  Mentz  upon vellum about or the following year a copy of which  Faustus  sold at  Paris  for crowns as we related out of  Trithemius  is justly reckon'd among the first beginnings of this art by  Corn Beughen  in his  Incunab Typograph Amsterd ann    Henry Salmuth  likewise mentions another Bible publish'd  ann  at the end of which are these words  This present Rationale  c  was finish'd at  Mentz  by  John Faust  c  but  Salmuth  is doubtless mistaken in taking this book for the Bible of which it was only a short explanation A copy of this  Bern Malinkrot  tells us that he had by him I would not however be too positive that there was not a  Latin Bible  printed in the same year seeing  John Saubert  owns that he had seen eight copies of it in the  Norican  library without  Faustus  's colophon undoubtedly for the reason beforemention'd  viz  in order to sell 'em for Manuscripts"  From this passage it appears that there are eight bibles without  Faust  's mark preserv'd in that library and seen by  Saubert  tho' both he and  P Pater  took them for the second impression in which they are certainly mistaken Because this was printed  ann  and not  ann  Because it is so far from having been printed without a  colophon  that it has one of the fullest and plainest that  Faust  ever us'd at the end of any of his books the reader will see it when we come to the edition itself But 'tis not impossible but that there may be still more of these copies in some other libraries as yet undiscover'd The only intelligence which we had concerning these eight is owing to  Saubert  neither would these gentlemen have believ'd that there had been a  Psalmorum Codex  printed at  Mentz ann  tho' assur'd of it by  Trithemius  and  Zel  had not  Peter Lambeck  the Emperor's librarykeeper years ago told us that he  met with it in that famous library I have been likewise assur'd from the mouth of a gentleman of credit that a friend of his had seen one abroad with the date of and farther that 'twas his opinion 'twould be brought to  England  How many authors have had a notion that  Tully  's  Offices  was the first printed book yet time has produc'd no less than four printed before it exclusive of the  bible  now in question and may yet discover more concerning this  I come now to the  second  objection so much insisted upon by some  viz  that 'tis improbable  Faust  would begin his first essays with a volume so large and expensive when a smaller would have answer'd his purpose much better and brought an immediate gain My reply is That the great expence at first consisted in purchasing such a quantity of materials as the business requir'd and not in printing of the first book which was inconsiderable compar'd with that consequently a smaller volume would have been too slender a reimbursement for such great sums expended Besides we have shewn that they took up money of  Guttenbergh  for buying of parchment  c  and were not so straitned as before As  Faust  design'd to sell as many of his first printed books as he could for manuscripts in order to make up the cost which he had been at 'tis obvious that he must pitch upon some considerable and valuable book before his art was discover'd and where could he fix upon one more adapted to his purpose than this I will not insist upon the piety of the persons so conspicuous in all their inscriptions tho' our age may call it superstition which might have a great share in determining their choice I shall only add that as it was by no means adviseable for him to sell any of his first essays left they should betray his invention so it was most prudent to make them upon the first leaves of the Bible which if they succeeded would in time make him ample amends and if they did not the loss was no greater than if they had been try'd upon a  Donatus  or a  Primer  Besides none of our authors have affirm'd that he began to print the  bible  before he had perfected the art both in theory and practice and made a sufficient number of maculatures and other tryals which it was the most prudent way to burn as soon as printed off I shall leave this discourse of the first  bible  to the reader's choice either to close in with or dissent from us in allowing it the first rank and proceed now to the  remainder of our propos'd list It will be necessary however to acquaint him altho' we have given the preference to that sacred book upon the testimonies of so many antient and modern writers tho' it bears no date yet in the following list I am about to give him of these first impressions of  Faust  we chiefly inquire after such as carry either date or some other certain mark of the year in which they were printed for as to those that do not I shall speak of them afterwards and shew that those authors who thought to have found out their date have prov'd to have been in an error which will be a sufficient reason for us not to depend upon any others of the like nature  NEXT to the  Bible  we find  five  several impressions which have certainly been made between the years and The first of these which as we hinted is omitted in all the lists of the first books that have been printed before  Lambeck  's catalogue of the  Vienna  library is the  Psalmorum Codex  printed at  Mentz  upon Vellum  anno  concerning this what has been said already will suffice the colophon of it is in the  fourth  chapter p  THE  second  is the  Rationale Divinorum Officiorum  written by  William Durand  printed at  Mentz  upon Vellum two Years after the  Psalter  viz  anno  by  John Faust  and  Peter de Gernsheim  or  Schoeffer Malinkrot  who knew nothing of the  Psalter  reckons it the first printed Book next to the  Bible  and tells us that he purchas'd one of them which had formerly belong'd to a Monastery of  Franciscan  Monks destroy'd by the civil Wars the inscription of which is very near the same with that of the  Psalter  This  Rationale  is likewise in the Earl of  Pembroke  's Library where I saw it it is beautifully printed in Folio upon Vellum and is a singular Beauty as to Presswork  THE Supposition of  Malinkrot  and others that this was the first printed Book was the reason that  Father L'Abbé  a learned  Jesuit  began his List of printed Books from the Years of its date  viz  to and the author of the Supplement to  Bellarmin  's  Ecclesiastical  Writers makes this remark upon it That  Anno    John Faustus  having discovered the art of Printing first printed the Book of  Guill Durand de Officiis Ecclesiasticis  in the city of  Mentz  These authors were certainly  in the right seeing no book was then known of an older date but since the second part of  Trithemius  's  Chronicle  and the second volume of the  Imperiallibrary  have been publish'd we must look some years back for the first impression and give that rank to a more noble work  THE  Third  is the  Catholicon  a  Latin  vocabulary printed at  Mentz anno  the second time for the first impression was done upon wood This Book is likewise in the Earl of  Pembroke  's library where I saw it it is in a large folio and beautifully printed We have given the inscription of it in the fourth  chap  p in which tho' the printer's name is not express'd yet it was done by  Faust  and  Schoeffer  both from the similitude of its character paper  c  with that of their other works and because there were at that time no other printers either at  Mentz  or any where else This  Catholicon  is a kind of  Grammar  compil'd by  John  of  Genoa  a  Dominican Fryar anno  It is divided into four parts the last of which contains a dictionary of  Latin  words digested alphabetically There have been several editions of it in  folio  as  Chevillier  tells us who saw two of them one very old and without date the other printed at  Paris anno  by  Jodocus Badius  Another impression of it is done at  Lyons  by  Antony Du Ry anno  and augmented by  Peter Gille Furetiere  therefore was led into a palpable error when he affirm'd after  Dr Mentel  and  Father Jacob a Carmelite  that the first printed books known in  Europe  were  Durandus de Ritibus Ecclesiae  printed  anno  a bible printed  anno    St Austin de Civitate Dei  and  Tully  's  Offices  seeing here are no less than four printed books before the oldest of them besides this book  de Ritibus Ecclesiae  was not written by  William Durand  but by  John Stephen Durant  who was first president of the parliament of  Tholouse  and is therefore a different book from the  Durand  's  Rationale  we are now speaking of and of a much later date  THE  fourth  is the second edition of the  Latin Bible  printed  anno  in  folio  with the following inscription at the end  Presens hoc opus finitum ac completum ad eusebiam Dei industria in civitate  Moguntinà  per  Johannem Fust  civem  retrum Shoefer de Gernsheim  clericum Dioecesis ejusdem est consummatum anno incarnationis Dominicae MCCCCLX I in vigilil Assumptionis gloriosae virginis  Mariae    "This present  work was finish'd and perfected for the service of God in the city of  Mentz  by  John Fust  citizen and  Peter Schoeffer de Gernsheim  clerk of the same diocess it was compleated in the year of our Lord  's  incarnation MCCCCLXII on the eve of the assumption of the glorious virgin  Mary  "  I have seen one in the library of  Dr Mead  and another at the late Mr  Wooodman  's bookseller in Vellum and  Chevillier  saw two more at  Paris  in two volumes Of this bible  Walchius  Walchius decas fabularum generis humani printed at Strasburgh    in to pag    relates a story which ought to be mention'd here as far as respects the common opinion  Faust  went to  Paris  with some copies of it finely illuminated where he sold one of them for crowns and another for till at length he reduc'd his price to and crowns The great quantity which he sold and the exact likeness of every copy made it suspicious that they were done by a more easy and expeditious way than that of writing whereupon the buyers thinking themselves impos'd upon began a prosecution which oblig'd him to fly the country and return to  Mentz  Thus far  Walchius  who says nothing of  Faust  's being accus'd of magick as some others affirm What relates to the person of  Faust  will be best consider'd in the next chapter As to the  bible  itself 'tis my opinion that the reason why the generality of authors have thought this second edition to have been that which he sold for MS is that they scarce knew of any other book printed before it  Mr Le Gallois  in his treatise of the finest libraries pag  tells us that there was nothing printed before this bible of which  Faust  brought to  Paris quoiqui en soit il est certain qu' on ne voit rien a'imprimé avant c  tte Bible que  Faust  apporta luy meme a Paris Father de St Raomuld  affirms likewise in his  Thesaur Chronolog  pag that we have nothing printed before the year and the great  Naude  who in his addition to the history of  Lewis  XI says that he had seen about old books in or of the most celebrated libraries in and about the city of  Paris  and hath writ a treatise  ex professo  upon this subject in the aforemention'd book chap pag expresses himself thus "but we have no book printed before and pag  he says that we must needs suppose them the first printers to have made an infinite number of proofs and maculatures before they could justify and get all their implements fitted together after which they began at length to compose not  Tully  's  Offices  c but the great bible in  fol  o  which was finish'd anno  Vide  Chevillier  pag  but for my own part I cannot suppose that  Faust  would offer a book to sale for a written one which had such an inscription as must infallibly discover the cheat 'Tis urg'd that he might print a certain number of them without this and after the discovery reprint the last sheet with this colophon at the  end but this is improbable upon two accounts first he had already printed three books with inscriptions  viz  the  Psalter  the  Rationale  and the  Catholicon  all which import particularly  that they were not done with pen and ink or any writing tool but by a fine new invented art of casting Letters and printing with them  Now since some of these must of necessity have been known in  France  long before this year it was impossible to have deceiv'd them by any but the first impression unless we did suppose that he kept the three former unsold and unseen which would be most absurd to imagine But secondly 'tis plain that his design in selling them for MSS was to reimburse himself for the vast charges which he had been at in devising this invention preparing all the necessary materials making essays  c  Such expences must have reduc'd him above twelve years before this to the necessity of a recruit seeing he had perfected the new invention and began to print with it on or soon after the year as has been fully prov'd nor can we in any probability suppose that he should work on for twelve whole years successively and print three editions two of which were very large without vending them especially since he is reported by most authors to have enrich'd himself exceedingly by this time and consequently wanted no such strategem If I could have obtain'd with all my endeavours any certain information of the year in which he went to  Paris  it would have determined the dispute However if I may be allow'd a conjecture since we find by the unanimous consent of writers that the art was perfected in the year and no books printed in his name till  anno  as yet known  Faust  might most probably spend these seven years in Printing illuminating and selling his first  Bible  after which his new art being discover'd he thought it in vain to keep it secret longer and therefore in his next book gave the world an account of his method as we find in the  Psalmorum Codex  and those that follow'd it What confirms my conjecture is that  Guttenburgh  who was prosecuted by  Faust  for the moiety of the money expended and gave a deed bearing date for the payment pursuant to the judge's determination instead of complying with it escap'd to  Strasburgh  and left his partner in the lurch this we may reasonably suppose reduc'd  Faust  to such streights as oblig'd him to go to  Paris  with what books he had in order to sell them to the best advantage  These reasons induce me to think that it was the  first  and not the  second bible  which  Faust  sold at such extraordinary rates The reader is at his liberty to judge as he pleases in this matter  THE  fifth  is the  Tully's Offices  printed at  Mentz ann  tho' some editions have a later date by one and others by two years all of which are printed at  Mentz  with the same inscription in every respect as we shall shew immediately The Right Honourable the Earl of  Oxford  shew'd me this book 'tis a small  to  and very beautifully printed and well preserv'd Sir  Thomas Bodley  had this in his library which he presented to the university of  Oxford  where it is still kept Dr  James  publish'd a catalogue of all Sir  Thomas  's books intitled  Catalogus Bibliothecae Bodleianae  in  to anno  in the page of which book we find this  Tully  's  Offices  with the following inscription  Ejusdem liber de Officiis  c  an  About years after this  Dr Thomas Hyde  publish'd his catalogue of all the books in the university library printed at  Oxford  in  fol ann  in which he gives the date of the book  pag  which is the same with the former and confirm'd by  Antony Wood  's history of that university printed likewise  ann    pag    Immo anno Domini ut fert aliud exemplar in  Bodleiana  bibliotheca  Mr  Beughen  mentions the same date in his list of the first editions  Moguntia  in  to  ann quae postmodum sunt recusa ibidem  an  in  to    Romae    c Incunab Typograph    and tells us that it was reprinted at  Mentz  two years after  viz ann  and at  Rome  Father  'Abbé  Nov Biblioth  MSS  lib septim  pag  speaks of one which he saw in the  French  king's library dated and  Chevillier  saw another in the library of the  Mazarincollege  with these words in red letters  Praesens  M Tulli  clarissimum opus  Joan Fust Moguntinus  civis non atramento plumali canna neque aerea sed arte quadam perpulchra manu  Petri de Gernsheim  pueri mei feliciter effeci Finitum  an  MCCCCLXVI quarta die mensis sebruarii  Chevil  p  This present noble work  Tully's Offices  was done by  John Fust  citizen of  Mentz  not with pen and ink  c  but by a new art  c  by the hands of my boy  Peter de Gernsheim  ann  MCCCCLXVI  on the fourth of  February Several eminent writers as I have already hinted have esteem'd this the first printed book among whom is  Peter Ramus  or  de la Ramee  Royal professor of Mathematicks in the university of  Paris  who had this edition in his library and affirm'd it to be the first work  produc'd by the art of Printing  Cum primum  Typographiae  exemplum  Moguntiae  editum sit anno ut constat ex  Ciceronis Officiis  quae primum omnium librorum typis aeneis impressa sunt Exemplar  Officiorum  istorum habeo in membrana impressorum  P Ramus Schol Mathem lib    in this he has been follow'd by our countryman  Anth Wood  in the book before quoted by  Pasquier  in his  Recherches de la France  lib ch and by several others 'Tis very probable that the edition of and may be the same the last sheet only reprinted which may be easily known by comparing them together and it were to be wish'd that some of the Curioso's of  Oxford  would take that trouble since they are both there as appears from  Ant Wood  's list  AFTER the finishing of this book  Faust  is suppos'd to have died or lost his sight as some report or at least to have grown so rich that he left the business wholly to his soninlaw  Peter Schoeffer  who then instructed his son  John  in that art We find no more books printed in  Faust  's name all the rest being in  Peter Schoeffer  's some of whose inscriptions are given in the  fourth  chapter  I have dwelt somewhat longer upon these noble relicks of our first printers because I am sensible of the great value which the curious and learned have for them  I come now to those of other but fictitious dates which it will not be improper to say something of in order to prevent the reader from being deceiv'd or puzzled by them  AMONG all the apocryphal editions that are to be met within any library exclusive of those which are suppos'd to have been printed with wooden blocks and discours'd of already in a distinct chapter that which bears the oldest date is the Book of Sermons  de Sanctis  by  Leonard de Utino John Godfrey Olearius Lutheran  minister of St  Mary  's church at  Hall  in  Saxony  says it is still preserv'd in the library of that church and dated tho' there be no mention of the place where it was printed the reader will find his account of it quoted in the margin  Leonardus de Utino  ordin  praedic  Ejus  sermonum de Sanctis  liber sub ipsa  Typographicae  artis incunabula  anno  impressus absque tamen loci mentione habetur in bibliotheca templi  Mariani  nostri  Hall  Confer Dn parentis  Halygraph  Appendice T t t B Sermones ejusdem Quadragesimales Dominicales ann prodierunt  Abac patrolog  p  in his book de  Scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis  publish'd under the title of  Abacus Patrologicus  in  vo  at  Jena  in which he quotes the testimony of his father  Godfrey Olearius  who wrote the history of  Hall  printed at  Leipsick  in  to ann    Chevillier  observes very justly that  Olearius  hath mention'd neither the size nor printer of this ancient book and that all who have since spoken of it rely upon his testimony he thinks therefore that it ought to have been more nicely enquired into since if the date be true it entirely overturns the receiv'd opinion that this art was not perfected 'till the year the reasons of his suspecting it is because  Utinus  liv'd in  Italy ann  according to  Possevinus  and can hardly be suppos'd to have had such credit in  Germany  as that his sermons should be printed after a new method scarce known to above  five  or  six  persons he is therefore of opinion that the book is a manuscript or that  Olearius  has guess'd at the date or which is most likely that this is the date of the compiling not of the printing of it  MR  Mattaire  has taken the pains to solve the greatest part of these doubts and given the following account of it  Jam dabo tibi lector quod in votis habuit  Cheviliierus  unde editio tantae vetustatis specie venerabilis testimonio novo certior fiat notior Vir quidam literarum peritusdum Aquisgrani peregrinabatur ibi in  Regularium  coenobio vidit librum supra memoratum in  fol  ex quo descripsit haec quae in libri ipsius fine adjiciuntur

abbreviaturisque frequentibus adeo refertus ut ejus lectio nequaquam sit quam illorum  Moguntiae  annis excusorum facilior  Annal Typogr  p    "That a very curious and learned gentleman of his acquaintance met with a copy of it at  Aix la Chapelle  in a monastery of regular monks out of which he transcrib'd the following colophon printed at the end of it in  English  thus  Thus end the golden sermons upon the Saints throughout the whole year compil'd by Master  Leonard de Utino  doctor of divinity of the order of the fryars  Preachers at the instance and intreaty of the magnificent city of  Utino  and the noble citizens thereof  MCCCCXL VI  on the eve of our blessed father Dominick confessor to the praise and glory of almighty God and of the whole triumphant court  "  Mr  Mattaire  adds that the characters of it are very rude and ill shap'd and so full of abbreviations that they are as difficult to read as those printed at  Mentz ann  and  THIS makes it abundantly plain that tho' the book carries the abovemention'd date yet it bears testimony that the compiling and not the printing of it is there intended so that not only the difficulty disappears but  Chevillier's  conjecture is manifestly supported And Mr  Mattaire  seems entirely of this opinion and besides instances in a book or two which he hath whose dates as he assures us were those of their being compil'd tho' the obscurity of their inscription might possibly lead an unwary reader to take it for that of its impression and indeed it is an unreasonable supposition that Printing could have been brought to such a degree of perfection at that time against the general testimony of writers besides neither the abbreviations nor the rudeness of the character can be a sufficient index of their antiquity seeing as he observes they continued in use among some eminent Printers even beyond the year In the next place I shall mention some editions whose dates are certainly prov'd to be wrong The first is the  Regula Pastoris  of Pope  Gregory  a copy of which is in the  French  king's library with this inscription suppos'd to be written at the end  Tentamentum Fausti  an essay of  John Faust ann  now it is plain from what has been said before that  Faust  was so far from making any essays at that time that he had already printed several perfect editions Mr  Mattaire  gives us this account of it  p  that he met with a book in  to  in the king's library at  Paris  without the name of either place or Printer only with this title  Liber Regulae pastoralis  Gregorii  papae ad  Johannem  episcopum  Ravenensem at the beginning of which  Gabriel Naudé  had written two verses to the reader with his own hand intimating that book to have been certainly printed by  Faust  at  Mentz  because the mark of the paper which is the head and horns of  an heifer is an infallible criterium of  Faust  's books And an advertisement in which he confirms his assertion from the rudeness of the types the want of diphthongs and some other circumstances that favour the infancy of the art and concludes that  Faust  would not put his name  c  to it 'till his frequent essays had embolden'd him to make himself publick as he did afterwards in the  Durand  's  Rationale  of  Catholicon  c  MR  Mattaire  doth indeed prove plainly enough that the rudeness of the types and want of dates names  c  continued some considerable time after the discovery of the art and consequently that that could be no certain mark of its being one of  Faust  's first essays however as nothing certain can be affirm'd concerning this book we shall dwell no longer upon it I have seen  Aeneas Sylvius's  letters printed by  Koelhoff  of  Lubeck  which is certainly antedated for this reason several dates in the letters being ten years older than the date of the book itself There is another of his books in  fol  in the library of the  Sorbon  with a false date at the end of these words  Flores de diversis sermonibus epistolis  B Bernardi  per me  Joan Koelhoff  de  Lubeck  coloniensem civem impressi an  MCCCC  feliciter finiunt  for 'tis plain the art was not so much as thought of at that time nor perfected 'till years after but what demonstrates the falseness of the date is that this  John Koelhoff  was scarce born then since he printed the works of  N Gerson  in  vol  in  fol  at  Cologn ann  which are of the same make and character as the  Flores  abovemention'd as  Chevillier p  and observes who therefore thinks that the following numbers LXXXII were omitted at the end of MCCCC The same author mentions two or three editions more of the same nature the last of which is the  Manipulus Curatorum  of  Guy Mout Rocher  with the following uncommon date at the end  Completus  Parisiis  anno Domini millesimo CCCC vicesimo tertio amen  Chevil  p  Printed at  Paris  in the year one thousand  CCCC  and twenty three amen  'tis plain that the art was not brought to  Paris  'till the year as shall be shown in its place so that the last C must have been taken up by the balls or lost some other way Upon the whole it may be esteem'd a general rule that all dates before the year are false and this is corroborated with the suffrage of all learned writers upon this  subject In the mean time as it is not reasonable to imagine that  Faust  and  Schoeffer  could be altogether idle from the year in which they are suppos'd to have finish'd their first  Bible  to in which they publish'd the  Psalter  unless we can suppose that  Faust  's lawsuit with  Guttenbergh  and his journey and stay in  France  could take him up  five  whole years and that his ingenious son did not venture upon any work by himself if time and industry should as we may reasonably hope it may discover any more of those old and valuable monuments of the infancy of the art provided such impressions bear either a certain date or mark of their being done at  Mentz  and by our  Protodaedali  before the dispersion of their servants or even after that time I doubt not but the learned will allow them a proper rank in the lists which shall be publish'd hereafter  CHAP X Remarkable Occurrences between the year and the Divulgation of the  Art    THO' I propos'd to avoid all unnecessary repetitions yet this chapter being design'd as a short recapitulation of the history of the first  twelve  years the thread of which has been unavoidably interrupted by controversy and to introduce some material occurrences which could not properly be inserted in any other chapter or such as may have escap'd the readers memory I find the impossibility of joyning these notable events together without interspersing them with most of those already touched upon and this has render'd an apology before hand highly necessary  I begin with the year in which 'tis agreed by most authors that the art was perfected in theory and practice the inventors having prepar'd their tools and materials and made a great number of essays thinking they might with safety attempt some considerable volume Their next care was to carry on the business without danger of being discover'd to this end they admitted as few servants as possible into any part of the secret  and such only upon whose sidelity they might depend engaging them to the greatest secrecy by an oath This being done they allotted to them their several provinces but conceal'd every branch of Letterfounding and composing If my authority be required since all our accounts relating to these beginnings are so obscure and imperfect I answer that this may reasonably be infer'd from a remarkable passage out of the learned  Hen Pantaleon  a physician of  Basil  part of which I have already quoted in a former chapter as far as it related to  Faust  and  Schoeffer  's being the authors of this art the remainder of it is as follows  Erat enim ars illa primo abscondita pauculis manifestata litteras enim in sacculis clausis secum in Officinae ferebant ac dum abeunt auferebant donec temporis successu ars aucta atque plurimum illustrata fuit  Do illustribus German  part pag    "This art was at the first kept very secret and communicated to but very few for they  Faust  and  Schoeffer  tyed up the types in bags which they brought into the workroom and took away when they went out 'till at length in process of time the business increasing caus'd the Art to be divulg'd"  All the authors quoted by us agree with  Pantaleon  about their keeping the Art with all imaginable secrecy but scarce any have inform'd us of this circumstance of their carrying their types with them to and out of the workroom which would have been a vain precaution had they intrusted any but themselves in the compositor's part However it is evident that the whole secret did not consist therein the cutting the Punches sinking them into the Matrices making the Moulds and casting the Letters might be still a secret to any one that had been intrusted so far as to go through all the branches of the business of Printing and he must have been a person of a surprizing genius who could have found out the mystery of Letterfounding by barely seeing the letters therefore the keeping that part to themselves was making it a greater secret than all the oaths they could bind them with  THE next remarkable occurrence is that of their admitting  John Guttenbergh  a wealthy goldsmith into partnership with them as it is related by the last nam'd author by  Salmuth  and others quoted in the  third  chapter This gentleman finding his neighbour  Faust  engag'd in a new and advantagious invention which he wanted money to carry on and attracted  by a prospect of gain offer'd his purse and assistance upon good terms to  Faust  who gladly accepted the proposal But  Guttenbergh  pursuing his own private rather than the common interest and having attain'd some insight into the art began to object that  Faust  had converted some of the money to his own uses and refus'd the payment of his dividend of the charges 'till  Faust  had obtain'd a decree which oblig'd him to pay his moiety of what the plaintiff should swear had been expended upon the common fund this he evaded by giving a bond payable some time after and escaping to  Strasburgh  his native city before it was due But he first took care to learn as much of the art as he could to furnish himself with Printingtools and to draw off some of  Faust  's servants with him At  Strasburgh  he communicated to  John Mentel  or  Mentelin  the secret and his design of setting up a Printinghouse there however neither he nor his workmen were so throughly instructed in the business but they were oblig'd to demur a considerable time before they could perfect every thing for the work and to make many tryals in order to attain the right method which is evident from this that there is no book extant with  Mentel  's name 'till the year and not at all with  Guttenbergh  's for it is scarce probable that if they had printed any considerable volumes before that time they should all have perish'd without being so much as taken notice of by any author and especially by their learned townsman  Wimpheling  whilst there remain so many of  Faust  's in the writings and in the hands of the learned and curious During this time  Faust  finding himself impos'd upon by  Guttenbergh  and disappointed of the money expected and wanting either will o  power to sue him in that city where he fled form'd a strategem to raise himself a fresh supply which succeeded according to his wish for he went to  Paris  with some of his finest vellum  bibles  one of which was sold to the king for crowns and is still to be seen in the royal library at  Paris  a masterpiece in that kind another was bought by the Archbishop of  Paris  for crowns but as people were unwilling to give so exorbitant a price he offer'd some of the last for crowns and less in hopes to have dispos'd of them all before he was discover'd It is not indeed to be suppos'd that they were all equal in the ornamental part yet the beauty of the work  the elegancy of the flowerpieces initial letters  c  the variety of the finest colours intermix'd with gold and silver with which they were exquisitely variegated made the purchasers fond of shewing them to their acquaintance as every one thought the whole world could not produce such another 'Tis reported that the Archbishop thinking his  bible  worth his majesty's seeing carried it to him who view'd it with surprize and in return shew'd his own upon a stricter examination and comparing 'em together they found that the ornaments were not exactly the same but as to the other part suppos'd to be written they observ'd such a conformity in the number of pages lines words and even the letters as soon convinc'd them that they were done by some other method than transcribing besides two such  bibles  were the work of a man's lifetime to transcribe and upon enquiry he was found to have sold a much greater number Hereupon orders was given to apprehend  Faustus  and prosecute him as a  Conjurer  I should have been apt to think this charge too absurd to gain belief except among the vulgar and that it was only conniv'd at in hopes it would terrify him to a discovery of his art were it not for a passage which I have met with in Mr  Maichel  's history of the  Paris  libraries wherein he mentions a strange problem publish'd by Father  Bouhours  a learned Jesuit  Whether it be possible that  German  should be a wit  Mr  Maichel  justly takes the part of his countrymen and proves them much wiser for the invention of Printing than those stupid  Paris  doctors who rather believ'd it an effect of  Magick  than of human wit or invention  De la Caille  relates that he fled to  Mentz  and suspecting his safety there departed to  Strasburgh  where he taught  John Mentel  or  Mentelin  his Art but there is not the least probability for this assertion since he could not be safer at one place than at another and with respect to  Mentel  it is much more probable tha  he learn'd the invention from  Guttenbergh  than from  Faust  who perhaps was never at  Strasburgh  unless he pass'd thro' it in his journey to and from  France  HOWEVER the parliament of  Paris  thought fit to make an arrest in favour of him and to discharge him from all further prosecution in consideration of his noble invention and as I am credibly inform'd a salary was paid by that crown to  Faust  's descendants for many years after as a reward for his sufferings and merit this was the end and success of that  expedition and prov'd at length very advantagious to him and made some amends for the melancholy hours of his confinement and the terrors of an approaching death  FAUST discharg'd thus with honour and a large supply of money return'd to  Mentz  where being inform'd that his quondam partner  Guttenbergh  was endeavouring with the assistance of  Mentel  to set up a printinghouse at  Strasburgh  and to challenge to himself the whole glory of the invention he began to consider that it was not only in vain but even dangerous to conceal himself and his art any longer from the world and 'tis probable resolv'd at last to make both as publick as possibly he could in all the editions which came from his press 'till at least  ann  or in which he is suppos'd to have reprinted the last leaf of  Tully  's  Offices  the last book known to be printed by him During the interval between and the taking of  Mentz ann    Faust  meeting with prodigious encouragement was oblig'd to increase the number of his workmen and open more of the art to them than he had done 'till then Some of these having attain'd a sufficient insight into the mystery were induc'd to go somewhere else and set up for themselves to which they were encourag'd both by the example of those who went away with  Guttenbergh  and probably by invitations from other places which were desirous of having the Art brought to them  Pantaleon  tells us that some of those who signaliz'd themselves the first in  Italy  were of that number and indeed if we consider how soon they began to print in that kingdom especially  Rome Venice c  and make a just allowance for preparing the great apparatus of a Printinghouse with their first essays before they came to work off those volumes which are of the oldest date some of them pretty large we cannot but think that they left  Mentz  long before it was taken  Faust  however had a sufficient number of servants left to finish his last editions which are mention'd before after this we hear no more of him 'till the year wherein  Peter Schoeffer  and one  Henlif  a bookseller gave a book to a monastery in order to obtain the prayers of it for  Faust  's soul by which it was apparent he was dead before that time or perhaps before because  Schoeffer  in that year printed St  Jerom  's  Epistles  in his own name without any mention of his master  Faust  HERE therefore I am oblig'd to conclude the history of that  illustrious man  tho' I should have been vastly more satisfy'd in communicating other particulars of his life and death could I have found 'em in the writers of those times But  Germany  is not the only ungrateful country that has neglected such as have best deserv'd of her for the following books will furnish us with instances of this in other parts of the world I shall only observe that as it is the property of false desert to be solicitous for panegyricks and monumental records whilst true and intrinsick merit is silent and equally contemns both so whilst the  Dutch  bestow the highest encomiums upon a  suppositious and imaginary inventor  the  Germans  have been so regardless of a  true  and  real  one as to leave it entirely to his own works to transmit his praises to posterity If  Faust  had died before the sacking of  Mentz  we might have had grounds to suppose that some monument had been erected to his memory by his fellowcitizens and destroy'd by the conqueror but as he surviv'd those times at least  six  or  seven  years and carry'd on and improv'd the Art during that interval 'tis impossible to entertain so favourable an opinion of the  Moguntines  However his books and the art which he left us will more effectually and universally proclaim and perpetuate his name and memory than any monumental inscriptions  c  and endear both to the learned and curious as long as the Art or the world itself shall endure  THERE is one occurrence worthy to be mention'd which I omitted in this chapter not so much out of forgetfulness or neglect since it is an instance of  Faust  's gratitude and generosity as because it is not easy to fix the time of it nor so likely to have happen'd within the compass of these  ten  years as of some of the former  viz  between and That is his giving his only daughter in marriage to his servant  Peter Schoeffer  admitting him into partnership and procuring him the freedom of the city of  Mentz  as a reward for his services and the improvements which he made to the Art such as the invention of punches matrices metaltypes and as some report Printer's ink if these discoveries are owing to him  Faust  made him as ample amends as he could possibly I wish  Schoeffer  had been so grateful to his generous master as to have transmitted to us a fuller account of his life and character than what we enjoy or if he perform'd this that time had not depriv'd us  of so valuable a monument the want of which obliges me much against my will to bring this chapter and history to a conclusion and rest satisfy'd with what we have  CHAP XI The Conclusion with an Account of the antient Method of  Printing    I AM now come to the close of the first book of this history which I have endeavour'd to inrich with collections from dead and living authors and every thing valuable that I could procure upon this subject from many of the most curious libraries The next book will open a large and pleasant scene In the mean time I cannot conclude this better than by giving a short summary of the whole and digesting it into distinct periods that the reader may as it were at one view see the whole progress of the Art and fix it more easily in his memory and by closing it with an account of the old way of printing us'd during the time of  Faust  his soninlaw  c  THIS Art was devis'd a considerable time before any thing done that way appear'd  'TIS not improbable that the first hints of engraving upon woodenblocks might come from the  Chineses  who practis'd it above years before it was thought of in  Europe  THE attempts to imitate it began about the year and not before  THE new and more perfect method of Printing with fusiletypes did not succeed it 'till years after  viz    THIS new invention was discover'd by  John Faust  in the city of  Mentz  in the perfecting of which  Peter Schoeffer  assisted him very much and was amply rewarded by his master  JOHN GUTTENBERGH had no other share or merit in this discovery than by promoting it with supplies of money from time to time and that not from a principle of a publick spirit but for his own interest which made him drop both the Art and Artist when he found it less gainful than he expected  THIS invention was kept with all imaginable secrecy by these three parties 'till  Guttenbergh  upon a difference between them took some of their servants with him to  Strasburgh  where he began to practise it and to teach it to  John Mentel  The person in whose favour the  Strasburgh  pretensions were afterwards started  THIS contention not happening 'till the year they had already printed the  latin bible  and perhaps privately dispos'd of some number of the copies seeing their dispute was about stating their accounts and balancing the charges and profits of the business  WHETHER their first separate types were of wood or lead or any other metal they ventur'd to print their first essays but on one side of the page 'till they had found out a better ink than the common sort which they then us'd  IT is probable from this circumstance that their first improvement upon common ink to prevent its spreading was only by charging it with a proportionable quantity of some watery gum such as gum arabick mastick  c  which tho' it remedied that defect would not suffer the paper to be printed but upon one side but either  Schoeffer  or his master having found out the way of making it with oyl they then printed on both sides  THEY did not begin to put their names and inscriptions at the end of their books as we can yet find 'till the year this they continued to do 'till  Faust  either dyed or left off the business  GUTTENBERGH's name was never joyn'd with theirs nor put to of the books which he printed after he abandon'd  Faust  SOME others of  Faust  's servants forsook him before the taking of  Mentz  and settled some at  Cologn  others in  Italy  THE greatest dispersion of them was when that noble city was taken and plunder'd by Archbishop  Adolph ann  so that the Art became universally known throughout  Europe  THERE remains now only to give the reader an idea of the first way of Printing and of what is most peculiar to it which tho' a subject well known by the curious may not be unacceptable to several persons to whose hands this work may chance to fall  WITH respect to their forms they were generally either large or small  folio's  or at least  quarto's  the lesser sizes were not in use  THE leaves were without runningtitle directionword number of pages or divisions into paragraphs  THE character itself was a rude old  Gothic  mix'd with  Secretary  cast on purpose to imitate the handwriting of those times the words were printed so close to one another that it was difficult and tedious even to those who were us'd to MSS and to this method and often lead the inattentive reader into mistakes  THEIR orthography was various and often arbitrary and as for the diphthongs ae and oe they were not at all careful about them  THEY had very frequent abbreviations which in time grew so numerous and difficult to be understood that there was a necessity of writing a book to teach the manner of reading them  THEIR periods were distinguish'd by no other points than the double and single one  i e  the  colon  and  full stop  just after the same manner  as the reading  psalms  in our  Common prayerbooks  are pointed all other punctuations being of much later invention  THEY us'd no great letters to begin a sentence or proper name of men or places  THEY left blanks for the places of titles initial letters and other ornaments in order to have them supply'd by the illuminators whose ingenious art tho' in vogue before and at that time yet did not long survive the masterly improvements made by the printers in this branch of their Art Those ornaments were exquisitely fine and curiously variegated with the most beautiful colours and even with gold and silver the margins likewise were frequently charged with variety of figures of saints birds beasts monsters flowers c which had sometimes relation to the contents of the page tho' mostly none at all these embellishments were very costly but for those that could not afford a round price there were others done after a more ordinary manner and at much cheaper rates  THE names of the printer place c were either wholly neglected or put at the end of the book not without some pious ejaculation or doxology  THE date was likewise omitted or involv'd in some crampt circumstantial period or else printed either at full length or by numerical letters and sometimes partly one and partly the other thus  one thousand  CCCC and  sixty  c but all of them at the end of the book  THERE was no variety of characters no intermixture of  Roman  and  Italick  which were of later invention but their pages were continued in a  Gothick  letter of the same size throughout  THEIR  Rubricks  which were very frequent and added no small beauty to the pages were sometimes done by the same hands as the initial letters  WHENEVER they met with any  Greek  they either left a blank for it to be afterwards fill'd up by writing if the passage was long or if short consisting only of three or four words they got it cut on wood tho' after such a rude and illshap'd manner that it required some pause to be read  THE quotations of the places out of which they were taken were very often neglected both in Manuscripts and printed books which caus'd the curious no small trouble to find them out  THEY had seldom dedicatory or prefatory epistles and when they began afterwards to retail them in their impressions they generally plac'd 'em at the end of the work a piece of justice as much neglected as wanting in our age  THEY collected no  table  of  contents  no  index  nor  summary  which are indubitably a great help to the reader nor any  errata's  at the end for what faults were in their editions were rather owing to the manuscripts which they printed after than to the carelesness of the Printer  THEY printed but few copies at once for or were then esteem'd a large impression tho' upon the encouragements receiv'd from the learned they increas'd their numbers in proportion  LASTLY If I may be allow'd this article they were not solicitous to obtain  privileges  and  patents  for the sole printing of any particular volume tho' towards the later end of  Faust's  time several of his servants set up Printinghouses and were ambitious to excel their master How soon after those privileges began appears from that granted by the Emperor to  John Schoeffer Faust's  grandson  ann  for the sole printing  T Livius  and to prohibit any other to reprint those books which had come from his press and as this had been granted upon the account of his being the grandson of the first inventor of the Art so several Popes and Princes gave like patents to their first Printers as a mark of their favour  I shall here mention something concerning their way of Bookbinding an account of which we find in  Scaliger  Scaligeriana Hag edit in vo  p  who tells us that his grandmother had a printed Psalter the cover of which was two inches thick in the inside was a kind of cupboard wherein was a small silver crucifix and behind it the name of  Berenica Codronia de la Scala  This book seems to have been printed with wood but probably bound like the rest  AS to the prices of their books I cannot find any thing particular except what I have before quoted out of  Campanus's  dedication to the Pope from which it may be infer'd that in his time at  Rome  they were sold for about one fifth part of what the MSS had done To this I shall add an instance of the gift bequeath'd by  P Schoeffer  and  Conrad Henlif  of the same profession to a library of monks which will enable us to guess at the great rate they still were sold for  La Caille  relates it out of the annals of the abby of St  Victor  at  Paris  and it is as follows  Anniversarium honorabilium virorum  Petri Schoeffer    Conr  di He  lf  ac  Joan Fust  civium de  Moguntia  impressorum necnon uxorum filiorum parentum amicorum benefactorum qui  Petrus    Conradus  dederunt nobis  Epistolas beati Hieronymi  impressas in Pergameno excepta tamen summa duodecim scutorum auri quam praefati impressores receperunt per manus Domini  Joannis  Abbatis hujus ecclesiae  kalend Novemb  ann    De la Caille  pag    "The anniversary office for the souls of the honourable  Peter Schoeffer Conr Henlif  and  John Faust  citizens and Printers in the city of  Mentz  as also for the souls of their wives parents children friends and benefactors which said  P Schoeffer  and  C Henlif  have given us the book of St  Jerom's Epistles  printed upon vellum  in two vol fol ann  excepting nevertheless the sum of twelve golden crowns which the aforesaid Printers receiv'd from our Lord  John Abbot  of this church  Oct  "  HENCE 'tis plain that the  twelve crowns  which in those days were more than equivalent to as many  pounds  now were but part of the price or value of the said book and that the other part whatever proportion it bore to this was remitted to them in consideration of this anniversary office to which there us'd to be no price fix'd tho' the least for it was generally  five  or  six crowns  I conclude this chapter with an observation of Mons  de la Monoye  concerning the phrase of  Libri editi  which I hope the curious will be pleas'd with he tells us that this phrase was us'd before the invention of Printing  and signified only books publish'd and dispers'd abroad in some considerable number in opposition to those that were writ fair to be set up in libraries which were call'd  Libri scripti  This observation he proves from a passage out of  Philelphus  who speaking of his ten books of  latin odes  expresses himself as follows  Carminum libri editi quinque versuum quinque millibus nam alteri quinque qui tantundem versus complectentur partim scripti sunt non editi partim ne scripti quidem  i e  five books of the latin odes are already publish'd containing    verses the other five which will contain the same number are partly written not publish'd and partly still unwritten  he observes further that the first  five  books of odes were not sent to the press 'till the year when they were printed in  to  at  Brescia  besides the same  Philelphus  tells his reader in one of his epistles written  ann  that he design'd to publish all the ten books in that year  Libros decem hoc anno edere institui  which could not be understood of Printing seeing tho' the art was perfected about this time yet it was still kept secret 'till  four  years after when  Faust  put his first colophon to the Psalter Whether this observation be as certain as it is curious I shall leave to the judgment of my readers  CHAP XI An Account of the first printed  Bibles  before the year  AS those authors who have wrote any thing fully upon the subject of P  inting have given their readers an account of the first Bi  es  have been printed from the discovery of the Art to the year  or even beyond I thought our  English  readers would not be displeas'd to have a short abstract given them of those antient and valuable monuments of the art and I can't but think it will be more acceptable to have them all in one view than dispers'd as they would be were I to give them under their respective Printers who liv'd at a vast distance of time and place from one another especially considering that some famous cities and even universities as that of  Louvain  have not printed so much as one single Bible in all the interval between the year  and and even beyond whereas others for instance that of  Nurembergh  has produc'd at least in that time I shall place them according to the years in which they were printed and add such farther particulars concerning them as I have been able to meet with in those authors who have given us an account of them and such as my own observations have enabled me to collect from those noble libraries I have formerly mention'd  BY this the reader will be sufficiently appris'd that I intend to speak only of those which bear any certain date but as for those which are either printed without date or with a disputed one I shall just say so much of them as will let him see how little they are to be rely'd on and what reasons I have to pass them by I have I think already ventur'd to give the reader a rule how to judge of such works  viz  if their dates are before the year they must be suppos'd to have been wrong printed either designedly or by mistake the reader will find proofs sufficient of the former in our next book and the later is too well known to require any however in this later respect I shall give him an instance or two of it because it will be a kind of a key to rectify any other that may hereafter fall in his way  WE meet with an account of a  German  Bible still kept in the library of the city of  Ausburgh  affirm'd by  Hottinger  who saw it there to have been printed with fusile types  ann  but with this caveat however  ni fallor if I am not mistaken  as writing at some distance of time and place other authors have given it that of but as either of them preceded the time of the invention  Malinkrot  tells us that  Martin Zeiler  thought it 'twas only a manuscript version made  ann  but Mr  Beugben  doth not scruple to tell us in the preliminary discourse to his  Incunabula Typographiae  that they only misplac'd the two last figures of the date and printed instead of  Chevillier  mentions two more out of  Lipenius  whose dates are demonstrably false the one is a Bible printed at  Paris ann  and the other at  Lyons ann  whereas it is certain that Printing was not brought to  Paris  'till  twenty seven  years after the date of the first  viz ann  nor to  Lyons  'till  six  or  seven  years after that the same may be said of another printed at  Basil  and affirm'd by two booksellers of  Geneva  in the catalogue of their books to bear date  since 'tis plain that that city did not receive the Art 'till about if the reader therefore will take this rule with him to examine the time in which the Art was brought to any place which he will find in the following Book he will easily rectify any wrong date that may come in his way and as for those which do not mention the place or Printer's name he may safely rank them amongst the apocryphal ones and them which have no date at all but as the former have been taken notice of by all our annalists I shall be obliged so far as I am able to ascertain their respective dates as we go along  BEFORE I come to speak of those which bear a certain and indisputable date I must not omit the  first  printed by  Faust  and  Schoeffer  about or soon after and mention'd by  Trithemius  the  Colognian Chronicle  and some other authors as the first considerable work printed with fusile types by those two  Protodaedali  I have already given the reasons of its being printed without date or colophon which would have betrayed the discovery of their new Art and prevented  Faust  's selling it for MS but this however ought by no means to hinder us from giving it the first rank seeing the fact is so undeniably attested It is pity they have been long ago either destroy'd or buried in some private libraries where the most diligent searches have not as yet been able to find them out perhaps its being printed so like MS may be one reason why they are still lookt upon as such by the owners if any such there be for which reason I am still willing to hope that time may discover and bring some of them to light and that what has been said in this history and by authors of a much higher character will spur up some curious persons to make a more diligent search after so valuable a monument 'till when no farther account can be expected of it than what we have already given  THE next is that which I have ventur'd after other authors to call the second impression of the Bible printed at  Mentz  by the same worthy inventors  ann  and which is consequently the most antient we know extant in any library we have already given some account of it in a former chapter  p  and of the colophon printed at the end of it which we need not therefore repeat here as there are several copies of it here in  London  where I have seen them and elsewhere in  England  we need not  go to any foreign authors for an account of it it is printed in  fol  as indeed all their other works were For tho' I have follow'd  Peter Lambeck  's notion of the Psalters being printed in  to  because its size may be very much like that of a  quarto  yet if I may here venture to give my judgment of a book I have not seen I think I have sufficient grounds to believe that the first Printers had their paper made of all sizes and that the  five books  printed on Blocks of Wood already mention'd to be in the Earl of  Pembroke  's library would appear to any one like  quarto's  were it not that the signatures shew the contrary  THE next impression we meet with is one which Mr  Mattaire  gives us upon the authority of a learned friend of his who desires to have his name conceal'd and the want of whose date is supply'd by a colophon of three  latin  verses importing that it was printed in the  third  year of  Lewis  XI reign  i e ann  by the three  German  partners who brought the Art to  Paris  tho' there be no mention made of the place where it was printed vid  Annal Typogr  p and I am persuaded that Mr  Mattaire's  friend was mistaken in the first verse and I should not have given it a rank here nor even mention'd it were it not to prevent the reader's being puzzled with this account of it under the year or his supposing me guilty of an omission but as  Chevillier  gives us the same colophon printed at the end of the first  Paris  Bible by the same three partners with this variation however from the former that in the first verse instead of  Semi lustrum  it has  tribus lustris  that is instead of the  third  it imports the  thirteenth  year of that king's reign we may easily suppose that it was the first  Paris  Bible of and that this unknown gentleman might possibly be mistaken however the book being in  Queen'scollege  library in  Cambridge  it may be easily consulted  The next impression therefore to that of  Mentz  is that of  Ausburgh  in latin  Augusta Vindelicorum  printed by  John Bemler ann  in latin  fol  It is mention'd by  Martin Crusius Melchior Adamus  and after them by  Malinkrot Chevillier  seems indeed to think their testimony insufficient to ascertain so old a date but I cannot see any reason for it seeing it is four years more recent than the taking of the city of  Mentz  and the dispersion of  Faust's  servants besides the city of  Ausburgh  was so near  Mentz  and so considerable withal that it is no way improbable  but some one of them might go and settle there even sooner than the year  The  latin  Bible  fol  printed at  Reutlingen Reutlingae  a small town in  Germany  in the dutchy of  Wirtembergh ann  mention'd by  Hallevordius  Father  le Long De la Caille Chevillier  and others but more particularly by  John Saubert  in his catalogue of the  Norican  or  Nurembergh  library where he saw it the Printer of it was  John de Averbach  we have nothing else extant of him at least with his name  The  latin  Bible  fol  printed about  Mar  at  Rome  by  Conrard Sweynbeym  and  Arnold Pannariz  or  Pararaiz  as I have seen it printed in one of their books who were the first Printers that settled in that city it has a preface and at the end four  latin  distichs in praise of those two  Germans  and a small work or history of  Aristeas  and is translated by  Matthias Palmerius  the Printers tell Pope  Sextus  IV in the lists which they gave him of their works that they had printed copies of it concerning this Bible  Spondaeus  gives us the following account  we have  says he  the Bible printed at  Rome  in two very large volumes ingentibus voluminibus ann    in the house of the  Maximis  by two  Germans  named  Conrard Sweynheym  and  Arnold Pannartz  The  Italian  Bible translated by  Nicholaus Malherbis  in Italian  Malermi  a  Venetian  abbot of the order of the  Calmaldules  printed at  Venice ann    Calend Aug  in  fol  by  Vindelin de Spire  who with his brother  John  was the first who brought the Art of Printing unto that city  Chevillier  tells us he has seen it in the library of the  Mazarinecollege  at  Paris  in two volumes and that tho' the  imprimatur  doth not mention the Printer yet it is easy to guess at him by the  Italian  verses which  Squazafica  has put to that edition  Mr  Mattaire  mentions another  fol Italian  Bible printed in the same year of  Malhermi's  translation without Printer or places name Father  le Long  is the author he has taken it from  The  latin  Bible reprinted at  Mentz  by  Peter Schoeffer ann  on the eve of St  Matthias  the apostle  fol  the learned  Walton  editor of our  English  edition of the  Polyglot  thought this the first impression of the Bible and seem'd doubtful of what some authors had affirm'd that they had seen some more antient editions that that how much he was mistaken  the reader may judge by the foregoing ones this Bible has a colophon at the end not unlike those us'd by his master and himself in the former edition and some other of their works  Mr  Mattaire  after Father  le Long  mentions a  latin  impression  ann  without Printer or places name  Annal Typogr  p  The  latin  Bible  fol  printed at  Paris  by  Ulric Gering Martin Crantz  and  Michael Friburger  the first who set up a press in that city This Bible which  Chevillier  has seen in the library of the  Celestin  monks and has given us the colophon of importing its being printed in the th year of  Lewis  XI reign  i e ann  is the same which we suppose Mr  Mattaire's  friend did inform him to have been printed in the d year of that monarch  i e ann  we need not therefore repeat here what we said just before under that head Mr  Mattaire  however places this under the year  The  latin  Bible printed at  Nuremberg  in the same year in  fol  by  Anthony Koburger  or  Coburger  first Printer of that city in which library  J Saubert  tells us they have a copy still extant we have another in the publick library at  Oxford  Another

ones which are either without Printer or places name or both because such were only the wretched performances of a few who made it their business to reprint the editions of some of the most famous Printers of  Europe  whether of the Bible or of any other considerable work and to vend them underhand for the right ones this was an abuse which began very early to be complain'd of for no sooner had a  Froben Badius Aldus  or any other  great Printer publish'd a work which had cost him infinite pains to correct as well as great sums of money to purchase the best manuscripts but they pyrated them in such a shameful and incorrect manner that they could afford to sell them for less than half the price And as there wanted not sordid persons to encourage this vile practice and to prefer those maim'd performances to the more correct ones if they could but save money by them it often prov'd that the sale of a valuable edition was hinder'd to the great loss and discouragement of the Printer whilst the bad ones went off with ease this occasion'd them to complain of the abuse in their prefaces to their works and to appeal to the learned against such practices some of whom in particular  Erasmus  did not fail to write very sharply against those enemies to learning who were at length come up to such a degree of impudence as to counterfeit the names marks and rebus's of the famous Printers of which we shall have occasion to give an account hereafter In the mean time all their complaints and efforts proving ineffectual towards the suppressing such pyracies they were forc'd to have recourse to the higher powers and to employ the assistance of their learned patrons to obtain them patents and privileges for the sole printing of those works upon which they had bestow'd so much pains and cost but this more properly belongs to the next book to which I am now hastening  BOOK II The History of the Dispersion Progress and Improvements of PRINTING from to  The INTRODUCTION  HITHERTO we have seen the  Art of Printing  kept with the utmost secrecy by its inventors and confin'd to the city of  Mentz  till the fatal year of its being taken plunder'd and depriv'd of all its former rights and franchises as we have hinted already which occasion'd the dispersion of the greatest part of  Faust's  servants whom we must suppose by that time to have been very numerous these seeing the deplorable condition to which that noble city was reduc'd and the difficulty of carrying on the business any longer with that freedom and encouragement they had till then enjoy'd and being perhaps inclin'd enough of themselves to leave their masters to go settle in some of the most famous cities of  Europe  where they were sure to gain not only wealth and honour but the friendship of the learned immediately dispersed themselves and settled some in the neighbouring cities of  Cologn  and  Ausburgh  others went to  Rome Venice Paris c  where they soon met with all the encouragement they could wish this happen'd as we have hinted in the former book in the year So that  Faust  and  Schoeffer  had happily conceal'd the art from the rest of the world at least the space of  twelve  years from the time of its being perfected we must however except one of his servants  viz Nic Jenson  who if the date of his first book be true and genuine must have given his master the slip before that fatal period since we find this book finished at  Venice an  with great advantage and improvement we shall have occasion to enquire further into this man and his work in the sequel of this book however if we except this one single work we don't find any footsteps of the infant art being carry'd out of its nurse's arms duing those twelve years  BUT now we must consider it in a different view dispersing it self over divers nations patroniz'd by Popes and Kings and esteem'd a divine blessing to mankind It seems now to have left the city of  Mentz  where it yet shines there brighter than ever and at the same instant discovers it self at  Rome Venice Oxford  and  Paris  and in a space shorter than can be imagin'd becomes conspicuous over all  Europe  As there is so great a number and variety of events and remarkable occurrences which happen'd in several cities of  Europe  at the same time or immediately after one another with respect to the first printers who settled there the improvements made by them and the encouragement they receiv'd it will be absolutely impossible to dispose them in such an order as may give the reader at once a full view of them all without interrupting the series either with respect to time or place Thus for instance while we shew the transactions at  Rome  during the  two  or three first years  Venice Paris Oxford Cologn Milan c  will open new scenes to our view attracting our eyes towards them and oblige us to break the thread of one to begin with that of another which continual diversions would rather confound than instruct the reader and render the history confus'd and tedious Our best annalists and historians being sensible of this have follow'd a better method Father  Orlandi  in particular the latest that has wrote upon this subject hath taken that of  De la Caille  who proceeds with every city by it self from the time it is suppos'd to have receiv'd the art to the end of the century according to their fairest claim to priority in point of time and then goes on with  the next in order This method I have chose and given under the head of each city the names character and merit of each printer that has wrought there from the time of its receiving the art to the end of the year and pointed out the excellencies of those who have been eminent in this art either by the beauty of their types the elegance and correctness of their works the number of their editions or any improvements which they made By this means I hope the reader will clearly see the early progress of printing in every place if not at one view yet at least in such an order as more easily to form an idea not only of the printers and cities wherein they resided but likewise of the most considerable patrons for wealth learning c of that time to whose character and merit I have not failed to do justice throughout this whole work  I propos'd at first to have clos'd this history with the fifteenth century but when I came to consider that the most eminent printers to whom we owe many important improvements of this art such as  Aldus  at  Venice Amerbach  and  Froben  at  Basil Badius  at  Lyons  and  Paris  with many others did not begin to appear upon this stage till almost the close of it and that their merit was not discover'd till the beginning of the next I thought it an unpardonable injustice to them and my readers to curtail their history by too scrupulously adhering to my propos'd epocha and therefore have chosen to continue this history  twenty  years longer  i e  to and sometimes made an excursion beyond that time when ever any of those excellent masters have outliv'd it This has afforded me another agreeable opportunity  viz  of mentioning some others who did not enter the province of printing till after the fifteenth century  ANOTHER motive which induc'd me to continue this history years longer was that I found all the improvements that had been made to the art were made by that time  i e  by the year at least the foundation of them was so far lay'd before that year that whatever has been done since either with relation to the beauty of letter elegancy of impression variety of types printing in different languages especially in the eastern ones in different columns correctness and the like all these and many more had already been carry'd on to such a perfection before this time that it admitted but of small improvements to be made to it afterwards I have therefore thought it a much better period to close  this history with than that of where  Orlandi  concludes his this has given me an opportunity of mentioning not only the improvements themselves but likewise those glorious printers to whom we owe them However as it would swell this book too much to insert the names of all the printers that appear'd within those years they being too numerous and a great many of them deserving rather to be remember'd with shame than honour I have resolv'd to speak only of those who signaliz'd themselves either for some improvements they made to the art the beauty and correctness of their editions or any other merit they have been conspicuous for it is for that reason I have chosen to speak of them in a chapter by it self after I have clos'd the th century to which I shall also add in another chapter an account of the abuses which crept into the art from its promulgation to that there may be nothing wanting to make this history as compleat and instructing as possible  IT will be necessary to acquaint the reader that tho' we have follow'd the method of the best annalists in settling the priority of every city according to the date of the oldest extant work that was printed there which is certainly the surest way and least liable to mistakes yet it is more than probable that they might receive the art much sooner seeing some time must reasonably be allow'd for setting up a printinghouse and furnishing it with the necessary apparatus which in the infancy of the art was more difficult to procure for want of proper workmen acquainted with all the branches of such a tedious work for which less than a year or two could scarce suffice and because we are not absolutely sure that those editions which we give for their first were really so Mr  Mattaire  who has taken such pains to search the best libraries of  London Oxford Paris  c for those old monuments that he thought he had exhausted that subject has nevertheless post dated the claim and rank of several cities by some years if  Orlandi  may be credited who afterwards rectify'd them by the discovery of some older editions and who can tell what time may produce that may wholly invert our present order thus for instance some of the historians quoted in the last book tell us that  Strasburgh Cologn Francford  c receiv'd the art before any others yet as we have none of their works extant but such as were printed some years  after we have been oblig'd to give them a lower rank and place them after  Rome Paris Venice  c The reader may easily remember that  Guttenbergh  left  Mentz  and settled at  Strasburgh  some years before the taking of the former  i e  before  ann  and that he taught  John Mentel  the Art in the latter yet we meet with no edition done there of older date than  viz  the  Decretum Gratiani  printed by  Henry Egestein  Tho'  Cologn  receiv'd some of  Faust's  fugitive servants soon after his rupture with  Guttenbergh  yet the oldest edition there as yet known is the works of Pope  Leo  I printed What became of those impressions before that time is scarce worth our enquiring since the best of those which have been since publish'd are far inferior to those done in  Italy France  c in beauty of character elegancy of composition correctness and choice of MSS to print after while themselves proved indolent enough to neglect those improvements even after they had been made in other countries  HOWEVER 'tis probable they might have sufficient business in printing small books of devotion lives of saints and legends which according to the tast of those times and of that nation in particular were eagerly bought up and thumb'd over 'till scarce a leaf was left while the men of learning and politeness were more curious in laying up such only as were a credit not only to the author and Printer but to the Art it self But however that be I hope what I have said will sufficiently convince the reader how cautious we should be in fixing the epocha's and consequently the rank and claims of every city in this respect since we know not but the next diligent searcher may find matter enough to give this order a new turn  I have shown in the close of the last book to what a degree of perfection the Art of Printing was advanc'd even before the year and given there some account of that noble edition of  Nich Jenson  which is suppos'd to be done  ann  with the encomium which Mr  Mattaire  to whom we are beholden for the first account of it about  eight  years ago gives to that masterpiece of the Art since which I saw it at the Earl of  Pembroke  's What seems strange in that Printer is that from the time of this date to not one of his impressions is to be met with so that neither their beauty nor the esteem which they merited among the curious  have been able to preserve them unless they are still latent in some libraries 'till some accident brings them to light as happen'd to the  Decor Puellarum  'Tis unreasonable to suppose that a man who could in so short a time improve the Art to a degree equal to the best Printers of the next age and publish'd so many excellent volumes from to should have continued idle for  nine  or  ten  years  FOR this reason many learned persons are of opinion that the date of the book is wrong printed and that one of the X's was either carelessly or wilfully omitted or taken up by the balls but Mr  Mattaire  will by no means allow this supposition and gives his reasons against it But tho' I am partly of his opinion yet there are two reasons that induce me to differ from father  Orlandi  in allowing the preference to  Venice  before these last mention'd cities the first is that this impression of the  Decor Puellarum  doth not mention the place where it was done and therefore might as well have been printed in any other place as at  Venice  our annalists give no other reason for its being done there rather than any where else but that  Jenson  is found ten years after the date of it flourishing in that city for the space of another ten years but how to fill the chasm of the first ten is what they are at a great loss as we shall see by and by My second reason is that had this book been really printed at  Venice ann  it would have been absurd for the two  Spires  who did not settle th  e till about  ann  to  ve taken upon them in their first colophon  the title of the first persons who taught the city of  Venice  the art of printing or if they had I doubt not but  Jenson  would have taken care to have confuted such an assumption in some of his own works which he never did allowing therefore the date of this work to be genuine yet it would be too presumptive to build the claim of that city upon a book which for ought appears was not printed there  I have ven ur'd to say so much concerning this impression in this introduction because of its being dated one year before the time our second book begins so that it could not so properly be brought into the book itself without antedating of it by that one year for the sake of one impression Before Mr  Mattaire  gave us an account of it in his  Annal Typogr  most authors gave the city of  Rome  the preference to that of  Venice  by at least or years and with respect to the latter the two  Spires  were allow'd to have been the first Printers there according to the verses that are at the end of their first works this impression therefore doth at most prove  Jenson  to have began to print some where before those two brothers were settled at  Venice  What discoveries may be made hereafter which may perhaps invert the present order is what I am not concern'd about at present my business is to settle it now according to the best light I have been able to get I hope the reader will excuse me if the respect which I bear to those noble cities who gave the first encouragement to this infant Art hath made me somewhat prolix and what he may perhaps call over curious in settling this point of precedency for since it may be so easily settled and adjusted from authentic records it would have been an unpardonable omission in me to have neglected it seeing every one of those cities do still value themselves upon their rank and have taken all possible pains to find out all the old monuments that would both support and advance their respective claims  I know that some annalists in order to fill up the chasm of  nine  years have suppos'd that  Jenson  went from  Venice  to  Paris  where he taught the Art of Printing and set up some presses and instructed several who became eminent Printers But this is improbable on many accounts Because there are none of his works done at  Paris  Because his character is much finer than any us'd in  France  by the first Printers there Because he would have met with such encouragement there especially considering it was his native country that there had been no occasion to return to  Venice lastly  because if he had taught so many skilful workmen in the Art of which himself was then by far the greatest master it would have been unnecessary to send for the three partners out of  Germany  who did not however come to that city 'till about the year that is  six  or  seven  years after his suppos'd coming thither To this we may add that upon this supposition the Art must have been brought to  Paris  several years sooner than the most authentick records and the best writers allow which seems as improbable as it is difficult to assign a place where  Jenson  printed this work From all which allowing the date of the  Decor Puellarum  as no place is mention'd where it  was printed we are oblig'd for the reasons before mention'd to give the preference to  Rome  CHAP I The City of  Mentz  Monastery of  Subiaco  and the City of  Ausburgh    §  Faust  and  Schoeffer  continue to print at  Mentz  after the Dispersion of most of their Servants and the taking of that City  IF those cities which gave the earliest invitations and encouragements to the Art of Printing do so justly merit to be recorded in their respective ranks that of  Mentz  certainly deserves to be placed at the head of them upon two accounts because it was the mother and inventress of it and because it still continued to promote and cherish it after it had been reduc'd to a foreign yoke In the first book we consider'd her in the former view whilst she was the only one in the world that engross'd both the Art and Artists to herself but the conqueror's sword was the occasion of its being dispers'd through the most eminent cities of  Europe  'till this time the best of  Faust's  servants being tyed by an oath of secrecy and perhaps by some more powerful engagement had not dar'd to forsake their master and if some few had ventur'd to break through their engagements yet were they still so imperfectly acquainted with the Art that they never perform'd any work that could abide the test of time if we except  N Jenson  's but now as the city was depriv'd of its freedom and privileges it abolish'd the difference between master and servant citizen and foreigner they began to look upon themselves as free from all former ties and at liberty to accept of the invitations which they receiv'd from  England Italy France  c so that in the space of very few years there was scarce a metropolis or considerable city where there was not one or more Printinghouses set up several monasteries likewise began to entertain those fugitives very early as we shall show anon and wherever any of those workmen chanc'd to settle themselves they did not fail of meeting  with all the assistance and encouragement which the most eminent men either for power or learning could give them However as they cannot be suppos'd to have been all men of equal capacity and industry so we need not wonder if they did not signalize themselves every where alike but whilst one sort of them did in a short space improve the Art to a very considerable degree others of a more sluggish nature contented themselves with going on in their old way and some of them even from bad to worse  WE need not doubt but that  Faust  and  Schoeffer  during this sad interval were as much courted by other nations to leave  Mentz  and betake themselves to a place of greater tranquillity and in a more flourishing state but their love to their native city which had favour'd them so much in its prosperity prevail'd upon them to continue there and to carry on their business as before This is apparent from the list of their works given in the first book and the edition of the great  Bible  which they printed in this very year with that of  Tully  's  Offices three  years after gives ground to suppose that the merit of this invention procur'd them some particular regard and privilege from Archbishop  Adolph  as soon as it became known to him which might induce them to go on with the business as they had done formerly however if they printed nothing between the year and as we don't as yet find that they did we may reasonably suppose that the confusion in which the city then was might obstruct it for that time since we don't find such a length of time between any of their other works the truth is we have very few or no particulars concerning them except what we have given in the first book wherein I endeavour'd as well as I could to trace  Faust  's history to the end of his life All that we can add concerning  Peter Schoeffer  is that he continued printing several considerable volumes 'till the year which he then subscrib'd with his own name and to some of which towards the latter end of his life he added his coat of arms which might in all probability have been given to him either by the Archbishop or some crown'd head accordingly we find these words added to his colophons  Suis consignando scutis  that they were mark'd with his own arms He left a son  John Schoeffer  who became likewise an excellent Printer at  Mentz  but he must in all likelihood have been very  young when his father dy'd seeing we find nothing printed by him 'till  ann  when he acquainted his readers in the colophons to his first impressions that he was the son of  Peter Schoeffer  and grandson to  J Faust c  the first inventors of the Art and that himself was an excellent master of it and an eminent citizen  primarius civis  of the metropolis of  Mentz  but as this is beyond my propos'd epocha I shall say no more of him  I don't find any other Printer in the city of  Mentz  during  Peter Schoeffer  's life about we meet with one single work of no great consequence done there by one  Erhard Rewick  and between the year and there are about  fifteen  impressions printed there without any Printer's name and therefore are suppos'd to have been done by some of  Faust  's servants who dared not put their names to them whilst  Schoeffer  and his son liv'd  THO' I do not design to swell the following book with a list of the works done in every city it having been done by the indefatigable Mr  Mattaire  and father  Orlandi  but only to give my readers an account of the most eminent Printers that have signaliz'd themselves in any of them with the names and dates of the less considerable ones yet I hope the reader will forgive me if my respect for  P Schoeffer  whose works are so much valued by the curious as well for their antiquity as for their elegance correctness and those ornaments which he still caus'd the illuminators to bestow on them to the last induces me to subjoin a list of them they are as follows with their colophons  The edition of  Tho Aquinas  's  Secunda secundae  printed in  fol ann  with an inscription at the end to this purpose

him who is therefore suppos'd to have dy'd about this time  WE have now done with the city of  Mentz  whose fame in this respect seems to have been intirely confin'd to  Faust  's family and that no further than to his grandson  John Schoeffer  seeing nothing considerable was ever printed there by any other person except the travels of  Bernard Bredembach  Dean of  Mentz  into the  Holyland ann  by one  Erhard Rewick  a native of  Utrecht  whom we have just mention'd 'Tis now time to come to those places which show'd the earliest specimens of this Art and to give the best account we have of them  § The MONASTERY of SUBIACO  THE next place that we know of which signaliz'd it self in the Art of Printing is the monastery of  Subiaco  in  latin Monasterum Sublacense  in the territories of  Campania  in the kingdom of  Naples  and subject to the Pope the monks of which are of the  Benedictin  order and very rich having the lordship of no less than fourteen castles Here the Art was introduc'd so soon that in the year there was publish'd an edition of  Lactantius  's  Institutions  in  fol  so correct and elegant and in such a beautiful  Roman  character that nothing seems wanting but the  name of the Printer What is still more surprizing is that  Lactantius  's quotations from the  Greek  authors are printed in a very neat  Greek  letter and extremely like that which the first Printers of  Rome Conrard Sweynheym  and  Arnold Pannartz  became noted for This induc'd father  Orlandi  to think it was one of the first essays which those two  Germans  made in that convent before they went to  Rome  but this can by no means be allow'd because tho' the character be like theirs yet it appears by the  eight  first impressions which they printed at  Rome  that they had no  Greek  alphabet 'till  four  or  five  years after the date of this impression as we shall see in the next chapter the following colophon is at the end of it  In the year of our Lord MCCCCLXV and the second year of the pontificate of Pope  Paul II  in the XIII indiction and on the last day but one of the month of  October  in the venerable monastery of  Subiaco    THIS scarce and curious edition is mention'd by  Montfaucon  in his  Diarium Italicum  p  seq  who hath given it an earlier date  viz  but the mistake arises from the last figure's being imperfectly printed We know nothing of any other impression which came from that Monastery's press  § The CITY of AUSBURGH  THE next is the city of  Ausburgh  in  latin Augusta  one of the most opulent of the imperial cities in  Germany  in which the learned  John Bemler  set up a Printingpress about the year The only two books that are known to be printed by him are the  Latin Bible  in  fol  with this inscription    er  Joh Bemler  Augustae Vindelic ann  and his  translation of  Joh Nach  's summa praecipuorum capitum fidei christianae  out of  Latin  into  high Dutch  printed  ann  Whether he printed any books during that six years interval or was employed wholly in translating this last work is difficult to determine as well as whether he publish'd any thing after However there were  five  other eminent persons in that city who tho' they did not begin so soon as he yet printed  divers learned works most of them being either citizens or natives of  Ausburgh  might in all probability learn the Art from him  As we have little or nothing particular concerning them except their impressions we shall content our selves with giving their names character and the time in which they printed as far as we can discover it by their known works  AFTER the above nam'd  John Bemler  came  JOHN SHUSLER citizen of  Ausburgh  a very good Printer but whose works reach only from  ann  to  GONTER ZAINER  de Reutlingen  who printed from  ann  to we have but  eight  of his impressions  ANT SORGIUS citizen of  Ausburgh  from to we have but  four  of his editions  ERHARD RALDOLT of  Ausburgh  who after having printed some works at  Venice  with his partner  Bernard Pictor  'till the year or beyond return'd to his own native city and there set up a press about or before the year and continu'd printing 'till if not beyond however he was a very diligent Printer for those times seeing he printed in that short space  seven  books in  latin  THE  last  we find in this city is  John Schensperger  who printed a chronical work in  Latin  with cutts  fol ann  but whether any besides that is not as yet known  WE find likewise two or three  Dutch  books printed here without Printer's name and of no great consequence  CHAP II The first  Printers  at  Rome  their Patrons and Correctors Books printed by them c their Petition to the Pope The City of  Tours  The Town of  Reutlingen    SOON after  Ausburgh  had receiv'd the Art of Printing it was brought to  Rome  by two Germans  Conrard Sweynheim  and  Arnold Pannarts  who set up a printinghouse there  anno  the second year  of the pontificate of  Paul  II under the patronage of  John Andreas  Bishop of  Aleria  who was the Popes librarykeeper justly fam'd for his learning and generosity These printers assisted with that prelates purse did immediately prepare an elegant round  Roman  character and a sufficient quantity of the finest paper they invented likewise such variety of spaces as kept a beautiful distance between the words and made their impressions appear with the greatest neatness and exactness Their margins were broad and not only added a grace to the pages but rendered them likewise convenient for the writing of notes  c  and their ink was so excellent that it still looks as fresh as if newly printed In short they were persons who valu'd their credit and the honour of pleasing their patron more than riches and spar'd neither cost nor labour in order to make their impressions as beautiful and correct as possible which any one that has seen them will own with pleasure  I doubt not but the great acquaintance amongst the learned which their noble patron's friendship procur'd them might be a great means of their improving the art to such a degree seeing such persons were best able to discover the faults and inconveniences of the first printed books which these  Germans  might more easily rectify when they became acquainted with them These two partners settled themselves in the house of  Peter  and  Francis de Maximis  brothers and Roman knights where the Bishop of  Aleria  not only furnish'd them with the most valuable manuscripts out of the  Vatican  and other libraties but also prepar'd them himself corrected their proofs and prefix'd prefaces and dedications to their works in order to recommend them the more to the learned world This laborious task was follow'd by him with such application that he scarce allow'd himself time to sleep What a value this great Bishop had both for the art and these two great masters of it appears from his dedication to Pope  Paul  II prefix'd to the edition of St  Jerom  's  Epistles  which I shall now give the  English  reader a translation of  "It was says he in your days that among many other divine favours this blessing was bestow'd on the Christian world that every poor scholar can purchase for himself a library for a small sumthat those volumes which heretofore could scarce be bought for an hundred crowns may now be procur'd for less than twenty very well  printed and free from those faults with which manuscripts us'd to aboundfor such is the art of our printers and lettermakers that no antient or modern discovery is comparable to it Surely the  German  nation deserves our highest esteem for the invention of the most useful arts The wish of the noble and divine Cardinal  Cusa  is nowin your time accomplish'd who earnestly desir'd that this sacred art which then seem'd rising in  Germany  might be brought to  Rome  Your Pontificate glorious in every respect will be as immortal as learning it self In which this art was brought and laid at your Holiness's feetIt is my chief aim in this epistle to let posterity know that the art of printing and typemaking was brought to  Rome  under  Paul  II This blessing was certainly confer'd on us by our heavenly Shepherd that a book is now purchas'd for less than a binding formerly Receive then great generous and glorious Pontif the first volume of St  Jerom  graciouslyand take the excellent masters of this art  Conrard Sweynheym  and  Arnold Pannarts Germans  under your protection  c  "  THUS were these two printers caress'd and encourag'd by most of the men of letters and fortune at  Rome  and even by the Pope himself who frequently visited their Printinghouse and examin'd with admiration every branch of this new art which seem'd design'd to recover learning and restore that city to its antient lustre This excited them to approve themselves worthy of all that esteem which was shew'd them by publishing a vast number of elegant impressions some of which were so large that they could not be done without great labor and charges as will be evident from the list of their works which they presented to the Pope of which we shall give an account in its proper place  WHAT their first impression was whether  Cicero  's  Familiar Epistles  or St  Austin  's book  de Civitate Dei  is what authors can by no means agree about that the former was printed at  Rome ann  with a latin epigram at the end of which their names are at full length and on the following year a new edition of St  Austin  's book  Anno igitur eodem opus  Augustini de Civitate Dei  eruditissimum  Epistolas Hieronymi  disertissimas cum luminibus orationis tum viribus argumentorum instructas vulgaveruntAnno superiore  Tullianas  dederant  Epistolas  hoc dant  Hieronymianas  c  Annal Typograph  p  is plain beyond contradiction  the dispute therefore seems to be about an edition of it older by a year in which the Printer without either naming himself or the place in which it was done contents himself with this colophon in  latin  MCCCCLXVII  in the third year of Pope  Paul II  c  from which last words and the likeness of the character with the  Lactantius  printed at  Subiaco  and their first impressions at  Rome  they venture to affirm it to have been printed by them without deciding whether at  Rome  or any where else  Orlandi  the last writer upon the subject speaks of it as follows  p    Egli e ancora certissimo che il primo Libro il quale usci dalle stampe di  Roma  e sempre stato creduto dagli autori il Sant  Agostino de c  vitate Deo  il quale se bene non addita il luogo ove stampato ne il nome degl' Impressori tutta volta e di carettere tondo  Romano  stampato nel anno terzo di papa  Paolo  II e nel millesimo come si legge in detto libro  Orleand origin della Stamp  pag    "It is certain that the first work that came out of their press has been universally believ'd by authors to be St  Austin  's book  de civitate Dei  and tho' it mentions neither the name of the place or of the Printer yet being printed in a round Roman character and in the  third  year of  Paul  II  ann  as may be seen at the end of the said book"  it cannot but have been done by them but I think I have two material objections against it the  first  is that if they had printed it at  Rome  they would not have omitted it in their list to the Pope and if at  Subiaco  or any where else I cannot see how they could print the  Cicero  at  Rome  in the same year  Secondly  tho' the likeness of the character seems to carry some proof and inclin'd him to believe the edition of  Subiaco  to have been also done by them yet it is evident by what we hinted in the introduction that they were so far from being furnish'd with a  Greek  alphabet that their first works have all the  greek  done upon wood in a very inelegant manner and that whenever the quotation was above  three  or  four  words they left a blank space to be fill'd afterwards with the pen whereas this of  Lactantius  has all the  greek  quotations printed in a beautiful cast letter and therefore tho' we may allow this edition and that disputed one of St  Austin  's to have been done by the same hand yet it is plain it could not be done by those two  Germans  If we can believe them they'll tell us that they began their first tryal with a less considerable work  viz Donatus  's  grammar  of which they printed only copies this is plain both by their putting it at the head of their list and  by their prefacing it with the words  unde imprimendi initium sumpsimus  after which they went on with  Concerning these two editions the letter on which they were printed gave names to two sizes of  Printingletter viz  from  Cicero  's Epistles that siz'd Letter has been call'd  Cicero  ever since in  Italy France  and  Germany  and answers to our  Pica Holland  alone calls it  Medi  an  the other is from St  Austin  's book which is call'd  Augustin  in several parts of  Europe  but with us  English  but this I shall treat of more largely in the second volume  Cicero's Epistles  and the rest of their works without mentioning any edition of St  Austin  's before the year the epigram which we mention'd before to be at the end of both these editions is as follows  Hoc  Conradus  opus  Sweynheim  ordine miro  Arnoldusque  simul  Pannartz  una oede colendi  Gente Theotonica  Romae  expediere sodales  In domo  Petri de Maximis    I have already hinted their method of managing the  Greek  quotations which they follow'd in the first volumes they printed that is 'till the middle of the year perhaps were they forc'd to it for want of workmen to cut the  Greek  alphabet but at length notwithstanding the neglect of that tongue might have excus'd them from the labour and expence of procuring setts of punches and matrices for Printing in that language and the difficulty of finding workmen fit for such a task they surmounted every obstacle of this nature and form'd a compleat  Greek  alphabet which they us'd in the edition of  Aulus Gellius  Concerning this edition the Bishop of  Aleria  speaks thus  "However this prov'd a very arduous task at firstfor a great part of the  Latin  was corrupted thro' the negligence of the transcribers and a much greater part of the  Greek  deprav'd maim'd and mutilated Even that which remain'd entire was scarce understood by  Latin  scholars by reason of their ignorance in  Greek  Some attempts have been made by persons skill'd in both tongues to restore this jewell to its former lustre but they either discourag'd by the difficulty or diverted by other affairs desisted from the undertaking"  Thus writes that learned prelate who by the assistance of  Theodore Gaza  a man of great abilities and universal learning perform'd this admirable work rectify'd the  Latin  text and render'd the  Greek  intelligible This edition was printed  ann  in a fine character with the arguments to each book done in red by the illuminators  The quotations which are long and more frequent than in any other author are printed in a fair  Greek  character considering this kind of printing was but in its infancy and what is extremely remarkable they were so correctly printed that as we are assur'd by Mr  Mattaire  in two whole pages which contain'd seventy six lines of a considerable length there were but  fourteen  faults of impression The place mention'd by that author may be seen in  pag  of his  Annales Typogr▪  where he has set down those places which were wrong printed in order to convince the world by the smallness of their number of the accuracy and diligence of those two Printers  HE tells us likewise that their  Greek  character was somewhat large round and even without accents ligatures abbreviations or any thing that might perplex the reader except only that sometimes two or more words were join'd together without any space between them and that the periods had either no full stop or one in the wrong place so that a person not us'd to MSS was doubtful where the sense ended To this edition was prefix'd a dedicatory Epistle of the Bishop of  Aleria  to the Pope wherein he acknowledges the kindness of his Holiness and the Cardinal of  Ostia  in supplying him with money in his greatest exigencies and promises to proceed with the utmost industry in furnishing the learned world with new productions from the press At the end of the book is a copy of verses suppos'd to be written by the same prelate in praise of that edition which are elegant for those times the reader may find them at length in Mr  Mattaire's Annals  p I shall only give a  latin  octastich which was printed at the end of several of their impressions in commendation of the printers wherein the poet apologizes for the harshness of their  German  names offensive without doubt to an  Italian  ear They are inserted particularly in the first edition of St  Jerom  's  Epistles  and the great work of  Nich de Lyra  entitled  Glossa ordinaria in universam Bibliam  vol  fol  and in several others The reader will find them in the margin  Aspicis illustres lector quicunque libellos  Si cupis artificum nomina nosse lege  Alpera ridebis cognomina Teutona forsan  Mitiger ars Musis inscia verba virum  Conradus Sweynheim Arnoldus Pannartzque  magistri  Romae  impresserunt talia multa simul  Petrus  cum fratre  Francisco Maximus  ambo  Huic operiaptatam contribuere domum  Thus they continued printing without intermission  mission for seven years whilst their patron procur'd 'em all possible assistance and overlook'd their impressions This is manifest from the editions of  Tully  St  Jerom Livy Lucan  the works of St  Leo Ovid Nicholas de Lyra  and especially of  Pliny  with many more in which the Bishop acquaints the world with the pains taken by himself and his constant assistant  Theod Gaza  in correcting the originals and presiding over the editions  Juvit mirifice vir summae eruditionis ac sapientiae  Theodorus  meus  Gaza  atque ita quidem ut absque illo nec pene dixerim mundus hoc munus fuerit impleturus  Epist Dedic ad Pap  Paul II prefix'd to  Pliny  For this reason Dr  Mentel  mention'd in our first book affirms him to have been corrector of  Sweynheim's  press and  Campanus  Bishop of  Teramo  who was  Ulric Han's  patron to have perform'd the same office in his  Joannes Andreas  praesul  Aleriensis  qui in ipsorum libraria taberna  esse non dedignatus est ut nec  Campanus  in  Uldaric Mentel de vera Typograph origin  p  This is likewise asserted by  Naudé  in his supplement to the history of  Lewis  XI  Rome  fut une des premieres ou la presse roula par le moyen d'un  Uldaricus Gallus  qui dona sujet a l'eveque  Jo Campanus  lequel se rendit correcteur de son imprimere de composer cette epigramme a sa louange que raporte Faernus  Addit  ad Hist  Lud  XI p  and divers other writers But it is questionable whether those excellent persons can properly be call'd correctors or rather do not deserve the title of authors or editors  HOWEVER there is an eminent passage in this Epistle of the Bishop's before  Pliny's  works which as it demonstrates his care and diligence in his province ought not to be omitted  "It was says he  Irenaeus Lugdunensis  episcopus item  Justinus  ex philosopho martyr item cum divo  Hieronymo Eusebius Caesariensis  seram posteritatem adjurarunt ut eorum descripturi opera conserrent diligenter exemplaria solerti studio emendarent idem ego tum in caeteris libris tum maxime in  Plinto  ut fiat vehementer obsecro obtestor atque adjuro ne ad priora menda tenebras inextricabiles tanti sudoris opus relabatur  the earnest request of  Ireneus  Bp of  Lyons  and of  Justin  who of a philosopher became a martyr and likewise of St  Jerom  and  Eusebius  of  Cesarea  to the latest posterity that those who were to transcribe their works would diligently compare the copies of them and carefully correct them the same request I make now both with respect to other books and in particular to  Pliny  lest that work which cost so much labour and study for he spent above nine whole years in it should again sink into its former errors and inextricable darkness"  HITHER TO we have seen the flourishing state of this press which in the space of six or seven years at most  viz  from  ann  to oblig'd the world with no less than twelve thousand four hundred and seventy five volumes in eight and twenty editions some of them very large and all beautiful and correct so that if their vast labours and cost had met with suitable success they must have rais'd a prodigious estate But whatever be the cause 'tis certain that the greatest part of this library remain'd still in their hands for want of buyers which reduc'd them to the most necessitous circumstances Father  Orlandi  endeavours to account for this illsuccess by supposing that their impressions being in Roman character were dislik'd in those days because the learned had been so accustom'd to the old Gothick as not to approve of this new tho' preferable one This conjecture seems the more probable upon two accounts Because several eminent printers were oblig'd to comply with the tast of the age and use the old character resembling that of MSS Most of the first Printers of  Paris Venice Rome  c who began with the Roman were forc'd by degrees to resume the old Gothick which continu'd till almost the middle of the next century and prov'd the ruin of many valuable impressions in divers parts of  Europe  However that be our two  Germans  under these pressing exigencies had recourse to their great patron who immediately drew up a petition in their names and behalf to Pope  Xystus  IV subjoin'd to the fifth volume of  Nich de Lyra  's  Gloss  and presented on the th of  March  In this he represents their great merit and misery in the most pathetick terms imaginable gives a catalogue of all the volumes printed by them the greatest part of which was still unsold prays his Holiness to consider their deplorable case and declares their readiness to deliver up the unsold books either to him or to whomsoever he should command for their present subsistance The Bishop to shew that he was sensibly touch'd with their misfortune prefaceth the petition in his own name and requests the Pope to hear the just complaint of his worthy and industrious Printers and afterwards exposes their circumstances in their own words As this curious piece has never yet that I know of been translated into  English  I presume the reader will be pleas'd to see it with the promis'd list of their works both which they printed with the  works  N de Lyra Chevillier  tells us he saw it at the beginning of  Tome  of that great work It is as follows  "  JO AND  ad  XYST IV

March  xx  ann  MCCCCLXXII and in the first year of your most gracious pontificate"  THUS were these indigent persons oblig'd to expose their misery to the world with what success I cannot learn tho' it is evident from their printing a considerable time after as shall be shewn that some method must have been taken to extricate them from those wretched circumstances  Sweynheim  indeed publish'd nothing after the year and for that reason is suppos'd by some to have dy'd about that time yet his partner  Pannartz  continu'd printing till  ann  in a smaller character than what was us'd by him in company with the former It will not perhaps be amiss to remark that the word  quinternio  in the petition translated by us  Quirebooks  signifies a quire of five sheets so impos'd that they are put into one another by the bookbinder and the  first  sheet contains the  first  and  last  of the leaves the  second  the d and th  c  this method oblig'd 'em to compose  twenty  whole pages of matter before they work'd it off at press and requir'd a prodigious quantity of letter to every Font All the editions of these two partners as yet known from their first settlement at  Rome ann  to in which  Sweynheim  is thought to have dy'd are in number all folio's and in  latin  some of them pretty considerable such were their Bible of mention'd in the former book in two large volumes and  Nicol de Lyra  in five larger ones the works of Pope  Leo  sirnam'd the Great  c  As for those which  Pannartz  printed afterwards by himself we have not been able to discover above six all  latin  folio's but none so considerable as the three  last named he began to use the  Registrum Chartarum  which is the signatures plac'd at the end of the book thus A B C D  c  and so on for as many sheets as the book contains in his edition of  Herodotus  translated by  Laurent Valla  and printed  ann  his latter works are done in a very elegant character the last of which is the  Quaestiones de Veritate  of  ThomAquinas  It must be observ'd that many of these editions are printed without date and sometimes without their names but most of them have one or the other of the Epigrams mention'd before  viz Hoc Conradus opus  c or  Aspicis illustres  c but oftener the latter  THESE are all the particulars I could meet with concerning these two Printers The next in rank is  ULDRIC HAN ann  MCCCCLXVIII  ULDRIC HAN is commonly call'd in  Latin Gallus  in  Italian Gallo  and in  French Coq  which signifies a  Cock  for every writer upon this subject has thought fit to translate his name into that language in which he wrote This Printer came and set up a Printingpress at  Rome  within a very short space after  Sweynheim  and  Pannartz  He was a person so accomplish'd in his art that several nations have claim'd him and in particular the  Germans  and  French  These latter grounded their pretences upon the following authority  Anthony Campanus  bishop of  Terumo  the most distinguish'd poet and orator of his time perform'd the same office to him which the bishop of  Aleria  did to the two  Germans viz  of preparing and correcting his copies revising his editions and writing epistles and commendatory verses upon them He observing that  Han  had latiniz'd his name and subscrib'd one or two of his impressions  Uldaricus Gallus  particularly the edition of the universal history of  Rodoricus Santius  a  Spaniard  whom Pope  Paul  II made governour of the castle of St  Angelo  and bishop of  Palentino  took occasion to mistake his name willfully for he could not possibly be ignorant of his being a  German  and to represent him as a  Frenchman  not so much out of respect to that nation above the  Germans  as for the sake of a pun in his epigram which you will find in the margin  Anser  Ta  p  i  custos Jovis unde quo  n  is  Constreperes  decidit▪    Uldricus Gallus  ne quem poscantur in usum  ocui  pennis nil opus esse tuis  The witticism consists chiefly in this  that the  Gauls  or  French  being discover'd by the noise of the geese one night in their attempt to surprize the  Roman  Capitol a countryman of theirs had found out a way to be reveng'd of them by teaching the world an art of writing without the help of their quills These verses are annex'd to an edition of  T Livy  by  U Han  without date and quoted by several authors  MICH FERNUS in his life of that Bishop tells us that he learn'd this epigram of a  Turk  whom he met with in a journey to the Pope's territories and who gave him account of his conversion to the christian religion and his early love of eloquence which induc'd him to leave  Turky  and come to  Rome  to see the famous  Paul  II and  Campanus  whose works he had carefully collected and amongst other things recited this epigram However 'tis evident that he was a  German  by his adding the name of his country to that of  Gallus  in several of his editions Thus in that of  Cicero de Oratore ann  he calls himself  Ulricum Gallum de Wienâ  in St  Austin de civitate Dei ann    Ulricum Gallum Almanum  in some others  Ulricum Gallum de Bienna    de Ingolstat Wimpheling  undertook to prove him a  German  against  Fernus  who in his life of  Campanus  chang'd  Gallus  into  Gallicus  to make him an absolute  Frenchman  and ascrib'd this mistake to his having translated his name into  latin  which as  Hermolaus Barbarus  asserts ought never to be done But in this he did no more than what was frequent among the  Germans  and others who to soften the harshness of their sirnames either alter'd or latiniz'd them so  Fust  chang'd his into  Faustus Schoeffer  into  Opilio Leichtenstein  into  Levi lapis des Rouges  into  de Rubeis  and the learned  Stephens  into  Stephanus  which custom still prevails in foreign parts and the famous Mons  le Clerc  of  Amsterdam  stiles himself  Joan Clericus  in all his  latin  works To return to  Ulric IIan  THE time of his first coming to  Rome  is not easily determin'd Some affirm that he was settled there before  Sweynheim  and  Pannartz  as  Wimpheling Mons Naude  and Dr  Mentel  but this seems improbable upon two accounts Because we have no edition of his so ancient as those of the two last nam'd Because the Bp of  Aleria  who was the editor of all the first impressions of these determines in their favour and his testimony is of much greater weight in this case than that of  those writers He attributes  the honour to  Sweynheim  c of having founded the first Printinghouse at  Rome  and brought the Art from  Germany  in the preceding Popes reign and by their example encourag'd others to do the like  as he speaks in the petition to  Xystus  IV above quoted Now  Xystus  's predecessor was  Paul  II who was advanc'd to that dignity in  August  and in his days they came to  Rome  If  Campanus  the patron of  Ulric  had known of his settling there before them he would certainly have contradicted the Bp of  Aleria  and maintain'd the priority to the man who under his protection prov'd so indefatigable in his business that himself was engag'd night and day in revising his works  Cum  Uldricus  quidam  Gall  qui formas in urbein literarias nuper intulisset illum interquiescere assiduis emen ationibus non permitteret remque literariam ex magnis dissicultatibus inopiaque ad ingentem ubertatem gloriosissimo illo divino opificio evocaret  c Fern in Vita Campani  The merit of this Printer appears from his fine impressions and the choice that his patron made of him to publish those works which he had procur'd and corrected with the utmost application as well as from the praises which he gives him in his prefatory epistles and verses We find by the list of his books that he frequently neglected the date of the impression and his own name The former defect is supplied as far as possible from some material circumstances either in the epistles affix'd to them or elsewhere in the book and the latter by a diligent comparing of one edition with another for there is some peculiar difference between the characters of the first Printers by which a nice observer may judge of the author  THUS Mr  Mattaire  remarks that the types of  Con Sweynheim  and  Arn Pannartz  were easily known by their having a long  s  at the end of words the  i  without a point and no diphthongs those of  Nic Jenson  were much more round and neat with the diphthongs ae and oe whereas  Jo Spires  made use of e for ae and  Ulric Han  uses a single  e  instead of a diphthong  ABOUT  Han  took  Simon Nicolai de Luca  into partnership with him till the end of the year after which he printed by himself till There was also a brother of his call'd  Lupus Han  whose name stands alone in some of those impressions which are nevertheless allow'd to be  Ulric's  by reason of the likeness of the character  c  and added to the list of his works by the two latest annalists Mr  Maittaire  and Father  Orlandi  He affected to put at the end of some of his editions the colophon of  John Faust  and  Peter Schoeffer Non atramento plumali calamo  c  i e  that it was not done with pen ink or any other writing instrument  c  ANN he began to print a register in two columns at the end of his  Virgil  all his other editions as yet known are in number the first of which is  Cicero de Oratore  in books  ann  the last  Til  Livy  in  Italian  this last is in three volumes  fol  the d of which has an error in its date where they have printed instead of This work has not indeed his name but those who have seen it make no doubt but it was printed by him  THE two  Germans  had reason to tell the Pope in their petition that their example had encourag'd many more Printers to come and settle at  Rome  seeing we find no less than  thirteen  who practis'd the same Art there between and besides the brother of  Uldric Han  and his partner  Simon de Luca  and  eight  or  nine  of whom were actually settled there within a few years after the two former but as we have nothing left particularly concerning them except their names and their works we shall just mention them as they came in course of time  GEORGE LAVFR  de Herbipoli    alias Wortsburg  he wrought in the Monastery of St  Eusebius  at  Rome  as we find by an epigram of eight verses in  latin  rhyme written as is suppos'd by his corrector  Celestine Pulverinus  and printed at the end of his edition of  Tractatus de Institutione simplicium Confessorum ann  he had a partner some space of the time  viz Leonard Pelugi  we have but  five  editions of his the  first  is that of St  Chrysostom  's homilies translated into  latin  by  Fr Aretine sol ann  the  last  is  Durandi Speculum ann  he had another corrector nam'd  Pomponius  ADAM ROT he us'd likewise  Faust  's colophon and in the first of the two editions we have of him styles himself  Clericus Metens Dioces  his last edi  ion is dated  JOHN PHILIP  de Lignamine  he was a native of  Messina  and a  Sicilian  knight and intimate with Pope  Sixtus  IV to whom he inscrib'd a book of his writing  De unoquoque Cibo Potu utili homini nocivo eorum primis qualitalibus Malinkrot  mentions him  pag  upon the authority of  Simler  which last affirms him to have printed the following works at  Rome viz Quintilian Suetonius  the works of St  Leo Lactantius  St  Ambrose Tully's Offices Laur Valla  's  Elegantiae  and  Horatii opuscula  but we find none of these editions in the list of his works but only four less considerable ones the  three  first in  Italian  and the last  Eusebius  's history translated into  Latin  by  Rufinus  and printed  ann    STEPHEN PLANCK of  Padua  we have  eight  editions of his the last of which is dated  GEORGE SACHEL  de Reichenhalt  his last edition of  three  is dated  JOHN REYNARD  de Eningen  we have but one edition of his printed at  Rome ann  years after which we find him printing at  Strasburgh  JOHN  de Nicolao Haneymar de Openheim  JOHN SCHUSENER  de Bopardia    we have but two editions of theirs both dated  JOHN TIBULL  de Amidanis Cremonese  the two editions we have of his bear the same date  EUCHARIUS SILBER OF WIRTZBURGH  THIS  Silber  alias  Franck  a  German  and native of  Wirtzburgh  signaliz'd himself at  Rome  by the fineness of his letter which were of the  Venetian  sort He set up his Printinghouse in  Campo di Fiore  and not only translated his name  Silber Silver  into  latin  but likewise into  greek  so that some of his editions are subscrib'd  Achirion  and  Argyrion  others  Argenteus  added to that of  Franck  The works we have of his are  twenty one  in number from  ann  to however he continued printing there many years after but either the greatest part of these last have been lost or else he printed but little since we meet only with two editions of his from to in Mr  Mattaire  's annals  HIS correctors were  Michael Fern  sirnam'd  Archipoeta Bartholomeus Salicetus  and  Ludovicus Regii  the first of whom collected with prodigious industry all bishop  Campanus  's works which he caus'd to be printed in two different places within  six  months of each other  viz  at  Venice  and  Rome  in the order in which he had digested them These impressions were printed so incorrectly that he was oblig'd to insert an  Errata  in  Silber  's edition wherein he expresses a vast deal of indignation that a work in which he had labour'd so much should yet be publish'd so full of faults and gives it the following title  Vis ex stulto demens idemque ex demente insanus fieri Libros  Romae  primus imprime Corruptorum recognitio  After this he proceeds to the  Errata  with an acknowledgement of his own errors and endeavours to clear the Printers of others He shows the care which he had taken to render the edition correct but that his efforts were frustrated by the carelessness of the Printers who being tir'd with a days labour correct their proofs imperfectly and frequently neglect or omit the author's corrections  IN the sequel of this history we shall have occasion to mention some  Errata's  of a much greater length than the foregoing which  Fern  complains so loudly of tho' this contain'd four large pages in  fol  The two last Printers in this city before are  SIMON  de Nicolo  of  Luca  who had been sometime partner to the fam'd  Uldric Han  and of whom we have but one edition And  PETER  de Turre ann  in which year he printed  Ptolemy  's  Cosmography  in a large  folio  with maps and cutts and in a beautiful character  Orland  p which is all that we have of his We find about twenty more editions without Printer's names however the reader will easily see by this list of Printers and the scarcity of their works that the Art began to dwindle very much before the close of the century and if he consults Mr  Mattaire  upon the next he will find it still much thinner of both but whether for want of encouragement or what other cause is not my business to enquire  § The City of  Tours    TOURS is an Archiepiscopal city of  France  in which we meet with but one book printed This 'tho done in an old  Gothick  character which was not as yet us'd in any place but  Mentz  is so elegant that it may be esteem'd a masterpiece of that kind 'Tis to be regretted that the Printer of such an excellent work should be unknown The impression was done in the Archbishop's palace but if the reader upon that account shall expect it to be a piece of devotion he will be vastly mistaken for it is not unusual with ecclesiasticks of the most elevated stations in that church to have a greater relish for gallantry than religion The book is the loves of  Camillus  and  Emilia  to which is subjoin'd another upon the same subject translated from  Boccacio  by  Aretin  and is inscrib'd as follows  FRANCISCI FLORII  Florentini  de Amore  Camilli    Aemiliae  liber  expletus est Turonis editus in domo Guillelmi Archiepiscopi Turonensis anno millesimo quadringentesimo sexagesimo septimo pridie calendas Januarii  to De duobus Amantibus Libellus in latinum ex  Boccacio  transfiguratus per  Leonardum Aretinum  This book is join'd to the former and printed in the same character and form  THE following book was printed in the same city a long time after▪  viz  La vie miracles de monseigneur St  Martin  translatee de Latin en Francois  imprimee par Mathieu Lateron fol me de May Tours    N B  Tho' we design to treat in a distinct book of the introduction and progress of Printing in  England  yet it is not amiss to remark here that  Oxford  comes next in course to the city of  Tours  according to our premis'd criterion of the oldest editions for the most ancient impression printed in that university is St  Jerome's  exposition of the apostles creed to bearing date  ann a copy of which is now in the Earl of  Pembroke  's library  § The Town of  Reutlingen    THIS town of  Reutlingen  and the city of  Venice  are next the former of which being nearer to  Mentz  may so far be allow'd the first rank It is a small town in the dutchy of  Wirtembergh  in which  John de Averbach  set up a Printinghouse  ann  and publish'd the two following editions  BIBLIA Latina  fol  per  Johannem de Averbach    ALVARI Pelagii Hispani ordin min summa de planctu ecclesiae Christianae  Reutlingae    THIS is a very scarce book and has not the Printer's name but is nevertheless suppos'd to have been printed by  Averbach  It is in  fol  and the next edition of it was printed at  Ulm  ann This  John Averbach  must not be confounded with the learned  J Amerbach  of  Basil  of whom we shall speak in its proper place  CHAP III The City of  Venice  the Names Character c of the Printers who flourish'd in this City from  ann  to  Aldus Manutius  's Time    AS the city of  Venice  has excelled all others not only in the number of workmen and editions but likewise in the goodness and excellency of them I shall be forc'd to divide it into two chapters in the first of which I shall speak of those Printers who flourish'd from its first settlement there by  John  and  Vindelin de Spira  to the time of the great  Aldus Manutius  whose merit alone will very well deserve to be spoken of in a chapter by it self tho' there were no others to bear him company in it  WITH respect to those first Printers 'twill be superfluous to repeat here what I have said in the introduction of this book concerning  Nich Jenson  and the reasons for suspending my judgment concerning his edition of and allowing the priority to the foregoing cities before that of  Venice  There will be further occasion of speaking of that Printer when we shall come to thoseother works of his printed between the years and In the mean time I beg leave to remind the reader of the remark upon this head which we just hinted in the introduction  viz  that the verses at the end of the first impression by  John  and  Windelin  of  Spire ann  evidently prove them to have been the first who brought the Art to that city The reader will find them in the margin  Primus in Adriaca formis impressit aenis  Urbe libros  Spira  genitus de stirpe  Johannes  In reliquis sit quanta vides spes lector habenda  Quam labor hic primus calami superaverit artem MCCCCLXVIIII  Mr  Mattaire  who hath a particular regard for his countryman  Jenson  and first discover'd to the world the edition in dispute very justly intimates that there was such an emulation among the first Printers that they made no scruple of claiming the priority from each other right or wrong either by false dates as we hinted before or by pompous verses annex'd to their works from which he infers a probability that these two brothers might do so whereas  Jenson  in his opinion was too modest to have been guilty of such a piece of arrogance For my part I can't see any necessity of accusing either side of such a fault seeing they never charg'd each other with it besides  Jenson  in all probability printed his book somewhere else and therefore might indeed be too modest when he came to  Venice  to challenge the priority from them as to that place in particular However as to the point of modesty I own I am at a loss to what side to give it seeing all the first impressions both of  Jenson  and of the two brothers are back'd with epigrams equally magnificent and I don't see where there would have been the least immodesty in either to have ascertain'd a just claim against an unjust assuming rival Let me add that if there was any wilfull mistake on either side which I think there was not it is more probable  Jenson  should have committed it than the two brothers because he might easily if there was occasion excuse it by making his date pass for an error of impression whereas the two  Germans  publish'd themselves in words at length and  in the plainest terms the first Printers at  Venice  and so left no room for evasion I shall therefore begin with them who were not inferior to  Jenson  himself  JOHN and VINDELINE of SPIRE  THEY were natives of  Germany  but whether of the city of  Spire  whose name they bear or whether that was only their sirname I cannot determine for tho' some of the epigrams annex'd to their books seem to imply the former yet it is difficult to affirm certainly that it was not a poetical licence which in this case might have been more excusable than that of  Campanus  upon  Ulric Han  mention'd in the preceding chapter However 'tis plain that many of the  German  Printers had no other sirnames than those of the places wherein they were born  THESE two brothers soon surpass'd all their predecessors in the beauty and neatness of their characters and the elegance of their impressions which to this time render them admir'd and esteem'd by the curious above all other ancient editions  Venice  by this gain'd so much reputation for the fineness of her types that some eminent Printers at  Rome  and elsewhere either furnish'd themselves with setts of them or endeavour'd to imitate them acquainting their readers in their next impressions that they were printed  characteribus Venetianis  with  Venetian  types  Chevillier  indeed thinks this to have been an imposition upon the world nor can it be denied but that some of them pretended this in order to recommend their own wretched performances But this demonstrates the superior merit of that city and the laudable emulation of her Printers not only to excell those of other places but even one another And indeed these two brothers with  John de Cologn  and  N Jenson  seem to have brought the Art to its utmost perfection because none of the most famous Printers which succeeded till our time such as  Vascosan  the  Stephens  's c have surpass'd them in this respect as well as because this like other arts seem'd obnoxious to a certain fatality and decline when carried to a particular height as it happen'd in the space of  six  or  seven  years after their first settlement at  Venice  What I mean is that they should so unaccountably suffer themselves to be carry'd away by the degenerate  taste of that age and change their beautiful Roman character for the old obsolete and disagreeable Gothick which they began to print with about the year  THE  Spires  had the two following learned men for their correctors  viz Christopher Berardus  of  Pisauro  and  George Alexandrinus John  the elder brother is reported to be the first who put the directionword at the end of the page and that upon good grounds since no book to our knowledge before his  Tacitus  hath it the singular use of which is too obvious to want explanation He liv'd no longer than to the year and was succeeded in the whole business by  Windelin  who manag'd it with great applause by himself 'till in which year he took  John de Cologn  into partnership with him We find but one book  viz Plautus  printed by them joyntly so that it is probable each of them return'd soon after to his separate press This  Windelin  was so highly esteem'd as a Printer even by his own countrymen a thing very uncommon that he was twice invited into  Germany  by some eminent counsellors at law of that nation to print there the following considerable volumes  viz    Bartholi commentarium juridicum  which he perform'd  ann  without the name of the place adding only two verses inserted in the margin  Hos  Windelinus  clara virtute magister Transcripsit celeri formula pressa pede  Mait  aire Annal Typogr  p sub not b  and The commentaries upon the five books of  Decretals  of  Nic Tudeschi  of  Sicily  sirnam'd  Abbas Panormitanus ann    Vita Orlandi  pag  he printed likewise in  Germany  about the same time the first edition of the  Tractatus Tractatuum  sive  Oceanus Juris  vol  fol  But as he had engag'd himself presently after his brother's death not to leave  Venice  as appears by the verses at the end of St  Austin de civitate Dei ann    Qui docuit  Venetos  exscribi posse  Johannes  Mense fere trino centena volumina  Plini  Et totidem magni  Ciceronis Spira  libellos  Coeperat  Aureli  subita sed morte peremptus  Non potuit coeptum  Venetis  finite volumen  Vindelinus  adest ejusdem frater arte  Non minor  Adriacaque  morabitur urbe  begun but not finish'd by his brother he return'd thither and continued printing with prodigious honour till the year wherein he began to fall in with the Gothick character beforemention'd In this he was followed by all the rest and even by the celebrated  Nic Jenson  tho' this last still preserv'd the beauty and neatness of his forms which the others very much  degenerated from About this time  Windelin  probably dy'd because we meet with no impression of his that bears a date later than Such was the esteem the learned had of this excellent Printer that of  twenty eight  impressions we have extant of his above  twenty  of them have a  latin  epigram at the end in praise of him some of which are of a considerable length and most of them by different hands The first edition is that of  Cicero  's  Epistolae familiares ann  the last we know of with a date is  Dante  's  Poems ann  some of his editions are without date  NICHOLAS JENSON JANSON or GENSON  NICH JENSON is allow'd by the generality of writers to have been a Frenchman and as he was one of the first of that nation who was eminent in this Art all his countrymen have been more than ordinarily lavish of their praises on him so that whoever reads some of their encomiums would be apt to think him the only Printer of merit in that age and that there had never been any edition worth their consideration 'till it came out of his press and this they did even before they so much as dreamt of that early masterpiece of his the  Decor Puellarum  we need not therefore wonder at Mr  Mattaire  if we find him so highly pleas'd at the discovery of this singular work for it must be own'd that unless we will dispute the date of it the highest encomiums must fall short of his merit since it will plainly follow that he was not only the earliest by some years who improv'd the Art but likewise who brought it to its greatest perfection with respect to the fineness of his Roman characters and elegancy of composition Whereas were the supposition of those who think it antedated by  ten  years to be allow'd it will be manifest that there had already been several eminent Printers at  Rome Venice  and elsewhere before him who introduc'd that noble and elegant character and that tho' his should be allow'd to be somewhat finer than those of his predecessors yet would his merit be inferior to theirs and his improvement upon them be but small in comparison of that which they made upon the old  Moguntine  types However that be I acknowledge with the greatest freedom and sincerity that he was an excellent master of the Art and his impressions as beautiful and for the last  ten  years space  wherein he follow'd the business as numerous as any of his contemporaries  Polydore Vergil  highly commends him for having so wonderfully improv'd the Art of Printing and  Sabellicus  owns that he and his partner  John de Cologn  excell'd all the Printers of their time in the richness and elegancy of their impressions  Sed omnium maxime opibus eleganti literarum forma multum caeteros antecelluerunt  Nicholates Jenson    Johannes Coloniensis Sabellic  Enead l  The learned  Omnibonus Leonicenus  who prepar'd copies for him and corrected some of his editions hath in an epistle to the bishop of  Belluno  left us an excellent character of him prefix'd to his  Quintilian anno    Accedebant justae preces magistri Nicolai Jenson Gallici alterius ut vere dicam Daedali qui librariae artis mirabilis inventor non ut scribantur calamo libri sed vesuti gemma imprimantur ac prope sigillo primus omnium ingeniose monstravit ut huic viro qui de re literaria tam bene meruit nemo sit qui non favere debeat Idcirco non difficulter impetravit ut non solum hoc opus verum etiam utramque Ciceronis artem corrigerem  wherein he extols his types and mentions him as a second  Daedalus  and as one to whom the greatest share of this invention was due  THE learned therefore are very justly surpriz'd that so excellent a master and so great an ornament to the Art of Printing should be the first who brought the Gothic character to  Venice  in which he printed his bibles divinity and lawbooks This method was follow'd by all his brethren both in that city and in several others of  Europe  tho' it must be own'd that he far surpass'd the rest even in that respect and show'd a more exact taste and judgment for his Gothic types had all the beauty and elegancy which they were capable of and may be still read with pleasure and admiration  I don't find that he had any other corrector besides  Omnibon Leonicenus  abovemention'd if we except  Franciscus Colutia Verzinensis  who in his dedication prefix'd to the work of  Palladius de Agricultura  of which he was the editor tells  Jenson  to whom he dedicates it that it was at his desire that he had undertaken to correct that work By this it seems as if  Jenson  was the first printer who had any of his impressions dedicated to himself Most of his works like those of the two  German  brothers have a  latin  epigram at the end in praise of him but what is remarkable not one of them speaks of him as the first  Venetian  Printer  which circumstance alone would be sufficient to justify us for postponing him to them We meet with four of his editions printed in one year  viz  which shews him to have been a very diligent workman And in the space of ten years we have thirtynine of them still extant exclusive of the  Decor Puellarum  besides those which may have been lost or are still undiscover'd The first edition printed by him in  Gothic  character is St  Austin  's book  de Civitate Dei anno  the two last of his works are dated  CHRISTOPHER WALDARFER of RATISBON  CONCERNING this Printer we know little except that we have four of his editions still extant corrected by  Ludovicus Carbo  or  Carbone  the  third  of which  viz Servius Comment  on  Virgil  fol  anno  has an epigram of  four latin  distichs in his praise by which we may guess that he printed a great many more works than these  four  especially  Classicks  The last of them  viz Pliny's Epistles  hath neither the name of the Printer nor place but by a dedication prefix'd to it by the said  Carbo  to  Borso  duke of  Modena  one may conclude it to have been done by  Waldarfer  He remov'd from  Venice  soon after and set up a Printinghouse at  Milan  where we shall find him when we come to that place  JOHN de COLOGN JOHN MANTHEN de GERETZEN  THESE two  Germans  came and settled at  Venice  soon after the two  Spires  and were equal to any of their contemporaries in the beauty of their Roman types the fineness of their paper and elegance and correctness of their works But they likewise gave into the Gothic way of printing and it is observable that  Venice  and  Lyons  have produc'd more of those impressions than almost all  Italy  and  France  together Whether these Printers were more modest than their brethren is uncertain but however in the list of their editions we meet with none of those pompous epigrams and panegyricks upon themselves so frequently us'd at that time They took  Nic Jenson  into partnership with them towards the later part of their printing  John de Cologn  is affirm'd by  some to have invented the  Registrum Chartarum  about  anno  but it is obvious to the reader from the catalogue of  Uldric Han  's works at  Rome  that the latter us'd it at least two years before him  THERE is one thing remarkable in one of their colophons at the end of their editions of  Valerius Maximus fol anno  and which for that reason I have subjoyn'd in the margin  Venetiis impressoribus expositus fuit per  Joh de Cologn Agrippin  ac  Joh Manthen de Gherretsteim  MCCCCLXXIV qui una fideliter viventes eosdem impressores ad hoc duxerunt  that they were rather booksellers than Printers because they acquaint the readers in it that they had given this work to be printed by men hir'd for that purpose We shall meet with many more in the sequel of this history who follow'd their example  HOWEVER it must be own'd that all the works that came out of their press or were printed for them are an honour to them the last list of their editions according to father  Orlandi  amounts to from  ann  to  As we know little or nothing concerning the following ones besides their names and their works we shall just mention them in their rank according to the date of the works we have of them  ANTONY BOLOGNESE or  Antonio de Bartolomeo de Bolonia  we have  five  editions of his from to  LEONARD ACHATES of  Basil  edition  GABRIEL  de Pietro  of  Treviso  edit to  FRANCIS  de Hailbrun  edit to  NICOL  de Francford  edit to  BARTOLOMEW CREMONESE edit to  JAMES  des Rouges    THIS was his true name he being a  Frenchman  tho' in his  latin  editions he writes himself  Jacobus Rubeus  or  de Rubeis  and in his  Italian  ones  di Rossi  and  Rossi  He was justly esteem'd one of the best Printers in his time 'Tis affirm'd by some that he assisted  Nic Jenson  in improving his Roman characters but this is improbable because it doth not appear that he came to  Venice  'till two or three years at least after the other had publish'd some of his fine editions However the beauty of his letter and the fineness of his impressions are incomparable particularly the two  histories of  Florence  in  Italian  one written by  Leonard de Arezo  and the other by  Poggius  are accounted masterpieces in that kind At length he left  Venice  and settled at  Pignerol  in  Piedmont  where he printed an  Italian Bible  the satyrs of  Juvenal  and some other work which we shall speak of in its proper place There is one thing more to enhance his merit which is that he comply'd not with the degenerate taste of those times in introducing the Gothic characters into his Printinghouse his impressions from  anno  to are ten in number  CHRISTOPHER ARNOLD we have but two editions of his from to  ANDREAS JACOBI of  Cathara  editions from to  MARC  de Conti  and

fifteenth century was born  anno  when Printing was yet in its intancy who as he grew up became such an admirer of this new Art  that tho' his education learning and genius might have justly excited him to greater employments yet he chose to devote his whole time and study to the cultivating and improving all the branches of it This design he perform'd with such indefatigable application and vast cha  ges that his whole ambition seem'd to be confin'd to this province and the advancement of learning  Omnem enim vitam decrevimus ad hominum utilitatem consumerenam etsi quietam ac tranquillam

Greek  and  Latin  tongues under the great  Baptista Guarini  of  Verona  and in a short time made such a progress in these languages as not only to surpass his fellow students but even to rival his master himself Thus he continued furnishing his mind with every part of literature in order to fit himself for that business of which he was afterwards to become the ornament The war breaking out in

produc'd and one of the greatest l  vers of learning and of learned men who not only receiv'd him with open arms but procur'd him the acquaintance of many learned men by whose conversation and correspondence  Aldus  receiv'd no small advantage toward the acquiring that great knowledge of the  Greek  and  Latin  Tongues which he became afterwards so famous for In the th year of his age  anno  he began to prepare the necessary  apparatus  of a Printinghouse wherein he spent  four  years and consequently did not begin Printing till about  anno  During this interval he observ'd with regret to what degree the abbreviations us'd by all the former Printers every where were multiply'd so that they became unintelligible without some key to direct the reader an instance of which is given in the margin  This curious example of the abbreviations us'd in those times is extracted from  Okam  's logick folio verso leaf as follows  Sĩ hic ε̃ fα̃l s̃ m q̃d  d simplr̃ α̃ e p̃ducibile a deo g̃ α̃ ε̃ s lr̃ hic a ñ ε̃ g̃ a α̃ ε̃ p̃ducibile a deo c which words printed at full length will run thus  Sicut hic est fallacia secundum quid ad simpliciter A est producibile a deo Ergo A est sim liter hic A non est ergo non est producibile a deo  Vide Chevil p  These abbreviations were grown in time so numerous and universal that books were oblig'd to be publish'd to teach the method of reading and understanding them  Upon this he consider'd a method to remedy this inconvenience  and set them quite aside in his editions But because the printing the words at length would enlarge the volumes a fourth part for there was scarce one word in five that was not abridg'd and encrease the price he resolv'd likewise to remedy that To which end he invented the  Italick  character call'd from him  Aldine  or  Cursivus  and  Cancellarius  from its resemblance to handwriting which byits figure and closeness gain'd as much upon the round Roman as the abbreviations did and reduc'd the volume to near an exact bulk thereby rendering them absolutely useless This is the main tho' not the sole advantage which he propos'd by this new character for the world has since found its extraordinary usefulness in many other respects which being obvious to every person I shall not particularise here but mention only the agreeableness of a mixture of Roman and Italick However it must be own'd that  Aldus  made too great use of the latter in printing whole volumes in that character which is known to tire the eyes much more than the Roman Upon this account several emineat Printers afterwards rejected it in their quotations when they were of any considerable length and substituted Double comma's or Guillemets at one end of the lines to distinguish the citations from the body of the book which Guillemets were so call'd from their Inventor a  French  Printer of that name  To return to  Aldus  s soon as he had persected this new character which must necessarily cost him prodigious summs of money he obtain'd a privilege from three several Popes for the sole use of them during the s  e of  fifteen  years and these pontifs give him great encomiums upon the account of this invention The first of these was granted him by  Alexander  VI and is dated  Sept  with the following preface  Quoniam dilectus filius noster  Aldus Manucius Romanus  ad communem doctorum utilitatem novisexcogitatis characterum formis assiduam operam libris emendandis imprimendisque impendit magnosque in ea re labores sumptus que facit vereturque ne insurgente invidia aemulationeque excitata aliqui sumpto de ejus characteribus exemplo ad eandem formam libros imprimant deque alterius invento novum sibi lucrum quaerant ideo nobis fecit humiliter supplicari  c    "For as much as our beloved son  Aldus Manucius Romanus  hath for the common benefit of the learned invented a new sett of characters and been at vast pains and charges in correcting and printing of booksand is afraid lest some thro' envy or emulation should get patterns  of his characters and print with them thereby reaping the benefit of another man's invention he hath therefore humbly besought us  c  "  HE obtain'd the like privilege from Pope  Julius  II within four months after the first  viz Jan  which begins thus  "For as much as thouhast been at the pains to print with such diligence and elegancy within these few years and for the common benefit of all the learned many  greek  and  latin  volumes corrected and revis'd with the utmost care and diligence in those new characters which are vulgarly known by the name of  Cursivi  and  Cancellarii  and are so beautiful as to seem written by hand  c  "  Cum tuGraecorum Latinorum auctorum volumina summa cura diligentia castigata a paucis annis ad communem omnium litteratorum utilitatem characteribus quos vulgus  Cursives  seu  a  cellarios  appellas imprimi tam diligenter pulchre curaveris ut calamo conscripta esse videantur  c  HIS successor  Leo  X likewise granted him a brief to the same purpose within ten months after expresly prohibiting any person to print in or imitate that character during the space of  fifteen  years  Ne per spatium quindecim annorum iis characteribus quos ipse invenit vel edidit primus imprimereneve characteres quos  Cursivos  seu  Cancellarios  appellant imitari praesumant  c    'TIS apparent from the tenour of these briefs that this Italick character was not the only particular wherein  Aldus  signaliz'd himself for the number and correctness of his editions with the beauty of his characters gain'd him the esteem and admiration of the learned nor need I tell the reader how highly all his works have been valued ever since as well as those of his son  Paulus Manucius  of his soninlaw  Andreas Azolanus  and his grandson  Aldus  which are of equal merit with his own and of equal value His ambition of being esteem'd not only a man of letters as he really was but also the most correct Printer of the age was such that he spar'd no cost in procuring the best MSS nor labour in revising them and his care was so great lest any errors should escape him either in the M S or proofs that as we are assur'd by  Angel Roccha  keeper of the  Vatican  library he would not allow himself to print above two sheets in a week  Audivi ab iis qui cum eo versati suntduo ad summum folia singula quaque hebdomada imprimi solere cum hodie totidem fere in singulo quoque praelo quotidie cudantur  Ang Roc de bibliotheca Vaticana  pag  But this must be understood only of such works as requir'd  a more than ordinary diligence and application otherwise it were difficult to reconcile this with what  Aldus  says in his preface to  Euripides ann    Quandoquidem mille amplius boni alicujus auctoris volumina singulo quoque mense emittimus  that he publish'd some good author every month of which he printed above a  thousand  copies or with what  Erasmus  says of him in his proverbs  Aldus  bibliothecam molitur cujus non alia septa sunt quam ipsius orbis  Erasm Chtl    Cent    Prov    that he was erecting a library whose limits would be those of the world it self However that be his accuracy and diligence is unquestionably attested by all the learned and he tells Pope  Leo  X in his petition beforemention'd that the height of his ambition was to present the world with authors corrected with the utmost exactness and that nothing was more mortifying to him than to see any faults in his impressions  every one of which he would gladly if possible have redeem'd at the price of a crown of gold  Sic doleo ut si possem mutarem singula errata nummo aureo  What assistance he had from the learned in correcting his books may be gather'd from his preface to the  Greek  edition of  Aristotle  's  Logick  where he assures us  that he had some of the ablest criticks with him to assist in the correction  and in the preface to the  physicks  of that philosopher he boasts  that his impressions were more perfect and correct than the very originals from which they were printed  Dicere queo quicquid meo labore formis excuditur ipsis exemplaribus longe correctius ac magis perfectum exire ex aedibus nostris    BUT it must be own'd that the learned are far from granting him this last piece of merit which he challenges and some of them have objected that he either printed them not according to the best manuscripts or corrected them by his own conjectures or follow'd sometimes too scrupulously those which were faulty and imperfect Upon this account  Erasmus  tho' a great friend of his complains that  Michael Bentius  who printed his proverbs  had follow'd the corrupt editions of  Aldus  in the quotations from  Homer  and  Cicero  Nam  Michael Bentius  contulit quaedam loca a me citata ex Graeco  Homero  ab  Aldo  excuso item ex  Cicerone Aldino  cum  Aldina  sint depravatissima  Vita Erasmi Lugdun Batav in    o  pag  The same author tells  John Betzemius  in a letter sent with a catalogue of his works  that some of  Plutarch's  books were printed by  Aldus  after some very corrupt manuscript  Hoc unum erat incommodi quod  Aldus  hoc opus excudit secundum exemplar multis locis depravatum  Tom    oper Erasm  Yet he excuses  him in another letter  Officina Veneta dedit nobis  Festum Pompeium  egregie depravatum non insimulo  Aldum  solet ille tales operas alicui Paedagogo committere Pag supradict edit  Lugdun Batav  and lays the blame upon some  Pedagogue whom  Aldus  intrusted with the care of some of the editions of ancient authors  If this be fact 'tis very much to be regretted that so great a Printer to whom the republick of learning is in all other respects so much oblig'd should be overseen in a matter of such importance And this in all probability is the reason why he thus expresses his dissatisfaction at his own editions in the petition to the Pope beforemention'd  Sed ego non credulus illis nullum enim adhuc dedi librum in quo mihi ipsi satisfecerim  that he was so far from regarding the flatteries of some persons that he had not as yet publish'd one book with which he could be satisfied  Sed ego non credulus illis nullum enim adhuc dedi librum in quo mihi ipsi satisfecerim    BESIDES this he carries his complaints still further and inveighs loudly against two sorts of men who alone are capable of depriving the learned world of the benefit of printing unless some speedy stop be put to their wretched performances the first are those who notwithstanding their notorious ignorance and incapacity presume to print any kind of books the  second  are the half learned editors who not only venture upon publishing ancient authors but likewise write notes and commentaries with their own corrections upon them Thus was this great man concern'd to see the corruptions already crept into the Art thro' the avarice of some and ignorance of others whilst himself found by sad experience that all his care as well as learning was scarce sufficient for such a task As no Printer ever surpass'd him in the latter so none ever equall'd him in the former for so indefatigable was he in that laborious province that he scarce allow'd himself time to eat sleep or attend his domestick affairs and which is still more was so regardless of his health as to neglect those pleasures and recreations so necessary and conducive to the preservation of it The learned  Zuinger  in his  Theatrum vitae humanae  p of the  Basil  edition tells us that his mind was entirely engaged in the care of his Printinghouse that as soon as he had order'd his other necessary affairs he shut himself up in his study where he employ'd himself in revising his  greek  and  latin  manuscripts reading the letters which he receiv'd from the learned out of all parts of the world and writing  answers to them To prevent interruption by impertinent visits he caus'd the following inscription to be plac'd over his closet door  Quisquis es rogat te  Aldus  etiam atque etiam ut siquid est quod a se velis pe  paucis agas deinde actutum abeas nisi tanquam Hercules veneris suppositu  us humeros semper enim erit quod tu agas quotquot huc a  tulerint pedes    Whoever you are  Aldus  earnestly intreats you to dispatch your business as soon as possible and then depart unless you come hither like another  Hercules  to lend him some friendly assistance for here will be work sufficient to employ you and as many as enter this place  These words were afterwards borrow'd by the learned  Oporinus  who from a professor of the  greek  tongue in the university of  Basil  became one of the most eminent Printers either of that city or even of  Europe  and were set over his study door for the same intent  ALDUS is affirm'd by many authors to have been the first who printed whole volumes in  greek  particularly the learned  Henry Stephens  asserts both in the  Complaint of the Art of Printing  written by him and in his epitaph upon  Aldus  that he was the first Printer in that language  Qui graphicis primus tradidit illa typis  and  Gesner  tells  Paul Manutius Aldus  's son in the th book of his Pandects that if he is not mistaken there were no  greek  books printed before those of his father or at least not with equal beauty and correctness with his  Exemplaria Graeca ante patrem tuum aut nulla ni  allor aut pauca nec ea industria typis pu  licata sunt  Tho' this is not strictly true as we shall immediately shew yet as he was the greatest Printer in  greek  and inventor of a beautiful character these and several other authors might easily attribute to him the first rank in this province The first  greek  book was publish'd by him  anno  as appears by the lists which the annalists give us of his works and from what  Aldus  himself says in hi  preface to  Stephanus de urbibus anno    Eodem anno quo vexari bello coepit  Italia  difficillimam hanc ego imprimendorum librorum provinciam accepi  that he begun his first  greek  impressions in the year wherein the war in  Italy  commenc'd  viz anno  at the time of the expedition of  Charles  VIII king of  France  to seize upon the kingdom of  Naples  Some writers from a mistaken passage in his preface to  Aristotle anno  wherein he tells his patron Prince  Carpi  that he presents him with the prince of philosophers  Plato  excepted now first printed and very correct have thought  it to have been his first  greek  impression whereas he publish'd at least  three  the year before However 'tis plain he had printed no book in any language before  anno    IT appears from what has been said in a former chapter concerning the  Lactantius  printed in the monastery of  Subiaco anno  the  Gellius  at  Rome  and others that several considerable fragments were printed in  greek  with no small elegancy and correctness But besides these there were several editions in that language printed in divers cities of  Italy  some years before the principal of which we shall mention  THE  first  as yet known is the  greek  grammar of  Constantine Lascaris  to revis'd by  Demetrius Cretensis  and printed by  Dionysius Palavisinus  at  Milan anno  afterwards reprinted at  Venice  by  Leonard  of  Basil anno    THE next is the  greek  psalter printed at  Venice anno  by  Alexander  of  Crete  to and  Homer  's  Batrachomuomachia  or battle between the frogs and mice to at  Venice  by  Leonic  of  Crete  in the same year But as these may be esteem'd only preludes or essays in that language we shall come to a more considerable edition  viz  that of  Homer  's works in  greek  which  B Neril  caus'd to be printed at  Florence  in a large  folio anno  by  Demetrius  of  Milan  a native of  Crete  This excellent work I have seen in the curious library of the learned Dr  Mead  and I dare affirm that whoever examines the whiteness and strength of the paper the fineness of the character the elegant disposition of the matter the exact distance between the lines the large margin and in short the whole performance with its various ornaments will easily own it a masterpiece in that kind There was likewise a fine edition of  Isocrates  printed at  Milan  in  fol  by  Henry German  and  Sebastian ex Pontremulo anno  a year before any of  Aldus  's impressions appear'd  HOWEVER tho' he was not the first  greek  Printer yet no person ever signaliz'd himself more in that province than he nor equall'd him in beauty correctness and number of editions Concerning the beauty of his  greek  characters of which he is said to be the inventor Mr  Mattaire  tells us  pag    Annal Typogr  that those in which he printed the  Psalter Aesop Aristotle Aristophanes  c were somewhat larger rounder more beautiful and elegant adorn'd with frequent ligatures which added no small  beauty to his  greek  editions  c  Nor is this is the only particular for which the learned world is so much oblig'd to him since his designs reach'd still farther and were answer'd to his great satisfaction before his death which happen'd  anno  He observ'd with no small regret how much and how long the  Greek  tongue had been neglected in order therefore to revive that noble language and accustom the learned by degrees to read nothing but the originals he resolv'd to publish most of his books in  Greek  only This succeeded so well that the oldest men began to acquaint themselves with it and as many youths engaged in the study of that tongue as of the  Latin  which gave him such sensible pleasure that he mentions it in several of his prefaces and particularly in that prefix'd to  Aristotle  's  Logic  wherein he thus expresses himself  Nostris vero temporibus multos licet videre  hoc est senes in senectute Graece discere Nam adolescentulorum ac juvenum Graecis incumbentium jam tantas fere est numerus quantus eorum qui Latinis Propterea Graeci libri vehementer ab omnibus inquiruntur quorum quia mira paucitas est  c  "In our days we may see many old gentlemen who follow  Cato  's example in learning the  Greek  tongue For with respect to the youth they equally apply themselves to that as to the  Latin  Upon which account  Greek  books of which there is now a prodigious scarcity are come into very great request  c  "  In his preface to  Stephanus de urbibus  he observes with pleasure  Nam non in  Italia  solum sed etiam in  Germa a Calna Pannonia Britannia Hispania  ubique fere ubi Romana lingua legitur non modo ab adolescentibus juvenibusque sed a senibus quoque summa aviditate studetur literis Graecis  "That  Italy  was not the only nation where in the  Greek  tongue was in vogue but that in  Germany France Hungary Britain Spain  and almost every place where the  Latin  was known not only the young but even the old study'd  Greek  with the utmost eagerness and application"  ALL his impressions were not of that nature for in some of them printed before and afterwards as  Musaeus Greek grammar Proclus  's  Sphaera  the works of  Philostratus Eusebius contra Hieroclem  c he first gave the whole  Greek  text and then the  Latin  translation  SOON after this he invented a method entirely new of printing these  Greek  editions with their translations which I do not find practis'd by any Printer since  THEY were impos'd after such a manner that the purchaser might have them bound either with the  Greek  and  Latin  separate or with a leaf of the one and a leaf of the other alternately for instance the  first  leaf was  Greek  then follow'd the  first  in  Latin  then the  second Greek  leaf and the  second Latin  and so on to the end but with this precaution that the  Greek  of the  first  leaf was only printed upon the  second  page of it and the  Latin  version opposite to it the  Latin  upon the  second  page of the  Latin  leaf was the version of the  Greek  upon the  first  page of the  third  leaf and all the  Greek  upon the  second  page of this leaf fell exactly over against the  Latin  of it in the  first  page of the  fourth  or  second Latin  leaf This order being observ'd throughout every other leaf being  Greek  and the rest  Latin  it was easy either to bind it in two volumes the one  Greek  and the other  Latin  or into one with the original first and version afterwards opposite to each other  BUT as we remark'd before this excellent method was never observ'd not even by those who reprinted such of  Aldus  's editions as had been done after this way  viz Esop  's and  Gabriel  's fables  Lascaris  's grammar  c  for they printed the  Greek  in one page and the  Latin  upon the other which is vastly more inconvenient than his method the manner of printing both languages in two columns not being invented 'till after the year  Vide Chevil  pag I conceive there is no necessity of giving a more particular description of  Aldus  's  Greek  types because his works are so universally known to the curious but whoever desires to know further concerning them and their superior excellence to those us'd before may consult Mr  Mattaire  's  Annals  pag  ALDUS has been likewise suppos'd the first or at least one of the first who printed in  Hebrew  But this is certainly a mistake for tho' he had a font of  Hebrew  yet he made but little use of it and 'tis evident that the jews of  Soncino  in the duchy of  Milan  began to print books in that language about  twelve  or  fourteen  years before  Aldus  appear'd as shall be shewn in its proper place  Chevillier  p tells us that he saw nothing of his in this tongue but the  Hebrew  alphabet which is still preserv'd in the  Sorbon  library We find however that he wrote and printed an introduction to the  Hebrew  tongue as appears from  book printed by him  ann  intitled  Aldi Manutii Grammaticae Latinae  linguae rudimenta de literis Graecis Diphthongis  c  ut introductio ad Hebraeam linguam  to Indeed  Justin Decadius  a  Grecian  and inhabitant of  Venice  who caus'd the  Greek  psalter to be printed by  Aldus  in to flatters those of his own nation to whom he dedicates it with a promise which that Printer made him of printing an edition of the bible in  Hebrew Greek  and  Latin  but it is not known that he ever perform'd it at least with relation to the  Hebrew  BEFORE we close the character of this great man it will be proper to acquaint the reader with the reason of his assuming the name  Pius  after the year because even this is another testimony of his merit He receiv'd it from his patron prince  Albertus Pius de Carpi  whose tutor he had formerly been and who on account of his singular desert adopted him into his family and contributed large sums towards defraying the charges of procuring and correcting manuscripts preparing three fonts of  Italick Greek  and  Hebrew  characters entertaining so many learned correctors and such a number of workmen beside the other charges common to every Printinghouse His chief correctors were  Peter Alcyonius Demetrius Chalcondylas Marcus Musurus  and  Alexander Bondinus  THE mark of his Printinghouse which shall be given with the rest of the marks or rebus's of the Printers of the th century at the end of this book was a dolphin twin'd about an anchor and nibling at it signifying his close and indesatigable application to business which he went through with deliberation and judgment  Chevillier  tells us that he took it from the emperor  Titus  and that  Peter Bembus  who was afterwards made a cardinal presented him with a silver medal which had that emperor's head on one side and on the reverse a dolphin twisting himself round an a  hor This was likewise according to some authors the device of  Augustus  the emperor  festina lent    the anchor being design'd to signify rest as lightning or the dolphin were to denote swiftness These  Titus  afterwards express'd by the dolphin signifying swiftness and an anchor design'd to stop the course of a ship denoting slowness  Aldus  himself seems to hint at this signification when he tells prince  Carpi  in his epistle dedicatory prefix'd to  Proclus  's  Sphere anno    Sum ipse mihi optimus testis me semper habere comites ut oportere aiunt delphinum anchoram nam dedimus multa cunctando damus assidue  that he could testify  for himself with the greatest sincerity that he had always those two companions with him which they say are so necessary  viz  the dolphin and anchor and publish'd many things with deliberation and yet without intermission His son  Paul  who was Printer to the  Vatican  his soninlaw  A de Azola  and his grandson  Aldus  us'd the same mark  SOME vile Printers of  Florence  finding the impossibility of equalling  Aldus  's editions resolv'd to counterfeit them as well as his rebus and carry'd on the cheat for some time 'till it was discover'd by means of a mistake committed by the engraver who revers'd the dolphin so that his head was on the left side of the anchor whereas in  Aldus  's mark it was on the right Whether his soninlaw  Andreas de Azola  first perceiv'd this difference I will not affirm but he first gave publick notice of it to prevent the world's being any longer impos'd upon This passage in the preface to his  Livy  in vo  anno  is given at full length in the margin  Extremum est ut admoneamus  Florenti  s  quosdam impressores cum viderint diligentiam nostram in castigando imp  imendo non posse assequi ad artes confugisse solitas hoc est grammaticis institutionibus  Alds  in sua officina formatis notam delphini anchorae involuti nostram apposuisse sed ita egerunt ut quivis mediocriter versatus in libris impressionis nostrae animadvertat illos imprudenter fecisse Nam rost  um delphini in partem sinistram vergit cum tamen nostrum in dexteram totum demittatur  I am sensible that in this sketch of the history of that Printer I have exceeded in many cases my propos'd limits yet I hope the worth and character of the person will sufficiently excuse me for not keeping too scrupulously to our epocha  THE works which we have of him from to are in number twenty four fourteen of which are  Greek  and the rest  Latin  or  Latin  and  Greek  THE reader may easily perceive how short this list comes of the number which we might have reasonably expected from so industrious a Printer within the space of six or seven years especially considering that as himself assures us he publish'd an author every month which amounts to almost four times our number Whether the rest are perish'd or are still latent in some libraries I shall not determine but am willing to hope the latter and that time will by degrees bring them to light  HOWEVER he still continued printing many years after the close of the century and took his fatherinlaw  Andreas de Azola  in  Latin Azolanus  in partnership with him As to the time of his death or any particulars of it I have not been able to discover any thing certain I shall therefore conclude his history with a remark or two concerning an edition of his which I hope will not be disagreeable to the reader it is that of  Poliphili hypnerotomachia  written by  Franciscus Columna  to prove that all the world is but a dream wherein he relates many things worth learning it has been suppos'd to be printed at  Treviso anno  because at the end are the following words  Tarvisii cum decorissimis Poliae a more lorulis distineretur misellus Poliphilus  MCCCCLXVII  kalendis Maii i e  when the unfortunate  Poliphilus  was in love with the charming  Polia    THIS they thought to have been the year when the book was printed whereas  Mattaire  and  Orlandi  observe that the words plainly demonstrate it to be the year in which  Colonna  finish'd it Besides it is evident from the character the registers directionwords comma's interrogatory points and other particularities as well from the last leaf which contains the errata and concludes thus  Venetiis mense Decembri  MID  in aedibus Aldi Manutii accuratissimé  that this edition came out from  Aldus  's press However  Orlandi  tells us that this leaf was designedly torn off because there is no date of the year in which it was printed but Mr  Mattaire  gives us an account of these errata  pag  which bore this title  Gli errori del libro fatti stampando liquali corrige cosi  then follows the errata containing fifty nine full lines a greater number than  Aldus  ever put at the end of his works After the errata are the  Latin  words abovemention'd  Venetiis  c 'Tis plain from this that was the year in which the author finish'd it at  Treviso  and the date of the edition With respect to the author's name  Orlandi  deduceth it from the initial letters of each chapter which being joyn'd together form these words  Poliam frater Franciscus Columna peramavit Orland  pag  THE remainder of the  Venetian  Printers to  ann  are as follows  ANTONY MORETUS of  Brescia  edit  JEROM  de Alexandria  ANTONY ZANCHI or  de Zanchis  edit  OTINUS  della Luna  of  Pavia  edit from to  JOHN ALVYSIUS  de Varesio Milanese  edit  BARTHOL JUSTINOPOLITANUS  GABRIEL  de Brisighella  JOHN BISSOLI  BENEDICT MANGI of  Carpi  WE have but two editions of these four partners  viz Phalaris Epistles  to and  Aesop  's life and fables to both in  Greek  the former of these editions has a privilege from the senate of  Venice  for their sole printing of it during the space of ten years and an epistle of  Bartholomew Justinopolitan  to  Contarenus  a senator of  Venice  wherein he complains of the great abuses which were crept into the Art of Printing and the disadvantages thence arising to the common wealth of learning thro' the ignorance and negligence of Printers which encreas'd every day among them he seems therefore rather to have been an editor than a Printer and to have hir'd the other three to print in partnership with him  ANTONY  de Guzzago  of  Brescia  edit  SEBASTIAN MANILIUS a Roman and partners edit  JOHN BAPT SESSA of  Milan  edit  ZACHARIAH CALIERGI of  Crete  he was a very eminent Printer of  Greek  we have two editions of his both of  viz Simplicius Comment  upon  Aristotle  's  Cathegorics fol  and  Etymologicum magnum fol  in  Greek  the last of these printed at the desire of a  Constantinopolitan  lady he remov'd to  Rome  and printed there till  ann  if not beyond and the  Lexicon Varini  was printed by him in that year  LUCANTONIUS  de Giunta  or  Zunta  of  Florence    ALL the Printers of this name  de Giunta  or  Zunta  have been persons of the most distinguish'd merit for their performances at  Rome Florence Lyons  and  Venice  their common rebus or mark was the  flowerdeluce  and sometimes the  eagle  The first of that name is this  Lucantonius Giunta  a man of noble extract who employ'd  John de Spira  to print for him at  Venice  WHETHER this  Spira  was a son or grandson of one of the two brothers who first brought the Art to this city is uncertain However the  Giunta's  signaliz'd themselves in that Art 'till the middle of the sixteenth century The following edition is the only one we know of printed by him before the close of this century  viz Regulae sancti  Benedicti  sancti  Basilii  sanct  Augustini    Francisci  collectae atque ordinatae per  D J Franc Brixianum  monachum congregationis S  Justinae  ordinis S  Benedicti  de observantia  to  cura impensis nobilis viri  Luc Antonii  de  Giunta Florentini  arte solerti ingenio magistri

edition dated  ALBERTINE VERCELLENSIS edit dated  THESE are all the Printers hitherto known to have wrought at  Venice  from the time of its receiving the Art to the year but there were many more who as was hinted before made a trade of reprinting some of the best editions in a slovenly incorrect manner and to undersell the good ones for which reason they did not dare to set their names to them Father  Orlandi  gives us a list of of them done at  Venice  during that interval the greatest part of which I am apt to suspect are of that sorry kind  CHAP V Of the three first Printers at Paris and their Successors the Encouragement which they met with some Account of the Books printed by them with other Particulars A second Printinghouse set up in the Louvre by King Lewis XI rest of the Paris Printers  WHOEVER desires a compleat account of the first settlement progress and improvement of the Art of Printing in the city and university of  Paris  the metropolis of  France  will find that subject copiously treated of by  De la Caille  in his  Origine de l'imprimerie  printed  anno  and more particularly by  Chevillier  in his  Origine de l'Imprimerie  printed at  Paris anno    THESE two authors have chiefly confin'd their history to that kingdom and as they had all possible opportunities of searching the records and libraries of that university have been enabled to acquaint the world with a vast many particularities relating as well to the Art a  to the most eminent Printers there But since an induction of them would swell this work to too great a bulk I shall select the most curious and material parts and refer the reader for the rest to the authors before mention'd Sufficient reasons I hope are already given against the opinion of those who contrary to all the most incontestable records assert that  Nich Jenson  first brought printing to  Paris  This particular is further confirm'd by the two last mention'd  French  historians whose account of that matter is as follows  SOME time before the year  William Fichet  and  John Heynlim de Lapide  or  Lapidanus  two famous doctors of the university of  Paris  and of the college of  Sorbon  observing the progress of printing in several cities of  Europe  began to use their utmost efforts in order to introduce it not only into that city but even into their college where they might give it all necessary help and encouragement They were both persons of great reputation for their learning and publick spirit The former was a  Savoyard  by birth and a great restorer of the long neglected art of rhetorick and all polite literature The latter was a  German  and had been rector of the university and prior of the college of  Sorbon  to which last dignity he was chosen again about this time As there were then but few if any except  Germans  eminent in printing  Lapidanus  undertook to bring some of the most skilfull thither This could not but seem easily attainable by him who had such a numerous acquaintance amongst the learned in  Germany  and is suppos'd upon good grounds to have been of the same diocess if not the same city with  Uldric Gering  a native of  Constance  The latter being influenc'd by the kind invitations of a person of such esteem who promis'd him the college of  Sorbon  for his abode and his assistance in procuring and preparing manuscripts and revising his editions and allur'd by the hopes of considerable gain in so rich a city wherein the Art was yet unpractis'd brought two other countrymen with him  viz Martin Crantz  and  Michael Friburger  or  de Columbaria  or  Colmar  in  Alsace  to  Paris  where he set up presses in the  hall of  Sorbon  and in the year publish'd the first book that ever was printed in any city of  France  except that of  Tours  mention'd in a former chapter Father  Orlandi  tells us that  Lewis  XI gave  Fitchet  and  Lapidanus  orders to send for some of the best Printers to  Paris  at his own charge and that by this means the three  German  partners were induc'd to settle there  Chevillier  takes no notice of this but attributes the honour wholly to the  Sorbonists  However it is certain that this king was a great encourager of learning as appears by the magnificent library which he form'd at his palace in  Paris  whither he brought not only all the books which his predecessors and in particular  Charles  V sirnam'd the wise and  Charles  VI had collected and set up at  Fountainbleau  but likewise all that he could purchase at any rate together with a great number of editions printed at  Mentz  by  Faust  and  Schoeffer  and what manuscripts he could not purchase he order'd to be curiously transcrib'd and to be set up there A remarkable instance of this mention'd by the  French  writers is as follows  THE king understanding that the college of physicians at  Paris  had in their library the works of  Rhasis  a physician translated out of  Arabick  into  Latin  sent to borrow it in order to have it transcrib'd but the college representing it as against their constitutions to lend any of their books without a sufficient pledge his majesty was contented to obtain the use of it by depositing a large quantity of his own plate Whether therefore the king or the two doctors brought the first Printers to  Paris  'tis beyond doubt that he gave them sufficient encouragement and access to the library at the  Louvre  with liberty to print from any of those volumes in the choice of which it is probable they were directed by their two patrons  As the Art was then in its infancy at  Paris  their first editions were in a large round Roman character but greatly inferior in beauty to that of their contemporaries in  Italy  their paper was smooth and strong tho' less white their impressions were maim'd and imperfect with letters and words half printed and finish'd with a pencil the inscription and title of some epistles and the large initial letters of books and chapters were done with the hand for which a blank was left in the page they had no capitals nor regular spaces but were full of abbreviations in short  there was nothing to recommend them except the newness and the beauty of the ink They us'd few rubricks and those only upon vellum some of their books begin at the  folio verso  or even page and all of them are without titles number of pages signatures or directionwords they us'd no signatures 'till the year and then plac'd them not at the bottom but at the top of the pages they added neither date nor names of Printer and place all which are only to be gathered from the prefaces or epigrams at the end or some other circumstances as will appear from the list of their works especially of those printed in the three first years and It is certainly very surprising that neither  Gering  nor his two learned patrons who must infallibly have seen some of the  Italian  editions especially those of  Rome  and  Venice  which had all these necessary ornaments should not make them sensible of their deficiencies in all those respects However so few were the elegant Printers in those days that the learned men of  Paris  who esteem'd the Art of more consequence than these embellishments fail'd not to acknowledge their obligation to the  Sorbon  doctors for the services they had done to the university in settling the Printers there upon whom they were equally liberal of their encomiums Enough of these may be seen in  Chevillier  pag  seq  I shall only cite in the margin an epigram printed at the end of  Gaspar Pergamensis  's epistles which was their first impression and had prefix'd to it a letter of thanks to those great men upon their bringing the Art to that city  THE epigram  Ut sol lumen sic doctrinam fundis in orbem  Musarum nutrix regia  Parisius  Hinc prope divinam tu quam  Germania  novit  Artem scribendi suscipe promerita  Primos ecce libros quos haec iudustria finxit  Francorum in terris aedibus atque tuis  Michael Uldaricus Martinusque  magistri  Hos impresserunt ac facient alios  is address'd to the city of  Paris  and sufficiently shews not only that this edition was the first fruits of the Art both in that city and kingdom against those who ascribe that honour to  Jenson  but likewise that the  Parisians  congratulated themselves for their success in introducing it thither since it gave the university an absolute authority over  all Printers and booksellers in the  seven  following particulars mention'd by  Chevillier  pag  viz  THAT all the Printers and booksellers of  Paris  after the first settlement of printing there have still continued in their former state that is been esteem'd as agents and servants to that university  THAT they are oblig'd to take the oaths to the rector of it  THAT they are not allow'd to follow that business 'till the university has judg'd them qualify'd for it  THAT the university exercises their jurisdiction over them by summoning them to appear  c  by fining punishing and deposing them for any misdemeanor  THAT the edicts and ordinances of the king impower that body to visit and search all Printinghouses warehouses for books and booksellers shops  c  THAT the university set a price upon their books which was affix'd to their catalogues and plac'd in some conspicuous part of their shops lest any person might be impos'd on by them This part of their province they exerted long before the Art of Printing was discover'd over all transcribers illuminators booksellers  c  LASTLY that the booksellers  c  should sell no books of religion  c  'till they had been examin'd and approv'd by the university or at least by the faculty of doctors of divinity  WE shall shew in the third book of this history that the university of  Oxsord  had the same authority over the Printers and booksellers of that city  TO return to our three Printers they continued printing but three years at the house of the  Sorbon  after which one of their patrons  Fichet  being invited to  Rome  by Pope  Sixtus  IV and the other intending soon after to return to  Germany  they remov'd to St  James'sstreet  at the sign  of the  Golden Sun  Upon this they immediately rejected all their old punches matrices and letters and furnish'd themselves with some entirely new and printed several considerable volumes 'till the year at which time  Crantz  and  Friburger  either return'd into  Germany  or at least left off printing for there is no edition with their names after that year but  Gering  printed in his own name many years longer as shall be shewn in its place In the mean time it will be proper to give the reader an account of this new set of characters which they made use of in their new house  'TIS to be observ'd that they were of three or four sorts all different from each other and from those us'd at the house of the  Sorbon  and cast in new matrices One sort is vastly inferior to their former and resembles the handwriting of that time but such as was done  stannea manu  as  Aldus  expresses it with a heavy hand  IT is not however altogether Gothic but rather like that which  Schoeffer  us'd at  Mentz  Another sort was not unlike this in shape but of a much larger face The  third  was a Roman much more round and fine than the two former but the  fourth  sort not us'd by  Gering  'till after the year that is after his partners had left him is a very beautiful large Roman which if we may believe  Chevillier  who saw and compar'd them is in no case inferior to that of the  Spira  's  Jenson  or any other of the famous  Venetian  and  French  Printers either before or since Thus  Gering  attain'd to a degree of perfection equal with any of his brethren but was at last oblig'd to comply with the custom and print several books in Gothic such as  Virgil  and some others besides those for the use of churches The editions printed at this house and in these new characters are still defective with respect to their dates or Printers names some wanting the one some the other and some both as appears by the list of his works given us by the foremention'd author  anno    Gering  took into partnership with him for some time  William Maynyal  and in the year remov'd from St  James'sstreet  and took a lease during life of a house belonging to the college of  Sorbon  where he set up his old sign of the  Goldensun  As he was now become very rich and had contracted an intimate friendship with the  Sorbon  collegians he made them some considerable donatives both in books  and money upon which account they chose him fellow of that college and assign'd him chambers and commons in it and as he was not engag'd in matrimony he took the more pleasure in conversing with them communicating his designs and using their advice about the books which he was to print and their assistance in correcting them in return for which he presented them with copies of all his editions It was no small advantage to that college which was call'd at first by the founder  Robert Sorbon Societas pauperum magistrorum Parisiis in theologica facultate studentium  to have so generous a friend and benefactor admitted into it who requited them for this honour with vast legacies left by him in his will to this college and that of  Montague  in the same city For by his success in printing 'till  anno  in which he died he had amass'd a prodigious quantity of wealth all which he bequeath'd to those two colleges What he endow'd the  Sorbon  in particular with was sufficient to maintain  eight  fellows to be added to those on the old foundation and two lectures every day one in the morning for the Old and another in the afternoon for the New Testament besides several other donatives to those of the house whom he had a particular esteem for  Now considering that he was the first Printer of that city and kingdom that he was invited thither by the college of  Sorbon  that he had been so great a master of his art and so liberal to that poor society in his lifetime and after his death the reader may perhaps expect to hear of some monument erected by them to his memory but 'tis plain from what  Chevillier  a fellow of that college tells us that they did not so much as set a gravestone over him to let the world know where that great man was bury'd so that our last mention'd author after a vast deal of pains could not gain the least certainty about it However to do them justice they order'd an anniversarymass to be said on the d of  August  on which he dy'd Who his correctors were is difficult to determine but it is probable he made use of any of the collegians whom he pleas'd He had some other partners besides  Maynyal  beforemention'd and instructed several Printers who signaliz'd themselves both during his life and after he dy'd There were likewise divers other Printinghouses set up at  Paris  soon after his of which we shall speak when we have given some further account of his works  Chevillier  in his list of  them divides them into three classes  viz  those which he printed with his two partners in the college from to next those printed at the  Golden Sun  in St  James'sstreet  'till  anno  and  lastly  those which he printed from that time 'till his death either by himself or with his other partners Of the first class there are  eleven  editions still extant all printed in the same character some of the first of which have epistles affix'd and inscrib'd by  Fichet  abovenam'd to several princes and prelates and are dated and one of which to cardinal  Bessarion  has the following  Aedibus Sorbonae scriptum impressumque uno anno septuagesimo quadringentesimo supra millesimum  those of the  second  class are in number and sixteen of the  third  class exclusive of those which he printed after the year all which the reader will find either in  Chevillier  or Mr  Mattaire Gering  's last work is dated which shews that he left off printing two years before he dyed for his death did not happen 'till  anno    Aug  The next Printinghouse to that of the three  Germans  last spoken of was set up by  PETER CAESARIS and JOHN STOL  THESE two Printers were likewise natives of  Germany  but had already studied sometime in the university of  Paris  where the former had attain'd to the degree of master of arts these two became acquainted with their countryman  Gering  and inform'd him of their design of setting up a Printinghouse begging his assistance and instructions therein which he readily granted and thus was the second Press set up at  Paris  by these two learned persons who became soon after no less famous for their industry and application than they had been for their learning They pitch'd upon one of the houses belonging to the college of  Sorbon  to print in which  Chevillier  tells us was in St  James'sstreet  at the sign of the  Soldier  and  Swan  their character was short of the beauty of  Uldric Gering  tho' far from being of the Gothic kind this may be one reason why a great many of their works are lost they were likewise guilty of neglecting to affix either their names or dates to their works so that the former is only to be gather'd from the likeness of the character to their  other works that are printed in their names and the latter is either supply'd by some circumstance or wholly guess'd at  THEIR first work is suppos'd to be the  Speculum Zamorae  which tho' printed without date yet is known to have come out  anno  by the epigram at the end one of their finest impressions is that of  Ocham's  decalogue which  Naudeus  thought to have been done by  Gering  but  Chevillier  who has compar'd them with other of their works assures them to have been printed by them we have but ten editions of theirs from to but they continu'd printing beyond that time especially  Caesaris  The next  Paris  Printer was  PETER CARON of whom we have but one edition dated  PASQUIER BONHOMME he printed the chronicle of  France  and that of St  Dennis  in three volumes  fol a scarce book  and the only one we have left of him it is dated  ANTHONY VERARD  HE was one of the most considerable Printers and booksellers of his time and very eminent for the curiosity and number of his ditions The greatest part of his books consist in romances and the like printed in a Gothic character but so elegant as to please the eve extremely Many of them are printed upon fine vellum  La Caille  tells us that there are above an hundred volumes of his romances printed curiously on vellum embellish'd with exquisite miniatures or small cutts painted in water colours in imitation of the manuscripts which he printed after all which are to be seen in the French king's library However tho' he engag'd most in romantick pieces yet he likewise publish'd several learned volumes all in  French  with equal care and beauty in the same Gothic letter  HE kept his Printinghouse and shop upon the bridge of  Nôtre Dame  at the sign of St  John  the  Evangelist  Sometimes he subscribes his books only with the first letters of his name A V His mark is enclos'd with four  French  verses in a pious strain the reader will find them in the margin  Pour proyoquer ta grand misericorde A tout pecheur faire Grace Pardon  Antoine Verard  humblement te recorde Tout ce qu'il a il fient de toy pardon  Whatever is become of the great number of his editions some of  which were printed by the  French  king  Charles  VIII's order I can find no more in  Orlandi  's list than from to  THE rest of the  Paris  Printers are as follows  NICHOLAS  de Philippis  and MARK REYNHARD  de

city of  Paris  with four  French  verses which you will find in the margin  Honneur an Roy a la Court  Salut a l▪ite  Dont nôtre bien procede sourt  Dieu gard de  Paris  la cite  we have however but

HIGMAN we have but edit of each of these dated  JOHN RICHARD we have but edit of each of these dated  JO PETIT  Parisian    JOHN PETIT was a native of  Paris  and rather a bookseller than a Printer he is justly esteem'd one of the most eminent and industrious ones of his time He kept the greatest number of the best workmen of any of his contemporaries with no less than fifteen presses continually at work at his own charges whilst himself was engag'd in the business of his shop at the  silver Lyon  and procuring the most skilfull correctors to revise his works He gain'd a prodigious reputation by the beauty and correctness of his impressions which tho' printed in a Gothic character are much esteem'd by the curious He began to print  anno  tho' some copies  of editions by several former Printers have likewise his name as Mr  Mattaire  informs us yet all have not he continued printing 'till  anno  and many of his impressions are as scarce as they are curious The learned  Henry Stephens  father of so many great Printers of that name was so well satisfy'd of his merit that he was glad to have him for his partner with  Wolfgang Hopyl  mention'd above who was a Printer of much older date  Petit  became so famous both for the beauty and correctness as well as the number of his editions that he was afterwards sworn Printer and bookseller to the university of  Paris  and chosen syndic or master of that company among those Printers which he employ'd was the famous  Jodocus Badius  who printed several considerable editions for him In the title page of his books he us'd the words  Petit a Petit by little and little  alluding to his own name which he also us'd for his motto The books which we finde printed in his name from to are only three the first of which is much valued by students in law  viz  MODUS  legendi abbreviaturus in utroque jure  vo per  Jo Petit Parisiis  For as we hinted before abbreviations were become so frequent and intricate in most sciences but especially that of the law that such a help as this was become absolutely necessary  JOHN DRYART we have but one impression of each of these dated  SIMON COLIN we have but one impression of each of these dated  GODFREY MARNEF we have but one impression of each of these dated  MICHEL TOLOSA edit  ALEXANDER ALIATE edit of each  THIELMAN KERVER edit of each  WE find also in  Orlandi  's list about editions without Printers names  BEFORE I dismiss this chapter I cannot omit observing that  Paris  hath been a noble patroness of the Art of Printing 'Tis true  Venice  is justly fam'd upon this account yet it ought to be remember'd that most of her celebrated Printers were of the  French  nation and signaliz'd themselves as much in this Art as any other nation and that  Paris  excell'd all other cities of that kingdom in this respect The encouragements which their kings and the learned of that and other countries have given the Art and the care of the university over the Printers have  contributed extremely to the great improvements made therein Besides this the  French  have shewn an extraordinary genius and skill in the cutting of their punches for all languages they have been very curious about their paper and more particularly in adorning their editions with cutts head and tail pieces initial letters rubricks and other embellishments of that nature This I mention not so much with respect to the th century as to the following No city has produc'd a greater number of the finest bibles than  Paris  Their large royal and polyglot bibles are justly esteem'd masterpieces of that kind their editions of general and provincial councils of canon and civillaw the works of the fathers chronological and historical books and in short in every art and science are very numerous rich and valuable and many of them contain seven eight and ten large volumes and some twenty thirty and even thirty seven as the acts of the council printed by the famous  Anthony Vitré  at the  Louvre  The women likewise were very eminent in this province and particularly  Charlotte Guillard  the widow of  Berthold Rembolt Ulric Gering  's partner who for the space of years kept several presses and printed a great number of large and correct editions both in  Latin  and  Greek  her best editions were publish'd after she became a widow the second time  viz  the bible the fathers in particular the works of St  Gregory  in two volumes were printed so accurately that the  errata  contain'd but three faults Her fame at last increas'd so that the learned  Lewis Lippoman  bishop of  Verona  made choice of her to print his  Catena SS patrum in Genesim  which he finish'd in  Portugal  This edition she perform'd so much to his satisfaction that when he assisted at the council of  Trent  he came on purpose to  Paris  to return her thanks and prevail'd upon her to print likewise his second volume  viz Catena in Exodum  which she perform'd with equal beauty and correctness These with many other particulars relating to that admirable woman may be seen in  Chevil  p  seq  As  Paris  has always abounded in excellent Printers and furnish'd most other cities of  Europe  with some of them so on the other hand it must be own'd that it has produc'd several equally bad who have publish'd many wretched editions and 'tis probable they might have still increas'd had not the university check'd their growth For as it has such power  over all Printers and booksellers as to refuse admitting those into the business who are not sufficiently qualify'd and to turn them out of it or suspend or fine them for any misdemeanors as was hinted before it can more easily restrain them than where such checks are wanting However those whose merit recommends them enjoy all the encouragement they can reasonably desire both from their princes and the university They are endow'd with privileges exemptions and immunities beyond any other city and have had frequent opportunities of raising themselves to great dignities of acquiring large estates and in short every thing suitable to their merit  CHAP V  The Settlement and Progress of  Printing  in the Cities of  Cologn Milan Strasburgh Bolognia  and  Treviso  the Names Dates and other Particulars of their  Printers  Article  I COLOGN  THE city of  Cologn  which is one of the most opulent Hanstowns in the empire and an archiepiscopal see pleasantly situated upon the  Rhine  by its nearness to  Mentz  must necessarily have receiv  d the Art of Printing very early We have taken notice in the first book of this history that some of  Faust  's servants left him even before the taking of that city and settled at  Cologn  and the author of the Chronicle of that name mentions it as the first city which receiv'd the art after  Mentz  'Tis unquestionable that if her first impressions had been preserv'd we must have given it the precedency to almost all the cities hitherto mention'd but whether the first printers of it neglected to add their own and the cities name at the end of their editions a fault too common in those days or whether their works were too inconsiderable to be preserv'd it is certain that there is no book as yet known printed there with an authentick date before this year which is  the reason why according to our propos'd method we can allow it no higher rank We have indeed in the introduction to this second book taken notice of one of the most eminent printers in this city  viz John Koelhoff  who antedated some of his impressions but I hope the reader is fully satisfy'd from the reasons which we have given there that he began not to work so early since one of his dates is even much older than either himself or the Art of Printing  Cologn  did not abound with great Printers during the first years  viz  till tho' in process of time it became very famous in that art as well by those who liv'd in it as those that dispers'd themselves into many cities of  Europe  It is call'd  Colonia Agrippina  in  Latin  from the empress  Agrippina Nero  's mother the following are all the Printers we know of 'till the end of the th century  CONRARD WINTERS  de Hombergh  a citizen of  Cologn  of whom we have but one edition dated  PETER  de Olpe  edit both  ARNOLD TERBORN or  Terburn  edit from to  JOHN KOELHOFF  de Lubeck  edit from to besides the two following ones which tho' printed with his name have a date manifestly false  FLORES  de diversis sermonibus epistolis  B Bernardi  per me  Joan Koelhoff  de  Lubeck Coloniensem  civem impressi anno  MCCCC  feliciter finiunt  The reader may see by the time in which he printed that either the last C must have been taken up by the balls or omitted by the compositor and that it was done  anno  or that some other figures are wanting to the date but it appears to me to be done by design rather than mistake  SILVII  Senensis Epistolae  at the end  Pii secundi pontificis maximi cui ante summum episcopatum primum quidem imperiali

false  HENRY QUENTEL an excellent Printer tho' omitted by the last annalist father  Orlandi  continued printing long after the year ▪ and had a son  Peter Quentel  and a grandson  John Quentel  who likewise distinguish'd themselves for the goodness and correctness of their editions we have but edit of his from to  JOHN GULDENSCHAYFF edit from to  MR  Mattaire  mentions likewise some bibles and a few other books printed here without Printers names  Article  II MILAN  MILAN in  latin Mediolanum  is one of the four chief cities of  Italy  situate near the rivers  Adda  and  Tesino  and said to have been built by the  Trojans  after their expulsion by  Bellover  king of the  Gauls  This city after a variety of chances and wars was almost ruined by  Frederic Barbarossa  but now flourishes under the emperor of  Germany  It received the Art of Printing very early and had many excellent artificers from the beginning whose works are equally valuable with those of any other cities We cannot positively affirm any thing concerning the time in which this Art was brought hither nor who were the men that set it up The first both in time as well as excellency was  ANTHONY ZAROT  HE was a native of the city of  Parma  tho' of  Cretensian  parents as appears by some of his colophons and gain'd a great reputation for years in which he continued printing by his elegant and correct impressions in a beautiful Roman character which are sufficiently known among the learned He was oblig'd indeed to comply with the custom in printing some editions in old Gothic yet even th  se have all the elegancy and beauty they can admit of He is esteem'd the inventor of signatures or alphabetical letters at the bottom of every sheet which  at first he plac'd under the last line of the page where they ought to be But afterwards he put them upon what account is hard to guess at the end of the last line so as to make them serve as it were for the last word in the page This appears by his edition of  John Simoneta de gestis Francisci Sfortiae ducis Mediol  anno This whim of his was not follow'd by any Printer nor by himself long for he soon return'd to the first method His main province was printing of classicks which he executed with extraordinary diligence and accuracy He is said to be the first that printed missals or massbooks for the use of the clergy who were hitherto us'd to MS ones That which he printed  anno  had the four  Latin  verses in red letters which you will find in the margin  Antoni patria Parmensis gente Zarote  Primus Missales imprimit atte Libros  Nemo repertorem nimium se jact  t in Arte  Addere plus tantum quam pepe  sse valet▪  His chief corrector was the famous  Peter Justin Philelphus  a person of learning and great application especially in correcting the faulty editions which  Zarot  was oblig'd to procure from  Rome  or other places His next corrector was the learned  P Steph▪ Dulcinio  prebend of  Scala  who tells the marquiss of  Palavicino  to whom he dedicates the second edition of  Manilius anno  that he had corrected that author in above three hundred places and clear'd it from the barbarisms and other faults of the transcribers as far as it was possible to be done in a very corrupt copy  Zarot  continued printing till the year from which time we hear no more of him  WE have twenty six of his impressions still extant many of which have either an epigram or a colophon in his commendation Some are without Printer or places name and even without date the last of which must be guess'd at the former are easily known by the particular beauty of his character and because he printed no where but at  Milan  PHILIP  de Lavagna Milanese  editions from to The last of which  viz Eusebii Chronicon  in  Latin  is without date and has a  Latin  epigram of six lines written in his commendation by  Boninus Mambritius  CHRISTOPHER VALDARFER  de Ratisbon  an excellent artist▪ who printed at  Venice  from to then came to  Milan  where  he wrought till  anno  if not beyond He made use of the same corrector here which he had at  Venice viz Ludovicus Carbo  or  Carbone  a native of  Ferrara  we have but four impressions of his done at  Milan  from to  DOMINIC  de Vespolate  edit from to  DIONYS PARAVICINO edit from to  THE former also took another partner  viz  JAMES MARLIAN of these we have edit  LUDOVIC  Piedmontese  and ALBERT  Piedmontese  Of these two Brothers we have only one edition  viz Dante's  comedies with comments The text is printed in an elegant Roman and the comments in a fine Gothic character with the colophon which you'll find in the margin  Edente Martino paulo Nidobeato Novariensi DIVA BO MA cum dulci nato JO GZ Ducibus feliciss Liguriae valida pace regnantibus operi egregio

were Germans by birth and printed sometimes together and sometimes separately till after the close of the th century The former of them printed a great many of the classicks and is reported to have

Milan  from to without Printer's names Fath  Orlandi  tells us that he has on purpose omitted many works done at  Milan  because his learned friend Dr  Joseph Antonio  keeper of the  Ambrosian  library in that city was then  ann  compiling a history which would shortly appear under the following title  Historia Literaria Mediolanensis ab an    ad    qua occasione de Origine progressu Typographiae Libris editis intra illud tempus ac Viris Illustribus eo seculo in eadem Urbe florentibus  By this we may easily guess that we have as yet but an imperfect history of that city We may say the same of almost all the rest except those that have met with some learned persons who have taken the pains of searching the libraries in order to give a more perfect and full one of them such as that of  Paris Nurembergh c  Article  III STRASBURGH  STRASBURGH in  Latin Argentina  and  Argentoratum  is an episcopal See and the metropolis of  Alsatia  upon the borders of  France  celebrated for the number of learned men which it has produc'd and the beauty and magnificence of its churches towers buildings  c  according to the poet's description  Imprimisque altas propius fert inclyta turres  Argentina Domus doctorum clara vi  orum    IT was the native place of  John Guttenbergh  to which after his disagreement with  Faust  he brought the Art of Printing together with some of his artificers so that it may be justly esteem'd at least one of the  first cities that practis'd it after  Mentz  tho' all the monuments of it are so far lost to us that we know not any books with a certain date printed there before the year  WE have seen in the first part of this history how much this city hath been celebrated by some authors upon the account of  John Guttenbergh  whom they suppos'd to have been the inventor of this Art or at least to have laid the first foundation of it here tho' he was oblig'd to retire to  Mentz  in order to perfect it But as this I conceive has been sufficiently confuted already it is unnecessary to repeat it here I have likewise given the reader an account of another controverfy in favour of  Strasburgh  and  John Mentel  started about two hundred years after the discovery of this Art by Dr  Mentel  of the university of  Paris  who asserted that his ancestor was the Inventor of Printing which discovery he was robb'd of by a treacherous servant whom he suspects to be our famous  John Faust  I hope I have fully exposed the vanity of this author's pretences and his unfaithfulness in quoting testimonies in behalf of  Mentel  against whom were there no other evidence it would be sufficient to allege that there is not one book printed in his name before the year  and that without any mention of the city of  Strasburgh  ALL that is proper to add at present is that our author to elude if possible the force of this objection affirm'd that this book which  John Mentel  finish'd  anno  was no less than twenty years a printing and contain'd ten large volumes in  fol  so that it must have been begun about  i e  four years before  Faust  had printed any work in his name but this is a groundless conjecture  THIS book is the  Speculum Morale  of  Vincentius Belvacensis  a very voluminous work but that it should have taken up years in printing is only said without any authority or testimony for it however we may allow it to have taken up some considerable time without lessening the validity of what has been heretofore affirm'd after several eminent authors  viz  that  John Faust  at his return from  Paris  where he had been selling his printed bibles for manuscripts stay'd some time at  Strasburgh  where he taught  Mentel  his Art The only difficulty against it is that if thi  last had been let into the secret so soon there would be some earlier and a greater number of his productions to be seen The former is  easily answer'd by the sad experience we have of too many of the old monuments of the Art being either lost or not yet discover'd and the latter  De la Caille  endeavours to account for who peremptorily asserts this  Mentel  to be the same with  John Mentelen  or  Manthen de Geretzsheim  who went and settled at  Venice  and associated himself with the famous  John de Cologne  one of the most eminent and first Printers of that city about the year with whom he printed several valuable editions mention'd in the chapter of  Venice  IF this assertion be well grounded 'tis superfluous to seek for any of his works at  Strasburgh  except the  Speculum  beforemention'd if even that was printed there But as  la Caille  has not mention'd his authority I shall not dare to assert the truth of this too positively We must not omit taking notice that this  John Manthen  continued printing at  Venice  with his partner aforesaid 'till the year as the reader may see by what has been said of him there whereas  John Mentel  is affirm'd by the Dr from the authority of  Gaspar Benegerus  to have dy'd at  Strasburgh  two years before  viz  in honour of whom the great bell of that city was order'd to be rung the sunday following  Obiit dominus  Johannes Mentel  sabatho post conceptionem virginis  Moriae an o  MCCCC LXX IIX et factus est  i pulsus cum campana magna Dominica sequenti Paraen c  pag      which is never done but upon the death of a prince or some very great man I shall not take upon me to decide the controversy but only say that if the  Speculum  aforesaid be  Mentel  's first edition at  Strasburgh  it will follow that he was outstript at least by two years there by the famous  Henry Eggelstein  of whom we have only two volumes both printed  anno  the last of which is perhaps one of the largest that ever was printed the paper of it being of an extraordinary size exceeding even that which is commonly call'd  Charta magna  It hath likewise another remarkable particular which is that the beginning and end of it are printed in red and is therefore the first edition done after that manner  THE Printers therefore of  Strasburgh  from to are as follows  HENRY EGGELSTEIN abovemention'd edit dated  JOHN MENTEL edit  viz Vincentii Speculum morale  in ten large  volumes  fol  and suppos'd to be printed at  Strasburgh  tho' no mention is made of the place where it was done it is dated  MARTIN FLACH or  Flachen  citizen of  Basil  edit from to  LEORIUS USNER citizen of  Strasburgh  edit from to  MARC REYNHARD of  Strasburgh  edit from to  and NICOL  de Philippis  of  Gernsheym  edit from to  JOHN PRUS edit  GEORGE REYNHARD or  de Grunynger  edit from to he had likewise printed at  Rome  as we have seen under that head  anno    ORLANDI has likewise given us a list of edit printed at  Strasburgh  without Printers names  Article  IV BOLOGNA  BOLOGNA or  Bolonia  in  Latin Bononia  an ancient and famous city of  Italy  at the foot of the  Alps  upon the river  Rhine  in the territories of the pope was formerly call'd  Felsina  from  Felsinus  king of the  Thuscans  which signifies a shield This name she preserv'd above nine hundred years and always was eminent for the number of learned men and brave warriers which she produc'd This city afterwards was call'd  Bojona  from  Buoi  king of the  Gauls  and in process of time  Bononia  and  Bolonia  It is at this day a celebrated university endow'd with extraordinary privileges from emperors popes  c  and such a concourse of students resort thither that it is recorded of one of their doctors and professors the learned  Azzo  that he was oblig'd to read his lectures in some publick market places to above ten thousand students For these and other reasons not necessary to be given here it has been styl'd  Archigymnasium mundi  and the mother and founder of universities  Bononia docet Mater studiorum  Petrus ubique Pater Legumque Mater  'Tis no wonder therefore that the Art of Printing receiv'd such early encouragement from it and that it had so many famous workmen eminent for the beauty and correctness of their impressions  IT is likewise observable that it had not the Art brought to it by foreigners as other famous cities  Rome Venice Paris  c but was oblig'd for it to one of her own citizens  viz  BALTHAZAR AZZOGUIDI  anno    A person well born and of good education who set up his Press in that city and continued printing at least till the year after which we hear no more of him His editions are all in a neat Roman character and printed with great accuracy the first of which  viz Ovid  's  Metamorphoses  anno has the colophon which you'll find in the margin  Balthessar Azzoguidi civis Bononiensis honestissimo loco natus primus in sua Civitate artis impressoriae Inventor ad Utilitatem Humani generis impressit A M CCCC LXXI  By which it is plain that he was the first who practis'd the Art of Printing of which he improperly calls himself the inventor in his own city of  Bolonia  We have editions of him from to  HUGO RUGERIUS of  Regio  edit from to  and DONINUS BERTOCH of  Regio  edit from to  DOMINIC  de Lapis  edit to  JOHN SCRIBER of  Ausburgh  call'd also JOHN  de Annunciata de Augusta  edit both  HENRY  de Colonia  edit from to  JOHN  de Noerdlingen  edit from to  and HENRY  de Harlem  edit from to THE last of these did likewise associate himself first with  MATH CRESCENTINUS  and afterwards with  JOHN WALBECK  so that of the editions abovenam'd were printed one with the former and two with the last  BALTHASSAR  de Hyruberia  edit both  DOMINIC  de Silvestro de Cini  edit  PLATO  de  BENEDICTIS or DEI BENEDETTI of  Bologna    This Printer hath never been excell'd by any person in the beauty and elegance of his Roman character and as his editions are extremely fine  and correct so he hath taken care to tell the world of it in almost every colophon at the end of his books by adding some pompous title to his name such as  impressor solertissimus artis hujus exactor probatissimus quam pulcherrimis Characteribus  c He is thought to have either learn'd the Art at  Venice  or furnish'd himself with his Fonts from thence The first is most probable because we find an edition of  Dion Chrysostom's Oratio de regno  to suppos'd to have been printed by him at  Venice anno  But  F Orlandi  thinks this supposition illgrounded and therefore hath mention'd neither him nor that edition under the article of  Venice  but has put it at the head of those printed by him at  Bologna  where having found a book printed  anno  intitled  Baptistae Mantuani Carmelitani parthenices  he reprinted it with his own name and colophon All his impressions as yet known the two foremention'd ones included amount to sixteen the last of them  viz Vegetius  and others  de Re Militari  is dated  BENEDICT HECTOR  He was a very good Printer and Bookseller who employ'd many Printers of this city and kept likewise some presses of his own agoing as appears by those impressions we have of him all which are so correct and beautiful that he is justly rank'd among the best workmen of his time and  Ugerius de Pontremulo  has honour'd some of his impressions with epigrams in praise of him We have four and twenty of them still extant from to  BACILIERUS or  de Bacilieris       BASSALERUS or  de Bassaleris       BAZALERUS or  de Bazaleris    WE have but three editions of this Printer from to in each of which he spells his name differently He was an excellent Printer and a rival of the famous  Plato de Benedictis  whom he endeavour'd to surpass in beauty of letter finess and accuracy of his impressions which tho' they do not excel yet are not at all inferior to those of his corrival and he doth not fail accordingly to give himself some of these pompous epithets which we have seen of the other and it is observ'd that some of  Plato's  impressions were no sooner come out of the press but  Bacilierus  went immediately to work upon them and publish'd another  edition in a small time after Such an emulation could not chuse but have proved an honour and service to the Art had it liv'd till now  JOHN JAMES FONTANESE  edit both dated  HECTOR FAELLI  Bolognese  edit from to  HERCULES NANI  edit from to  JUSTINIAN  de Ruberia  edit from to  JOHN ANTONY  Platonides Benedictorum Bolognese  edit With a small number printed at  Bologne  without the Printers names  Article  V  The City of  TREVISO  TREVISO in  Latin Tarvisium  a noble and ancient city of  Italy  and the capital of the province of that name by reason of its vicinity to  Venice  under whose dominion it is had the Art of Printing soon introduc'd  Gerard de Lisa  a  Flemming  by birth and an excellent Printer was the first that set it up here We can only say in general both of him and this city that the few editions we have left of theirs are very elegant and in a neat character  GERARD  de  LIZA  or  LISIS  or  GERARD  de  FLANDRIA  WE have but four editions of him the two first are dated the third and the last which makes me hope that more of them will still come to light these being esteem'd very curious not only for their elegancy but likewise for their correctness  HERMAN LICHTHENSTEIN  or  LEVILAPIS  of  COLOGN  THIS Printer we have spoken of under the chapter of  Venice  and we shall again mention him under the city of  Vincenza  where he printed for some time At  Treviso  we have only two editions printed by him both dated He died  anno  whilst he was printing that voluminous work of  Vincentius  entituled  Speculum Morale  BERNARD  de Colonia  edit  MICHEL MANZOLI or MANZOLINI edit from to  BARTHOLOMEW  de Confoloneriis  edit from to

BERTOCH edit  DIONYS BERTOCH edit  and PEREGRINE PASQUALI edit  THERE is scarce one Printer to be met with in history who chang'd oftner his place of abode his partners and even his name than  Dennis Bertoch  who sometimes calls himself  Bertoch Doninus  and sometimes  Dionys  sometimes  de Bononia  and at other times  de Regio  His first works  viz  for to were printed at  Treviso  immediately after which we find him at  Venice  where he stay'd till thence he remov'd to  Regio  and associated himself with  Marc Antony de Baccilieris  and lastly he settled at  Modena  about the year We find but two of their impressions under this head dated and  BUT tho' we have rank'd them under the article of  Treviso  yet they bear no name of any place and may indeed be suppos'd done by them at  Venice  where they printed about this time however I have chosen to follow  F Orlandi  who thinks it more probable that they were done at  Treviso  THERE is an edition printed by  Peregrine Pasquali  at  Scandiano  near the city of  Reggio  but with a date impossible to be understood or guess'd at  IT is as follows  DILIGENTIS  ac ingeniosi calchographi Peregrini Pasquali exactissimâ tum operâ tum curâ haec Candidi ex Apiano historico sophista traductio Scandiani Camillo comite impressa est  Anno a natali Christi M CCCC LCXV  Appendix to the foregoing chapter Printing set up at  Ratisbon Amberg  and  Colle  THESE three cities tho' distant from each other we have join'd together at the end of this chapter for the sake of the editions printed at each of them in the same year which were too few to deserve a distinct article since we meet with no impressions at either of them except the four following  viz  AT  Ratisbon  an imperial city in  Germany  upon the  Danube Servii comment in Virgilium  fol without the Printer's name  Orl  AT  Amberg  in the  Palatinate  now subject to the elector of  Bavaria Marc Tull Cicer Orationes omnes  fol without the Printer's name  Orl  AT  Colle

Verona Parma Mantua Derventer  and  Padua  anno    a List of the Printers and their Works with other particulars till    Article  I  The City of  NAPLES  NAPLES in  Latin Neapolis  and  Parthenope  is the metropolis of the kingdom of that name in  Italy  It was formerly govern'd by kings of its own but afterwards became subject to the crown of  Spain  and is  now under the emperor of  Germany  This city has been the residence of men of the most distinguish'd wit and learning in ancient and modern ages as  Virgil  who is said to have writ his Georgicks here  Livy Horace Claudian Petrarck Bocatellus Panormitanus Laurentius Valla  the great restorer of latinity and eloquence  Perillus  an elegant  Italian  poet and many others of conspicuous merit The great number of learned men in this city particularly when printing became known and spread itself over  Europe  was a sufficient inducement for some of the best Printers to settle there But none encourag'd the Art and artists more than  Ferdinand  III king of  Naples  whom we had occasion to mention before upon the account of the free access which the learned had to his person and their epistolary correspondence with him and who liv'd at the time of the infancy of the Art As his learning was equal to the esteem he had for the learned I doubt not but it was he who procur'd the famous  Sixtus Russinger  a learned and pious priest who was a native of  Strasburgh  to settle in his capital This seems more than probable not only because he was the first who set up a press at  Naples  but from the great marks of esteem which that prince shew'd him insomuch that having discover'd his intention to return to his own country he try'd all possible means to divert him from it and even offer'd him a noble bishoprick or any other preferment if that could have fix'd him in his dominions But this venerable old man whether out of modesty or rather a desire of spending the small remainder of his days in his native city refus'd the king's offer and return'd home loaden with the presents of that generous monarch  Riessinger  was not only a Printer but a clergyman and famous for his great learning yet as he continued but a short time at  Naples  we have few editions of his  Orlandi  gives him a contemporary and fellow citizen  viz Peter  of  Strasburgh  who settled there about the same year but as I do not find that he printed any thing in company with  Riessinger  or that any of his impressions are left I shall say no more of him  WE have but four impressions of  Sixtus Russinger  or  Riessinger  two dated  anno  and the other two without date They are all curious and correct and two of them have  Latin  epigrams at the end  in his commendation We don't find that he carried on the business after he came again to his native place  BARTHOLD RING of  Strasburgh  edit  MATTHIAS MORAVUS  de Olumuntz  edit from to  THE first of whose impressions  viz Seneca  's works is remarkable for its wrong date MLXXV for MCCCCLXXV We find likewise an impression of his done at  Genoa  in company with  Michael de Monacho  viz  Supplementum Summae quae pisanella vocatur  fol Januae Cal  Julii millesimo quadringentesimo  LII quarto  instead of  LXX quarto his corrector was  Junianus Majus  a  Neapolitan  and a professor of grammar and rhetorick who publish'd the following edition  Justiniani Maii Parthenopei liber de priscorum proprietate verborum  fol with this colophon  Impressere Matthias Moravus impressor solertissimus venerabilis Monachus Blasius Theologus  which book has been much esteem'd and reprinted in many places  ARNOLD  de Bruxella  or  Brussels  edit from to  JOHN ADAM  de Polonia  edit  CONRARD GULDEMUND edit  FRANCIS  de Dino  of  Florence  edit to He went afterwards to  Florence  where we shall find him under that head  AYOLF  de Canthono  citizen of  Milan  edit  THIS piece which is known but by few is intitled  L' Aquita  and was compos'd in  Latin  by  Leonard Aretino  and by him translated into  Italian  It consists of four books the first treats of the origin of the world and the offspring of  Jupiter  The second of the departure of  Aeneas  from  Troy  and of the kings of  Italy  The third of the actions and sayings of  Julius Caesar  And the fourth of the descendants of  Julius Caesar  THERE are many others done here without Printer's name  Article  II  The City of  FLORENCE  FLORENCE the metropolis and seat of the dukes of  Tuscany  and a noble university was not oblig'd to foreigners for this Art since it was brought within her gates by one of her own citizens  Bernard Cennini  We do not find that he went to any other city in order to learn it but being a considerable goldsmith and having two sons  viz Dominic  and  Peter  who were very ingenious artificers and the latter a person of letters they set themselves about cutting of punches sinking of matrices and in short got the whole apparatus of a Printinghouse made within their house insomuch that they were in a capacity of printing before the year The first book and only one we have left which is the reason why he has been unknown to all our annalists till  F Orlandi  was  Virgil's  works with  Servius's  commentaries which they began to print on the th of  November  and finish'd  October  the th The preface and colophon of this not only giving an account of their ingenuity and diligence but containing likewise something remarkable I shall refer the original to the margin and insert it here in  English  The book is printed in the father and his son  Dominic's  name and  Peter  the other

in the opinion of all men and  Dominic  his son a youth of an extraordinary genius having first made their steel punches and afterwards cast their letters from them printed this their first work  Peter Cenninus  another son of the said  Bernard  hath us'd his utmost care in correcting it as you see it  Nothing is too bard for a Florentine genius  FINIS  "  And after  The colophon runs thus  "BERNARD CENNINUS a most excellent goldsmith  c as in the last  and  Dominic  his son a youth  c  printed this book  Peter  the son of the same  Bernard  corrected it having first compar'd it with the most ancient manuscripts It was his first care that nothing should pass under the name of  Servius  but what was truly his or any thing that was plain from the most ancient copies to be his might be maim'd or wanting But because many persons choose to write the  Greek  quotations with their own hands and there are but few to be met with in the old copies and their accents cannot be printed but with great difficulty he thought proper to leave blank spaces for them But as man can produce nothing absolutely perfect it will be sufficient for us if these books be sound as we heartily wish more correct than any other"  THE work was finish'd on the Nones of  October  at  Florence  FR DOMINIC  de Pistoria Monks    and FR PETER  de Pisa Monks    THERE are some  Florence  editions with this inscription  Apud sanctum Jacobum de Ripoli  which have given  F Orlandi  no small trouble to discover the Printers who liv'd near that place at length he found that it was a cloister of  Dominican  fryers who liv'd in a little convent upon the plain of  Ripoli  without St  Nicholas  's gate at  Florence  near which place he found four editions the first of which is printed with the abovemention'd  Monk  's name as follows  Improntata in Firenze al Monasterio di santo Jacopo di Ripoli del'Ordine del Fratri Predicatori per Mano di dua religiosi Frate Dominico da Pistoja e Frate Piero da Pisa  Firenze The other three mention only the name of the place  Impress apud sanctum Jacobum de Ripoli  The second and third are dated the last is without date  NICOLAS ALLEMANUS or  Nicolas de Lorenzo Dallamagna  and  Della Magna  edit from to  NICOLAS  de Brestaw  edit  ANTONIUS BARTHOLOMAEI  Miscomini  edit from to  FRANC  de Dino  of  Florence  edit  THIS Printer work'd at  Naples  about the year as we have seen before after which he remov'd to  Florence  and printed the abovemention'd editions the first of which wants the place's name but is reasonably suppos'd to have been printed there rather than at  Naples  because its character is different from that us'd at the latter  ANTONIUS FRANCISCI  Venetian  edit  DEMETRIUS CALCONDILLA MILANESE  a native of Crete    HE was a person of admirable skill in the  Greek  and  Latin  tongues and at first a corrector of the press but afterwards he turn'd Printer first at  Florence  and then at  Milan anno  where we have mention'd him under that article The only book known to have been printed by him at  Florence  is a beautiful edition of  Homer  in  fol  of which I have seen two copies It is printed in a fine  Greek  character with a large margin and distance between the lines and considering that it was the first volume printed in  Greek  is a very curious and valuable piece and bears the following title  HOMERI

BARTHOLOMEW P  Florentine  edit  LAURENCE FRANCISCI  de  ALOPA  Venetian    THIS was a very ingenious and famous Printer both in the  Greek  and  Latin  tongues  Jo Andreas Lascaris  a noble  Grecian  and one of the most distinguish'd criticks and poets of that time designing to revive as much as possible the study of those languages especially of the  Greek  chose this  Laurence  for his Printer and corrected his copies 'Tis remarkable that his editions in the  Greek  are all printed in fine capitals throughout the use of which was till then unknown if we except four or five to be met with in some old impressions and manuscripts Mr  Mattaire  hath given us a short specimen of the first of these curious editions with the preface of  Lascaris  in  Latin  capitals likewise interspers'd with  Greek  words the figures and letters of which as well as the number of words in each line and of the lines in each page answer exactly to those of that edition He hath added some remarks upon them which the curious reader may find in his  Annales Typograph  from p to We have five editions of his all in  Greek  the first and second are dated and the rest are without date  LAURENCE MORGIANI edit

the Exarch of  Ravenna  it was made an university by the Emperor  Ferdinand  II and has always bee  famous for men of learning and valour and for ingenious artificers  An  it past from the dominion of the Marquesses of  Este  to that of the  Popes of  Rome  under which it has continu'd ever since hither the Art of Printing was brought by one of its own citizens  viz  ANDREAS GALLUS  IT appears by the colophon to his first impression which you will find in the margin  Impressi  Andreas  hoc opus cui  Francia  nomen  Trdaidit at civis  Ferrariencis  ego  c  that he was either a  Frenchman  or of  French  extraction tho' a citizen of  Ferrara  which last might be bestow'd on him upon the account of his being the first person who set up his press there the like encouragement having been given by many other cities to their first Printers but whether he brought it thither from some other place or devis'd it at home as  Cennini  did at  Florence  is neither easy nor very material to guess he was a good Printer and his editions are still esteem'd by the curious  WE have but twelve of them extant from  ann  to  THE rest of the Printers of  Ferrara  are as follows  CARNERIUS AUGUSTINUS whose father  Bernard Augustinus  was a bookseller of the same city We have four editions of his from to one of which  viz Boccacio  in  Italian  is the first poem printed in that language it has neither date nor name of Printer or place but the character shews it to be  Augustines  SEVERUS of  Ferrara  edit  SEVERINUS bookseller of  Ferrara  but whether this and the former be the same or father and son is uncertain we have but one edition of his  viz Alberti Trotti de vero perfecto Clerico  to in which he writes himself  per Severinum Bibliopolam Ferrariensem  This edition  Orlandi  tells us was afterwards reprinted at  Lyons ann  with a  Latin  preface importing that it was about seventy years since  Severinus  bookseller had publish'd it at  Ferrara  by which it would appear that he had printed it  ann  even before either that city or even  Rome  had receiv'd the Art our author therefore guesses the mistake to be in the word  septuagesimus annus  which he thinks was printed instead of  sexagesimus  which last brings it almost to the very time  THE fifth and last Printer was  Laurence Rossi  or  Rubeus  of whom we have editions from to  THERE are a few more without Printers names the last of which is the history of Pope  Joan  in  Italian    Article  I  The City of  NUREMBERGH  NUREMBERGH or  Norimbergh  in  Latin Norimberga  is a free city in  Germany  upon the confines of  Swabia Franconia  and  Bavaria  situate upon the river  Pegnitz  It was formerly a democratical commonwealth but upon some domestick sedition it reduc'd itself to an aristocracy in the reign of the emperor  Charles  IV under the government of twenty four senators chosen out of so many of their ancientest families which form of government hath been continued ever since The city is very rich large and populous surrounded with a double wall above eight miles in circuit and lofty towers It was always celebrated for producing the best artificers in every kind of handicraft and particularly for a beautiful metal of their own making call'd  Nurembergh  copper the composition of which was kept with all imaginable secrecy within their walls every workman being first sworn to it so that the metal was almost equally dear with silver till about the latter end of the last century one of their own citizens came over and sold the secret here in  England  which has made it more common and consequently lessen'd the price of it This metal I purposely chuse to mention because it was reckon'd very excellent for making of matrices being far more ductile than the common copper and not so apt to break the punches  IT will be no easy matter to fix the time when the Art of Printing was brought to this city  John Andreas Endlers  a Printer of  Nuremberg  who publish'd a piece on Printing in  High Dutch anno  and in it has given us an account of its progress in that city acquaints us that he had met with some MS annals which affirm that the Art was no sooner found out at  Mentz  but it was immediately communicated to  Nuremberg  which did therefore receive it about the year according to one or according to another 'Tis true our author is so far from being satisfy'd with their account that he has even taken the pains to confute them from more authentic testimonies however tho'  I do not design to enter into a detail of that dispute yet I could not forbear mentioning thus much because it serves to confirm a former observation  viz  that not only the Printers but likewise the  Cities  themselves have taken no small pains to antedate their respective claims to this Art  I have already taken notice in the first part of this history  pag  that the discovery of the Art of Printing had been attributed by  Purbach  and  Peter Ramus  to that learned mathematician and astronomer  John de Monte regio  or  RegioMontanus  and mention'd  Manilius  's astronomy printed by him without date or places name Our  German  author acquaints us upon the authority of  Gassendi  one of the  French  royal mathematicians  "that  Regiomontanus  came to  Nuremberg  about  anno  with a design to set up a Printinghouse there in order to print his own works and those of other learned men with greater accuracy and speed and to improve the Art of Printing in several of its branches but that he met with so many obstacles to his design that he saw himself forc'd to make use of foreign Printinghouses such as they were till one  Bernard Walter  offer'd to bear the charges of erecting a Printinghouse for him as he likewise did towards many other curious inventions of his and enabled him to print  Purbac  's new theory  Manilius  's astronomy and his own  Ephemerides  for the use of the publick"  OUR author observes further that as this account of  Gassendi  's doth quite overturn  Peter Ramus  's supposition of  Regiomontanus  being the inventor of the art so it likewise shews him to have contributed much towards the improvement of it It likewise proves that there were some Presses in this city before he came thither but who they were that set them up and what works they printed before that time is what he has not been able to find out because they have no dates or Printer's names  THE oldest book he could find with a date is the  Commestorium Vitiorum  of  Francis de Retza  a  Dominican Fryar  at the end of which are the words which you'll find in the margin  Hic Codex egregius Comestorii vitiorum sacre Theologie Professoris eximii  Francisci  de  Retza  Ordinis predicatorum finit feliciter  Nuremberge anno  LXX  o  Patronarum formarumque Concordia proportione impressus  with this odd date  LXX  o    which our author seems to take for This book was afterwards reprinted by  Ant Koburger anno  and afterwards  anno  under the following title  Summa quae destructorium vitiorum nominatur  without Printer's name  The author mentions another book of the same date  viz Gerson  chancellour of  Paris Commentarium super sapientis hebrei cantica  c but as neither of these have the Printer's name we shall seek somewhere else for the first Printer of  Nuremberg  According therefore to our propos'd method of the oldest edition known that rank will fall upon  ANTONY KOBURGER  A person eminent for learning and the number elegancy and correctness of his editions which gain'd him the title of the prince of Printers among the learned of his time At first indeed his character tho' of the  Venetian  sort was somewhat imperfect and inferior to that of many of his cotemporaries but he afterwards procur'd a new sett which hath been justly esteem'd ever since as fine as any that have been us'd either before or after him He was no less solicitous in correcting his works so that tho' he was alone sufficient for that task yet he took the learned  Frederic Pistorius  for his assistant He spar'd no cost nor pains in procuring the best manuscripts and always desir'd the judgment of the learned before he ventur'd to print them The great  Jodocus Badius  hath made this short but just panegyric upon him in a letter written to him  anno  and printed at the beginning of the works of  Angelus Politianus anno    Litteratos omnes colis foves pervigilemque curam ad bonos codices vere terse sine mendis imprimendos adhibes  That he was a great friend and lover of the learned and indefatigable in printing the best copies faithfully neatly and correctly Mr  Mattaire  hath given us an extract of this letter in his  Annales Typogr  p by which the reader may see what esteem this great man was in not only among the learned but likewise among the best Printers of his time and it may be said of him that he printed more works than any of them particularly bibles of which the reader  will find no less than editions still extant one of which is in another in volumes in folio and a third with fine wooden cuts  HE was no less diligent in printing other works and we are told by  John And Endters  "That he kept daily twenty four presses at work and employ'd no less than an hundred journeymen whom he maintain'd without doors they had a set hour to come to work and to leave off and he admitted none single into his house but oblig'd them to wait at his door till they were altogether and then they were admitted in and enter'd upon their respective works  HE was likewise a considerable Bookseller and kept a spacious printinghouse at  Lyons  in  France  where he had sundry lawbooks printed for him besides this he had his factors and agents in the most considerable cities in  Christendom  and kept sixteen open shops beside warehouses and in all of them a considerable stock of the best books then extant so that he never was at a loss for any good editions to supply his customers with"  THUS he continued printing both at  Nuremberg  and at  Lyons  with great success and applause till the year if not beyond however we don't find any edition of his of a more recent date which makes me believe that he left off printing about that time In  James Sachon  one of his workmen at  Lyons  printed  Castellanus  's  Latin  bible for him with this colophon  Lugduni per Jacobum Sachon expensis Antonii Koburger  The same is likewise dated from  Nurembergh  but is suppos'd to be the same edition with that of  Lyons  he dy'd in this year after having been for some time a member of the chief council of  Nuremberg  all the editions that we have of him his bibles inclusive from to amounts to but thirty seven a number too inconsiderable for the many presses and workmen that he kept which gives me room to hope that time will discover a great many more  MR  Mattaire  p tells us of one  Adam  of  Amberg  the metropolis of the  Bavarian  palatinate who flourish'd  ann  but doth not tell us where he wrought Our German author says that he had met with a small treatise in to of a sheet and half with his name and the city of  Nurembergh  at the end so that he most probably resided there but tho' this work be without date yet his edition of  Cicero  's  Orationes  printed  ann  tho' without places name may be so far presum'd to be done here as to allow him the next place after  Koburger  THE rest of the Printers of this city are as follows  FREDERIC CREUSNER edit from to  JOHN SENSENSCHMID of  Eger  HENRY KOLER of  Mentz    and ANDREW FRISNER  de Wunsiedel    KOLER was a native of  Mentz  and in all likelyhood one of  Faust  's servants who left that city soon after it was taken and took sanctuary at  Nuremberg  THE last of these  viz Frisner  after having been corrector and assistant to  John Sensenschmid  till set up a Printinghouse himself which appears from many of his books which bear his name as Printer and editor He had study'd for some time in the university of  Leipsick  with a relation of his  Erasmus Frisner  a Dominican Fryar who tho' but twenty seven years of age had compos'd several books the printing of which he committed to his kinsman  Andrew  who printed them some time after at  Nurembergh  where he dwelt as appears by several of his books from till after this having taken his degree of master of arts he remov'd again to  Leipsick  where he was soon after chosen professor of divinity and attain'd even to the honour of  Rector Magnificus  of that university to which place he got all his Printingtools convey'd he went from thence to  Rome  where pope  Julius  II made him  Papae sedis apostolicae primarius ordinarius  By his last will which he made at  Rome ann  he left a noble legacy for the erection of a college at  Wonsiedel  for the education and maintenance of young students of the family of the  Frisner  's which they enjoy to this day he left them also his  Historia Lombardica  which he had printed whilst at  Leipsick  He likewise bequeath'd all his printing materials to the convent of the dominicans of  Leipsick  and expresses himself thus  Item I leave my iron chest presses instruments and other utensils and materials for printing together with twenty florens rhenish to pray for my soul and for buying the monks a better dinner than they us'd to have in the Prior's refectorythe day when they perform my  bsequies  WHAT use the monks made of the Printingpress  c  I can no where find we have but four editions printed by the aforesaid three partners from to  CONRARD LENTORIUS We have but one  Latin  Bible with the apostills of  Nich de Lyra  fol  GEORGE STUCHS or  Flucks de Sultzbach  we have but one missal of his adorn'd with rubricks  GASPAR HOCHFEDER our German author calls him  Hochfelder  edit and  WITH about more without Printers names  MR ENDTERS mentions some other Printers before but as he gives us no account of their works we shall say no more of them  BEFORE I leave the city of  Nuremberg  I cannot but take notice that it is also famous for being the native place and constant residence of the great Painter Engraver Mathematician and Printer  Albert Durer  MARK ANTONIO  Raphael  's learned engraver gives him this character speaking of his skill in engraving and of his other excellent talents  "That if so excellent so exact and so universal a genius had been cultivated in  Tuscany  instead of  Germany  and had form'd his study according to the excellent pieces which he might have seen at  Rome  as the rest of our celebrated painters have done he would have prov'd the best in that respect that  Italy  ever produc'd as he really was the greatest and most accomplish'd genius that  Germany  could ever boast of"  THIS great man was born  ann  His father observing the early marks of his genius to all the liberal sciences spar'd no cost to have it improv'd by all possible means travelling excepted and by the best masters in  Germany  But tho' his other talents have been highly celebrated by the learned yet I never met with any who took notice of his having been a printer no not even his countryman and fellowcitizen author of a Piece on the Subject of Printing c in  Nuremberg  mentioned in the beginning of this article tho' several of his works are preserv'd in divers libraries both publick and private I have seen some of them  very beautiful nor do I doubt but that his genius for painting and engraving led him to the other two branches of cutting upon wood and Printing that he might be able to perform the whole work himself without the danger of having any part of it spoil'd by unskilful hands and the better to print the descriptions of his cuts  c  in a more elegant manner than cou'd possibly be done in wood His improvement in the art of engraving or cutting upon wood was carried by him to its utmost perfection as all persons must own who have seen any of his works  The part of shadowing which is call'd crosshatching and which has been lost for many years and conducted if not wholly invented by him with such extraordinary beauty and truth join'd to the uncommon lustre of his ink has surpass'd all the woodcutters ever since His reason for preferring this method of cutting on wood to that of copper plates were The roulingpress which is wholly us'd in the later was not then so perfect as since His most considerable works of which he was the author for he scarce printed any other being chiefly geometry perspective fortification and architecture as well as history wooden cutts were much the more eligible method upon several accounts especially when cut by such a masterly hand as his The only difficulty was to make it subservient to his historypieces but that he easily surmounted by the strength of his genius and those who have seen any of his performances even in this kind will readily own that nothing of that nature ever equall'd them His usual mark was the initial letters of his name AD joyn'd together thus  Albert Durer's printer's mark  but his most effectual way to prevent counterfeits was by giving his works a degree of beauty never yet attain'd to  WITH respect to his Printing I have already hinted that he seldom meddled with any works but his own as I can find but as I have met with none done before the year tho' he probably entred into that province before that time I shall not trouble the reader with a list of them but content my self with subjoining an account of a few of the most considerable which I have seen They are esteem'd by the learned masterpieces of the kind and preserv'd as monuments of the author's merit being as follow  THE history of the  Apocalypse  consisting of a fine set of draughts upon that subject all cut upon wood with his own hand and with the utmost beauty and truth  The history of the  four gospels  done after the same manner and with the same beauty Both these sets are printed with the common press with explanations and historical accounts of the designs placed either under them or on the other side or upon a distinct leaf They are both in  fol  His book of proportions which he did not live to finish but was printed by his widow after his death is likewise esteem'd another masterpiece in that kind I shall only add that the singular beauty of his ink the excellency of the Press work and in a word the exactness of his performances do justly rank him amongst the greatest genius's of the age I hope therefore the reader will excuse this digression in favour of a person to whom the world owes the great improvements made in the art of cutting upon wood which has been so serviceable to the Printers in the ornamental part of their works  Article  V  The City of  VERONA  VERONA an ancient city in  Lombardy  famous for some noble relicks of the old  Roman  architecture such as amphitheatres triumphal arches  c  which still retain some part of their former magnificence is likewise remarkable for having been the native place of several eminent persons in particular of  Cornelius Nepos Emilius Maurus Pliny Vitruvius Guarini  and others It receiv'd the Art of Printing very soon yet made but small advantage of it We find very few Printers in it and we have but a small number of their works left The first of them was  JOHN  de  VERONA  WHO was a native of  Verona  and son to  Nicolas  a doctor of physic and the first who set up a Printingpress in that city as appears by the  colophon of the only book extant of his  viz Valturius de re militari liber  fol  per Jo Veronens Veronae  Joannes ex Verona oriundus Nicolai  yrurgiae Medici filius Artis impressoriae Magister hunc de Re Militari librum Literis figuratis signis in sua Patria primus impressit M CCCC LXXIII  anno  FELIX ANTIQUARIUS we have but edit of theirs dated  INNOCENT ZILETI we have but edit of theirs dated  PETER MAUFER  PETER MAUFER was a Frenchman and an excellent Printer The first place where he set up his press was the city of  Padua  about as we shall shew in its proper place Thence he came to  Verona  in and after a short stay there went to  Venice  in and associated himself with  Nicol Contengo  as mention'd in the chapter of that city We have only the following book printed by him here  JOSEPHI  opera Latinè Ludovico Contrada interprete  fol  per Petrum Maufer Gallicum  oct cal Jan pont max Sixto Venetorum duce Joanne Mocenigo  in inclytâ civitate Veronae    BONINO  de  BONINI  de  RAGUSIO  WHO printed at first in the city of  Venice  with  Andreas de Paltasichis anno  whence he remov'd to  Verona  and at last to  Brescia  where he continued printing much longer we have but three of his editions done at  Verona  and  PAUL FRIDENPERGER of  Passaw  in  Germany  edit with a small number without Printer's names  Article    The City of  PARMA  PARMA is another ancient city in  Lombardy  call'd by the Romans  Gallia Cisalpina  situate in a very pleasant large plain and so well furnish'd with pasture ground that it is recorded by  Martial  for the great number of cattel it bred  Tondet innumeros Gallica Parma greges  It  was once under the pope's government and given by  Paul  III to his nephews with the title of dukes of  Parma  under whom it has continu'd ever since Tho' this city receiv'd the Art of Printing so early as the year yet it had but very few artificers and a small number of editions printed there It may indeed be reasonably suppos'd that these being so much inferior to those of  Venice Rome Paris c  have been mostly destroy'd and the same may be said of many other cities However  Parma  deserves to be remember'd if not for the number and excellency of her Printers yet for having given birth to some of the greatest of that time who were perhaps for want of sufficient encouragement here oblig'd to settle in other parts of  Italy  Among these were the famous  Antony Zarot  who printed at  Milan  a great many fine and correct volumes as we have shewn under that article  Fausto Vincenzo  and  Pellegrino del Bonardi  and  Bartholomew de Parma  in  Bolognia  and  Matthew Capcasa  in  Venice Mich Manzoli  in  Treviso  with many more whose name and place of birth  c  the reader will find in the article of each of those cities The first book we meet with printed here is the works of the famous lawyer  Baldus  but hath no Printer's name tho' it is dated at  Parma ann  However 'tis probable it was printed by  Stephen Corali  a native of  Lyons  who is the first in our list and printed or rather might reprint the same work the year following  STEPHEN CORALI edit from to  AUGUSTINE GENOENSIS or of  Genoa  edit  ANDREA PORTILIA edit from to  ANGELO UGOLETTI  de Parma  edit from to  AND near twenty more without Printers names  Article  VII MANTUA  MANTUA one of the most ancient cities of  Lombardy  situate in the middle of an island form'd by the river  Mincio  had its name and origin from  Manto  daughter of  Tiresias  a Theban augur she bore a son call'd  Ocnus  who built a city near the river  Po  and from his mother's name call'd it  Mantoa  or  Mantua  After a great variety of changes it is now subject to the house of  Austria  It has given birth to many learned men  both ancient and modern and particularly to the immortal  Virgil  This city cannot boast of any great merit with respect to the Art of Printing except that it was brought thither  ann  by some  Germans  who came to settle there but as it is probable for want of encouragement were oblig'd to remove We find but four of these Printers at the most and at a considerable distance of time from each other Of the two first we know but one edition and two of each of the rest as will appear from the following list  GEORGE and PAUL  Germans  edit  PAUL JOHN  de Burschbach  of the diocess of  Mentz  who was perhaps the same with  Paul German  the latter of the two foregoing who takes now the name of his native town instead of that of his nation edit  VINCENT BERTOCH of  Reggio  edit and some others which have no Printers names  Article  VIII  The City of  DERVENTER  DERVENTER in  Latin Daventria  in  lower Germany  near the river  Issel  upon the confines of  lower Gelderland  near the city of  Utrecht  began to practise the Art of Printing  ann  The st impression done here  viz Prudentius Aurelius Poeta Hispanus his poems  to has no Printer's name but is dated  Daventriae    RICHARD PAFRADIUS edit  JAMES  de Breda  edit from to with about twenty more without Printers names  Article  IX  The City of  PADUA  PADUA or  Padova  in  Latin Patavia  or  Patavium  so call'd by  Antenor  the fi  st founder of it in compliment to his companions who were  Paphlagonians  and for whose sakes he call'd it by the name of their metropolis is a rich ancient and noble city upon the river  Brento  and now under the government of the  Venetian  republick famous for its hot baths and mineral waters and resorted to from all parts of  Europe  It  is one of the last cities we know of that receiv'd this Art in the year in which tho' it was not very eminent either for the number of Printers or impressions yet it publish'd several curious editions which had not as yet appear'd in any of the foregoing cities The two first Printers were  BARTHOLOMEW  de Val de Zochio  of  Padua  c  MARTIN  de Septem Arboribus  OF these we have but three editions  PETER MAUFER whom we have already mention'd under the articles of  Venice  and  Verona  we have four editions of his printed at  Padua  from to  LAURENCE CANOZIUS  de Lendenaro  edit  ALBERT  de Stendalia  edit  JOHN HERBERT or  Herbort  edit and one without date or places name  ANTON  de Carcano  edit  MATTHEW  de Cerdonis de Windischegrets  edit from to  MOSES  de Castello  edit  JEROM  de Duranti  edit he wrought also in  Pavia  with  Christopher de Canibus ann    LEWIS or  Alois de Como  c edit  BARTHOLOMEW  de Trossis  edit  With a few more without Printers names  CHAP IX  The Cities of  Louvain Ulms Utrecht  ann  Turin Genoa Brescia Alost  ann    Article  I  The City of  LOUVAIN  LOUVAIN in  Latin Lovanium  is a large populous and well fenced city the capital of all  Brabant  and one of the most frequented universities in  Europe  founded by  John  duke of  Brabant anno  It abounds with magnificent colleges and other sumptuous edifices according to that of the poet  Postea Musarum Sedem Collegiaque ampla    Lovani  aspicienda dedit  IT is likewise famous for the vast number of its students especially in divinity tho' the reader will scarce forbear wondering what sort of divines they must have been when we tell him that they had the Art of Printing near thirty years  i e  from to and God knows how far beyond and never printed one single bible in all that time at least as I can find in any annalist whereas we have observ'd that a  Nuremberg  Printer namely  Ant Koburger  printed at least a dozen in that time the truth is if we judge by the small number of workmen and of impressions done here we shall be apt to think that the Art of Printing met with but small encouragement since if we except the first Printer of whom we shall speak presently I can find but two more till the year after which whoever examines the second volume of Mr  Mattaire  's  Annales Typographici  will find them run much thinner of either  THE first press was set up here by  JOHN  de Westphalia  of  Paderbourn  an eminent Printer invited to  Louvain  by some of the heads of that university where he continu'd printing till  ano  if we except editions printed in his name if not by him the first in the town of  Alost  in  Flanders  not far from that of  Louvain anno  as shall be mention'd at the end of this chapter and the other  viz Epistola de Simonia Vitanda  c  per rev' Magist Engelbertum Cultificis  c  Novimagii  Julii  WE have nineteen editions of his from to some of which are without date place or Printer's name but easily known to be his by the character  JOHN VELDENER edit of the  Fasciculus Temporum  and  EGIDIUS VENDER HEERSTRATEN edit to And five or six more without Printer's name  Article  II  The City of  ULMS  ULMS a considerable city in  High Germany  situate near the  Danube  between  Ausburg Constance  and  Strasburgh  and famous for the finest linnen and cambrick with which it furnishes most parts of  Europe  began to set up the Art of Printing sometime before the year  JOHN ZEINER  de Reutlingen    WAS the first who practis'd it there He was a native of  Reutlingen  a small city in the duchy of  Wirtembergh  which we have mention'd as one of the first in  Germany  that receiv'd the art  viz ann  This Printer was in all probability the son or brother of  Gunter Zeiner  who work'd at  Ausburgh  from  ann  and is mention'd under that article  p  We have but nine editions of his from to two of which are the  Latin Bible  fol and one  viz Alvarius Pelagius de planctû Ecclesiae    vol fol  in large paper is reckon'd a very curious as well as scarce edition he used to subscribe himself sometimes  Jo Zeiner de Reutlingen  or  Reutlinga  and sometimes  Jo Zeiner Ulmensis Oppidi Incolam  LEONARD HOL citizen of  Ulm  edit  JOHN REGER  de Kemnat  edit from to  Article  III  The City of  UTRECHT  UTRECHT in  Latin Ultra trajectum  a city in  Flanders  upon the  Rhine  and subject to the emperor of  Germany  receiv'd the Art of Printing about  ann  if not before but its productions have been so few and inconsiderable that no annalist  De la Caille  and F  Orlandi  excepted has taken any notice of them and even the latter has been able to discover no more than three editions little remarkable either for bulk or beauty for which reason I suppose they are all three without Printer's name  Article  IV  The City of  TURIN  TURIN in  Latin Taurinum  the capital of  Piedmont  and residence of the dukes of  Savoy  now kings of  Sardinia  is situate upon the river  Durio  nigh the  Po  near the western  Alps  It is a large rich and populous city and university strongly fortify'd and adorn'd with magnificent palaces churches and edifices It receiv'd the Art of Printing about  ann  The first artists who set up their presses here were  JOHN FABRI  and JOHANNINUS  de Petro  THESE two printed together at first as appears by their first impression  viz Breviarium Romanum fol  per  Jo Fabri  and  Johanninum de Petro  but  Fabri  associated himself with  Martin Huz  a Printer of the city of  Lyons  with whom he printed some editions and some by himself however he continu'd still at  Turin  and we have three editions more of his printed there by himself from to wherein he subscribes himself  JoFabri Lingonensis  as for his partner we have nothing of him but the breviary abovemention'd  NICOLAS  de Benedictis  edit from to  and JACOPIN SVIGUS edit from to  Article  V  The City of  GENOA  GENOA in  Latin Janua  is a rich populous ancient city the metropolis of  Liguria  and capital of the republick of  Genoa  it is fam'd for having given birth to  Christopher Columbus  the first discoverer of  America  and for the greatness and extent of her maritime trade we meet with two noted Printers who came and set up their presses there  ann    viz  MATTHIAS MORAVUS  de Olomuntz    and MICHEL MONK or  de Monacho    BUT whether that city chose to drive any other trade rather than that of books or whether they found it already furnished from other places and so met with but small encouragement or for whatever other reason 'tis certain they tarry'd not long there For  Moravus  printed but  one book in company with  Monk  and the next year remov'd to  Naples  where he continued 'till  ann  as hath been said in the article of that city and we hear no further of  Monk  The book they printed here is  Supplementum summae quae Pisanella vocatur  fol  per  Matthiam Moravum  de  Olomuntz    Michaelem  de  Monacho  socium ejus  x  kal Julii Millesimo quadringentesimo  LIJ  quarto  where LIJ stands for LXX  It is very likely that the ill success of these two Printers frighten'd others from coming thither for we don't meet with any that ventur'd to settle there after them 'till a long time after the close of the century  Article  VI  The City of  BRESCIA  BRESCIA in  Latin Brixia  an ancient and noble city in  Lombardy  now under the republick of  Venice  gave much greater encouragement to the Art of Printing than some of the last nam'd cities About the year  HENRY  of  COLOGN  and  STATIUS GALLICUS  CAME and settled here and printed the following book the only one yet known to be printed by them here  viz  Homeri Iliades per  Laurentium Vallensem  in Latinum sermonem  raductae  c viii  kal Decemb per  Henr Coloniensem    Statium Gallicum  Brixiae    BONINUS  de  BONINIS  of  RAGUSIO  WHOSE first works were printed at  Verona ann  as has been said Thence he remov'd to  Brescia  where he continu'd printing 'till  ann    HIS corrector was  Marcus Scaramuccinus  of  Palazzolo  there are editions of his printed at  Brescia  from to  BARTHOLOM VERSELLENSIS Printer and bookseller edition  JAMES BRITANNICUS brothers of the city of  Brescia    ANGEL BRITANNICUS brothers of the city of  Brescia    THE first of these was some time partner to  John de Forlivio  at  Venice  about the year as you'll find  pag  after which he came to his own city  Brescia  and printed sometimes by himself and sometimes with his brother  Angelo  his corrector was a Franciscan monk nam'd  Angel de Montelmo  we have edit of the former from to and with both their names  ann    ARNOLD  de Arundis  edit without date  RABBI GHERSON  RABBI GHERSON was the son of  R Moses  a jew of  Soncino  where  Hebrew  first began to be printed he settled first at  Brescia  where he printed the two following editions in  Hebrew  viz  Mechaberith Rabb Immanuelis per  Rabbi Gherson Brixiae  Biblia Hebraicé  vo  per  Gersonem  F  Mosis Soncinatem  ibid    CHEVILLIER tells us likewise  p  that he printed also at  Riminium  in  Romania  a  Hebrew  edition intitled  Col bo  without date after this he remov'd his press to  Constantinople  where he printed several other  Hebrew  works 'till the year in which he is suppos'd to have dy'd  BERNARDINE MISENTI  de Pavia  came first from  Cremona  where he had printed in company with  Caesar de Parma ann  we have but edit of his done at  Brescia  from to  FRANCIS LAURINI citizen of  Brescia  we have only one edition of his  viz Homer's Iliads  translated into  Latin  by  Laur Valla  corrected by  Baptista Farsengus  a priest of that city it has no place's name but is suppos'd to be done at  Brescia  THERE are about edit more without Printer's names  Article  VII  The City of  ALOST  ALOST is a small town in  Flanders  upon the river  Tever  between  Brussels  and  Gaunt  in which the following Printers set up their presses  viz  JOHN  de Westphalia    THEODORIC MARTIN of  Alost    THE former of these a native of  Paderborn  printed in the city of  Louvain ann  'till as we have shewn in that article We find likewise a book printed by him at  Alost ann  in company with  Theodoric Martin  a native of it as follows  Liber praedicabilium  vo  per  Jo de Westphalia Paderbonensem  cum  Theodorico Martini  Maii die sexto in  Alosto oppido comitatus Fland  THEODORIC MARTIN afterwards printed by himself first at  Alost  'till then at  Antwerp ann  and at  Louvain ann  His mark us'd to be a shield hanging upon a vine with T M tho' at other times he made use of two anchors with his name  Theodoric Martin excudebat  His

 Latin Basilea  and by  Ptolemy Augusta Rauricorum  is an ancient city and university in  Switzerland  water'd by the two great rivers  Rhine  and  Brise  which being navigable increase very much the commerce and riches of it so that in spite of all the calamities it has suffer'd in war it is one of the most opulent cities of  Germany  The university is likewise very celebrated for learned men in all sciences and was founded  ann  and endow'd with privileges equal to any university in  Europe  by pope  Pius  II In this city pope  Martin  V call'd a council  ann  soon after which it became famous for the improvements  which the Art of Printing brought thither in or before the year receiv'd from some of its artificers who have been generally the best and most learned Printers in  Europe  and publish'd the most elegant and correct editions of the ancient fathers and of the  Greek  and  Latin  classicks Of this number were  John Amerbach  and  John Froben  of whom we shall give an account in the sequel of this article  THE first book we meet with printed here has no Printer's name nor is it possible to guess from the character or any thing else in the edition who 'twas done by It is as follows  Roberti de Licio opus quadragesimale  Basileae  BERNARD RICHEL  A citizen of  Basil  and an excellent Printer was the first who put his name to his editions there we have but three of them The first is his  Biblia Latina  fol  per  Bernardum Richel  civem  Basiliae the other two are dated  MICHEL WENKLER edit from to  THE last of his impressions  viz Gasparini Pergamensis Epistolae  to F  Orlandi  tells us in his list  p  that this has neither date nor Printer's name but Mr  Mattaire  gives us the same edition under the names of  Michel Wenkler  and  Fred Biel  with some verses at the end as you'll find in that author  Annal Typogr  p only he or his Printer has mistaken  Parmensis  for  Pergamensis  NICHOLAS KESLER citizen of  Basil    OF whom we have a  Biblia Sacra  printed at  Antwerp ann  and five other editions at  Basil  from to his first edition  viz Textus Sententiarum fol  has the colophon which you will find in the margin in imitation of  Faust Schoeffer  and others  Anno domini millesimo quadringentesimo octuagesimo sexto octavo nonas Martii non atramentali penna cannave sed quadam ingeniosa arte imprimendi cunctipotenti aspirante deo in egregia urbe  Basilionsi Nicolaus K  sl  r selicuter consummavit    HIS last work  viz Libri deflorationum  does not bear  Kesler  's name yet it being printed in the same character with the former is easily known  to be his It hath at the beginning the image of an old man with a triple face and these words over it  Sancta Trinitas  JOHN AMERBACH  JOHN AMERBACH one of the most excellent and learned Printers of his time was at first a student at  Paris  under the famous  Jo Lapidanus  or  a Lapide  who being rector of that university invited the three  Germans  thither  Amerbach  follow'd his studies 'till he attain'd to the degree of master of arts soon after which he came to  Basil  and set up the Art of Printing for which he became as famous as he had been before for his learning  WHAT countryman he was is not easy to determine Some  French  annalists challenge him for theirs and  Orlandi  calls him a  Parisian  tho' perhaps on no other account than that he studied so long in that university His name is unquestionably  German  but neither the colophons of his editions nor his epitaph make any mention of his country for which reason we shall not pretend to affirm any thing upon that head His first care at his entrance into the business of Printing was to get a font of the most perfect round Roman which however he made no use of in his books of divinity the prevailing custom of those days being to print them in old Gothic His next was to procure some of the best correctors of that age of whom tho' no person was more capable of correcting his works than himself he had a greater number than any of his contemporaries Among these were  Martin Dodo  a prebend  Francis Wyler  a learned Franciscan fryar  Conrard Pelican  an eminent divine  Beatus Rhenanus  and others He was so carefull and diligent in this province that he would not let one sheet pass unrevis'd by himself  Reuchlin  gives us this character of him in the preface to his book  De verbo mirifico  that he was a man of an excellent genius highly valuable for the neatness and correctness of his works and well skill'd in several arts and sciences His former master  Jo Lapidanus  assures us  I stud ego non favoris sed veritatis gratia ausim dicere quod non legerim libros hac arte effictos quos tuis emendatiores exactiorique stilo consummatos probaverim Vide  Chevil  p  that he never read any books better  or more correctly printed than his As  Amerbach  was a man of singular piety and zeal for religion which appears from all his prefaces that scarce breathe any thing else so he rather chose to consecrate his labours to that than any other branch of learning This induc'd him to print the works of all the ancient fathers a task hitherto unattempted by any Printer He began with an edition of St  Austin  which he finish'd not 'till the year in the old Gothic But as he neither had a good manuscript to print after nor sufficient assistance from the learned we can only say that it was executed as correctly as could be expected in those times What he had most at heart was to publish St  Jerom  's works which as he knew was impossible to be done without a competent skill in the  Latin Greek  and  Hebrew  tongues the last of which he was too old and full of business to learn he made his three sons youths of bright parts divide that province among themselves who having study'd those languages were oblig'd by him whether he liv'd or dy'd to finish that edition which they faithfully perform'd But as this task wherein he was engaged was too large for one man he took the learned  John Froben  whom we shall mention hereafter into partnership and printed several valuable and distinct volumes with him The greatest part of these particulars we have from  Erasmus  in his prefaces to St  Austin  and St  Jerom  which later edition he revis'd and publish'd  anno  with a dedication to the archbishop of  Canterbury  He highly extolls the piety of the  Amerbachs  he praises the father for having taken such care of his sons education and the sons for the great progress they made in those tongues and for their piety in having so exactly fulfill'd their father's desire in the impression of a work which had cost them so much money and pains he frankly owns that as he stood in great need of some assistance for the  Hebrew  tongue so he was chiefly beholden to those three learned brothers for it  D Erasm  praefat ad  S Hieron  operaQuod idem fecimus in Hebraicis verum hac sane in parte quod minus nostro marte poteramus aliorum suppetiis praestititimus praecipue fratrum

Jodoc Bad epist ad Anton Coburger ann    that he was a man of indefatigable industry and consummate skill in correcting the errors of corrupt copies and adds that if all Printers would but follow his example they would be in much higher reputation with the learned than they were  HE continu'd printing 'till the year and dyed whilst his second impression of St  Austin  was in the press It will not be amiss to repeat here a caution which we have elsewhere given the reader not to confound this  John Amerbach  with  John Averbach  of  Reutlingen  who printed there a  Latin  bible in  fol ann  after which we hear no more of him  La Caille  makes them to be the same person led undoubtedly into that error by the likeness of their names whereas the distance of time between them  viz  from to the different spelling of their names with other obvious circumstances might easily have shewn him the mistake Mr  Mattaire  in the place before quoted hath collected a great number of extracts out of prefaces epistles and other works of the learned in praise of him and it must be own'd that too much could not be said in a man's commendation who had spent near years in the service of religion with such constant zeal and application I shall refer the reader to that author for them and only add the epitaph which his youngest son  Boniface  caus'd to be set upon his tomb  EPITAPHIUM  Joannes

editions of his as yet discover'd from to the first of them is  Vincentii Bellovacensis opuscula  and the last  Fr Petrarchae opuscula    JOHN FROBEN  JOHN FROBEN was a native of  Hamelburgh  in  Fraconia  where he study'd 'till he became master of the  Latin  tongue and afterwards went to the university of  Basil  where he perfected himself in  Greek  also and betook himself to the business of Printing of which he show'd himself so good a master that  John Amerbach  took him as assistant and partner in his laborious and expensive undertaking of publishing the ancient fathers as we hinted before He acquitted himself so well both in this province and his own particular one that he acquir'd as great a reputation and esteem among the learned as his contemporary and partner to whom  Germany  is oblig'd for bringing thither the neat round Roman character hitherto scarcely known there and improving it to the last degree of perfection No person was ever more curious in the choice of the works which he sent to the press than he who had this excellent quality among many others that he would never print any bad books such as the sordid avarice of other Printers had overstock'd the world with but always chose the best authors and best manuscripts of them sparing neither  cost in purchasing them nor pains in correcting and fitting them for the press in which tho' he was a man of singular learning yet he always preferr'd the advice and judgment of the learned of his time to his own Among these were  Mark Heyland Erasmus Wolfgang Musculus Jo Oecolampadius Wolfgang Lachner  and others all persons of the highest rank in the commonwealth of learning for which reasons his impressions have ever been and will continue in the highest esteem with all the learned He was likewise particularly ambitious to have his works correct and the abovemention'd learned men assisted him very much in that province especially  Oecolampadius  who tells us  OEcolampadius  in his epistle at the end of  Erasmus  's edition of the New Testament in  Greek  with a new  Latin  version printed by  Froben ann  and dedicated to Pope Leo Xadmirabile spectaculum mihi erat imo spectandum miraculum dictantem recognoscentemque quantum tria praela exciperent videre ac nihilo secius interim Graeca Latinaque exemplaria eaque varia vetustissima consulentem Graecos Latinosque interpretes conferentem priscos ac recentiores primae simul ac infimae classis scriptores per pendentemnimi rum  Erasmicum  imitati exemplum qui ipse hic caeteris rebus omissis bonam temporis partem in hoc collocavit negotium  that he could not sufficiently wonder that  Erasmus  who alone kept three presses continually at work who read and compar'd the  Greek  and  Latin  m  nuscripts and consulted the writings of all the ancients and moderns  c  could yet find time enough to correct the proofs of his works and adds that his example had not a little encourag'd him to take the laborious task of a corrector upon him However neither  Froben  's nor his corrector's diligence could prevent that edition just now quoted in the margin from having an errata of a page and half tho'  Erasmus  gave the finishing hand to every proof  THIS learned author in one of his letters to  Bilibaldus Parcheimerus  who was then at the emperor's court complains highly of a great injustice done to many good Printers in general and to  Froben  particularly which was that he had no sooner publish'd a good edition with great cost and labour but it was immediately reprinted by others and sold so much cheaper that he could never reimburse himself half his charges This reduc'd him to the necessity of obtaining from the emperor  c  a privilege for the sole selling them for the space of two or more years according to the value of the work there being no other effectual way of preventing such an abuse the letter is dated from  Basil Jan  the  reader will find it in  Vita Erasmi Leyden  edit in  o    pag  what relates to our subject he will find in the margin  Plerique insidiantur Homini propemo dum conju  ati ut illum perdant Ubi quid novi operis prodit quod putent fore vendibile mox unus atque alter suffuratus ex ipsius

ineptum aut seditiosum    WE have had occasion to mention some cheats of even a worse nature with respect to the  Venetian  editions which were counterfeited with the Printer's mark and sold for the right ones tho' incorrect and imperfect to the last degree  TO return to  Froben  he is reported to have hang'd his proofs in publick sight with a promise of a reward for every error that should be discover'd in them by any person In his short preface to  Celius Rhodiginus  printed  ann  he inveighs loudly against those pests of learning those Printers who regarded not the correction of their works but had gain only in their view and advises the learned against buying such bad books for the sake of their cheapness assuring them that they purchas'd nothing but plague and vexation and  that such wretched works could not but be dearly bought how cheap soever they were sold whereas he that bought a correct copy always bought it cheap how much soever he gave for it  Parvo emit quisquis librum emendatum etiam magno emit magno emit quisquis cod  cem mendosum etiam minimo emit  ibid    JO FROBEN printed few volumes before the year and the number of those which are extant is still smaller One of them was his concordance of the bible in  fol ann  concerning which we meet with some particulars not unworthy the reader's knowledge tho' a digression from our subject  FIRST it was so exactly printed that there was not one error in all the numerical figures which in a work of that nature are at least one third part of the matter and is therefore very surprizing  Froben  added a second part to it which contain'd all the indeclinable particles that are to be met with in the bible This work was begun at  Constantinople  by  Jo de Raguza  a Parisian divine of the Dominican order embassador  from the council of  Baden  to the emperor  Jo Paleologus  about the year yet he did little to it himself but left it to his three chaplains one of whom was a  Scotchman  nam'd  Walter Sonaw  who finish'd it in almost three years After this it was reduc'd into an alphabetical order by the directions of that council by  John de Segovia  or  Secubia  archdeacon of  Cujedo  and doctor of divinity What gave birth to this second part of the concordance was no less remarkable  John de Raguza  beforemention'd coming to  Constantinople  found the divines there engag'd in a very warm dispute concerning the procession of the Holy Ghost  i e  whether from the Son as well as from the Father and that the controversy seem'd chiefly to be about the particles  ex  and  per i e  whether it should be  ex filio  or  per filium  He was likewise inform'd that the  Sultan  and all the  Mahometans  having heard that  Paleologus  design'd a journey into christendom in order to reconcile this difference between the  Greek  and  Latin  churches had rally'd the christians with no small scorn whom two such seemingly insignificant particles had divided to such a degree This embassador fail'd not to acquaint the council with it who immediately order'd  John de Segovia  to be ready to answer all the difficulties which the  Greeks  should propose at their arrival at  Basil  In the mean time the  Hussites  and  John Huss  of  Bohemia  who were already at  Basil  and insisted upon a communion in both kinds from the words of our Saviour  Unless you eat  c and  unless you drink  c which their opposers said signify'd no more than unless you eat or drink from which they concluded that either the one or the other was sufficient to fulfill the command these I say made it still more necessary to have a concordance that should explain the meaning of those particles  ex  and  per nisi  and  et  and in how many different senses they were us'd in scripture This induc'd  John de Segovia  to write the second part of the concordance relating to indeclinable words with a prolegomenon or preface in which he hath given us this account of the occasion of it The learned  Sebastian Brant  author of the  Navis stultifera  caus'd it to be printed by  Froben ann  and somewhat above twenty years after the same  Froben  reprinted it with an elegant  Latin  dialogue between a bookseller and the buyer relating to the value of good books instead of a preface to that edition The reader may see it at length in  Chevillier  p  FROBEN had two sons  Jerom  and  John  who succeeded their father and publish'd a great number of volumes with good reputation after his death which happen'd  ann    Erasmus  tells us that what he had most at heart was to give the world a correct edition of St  Austin  's works and that he desir'd to live no longer than to see it finish'd  Ut inter familiares subinde dicere solitus fit se non optare longius vitae spatium quam quod absolvendo sufficeret Augustino  Erasm epist ad Ammonium  Tom oper p  However he was depriv'd of that pleasure for  J AndEndters  tells us tho' he kept seven presses continually at work upon that edition yet not above two volumes of it were printed before he died to the great loss and grief of all the learned world the following epitaph written by his friend  Erasmus  was afterwards set upon his tomb  Epitaphium JOANNIS FROBENII  per  Desiderium Erasmum Rot  Arida  Joannis  tegit hic lapis ossa  Frobeni  Orbe vivet toto nescia fama mori  Moribus hanc niveis meruit studiisque juvandis  Quae nunc maesta jacent orba parente suo  Rettulit ornavit veterum monumenta sophorum  Arte manu curis aere favore fide  Huic vitam in caelis date numina justa perennem  Per nos in terris fama perennis erit  THIS epitaph was afterwards printed according to  la Caille  in  Henry Stephen's Artis Typographicae Querimonia Erasmus  wrote another of four verses in  Greek  which the Reader may see in  Matt Annal Typog  v p  ERASMUS was not contented with writing the abovemention'd epitaphs in his late friend's praise but he made likewise a kind of funeral oration or rather elogium upon him in a letter to  John Emsted  a learned  Carthusian  the reader may see it at full length in the abovemention'd  Annals  vol pag  seq  AND indeed it was no more than he ow'd him since  Froben  had long before given him a pleasure which few men beside him had ever tasted which was to see his own elegy before his death the occasion of it was  as follows Before these two were become intimate  Froben  had heard that  Erasmus  was dead and wrote much such another funeral oration upon him which he prefix'd to an edition of that great man's proverbs which he publish'd  Ann    Erasmus  could not but be highly pleas'd to see himself prais'd in so extraordinary and sincere a manner being well assur'd that such encomiums could not proceed from flattery or self interest for  Erasmus  being suppos'd dead  Froben  could have nothing to hope from him and had any but a man of  Froben  's integrity and honour committed such a mistake one might be apt to suspect it had been wilfully done in hopes of procuring some valuable pieces from that learned author but whoever is acquainted with that Printer's character will undoubtedly believe him incapable of such mean arts I think therefore it will not be amiss to close the history of this great Printer with some conspicuous parts of his character which we have not yet touch'd upon and which will easily acquit him of any suspicion which is that he was a man of the most disinterested and generous disposition  Erasmus  in his letter to  Emsted  abovemention'd does even tell us that he was so to a fault and that he had often reprov'd him for it but in vain for his natural candor was proof against all admonitions of that kind neither did his munificence to men of learning and merit show itself only in the largeness of his presents to them but in the manner of bestowing them never says that author did he seem better pleas'd than when he had either by intreaties or by some cunning device prevail'd upon them to accept of some favour from him The grief he shew'd in his countenance at their denial was such that they found it more difficult to refuse a favour from him than to obtain one from another person and when by chance continues he I have bought me some cloath for a gown he has privately sent and paid for it unknown to me As his house was open to all learned men so none had a heartier welcome than  Erasmus  who us'd it as his home all the time he continued at  Basil  and it is probable that he might have continued longer there had he not observ'd something in his family which he could not forbear grieving at  Froben  was under petticoatgovernment which made his affairs go somewhat wrong wherefore he expresses himself thus to him in a letter dated from  Louvain Fama tibi parta est ea poterit tibi magno emolumento  esse si curam de tuo adhibueris sed mihi non placet domi tuae regnum istud Muliebre  c But  Froben  was of too easy and patient a temper to give himself any trouble about it we have a remarkable instance of this in the last year of his life when being seiz'd with such a violent pain in his right heel that some physicians were for cutting off his foot he had no sooner receiv'd some easement in it than he went on horseback to  Frankfort  about some business and tho' advis'd by his friends to stir seldomer abroad to go warmer in cloaths and to spare himself as much as possible he refus'd to hearken to them and took such care to conceal his bad state of health and the anguish of his pain that he went still about his business 'till being seiz'd with a fainting fit he dropt down and broke his skull against the pavement after which he continued two days without any sense or motion and expir'd  ann  I hope the name and character of the person will excuse my account of these particularities especially since the great  Erasmus  has thought them worth recording in a much ampler manner he left two sons  Jerom  and  John  who became excellent Printers and signaliz'd themselves by their editions of the  Greek  and  Latin  fathers he had likewise some daughters one of whom nam'd  Justina  he marry'd to  Nicolas l'Evesque  or  Episcopius  an eminent Printer of  Basil  HIS usual mark or rebus was a dove sitting on the top of a staff with two basilisks twin'd about it to which he sometimes added the initial letters of both his names IO FRO and sometimes the fourth verse of the th psalm in  Hebrew  the sixteenth verse of St  Matthew  's th chapter in  Greek  and these words in  Latin Prudens Simplicitas Amorque recti  in three distinct lines All the works we have extant of his from to are only four  viz  a  Latin  bible vo in a small character dated Another in the old  Gothic  vo his concordance of the bible mention'd before  fol anno  and the  Speculum decem Prae  ptorum  of  Henry Harp  I CAN find but one more Printer after him  viz  JOHN BERGMAN  de  OLPE  OF whom we have only two editions of  Sebastian Brant  's  Navis stultise  a  dated and the last of which is adorn'd with wooden cutts  BESIDES these F  Orlandi  has given us a list of above  Basil  editions without Printers names  Article  II  The Cities of  Esling Placentia  and  Pignerol  THESE three cities being inconsiderable with respect to their Productions in the Art of Printing except the earliness of their receiving it I have joyn'd them into one short article  § ESLING is a small city in the duchy of  Wirtembergh  in  Germany  It receiv'd Printing either about or before the year tho' we can meet but with the two following editions printed there by  CONRARD FYNER  viz  PETRI Nigri

Printer  JAMES  des  ROUGES or  de  RUBEIS  Set up his Press after he had printed at  Venice  from to with vast applause The first book which we find printed by him is  a Latin  bible dated in which all our annalists have follow'd father  se Long  but it is doubtful whether he was not mistaken in the year  seeing  des Rouges  was still printing at  Venice anno  and that we find no more impressions of his done at  Pignerol  'till  anno    HOWEVER as it is not easy to determine whether father  le Long  was in an error or the bible antedated or whether this Printer kept two Presses at the same time one at  Venice  and another at  Pignerol  I have follow'd the order of the annalists and ventur'd to place this edition and city under that year  WE have but four editions of his printed at  Pignerol  that of the bible of included two of which are dated and the last  Article  III  The City of  VINCENTIA  VINCENTIA is a large ancient city and university in  Italy  now under the

between the provinces of  Saxony  and  Alsatia  upon the  Baltick  sea It is very eminent for its trade port fortifications riches and number of inhabitants  HITHER the Art of Printing was brought  anno  yet appears to have met with but little encouragement from its trading inhabitants for we find only four Printers in this city from to and they were so far from settling here any time that their bad success had oblig'd them to quit the place for we have but five editions extant of them all their names are as follows  LUCAS BRANDIS  de Schafz  edit from to  STEPHEN ARNOLD edit  STEPHEN ARNDES

edition from  Burgos  in  Spain  and they seem to be in the right because the book is written in  Spanish  and the Printer's name shews him to be of that nation  § DELPH is a fine city in  Holland  near the  Hague  and  Rotterdam  We meet with seven editions printed there all without any Printer's name the first of which  viz  the  Dutch  bible is dated  anno  The rest are dated as follows two two one the last  CHAP XI  The Cities of  Spire Lyons  anno  Geneva Brussels Coscence  and  Pavia  anno  Goude Zivol  anno    and  Caen Ceulen Cenzano  and  Quilemburgh  anno  Lignitz Husselet Regio Mont royal  and  Wartzburgh  anno  Pisa Aquila Erford  and  Langres  anno    And  Gaunt  and  Memining  anno    Article  I  The City of  SPIRE  SPIRE is an ancient city in higher  Germany  situate upon the  Rhine  between  Mentz  and  Strasburgh  It is now call'd in  Latin Spira  but formerly was call'd  Novimagium  and  Nemetes  THO' this city doth not seem to have cultivated the Art of Printing within her walls so much as other cities of  Germany  yet it ought to be remembred for having given birth to some eminent Printers who went  and settled in other parts of  Europe  and in particular the two famous brothers who first set up their presses at  Venice  viz  John  and  Windelin  of  Spire  of whom we have given an account in the third chapter of this second part Here we find the first beginnings of the Art about the year when  PETER DRACH  of  SPIRE  PRINTED the  Summa  of  Archiep Antoninus  which is the first book we know of printed by him as he is likewise the only Printer who put his name to any impressions done in this city His editions are but four in number from to besides which we find about ten more printed here without the names of the Printers  IT will not be improper to observe here that our latest annalists place the city of  Westminster  under this year the oldest edition as yet discover'd by them being  Socrates  's  Sayings  printed by  Caxton anno  however the reader will find by the third book of this history that there is a more ancient one by three years  viz The Game of Chess  which is dated  anno  now in the possession of my worthy friend the curious Mr  Granger  of the  EastIndia House  and it is plain from the account of the Art's being brought into  England  that they began to print in the abbey of  Westminster  much sooner than that year  Article  II  The City of  LYONS  LYONS a rich and populous city in  France  upon the rivers  Rhone  and  Arare  is call'd in  Latin Lugdunum  and is allow'd to be one of the most ancient cities in  Europe  so that some  French  writers have not scrupled to fix the date of its foundation within or years after the flood which may more easily be believ'd than disprov'd It has been always eminent for men of learning in all arts and sciences which were particularly cultivated there but more especially after the Art of Printing was introduc'd which receiv'd such encouragement there that it has continu'd in a flourishing condition ever since Some annalists have asserted that it is the first city in  France  which set up a Printingpress but if we would judge of this controversy by the dates of the oldest impressions  we shall find that the city of  Tours  and next that of  Paris  had the Art several years before as hath been already shewn However if  Lyons  hath not the preference of  Rome Paris Venice  c either for the antiquity or beauty of its productions it must be acknowledg'd that it hath gain'd it by the quantity of large impressions than which no city in  Europe  has furnish'd the learned with a greater number It is still a great  emporium  or market for books in all languages and sciences and as it hath encourag'd some of the best artists to settle there and publish beautiful and correct editions so it has induc'd many a wretched one to chuse it as a proper place to print and vend a much greater quantity of bad and counterfeit ones but this hath happen'd in most famous cities of  Europe Lyons  hath likewise been celebrated if not for introducing at least for encouraging the  Gothick  character and publish'd more volumes of that sort in proportion to those that were done in fine Roman than any other city and what is more remarkable of the Printers of this city they were vastly more fond of that inelegant character than of the Roman especially for bibles divinity law and physick books  THE reader will be justly surpriz'd to hear what encomiums they gave it and how proud they were of their performances in that kind I have subjoin'd in the margin three or four scraps of their colophons to shew what a piece of merit the Printers of the th and above half of the th century made of their works printed in this character not only at  Lyons  but likewise at  Venice Paris Rome  c  Sublimi literarum effigie  c  John de Cologne  at  Venice  us'd to phrase it thus  Done in sublimely fine characters  c another  Charactere jucundissimo M Joan Herbort Alemani cujus vis et ingenium facile supereminet omnes  values himself upon the beauty and excellence of his character a third  Opus pulchro literarum charactere politissimum  c  calls it the most elegant character and a fourth  Certante minio purpurae rubedine Superante cervas nigredine sepiâpolitioribus characterum typis  c  the most polite of all characters so that if a person did not see what Types they meant he would be apt to judge it any other than the  Gothick  The famous  Badius  sirnam'd  Ascensius  who had printed in this city of  Lyons  from to is reported to have gone afterwards to  Paris  with a design to stop as  much as possible the current vogue of this old Gothick but in vain for he was oblig'd to continue it himself till almost the very later end of his days and besides it still remain'd in great use long after that insomuch that  Atensis  complains  Lynceis u  u  tur oculis Herculeo labore  i quando ethni  orum aliquis aut nugax poeta  u  verbosus orator est imprimendus sacris quosvis typos quamvis trito  consusaneos adhibent Praesat ad Gregor  that Printers were extremely curious and spar'd no cost to give elegant impressions of the heathen poets orators  c  whereas any batter'd old Gothick Types were thought good enough for those of Divinity In the close of this second book we shall mention some of the Printers to whom the world is oblig'd for the total disuse of that inelegant character To return to  Lyons  the first Printer we find there is  BARTHOLOMEW BUYER  Of whom we have only the two following impressions the first viz the new Testament in French is without date and has been suppos'd by  de la Caille  to have been printed about but  F Le Long  more justly supposes it both by the rudeness of the character and its likeness to that of the next edition of  Buyer  which is dated to have been printed about this time  MARTIN HUSZ two edit from to  and JOS FABER two edit from to  PERRINE LATHOMI edit  He printed likewise at  Venice  with some others about  WILLIAM  le  ROY edit from to  JANON CARCAIGNI edit from to  MICHELET TOPIE  de Piemont  edit from to  and JAMES

FONTAINE of  Lyons  edit  JOHN TRECHSEL  German  edit from to  Whose corrector was the famous  Jodocus Badius  of whom we shall speak hereafter some of whose learned works comments and annotations he printed  anno    seq  as  Silvae Morales cum interpretatione  Badii  ex  Virgil Horat Pers Juvenal Ennio Bapt Mantuan Sulpit Caton with some others which we shall speak of anon I must not omit mentioning that all  Trechsel  's works are highly valuable and correct  ENGOLHARD SCHULTIS  German  edit  MATTHIAS HUTS edit  ANT LABILLON edit both  and MARTIN SARACENI edit both  JODOCUS BADIUS  sirnam'd  ASCENSIUS  Badius  was born in the castle of  Ase  in the territories of  Brussels  and call'd  Ascensius  from it He spent his younger years in study at  Brussels Gaunt  and last of all in the university of  Ferrara  under the great  Bapt Guarini  where he became master of the  Greek  and  Latin  tongues and very famous for his learning and parts He remov'd afterwards to the city of  Lyons  where he publickly taught those two languages and became corrector to  Jo Trechsel  's press as has been said before He publish'd several works some of which were his own as  Silvae morales contra vitia  fol  Epigrammatum  lib  Navicula Stultarum mulierum  the Life of  Thomas a Kempis  prefix'd to his works and some others Several excellent commentaries were likewise written by him upon the greatest part of the classicks and other  Latin  authors as  Horace Juvenal Martial Lucretius Seneca Salust Valerius Maximus Quintilian Aulus Gellius  and others all which he printed himself in  folio  very elegantly and correctly tho' some of the first he caus'd to be printed by  John Trechsel  whose daughter he afterwards married and had many children by her To all his editions which were not a few he us'd to prefix an epistle dedicatory address'd to some person eminent either for his quality piety or learning Among others he dedicated the first Volume of  Tho Waldensis  works to pope  Clement  VII After he had taken the business of printing upon him he became so excellent a Printer that the learned  Rob Gaguin  general of the Trinitarian Order  who was perfectly well acquainted with his merit wrote a letter to him to desire him to undertake the printing of his works This with some other invitations of the learned brought  Badius  to  Paris  about presently after his fatherinlaw's death where he design'd to teach the  Greek  tongue and where his last endeavour after he had furnish'd himself with fine sets of Roman characters was to explode the old Gothick both in his works and by his example as we hinted before And accordingly printed the  Philobiblion  of that great encourager of learning  Richard Bury  lord high chancellor of  England  bishop of  Durham  and founder of the  Oxford  library towards the middle of the th century which book was sent to him by Dr  Bureau  bishop of  Cisteron  and confessor to the  French  king in order to be printed by him This was the first book known that came to the press after he set it up at  Paris  'tis dated the next year he printed the  Provinciale seu constitutiones Angliae cum Annotationibus Gullielmi Lindewode  in  vol fol in a beautiful round Roman This book as  de la Caille  tells us is very scarce and much sought for being very necessary for those who would understand the old  French  us'd in  William  the conqueror's time tho' I doubt he is mistaken the work itself being in  Latin  He began to print by himself about the year at which time the great  Aldus Manutius  began at  Venice  than whom neither that age nor the next produc'd two more learned or excellent Printers  As this later was chiefly engag'd in printing and correcting of  Greek  authors so  Badius  was employ'd in the  Latin  ones and there seem'd a kind of friendly emulation between them each carrying away the palm in a separate province Upon account of this merit the editor of  Guil de Rubione  in his dedication to the earl of  Castille  calls  Ascensius  a person skill'd in all kinds of science and the prince of printers  Omnigenere disciplinarum eruditissimo  Ascensio  impressoriae artis primati  and  Trithemius  ranks him among the  Scriptores Ecclesiastici  when he was but two and thirty years of age and gives him the following panegyrick  viz  that he was a perfect master of literature not unskilful in the holy scriptures a good philosopher orator and poet a man of a bright genius and a fluent tongue  Vir in secularibus literis eruditissimus divinarum scripturarum non ignarus philosophus rhetor poeta clarissimus ingenio excellens disertus eloqui    c Erasmus  likewise gives him a great encomium  in his dialogue intitled  Ciceronianus  prefers his stile to that of  Apuleius  and highly applaudes his admirable facility of writing I shall give the  Latin  reader a specimen of his poetry in the margin which is a tetrastich in  crib'd to the learned  Fath Mark Benevent  to whom the edition of  Holkoth  upon the sentences printed by  J Treschel  anno is dedicated and of which himself was the corrector in which verses he desires him in a most el  gant manner to excuse the faults still remaining in it  Jam portum optatum per inhospita saxa secuti  Prendimus ex alto prospiciente deo  Siqua tamen lacerae portent inculta carinae  Humanè ignosces Marce diserte Vale  He was no less skillful in restoring of corrupt manuscripts than careful in printing of them with the greatest accuracy so that some of his  Errata  's have contain'd but five words In printing the work of any living author he always follow'd the copy exactly and he tells us in his preface to his edition of  Angelus Politianus  Curavimusut quam minimum ejus scripta quasi degenerent ab origine imitantes sanè non tacendi imo semper laudandi hominis Aldi M R diligentiam  that he endeavour'd to imitate the laudable diligence of  Aldus Manutius  and to print from his copies with the utmost exactness This made not only the learned very ambitious to have their works printed by him but the most eminent booksellers of  Paris  were glad in order to have him for their Printer to associate themselves with him among whom  John Petit  sworn bookseller to that university and one of the most famous of that age caus'd several noble editions to be printed by him as the  Calepini Dictionarium octo Linguar    Origen Opera Latinè  vol fol some of which beautifully printed on vellum are still to be seen in several libraries of that city with many others He had other associates besides  Petit  viz  Andreas Bochard Dionys Roce Geofrey Marneff  and many others all eminent men in their way Thus he continued printing and writing with great applause and reputation till the year in which he died Some authors indeed have affirm'd that he died  anno  because they knew of no works printed by him after that year  Chevillier  gives us two particulars which fix the year of his death beyond dispute The first is the last book printed in his name viz  Alphonsus a Castro contra Haereses  fol and  Peter Lombard in Epistolas Pauli  fol ann  pro haeredibus Jodoci Badii mense decembri  both which editions  he saw in the  Sorbon  library He us'd to put the following  Latin  verse to the first page of his impressions  Aere meret Badius laude auctorem arte legentem  Sometimes this  Aera meret Badio tersa atque impressa per ipsum  Or thus  Aera meret Badio nomenque decusque parenti  Some Impressions have only  Aera meret Badio  His mark was the draught of a printinghouse with the words  Praelum Ascensianum  upon the head of the press the glory and credit of which dy'd not with him but continued above years in his own family for  Badius  whose love to learning and in particular to the Art of Printing was conspicuous thro' his whole life prevail'd upon himself to breed up his only son  Conrard Badius  to the business of Printing after he had perfected him in the  Greek  and  Latin  tongues and in several other branches of literature  Conrard  became so famous upon all these accounts that the learned  Henry Stephens  has thought fit to transmit to us an elegant  Latin  epitaph made upon him which the reader may see in  de la Caille  p  Badius  had likewise a brother nam'd  John  who became an eminent printer and left a considerable number of good editions behind him and as if this had not been enough to have three out of his family brought up to the Art of Printing he marry'd his three daughters to three of the most eminent printers in  Paris Robert Stephens Michael Vascosan  and  John de Roigny  The two former of these are too celebrated to need a panegyrick here and the last took his fatherinlaw's mark succeeded him in his printinghouse with great reputation and signaliz'd himself by the elegancy and correctness of a great number of editions which came from his presses he left a son nam'd  Michael  who did not prove much inferior to his father or grandfather  We find two epitaphs on this great man the one in  Henry Stephen  's book  De artis typographicae querimoniâ  anno which is as follows  Jodoci Badii  Epitaphium  Hic liberorum plurimorum qui parens  Parens librorum plurimorum qui fuit  Situs  Jodocus Badius  est  Ascensius  Plures fuerunt liberis tamen libri  Quod jam senescens coepit illos gignere  Aetate florens coepit hos quod edere  His other epitaph is to be seen upon his tomb in St  Bennet  's church at  Paris  where he lies buried It is as follows  On this side is the picture of  Badius  D O M B Q V M S  And on this side his wife

Benedicti  praefectus  BADIUS liv'd at the sign of the three wolves in St  James  's  street  and his house was so much frequented by learned men of all nations who for conversation's sake were forc'd to use the  Latin  tongue that his daughters had obtain'd such knowledge of it that no conversation pass'd in that language but they understood it the same has been affirm'd of some of his domesticks He was one of the sworn Printers of the university of  Paris  as appears by the inscriptions to his epistles didicatory  Ex officinâ nostrâ literariâ in Academiâ parisiensi  c  Accuratione Ascensii in nobilissimo Parisiorum Gymnasio  Ex Aedibus nostris in Parisiorum Academiâ c  as well as by the order which he receiv'd from the rector of it by virtue of his oath of obedience and fidelity to it to print the censure made by that body against  Luther  's doctrines  BEFORE I conclude this article of that noble Printer it will be necessary to give the reader a caution which he gives us in the title of his  Calepin  corrected augmented and printed by him in that some vile Printers had put his name to several editions never publish'd by him for which reason he desires the reader to see that his mark be to them least they be deceiv'd by those impostors It seems these plagiaries were more modest than some  Italians  and others who scrupled not to counterfeit both the name and mark of his contemporary  Aldus  THO' we have but one impression of his extant done at  Lyons  which city he left about the close of the century to which we have confin'd the lists of impressions yet I hope the reader will excule our transgressing those limits in the account of his life and excellent character as we have done in that of other eminent Printers who have outliv'd that epocha any considerable time The edition spoken of is as follows  GULIELMI OCKAM opera fol  per Jodoc Badium Ascensiunt Lugdun    As  Badius  is the last considerable Printer that made his entrance into the province of printing within this century and of all the other cities and places which have receiv'd that art before the close of it a small number excepted we shall abridge the remainder of this history and content our selves with giving our readers only their names and  number of their works that we may have the more room to open the scene of the last promis'd twenty years  viz  from to in the two last chapters of this II Book  THE rest of the Primers of the city of  Lyons  are as follow  JOHN  de Wingle  of  Picardy  edit from to  CLAUDIUS GIBOLET edit  NIOHOLAS WOLF edit from to  JOHN DYAMANTIER edit  JOHN BACHELIER edit  GASPARD ORT edit  and PETER SCHENCK edit  CLAUDIUS  de Huschia  a  Latin  bible with outs without date with above twenty more without Printers names  Article  III  The Cities of  GENEVA BRUSSELS COSCENCE  and  PAVIA  I SHALL not trouble the reader with a needless description of those cities their productions in the Art of Printing being so inconsiderable as barely to deserve a place here especially the three first  § GENEVA produc'd four editions from to without printers names  § BRUSSELS two edit from to without printers names  § COSCENSA two editions the first by  Octavian Salamonio de Manifredonia  the other without the printer's name of the same date as the former  § PAVIA in  Latin Papia  a noble city and university of  Lombardy  receiv'd the Art of Printing about the same time with the three foregoing according to the date of her first known edition and her productions were somewhat more considerable than theirs Her first Printer was  FRANCIS  de S Petro  of whom we have but one edition dated  ANTONY  de Carcano  edit dated the last  ANDREAS BONETI edit  CHRISTOPHER  de Canibus  edit  JOHN ANTONY BIRRETTI edit all  FRANCIS  de Gyrardengo  edit all  GABRIEL  de Crassi  edit  BERNARD  de Rovelli  brothers edit  AMBROSE  de Rovelli  brothers edit  LEONARD GEROTA edit  WITH about more without Printers names  Article  IV GOUDE  and  ZWOL CAEN CEULEN CENZANO  and  QUILEMBOURG  § GOUDE in  Holland  between  Hague  and  Utrecht  where  Gerard de Leen  or  de Lene  printed from  anno  to after which he remov'd to  Antwerp  and printed there till as shall be shewn in its place We have but six editions of his printed at  Goude  the first is a dutch bible fol the last is dated  § ZWOL a City in  Lower Germany  between the rivers  Isel  and  Vider  We find editions printed here from to all without printers names  § CAEN in  Latin Cadomum  an episcopal city and university and the capital of  Normandy  had two sworn booksellers  viz Peter Regnault  and  Richard Mace  but whether many Printers or whether they had their books from some other place we find but two editions printed here  viz Horatii Epistolae  and  Alberti Magni Compend Theologic Veritat    § CEULEN Our annalists are at a loss where to find this place I imagine it to be the city of  Cologn  which the Printer might not know how to spell right neither do the Germans write it much unlike it We find but one impression in  Low Dutch  it is call'd  Splegel der Sassen met de Glossen daarop  fol  § QUILEMBOURO in  Holland  where the same  Dutch  edition was printed in the same year and no other as I can find  § GENZANO  Corn Beughen  in his  Incunab Typogr  mentions an edition of  Joannes Annius de futuris triumphis contra Saracenos  fol and dates it from  Gentiae    de la Caille  mentions the same edition of the same year and dates it from  Genzano  Father  Orlandi  is not sure that  Gentiae  and  Genzano  are the same place but if it is he tells us that it  is a place in the  Roman  territories more famous for an excellent wine in great request at  Rome  than for this obscure edition which is the only one we have printed there The same author mentions also a single edition  viz Laurent Gilelmi de Saona Rhetorica  printed at  Villa S Albani  but whether it be our  St Albans  in  England  which had the art much sooner or any other town of that name beyond sea of which there are a great many in almost every province is not easy nor of great moment to determine  Article  VI LIGNITZ HASSELET REGGIO  and  MONTROYAL  § LIGNITZ in  Silesia  in which was printed the following book  Fr Hermani dialogus Lignis  without the Printer's name  § AT  Hasselet  a place unknown was printed  Recollectorium ex gestis Romanormm  fol  Hasseleti  Orl  § REGIO a city in  Lombardy  belonging to the Marquiss of  Este  rich ancient and populous had the Art of Printing from  PROSPER ODOARD and ALBERT MAZALI  OF whom we have edit The two first the last  BARTHOLOMEW BOTTONUS  alias Bruschi  of  Reggio  edit  DIONYS BERTOCH who wrought first at  Treviso  next at  Venice  then at  Modena  settled at last at  Reggio  where we find edit of his from to  FRANCIS MAZALA of  Reggio  edit from to  § MONTROYAL in  Latin Mons Regalis  in the Kingdom of  Sicily  and near the city of  Palermo  where  Dominic de Nivaldis  and his sons printed an edition of  Aesop's Fables  in  Latin  verse  fol    § AT  Wartsburg  in  Latin Herbipolis  was printed  Missale in usum Ecclesia Herbipolensis  impress  Herbipoli  fol  This book the earl of  Pembroke  told me he saw at  Oxford  it has a  Latin  privilege at the end impowering Mr  Isorius Ryfer  to print those  Missals  and to adorn them with rubricks We have already taken notice that this book had been set down in the list of Archbishop  Laud  's books for a MS which is the reason it has not been mention'd by any of our annalists  Article  VII  The Cities of  PISA AQUILA ERFORD  and  LANGRES  § PISA is an antient rich and populous city of  Tuscany  where the Art of Printing got but small footing and encouragement It is very likely that the wars which rag'd in several parts of  Italy  from the time of the art's being brought to it might be a great cause of the small progress it made in this as well as many other otherwise considerable cities of  Italy  We find but editions printed here the three first dated and are without Printers names The only one that has is  Antonii Parnormit libri  IV  dictorum factorum  c fol by  Gregory de Gente Pisis    § AT  Aquila  an episcopal city in the territory of  Abruso  distant about sixty miles from  Rome  was printed an  Italian  version of  Plutarch  's lives by  Adam de Rotwill  a German who stiles himself  Stampatore excellente Aquilae    ORLANDI tells us pag that Mr  Robert Frebairn  now the king's Printer in  Scotland  and a particular friend of mine shew'd him among some of his curious annotations upon editions which he had seen the first part of the aforesaid lives printed at  Aquila ann  but said he never could see the second part which was afterwards added to the first The credit of this entirely depends upon that gentleman's observation but our author says that he never saw any other part but this which we have given nor heard of it from any but him  § AT  Erford  a large city in  Germany  erected into an university  ann  and subject to the elector of  Mentz  was printed  Lutreus de anima Erford    § AT  Langres  an episcopal city in  Burgundy  the people of which were call'd  Lingones  by  Lucan Claudian  c and still reta in that name we find the following edition  viz  Jo  de Turrecremeta ord praed card expositio super psalterium  Impress per  Johan Fabri Lingonensem    IT hath no place's name only  la Caille  and after him  Orlandi  have suppos'd it from the Printer's appellative to have been printed at  Langres  However the reader may find the same Printer at  Turin  from  anno  to and at  Lyons  from to  Orlandi  dates the same edition from  Turin  by the same Printer where I think it more properly belongs  Article  VIII GAUNT  and  MEMINING  § GAUNT in  Latin Gandavum  is too well known by most readers to need a description Here were printed the two following editions without the Printers names  GUILLELMUS  Parisiensis de rhetoricâ divinâ  to  Gandavi Orl    BOETII  de consolatione Philosophiae  lib  cum S Thom Aquin comment  fol  ibid  § AT  Memining  a City in  Swabia  between  Ulms  and  Ausburgh  we find six editions printed from  ann  to all without Printers names  CHAP XII  The rest of the Cities and Places which began to print before the year with an Account of the Books printed there  Article    The Town of  SONCINO  SONCINO is a town or castle in the duchy of  Milan  between  Brescia  and  Cremona  and famous for being the place in which the first  Hebrew  books were printed The Christians had hitherto esteem'd such a design too expensive and impracticable it being scarce possible to find artists in those early days who could cut punches exactly enough in that difficult and unpractis'd character Another difficulty which seem'd to them almost unsurmountable was that to cast the letters with the points and accents would multiply the cases to an excessive degree and to print without points accents  c  would have infallibly prevented the sale of their books because few at that time except the Jews could  read without them and to cast the points and accents by themselves and interline them as now seem'd then perhaps wholly impracticable We have seen under the article of  Aldus Manucius  that he procur'd a fone of  Hebrew  types but tho' the Jews had already printed at  Soncino  and elsewhere for above twelve or fifteen years which might have given him an insight into their method of printing in that language yet he found it so difficult that he made but little use of them and I can find nothing done by him in that kind but an  Hebrew  alphabet which  Chevilier  tells us is preserv'd in the  Sorbon  library The Jews therefore as they were the fittest for such a province were the first who set about it What encouragement they might receive from the Christians in such an undertaking I cannot affirm yet it is probable they might in a great measure depend upon that and without leave from the Pope and the Dukes of  Milan  they dar'd not have attempted it Soon after the Jews had propagated this art into several cities of  Italy  such as  Brescia Bologna Rimini Fano Pesaro  and even as far as  Constantinople  and  Salonica  in all which places they inscrib'd their editions as done by some of the family of  Soncino  the Christians who now began to print in  Hebrew  in most cities of  Europe  in  Italy  at  Venice Cremona Mantua Verona Ferrara Leghorn Padua Naples  c in  England London  and  Oxford  in  Germany Basil Frankford Cologn  c in  France Paris Lyons  c with some cities of  Spain Holland Poland  c set up some ingenious artists who engag'd in that province tho' it must be own'd that the editions of the Jews were far preferable to those for beauty and correctness However there were few impressions of this kind printed any where but by these Jews of the  Sontino  family 'till after the year Mr  Mattaire Ann Typog  vol p makes a curious observation after father  le Long  which is that in all the books that he had seen printed in this tongue before that year as often as the name of God occurs in the text they made use of the letter  Daleth  instead of  He  Thus for instance they printed  for  and  for  for which no reason can be assign'd  I MUST not omit giving the reader an account which we meet with in  Buxtorf  the father of a book that he tells us was in the possession of  Joseph Scaliger  of a much older date than those of  Soncino  It was an  Hebrew  grammar intitled  Mahala Scevile Haddas  written by  R Moses Kimchi  which  Buxtorf  says had been printed in  Sicily  years ago  Habuit Josephus Scaliger impressum in Siciliâ ante annos  These words  Buxtorf  the son did not alter when he reprinted his father's book at  Basil anno  in vo This if it be true will oblige us to seek much higher for the origin of  Hebrewprinting  than the year which is the time wherein  Rabbi Gedaliah  and after him the learned  Bartolocci  have affirm'd it to have begun for if we substract years from in which  Buxtorf  wrote it will bring us to the year  Chevilier  p tells us that he saw a third edition of this grammar printed at  Ortona  in the kingdom of  Naples  in the second year of  Charles  king of  Sicily  and  Jerusalem  i e  anno  which shews that there must have been two editions of it before and  Cornelius a Beughen  in his  Incunab Typog  p mentions an old  Hebrew  edition printed at  Bologna anno  with this title  R Obadia Sephorno lux populorum Liber Hebraicus sic dictus Bononiae  But as he doth not tell us in what library he met with it and as we have not a sufficient certainty of the truth of the dates of this and the other book mention'd by  Buxtorf  I can see no reason for departing from the epoch of our latest annalists to assign a new one upon uncertain grounds  THE first  Jew  who oblig'd the world with  Hebrew  impressions was  MOSES  the Son of  RABBI ISRAEL NATHAN  A NATIVE of  Spire  in  Germany  whose family multiply'd so much and receiv'd such encouragement in this undertaking that they spread themselves over several parts of  Italy  and printed many noble editions with vast success and applause Among these a son of this  Moses  nam'd  Rabbi Gerson  after he had printed several works at  Brescia  of which we have given an account went and set up a Press at  Constantinople  some time before the close of this century and continued printing there till  ann  Some of his sons remov'd to  Salonica  and other cities of the  Ottoman  empire where they met with the same success But as their works at least as far as we know of them were done after the year  I shall not give the reader a list of them but confine myself to those printed in  Italy  before that time The editions at  Soncino  are as follows  MINCHAH  Happenini    to Soncini  anno mundi which answers to our  BECHINAL  Olam  Hebr  ibid    PROPHETAE  priores  Hebr absque punctis cum Com  R David Kimchi  fol  ibid    IKKARIM per  R Joseph Albo  ibid  BIBLIA  Hebraica

an university in by  Frederic  elector of that name receiv'd the Art of Printing in and tho' it produ'd but few impressions before the year and yet it is become one of the most famous cities in  Germany  for the numbers of books printed there The first Printer who settled there was  MARK BRANDT  OF whom we have only the following edition  viz  ALBICII  Archiepiscopi Pragensis praxis medendi  to  per Marcum Brandt Lipsiae      At the End of the Pentateuch are these Words  Et absolutum est opus ministerii viginti quatuor sapiens ad docendum legem in Israel excellens illustris  Josua Selomo

Verdufen  and  many more all too well known to the learned to need a digression here in their praise The first known Printer here was  GERARD LEU  or  de LEEU  WHO printed first at  Goude  in whence

Holland  sufficiently known to those who have read the first part of this history for the great controversy started in favour of it and for the number of her champions who have endeavour'd to deck her  COSTER  's tomb with the trophies of this noble art has produc'd so small a number of works during this  th  century if we allow it the  Donatus Speculum c  done upon wooden blocks so much boasted of by the  Dutch  Writers tho' their title even to these has been shewn to be as precarious as that of  Mentz  that the reader no doubt will be surpriz'd that we have not been able to find but one book printed there before  viz  DE  Proprietatibus Rerum libri  xviii  Opus Theologicum Philosophicum  fol  Article  V ABBEVILLE  and  TOLEDO  § ABBEVILLE a city in  Picardy  had two famous Printers and Booksellers settled there for a small space  viz John du Pré  and  Peter Gerard  of whom we have but one edition printed here after which they remov'd to  Paris  as has been said  S Augustin de la

edition in  low Dutch  AT  Provins  not a province so call'd in the south part of  France  as  Orlandi  and others have mistook it but a town in the county of  Brie  in the same kingdom we have one small edition printed by one  William Tavernier    AT  Bergamo  we find one edition dated  anno  and  AT  Bemberg  two  anno  the former is without the Printer's name the last by  John Pfeil  I MUST not omit acquainting the reader that there are still above twenty editions which being without dates places or Printers names were not reducible to our former lists tho' they are suppos'd to have been printed before the close of the th century The reader may find them at the end of Mr  Mattaire  's annals vol with such remarks as that diligent author could make upon them  I SHALL conclude this chapter with this observation that the Art of cutting upon wooden blocks having past from the Printers to the engravers of cuts they began to intersperse them among their works so that we find many histories both sacred and profane adorn'd with wooden cuts which tho' already mention'd in the lists of impressions under every city yet we shall subjoyn here altogether at least the most considerable of them  THE  Speculum  or mirrour of our salvation in  Latin  and another in  low Dutch  THE  Speculum morientium  or mirrour of a dying person  THE history of St  John  's Apocalypse  ALL these are challeng'd by the  Dutch  writers in favour of  Harlem  MEDITATIONES  in figuras quas Romae in templo S Mariae supra Minervam pingere  CURAVIT  Jo de Turre cremata  Romae  anno    and    fol  FASCICULUS  temporum  printed at  Louvain  and afterwards both here and elsewhere  fol  VALTURIUS  de re militari  at  Verona    PASSIONALE  van Jesu und Mariae Leben  at  Strasburgh    Geneva

Paris    LE  proces de Belial  c translated out of  Latin  into  French  to at  Lyons    ALBAMASAR  Arab astrolog flores astrologiae  at  Ausburgh  and elsewhere  SEBASTIAN BRANT's  navis stultifera  at  Basil  and  HORTUS  sanitatis  at  Mentz    REVELATIONES  S Brigittae  fol at  Lubeck  and elsewhere  TERENTIUS to at  Lyons    Strasburgh    OPUS  libri chronicon  fol at  Ausburgh    GUIL COURSIN's siege of  Rhodes  in  Latin  at  Ulms    POLIPHILI  Hypnerolomachia  fol at  Venice  and elsewhere  IT must be own'd that the design and performance of these and many more of that sort were very rude and uncouth as all must acknowledge who have seen them which is rather owing to the covetousness of the booksellers who chose to employ the cheapest hands than to any want of excellent artists in that kind For soon after the very infancy of Printing we meet with a great number of these engravers whose performances were vastly superior to the best of those in the foregoing list Of this number were  Andreas Martegna  in  Mantua Maso Finiguerra  in  Florence Bon Martin  in  Germany Michael Volgemut  and  Albert Durer  at  Nurembergh Israel VanMecheln  at  Mentz Hans Schauflich  at  Nordeling  and many more some of whom tho' they were excell'd by their successors in the following century yet were all excellent masters and whose  names and works will be still valu'd by all skilled in that Art Engraving upon wood became afterwards no small ornament to the Art of Printing not only for the fine cuts with which the editions were interspers'd but likewise for the front head and tailpieces initial letters  c  which in time became in great vogue It prov'd also of great use in books of architecture geometry prospective and others which require a considerable number of demonstrations figures  c  in all which cases the wooden ones are much more expeditious being contriv'd of the same height with the letters and so impos'd lock'd up and printed with them at once whereas the copper ones must be printed off by themselves and with a different press which makes this method more tedious and expensive  CHAP XIII  Of some eminent Printers from  anno  to    their Improvements to the Art and their Encouragement from the Great and Learned with a Catalogue of their most considerable Impressions in the Oriental Tongues  c  I HAVE in the introduction to this second book given the reader my reasons for extending this history so far beyond the year and I presume that he is now fully satisfied that it would have been imperfect if I had stopt there since the far greatest part of those Printers who signaliz'd themselves either for their learning or their industry in improving every branch of Printing appear'd not till the close of that century or the beginning of the next and consequently he must have known little of those persons to whom the world is particularly oblig'd for the vast improvements to this Art Upon this account I have continued in the preceeding chapters the history of several famous Printers to the end of their lives tho' some of them surviv'd even this epocha many years But we omitted to give a list of their works beyond  because that would have swell'd this volume exorbitantly and those impressions are less scarce than those of the former century We shall add nothing therefore to their history but proceed to do justice to the merit of those who tho' they enter'd not this province till after the beginning of the th century yet may be justly esteem'd contemporaries with the former  'TIS not however to be expected that we should prosecute the same method as in the former chapters by shewing the progress of the Art thro' every city much less by giving an account of every particular Printer and the number of their impressions since such an history how succinct soever would be too large for a single chapter Our design is therefore only to mention the most considerable Printers and to point out the great improvements which each of them made to this Art the encouragement they met with and the noble impressions in all languages particularly the  Hebrew Chaldee Arabic  c the first of which had been justly essay'd before but the other scarce attempted with an account of the undertakers and assistants in that difficult province For as to the beauty of the characters whether Roman or Greek they were brought to such a degree of perfection in the preceeding century by the  Italians  and  French  as hardly admitted of much additional beauty  TO proceed in order we should begin with the Germans to whom we owe the Art tho' the Italians were the authors of those improvements which the former were too indolent in imitating for the oriental tongues and even the Greek which the Italians had made a very considerable progress in was still much neglected by them so that except  Amerbach  and  Froben  at  Basil  in  Switzerland  which can scarce be call'd a part of  Germany  who printed an  Hebrew  psalter and  Erasmus  's  Greek  testament with his  Latin  version of it  anno  we meet with but three eminent persons who attempted to print in the Eastern languages The first is  John Schott  of  Strasburgh anno  who printed  Lucian  's dialogues of the gods in  Greek  with the  Latin  version of  Othomar Nachtgall  with the title page in red and some ornaments on the margin of the  Greek  text and an  errata  at the end By the compliments which the translator makes him in the preface he seems to have been a very good Printer He printed for  George Maxill  about five years before His rebus or mark is in the table at the end of this book The second is  Eucharius Cervicorn i e  Hartshorn at  Cologn  who printed some  Greek  editions the first  anno  is the  Hours of the blessed Virgin Mary  the  seven penitential Psalms  and some litanies and prayers in  Greek  with one or two more after His types are tolerable but the edition somewhat faulty The third is  John Potken  of the same city who publish'd there a psalter in  Hebrew Greek Latin  and  Aethiopic anno  to This person travell'd into  India Aethiopia Aegypt  c in order to become master of the  Chaldiac  or  Aethiopic  and translated the psalter into that language and publish'd it with the other versions He promis'd in his preface to perform something likewise in the  Arabick  if he should meet with sufficient encouragement but I do not find that he executed this As for the Printer of this psalter his name is no where to be found in the book  THIS is all I know of that has been attempted by the Germans in that kind tho' to do them justice in another respect they were industrious in printing  Latin  works that were very voluminous particularly the  Decretum Gratiani  printed by  Henry Eggestein  at  Strasburgh  which exceeds all that have been since printed for bulk and  Vincentii Speculum  by  John Mentel  in ten large volumes  fol  In the following century they have been no less diligent and publish'd a very considerable number of impressions  ITALY follows in course where tho' great numbers of editions of the antient  Greek  and  Latin  writers as well as of the modern were publish'd yet the  Hebrew Arabic  c seem'd almost wholly neglected 'Tis true that there had been as we observ'd two  Hebrew  editions at  Lisbon  in  Portugal  one  anno  and the other  anno  and that the Jews of  Soncino  had printed several  Hebrew  volumes there from to the close of the century and having dispers'd themselves into other cities of  Italy  continued printing their own books in that language But with respect to the Christians no direct attempts were made that way 'till  Daniel Bombergh  an  Antwerpian  set up a Printinghouse for  Hebrew  at  Venice  His first work was the  Hebrew  bible  anno  to reprinted by him several times and particularly  anno  in which year he likewise  printed his  Bibliae Hebraea Rabinica  in  fol  containing the  Hebrew  text of the bible the  Masora  and  Targums  of  Onkelos Jerusalem  and  Jonathan R Joseph  sirnam'd the  Blind  and other  Rabbi  's comments  c  which he dedicated to  Leo  X But tho'  Bombergh  took a great deal of pains in this impression and was himself a good master of the  Hebrew  which he had learn'd of  Foelix Pratensis  a learned  Italian  who persuaded him to undertake this edition and assisted in correcting it yet the Jews set no value upon it but  Rabbi Chajin  prevail'd on him to print another in vol in  fol  which he did  anno  and which was reprinted  anno  'Tis not my business to enquire into the merit of those editions yet I cannot but observe after several great criticks that the Jews have always succeeded better in works of this kind than the Christians as being more us'd to the niceties of the tongue especially in its points and accents  Bombergh  continued printing in  Hebrew  near forty years and all his works were highly esteem'd on account of the beauty of the character and impression their correctness the fineness of the paper and the number that he printed which  Jos Scaliger  tells us amounted to above four millions of crowns of gold He made use of the most learned Jews for his correctors His greatest work was the  Talmud  printed  anno  in xi vol  fol F Bartolocci  observ'd that after his death  Hebrewprinting  declin'd exceedingly  THE next improvement of this Art was by printing  Polyglot  works and herein the city of  Genoa  first oblig'd the world  Peter Paul Porrus  a native of  Milan  but inhabitant of  Turin  an eminent Printer undertook to print the  Impressit miro Ingenio  Petrus Paulus Porrus  genuae in Aedibus  Nicolai Justiniani Pauli  praesidente Reipub genuensi pro Serenissimo Franc Rege praestanti viro  Octaviano Fulgoso  anno christianae salutis millesimo quingentesimo sextodecimo mense VIIIIbri  Petrus Paulus Porrus Mediolanensi Taurini  degens  Pentaglot psalter of  Augustin Justinian  bishop of  Nebo anno  in the house of  Nicholas Justinian Paul  at  Genoa  It was in  Hebrew Arabic Chaldaic  and  Greek  with the  Latin  versions glosses and Scholia which last made the th column in  fol  SINCE I wrote this I have seen a fine copy of it upon vellum at my Lord  Pembroke  's on which I shall venture to make the following observations  viz  THAT it is a compleat masterpiece in that kind  THE different disposition of the columns are very regular and neat and kept up to their exact proportions nor having one double line in the  Latin  versions nor are any chasms or white lines seen throughout the work so that I dare affirm that to this time I have never seen a work so well contriv'd and so completely finish'd The  Hebrew  is printed with all the points both orthographical and musical the  Greek  and  Roman  is very neat but above all the  Arabic  allowing for its antiquity surpasses all I have ever seen of the kind and that nothing may be wanting to compleat the whole the presswork and ink both rubricks and black excels any thing I have seen except  Durand's Rationale  printed by the inventor  Faust  in which book I have also seen in my Lord's library  THE  Arabic  was the first that was ever printed and this the first piece of the bible that ever appear'd in so many languages for that of  Potken  at  Cologn  was not publish'd till two years after and wanted the  Arabic  The reader might reasonably imagine that this work met with deserv'd encouragement yet the reverse appears from the just complaints of the author For  F le Long  in his account of the polyglot bibles p tells us  'that he  Justinian  caus'd no less than copies to be printed off presuming that such a work would not only procure him a vast reputation but likewise prove very gainful to him the profits of which he design'd to bestow upon some of his family who were then in want He fancied that it would infallibly meet with a kind reception and that all rich prelates and princes would think themselves oblig'd to encourage it and reimburse and inable him to proceed with the other parts of the bible'  For this he promis'd in his preface to the psalter and about twenty years after in his annals of the Republick of  Genoa  he propos'd to add the whole old testament in all those languages to the new one which was preserv'd there done after the same manner and this he would undoubtedly have perform'd had he not been unfortunately drown'd in his passage to the isle of  Corsica  the following year  'But continues  Le Long  he  Justinian  was deceiv'd by his too great credulity  every body applauded the work but few proceeded further than that scarce a fourth part of what he had printed was sold off'  He says afterwards  'that this psalter being of no use to any except the learned he found it impossible to reimburse himself the expence he had been at because besides the copies upon paper he had about fifty printed upon vellum which he presented to all the kings whether Christians or Infidels'  Vid Matt annal Typ Tom  II  par    p    sub not  C  'TIS well that the author's disappointment did not discourage both him and others from attempting the like glorious performances tho' we do not find any more works of that prelate in the oriental tongues yet I have met with the following one printed at  Paris  in which convinceth me that he publish'd more of them and in particular that which is mention'd in it It is entitl'd  Liber Job ad Hebraicam veritatem restitutus duplici Latina versione una vulgata altera ex Hebreo Augustini Justiniani  to  i e  the book of  Job  restor'd to the  Hebrew  text with a double version of it  viz  the vulgate and another from the  Hebrew  by  Augustin Justinianus  to But when and where  Justinian  printed the book of  Job  in  Hebrew  and  Latin  I can no where find As for  Porrus  the Printer of the psalter above mention'd tho' he was paid by the Bishop who employ'd him yet 'tis probable he ventur'd no more upon that province for we do not find that ever he printed any thing more in those languages tho' he return'd to  Turin  and printed for several years after His mark or rebus was a leak with a  P  on each side alluding to his name  Peter Paul Porrus  as was the custom of that time to find some beast bird plant  c  that had analogy to the person's sirname in order to form a rebus as appears from the table of them at the end of this book  THE next considerable work is the bible of that great  Mecaenas  Cardinal  Ximenes  archbishop of  Toledo  printed at  Alcala de Herares in Spain  in  Latin Complutum  from whence it is call'd the  Complutentian  bible But before we leave  Italy  I shall just mention some other printers who tho' they did not excel in this kind yet oblig'd the world with many noble volumes in  Latin  and  Greek  Of this number was  Andreas Azulanus  fatherinlaw to the great  Aldus  of  Venice  who  succeeded him in that Printinghouse and kept up the credit of it for several years His acquaintance with the members of the learned assembly at  Aldus  's house as well as with his other foreign correspondents and his own extraordinary learning enabled him to print many noble editions which it is not my design to give an account of here since they may be seen in Mr  Mattaire  's  Annals  vol II  THE  Junta  's at  Florence  a noble family of Printers some of whom we have spoken of under the heads of  Florence Rome Venice  and  Lyons  signaliz'd themselves in the preceeding and this century particularly those of  Florence  were famous for their beautiful and correct editions in  Greek  and  Latin  THE  Lilly  was their rebus with this motto  Nil candidius  i e  nothing is whiter  to which they sometimes added the initial Letters of their names and sometimes printed them at length There were two of them at  Genoa  viz  Philip  who began to print in and continu'd till about which time he is suppos'd to have dy'd and  Bernard Junta  but whether a brother or kinsman to him I cannot determine The former having cause to suspect that his works might be pirated according to the custom of those times obtain'd a patent from pope  Leo  X of a ten years privilege for all the  Greek  and  Latin  editions which he should print from that time As the former are all very curious and highly esteem'd I shall give a list of the most considerable of them which is as follows  BASILII  Magni liber de exercitatione grammatica  vo  ann    AUSONII  sophistae praeludia Hermogenis rhetorica  vo  MUSAEUS  Batrachomyomachia Oppiani Halieutica  vo  NOVEM  Comoediae Aristophanis  vo  APOLLON  de

heirs  I SHALL mention but one more Printinghouse in  Italy  viz at the  Quirinalcollege  at  Rome  under the care of the famous  Angel Gallotius  and protection of pope  Leo  who was the founder of that college and Printinghouse and among other marks of his favour gave them a privilege of ten years for all their impressions some of which were extraordinary fine and correct and revis'd by the learned  Constantine Lascaris  often mention'd in this book of which number were the  Porphyri quaestiones Homericae de nympharum antro  c and a very antient  Latin  translation of  Homer  both printed in  Sophocles  's Scholiast and others of great value  I SHALL now return to that famous bible of cardinal  Ximenes  as I hinted before commonly call'd the  Complutensian  bible which is the only considerable one publish'd either in  Spain  or any other part of  Europe  before that time It consists of six large volumes in fol the first of which contains the new testament in  Greek  and  Latin  finish'd in the second is a  Hebrew  and  Chaldee  vocabulary of all the old testament with some other dissertations finish'd  May  the third is the  Pentateuch  in  Hebrew Greek  and  Chaldee  with a  Latin  version of each the fourth is a second part of the old testament and contains the books of  Joshua Judges  and  Ruth  the two books of  Samuel  of  Kings  and of the  Chronicles  with the prayer of  Manasseh  in  Hebrew  and  Greek  with their  Latin  version the fifth is the third part of the old testament in  Hebrew  and  Greek  with the  Latin  version and contains the books of  Esdras Nehemiah Hester Job  the  Psalms Proverbs Ecclesiastes Canticles Wisdom of Solomon  and  Ecclesiasticus  the Apocryphal part of  Hester  only in  Greek  the sixth is the fourth and last part of the old testament in the same languages as the former and contains the prophecies of  Isaiah Jeremiah  with the  Lamentations  at the end  Baruch Ezekiel Daniel  with the history of  Susannah  and of  Bel  and the  Dragon Hosea Joel Amos Obadiah Jonah Michah Nahum Habakkuk Zephaniah Haggai Zachariah Malachi  with the three books of the  Maccabees  these four last volumes were finish'd  ann    July  the th tho' Mr  Mattaire  says that the whole six volumes were not publish'd till the year Every page both of the old and new testament is divided into three columns in the old the first column contains the  Hebrew  text the middle the vulgate  Latin  and the third the  Greek  of the  Septuagint  besides the  Chaldee  which is plac'd in the inner margin with the version of it opposite to it The vulgate is printed with  Gothic  letter  THE only objection against this work is that the Printers made use of a sort of false letter to fill up the spaces whenever any of the versions run to a greater length than the text that there might be no line shorter than another nor any blank spaces in the column The new testament is in a very plain large character without ligatures abbreviations or accents tho' that of the  Septuagint  is different the reason of which they give in the preface to the following purport that since all the ancient  Greek  authors whether sacred or profane were originally written without them they were unwilling to introduce any thing into those holy books which it is certain was neither originally in them nor of any use towards the understanding of them but with respect to the  Septuagint  which is but a translation they thought it unnecessary to be too scrupulous about it  THIS work was printed by  Arnold William de Bracario  in the university of  Alcala de Henares  in  Spain  at the charges and under the direction of that learned prelate whose merit in this respect can never be sufficiently extoll'd  Alphonsus Zamora  tells us that he gave no less than four thousand crowns of gold for seven  Hebrew  manuscripts and it would be difficult to determine the sums which the  Greek Chaldee  and  Latin  manuscripts cost him As for the learned men whom he sent for from all parts of  Europe  and  Asia  to assist him in this undertaking  Malincrot  tells us they were very numerous of whom we shall mention some Among the  Greeks  were  Demetrius Cretensis Antony Nebrissenus Lopes de Astuniga  and  Terdianus Pintianus  who were all professors of the  Greek  and  Latin  tongues and famous for their works Of the  Hebrew  professors were  Alphonsus Medicus  a native of  Alcala Paul Coronellus Alphonsus Zamorali  and  John Vergera  to the  last of whom was committed the translation of several books in which he restor'd a great number of texts which were wholly unintelligible in the vulgate  Latin  These with many of the most considerable men of the university of  Alcala  were engag'd by the Cardinal with very large salaries in this work for the space of years  viz  from to soon after which he was prevented by death from executing several other glorious designs A larger account of this work may be seen in  Malincrot  p and Mr  Mattaire's Annals  p  c  WHILE I am upon the subject of Polyglots I must not omit one great advantage which the art receiv'd from it and which it hitherto wanted  viz  that of printing in columns by which the text and version are so easily dispos'd that the reader may at one view satisfy himself in any scruple that may arise either from a word wrong printed or misunderstood in the one by casting his eye immediately on the other This is particularly necessary in  Greek  works and their versions in which when there happens to be some fault of impression as 'tis almost impossible both text and version should be faulty in the same word the one may be easily corrected by the other  Chevillier  gives us many remarkable instances of this from pag to I shall only mention one of them in which the Printer or corrector makes  Aelian  call all the greatest and noblest men of  Greece  errant lyars thro' every part of their lives  omnes Graecorum clarissimi proestantissimique viri per totam vitam in extrema mendacitate versati sunt  a reproach which neither the author nor translator ever dream'd of fixing upon that nation But upon a careful examination of the  Greek  text the word appears to be  and consequently it should have been printed  mendicitate  i e  Poverty  instead of  mendacitate  lying which escap'd the corrector's observation  THERE is another conveniency in this method  viz  that it obliges a translator to be more concise and to paraphrase less since the exorbitant length of his version would be visible at first sight I have already taken notice of  Aldus  's method of Printing the text in one page and the version in the other but he was not follow'd in it by any Printer that I know of whereas as soon as they had taken the hint of these columns from the Polyglot psalter and bible it was immediately  follow'd by most Printers and the famous  Badius  in his edition of  Angelus Politianus  's works  anno  printed all the epigrams and versions after this manner How plain soever the advantages of this method may seem yet several men of learning have decry'd it and particularly  Antony Muretus  and  Jos Scaliger  have complain'd that this way of printing the  Greek  and the version in two columns had been the cause of the former being wholly neglected  BESIDES books in two languages the columns are very necessary in large folio's and sometimes in large quarto's where the lines run to so great a length that they puzzle the reader who is apt to read the same line over again or perhaps to skip the next unless he constantly keep his finger moving from one to the other which is easily remedied by dividing the pages into two columns This method has obtain'd almost from the middle of the th century and is entirely owing to that of printing the sacred books in several languages and columns This shall suffice concerning this work printed in  Spain  in which I find but two Printers more of any note  viz John Peter Bonhomin  at  Lisbon anno  where he printed a  Spanish  book entitled  Ordinationes  c fol in  Gothic  and  John de Porris  at  Salamanca  perhaps a relation of  Peter Paul Porrus  who printed the psalter at  Genoa  mention'd before  I COME now to speak of the French Printers whose merit tho' late became at least equal with that of  Italy  or any other kingdom in all respects  Henry Meibomius  a German historian owns  quod scribendi genus ut  Moguntiae  in  Germania  inventum ita apud  Italos  excultum in  Gallia  demum persectum est  Chronic Riddaggbusens  Tom p    that the Art of Printing which was invented at  Mentz  in  Germany  and improv'd in  Italy  was at last perfected in  France which is sufficiently evident from the impressions of  Henry Stephens  in  Hebrew Greek  and  Latin  were there no other Printers to be produc'd in favour of that kingdom But this courtry has given greater encouragement or abounded more in excellent Printers than that and considering the care the university of  Paris  whose power and authority over Printers and booksellers we have given an account of under the article of  Paris  had continually over them and the many signal marks of their favour join'd to the genius of the nation we shall not wonder at the pe  fection which they brought the  art to tho' somewhat later than their neighbours For we may remember that  Badius  one of the first who signaliz'd himself in this province did not begin to print till almost the close of the last century nor come to  Paris  till the beginning of this Hitherto tho' the  Roman  character and the elegant manner of printing introduc'd by the Italians were here exactly imitated and in some cases excell'd yet with respect to the learned languages especially the Eastern they were much neglected throughout  France  and tho' the noble  Greek  impressions of  Aldus  had rais'd an universal desire of reviving that tongue yet the French were backward in introducing it till they began to be contemn'd by the Italians who were become every where masters of it The only pieces printed by them in that tongue till that time were some quotations so wretchedly perform'd that Mr  Mattaire  tells us they were rather to be guess'd at than read The character was rude and uncooth without accents  c  for which  Badius  makes an apology and desires his readers to impute those errors and omissions to the scarcity of types and want of compositors who understood in that language  Franc Tissard  a person compleatly skill'd in  Greek  and  Hebrew  and qualify'd for such a task reviv'd those tongues and prevail'd upon the Parisian Printers to introduce them having printed several books in those languages whereas before this the expence of importing them from  Venice  was so great that it deterr'd many from the study of them At first he address'd a pathetic discourse to the scholars of  Paris  upon that subject in which he represents how contemptible their neighbours in  Italy  thought them what epithets they gave their nation such as barbarous proud and ignorant who pretended to give laws to  Italy  the most learned and polite nation of the world whilst themselves were not contented to despise the muses at home but must make excursions over the  Alps  to disturb them in their belov'd abodes there He exhorted them to retrieve the honour of their country and to apply themselves immediately to the study of those languages he promis'd them his own and other learned men's assistance and tells them that he had caus'd some  Greek  books to be printed which tho' cheap would be great helps to them in that study In short he laid before them such powerful motives and convincing arguments that he at length rais'd a desire in them of rivalling their neighbours for  learning His extraordinary merit soon procur'd him the esteem and friendship of the great who jointly assisted this noble design among whom was the duke  de Valois  afterwards king of  France  and sufficiently known by the name of  Francis  I the great patron of learning who receiv'd him into his family and protection  THE first  Greek  book which  Tissard  caus'd to be printed at  Paris  was entitled  containing the sayings of the seven wise men of  Greece Pythagoras  's golden verses  Phocylides  's ethic poem and the verses of the  Erithrean  sybil upon the last day with a  Greek  alphabet and some other inconsiderable pieces It was printed in to  anno  by  Giles Gourmont  and dedicated to the prince  de Valois  and the archbishop of  Thoulouse  This work was so well receiv'd that he caus'd the same Printer to dispatch three more books in that language the same year  viz    Homer  's  to or  The battle of frogs and mice    Hesiod  's  to  or  Chrysolaras  's  Greek  grammar to This last has a tetrastich written by  Cb Rouseau  to acquaint the world that  Francis Tissard  caus'd the first  Greek  editions to be printed at  Paris  Primus Parrhasia Graiae nova gloria linguae  Tissard  was a native of  Amboise  in Latin  Ambaca  for which reason the poet calls him here  Ambacus  Ambacus Argivum concinet urbe melos Quo duce morales Sophiae amplexabere leges Hoc igitur stabili pectore fige memor  which  Tissard  himself took care to transmit to posterity in some epistles prefix'd to the books above mention'd In these he likewise informs us of the difficulties which he met with in procuring Printers who would engage in this new province that they all alledg'd there was neither a sufficient number of  Greek  matrices and characters in  Paris  for such a work nor any compositors that understood or could read that language that the expence of setting up such a Printinghouse must be very great as well as the danger of losing both their labour and money  Cum incussorum sibi hoc munus hanc provinciam assumere vellet nemo nullus non id laboris subtersugeretcharacteres praeterea Grae cos nobis hactenus defuisse vidi ad eorum quoque aliquot scalpendos postmodum liquefaciendos denique ad cos impressioni aptandas tradendosque ut aiebant sumptibusopus esse ad haec ea non intelligere ne legere quidem ejusque insolentes sateri  Notwithstanding this  Tissard  stopp'd not here but resolv'd to bring the  Hebrew  into vogue and to this end caus'd a font of  Hebrew  letters to be cast and the following year printed an  Hebrew  alphabet and  grammar with a  Greek  alphabet and some hymns in  Greek  and  Latin  at the end which book he dedicated to his great patron  Francis  prince  de Valois Giles Gourmont  who had printed his  Greek  works likewise undertook the  Hebrew  It is printed with his name and tho' there is no date to it yet it is plain it was publish'a in the year aforemention'd However as he was the first who merited the title of  Greek  and  Hebrew  printer to the city and university of  Paris  and has publish'd several other  Greek  works after the year  viz  the Idyls of  Theocritus  some of  Lucian  's works a second edition of  Chrysolaras  's grammar in the  Gnomologia  and  Aldus  's  Greek Lexicon  of much enlarg'd in the  Grammar  of  Theod Gaza  in c I thought my self oblig'd to do justice to his merit He us'd to put his coat of arms at the beginning or end of his books and sometimes at both with this French motto  Tost ou tard pres ou loing a le fort du foible besoing  i e  sooner or later far or near the strong stand in need of the weak  with his name  Giles  or  Aegidius Gourmont  His mark sometimes was the three crowns of the Kings of  Cologn  with the th verse of the th psalm  I have been young and now am old  c in  Hebrew  and  Greek  under them He liv'd overagainst the college of  Cambray  in the square of that name and his books are much valu'd by the lovers of antiquity especially at  Paris  He continu'd printing till after the year As for the learned  Tissard  as we find nothing printed by him after his  Hebrew  grammar he is suppos'd to have dy'd about that time  HOWEVER he did not want a successor of equal merit to carry on this work for  Jerom Aleander  a person so well skill'd in  Hebrew Greek  and  Latin  as to speak them with as much fluency as his own language was sent for by  Lewis  XII from  Italy  where he profess'd the  Greek  and  Latin  tongues with universal applause His reputation was so great that the elector  Palatine  sent his own brother  Wolfgang de Bavaria  to be instructed by him and the learned  Vatablus  who had been formerly his scholar was proud to assist him in some of his works and take care of their correction whenever  Aleander  was hinder'd by sickness or avocations As soon as he came to  Paris  he employ'd  Gourmont  's presses in printing those  Greek  works which we mention'd just before in speaking of that Printer The King fail'd not of giving  him immediate encouragement for he settled on him a pension of crowns of gold with many other marks of his favour so that he was chosen principal of the college of the  Lumbards  and in rector of the unversity with general applause tho' he had not yet taken his doctor's degree there At last he was made librarykeeper to the pope a bishop and nuncio and then cardinal by  Clement  VII I shall only add that he was one of  Aldus  's learned academy and that under his care the  Greek  and  Hebrew  tongues were so well settled in  France  as to flourish there ever since  BUT it must be own'd that those editions of  Gourmont  were very far from perfection since the types were ill shap'd the punches ill finish'd and the matrices worse sunk besides which defects they had not cast a sufficient font of types and were for that reason oblig'd sometimes to stop till a form was work'd off and distributed before they could go on Another defect in those types was that the accents not being cast to place between the letters as now but by themselves and so compos'd in intermediate lines as the  Hebrew  points are done at this time they were often plac'd over the wrong letters and frequently confounded one for another thro' the unskilfulness of their compositors  Tissard  complains of this more than once but tells his readers that they were taking all proper means to remedy those defects and hopes in time that those characters would be brought to as great a perfection there as in  Italy  And indeed we find that the success of  Gourmont  's impressions under all these disadvantages excited other printers in that city to procure better types workmen correctors  c  not to mention that beautiful font of small  Greek  which king  Francis  I caus'd to be cast at his own charge in which they succeeded to admiration and soon publish'd much finer editions than those of  Gourmont  We shall only mention some of the most considerable tho' they all came out later than except  Angelus Politianus  's epigrams printed by  Badius  in already spoken of in this chapter and his edition of  Guillelmus Budaeus's Greek  epistles to in After this  Peter Vidoue  or  Vidaeus  master of arts and an eminent printer printed  Berault's Greek  lexicon in fol and  Or Apollo's Hieroglyphics  vo in  Greek  and  Latin  in and  Gourmont  printed  Homer  's first  and second  Iliad  to with  Wolmar  's short notes and the  Greek  lexicon of  Magnus Chaeredamus  and in  Gwinler's Greek  syntax vo  Anno    Simon Colinaeus  or  de Colines  printed  Sophocles  tragedies and in the new testament These with a few inconsiderable ones more were all that came out in  Greek  during the space of years  viz  from  Tissard  's first impression in to which I have mention'd here tho' they run beyond our period to shew how slow their first progress was tho' their advances afterwards were prodigious  Chevilier  from whose list I have extracted the best part of these editions has carry'd it on to the year and the reader will find both in this piece and the remainder of it several remarkable works omitted by  Mr Mattaire  in his  Annals  particularly the  Greek  lexicon and the new testament above nam'd However as  Chevilier  tells us that he saw them all in the  Sorbon  library I thought proper to mention them  THE reader perhaps will be surpriz'd to find nothing attempted by the Parifians in the polyglot way whilst the Italians Germans and Spaniards set them so fair an example But whatever be the reason of this neglect 'tis certain that if we except the  Psalterium quincuplex  of  Mr Faber  or  Fabry  printed in fol by  Henry Stephens  in  Hebrew Latin  and  French  with the  Psalterium vetus conciliatum  in five columns and reprinted by him in and again at  Caen Cadomi  in  Normandy  by  Peter Olivier  in I can find nothing of that kind during the greatest part of this century However it must be acknowledg'd they have made the world ample amends in the next in which  Antony Vitré  printed that noble work known by the name of  Monsieur le Jay  's polyglot bible in which being of too late a date and so well known to the learned I shall only say of it that as sar as relates to the Printing part for as to the author's merit with respect to learning 'tis not my province to enquire into it has not yet been equall'd by any work publish'd in any nation either for beauty of character or elegancy of disposition fineness of paper or richness of embellishment in all which  Mr le Jay  who was at the charges of the impression spar'd neither cost nor labour in order to render it a master piece of that kind Here I must draw a veil over my own  country which is greatly injur'd if it did not contribute to the ruin of the undertaker of this glorious work An intimate friend at  Paris  sent me word that the sheets of Mr  le Jay  's Polyglot was unfairly procur'd from the press at  Paris  before the work was publish'd and by the editor's of the English Polyglot improv'd and publish'd so soon after as to reduce Mr  le Jay  almost to want after his having expended above  l  sterling to compleat his work But as 'tis unpleasant to relate I shall proceed  As for the other printers who flourish'd at  Paris  during this space of years since my design is only to mention those who were eminent for improvements unattempted in the former century I have but few to add to the preceeding The first in rank and merit is  Henry Stephens  the father of that numerous family of Printers whose learning and impressions for near years have been celebrated by much better pens and particularly by  Mr Bayle  and  Theod Janson  abroad and by  Mr Nichols Collier  but much more fully by the laborious and learned  Mr Mattaire  in his  Vitae Stephanorum  and  Annales Typograph  I shall therefore content my self with giving a short account of their great progenitor  Henry  as far as relates to my present subject He began to exercise the Art of Printing about in company with  Wolfgang Hopyl  a noted  German  Printer at  Paris  of whom we have given an account in the foregoing century He had afterwards several other partners  viz John Petit Dennis Roce John de Brié  and  John Hongel  all eminent Printers We have already spoken of his  Polyglot Psalter  which for ought I find was the only piece he did in that way As for the  Greek  it was so little in vogue in his time that he printed but little in it He us'd two sorts of characters for the  Latin  viz the  Gothic  and  Roman  both good in their kind It were superfluous to tell the reader that he was a man of great skill in the learned languages and wrote several curious pieces in elegant  Latin  He was extremely correct in his editions so that their faults are so few as scarce to deserve an errata yet he always readily acknowledg'd the smallest number of them as appears from his edition of  Erasmus  's apology against  Latomus  in which he confesses  Locis aliquot incuria nostra aberratum est  that some saults escap'd him thro' neglect  tho' the whole was but twenty Hi chief correctors were  Peter Porta Volgatius Pratensis John Solidus  of  Cracow  in  Poland  and  Beatus Rhenanus  As he was sworn Printer of the city of  Paris  instead of a mark or rebus he us'd to put the arms of that university to his impressions which is the escutcheon of  France  with a hand from the clouds holding a book Several other printers of that city follow'd his example in this He dy'd in leaving among other children three sons who became very eminent  vid Mattaire Vit Steph  the two first  Robert  and  Francis  in printing and  Charles  in physick  HIS successor was  Simon de Colines  or  Colinaeus  who marry'd his relict and educated his two sons before mention'd and with them rais'd the reputation of his Printinghouse higher than their father could whilst the learned languages were in their infancy there I shall only add that  Robert  became so great a proficient under his father and fatherinlaw that he was able to manage that great Printinghouse at the age of and that one of his editions of the new testament in  o    ann  printed in a very fine  Greek  character and very scarce is affirm'd to be without a fault This deserves notice because there is another of his likewise in  o  which has an errata at the end and is frequently sold for the other I cannot but observe that to this  Robert Stephens  we owe the invention of dividing the chapters of the bible into verses found out by him on a journey from  Paris  to  Lyons  as we are inform'd by  Theod Janson de Vit Stephanorum  printed at  Amsterdam ann  pag the great advantage of which is obvious to every person  BEFORE I dismiss the city of  Paris  I cannot forbear mentioning a most curious and elaborate work which tho' not printed till the year yet both for its singularity and its having been begun many years before ought by no means to be omitted I mean the book entitled  ChampFleury  written by the famous  Godfrey Tory  printer and bookseller of the city of  Bourges  at the sign of the broken pitcher and printed by  Giles Gourmont  likewise Printer and bookseller at  Paris  under the following title  CHAMFLIURY  auquel est contenu le Art Science de la deue vraye proportion des Lettres Attiques qu'on dit autrement Lettres antiques vulgairement Lettres Romaines proportionees selon le corps Visage humain  THE author who for his learning had been some time before chosen president of a college in  Burgundy  and had translated and publish'd several learned works out of  Greek  and  Latin  ever since the year was afterwards admitted sworn Printer and bookseller to the king and to the university of  Paris  but became most famous for the curious work abovemention'd in which he endeavours to demonstrate the due proportion of letters from those of a human body and face as appears by the title As it would spin this chapter to too great a length were I to give the reader a more particular account of this scarce and singular piece I shall content my self with referring him to Mr  Mattaire  's  Annales Typogr  vol II part from page to where he will find such particularities both of the book and its author as he will think worth reading if he has any taste in this way  I HAVE already dwelt so long upon the subject of Polyglots the most considerable improvement of the Art in this century and upon the city of  Paris  the most celebrated in  France  for productions of that kind that I shall scarce have room to speak of  Lyons Rouen Tholouse Caen  c which have produc'd many excellent works if not in the Polyglot way yet in all branches of the Art I shall confine my self therefore to those Printers who have cultivated the  Greek  or Oriental tongues and refer the rest to Mr  Mattaire  's  Annals  where the reader may see their merit and the list of their impressions  THE city of  Lyons  has been always the next in rank to  Paris  in every branch of Printing and if we consider that it receiv'd less encouragement from their princes and the learned the latter chusing to reside at  Paris  where there was a greater probability of advancement we shall wonder that  Lyons  was so little inferior to  Paris  and may remember that it produc'd many valuable impressions during the last century However the reader must not expect any productions in  Greek  much less in  Hebrew  and the Polyglot kind during these years or long after since he has seen the slow progress of those languages at  Paris  and with respect to the  Latin  and modern tongues they are foreign to our present  purpose I shall therefore only say that the  Lyons  Printers publish'd many editions of the classics  c  lawbooks and especially  Latin  bibles there being scarce a year past for a long time in which they did not print two or three of them of different versions and some with very fine rubricks and other curious embellishments The most remarkable Printers of them were  James Sacon  or  Sachon  who printed some works of the fathers and one time two  Latin  bibles in one year  James Mareschall John Moylin  and  Nicholas de Benedictis  THE city of  Rouen  in  Latin Rothomagium  and  Caen  follow next but their productions for these twenty years and after are so inconsiderable if we except a  Latin  bible in to  anno  and the  Psalterium quincuplex  of  Faber  aforemention'd which was printed in the latter  anno  both by  Peter Olivier  and a  Latin  bible in the former that I shall insist no longer upon them With respect to the other cities of  France  which receiv'd the Art either before or after the close of the last century their impressions are still less considerable I now pass therefore to  Holland  and  Flanders  where the reader will be surpriz'd to see the Art rather sunk and lost than improv'd In the preceeding century we find several cities in  Holland  as  Utrecht    Delph    Goude    Harlem  and  Leyden  receiv'd and cultivated the Art yet now we meet not with a single edition done in any of them nor find that any other city receiv'd it during those twenty years As for  Flanders  and  Brabant  'tis manifest they have been less negligent than the  Dutch  for the city of  Antwerp  entertain'd one or two Printers who publish'd three or four books during this space the most considerable of which was the new Testament in  Latin  and  Dutch  in to  anno  and the university of  Louvain  had an eminent Printer  Theodore Martin  who having printed at his own native town of  Alost  'till the end of the th century remov'd to  Antwerp  where he publish'd some  Latin  editions and at length came hither and continued printing till or perhaps longer His impressions in this city are not indeed very remarkable for their bulk beauty or number I find but nine or ten most of which are schoolbooks either written or publish'd by  Erasmus  yet his most considerable work is the  Latin  testament in vo  anno  if it was printed by him as is probable since we find  no other Printer here during this space tho'  F le Long  mentions not the Printer's name  AS for the other cities which receiv'd the Art before as  Bruges Alost Brussels Gaunt Boisleduc  c we find so profound a silence among the annalists and historians as makes me suspect that it either ceas'd entirely there or that their produce was not worth preserving unless we suppose that they were lost in the war of which this country was the seat in those times which is evidently the case of other countries especially of those upon the  Rhine Switzerland  c Some eminent authors have told us that they purchas'd some of those valuable pieces which had been plunder'd by the soldiers during the wars out of the libraries of the monks and others If this be fact 'tis strange that  Louvain  which calls itself the  maiden city  because it was never taken by any foreign power should not have preserv'd some more valuable impressions than those of  Theod Martin  just mention'd However to do justice to the  Low Countries  and  Holland  especially I must say that how negligent soever they were at first in this respect they have sufficiently oblig'd the world since by their improvements to this Art nor need I tell the reader how much they have excell'd the English in the goodness of their paper beauty and variety of characters and in elegance and correctness of composition in short how they have equall'd any nation of  Europe  in every branch of Printing since In the second volume we shall shew what improvements they have made to the mechanic part of it and in particular to the Printingpress chases  c  the former of which is so compleat as scarce to admit a greater degree of perfection  HERE I cannot but observe the strange vicissitudes that have attended this Art since its first invention We have seen how diligent the Italian nation has been in improving it what quick progress they made in it and to what a degree of perfection they brought it even before the close of the th century whereas scarce any nation in  Europe  has neglected it more within these hundred years having suffer'd their elegant Roman and Italick to degenerate and are become very careless in their compositions ornaments  c  so that they are almost inferior to any country in all the branches of Printing The French on the contrary who did not introduce the fine  Venetian Roman Italick  and  Greek  'till late in the  th century have been allow'd the best Printers 'till  Elzevir  arose since which time the Dutch who were by far the latest of any nation in  Europe  in bringing it to the perfection which their neighbours had have been lately superior to all I shall say but little of  England  where every reader is already sensible what rank our Printers here deserve with respect to other countries but 'tis with the utmost regret that I observe our nation which took so much pains to have the Art brought over in its earliest days and cultivated it with so much application should have been so far excell'd by the French and Dutch Printers and even by those of our own nation who liv'd a century and a half ago But were the reader conscious of the disadvantages we labour under and the small Profit we reap from our labour he would rather be apt to wonder that any of us have been able to keep it up to that degree of perfection it is still in I could easily make it appear from whence these difficulties arise This complaint which is far from being new the  Latin  reader will find elegantly express'd above years ago by  Cornelius Kelian  one of the great  Plantine  's correctors in an epigram of sixteen verses which I have subjoin'd at the bottom of the page  Typographus Mercenarius  Arte mea varias excudo Typographus artes  Ars tamen haec tenues artifici addit opes  Rite characteres ad justam redigo normam  Constet ut ex aequis pagina versiculis  Incisas nigra fuligine tingo figuras  Callosa prelum volvo trahoque manu  Eece iterum hesternus ruihi adest labor actus in orbem  Quas struxi formas destruo inde struo  Diruo aedifico vigilatus transigo noctes  Sollicitam cruciat cura premitque labor  Verum quid prosunt curae durique labores  Cum misero pateat semita nulla lucri  Noster alit sudor numatos locupletes  Qui nostra  redimunt quique locant operas  Noster alit sudor te Bipliopola tuique  Consimiles quibus est vile laboris opus  However this I may modestly say for our selves that whenever we have met with sufficient encouragement we have demonstrated our capacity by printing as beautiful and correct impressions as any of our neighbours  BUT to return from this digression which I hope will merit the reader's pardon I shall now mention some cities in other kingdoms which receiv'd the Art after the th century and conclude this chapter with some remarks on the success of it in other parts of the world  HITHERTO we have not seen that any Printer ventur'd farther North than the empire of  Germany  As for the kingdoms of  Poland Sweden  Denmark  c they imported books from  Germany  and other countries and transmitted any works thither which they wanted to have printed I can find no city in those parts except  Cracow  the metropolis of  Poland  that receiv'd it so soon as and even in this we have but one inconsiderable impression done in  viz  a diary of  Sigismund  the king of  Poland  's nuptials printed by one  Jerom Victor  in to I shall therefore pass over to  Turky  were we find some of the dispers'd  Jews  of  Soncino  and particularly Rabbi  Gerson  who as we gave an account under the article of that place brought the art to  Constantinople  whilst others settled at  Thessalonica  and other parts of which we have but a small account and carry'd on the business of printing with good success But it must not be suppos'd that the  Turks  invited them or any other Printers thither much less that they gave them any other encouragement than a large toleration On the contrary we have shewn in a former chapter how Sultan  Bajazet  II publish'd an edict in against the use of printed books under pain of death which edict was afterwards confirm'd by  Selim  I his son The encouragement therefore which they receiv'd was from the  Christians  and  Jews  the latter undoubtedly were pleas'd to have their own books at a more moderate rate than when they were only transcrib'd and the former being willing not only to have the old Testament printed by them more correct than the editions of  Christian  Printers but likewise to have it dispers'd among the  Turks Indians  c who were wholly ignorant of those important truths contain'd in it spar'd no cost to purchase them Besides this their  Targums Talmud  and other  Rabbinical  learning were brought up by the  Christians  to furnish themselves with what arguments they cou'd against that poor infatuated people out of their own books And perhaps this might be the main motive which induc'd those two Sultans to publish so severe an edict against printing any books in the  Turkish  language since the aversion of that nation to almost every branch of learning and especially the religious is sufficiently known  I FIND however but three editions of the sacred books printed in that emperor's territories during these twenty years  viz  at  Constantinople  THE book of  Tobit  in  Hebrew  without points in to in  THE book of  Esther  in  Hebrew  with the commentary of Rab  Isaac Armah  to  And at  Thessalonica  THE book of  Psalms Proverbs Job  and  Daniel  in  Hebrew  with the commentary of R  Rasi  in fol in Besides these three editions which are all that Mr  Mattaire  has given us out of father  Le Long  's  Bibliothec sacr Chevilier  pag mentions some others which I shall here subjoin  viz  ONE at  Constantinople  in  Chevilier  does not tell us what it is    Jad Khasakkah  fol  ibid      Josippus Ben Gorion  fol  THE two last M  Simon  tells us he made use of in his  critical  history of the Old Testament    Berescith Rabbah  of Rab  Bar Nachman  fol  Constantinople    THIS book is now in the  Sorbon  library  THO' these be all that we can yet find to have been printed in  Turky  from to yet I cannot persuade myself that they were all which the  Jews  printed there but am apt to believe that they were bought up by the eastern  Christians Jews  c and carried to the remote parts of  Asia  and  Africa  whilst the  Jews  of  Soncino  and others were grown so numerous as to supply those countries with works of that kind However that be I do not find that this art made any further progress in these parts of the world during this space or at least that those authors who have represented its advances greater have been much depended on by those that wrote after them and therefore I think myself obliged to stop here  I HAVE already transgress'd my propos'd limits as often as the life of any eminent Printer has extended beyond them or any material occurrence happen'd worthy of the reader's notice Agreeable to which liberty I shall now close this chapter with some remarks on the success which attended the art tho' at some distance of time from the year First 'tis observable that it has extended itself to  Africa  and  America  not indeed at the invitation of the natives especially of  America  but by means of the  Europeans  and particularly of the  Spanish  missionaries who carry'd it to the latter for their ends where it has throve tho' not flourish'd ever since The  Romish  society  de propagando fide  gives us an account of printinghouses being set up in the cities of  Goa Rachol  in the country of  Salsetta Manella  the metropolis of the  Philippine  islands  c  in the first of which were printed the two following works  viz Doctrina Christiana lingua Malabarica Tamul et litteris Malabaris in collegio Goano  This edition was in  Scaliger  's possession and is now among those which he bequeath'd to the university of  Leyden  The other is part of  Confucius  's works printed likewise at  Goa  in a copy of which is now in the emperor's library at  Vienna  We find also some printinghouses set up about this time in the city of  Lima  capital of the empire of  Peru  and in several cities of the kingdom of  Mexico  I shall only add that our honourable society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts having heard of the good success which Mr  Zidgenbalgh  and Mr  Grundler  two  Danish  missionaries sent to the coast of  Tanquebar  by his  Danish  majesty had in converting a great number of the natives of that country to the christian faith were pleas'd to send them the whole apparatus of a printinghouse with proper workmen and large quantities of paper which they thankfully receiv'd and immediately set to work having since printed a fine quarto New Testament prayerbooks catechisms  c  in  Portuguese  and several eastern languages and characters for the promoting of their pious design  To return again to  Europe  the Printers who first introduc'd the art into  Muscovy  about were less successful That nation was too little friendly to learning to give it any encourgement and even suffer'd both the printinghouse and its whole apparatus to be burn'd and destroy'd without ever enquiring after the authors of the mischief The famous  Thevet  historiographer to  Henry  III of  France  and a great traveller gives us the following account of it  'As for the Art of Printing they the  Muscovites  had not the use of it till when it was discover'd to them by a  Russian  merchant who bought a number of types  c  with which many neat editions were printed Nevertheless as they are a very superstitious nation and apt to raise scruples  without any foundation in which they imitate their followers of the  Greek  church some of them hir'd several fellows privately to burn all their characters apprehending that printing might make some change or confusion in their religion And yet not the least enquiry or prosecution was made after this either by the prince or his Subjects'  But since that time they have admitted it into their metropolis of  Moscow  and elsewhere in the last century tho' they print but little and sell at excessive rates  I HAVE already hinted that the emperor of  Ethiopia  and monarch of those christians that are commonly known by the name of  Abyssines  who is falsly call'd by some writers  Prester John  wrote a letter in to Don  Manuel  king of  Portugal  and another in to his successor  John  III which letters are to be seen in the  Hispania illustrata  translated by  Paul Jovius  tom p in which he desires those princes to send him some of the most curious artificers of  Europe  and in the latter he says thus  'I entreat you my lord and brother to send me some workmen to carve images to cast books make swords and all sorts of weapons likewise masons carpenters physicians surgeons apothecaries coiners of gold and silver and persons who understand how to extract gold silver and copper out of the mines to cover houses with lead to make shields and muskets and in short all sorts of necessary workmen'  What success these letters had and whether king  John  answer'd his request in any of these particulars I cannot determine But the second tome of the  Abyssine  history by  Job Ludolph  or rather the commentator upon it informs us that when  Abba Gregory Abyssin  saw the library of father  Alphonso Mendez  a jesuit whom the pope had sent into  Ethiopia  in quality of patriarch in he could not forbear extolling that art which had produc'd so many books and  esteeming it as a sacred invention worthy to be plac'd among the regalia of the greatest princes  Existimasse Typographiam seu sacrum quoddam inventum inter Regalia principum haberi Vide  Chevil  p  By this it seems that printing had been wholly unknown to them at that time and consequently that it was never sent thither by the king of  Portugal  or any other However our knowledge is very imperfect of those remote parts of  Africa  and  even of those which are nearer as  Morocco Fez  c we can only say that 'tis certain they receiv'd the art early from their neighbours the  Spaniards  or  Portuguese  and encourag'd it for a considerable time yet whatever be the reason scarce any footsteps of it now remain if we believe Mr  S Olon  the  French  king's embassador to the king of  Morocco  who in his present state of that empire printed in assures us that there is scarce one printinghouse left in it He adds that it is a piece of religion among them not to suffer any corn horses or books to be exported and that their fondness for books is the greater by reason of their scarcity since there is hardly a press in the whole empire  WE read of some attempts made by the missionaries in  Persiae  to introduce printing there which prov'd ineffectual I shall say nothing here of the kingdoms of  China  and  Japan  nor of their manner of printing having already spoken of it upon another account in the first book of this history  CHAP VIII  Of the Abuses of the  Art  of  Printing  IT would have been very wonderful if the encouragement which that art receiv'd from the great and learned should not have induc'd at the same time some persons whose ignorance and avarice would not permit them to aim at that degree of perfection which they saw others arrive at to engage in base methods of enjoying the fruit of their ingenuity and diligence without the trouble of imitating them in it We have already given occasionally some accounts of these practices in counterfeiting the works names and marks of the best Printers who have been oblig'd to remonstrate against them to the world For as soon as they had publish'd a curious and correct edition with prodigious charge and labour some of these pyrates immediately printed another after it tho' in every respect inferior to the former and either by underselling defrauded them of the reward of their care and expence or by counterfeiting their names and marks destroy'd their reputation  By these abuses they were oblig'd to make many fruitless attempts in order to suppress these counterfeits and at last to have recourse to the higher powers for priviledges and patents the only effectual way to prevent such practices We have likewise hinted that some of these pests of learning have impos'd upon the world by selling their impressions as done at  Venice  or some other famous place or pretending they were printed  characteribus Venetianis  with  Venetian  characters  c  tho' they were the production of some obscure place and printer whose only aim was profit  ANOTHER abuse consequent upon this was the counterfeiting of dates For when by the care of a  Froben  a  Badius  or some other eminent Printer the world was so far appriz'd of these counterfeits that the authors of them could not vend their impressions they immediately reprinted the title page perhaps with some alteration put a new date and sometimes a new name to it and so pass'd them off for new editions To recommend them the more to the buyers they generally asserted them to be newly revis'd diligently compared with the best MSS corrected in above places and the like It was with great difficulty that these abuses were detected in such a manner as to make the world aware of them The complaints of the learned and their vain efforts to remedy such inconveniences are too well known to be mention'd here I shall pass to another equally shameful and dangerous abuse  viz  printing of leud infamous books of which the learned  Gerson  among many others complains with great zeal and mentions particularly a romance intitled the  Romance of the Rose  compos'd in of which he said that if he was the master of the last copy he would rather choose to burn it than part with it at any price  Si esset mihi Liber Romancii de Rosa qui esset unicus valeret mille pecuniarum libras comburerem potius quam venderem    Pastor fido  is a poem almost universally known which we are told by  J Nicius Erith  caus'd many virgins and marry'd women to prostitute their honour Yet great numbers of a much more pernicious nature have been publish'd in those times I shall only mention one which I esteem a masterpiece in that kind heighten'd by the art of engraving that it might be a consummate piece of the most scandalous lewdness in nature  George Vasari  in the lives  of the  Italian  painters gives us this short account of it that  Julius Romanus  the most celebrated painter of his age invented above fourscore designs which he caus'd to be engraven on wood while  Peter Aretine  a great Libertine and Atheist compos'd a sonnet for each of the prints This vile performance was published about the year I shall conlude with  Vasari  's character of it  Io non so qual fusse piu o brutto le spettacolo de i desegni di Giulo ali' occhio o  le parole dell' Aretino a gl'erechi  Vite ad Pittori  part p  that he knew not which was most brutish and shocking the design of  Julius  to the eye or the verses of  Aretine  to the ear  This same avarice which prompted Printers to undertake such infamous works as the foregoing induc'd them to abuse thei  art in another respect  viz  in printing scandalous and defamatory libels' to the shame of their profession and the regret of the virtuous As printing and the reformation begun about the same time the former was prostituted by the meaner sort who printed the vilest forgeries on each tho' that which was uppermost acted most flagrantly when the other was oblig'd to work covertly But as this and the last do not so properly fall within my province as a Printer I shall content myself with having just mention'd them with abhorrence of such practices and return to some other abuses  THE next arose from want of good correctors for persons of that class were thought too chargeable by many Printers who therefore made use of illiterate fellows whom they could hire much cheaper or which often happen'd us'd none at all It will easily be imagin'd what a number of wretched editions the world must have been pester'd with by this sordid neglect However as books were not yet so plentifully propagated as to suffice the number of students there wanted not persons either dull or poor enough to purchase them especially upon a small abatement of the common price This made some Printers designedly suppress the errata which would have inevitably endanger'd the sale of such books tho' others were oblig'd by the authors or editors to print them at the end of their works The reader will no doubt be surpriz'd to hear of some of them so prodigiously large as to be scarce credible We have a remarkable instance in the works of  John Francis Picus de Mirandula  printed at  Strasburgh  for the first time in by  John Kroblouch  a man of some note and at the charges of  Matthias Schurrer  another eminent Printer of that place who styl'd himself master of arts This edition was so faulty that the author was oblig'd to make an errata of fifteen pages in filio tho' the book was but a thin small folio Were I to trespass the bounds of this period I could mention some which amounted to fourscore and eight pages even in  Venice  itself where  Bellarmin  who had been very unsuccessful in the former impressions of his polemick works sent them in order to have them more correctly printed tho' quite the reverse happen'd  Rome Paris Lyons  c have been no less complain'd of upon this account The learned  Mich Fernus  who with prodigious labour had collected and revis'd the works of bishop  Campanus  was so provok'd to see them so incorrect that he put an errata in the edition of  Rome  with this surprizing title at the head  Vix ex stulto demens idemque ex de  Libros Romae primas imprime Corruptorum recognitio    'If you have a mind to show yourself compleatly foolish and mad print your books at  Rome  first  c  '  Gaguinus  was not less displeas'd to see his  history of France  printed at  Paris  with such a vast number of faults that he thought it impossible to add an errata to it He therefore sent it to  Lyons  to be reprinted and tells the bishop of  Mascon  to whom he intrusted the revising of it that he wish'd he could get all the copies of the first in order to burn them The like complaints against the Printers he repeats in another edition at  Paris  in and wishes these incorrect and mutilated editions could be condemn'd to perpetual oblivion  Galatinus  's book  De Arcanis Catholicae Veritatis  printed at  Ortona  by  Jerom Soncino  in was so wretchedly maim'd by the Printer that the author inveigh'd vehemently against all Printers in general accusing them in his th book of  adulterating and corrupting the best copies tho' ever so accurately written in such a manner that it is impossible to mend them  But the Printers sufficiently reveng'd themselves on him by reprinting tho' long after his death the  Pugio Fidei  written by  Raymund Martin  a  Dominican  fryer in against the  Jews  in which edition they unjustly accuse  Galatinus  of having taken the best part of his book out of this tho'  Galatinus  does ingeniously own in his preface that he had taken the greatest part of his book  out of it  Paul Middleburgh  a learned Dutchman of the university of  Louvain  and afterwards bishop of  Fosembrona  in  Italy  having wrote a Treatise about keeping Easter which he call'd  Paulina  gave it to a Printer of his own metropolis nam'd  Octaviano Petrucio  to be printed but he committed it to the care of an  Ethiopian  youth wholly ignorant of the business and who probably made his first tryal upon it so that in spite of all the accuracy of  Posthumius  who corrected it it was so maim'd and incorect that the author was oblig'd to complain publickly against such ignorant and careless Printers who says he in the preface to the errata of that very book invert the letters change and transpose whole syllables from the end of one word to the beginning of another and put one word in the text instead of another he might have added that they have sometimes omitted not only words and lines but whole paragraphs and chapters or else misplac'd them extremely We have in the last chapter given an account of  Rob Stephens  who was certainly an excellent Printer and yet however it happen'd M  Le Clerc  tells us  Bibl An Mod pag  that he has an edition of the bible in vo printed by him in a small character containing the vulgate and the version of  Leo Juda  with  Vatablus  's notes in which there is a chasm of one whole sheet tho' the figures of the pages follow each other exactly so that there wants from part of the to half of the th chapter of the prophet  Zachary  If so great a man could over look so important a mistake what could be expected from those who valued neither their own reputation nor that of their authors being actuated only by the views of gain His son  Henry Stephens  afterwards wrote a poem of about  Latin  verses entitled  Querimonia Artis Typographicae de illiteratis quibusdam Typographis propter quos in contemptum venit  A complaint of the Art of Printing against some ignorant Printers upon whose account it is fallen into contempt  At the end of this are some  Latin  and  Greek  epitaphs in honour of the most learned Printers till that time In this complaint he tells us that the corruption of so many editions was entirely owing to the gross ignorance of the Printers some of whom he knew that could not tell the letters of their names  Proh pudor haud rarus numero reperitur in illo nominis ignorans prima elementa sui  The reader would in all probability  be tir'd if I should mention the tenth part of the complaints which we meet with in the writings of the greatest men of that time against the avarice ignorance and negligence of the Printers some of which are so sharp as to call them  beasts and drunkards the offspring of wild centaurs and of  Vulcan  's untam'd  Cyclops but I shall choose to give some more diverting instances of their own and their corrector's ignorance and neglect  John Chapius  tells us of a change and transposition of words which render'd the sense wholly unintelligible in his  Sext Decret  printed at  Paris  in where under the title  De dolo et contumacia  he found these words  Et nuntio ella cum creditur ex de appiurato parati  instead of  Et nuncio jurato creditur ex De Apella cum parati Henry Stephens  in his preface to his  Querimonia  just mentioned tells us of an ignorant corrector whom he knew who wherever he met with the word  procos  us'd to correct it  porcos  and change the word  exanimare  into  examinare  He mentions others who alter'd a word they understood not for one more common and known thus in the second epistle of the first book  Horace  says  Nunc adbibe puero pectore verba puer  but the word  adbibe  not being understood by them they substituted that of  adbibe  which was more obvious to them yet even this absurd correction is still retain'd in some more modern editions To this I believe we owe another correction in the same poet where they have chang'd  sectis unguibus  into  strictis unguibus  whereas  Horace  only meant the kind fair ones par'd their nails close when they encounter'd with the youths least the scratches which decency and formality oblig'd them to give them when they play'd too rudely should enter deep enough to hurt them  Chevilier  speaks of a book printed by  Guido Mercator  at  Paris  in in which there is a flagrant error in the very frontispiece for the title is  Elegantiarum viginta praecepta  It may be objected that this was an oversight but the contrary is plain since it is printed so in the next leaf and at the end of the book  Expliciunt elegantiarum viginta praecepta Parisiis per Guidonem  c so that it evidently arose from their ignorance of the  Latin  tongue Nor is this to be wonder'd at when  Erasmus  tells us in his preface to the th edition of his  Adages  in that some of the Printers of  Rome  Venice  and  Germany  scarce knew how to read This same author likewise wrote or years before this to his friend  Schurrer  a Printer of  Strasburgh John de Savigny  had been so ill us'd by these drunken and ignorant Printers as he styles them in a work of the learned bishop of  Gaieta  which he publish'd in that he took the most effectual way to make them trumpeters of their own ignorance by couching his reproaches in such terms in  Greek  and  Latin  as were not understood by either Printer or correctors His words are these  In istos haud abstemios  a Clitorio fonte longe remotissimos cudatur faba  Let the blame be laid upon those drunken and illiterate Printers who are equally remote from learning and politeness We shall conclude this subject with one instance more After the bishop of  Aleria  had publish'd his edition of  Pliny  's natural history in the dedication of which he tells the pope  that he had spent nine whole years in correcting it tho' he believ'd nine more would scarce suffice to make a perfect edition Hermolaus Barbarus  corrected almost five thousand faults in it Several other learned men engag'd in the same province and in particular  John Caesareus  corrected about four thousand faults in his edition printed at  Cologn  by  Eucharius Cervicornus  a famous Printer of that city in as he acquaints us in the preface But the composer and corrector suffer'd a prodigious blunder to go uncorrected in the frontispiece of that book wherein the reader is told that this new edition is corrected in no less than four hundred thousand places  opus hoc locis non paucioribus quam quadringentis millibus emaculatius atque olim nunc demum in lucem prodire  'Tis surprising that a book should be corrected in so many places since the last edition of it but when the reader comes to the preface he finds but four thousand and the Printer put  quadringentis millibus  instead of  quatuor millibus  WHEN it was found that neither the remonstrances of the learned nor their sarcasms continually printed against such Printers could prevail upon them to be more diligent and procure better correctors several countries took methods of putting a stop to this growing evil  Spain  was I think the first which shew'd the example by a way to  make the composer and corrector more careful in their respective provinces It was order'd that before a book could be sold it should be examin'd by censors appointed for that purpose and compar'd with the manuscript and that all the faults of the impression should be set down in the first least after which they were to write underneath that the book the faults of the impression above noted excepted was faithfully printed This certificate had generally the following title in  Spanish Esta este libro bien impresso y correcto conforme a su original de mano En Madrid  c sign'd N N It was sometimes printed in  Latin  Where they could not obtain such an order they follow'd the  Spanish  method as far as they could Thus  Jo Ravisius Textor  professor of rhetorick at  Paris  made a kind of affidavit that he had corrected all the errata of the dialogue of  Henry Hutten  intitled  Aula  printed at  Paris  in by  Antony Aussurd  who put under the titlepage  Textor emaculavit  The same method was follow'd by  Henry Stephens  who in his edition of the  Pimander  of  Hermes Trismegistus  printed in publish'd by  James Fabry d'Estaples  has set down the names of the correctors in these words  Parisiis ex officinâ Henrici Stephani recognitoribus mendasque ex officinâ eluentibus Jacobo solido Cracoviensi Volgatio Pratensi anno  We could trace this method as far as the beginning of the th century which had this good effect that those books in which the correctors had put their names were always preferr'd to those where no mention was made of any There were afterwards better regulations obtain'd from the higher powers in every kingdom in order to abolish these pernicious abuses but as they do not come within our epoch we shall forbear mentioning them  THE reader will excuse me if I so far digress from my subject as to give an instance or two of the dangerous consequences which had like to have happen'd to two eminent writers of that age to the one by the addition and to the other by the substraction of a single letter The first is of  Erasmus  who in his paraphrase on ch v of S  Matthew  where S  Peter  says  Tu es Christus Filius Dei vivi  had written  Non suspicione proferens sed certa indubitata scientia pros  tent illum esse Messiam a prophetis promissum singulari more Filium Dei  c by which last words he only meant as he afterwards explain'd it that  Christ was the son of God after a particular manner different from that which was common to men But it happen'd that in his  Basil  edition printed by  Froben  the letter  a  being added to  more  made it have a quite disserent sense Hereupon  Noel Beda  a famous divine of  Paris  and enemy to  Erasmus  fail'd not to take him to task for that expression and charg'd him with having affirm'd that Christ was only the son of God by adoption and by a particular love of God towards him  fingulari amore  and not his eternal son  c  Soon after which the divines of  Paris  publish'd a censure of that proposition to the following tenour  That it gave a false sense to the words of the Evangelist and a handle to men to think wrong of the divinity of the Son of God as  Nestorius  had done for that Christ was not the Son of God  by any particular love of  God towards him nor by any adoption or favour but that he was originally and necessarily so Erasmus  clear'd himself by saying that it was a fault of the impression and appeal'd to his original and former edition of the same paraphrase in which they would find the word  more  instead of  amore  but he was too much suspected by those gentlemen to be easily believ'd either in this or any other case  THE other happen'd to the learned Dr  Flavigny  author of some letters against Mr  Jay  's polyglot in which two learned  Maronites  had been employ'd by Mr  Jay  viz  Abraham Echellensis  Regius professor of  Syriac  and  Arabic  who had given the text and  Latin  version of those two languages of the book of  Ruth  and  Gabriel Sionita  professor of the same languages The former of these had committed a great many errors in his translation as well as in the text of that book nevertheless he attack'd his brother  Maronite  and charg'd him with some mistakes in his part of the work Hereupon Dr  Flavigny  who knew them both equally guilty undertook to rebuke the aggressor and in a letter to him  Echellensis  made use of these words of our Saviour  Quid vides f  stucam in oculo fratris tui  why beholdest thou the mote in thy brother's eye  c  It happen'd unfortunately that the first letter of the word  oculo  being either taken up by the balls or dropt out of the sorm or some other way lost after the first proofs had been corrected gave a very harsh sound to it and made it seem a profane jesting upon that sacred book  Echellensis  in his answer  took notice of this and calls him a sacrilegious and  Jewish  perverter of the holy text and without acquainting him with his faults tells him that such an abominable correction of the text was too foul for his pen and only worthy the writings of a  Flavigny  in short he spends near a whole page in the most opprobrious language against him that the height of malice and resentment could inspire an inveterate antagonist with Dr  Flavigny  was a long time before he could discover the cause of this accusation and in all probability might have been still longer ignorant of it had not a friend of his shew'd it to him in the printed copy for in the two first proofs the word was printed perfect The result was that the author being recover'd of his surprize threw the fault upon the corrector appeal'd to his original and to the two first proofs protested his innocency and abhorrence of such an action and took a solemn oath in order to clear himself  Chevilier  who relates this story tells us that  Flavigny  some time before his death happen'd to mention this and tho' it was above years after this transaction he could not forbear expressing the highest indignation against his Printer and corrector These instances sufficiently demonstrate the dangerous consequences of neglect in correcting to the author of any book especially in divinity  BEFORE I dismiss this article of the incorrectness of the press I cannot but mention some of the greatest Printers who when any of their editions have happen'd to be incorrect have made an ingenuous confession of and apology for it that the commonwealth of learning might not receive any disadvantage by it nor the authors suffer in their reputation thro' their neglect I shall begin with  Martin Schurrer  of  Strasburgh  allow'd by  Erasmus  to be a person of learning who printed in the treatise  De Patientia  of  Bapt Mantuanus  But as he had committed the care of it to a negligent and ignorant corrector he found himself oblig'd to add an errata of a page and half to it which he prefaces in the humblest terms imaginable  Maluimus potius pudore nostro fatendo plecti quam tacendo respublica literarai suo damno nostra peccata sint  I rather choose says he to take the shame of them upon myself by confessing my fault than to let the republick of learning suffer by  my concealment of it Of this kind is the apology which the same Printer makes for the errors of impression in an edition before mentioned  viz  the works of  Picus de Mirandula  wherein he desires the reader  Errores chalcographis non authori adscribito Fatemur ingenuè culpam nostram  that he would not attribute those errors to the author but to the Printer who frankly confesses his fault Such errata's not only make some kind of reparations to the authors but oblige likewise an honest Printer to be more careful for the future  Henry Stephens  hath often taken the same method and owns that some errors have crept unawares into some of his editions  Locis aliquot incuria nostra aberrotum est  I should digress too far if I should instance in all those Printers who have follow'd so good an example 'tis sufficient to say that none of those eminent ones of whom we have given an account in this whole book have ever been asham'd of acknowledging the faults of their works when they had any share in them I shall close this with a pleasant way which the abovemention'd  Stephens  took to correct a fault in his edition  De praesagiis in morbis acutis  of  Hippocrates anno  'Tis obvious to every scholar that the first syllable in the word  Febris  a fever or ague may be either long or short but he having thro' inadvertency spelt the word with oe which made it absolutely long he corrects himself for it by saying  Febrem longam sibi chalcographus delegit' tametsi febris correpta sit minus periculosa  That the Printer had foolishly chosen a long fever when a short one was much more eligible as being less dangerous  BUT after all that hath been said concerning the baseness negligence and ignorance of some of the Printers of those times it must be own'd that many a negligent and ignorant author when he has been admonish'd of his errors hath not scrupled to throw them upon the Printer and corrector which I esteem another abuse of the Art of Printing I could give many instances of it were I not apprehensive of betraying too great a fondness for our profession However any judicious reader will easily perceive by the largest Errata's which we have mention'd that the authors had as great a share in them as the  Printers and correctors  Chevilier  who cannot be suspected of partiality to the latter has excus'd them in many cases and shewn that the fault was rather to be imputed to the former But he has furnish'd me with an instance of this which I believe he little thought of in the case of a learned divine of the university of  Paris  whose works having been censur'd by that body and he refusing to retract them he was expell'd that university but was afterwards prevail'd upon to recant After his death a paper was publish'd in his name in which the blame was laid upon the protestant Printers to whom he had intrusted the work I shall relate the story exactly after Chevilier tho' somewhat abridg'd and leave the reader to judge whether the wrong persons were not unjustly blam'd I hope the singularity of the fact will sufficiently excuse me tho' it is of later date than our prefix'd period  René Benoist  D D curate of S  Eustace  at  Paris  made a  French  version of the bible which he caus'd to be printed in fol ann by three eminent booksellers of that city This book immediately met with many opposers who censur'd it as heretical and erroneous alledging that it was only the  Geneva  translation in which the author had soften'd those expressions which were most shocking to the Roman Catholicks The divines of that university having met several times agreed to censure the book which they did accordingly  July  The same censure was renew'd and subscrib'd to by seventy three doctors of that faculty and approv'd  viva voce  by above one hundred and twenty more about years after  Gregory  XII confirm'd the censure and condemn'd the book by a brief dated  Nov  During this  Benoist  absolutely refused to submit in spite of all the endeavours of that body to persuade him to it At length they agreed upon expelling him that university as an obstinate heretick and the sentence of his proscription was written in great letters and set up in the common disputationhall of the university by which he was as it were executed  in essigie  However  Henry  IV took him into favour made him his confessor and promoted him to a bishoprick but the Pope refus'd to grant him his bull At last his seniority entitling him to be chosen dean of the faculty they all refus'd their votes unless he would submit to their former censures which he was at length oblig'd to do by a recantation  in which he condemns his version and rejects some parts of it as being falsly attributed to him This was not done till the year  i e  years after the publication of it  IN a little before  Benoist  's death came out a book in vo intitled  A declaration of  René Benoist  concerning his translation of the bible and annotations thereupon  in which he declares  'That the ground of all his sorrow was the treachery of the corrector composer and pressman who had been intrusted with the impression of his bible that the copy which he had given them was a printed one  here  Chevilier  notes that it was a  Geneva  one  upon which he had made his corrections and erasements which were not so fully eras'd but that they might be easily read  THAT some of the journeymen  they did not dare publickly to attack their masters who would in all probability have clear'd themselves  were of the  Geneva  leaven and printed nothing in the first and second proofs but what was in his copy but when they came to the third which he did not see they substituted instead of his corrections the words or notes which he had eras'd  some instances of which the author of the book gives  and which the composer and pressman in confederacy had maliciously falsify'd  That it were tedious to enumerate all such pieces of treachery but that the result of it turn'd to his reputation notwithstanding his unsuccessful attempts to bring those journeymen to punishment  That his books had been sold under his name tho' he had disown'd them  That the censure of the university and the confirmation of it by the court of  Rome  which had condemn'd the work and not the author was the consequence of this imposture  c  '  I SHALL not enter into a detail of the reflections which  Chevilier  makes upon the  Calvinist  Printers as he calls them nor enquire whether this declamation was really penn'd by  Benoist  or father'd upon him or if the former whether it might not be extorted from him a practice not unusual with the divines of that church I shall only observe that were the case as it is related in that pamphlet 'tis scarce credible that the doctor could have been years unappris'd of it  especially when the censures and libels continually publish'd against him sufficiently pointed it out to him and if he knew it can it be imagin'd that he would have continued so long under all that scandal and the persecution of his enemies when he might have easily clear'd himself of the one and so put a stop effectually to the other Upon the whole whoever the author of this declaration is this story evidently confutes itself and is no other than one of their pious frauds on which 'tis not my province to animadvert any further than the credit of our profession is concern'd  BEFORE I close this chapter it will be necessary to remind the reader that this second book being wholly confin'd to the history of printing in other parts of  Europe  what relates to our nation being the subject of the next book I have given none but foreign instances of the corruptions and abuses introduced into this art  'TIS not therefore to be concluded that it hath been free in any case from them in  England  since we have imitated our neighbours in these bad as well as in their other good examples and therefore as these abuses have been equally common to us and them I shall not repeat them in the  English  part but only request the reader once for all to remember that we have had our share as well in the disadvantages under which our art has labour'd as in the advantages and improvements which it has receiv'd  APPENDIX  An Account of a newly discover'd Edition printed by  John Guttenberg  at  Stratzburg  in    communicated to me by and now in the possession of the Right Honourable the Earl of  Pembroke  THE reader may be pleased to recollect that I have throughout the first book of this history constantly endeavour'd to fix the glory of the invention of Printing upon  John Faust  and that of the improvements of it upon his worthy soninlaw  Peter Scheoffer  exclusive of  John Guttenberg  notwithstanding the testimony of some few writers who have ascribed the first discoveries to the latter I did likewise offer it as a probable conjecture of the ingenious Mr  Maittair  that  Guttenberg  having been cast in a lawsuit at  Mentz  for nonsolvency of his quota might retire to  Stratzburgh  and there teach  John Mentel  what he had been able to learn of  Faust  's art We had not till then the least ground to conjecture that he ever practised it himself no annalist that ever I could meet with ever mentioning or perhaps dreaming of any edition printed with his name But since then the noble lord abovemention'd unwilling to rest satisfy'd with conjectures has spared no pains or cost to inform himself whether there was any impression extant done by  Guttenberg  and has at length procured this curious one which his lordship has been pleased to communicate to me The reader I doubt not will be highly satisfy'd to find that instead of contradicting any thing I have advanc'd upon that subject it rather confirms it all beyond any possibility of doubting  THE book is the dialogues of St  Gregory  in  Latin  it has no titlepage but begins abruptly with the subject itself only at the end of it are these words  Explicit liber quartus  Dyalogor Gregorii  Then follows in red letters  Presens hoc Op    factum est per Johan  Guttenbergium apud Argentinam  Anno Millesimo  cccclviij  I SHALL now beg leave to make a few remarks on this curious piece and to shew how manifestly it confirms all my former conjectures  IT is very rude and comes vastly short of those of  Faust  and  Scheoffer  and the great and almost constant difference of the shapes of the same letters shews it to have been done upon wooden blocks after the manner of the  paginae conglutinatae  mention'd above  pag    seq  there is however this difference and improvement in it that it is not printed with the same that is with the common Ink which made them incapable of a reiteration  i e  of being printed but upon one side but with the new invented sort which was a mixture of oilvarnish and lampblack and will bear printing on both sides This therefore shews that he had only got an insight into the first discovery but was an utter stranger to the last and more useful one of separate metaltypes which  Faust  had probably kept conceal'd from him  SUPPOSING it to be the first piece that ever he did as it probably was if not the only one of that kind it was printed in  i e  about three years after the lawsuit and his falling out with  Faust  so that it took him up all that time in cutting his blocks and getting the rest of the apparatus of a Printingpress making of tryals maculatures  c  after he was settled at  Stratzburgh  IT is printed one year after the psalter of  Mentz  which was done in separate metaltypes and wherein  Faust  and  Scheoffer  assume to themselves the whole glory of the invention so that had  Guttenberg  had the least pretension to it he would not have fail'd doing himself justice by altering the style of his colophon and telling the world what share he had borne in this noble discovery that his silence was not owing to his honesty is plain from his refusing to pay his dividend of the charges much less to his being ignorant of the publication of  Faust  's psalter because  Mentz  and  Stratzburgh  being both situate upon the  Rhine  and not above leagues asunder it was morally impossible he should not have  heard of it On the contrary it is likely that having seen it and observ'd it to be printed with fusile types he might just finish this rude edition of his and then stop his hand until  Mentel  and he had fallen upon the same way of casting them  THIS piece is printed upon the same paper that  Faust  did use which is mark'd with the heifer's head and horns and might either be his share of the paperstock which they divided at parting and which he took away with him or else might be designedly imitated by him to give a credit to his work Upon the whole its having neither titlepage running title signature nor directionword and being altogether a rude piece of workmanship doth plainly shew it to have been of the nature of the first essays of  Faust  and that it is by no means antedated  A Catalogue of some of the most eminent Persons Authors and

alias Reuchlin  an eminent lawyer who had studied at  Paris  under the famous  John de Lapide  doctor of  Sorbonne  at whose request he wrote three books  de verbo mirifico  He wrote another treatise which he entitled  Oculare Speculum  for which the universities of  Cologn Mentz Louvain  and  Erphord  condemn'd him of Heresy and Judaism and made pressing instances to that of  Paris  to do the same To prevent which  Reuchlin  wrote to the doctors of  Sorbonne  and reminded them that he had been  Lapidanus  's disciple and that the university of  Paris  was his dear mother but as all his rhetorick could not prevent his book being censur'd by the  Paris  divines he calls her afterwards an unnatural stepmother He was one of the most diligent promoters of the study of  Hebrew  of which himself was a good master tho' he did not learn it of  Lapidanus  as some have imagin'd  but from a  Jewish  rabbi call'd  Jacob Jehiel Loans  to whom therefore he directs a letter inscrib'd as follows  Johannes Reuchlin praeceptori suo Jacobo Jehiel Loans Judaeo c  it is likely therefore that after his squabble with those universities he retir'd to  Basil  where he became corrector to the

skill in  Greek  and  Latin  to which  Beat Rhenanus  adds in his  Vita Erasmi  that he was a man of such extensive reading and profound erudition that there was nothing so obscure and intricate which he could not render plain and easy by his eloquence  Ald Manucius  doth likewise commend him very highly not only for his vast learning but also for his indefatigable diligence and accuracy in comparing and correcting antient manuscripts both  Greek  and  Latin  and fitting them for the press Upon which account the care and correction of that noble edition of the  Etymologicon Magnum  printed at  Venice  by  Zacbary Caliergius  in was committed to him  For  BENET LOCATELLI  ibid  MAURICIUS  de Hibernia  afterwards bishop of  Tuamo  At  VINCENTIA  for  HERMAN LEVILAPIS  AENEAS WOLPIUS prior of the convent of the Holy Cross  I HAVE only mention'd some of the most famous for their learning and diligence besides whom there were many more who tho' of an inferior class in comparison of the former yet were all men of letters and vastly superior to those which Printers have been forced to make use of in process of time It must be also remember'd that many of those Printers of the th and part of the th century were men of great learning and parts and indefatigable industry able to prepare their manuscripts for the press and to correct their own works Such were the great  Amerback  at  Basil  who was master of arts in the university of  Paris Froben  his worthy partner and successor  Ant Coburger  at  Nurembergh Aldus Manucius  and  Azulanus  at  Venice Jodocus Badius  at  Lyons  and  Paris  and many more of whom we have given an account in this history And yet it is observable from this table that those who were the most capable of correcting their own works did still entertain the greatest number of correctors  HOWEVER I must not omit acquainting the readers that those great persons whom we have mention'd in this list were not properly correctors in the sense we now understand that word that is men retain'd  by a proper salary to perform that function but editors or authors and correctors only of their own works or if at any time they were prevail'd upon to oversee any curious edition it was done rather out of curiosity than for gain For 'tis certain that every Printer had besides a corrector of an inferior rank to revise and correct every proof if he did not do it himself before they were sent to those great men whose corrections were generally of a higher nature What makes me mention this distinction is the grief which the famous  Erasmus  conceiv'd at his being upbraided by count  Carpi  and more particularly by  Jul Staliger  with having serv'd as corrector in  Aldus  's Printinghouse and the pains he took to clear himself from that imputation Every body knows that  Erasmus  had ventur'd to print a dialogue entitled  Ciceronianus  in which he endeavour'd to shew that  Cicero  was more cry'd up than he deserv'd at which  Scaliger  was so enraged that he wrote a vindication of that great master of eloquence in two different orations which he soon after printed In the last of which he addresses himself to  Erasmus  in words to this effect  Did not you get a livelihood by correcting  Aldus  's proofs and were not those errata we meet with in them more owing to your drunken carelessness than to the Printer do they not smell stronger of your drunken cups than of the composer's dulness  He afterwards affirm'd that he met with  Aldus  one day at  Mantua  who told him that  Erasmus  was wont to dispatch as much business in one day as other correctors did in two and to solace himself the rest of the time with drinking of good  Malmsy  wine  Erasmus  was so gall'd at this oration that as  Merula  tells us he bought and burnt all the copies he could possibly get of it and that he succeeded so well that there was not one to be met with However in his answer to count  Carpi  he says that he was so far from correcting for  Aldus  unless it were his own works that he refused that office to some eminent cardinals who desired him to revise the laft proofs of some works then printing that if he took any thing else in hand whilst he staid at  Venice  it was not for lucre but out of curiosity and acquaints us that  Aldus  had a constant corrector to his press named  Seraphim  and then adds  Can he be call'd a servant who revises only his own works for I never did any thing else for  Aldus  whose Printinghouse I used only for my conveniency  He has likewise been  supposed to have corrected for  Theodore Martin  at  Louvain  but it is likely that it was in the same manner and on the same foot as he did it at  Venice  I had not dwelt so long on this nice distinction were it not that those annalists who have mention'd these great and learned men as correctors have not sufficiently taken notice of it Besides it ought to be consider'd that there is a vast difference between Printing and correcting the works of antient authors after a number of manuscripts which have been mutilated and spoil'd by every hand through which they pass'd and Printing the works of a modern author after his own manuscriptcopy who is at hand either to revise it or to be consulted upon any difficulty The former province requires persons of the greatest learning abilities and most indefatigable application in reading and comparing their manuscripts in order to distinguish between the genuine meaning of an author and the blunders of his transcribers whereas the latter may be supply'd by a person of moderate parts and industry As therefore they have been the greatest promoters of learning I hope the reader will not blame me if I have endeavour'd to do them all possible justice and to distinguish them from those lazy and ignorant ones who have been and are still justly reckon'd the common pests of it  The End of the Second Book  The EDITOR to the READER  SOON after Mr  Palmer  's death I was desired to see what was still wanting to compleat his  History of Printing  according to his first proposal and what materials he had left behind I found upon enquiry that five sheets of this last Number were already printed off but that the third sheet in course  viz Q q  was left unfinish'd being partly compos'd and partly in manuscript most likely in expectation of that curious edition which  the R H the Earl of  Pembroke  was then in search after which has been mention'd in the Appendix to this second Book and this seems to have been the cause of his delaying this last Number so long that his last sickness prevented his publishing it  The reader will no doubt be as much surprised as I was myself at finding the last page of the second book and the first of the third book so differently numbred and that there is a retrogression from to but as the signatures of each sheet do follow in their regular course I am fully persuaded that it must have been an oversight either of the compositor or of the author which we hope the reader will easily forgive especially considering that there is not any thing wanting to compleat this second book and that the materials he left behind do even exceed his computation for filling this suspended sheet However as there were but three sheets thus misnumber'd having been printed off long before the author's death I have ventured to set all the remaining ones in their due order to avoid the confusion that would otherwise unavoidably happen in the Index and hope the reader will be kind enough to do the same with his pen to these three following sheets Those who know what a tedious sickness Mr  Palmer  did labour under during the last two years of his life will pass by so inconsiderable an oversight in consideration of what he has done when he enjoy'd a better state of health As for the rest of this History we hope to find the materials in so good an order that there will be little to do but to print after his manuscript excepting where the noble Lord abovemention'd or some of his learned correspondents have communicated some new discoveries too curious to be passed by And this furnishes me with an opportunity of adding a new authority to what has been before advanc'd concerning the first invention of Printing by  John Faust  at  Mentz  omitted by Mr  Palmer  and since communicated to me by an ingenious friend of his It is a paragraph extracted out of  Fox  's book of martyrs printed in page wherein that learned author gives an account of the first discovery of that art in all the main particulars exactly agreeable to what has been advanc'd in the first part of this History and is to this purpose That about the year or as others affirm and one  John Faust  of  Stratzburg  and since a citizen of  Mentz  found out the way of Printing by engraving upon metals and by degrees improv'd it to cutting of single words and at length  single letters that after some essays he communicated his discovery to  John Guttenberg  and  Peter Scheoffer  and these three being first sworn to inviolable secrecy made some considerable improvements in it that  Guttenberg  did at length with  John Mentel  publish the art at  Stratzburg  which was soon after brought to greater perfection by some eminent Printers in other places and in particular by  Ulrick Han  or  Gallus  at  Rome c  From this short account it is plain that our  English  author had his intelligence from much better hands than many of the writers that have been quoted on that subject and it is no small pity that he who has so exactly informed himself with what had been done at  Mentz  had not given us also an account of the introduction and progress of the art here in  England  we might then have found a much more satisfactory account of it than the reader will find in the next book from all that Mr  Palmer  could possibly procure from other authors and records However as to this testimony I doubt not but he would have been glad to have given it an honourable place in his first book had he been apprised of it but it is not much to be wonder'd at that a book of martyrs should be one of the last pieces of history wherein one would have look'd for it What Dr  Fox  says of their cutting or engraving upon metal and not upon wood as Mr  Palmer  and others have since more truly affirmed can be only look'd upon as a pardonable mistake in the former who could not be expected to be a judge of things of this nature whereas what the latter advances may be surely rely'd on not only because it was in his own province and that he neither wanted opportunities nor spared any pains to inform himself aright in all those curious particulars but also because his modesty would not suffer him to rely upon his own judgment till he had it confirm'd by other eminent masters in the art of Printing lettercutting  c  BOOK III OF  ENGLISH PRINTING  AND PRINTERS  CHAP I  Of the Art's being first brought to  England  _ALL our  English  historians and chroniclers who have touch'd on this subject before  Richard Atkins  viz  Stowe Baker Howel  c have proceeded only upon conjecture or common and fallacious reports or perhaps the first of these forementioned authors led the rest into these mistakes that printing was not invented till the year nor brought into  England  till  anno  that at the  Abbey  of  Westminster  the first presses were set up that Dr  Islip Abbot  of  Westminster  first introduc'd the art into  England  and that  England  had it at least years before any other city of  Europe  except  Mentz  and  Harlem  The falsity of several of these particulars sufficiently appears from the first book of this history and the others are manifestly disprov'd since I have seen a book in the Earl of  Pembroke  's library printed at the university of  Oxford anno  However their mistakes were unavoidable in those times because they were ignorant of several material particulars and of the first editions which were absolutely necessary to determine the true periods of the invention and introduction of the art into  England  BUT in  Richard Atkins  Esq  publish'd an account of the foremention'd edition and an old manuscript chronicle preserv'd at  Lambeth  in the archbishop's palace in his  Original and Growth of  Printing printed by order of the right honourable Mr  Morrice  secretary of state The design of this book which is little more than an invective against the  Company of Stationers  is to prove that printing is a branch of the  royal Prerogative  and a  flower  of the  English Crown  This chronicle however of which a friend of his whom he does not name sent him a copy is far from being of undoubted authority since it is liable to these exceptions That neither  Atkins  nor his nameless friend pretend to have seen the original much less to have compar'd the copy with it They give no account when and by whom this chronicle was written and how it was bequeath'd to the  Lambeth  library No author that I know of besides  Atkins  mentions this chronicle in  Lambeth  library except those who quote it from him tho' that author hop'd that his book would occasion the discovery and publication of it in time for publick satisfaction p It is not to be found there now for the Earl of  Pembroke  assur'd me that he employ'd a person for some time to search for it but in vain It gives an account of some particulars altogether inconsistent with the more authentic accounts which we are now masters of with respect to the circumstances of the first discovery of the art so that we may suppose that whoever the author was he has taken some part of his account from common report and from the  Dutch  who have laid claim to this invention I might add that  Atkins  has so interspers'd  the chroniclers account with his own observations that it is very difficult to distinguish them exactly However imperfect and precarious as it is since it gives us the most probable and clear account of this important affair I shall here set it down as I find it in the author abovemention'd after which I shall endeavour by reconciling some inconsistencies in it explaining several particulars and adding some necessary remarks upon the whole to lead the reader if not to a certain at least to the most probable account of this matter  The chronicle is as follows  Thomas Bourcher  archbishop of  Canterbury  mov'd the then King  Henry th  to use all possible means for procuring a mold for so'twas then call'd to be brought into this kingdom the king a good man and much given to works of this nature readily hearken'd to the motion and taking private advice how to effect this design concluded it could not be brought about without great secrecy and a considerable sum of money given to such person or persons as would draw off some of the workmen from  Harlem  in  Holland  where  John Guthenberg  had newly invented it and was himself personally at work 'Twas resolv'd that less than one thousand marks would not produce the desir'd effect towards which sum the archbishop presented the king with three hundred marks The money being now prepar'd the management of the design was committed to  Mr Robert Turnour  who then was of the robes to the king and a person most in favour with him of any of his condition Mr  Turnour  took to his assistance Mr  Caxton  a citizen of good abilities who trading much into  Holland  might be a creditable pretence as well for his going as stay in the  Low Countries  Mr  Turnour  was in disguise his beard and hair quite shaven off but Mr  Caxton  appear'd known and publick They having receiv'd the said sum of one thousand marks went first to  Amsterdam  then to  Leyden  not daring to enter  Harlem  itself for the town was very jealous having imprison'd and apprehended divers persons who came from other parts for the same purpose They stay'd till they had spent the whole one thousand marks in gifts and expences so as the king was fain to send five hundred marks more Mr  Turnour  having written to the king that he had almost done his work a bargain as he said being struck between him and two  Hollanders  for bringing off one of the workmen who should sufficiently discover and teach this new art At last with much ado they got  off one of the under workmen whose name was  Frederick Corsells  or rather  Corsellis  who late one night stole from his fellows in disguise into a vessel prepar'd before for that purpose and so the wind favouring the design brought him safe to  London  'Twas not thought so prudent to set him on work at  London  but by the archbishop's means who had been vicechancellor and afterwards chancellor of the university of  Oxon Corsellis  was carry'd with a strong guard to  Oxon  which guard constantly watch'd to prevent  Corsellis  from any possible escape till he had made good his promise in teaching how to print so that at  Oxford  printing was first set up in  England  which was before there was any printingpress or printer in  France Spain Italy  or  Germany  except the city of  Mentz  which claims seniority as to printing even of  Harlem  itself calling herself  Urbem Moguntinam Artis Typographicae inventricem primam  tho' 'tis known to be otherwise that city gaining that art by the brother of one of the workmen of  Harlem  who had learn'd it at home of his brother and after set up for himself at  Mentz  This press at  Oxon  was at least ten years before there was any printing in  Europe  except at  Harlem  and  Mentz  where also it was but new born This press at  Oxford  was afterwards found inconvenient to be the sole printing place of  England  as being too far from  London  and the Sea whereupon the king set up a press at St  Albans  and another in the Abby of  Westminster  where they printed several books of divinity and Physick for the King for reasons best known to himself and council permitted then no lawbooks to be printed nor did any Printer exercise that art but only such as were the king's sworn servants the king himself having the price and emolument for printing books  THUS far the chronicle or our author's extract from it for as I observ'd before he distinguishes not his own from the chronicle nor acquaints us whether it be literally copied from the chronicle or an abstract of it nor whether it mentions any other transactions besides that of bringing printing to  England  I shall therefore follow him no further at present but examine the truth of the several particulars of this account yet previous to this I shall observe that we have the like account of this affair in Antony Wood  's History and Antiquities of the University of  Oxford printed in  i e  ten years after  Atkins  had publish'd his piece  from which the foremention'd author seems to have taken his account wholly in many particulars of which he has been confuted by several writers as shall be shewn immediately To return to  Atkins's  book which is unknown to foreigners and seen but by few in  England  the author of that chronicle is mistaken in several points in supposing  Harlem  or  Harlein  as he calls it to be the place from whence  Corsellis  came It is not probable that the art was invented there especially by  Guttenbergh  and in the year since it appears the psalter was prinat  Mentz  by  Faust  two years before that besides the several books printed on wooden blocks Again if the book mention'd by  Atkins  and  Wood  to have been printed at  Oxford anno  be the first book printted there 'tis plain that city had not the art ten years before any other because I have lately seen a book printed at  Strasburg  by  John Guttenberg  in as I have already hinted in the postcript of the foregoing number besides  Strasburg  it was at  Venice  the monastery of  Sublaco Ausburgh Rome  and  France  before If it be urg'd that there might be other books printed before that at  Oxford  or that it requir'd some time to get all the necessary materials of a printinghouse the same pleas will equally serve for those other places now mention'd  Lastly  if we admit  Guttenbergh  to have carried the art to  Holland  which we shall shew hereafter to be extremely probable it will be still false that  Mentz  receiv'd it from the brother of one of his workmen These are the inconsistencies and contradictions to plain facts now certainly known which derogate from the authority of this chronicle and of those that follow it We shall now endeavour to clear these inconsistencies or at least to shew how the author of it was led into these palpable errors and from thence to discover the real truth of the whole transaction  WE have already hinted at the probability that he rather followed the reports spread about from  Holland  than made a strict enquiry into this subject This will appear more plain from the following considerations We hinted in our st book that during the infancy of the art  Faust  and  Schoeffer  and together with them  Guttenbergh  carry'd on the business with all possible secrecy till the former being oblig'd to discover it at  Paris  for his own safety and the latter having broke the partnership and gone to set up the art elsewhere it was thought of no  further use to conceal this invention The reader may call to mind that we advanc'd a probable conjecture of Mr  Mattaire  's that  Guttenbergh  being cast at law and sentenc'd to reimburse his moiety and pay the charges of the suit went away to  Strasburgh  to evade the sentence which is now confirm'd by the book printed there just now mentioned where not thinking himself fafe from further prosecution he might really come down to  Harlem  and there instruct  Coster  or some others in the art This seems to be more than probable not only from the chronicle's mentioning  Guttenbergh  and not  Coster  as inventor of the art but likewise from his dating the invention nine years later than it was discover'd which must be ascrib'd to its not having been known at  Harlem  till the year tho' it had been practis'd at  Mentz  from the year or soon after as has been sufficiently shewn before  AGAIN if we consider that  Holland  and the  LowCountries  were the only places of  Germany  into which we traded whereas the city of  Mentz  which lies very far in the continent was then little known to us we shall not wonder that our first accounts of the original of printing should be taken from the  Dutch  agreeable to their violent claims to the invention of it and their scandalous stories invented to deprive  Faust  of his discovery for the chronicle acquaints us that the city receiv'd it from a fugitive servant of  Guttenbergh  who had learn'd it from his brother then working with him and went to set it up there There remains one single difficulty still why the chronicle attributes the invention to  Guttenbergh  when all their writers make no mention of him but ascribe it wholly to their countryman  Coster  To solve this if we suppose this account given to the author by  Frederick Corsellis  or even by Mr  Caxton  or  Turnour  which is very probable we may justly presume that they spoke as they were inform'd on the spot agreeably to the account which  Guttenbergh  gave of himself and of his invention which the  Dutch  dar'd not to contradict till after his death or departure from  Holland  when they assum'd the whole discovery to themselves and represented  Coster  as the sole inventor exclusive of every other pretension I have dwelt longer on these circumstances because they notoriously demonstrate that those contradictions to plain facts universally known and assented to by all but the  Dutch  writers confirm the authority of the rest  of the chronicle since they are exactly drawn from the legends of that nation which were then generally believ'd over all the  LowCountries  and were the only accounts that our merchants and particularly the two gentlemen employ'd by the king could procure concerning the original of printing And 'tis not improbable that what the chronicle mentions of the imprisonment of several persons at  Harlem  on suspicion of a design to steal the art might be done rather out of fear least any of those strangers should rob them of their honour by exposing the vantiy of their pretensions since themselves could not be ignorant of what was done at  Mentz  long before that time  BEFORE I dismiss this chronicle which as I observ'd was unknown till Mr  Atkins  publish'd it I shall give an account which I found in a manuscript now in my possession which seems to be much older than the year when Mr  Atkins  publish'd his account and which a few Circumstances excepted entirely agrees with that of the chronicle The part relating to the introducing of printing into  England  being very short I believe will be acceptable to the reader and is as follows  The rise and progress of printing in  England  The art of printing was first brought into  England  in the time of  Hen vi  at the charges of the archbishop of  Canterbury Bourchier  who employ'd one  Turner  master of the robes to the king and one Mr  Caxton  a mercer of  London  but using the trade of a merchant to go to  Harlem  to endeavour to bring over some of the workmen that had then newly practis'd the art there who prevail'd upon some of the underworkmen to come over with them into  England  and to teach them their trade As soon as they were landed they were convey'd under a guard to the university of  Oxford  for fear they should run back again and there they set up a press about the year    as appears by several books that were printed there about that time The names of those workmen were  Rood  an  Almayn  or  German  and  Winken de Worde  and the charges of the journey cost the archbishop    marks as appears by several papers and memorials relating to this matter that are still extant in the library at  Lambeth  Shortly after there was a press set up at the Abbey of St  Albans  which continued till the dissolution  c  THE remainder being foreign to this chapter shall be communicated in some of the following to which it more properly belongs I need not observe that this manuscript ascribes all the honour of this transaction to  the archbishoshp whereas the chronicle assures us that the king contributed the greatest sum towards it The date mention'd in my manuscript is a year before the  Oxford  edition came out  It may be here objected that the year cannot bring it within the reign of  Henry  VI who had been depos'd six years before but I answer that the manuscript does not assert that the  Dutch  printers came not into  England  till that year but that their press was not set up till then and tho' this happen'd in another reign yet it will still be true that king  Henry  caus'd them to be brought over whilst he was upon the throne tho' the civil wars and his being depos'd put a stop to their proceedings for six or seven years We shall have occasion to remark further upon this in the next chapter As for its complementing the archbishop with having been at the whole expence of the journey it may be ascrib'd to want of better information or partiality to that prelate who might still be in great esteem under king  Edward  whilst the good king  Henry  was strip'd of the royal dignity and wholly neglected With respect to the two printers mention'd there the first is probably the same  Theodoric Rood  who printed afterwards by himself and of whom we have but two editions printed at  Oxford  in and of which we shall give a further account in the next chapter Whether he came along with  Corsellis  as an underworkman is difficult to determine  I am of opinion that  Winken de Worde  came not to  England  till some years after tho' he might easily be confounded by the author of the M S with the other on account of his  Dutch  name and of his having signaliz'd himself afterwards by the number and elegance of his editions which he printed both under  Caxton  and by himself Thus 'tis  ain that the few records which we have agree in the following particulars that archbishop  Bourchier  sollicited king  Henry  VI to procure the establishment of the art of printing in this kingdom that the king not only consented but contributed largely to it that  Turner  and  Caxton  were employ'd in this design that it cost marks to execute it that it was happily effected during the reign of  Henry  VI i e before the year since in the beginning of that year he was depos'd by  Edward  IV and lastly that  Oxford  was fix'd upon by the king and Archbishop to set up the first press in and make the first essays of this art which city therefore shall be the subject of our next chapter  CHAP II  Printing at  Oxford  by  Frederic Corsellis  SOME  English  authors and particularly Mr  Howel  are of opinion that the first trials of this art were made in the  Ambry  belonging to  WestminsterAbby  where Mr  Caxton  afterwards carry'd on the business with good success for a considerable time as shall be related in its place But as they affirm this upon the supposition that the Abbot of that place  Islip  was the person who procur'd the art to be brought to  England  whereas the chronicle abovemention'd which they knew nothing of asserts the contrary in both these respects I think it more reasonable to follow it than those writers nor indeed is it probable that any but a crown'd head or some persons employ'd by him would venture upon such a dangerous project Besides this account of the chronicle is confirm'd by the edition of mention'd in the preceding chapter of which we shall speak more fully hereafter for tho' this comes short in date of the last year of  Henry  VI by seven or eight years yet it is older by at least as many than any impression of  Caxton  's at  Westminster  as far as has been yet discover'd Add to this that according to their Supposition that Mr  Caxton  learn'd the art from the workman brought over from  Holland  we must necessarily suppose the latter to have made several essays and printed a volume or two at least before the former could be perfect enough in it to engage in that province But I am far from thinking that  Caxton  either learn'd the art from him or even came over to  England  with him since 'tis much more probable that he dispatch'd Mr  Turnour  with  Corsellis  thither and carried on his commerce as well as his studies beyond sea I am inclin'd to this opinion by a passage in the preface to the second book of his  history of Troy  which he tells us he translated from the  French  at the desire of the  Dutchess of Burgundy  the King's sister which translation he says he began at  Bruges  anno continued at  Gaunt  and finish'd at  Cologn  anno  a thousand four honderd  lxxi Hence 'tis plain that he was still travelling in  Flanders  and  Germany  three years after the first edition printed by  Corsellis  at  Oxford  nor does it appear that  Caxton  came presently after to  England  but stay'd to write a third book in the last mention'd place  Cologn  as he informs us in these words  "  The third book of the destruction of  Troy  I have now good leyzer in  Cologn  I have delibered in my self beyngto take thislaboure in hand  "  'Tis unreasonable to imagine that a man of his years of which he complains in the same preface saying that  age crept on him daily and feebled all the body  should come along with the  Dutch  Printer and learn the art from him and then go travelling again having one book to translate and another to write  viz  his  Fruits of Time  I am of opinion therefore that he learn'd the art at least got a good insight into it abroad and perhaps at  Cologn  tho' he might make himself master of the practical part of it after his return into  England  THUS far therefore 'tis plain that  Caxton  had been on his travels some time when  Corsellis  printed that first edition at  Oxford  that the latter was the first Printer in  England  and that  Oxford  was the place where the first press was set up The chronicle gives these reasons why that Printer was sent thither Because it was an inland town out of which it would be less possible for him to escape than from  London  or any place near the sea Archbishop  Bourchier  who had been vicechancellor and was then chancellor of that university may be suppos'd to have had a more than ordinary regard for it and in consequence of that to have prevail'd upon the King to honour it with the first press To these we may add the two following  viz  That an university was the most proper place for such a work because it would still be under the eye and direction of the learned men there who could make choice of the best works to be printed the best MSS to print from and the most skilful persons to correct them the city of  London  and almost the whole kingdom being disturb'd and divided by the  Earl of March  's party▪ and the court engag'd in opposing his measures an university was a much safer and quieter place to lay the foundation of this art in than any other in the kingdom  Corsellis  therefore and those to whom he was to discover the secret having sworn fidelity to the king and his successors and being admitted into the number of the king's servants and  houshold began to exercise this art as soon as they had got all things ready for it How long they were thus employ'd in their preparations and what progress they made after I shall next enquire  THE reader will have just cause to admire that if they began so soon as the latter end of  Henry  VI's reign  viz  before  anna  they should have publish'd no work yet discover'd till seven years after  viz  and that there are but three editions extant between that time and the year the edition of included and what is still more admirable that from that year to which is above years thee is not one volume to be found printed at  Oxford  tho' the art flourish'd in several other parts of  England  as will appear in the progress of this history This last particular I can by no means account for but the other I mean their slow progress at first is easily solv'd by what has been hinted before  viz  the troubles which were then breaking forth and fell upon the king and court as well as his deposition which happen'd immediately after their first settlement in that university together with the opposition made continually by his Queen and friends against his victorious rival Besides if we consider that the Printers were sworn servants to the crown and consequently incapable to act without the king's special order or at least his licence whilst  Henry  their Patron was out of power and the reigning monarch otherwise employ'd it will be very easy to account for these delays and the small progress which they made in those troublesome times We may likewise with great probability suppose that most of their works were such as were adapted to those times of superstition as prayerbooks manuals legends  c  which perish'd soon after the reformation  IT must be own'd indeed that the author of the chronicle so often mention'd tells us that as soon as  Corsellis  had perform'd his promise and instructed a sufficient number of others in the art it was thought proper to disperse them some to  Westminster  others to  St Albans  c Yet it is still very surprizing that so considerable a place as  Oxford  could not detain one of them by a sufficient encouragement However 'tis plain that except  Theodoric Rood  a  German  and native of  Cologn  who very probably came over with Mr  Caxton  from thence and of whom we have discover'd but two editions there are no other footsteps of  printing in this university extant from that time to nor any tolerable account among the writers of those times for such a wonderful scarcity But this is not the only thing which the reader will be surpriz'd at with relation to the slow progress which printing made at  Oxford  I have in the former book given an account of vast improvements made to that art in foreign countries and to what a degree of perfection the  Italians  and  French  in particular had brought it not only with respect to the exquisite beauty and variety of characters richness and elegancy of composition  c  but likewise by their introducing the learned and eastern languages as  Greek Hebrew Arabic  c into their printinghouses even before the year and printing several curious polyglot works in all these tongues besides the  Latin  But tho' I have extended this  English  history thirty years further than theirs  viz  to the year yet the reader must not expect to find any thing of this nature done in  England  during that time Our first Printers tho' excellent men in their way contented themselves with printing in their own tongue and if they ventur'd sometimes either upon  Latin  or  French  their productions in those languages were few and inconsiderable but with respect to  Greek  and  Hebrew  either thro' want of due encouragement from the learned or of courage in them 'tis certain they never attempted any thing of that kind till a long time after  THE reader may remember with what difficulty the  Parisian  Printers were prevail'd upon to venture upon such works what objections and obstacles they rais'd against so expensive and hazardous an undertaking yet a learned  Frenchman  so far prevail'd with some of them that he had the pleasure of seeing several of his own works printed in those languages the reception of which soon encourag'd them to proceed in several noble undertakings But the case was far different in  England  for the learned Dr  Wakefield  having made an oration in to recommend the study of the  Hebrew  and  Arabic  tongues and shew the usefulness and necessity of them was oblig'd to publish it maim'd and imperfect wanting near a third part because as he tells us the Printers of that time had no  Hebrew  types tho' it was printed by  Wynken de Worde  one of the most eminent Printers in  Europe  of that age Printing in  Greek  made no great figure in  England  before the th century  and the most learned work which we have to boast of was the polyglot bible of Dr  Walton  mention'd at the latter end of the last book which was not printed till after the restoration by Mr  Thomas Roycroft  of whom I shall say more hereafter  EXCEPT this I don't find any footsteps of any works in the polyglot kind but what were small and inconsiderable However we like the  Dutch  have sufficiently since atton'd for the slow progress which our ancestors made in those noble branches of printing  I shall now give an account of the editions before mention'd between the years and    Sancti Hieronymi expositio in Symbolum Apostolorum  to without the Printer's name  Oxon  THIS antient piece begins with the following title  Incipit Expositio Sancti Jeronimi in Symbolum Apostolorum ad Papam Laurentium  At the end are the following words  Explicit Expositio Sancti Jeronimi in Symbolo Apostolorum ad Papam Laurentium Impressus Oxonie finita Anno Domini  MCCCCLXVIII xvii  die Decembris  There is one in the  Bodleian  library given by the learned bishop  Barlow  who wrote with his own hand in the first page that this  exposition  was not St  Jerom  's but  Rufinus  's  Rufini est haec Expositio non Hieronymi  and in the last page he wrote as follows  Stephen Bateman  doctor of divinity and chaplain to  Hen Cary  Ld  Hunsden  upon Bartholomaeus de proprietatibus rerum the book was writ in Latin anno    translated into English in  in the last he tells us  that Bartholomeus was first printed in English  in and then he adds  at which time printing began first in  England  the th year of  Hen VI but he is manifestly mistaken for this foregoing book was printed in at  Oxford  at least two years before This remark of Dr  Bateman  has another gross mistake besides that observ'd by bishop  Barlow  which is that the year was far from being the th of  Henry  VI who had been depos'd years before The th year of that King's reign was the year in which 'tis probable some foundations of printing had been laid in  England  tho' for the aforemention'd reasons we meet  with nothing done in that kind till eight or nine years after We shall affirm nothing concerning this  English  edition of  Barth de Propriet Rer  tho' 'tis reasonable to suppose it printed at  Oxford  since we have no other account of it but this manuscript note of bishop  Barlow    Leonardus Aretinus in Aristot Ethic Comment  Oxon  I THINK 'twill not be amiss to insert here what is wrote before these two books which are in the  Pembroke  library 'tis as follows  'Here are the only two books to be seen by  Corsellis  the first Printer at  Oxford  tho' there are other copies of the first of the second we know of only this These are printed on the same shap'd letters as the  Rationale  and  Catholicon  by  Faust  vulgarly doctor  Faustus  The civil wars in  Edward  IV's time might probably hinder the progress of the press the third book  viz  '    Aegidius de Romd  alias  Aegidius Columna Romanus Archiep Bituricens Ord Eremit S Aug de Peccato Originali  to Oxon  'was printed about the time of the second and 'tis probable this was printed by  Corsellis  for the next Printer at  Oxford  was  Rood  as appears by the following book'  The destruction of  Troy  in  Latin  by  Guido de Columna  by T R Oxon  THERE is also one more printed by  Rood  at  Oxford  mention'd by  Orlandi  viz    Alexandri ab Hales Angli Sententiosa atque studio digna expositio super tertium Librum de Anima Impressum per me Theodoricum Rood  Road  de Colonia  xi  Octob in Alma Universitate  Oxon  'Both  Corsellis  and  Rood  are mention'd by our historians to have been brought over by  Caxton Caxton  with Sir  Richard Whetehilt  were sent after he brought  in the art  by  Edward  IV to settle a commerce" with the  Duke  of  Burgundy  in  Vide Rymer  's  Faedera  '  THUS much for  Oxford  in the infancy of the art  CHAP III  Westminster  MCCCCLXXIV  WESTMINSTER being the most considerable place on several accounts and particularly for its productions and the great applause with which Mr  Caxton  carry'd on the business of printing there for above years we have for this reason given it the priority yet hope I shall be excus'd for this digression concerning St  Albans  which has been far less eminent on this account and as a history of the two books printed there I shall here relate as I found it wrote before the Book of Miscellanies printed at St  Albans  in the  Pembroke  library 'Tis as follows  'IT is agreed that  Corsellis  was the first who printed in  England  and that  Oxford  and St  Albans  were the two first places the types as may be seen in my Lord's books at  Oxford  were like those of  Faust  the types of this at St  Albans  are like the  Dutch Spieghel Junius  argues for the first printing to be at  Harlem  from the  Dutch Spieghel  but it appears from what is writ before the five books call'd  Paginae Conglutinatoe  that the  Latin  one of this  Dutch  was before it the which he had not seen neither does it conclude where it was printed however this book of St  Albans  affords an argument which  Junius  could not then know of that the  Dutch  letter might be before and it favours what  Atkins  says of a press brought over from  Harlem  in the time of  Henry  VI who dy'd in This is the same letter and we read that  Frederick Corsellis  did at St  Albans  instruct an old learned schoolmaster to print and  Corsellis  was of a considerable age when  Theodoric de Rood  of  Colen  succeeded him at  Oxford  by whom we have two books printed the first as old as already taken notice of It has been a doubt whether  they first printed at St  Albans  or at  Oxford  the oldest book of St  Albans  with a date is here but we cannot prove this book of  Miscellanies  to be older than the dissolution of the Abbies by K  Henry  VIII 'till when a press remain'd and the first letter us'd as late as such a year appearing in this book We know of but one more book at St  Albans  the which my Lord also has it discovers that there was another press set up at St  Albans  after this with the letter of the  Spieghel  because that is printed with  Caxton  's types and hath as  Caxton  's books have the two improvements of indenting paragraphs and dividing words by hyphens at the ends of the lines the Printers of this with the letter of the  Spieghel  continu'd to print as they began without the two improvements even after the press of  Caxton  tho' even here that press us'd his improvements This other book is dated in words at length at the end of the book of hunting besides the arms of that monastery which are at the end of the whole book  Spelman  in his  Aspilogia  quotes the whole book as wrote by  Juliana Barnes  and is so referr'd to by  Bale  in his  Scriptores  tho' she appears to be the author only of the piece of hunting the treatise in that book of coat arms is only a translation of  Upton de re Militari  That printed by  Caxton  at  Westminster  in was a second edition of this book  OF this with the types of the  Spieghel  there is a second edition in printed by  Winken de Worde  it consists of miscellanies and has something very remarkable as the old tryal in K  Henry  VI's time at  Leicester  not taken notice of in our great collection of statetryals of the cardinal of  Winchester  impeach'd by the Duke of  Gloucester  before the  House of Lords  in which appears the names of the mitred Abbots among the Lords spiritual and temporal and the form of the clerks entring as they came in and at different times took the oaths The names of the thirty six churches in  London  and suburbs that were not parochial also of the hundred and eighteen parish churches and their patrons In this is the  Nut brown maid  suppos'd by  Chaucer  as  Skelton  confirms by having had a copy given him by  Lidgate  Monk of  Bury  Mr  Prior  has made a paraphrase on it and has also printed it from the old  English  but knew not that it was by  Chaucer  besides in his each verse is divided into two as the first verse ends with  among  and the second ends  with  it is  c  Also in his  Woman  and  Man  is printed at the beginning of each Stanza here they are suppos'd as they speak Also the last Stanza which makes twelve lines by his division is wanting'  THUS far we have copied from my Lord's manuscript notes before his books of St  Albans  We now proceed to  Westminster  and here 'tis requisite to observe that Dr  Islip  abbot of  Westminster  having very liberally promoted this art and encourag'd Mr  Caxton  to whom he assign'd that part of the Abby suppos'd by some of our historians to be the Ambry or Eleemosinary As a confirmation of this opinion Mr  Newcourt  in his  Repertorium  tom i pag has it thus  'St  Ann  's an old chappel over against which the Lady  Margaret  mother to king  Henry  VII erected an almshouse for poor women which is now turned into lodgings for the singingmen of the college The place wherein this chapel and almshouse stood was called the Eleemosinary or Almonry now corruptly the Ambry Aumbry for that the alms of the Abby were the  e distributed to the poor in which  Islip  abbot of  Westminster  erected the first press for bookprinting that ever was in  England  about the year of  Christ  and where  William Caxton  citizen and mercer of  London  who first brought it into  England  practis'd it'  This might occasion the report that this abbot first brought printing to  England  at his own charges This notion of his introducing the art into our nation which has prevail'd among several of our writers is not only contradicted by the author of the chronicle but seems to be groundless on this account that if there had been any truth in it Mr  Caxton  would have been oblig'd in gratitude to have taken notice of this singular piece of merit of his friend and patron in some of the prefaces to his works  I HAVE follow'd the same method in this book as I did in the former dating the places according to the oldest edition extant that bears any certain date tho' I am not ignorant that some of them may come short of being the first that were printed there Mr  Bagford  whose papers are now in the possession of the right honourable the Earl of  Oxford  at  Wimpole  in  Cambridgeshire  tells us in a proposal he publish'd for a History of Printing that  Caxton  's first impression seems to be that of  Game of Chess  in because it carries that date in the device as the reader may see under his picture at the front of the second volume tho' he owns there was another impression of it without that device as well as several other of his works without any date at all However the oldest that has a certain date ought in reason to fix our epocha according to our method  WILLIAM CAXTON  MR  Caxton  was born as he writes himself in the  Weeld  of  Kent  where the broadest  English  is spoken but as  Fuller  in his  English Worthies  asserts he was born at  Caxton  in  Hertfordshire  being perhaps lead into that error by his sirname since it was the custom of that time for persons to denominate themselves from the place of their birth I think it will be necessary to subjoin his own account of himself in this respect from his preface to the  Recule of the Historyes of Troye  translated by him out of the  French  of  Raoul le Fevre Priest  'When I remember myself of my unperfitness in both languagesIn  Fraunce  was I never and was born and lerned myne  English  in  Kente  in the Weeld where  English  is spoken broad and rudeI have continued for the most part in the countries of  Brabant Flanders Holland  and  Zeland  The Dutchesse of BOURGOGNE sister of the king of  England  when she had seen v or vi quairs found default in myn  English  which she commaunded me to ammand and to continue and make an end of the residuewhose commaund I durst not disobey'  Thus far Mr  Caxton  and I can't but observe that the faults of his  English  are owing more to his long continuance abroad than to the place of his birth which will easily appear from an accurate observation of his language and manner of spelling which discover the foreigner more than a broadspoken  Kentish  man His education was owing to his mother and extended no farther than to read and write which he says procur'd him a good maintenance Mr  Bale  tells us indeed that he understood the  Latin  tongue which is plain from his translations out of that language  But as he does not mention it as a part of his youthful education 'tis very probable that he did not apply himself to the study of it till a long time after He was bred a mercer of the city of  London  and became a  Conjurys  thereof  I have indeed thro' the favour of Mr  Crump  at  Mercer  's hall search'd their book of freemen but could not find his name there There was one  Richard Caxton  made free about that time whether it was a relation of his or a mistake in transcribing his christian name I cannot be sure of but however as he calls himself a  Mercer  of  London  we have no reason to doubt it  as he stiles himself in his preface to  Cato  that is a sworn member of that company which in those days consisted of very considerable merchants trading more particularly into the  LowCountries  and some of the maritime parts of  Germany  To these he was frequently sent but never had the fortune to visit  France  tho' he became so good a master of that language as to translate several volumes into  English  of which we shall give an account hereafter His travels likewise so well accomplish'd him in the  High  and  LowDutch  that upon the account of this and his knowledge of those countries and their trade the king chose him as a fit person to undertake the bringing printing to  England  This task how difficult and hazardous soever he acquitted himself with great integrity  Mr  Caxton  besides his accomplishments as a merchant acquired a great deal of politeness partly by his travels for years and partly by his frequent residence at the court of the dutchess of  Burgundy  sister to king  Edward  IV who caress'd and patroniz'd him very much for in the preface abovemention'd he tells us that he was  a servant to her grace and received of her a yearly fee and other many good and greate benefits  He was likewise a favourite to several of our kings particularly  Henry  VI  Edward  IV  Richard  III and  Henry  VII and highly esteem'd by the prime of our nobility and especially by the duke of  Clarence  the king's uncle to whom he dedicated some of his works the countess of  Derby  king  Henry  VII's mother the earl of  Rivers Arundel  with many others As he was a person indefatigable and ambitious of applause as well as earnest in promoting the glory of his own country he read incessantly the  histories of his own and other nations which at proper times he digested into order At his return to  England  he became acquainted with a learned schoolmaster of  St Albans  suppos'd by some writers upon good grounds to have been the printer of  Juliana Barnes  This person having laid the foundation of a compleat body of  English  history kept a constant correspondence with Mr  Caxton  and was assisted by him in his translations but being prevented by death from finishing his work Mr  Caxtom  procur'd his papers examin'd and reduc'd them to order and compar'd them with the best authors he could get as  Livy St Austin Gildas Beda Isidorus Cassiodorus Geoffrey of Monmouth William of Malmesbury Martin Cansulanus  and others from whom he also extracted many considerable passages which he added to the history This work he entitled  Fructus temporum  or the fruits of time in seven books to which he subjoin'd a chronology The history begins with the giants the first suppos'd inhabitants of this island and concludes with the d year of  Edward  IV viz  ann  What share our author had in this performance and how great a part was done by the schoolmaster is impossible to determine This book was often reprinted and much valued at that time yet tho' it is the most considerable piece which Mr  Caxton  publish'd we have several others written and printed by himself which are as follow    An appendix to Trevisa's English translation of Randulph's polychronicon  book    The image of the world  book    The description of Great Britain  book    The life of Edward the Confessor  book    The history of king Arthur  books  and some others all in  English  The appendix to  Trevisa  is continued from the year in which the supplement of  Trevisa  to the  polychronicon  ends to the year in which he wrote it The learned Mr  Selden  indeed ascribes the whole to  Trevisa  but besides that  Caxton  takes the supplement and other additions and interpretations to himself but 'tis plain as Dr  Nicholson  observes that  Trevisa  according to that supposition must have wrote near a hundred years after his death Those which he translated out of  Latin  and  French  are as follows  Out of  Latin    Vegetius de re militari or of the art of war  books    Joannita of the game of chess  books    The history of the destruction of Troy  books    Bonaventure of the Life of Christ  book    The history of Lombardy  book    John Tinmouth's Sanctilogium Britanniae epitomiz'd by Capgrave  From  French    The siege and conquest of Jerusalem by Geodfrey of Bologne  dedicated to King  Edward  IV    The royal book entitled in French le livre royal  BESIDES these there are several others in the list of his printed works subjoin'd to the account of his life He printed likewise some books in  French  as  La legende doree  c and some in  Latin  as  Vita patruum  and  Boetius de consolatione philosophiae  c This catalogue of his works as an author I have taken from  Pitts  and  Bale  the latter of whom gives him the character of  vir non omnino stupidus nec ignavia torpens  neither a perfect dunce nor abandon'd to laziness I shall more readily assent to the judgment of a much later and more judicious writer Dr  Nicholson  who says of  Bale  p that he gives the account of men and their labours at random and of  Caxton  p that the opportunities he had of being acquainted with the courttransactions of his own time would encourage his reader to hope for greater matters from him but that his fancy seems to have lead him into an undertaking with respect to his  Fructus temporum  above his strength There is one thing very observable concerning this excellent Printer and author that he translated printed corrected illuminated and bound all his Books within his own office or printinghouse As he printed long before the method of adding the errata at the end of books was in use so his extraordinary exactness oblig'd him to a great deal more trouble than can easily be imagin'd for he tells us in the preface to some of his books that his chief care after a work was printed off was to revise it and mend all the faults with his own hand with red ink which being done to one copy he caus'd some of his journeymen to do the same throughout the whole impression which he afterwards compar'd with his first sheet to see that  they had not omitted any of his corrections 'Tis true they did not print off so large a number of books as now for or were thought a large impression but even that number made it very tedious to correct throughout tho' this was practis'd by several eminent Printers of other nations 'till they found out the way of printing the errata in some blank leaves of the book  MR  Caxton  having made himself a perfect master of the Art of Printing not at  Oxford  under  Fred Corsellis  as some authors imagine but during his travels beyond sea as will appear hereafter came and settled at  Westminster  where abbot  Islip  as some say his friend and patron assign'd him one of the chapels belonging to the abby as we have before quoted from  Newcourt  as being retir'd and free from interruption and from this or some other chapel 'tis suppos'd that the name of chapel has been given to all printinghouses in  England  ever since And notwithstanding it is by some reported that it was set up in the chapel there I can trace no footsteps of its having been practis'd in that place My manuscript beforemention'd says  'that a press was set up in  Westminster  abby by abbot  Islip  in the little ambry where  William Caxton  was master'  Mr  Bagford  assigns the house in the ambry which was formerly the king's head as the place where  Caxton  carried on his printing but had I been early enough in my enquiry before 'twas pull'd down as Mr  Bagford  was I flatter my self I could have found some remains I have great reason to think it had been a printinghouse by having been inform'd that some persons found among the rubbish some remains of printing materials but thro' ignorance of the curiosity of them they are either lost or destroy'd As I have given my reasons against the arts being practis'd in the chapel at  Westminster  I rather think that our technical terms in printing such as a printinghouse being call'd a chapel and where printing is grey in one place and too black in another the grey is call'd a fryar and the black a monk I think I say that these terms took their original from the art's being practis'd in other religious houses besides that at  Westminster  for 'tis evident by the book hereafter mention'd printed in the exempt monastery of  Tavistock  in  Devonshire  by  Dan Thomas Richard  monk of the said monastery that several of the religious orders exercis'd this art perhaps in some  outer chapel which being dedicated to some saint was only us'd once a year on the anniversary of that saint  THE reader will find that printinghouses were set up in several cities and towns in  England  where they had any considerable religious house Thus we see the abby of St  Albans  had printing there very soon as before notic'd Nor was this the only religious house where printing was practis'd and that very early for time has discover'd to us several others such as  Tavistock  as aforesaid  Worcester Canterbury Ipswich  which were chosen for that purpose We have already hinted that the first Printers were sworn servants to the Crown and in particular Mr  Caxton  not only printed as such but all his impressions were recommended either by the king or princes of the blood or by some eminent patron amongst the nobility who bore the charges of the whole The types with which he printed were peculiar to himself and easily distinguish'd from any other being a mixture of secretary and Gothic in shape the size great primer He had several eminent workmen under him particularly  Winken de Worde  a Dutchman and  Rich Pynson  a citizen of  London  who afterwards printed for themselves many valuable pieces which shall be mention'd in their proper place They likewise us'd a letter peculiar to themselves which as I shall take notice differ'd from their master's and was more refin'd and moderniz'd Mr  Caxton  besides his other valuable qualifications was a person of exemplary piety and strictness of life He continu'd printing from before the year to as is evident from the end of the  Vita patrum  and  Hilton  's  scale  printed or rather finish'd in that year by  Winken de Worde  Mr auditor  Jett  deceas'd assur'd me that he was bury'd in St  Margaret  's church  Westminster  and that he saw the remains of his tombstone but I have not as yet been able to find it  THE list of his works is as follows in which I could not possibly recover the right titles of each book but such as I could meet with I have set down exactly as printed by him Those which have no certain date are put at the end    The Game of chess  fol translated out of the Latin of  Joannita  and by him dedicated to the duke of  Florence  brother to king  Edward  IV who was murther'd in the tower  ann  There are two

book Printed by some other is what I cannot determine unless I could have seen the book  Those that follow are without date    Liber festialis  THIS edition though I have given it no higher rank upon the account of its having no date doth yet manifestly appear to me to have been the first book extant of  Caxton  's Printing I have seen it at my Lord  Pembroke  's library and compar'd it with those of the  Game of Chess  his three books of the history of  Troy  and his  Polychronicon  all which have been severally look'd upon as his oldest edition by one annalist or other and find in it these two unquestionable marks of antiquity above the other three  viz  The types on which it is printed appear to be entirely new though they be the very same which he used in all his other works whereas in the others they seem to be more used and worn This edition is the only one whose lines are not spaced out to the end this being an improvement and elegancy introduced by him in imitation of foreign Printers whereas all the first editions had the same defect with this  As for the three books of the history of  Troy  the second is that which I imagine to have been printed first I have seen it very perfect in several libraries but the first and third I never could meet with any where but in the noble library above mention'd And even here they are somewhat imperfect the first book wanting a few leaves at the beginning and the third at the end However they all bear alike the mark of antiquity and are unquestionably done with  Caxton  's types The oldest book I could ever meet with that bears a date is his second edition of the  Game at Chess  in as may be seen by the catalogue above and what inclines me to believe it to have been the first of that kind is that the same date is continued in his following works that are dated to which he sometimes added the two initial letters of his name as in the mark or rebus here subjoined  N B  W C  stands sor  William Caxton  and the Figure

was his servant and journeyman He succeeded him in his Printinghouse as appears from some of his first impressions done by him as he tells us  in the house of Mr Caxton  It's difficult to assign the exact time when he came to  England  whether with  Frederick Corsellis  as my manuscript affirms or some years after which is more probable After Mr  Caxton  's death he carry'd on the business and finish'd some volumes begun by his master as the  Canterburytales  and  Hilton's scale of perfection  This last Mr  Mattaire  dates in the year and Mr  Bagford  who gives it as the first impression done in  Winken de Worde  's name I have chosen to follow Mr  Bagford  who was very exact as far as he could procure materials for I have not yet met with the book my self Though the list of this Printer's works is very large yet I am certain there are many more either lost or still latent in some libraries for he was a person of vast industry and receiv'd all imaginable encouragement so that he publish'd several volumes in one year though we meet with some considerable chasms in others during which time we cannot suppose him idle He left  Westminster  and set up his Printinghouse in  Fleetstreet  at the sign of the  Sun  in the parish of  St Bride  I cannot determine the year of his removal though his first impression there was done  anno  He printed several  Latin  as well as  English  volumes but no  Greek  as I can find He continued Printing with great applause till the year  if not beyond that time At his death he left a sum of money for an annual  obiit  for his soul to the parish of  St Bride's  of which he was an inhabitant He was a person of great accomplishments in learning as well as strictness of morals and though he was the immediate successor of  Caxton  yet he improv'd the art to a very great perfection At his first setting up for himself his first care was to cut a new sett of puncheons which he sunk into matrices and cast several sorts of Printingletter which he afterwards us'd As  Caxton  us'd but two sizes  Double Pica  and  Great Primmer  viz  Begun and finished by me simple Man W C  Begun and finished by me simple Man W C  Winken de Worde  gave a greater scope to his fancy and form'd such a variety of sorts and sizes of letter that for several years after him none of his successors attempted to imitate him therein If he was the manual operator in cutting and casting in his own foundinghouse 'tis an incredible improvement which he made to the art but if he had his letter from any other Printer abroad though it robs him of this glory yet his excellent method of disposition composition and presswork shews him to have far excell'd his master and even to rival any of of his contemporaries abroad There is one circumstance that induces me to think that he was his own letterfounder which is that in some of his first Printed books the very letter he made use of is the same us'd by all the Printers in  London  to this day and I believe were struck from his puncheons  The first is the two lin'd  Great Primmer  black  by me Winken de Worde  The next is the  Great Primmer  black  This Work was finished by me Winken de Worde  He is the first  English  Printer who introduc'd the  Roman  letter in  England  which he us'd with his  Gothic  or black letter to distinguish any thing remarkable as we do the  Italic  with the  Roman  at this time His letter is different from most other Printers and is cast so true and stands so well in line as not to be excell'd by any ever since in his  Gothic  and  Roman  letter he fell in with the custom of those times by using abbreviations even in his small siz'd letters One circumstance I would observe is that he is the only Printer I can find in  England  that us'd very small body'd letters in the infancy of the art and he was fond even to the very last of using his master  Caxton  's rebus of which we have given a specimen at the bottom of page Upon the whole he was a very curious laborious and indefatigable Printer and I doubt not but time will add to his character by bringing to light some noble testimonies of so great a man which for want of I am obliged to say so little here He is the first Printer I have yet discover'd who began to print the yearbooks  He and his Successor  Richard Pinson Lincoln'sInn  Manuscriptlibrary being inprinted above yearbooks

The governal of health    The eleven grammars by Winken de Worde  THIS curious piece is in the Lord  Pembroke  's library and has some observations written on a blank page at the beginning which are to this effect  'The eleven grammars printed by  Winken de Worde  who was the d Printer in  Westminster  he lived afterwards within the walls of  London  at the sign of the  Sun  in  Fleetstreet Richard Pinson  afterwards his worthy successor and he printed above yearbooks which are in  Lincoln's Inn  Manuscript library they being inscribed  Libri Manuscripti  He was soninlaw to  Caxton  who first printed at  Westminster  in the Almonry beyond  WestminsterSchool  These eleven grammars were all printed above years before  Lily  's grammar and appear to be the foundation of his'  WE shall have occasion to give a further account of these yearbooks when we come to speak of  R Pinson  who continued printing them a considerable time after  Winken de Worde  's death As for the eleven grammars they are in one volume in the form of a very small quarto and neatly printed and it is judiciously observed that they were printed above a century before that famous one of  Lylly  which has been thought and is still by those who never heard of this edition to be the first grammar that ever was printed in  England  FROM this large catalogue of  Winken de Worde  's works it is plain that he must have been an indefatigable Printer and that the chasms that frequently happen in some years must be owing to the books being either lost or as yet undiscover'd but more probably the former and whoever considers that the greatest part of them were either schoolbooks classics prayerbooks  c  besides a vast number of popish ones which might daily perish soon after the Reformation and of how short duration the former are in the hands of schoolboys and devotees such as that age abounded with will rather wonder that so great a number of them have escaped the common fate of such performances So that we may justly conclude that the preservation of these books is more owing to the character and excellency of the Printer than of the authors and to the neatness and correctness of the work rather than the goodness or usefulness of the subject After he was removed from  Westminster  to  London  we do not hear of any other Printers at the former if there were any they were such whose works and memory in all probability died with or soon after them  The City of LONDON MCCCCLXXXI  THO'  Richard Pinson  be the first known Printer that set up his Press in this famous city and all former annalists have ranked it in their list from his first edition yet father  Orlandi  has since discover'd to us a much more antient one which was printed in  London anno  that is years before the former which makes me hope that time may still discover more if not of older date yet at least to fill up the chasm between this and the first of  Pinson  For it is scarce to be supposed that  Westminster  should begin so soon to encourage the art as we have seen in the last article and that  London  should wholly neglect it However be that how it will it is certain that if it was but slow in receiving it it made ample amends for it afterwards and that  Pinson  and  De Worde  when he removed thither gave a new life to it so that in a little time there were several considerable Printinghouses set up in the most convenient parts of this large metropolis  wherein it has flourished and improved ever since Some of those eminent Printers received likewise great encouragement from the Crown particularly by patents for printing of Bibles and other works of which I shall give an account under the names of the Printers to whom they were granted  N B  As  Caxton  printed all his works in the old letter and  W de Worde  in a mix'd character of Roman and Black we have distinguish'd their works in the two former catalogues from those that follow by printing them in Italic but as the Roman types became by this time more common we shall give the list of the following Printers works in that character  THIS antient and curious edition above mention'd is as follows  Valdesius super Psalterium Londini    I RICHARD PINSON Anno MCCCCXCIII  RICHARD PINSON  alias  PYNSON is the first known Printer in the city of  London  no edition having been hitherto discover'd except that anonymous one mention'd above of older date than his dialogue of  Dives  and  Pauper  in Besides as we have about editions of his that are without date we may more reasonably suppose that they were printed before than after this year in which he began to put a date He was brought up under Mr  Caxton  as well as  Winken de Worde  and being become a thorough master of the art went and set up a Press of his own at  Templebar  as the inscription of his first edition shews The friendship which he had contracted with  De Worde  whilst these two wrought under  Caxton  was so far from being disturb'd by any mutual emulation or rivalship that it continued to their death and it is thought that after their master's death  Pynson  prevail'd upon him to leave  Westminster  and to come and settle nearer to him which he accordingly did What makes this more than probable is that the last edition of  Caxton  is dated as we have shewn  anno  and the first that  De Worde  printed in  London  as far as we have been able to discover is dated These two were joined in  the Printing of the king's yearbooks as long as  De Worde  lived which were afterwards continued by  Pinson  and this is a sufficient testimony of his having been an excellent Printer were there nothing else to assure us of it for it is not to be suppos'd that he would have associated himself to any other  Pynson  stiles himself Printer to the king in some of his editions probably from a grant he had for the printing of those yearbooks above mention'd For we neither find that he printed any bibles or other books for which patents were granted by the crown I don't find that he used any rebus but he either printed his name at length or else only the two initial letters R P The list of his works is nothing so copious as those of his associate tho' he continued Printing at least years as appears from the dates of his first and last edition which makes me conclude that a great part of them are lost Those I have been able to recover are as follow  Dialogue of  Dives  and  Pauper  upon the X Commandements emprinted by  Richard Pynson  at  Templebar  of  London  V day of  July    Sulpitii Verulami opus

considerable number of Year or LawBooks that pass'd under several Kings Reigns as was hinted before some with  Winken de Worde  and others after his death some with the dates of the Year and Month in which they were printed and his name at the end and some without either However it must be observed that a great part of the oldest of them have the name  Guilelmus Rastell  written at the head by which we conjecture that they only printed them for him For  Rastel  was Printer to the King and a very considerable person at that time and in great credit at Court upon the account of his having marry'd Sir  Thomas More  's Sister So that it is very likely he had the Privilege of printing all these Royal Books and gave them a sanction by prefixing his name to them whilst the others only acted under him What seems to confirm it is that those earlier ones with  Pynson  's name mention only  Ex Officinâ Pynsonianâ  whereas in those of later date he calls himself Printer to his Majesty in which Office he probably succeeded  Rastell  who died according to Dr  Nicholson an  Thus at the end of the d Edition of that of the of  Edward  IV We find this Colophon  Explicit annus dus  Ed iiij

Author and Historian became a famous and eminent Printer Among other of his works under the former character we have his Abridgement of the Chronicle of  England  in which he is a constant borrower from the bulkier work of  Edward Hall  Recorder of  London  who wrote the History of the Wars between the Houses of  York  and  Lancaster  wherein the Reader will find little worth notice if we may believe Dr  Nicholson  than the fashions and changes of Dress in each King's Reign As  Grafton  was not over judicious in the choice of this Author so neither was he in the compiling of his Abridgement in so much that the learned  Buchanan  in his History of  Scotland  doth not scruple to call him  a very headless and unskilful Writer  tho' he has had the honour of being quoted by  Stow  and other Historians  THE occasion of his turning Printer was his being pitch'd upon to procure an Edition of  William Tyndal  alias  Hickins  Version of the New Testament and afterwards of his Bible revised and corrected by  Myles Coverdal  a learned  Franciscan  Fryar well learned in the  Hebrew Greek  and  Latin  tongues Some impressions of the former had already been dispersed about  England  and elsewhere but were bought up by  Tonstal  Bishop of  London  and Sir  Thomas More  and been burnt at St  Paul's Cross  and it was very dangerous to undertake the reprinting of such a work in  London  upon that account This made  Grafton  and his associate  Edward Whitchurch  resolve to get it done at  Hamburgh  whither they likewise sent  Coverdal  to correct the Press This proved a very expensive work and the impression of the Bible alone cost them  l  a great sum in those days When it was brought over into  England  it met with great opposition from the  Romish  Priests they having some time before obtain'd a Royal Proclamation to prohibit and abolish that among other heretical books and had not  Bonner  Bishop of  Hereford  bought up the greatest part of the Copies in order to destroy them the undertakers must have been infallibly ruin'd This Edition is suppos'd to have been printed  anno    HIS New Testament met with worse fate of which we have an authentick testimony extant in the Library of the Honourable Earl of  Pembroke viz  two Editions of it printed at  Antwerp  in the same year  viz anno  one of which has a Preface prefix'd to it to justify that Edition from the other of the same year printed under his name but strangely mutilated and misprinted A more particular account of which is given in the Introduction to  Wickliff  's Bible lately publish'd  FINDING that a version of the Bible was as much desir'd by the favourers of the Reformation as it was cry'd down by the enemies of it they ventur'd to print a second edition of it under the patronage of Archbishop  Cranmer  and the Lord  Cromwell  But  Tyndal  having been by that time burnt as a heretick in  Flanders  and his name growing then somewhat ignominious they thought fit to publish it under the name of  Matthews  's Bible tho'  Tyndal  is affirm'd to have finish'd all but the  Apocrypha  as some or as far as  Nehemiah  as others affirm  Grafton  having finish'd the printing of it presented it to his two great Patrons by whom at his request it was likewise presented to the King to whom it was dedicated It had these words in red letters printed at the bottom of the titlepage  set forth with the King's most gracious licence  But as they were suspected to have been foisted in  Grafton  obtain'd leave to have it further licensed under the privy seal Soon after this it being observed how acceptable an  English  Bible was to the people some persons form'd a design to print it in a smaller volume in order to undersell  Grafton  's which obliged him to apply to  Cromwell  and to obtain a patent from the King that none should print it for three years and for the better sale of this that noble man did likewise procure him an order that every Curate of a parish should be obliged to have one and every Abby six of them so that this second impression wherever printed was very soon bought up  GRAFTON and his partners in the work observing that there was still a call for them resolved to reprint it a third time and in a larger volume but without these notes and prologues which they observ'd had given some offence  Paris  was the place pitch'd upon to print it at and  Cromwell  who favour'd the enterprize procured letters from King  Henry  to the  French  King  to permit a subject of his to print the  English  Bible in the university of  Paris  because of the goodness of the  French  paper and workmen Bonner  then Ambassador from  England  to the Court had likewise orders  to assist the undertakers of that good work in all reasonable suits Bonner  obtain'd not only the desir'd licence but likewise letters patents for printing this Bible and for conveying it safe over to  England  This edition being thus encourag'd went briskly on to the end but  Bonner  who never liked the work and did only promote it to make his court to  Cromwell  found means to obstruct it privately notwithstanding the King's patents  ACCORDINGLY  anno  the Printers were taken up and charged with heresy by order of the Faculty and  Coverdale  the corrector  Grafton  the Head Printer and other  Englishmen  who contributed to the charges of the impression were sent for but they foreseeing the consequences fled away as fast as they could and left the whole impression which was just finish'd and consisted of Copies behind them This was immediately seiz'd by the Lieutenant Criminal and order'd to be burnt except some few which he sold through covetousness for wastepaper which were afterwards bought up again being about four fats or chests full  MY Lord  Pembroke  favour'd me with the sight of an  English  Bible printed in  Gothic  characters  an  without place or Printer's name with these words at the end  The end of the New Testament and of the whole Byble  ¶ To the Honoure and Prayse of Gode was this Byble prynted and fyneshed in the yere of oure Lorde Gode a M D XXXVII  BUT whether this is one of them that were printed at  Paris  or one of the former edition I cannot determine but it is more probable to be the latter because it has a Concordance of the most remarkable texts of Scripture against the errors of Popery whereas as I observ'd before they had suppress'd most things of that nature in the  Paris  one But let this be of what edition it will it is very probable that the Concordance proved the cause of the almost total destruction of it in so much that I question whether there be any other copy of it left except this above mention'd However  Grafton  and his associates by  Cromwell  's  encouragement went soon after to  Paris  and got the presses letters and workmen and brought them over to  London  and so set up for Printers themselves which they never intended before and began to reprint the same Bible which they finish'd in an account of which you'll find in the following list of  Grafton  's works  WE find a patent in  Rymer's faedera  vol p from King  Henry  VIII appointing him and his partner  Whitchurch  to print the Book of divine service but as I have not been able to meet with the Book I have not inserted it in the list The patent is dated  Jan    Grafton  styled himself  Typographus Regius  His mark or sign was an Appletree springing up out of a Tun or Ton as they spell'd it then alluding to his name  Graftton  with this motto  suscipite insitum verbum  Jacob He had likewise a Cypher over the Tun with the two initials of his name one in another thus  Richard Grafton's printer's mark  His works are as follows  The New Testament in  English  and  Latin  vo  London  printed by  Rich Grafton  and  Ed

list of all the curious editions of the most ancient Printers such as printed only from Manuscripts as I have seen in my Lord  Pembroke  's library  c  but am glad to find that Mr  Maittaire  has been beforehand with me in favouring the world with it in his  Annales Typographici  IN the conclusion of the second book of this History pag I ventur'd to affirm after  Orlandi  and other Annalists that the invention of ingraving began much about the same time with that of Printing but I have been since convinced that the former began much earlier from a curious collection which my Lord  Pembroke  was pleased to show me in which the whole progress of that invention is set down in writing under each print Having therefore obtain'd his Lordship's leave to copy it from his own book and to give it a place in this work I think I cannot better conclude this History than by obliging the curious with this valuable collection  AN APPENDIX To the GENERAL HISTORY of PRINTING of BOOKS BEING AN ADDITIONAL HISTORY OF THE RISE and PROGRESS of  PRINTS  Which are Incus'd  Exactly copy'd from the R H the Earl of  Pembroke  's curious Book of those PRINTS in which each Piece hath its own particular account of its manner  c  in Manuscript in a right progressive order as follows  ANTONIO POLLAIOLOLO nat ob  Baldinucci  says that he engraved the Battle at  Florence  about and that  Andrea Montegna  graved his Triumph at  Rome  soon after his being there They both graved upon Pewter The former printed his name on it thus  Opus Antonij Pollaiololo Florentini    Israel van Meckenem  his own Effigies  This  Israel van Meckenem  is by some authors called  Van Mecklin    Mentz    Moguntin Lomazero  says he was the first that engraved he was Master to  Bon Martino  who was Master to  Albert Durer  whose first Print was a Copy after this of  Israel  's  an  and as  Baldinucci  says  Israel  did not engrave till he had seen the Triumph of  Ant Montegno anno  which is the oldest date that any author has mention'd and the termination being  Spanish  shows that the art spread very soon    A M  was as is supposed  Andrea de Murano  This Print is upon that mixt metal on which Goldsmiths used to engrave their first proofs It is now likewise used by other artists Founders call it the hard metal and Printers the Typemetal tho' the latter has a greater proportion of Iron The other materials are Lead Blocktin and Regulus of Antimony  Albert Durer  began by copying of old Prints as you will see when you come to him this Print is older than that of which stands by it which was taken to be the oldest of any one with a date by the author who mentions this for want of knowing of that As for the year above mention'd it agrees with the time in which  A de Murano  flourish'd and  Baldinucci  speaks in one place as if other authors were uncertain how near the invention of Prints was Yet he seems to say that  Maso Finiguerri  was not long before  Pollaiololo  who follow'd  Baccio Baldini  who imitated  Maso  the inventor of Prints by taking off some from engraved silver work to see the impression but unless he did so some years before this Print must be older    Andrea Montegna  N  an  The next after  Pollaiololo  who engraved in  Italy  His best works were after the Antique But this first is none of the nine which he composed from the Antiques  The sixth in order of his painting This is his original Print they have since finished within these outlines the Prints that are commonly sold for it  This was printed when they used the smoke of a candle instead of  mpblack ink    Mich Angelo  on silk This is only from a drawing the painting of which has much more in it and is to be seen in my Lord's Gallery This is the first Print that is not upon Paper  The  Suavius  was the first Print done on two Copperplates This Print besides the blue ground has the figure of old  Time  clipping  Cupid  's wings After this  Perrier  did engrave this and then the five more on three Copperplates as  Carpi  did upon wood  The Head of  Lutma  the Father done with the hammer the black and white disposed contrary to Mezotinto  Per Janum Lutma  In this  John Lutma  has added graving to the hammering    Jacobus Lutma  mixed etching with engraving    Venus  and  Mavors Mars  by  Joannes Collaert  This is the only Print that ever was graved on Steel    Dominico Campagnola  the first that printed with red on a black ground  This manner which was invented in  Germany  differs from all Prints because the ink rises upon the paper  This done by  J S  as in the shield came from  Venice  the lines are not engraved but made by Points  Four Mezotinto's varying from the common manner of those Prints In this the figure our Saviour on the Cross is engraved the rest is done in Mezotinto the other three are each in a different colour  Mr  Tayler  a Painter who improved the printing of Stuffs in  Holland  he invented this Art of printing in colours and Mr  Le Blond  though he might take the hint from this has further improved it by printing his pieces so as to look like painting the first that he did in this kind was after the  Baroccio  in my Lord  Pembroke  's gallery  The first Print of  Martin Sch  n al Chon  as the  French  write and pronounce it and called  Bon Martino  by the  Italians Bon  being a kind of a translation of  Sch  n  which in the  HighGerman  signifies  sine  beautiful Martin  was Master to  Albert Durer  but learned his Art at first by copying after the Print next to it of  Israel van Meckenem    Israel van Meckenem  This is the only one of his that has the place's name  viz Tzù  at  Boackholt  The first Print of  Albert Durer  which is a Copy after  Israel  's He engraved this also upon Pewter  Albert Durer nat    ob  was famous for cutting on Wood and all other manners of ingraving as may be seen by these four that follow  viz  st Engraved on Pewter which was his first manner  d Cut on Wood and on three planches  d Engraved on Copper in which he was the first and the best and was imitated by  Mark Antonio  th Etched being the first of that kind    Maso Finiguerra  a Goldsmith at  Florence  the inventer of Prints tho' he made no Print till after  A Pollaiololo Albert Durer  copy'd this so as to stand the same way as the Original They stand each by the other in the book    Albert Durer  made this piece in imitation of the oldest Print which was graved  anno    This bears the oldest date of all his whether on Wood or Copper This is also dated but the mark differs from his usual mark  If  Hugo Carpi  was the inventor of Printing upon three planches he must have been very young for he was but years old when  A Durer  did this in which is the Head of  Ulricus Var  buler  very large from three planches with his own name to it  Albert Durer  The first Print etch'd upon Iron by  A Durer  Another of his of  anno  in which he perfected the Art of etching on Iron even before  Parmigiano  tho' this last in  Italy  is affirmed to have been the first Etcher    Albert Durer  before his he used a mark the manner of this  that of his Master  The first Print on Copper by  A Durer  with his mark before he began to date this is his first manner  This is without crossstrokes  Melaine  's manner is a fine improvement of this  This piece is dated and bears the oldest date either on Copper or Wood  One of This  Adam  and  Eve  were the chief of his last manner vastly neat and imitated by  Marc Antonio  in  Germany  This is reckoned more scarce than his St  Jerom  The St  Jerom  This the  Bolonia  edition of  Vasari  calls  La Maraviglia  or the prodigy of Art  The last piece that  Durer  engrav'd It is the head of  Erasmus  and is dated  A Crucifix engraved on a golden head of the Emperor's Cane It was sold for Gilders and is the only Print taken from Gold that of  An Caracci  is only from a silver salver My Lord has it there is but this one Print of it which he took off as a proof before it was gilt  The famous Bagpiper by  Lucas van Leyden  This is the Original which was sold for Duccatoons The Copy which stands next to it is pretty scarce These two and that on the gold cane were on one Cartoon in the  Arundel  Collection  N B Incused  is the proper term to signify those plates which bear the ink between the lines of the graving as  excused  is of those that have it on the face of the line Thus the prints in the  Paginae Conglutinatae  were  excused  but those of  Albert Durer incused  he being the first inventor of this manner as being cheaper and easier cut than upon copper  The following is a List of XVI Volumes of DRAWINGS and PRINTS in the same Library relating to the same subject as the former and copy'd from the ManuscriptTitles of the Books themselves  THESE DRAWINGS and PRINTS consist but of a very few in comparison of many numerous collections for here are chiefly  Italian  designs and only one of each master to see the variety of manners except of the most noted  Italian  masters a pretty many and all of such  Italian  Painters as also themselves graved etched or cut in Wood of original Drawings here are but two volumes of  Italian  Painters except a few who were also esteem'd in  Italy  in a chronological order The st Vol has Painters one of each the d Vol has of the chief Painters of each five but of  Rasael Urbin  and  Correggio  of each As to Prints  Marolles  had more than times as many In his st book he says he had above and in his d he added about more The King of  France  has since bought them But he gathered all and of all sorts that he could find well or ill preserv'd as for intire books graved there are very many but here are only those of  Italian  Painters antiquities excepted as for loose Prints only volumes as follows  IN the first volumes of Prints are above each by a different master ending with  Edelinck Andran  and their disciples engraving and etching being brought to perfection by them  Vol III but the first of PRINTS  Part I  The Introduction comprehends the first inventors of all the different manners many of them now disus'd or the Art lost  Part II  Gravers all of  Italian  Pictures  Vol IV  Part  Etchers all of  Italian  Pictures  Cut on Wood all of  Italian  Pictures  Mezotinto all of  Italian  Pictures  Vol V  Gravers by Pictures of other nations not  Italian  Vol VI  Part  Etchers by Pictures of other nations not  Italian  Part  Cut in Wood by Pictures of other nations not  Italian  Part  Mezotinto by Pictures of other nations not  Italian  Vol VII  The chief Gravers their principal Prints all after  Italian  Paintings of  Rafael Urbin  and all that they graved  Vol VIII  Etchers who were also Painters and at the end are all that  Ang Caracci  graved the other two  Caracci  's being in this book  Vol IX  More noted Etchers who were also Painters most of these are famous for Landskips and some also for little figures  Vol X  The chief Artists who cut in Wood and only after great  Italian  Painters all that they did both single and as intire books  Vol XI  All these are after  Rafael Urbin  by many Gravers and Etchers different from those beforemention'd at the end of which are many Drawings by  Santo Bartholi  after such of  Rafael  's Pictures as were never graved he intending had he liv'd to have graved them they were sold by his Widow Of  Raphael  and the following three here are collections of single Prints also the other great Painters have been graved chiefly in entire books  Vol XII  All these are after  Correggio  both single Prints and as entire books  Vol XIII  All these are after  Guido Rheni  of single Prints  Vol XIV  All these are after  Barocci  but the d part is of the  Arundel  collection only of the  Italian  historical Pictures or Drawings  Vol XV in two parts  The heads of  Vandyke  both those which he etched himself and that were done by others of which here are above Part I hath of them of which are etched by  Vandyke  the rest of the are of M  Vander Enden  Vol XVI  Single Prints of Antiquities and chiefly those by  Lafreri  being by the largest scale as well as before they were mended and some are also as mended by which one may compare what parts were truly antique I have also the book of  Lafreri  with the Titlepage but tho' scarce and of an old date yet after these some body got an imperfect collection of some of his Plates and mix'd them with others of less value  These Volumes of DRAWINGS and PRINTS my Lord tells me were collected by his Father except some few agreeable to his design which were afterwards added by my Lord himself especially such as related to the origine of Prints  AN ALPHABETICAL and CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE Of all the CITIES and PLACES in which the  ART of PRINTING

Lord's that what was in Red was Printed made me Print what I have say'd of it but my Lord not approving of it I promised to Print at the end of the Errata what his Lordship had writ at the beginning of his Book as follows  I bought this Book because it is Printed before they made use of Matrices to cast single Letters From the variation of the Shapes of the same Letters it appears to be Wooden Movable Types As for the Red I told the man that I believ'd there was some Cheat in it because I had some Months before such a Book printed without the Red brought to me by an other Person who ask'd me more for it then I car'd to give The Paper has the Bull's Head on which  Faust  c printed and is reckon'd to be older than any dated by  Faust  and so older than the Date here in Red
