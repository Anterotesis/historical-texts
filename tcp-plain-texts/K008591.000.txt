 TO Mr GRAY ON HIS ODES  I  REPINE not GRAY that our weak dazzled Eyes  Thy daring heights and brightness shun  How few can track the Eagle to the skies  Or like Him gaze upon the Sun  II  The gentle Reader loves the gentle Muse  That little dares and little means  Who humbly sips her Learning from  Reviews    Or flutters in the  Magazines  III  No longer now from Learning's sacred Store  Our Minds their health and vigor draw  HOMER and PINDAR are rever'd no more  No more the  Stagyrite is Law  IV  Tho' nurst by these in vain thy Muse appears  To breath her ardors in our Souls  In vain to sightless Eyes and deaden'd Ears  The Light'ning gleams and Thunder rolls  V  Yet droop not GRAY nor quit thy Heav'nborn Art  Again thy wond'rous Powers reveal  Wake slumb'ring Virtue in the  Briton  's Heart  And rouse Us to  reflect  and  feel  VI  With antient Deeds our longchill'd Bosoms fire  Those Deeds which mark ELIZA's reign  Make  Britons    Greeks  againThen strike the Lyre  And PINDAR shall not Sing in vain
