 A SERMON PREACHED IN THE PARISH CHURCH OF BOLDRE IN HAMPSHIRE AT THE FUNERAL OF WILLIAM BAKER MAY TO WHICH IS ADDED A SHORT ACCOUNT OF HIS LIFE  By WILLIAM GILPIN MINISTER OF THE PARISH  LONDON PRINTED FOR R BLAMIRE IN THE STRAND  MDCCXCI  Well done good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord  MATT XXV  IT is the happiness of our religion that all mankind poor and rich are equally able to please God The lowest may be as ac∣ceptable in his Maker's sight as the highest nor are any man's services so mean as to be overlooked by his great Master Before christianity indeed men were too apt to think that such only as had the powerful means of doing good could obtain the favour of Godand that low people could do little to please him But the gospel informs us that God does not regard  the action  without  the heart  from which the action proceeds and that the  willing mind  tho unaccompanied by the action is as pleasing in God's sight  as the  action itself  So that you see the rich and poor are all equally in God's favour Let each of us only do his duty in his pro∣per station  as to the Lord and not unto man  that is with a desire to please God who has placed us in our several stations and the lowest of us shall be among those to whom the text is applied  Well done good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord  But now my brethren among the duties of our several stations there are some which equally belong both to rich and poor and there are some which belong to one station rather than the otherLet me explain my meaning to you  Among the duties which belong to both may be reckoned those duties which we owe to Godlove trust reverence prayer Such also are the duties of reading and me∣ditating on scriptureof observing the sab∣bathof faith in our Redeemerof attend∣ing the Lord's supper Such also are humility honestya desire to serve our neighbour as far as we canthe care of our families and other duties that might be mention∣ed All these are equally required from the poor and rich because the poor may perform them as well as the rich  But there are other duties which are  not thus equally  required As the rich man abounds in the things of this world it is required of him to be  generous and charitable  because God hath enabled him to be so But as the poor man cannot be generous and charitable like the rich man it is rather required of him to be  industrious  and  frugal  On the present occasion therefore I shall make the duties of  industry  and  frugality  the subject of my discourse I mention them together because they must always keep company to be of any use  Frugality  can do little without  industry  and  industry  as little without  frugality  I shall give you the chief reasons which should incline you to the practice of these duties  In the first place I would have you con∣sider what the scripture says on this subject It is often touched upon but one of the most remarkable passages is that of St Paul to the Thessalonians  When we were with you this we commanded you that if any would not work neither should he eat for we hear there are some among you which walk dis∣orderly working not at all Now such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ that with quietness they work and eat their own bread  Now this command that we should all  eat our own bread  is plainly found∣ed on this reason that nobody has a right  to eat the bread of others if he be able to procure his ownIn some cases no doubt the parishallowance is a necessary reliefas when the father of a family is taken off while his children are yet young or when a family perhaps is greatly visited by sicknessor when a family is uncom∣monly large But how many are there who shamefully run to the parish for relief without any necessity of this kind These are people who either want  industry  in pro∣viding for their familiesor  frugality  in not making the best use of what they pro∣vide They frequent the alehouse or they spend what they have in good eating or in other things which are not necessary Let them consider how directly they break a scripturecommand by  eating other mens bread for nought  and by  becoming chargeable  without necessity  It may be hoped that with christians a scripturecommand may have sufficient weight However I shall endeavour to shew you more at large on what  reasons  this  scripturecom∣mand  is founded  In the first place how desirable is it to see your little habitations as clean neat and well furnished as any of your neigh∣boursto see your children decently cloathed to give them what little education you canto have them taught to read which may be a comfort to them during their lives  to have them taught to spin and work which may give them early habits of dili∣gence But all this cannot be done without great industry and frugality in the parent You have a choice therefore before you whether it is better to do all thisat least to do it in the best manner you canor to idle away your time or spend your mo∣ney in drinking at alehouses How often are the children of idle parents sent to poorhouses where their fathers sins are visited upon them in all the wretchedness misery and neglect which the poor little sufferers are too often obliged to undergoMuch have those parents to answer forI have myself heard some of these idle parents al∣ledge that as they made their money them∣selves they had a right to spend it as they pleasedTo tell such people that no man has a farther right to any thing which God has given him than to make a proper use of it would be to little pur∣pose yet surely they must see the force of this that if they marry and have families their families should be considered as a part of themselves and have surely a right not only to their maintenance but to the best instruction and care their parents can be∣stow Who is the proper person to take care of the children but the parent  I would have you consider farther that  industry  and  frugality  are virtues which  have a particular tendency to keep you out of the way of temptation and mischief Where think you is lewdness and drunk∣enness and prophaneness and sabbathbreak∣ing and cursing and swearing and all other wickedness best taught It's best school I believe is the alehouse The devil tempts you to be idle first and to love drink then all wickedness follows naturally He cannot so easily get hold of a frugal industrious man The indus∣trious man is otherwise employed When the day's labour is over he wishes for the night's rest Between both he has hardly time to be wicked I believe if you will look round your acquaintances you will find the most industrious and the most frugal people to be also the best  Consider farther that  industry and fru∣gality  raise your  characters  in the parish and give you consequence You are often inclined to think yourselves of more con∣sequence than you really are You are often ready to take offence when you hear any little story told of you which you think you do not deserve tho probably the story may be very true All this however shews you wish to preserve your characters But you take the wrong way It is not believ∣ing yourselves of consequence or desiring to stop peoples mouths that will give you credit with your neighbours Leave your  neighbours to talk as  they will  and do you act as  you ought  and you need take no farther care about your characters Honesty industry and frugality will give character and consequence to the lowest among you He who supports himself by his own labour is equal to any body The richest man in the country is not more independent While his idle neighbour abject and baseminded is pitifully going about begging relief of a parishofficer  he  feels his own consequence and is beholden only to his heavenly Master he wants no assistance but God's blessing and the use of his limbs  Lastly I should wish you to consider that  industry and frugality  are the best means of making you  happy  I might say this with re∣gard to the next world for all virtues are gene∣rally more or less linked together but I am speaking now only of the happiness of this life With what pleasure may a poor man look round him and see all his family out in the world and by the blessing of God doing well through his precepts and example and himself with some little matter still before him if God should lengthen out his time a little longer There are many cases no doubt where it is impossible that any thing can be saved but in many families even in this parish I know something might If people would only save what they spend at alehouses or in things unnecessary some∣thing  might be laid by against a fit of sick∣ness or if God should bless them with health against old ageAnd is the pleasure think you of sotting at an alehouse equal to this comfortable independence I know there are many who reason with themselves that if they can maintain their families while they are well it is all they desire when they are sick or old the parish is obliged to maintain them It may be a person's misfortune to come to the parish but when a man in the prime of his strength  reasons in this way  I dare take upon me to say he is at the bot∣tom an idle goodfornothing fellow and his reasoning is only an excuse for drinking or some other extravagance In general such people go on in a regular progress to ruin At first they get a love for liquor They will sit whole days and nights in alehouses They next get into debt If they have farms to manage their affairs go wrong If they are labourers their families want bread their children are halfstarved and halfnaked I need not point out these people to you they point out themselves You see them loitering about the parish languid infeebled wretches with faces sodden pale and dropsical the objects equally of pity and contempt Many no doubt frequent sotting houses who have not yet gone this length but they are in the high way towards it let them take care in time  their  ruin is coming on  There is no real happiness my neighbours you may depend upon it in such a life as this However you may be inticed by the pleasures of idleness profligacy and drinking which last is commonly the beginning of all mischief you may be assured that all these things bring their bitter moments not only  at last  but  continually  and that nothing can make a man so happy as living in his station as he ought with honesty sobriety industry and frugality No man can live happily who lives at the will and under the controul of others These virtues allow a man to live independent of others and in the manner he wishes to live himself  Such was the life of our very respectable neighbour whose remains lie before us His station in life you know was only that of a common daylabourer but as far as I could judge he set just such an example in that station and behaved exactly as he ought to have done He had that generous independent spirit which I have been recom∣mending to you that scorned to live upon the labours of others and seemed to lay it down as a principle from the beginning of his life to be obliged under God only to his own labour By this alone he bred up a large family without receiving a single farthing from the parish But this could not have been done without great industry and frugality He worked hard he lived hard  denying himself every indulgence in eating and drinking that he might not be a burden to othersWhen his family was off his hands he thought for the same reason it was proper for him to lay up a little for his old age While he  could  therefore he con∣tinued still to work and lived in the same hard manner which was now become quite easy and habitual to himIt pleased God to bless his labour he laid up so much as maintained him during his old age and he has left something behind him to be a comfort to his children if they make a right use of it He never could be said to be wholly past his labour Till within a few weeks of his death he every day worked a little and it became an agreeable amusement to him He had all his life been used to laborious working Many a time I have heard him say that in general labourers now did not know what it was to work and I have heard others say who knew him better than I did that he would have done as much in one day as many people do in two  I have heard some of his neighbours tax him with being a miser and covetous and say that as he might have lived more com∣fortably in his old age his hard living could be owing only to a covetous temper He might it is true have lived more comfor∣tably in his old age as  they  may think who accuse himand who are fonder of indulgence  than he was but he could not have lived more comfortably to himself than he did and I am persuaded no man had ever less of the miser in his heart But let me defend the character of my good old neighbour in this particular let me shew you the dif∣ference between his temper and that of a miser  A miser hoards money for  it's own sake  He does not consider the use it is to answer nor indeed puts it to any use at all Hoarding it up is all he has in view He  loves money  You remember an instance of a person not many years ago in this parish who expired grasping his purse under his bedcloaths to his heart Perhaps he meant to secure it if he should recover but it plainly appeared to be his first care and if any one should charge him with a love of money I should not know how to defend him  With covetousness or a love of money there is often mixedindeed I believe generally a little knavery If he who  loves money  do not openly cheat he has many ways of prac∣tising little underhand dirty tricks which an upright man would hardly call honest I give you the best side of him for the miser is generally a very wicked character The apostle indeed tells us that the  love of money is the root of all evil  Had our worthy deceased neighbour these signs of a miser about him As to his inte∣grity  I dare take upon me to say a more upright honest man never lived Many dis∣honest practices I have heard of in the parish many little knavish tricks I have seen to take advantages and get money but I never heard of one action in the whole long life of our deceased neighbour that was not fair and honest and upright in the highest degree and I doubt not but you can all join with me in bearing this testimony So far then you will allow that nothing of the temper of a miser yet appears How should there There was no foundation for it He had no love for money merely for it's own sake but as it might be the means of carrying him independently to the end of his lifeand if he did not spend it all that the remainder might be of some little use to his family I have known him do what in his circumstan∣ces were even generous things Where he thought it necessary to spend his money he spent it freely He lived hard indeed but whom did that hurt It enabled him to do many a kind thing but nobody ever suffered from it but himself It is not  living hard  it is not  laying up money  that makes a man a miser but it is the intention with which he lives hardit is the intention with which he lays up money Our late neighbour's intention was merely that of an independent spirit which could not bear to be supported by other people's labour He lived hard  himself lest if he had indulged himself he should afterwards have been obliged to live on the labours of othersAnd is there any thing in this like a love for money He had no love for money that interfered I dare take upon me to say with any one duty that belonged to his station How little he valued it for it's own sake I had many op∣portunities of seeing as most of his money passed through my hands Some years ago you remember his house was broken open he mentioned his loss to me not like a miser but as far as his money was concerned with christian indifference His chief distress was for those who had done the deed To him he said they had done little injury By the blessing of God he doubted not but he had enough to support him while he lived and it was owing I believe more to his lenity and scruples than to the want of evidence that the thieves were not convicted So far from having any thing covetous about him he appeared always to me entirely disengaged from all worldly thoughts strongly impressed with a sense of religion and ready to leave all behind him with the utmost indifference and begin his great journey to eternity at a moment's warning whenever it should please God to call him He used to talk of death just as he would of one of the commonest events of life and left with me a few direc∣tions about carrying his body to the grave  with as much indifference as a farmer would give directions about carrying a load of corn to his barn  Thus through a very long life he passed innocently religiously inoffensively and quietly to that grave to which we now con∣sign him Let me earnestly exhort all you who this day follow his corps thither to follow also his examplethat when it becomes your turn to be brought dead into the church your neighbours may point out your example as they may his for others to follow and apply to you as I hope we may with justice apply to him  Well done good and faithful servant thou hast been faith∣ful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy Lord  WILLIAM Baker was born in the year in the parish of Boldre near Lymington in Hampshire His father dying when he was two years old left him and a sister to the care of his widow who by taking in washing maintained her two children without any relief from the parish In these days such industry would exceed belief  At seven years of age young Baker began that life of labour which he continued with unremitting perseverance through the space of seventy years afterwards He worked first for a penny a day in the vicaragegarden but soon thought himself equal to more pro∣fitable labour He used to say he always considered himself as a poor friendless lad and from the beginning depended only on himself  In the mean time his mother grew old and infirm Her legs swelled and she could no longer stand at her washtub But no∣thing hurt her like the thoughts of going to the poorhouse or living on alms  Her son was now about eighteen He was healthy and strong and assured his mother that while he was able to work for her she should be obliged to nobody He took a little cottage therefore on the edge of  the forest carried her to it and got into the service of a farmer in the neighbourhood as a daylabourer His mother lived nine years after this during which time he main∣tained her with great chearfulness and kindness nor had she ever assistance from any other person He denied himself every little indulgence which young fellows of that age often take that he might maintain his motherWe do not often see such an in∣stance of goodness in a poor lad It marked his character as something uncommon He might if he had pleased have had her main∣tained by the parish  About the time of his mother's death he thought of marrying At a little distance from him under the hill lived a labourer of the name of Brooks His daughter Joanna was the person whom Baker fixed on for a wife and no objection being made he mar∣ried her and brought her to his cottage Joanna had lived under a careful mother just in the way in which he himself had always lived and with the same notions of industry and frugality She entered there∣fore into all her husband's intentions What he gained she put to the best use  We both pulled the rope  he used to say  by the same end and so we compassed many things which they cannot do who pull it at different ends  In the mean time his family increased and his industry increased with it He now never worked  by the day  if he could help it  but took the hardest  taskwork  he could get by which the most money was to be earned And that he might  never  be idle he took at a small rent of Mrs John Burrard of Lymington a piece of rough ground about nine or ten acres on which he might employ his leisure Many a time he was seen work∣ing in it before sunrise and if his day'swork had not been hard in an evening by moonlight In a few years he made it worth much more than when he took it and he found it of great use to his family in furnish∣ing him sometimes with a crop of potatoes or a little corn or a few loads of hay which enabled him to keep two or three cows and as many forestcolts Some years after his good landlady died and this piece of land fell into the hands of Mr Brailsfield of Kentishtown who finding it was tenanted by a man who had taken so much pains to improve it promised neither to raise his rent nor to take it from him which I mention to his honour Thus a kind providence blessed all Baker's designs and he was richer than many a man who is born to thousands There are few men who may not live comfortably if they live  according to their station  and if they  do not  the highest stations will not secure them from difficulties I have often heard Baker say he never knew what want was but then he never relaxed his usual frugality When  wheat was dear to make all ends meet he lived on barley and when he could not with convenience compass a bushel of malt he contented himself with milk or water  He had now five children who were a constant claim upon all his industry and frugality But he had other claims He had been kind to his sister tho her behaviour did not intirely please him and he was now called on from a quarter he did not expect His wife's father grown old applied to him for assistance Of this man he never had a high opinion but for his motherinlaw he had always the greatest esteem  She was as good a woman  he used to say  as his wife and he could not say more for any woman on earth  However tho he could not pretend with the incumbrance of so large a family to maintain them intirely he agreed with the overseers of the parish that if they would pay them a shilling a week he would do the rest Accordingly he built them a little cot∣tage and was as kind to them as he could Soon after on the old man's death he took his motherinlaw into his own house and kept her till she died tho she lived till she was upwards of ninety and was blind many years  About the time that his children were pretty well grown up a fortunate circum∣stance happened He received a legacy of seventy pounds and a clock This money  came very happily to settle some of his children  They had it all  he said  among them he never had a bellyfull of meat out of it himself  The clock alone he kept A clock was the only piece of furniture he ever coveted and he always intended if it should be in his power to have purchased one tho it is probable if a clock had not been thus thrown in his way he would alwaps have found something more useful for the employment of his money  Nor was he kind only to his relations As he got forward in the world he was very friendly among his neighbours and lent many a little sum to assist them in their distresses But as he was a very shrewd intelligent man he lent only where he saw his money could be of use To the spendthrift he would lend nothing nor to any man who frequented an alehouse So judi∣cious was he in these loans that altho he helped many a man out of a difficulty I have heard him say he never lost a farthing by lending money in his life Often indeed he received the worth of what he had lent in a little corn a pig a calf or something that was more convenient for the borrower to pay with than money  He was now advancing into years and his good Joanna began to feel the effects of age more than he did Her ailment was a mere decay of nature but she was so intirely  weakened that she could do nothing for herself Her husband hired a woman into the house to attend her near seven years in which she continued in this helpless state Every thing he could do he did for a woman  who  he said  had been kinder to every body than herself  In the year she died and left him greatly afflicted for the loss of a faithful friend who had followed close by his side through all his laborious life for the space of forty years I have seen him speak of her with tears in his eyes and agitation in all he said at the age of eighty  He had now the world in a manner to begin again His children were all married or dispersed and he had nobody with him on whose arm he could lean in descending the hill He thought the wisest thing he could do was to draw his little matters into as small a compass as he could and rid himself as much as possible of the cares of the world Accordingly he sold his cows and horses and a little tenement or two which he had purchased and brought one hundred and ten pounds to a friend to put to some use  For as I cannot now  said he  work myself I must make my money  as he phrased it  work for me  His friend made him understand as well as he could what was meant by the funds and advised him to put his money into the consolidated an∣nuities for twentyeight years from january  As this transaction was in the year when the funds were low he was made to understand that the interest would be considerable about eight pounds a year but that the whole would be lost if he should live twentysix years However as he did not look forward to that time he took his friend's advice Besides this property he had two or three other little sums put out to interest in private hands and a little tene∣ment which he reserved for himself to live in with two or three patches of ground which lay near him and served to employ him  He had a good opinion of the charitable societies or  clubs  as they are called in the several parishes around him but he thought them useful chiefly to those who could not depend upon themselves If young fellows could depend on themselves and lay the same money by without breaking into it he thought it might generally be more useful to them Fourpence a week would amount to near a pound in the year At harvest some little matter might be added to it And if this practice were begun early in life in a few years it might amount to a com∣fortable support in sickness or oldage  But few young fellows  he said  looked forward to those times They never thought of more than of living from hand to mouth  His manner  now  of spending his time was somewhat different from what it used to be He worked only a little every morn∣ing in his grounds or in his garden or in procuring fuel The rest of his time he spent in reading and in devotion He had always been a serious man but a busy life had never allowed him much time for any thing but business He had now gotten above the worldhad his time much to him∣selfand spent a great part of it in reading the bible which was the only book he did read He had the use of his eyes to the last and generally tho by himself read out which he thought made the more impression on his memory Oftner than once as I have approached his lonely cottage I have thought I heard voices but when I entered the old man was sitting alone with his bible before him He had as strong natural parts as I almost ever met with and easily understood not only the general meaning and intention of the gospel but many of the more difficult passages in it What our Saviour said he thought was very easy and much of what St Paul said And he told me he had a very good book of prayers in his phrase  for all intents and purposes  As he grew more and more infirm his friends thought it comfortless for him to live intirely by himself and endeavoured to per∣suade him to get some good old woman to  live with him who might take care of his house and likewise of him if any thing should ail him  Aye  said he  if I could get some good old woman but where is she to be found  He had tried the experiment he said but had no incouragement to try it again People would not he added live now as he lived Perhaps he had bad luck in his choice but he found that a woman now would spend as much in junketting in one day as would serve him for two Then he said there was such constant gossipping and noise in his house that he could never have his time at his own disposal In short he was obliged to live as they chose not as he chose himself Then fetching a deep sigh he would say  His good Joanna had spoiled him for living with any other woman  It was then proposed to him to live with one of his daughters who was married in the neighbourhoodHe had thought of that he said but an old man was always giving offence to one or another and one or ano∣ther was always giving offence to him Besides he said his daughter had several children and so much noise did not suit his quiet way of living He could now at his own ease follow his own inclination In short it appeared that while he lived he wished to live intirely to himself and that it was very indifferent to him when and where and how he died  The destitute condition however in which he lived laid him open to the depredations of a dishonest neighbourhood Many little thefts when he was watched out of his house were committed Among other things his pewterflaggon was stolen It hung over his dresser and contained all his little se∣curities and promissory notes He had however with his usual sagacity placed his money in such safe hands that he had on this occasion no loss  But among the petty thefts which were committed in his house was a robbery of a very serious nature On the day before Lymingtonfair the old man had received some interest money about five guineas to purchase a few necessaries This being probably known two men at midnight broke into his house His fastening in∣deed was only such as a good shake might easily dislodge They soon entered and one of them pressing a bolster over his face pinned him down with his knee while the other sought for the money which was pre∣sently found I heard him speak of the transaction the next day and his behaviour raised him in my opinion He spoke with the caution of an honest man The thieves had a dark lantern he said with them and he thought he could swear to one of them but he durst not venture it where a man's life and character were concerned  From several circumstances however it became more probable that the man whom Baker suspected was guilty And indeed he himself soon after confirmed the suspicion for as the neighbours began more to talk of the thing and to lay facts together he thought it prudent to leave the country Indeed if wicked men would only consider beforehand the many circumstances that lead to discovery and the almost impossi∣bility of providing against them all they would be more cautious on the mere prin∣ciples of prudence in committing any des∣perate wickedness One circumstance which tended to fix the suspicion of the fact on this man was that a child accidentally men∣tioned having seen a cutcheese in his house the day after the robbery Baker had lost a cutcheese and it was wellknown the man had no cheese in his house before The other person too was suspected but if either of them had been taken up it would most probably have discovered both for a knave cannot be depended on And indeed it is probable that both would have been discovered had it not been for the old man's scruplesI mention all these circum∣stances to shew that in fact it requires more care and caution to commit a wick∣ed action than most men possess It is indeed less difficult to be industrious and  by that means to make a wicked action unnecessary  Notwithstanding however the old man was thus so frequently preyed on by wicked people he still continued to live alone As to any farther losses he had one way he said of preventing them and that was to keep nothing about him that was worth stealing He fastened therefore the old bolt upon his door and went to sleep in his lonely cottage as quietly as if he had been in a castle  Tho he had now enough before him he continued still to live with his usual fru∣gality Many of his neighbours thought he might have indulged his age a little more as he had the means to do it and as they themselves probably would have done in the same circumstances by which they might have spent all they had laid up for their old age not knowing how long God might have lengthened out their lives He lived however as he had been accustomed to live in the best of his days for in many parts of his life he had been put to shifts He had always good cheese in his house and good bread which was his common food He used to brew also now and then a bushel of malt so that he was seldom without a little cask of beer His garden produced him plenty of cabbages which was the only plant he reared and every year he bought  at Lymington fair a side of bacon a bit of which he would now and then put into his pot with a cabbage Fresh meat he never tasted nor were butter and tea among his necessaries On this provision he never had a day's sickness and even at those times when his food was less nourishing he was able to do every thing to which the strength of man is equalWhat can the art of cook∣ery do more  He was now near eighty his limbs be∣gan to fail and he was subject to rheumatic pains which seized his right leg and made exercise very troublesome to him Not∣withstanding however this infirmity and his living a mile from the church he rarely missed taking a painful walk to it every sun∣day The weather must have been very bad to prevent him And tho he was now become very deaf he did not think even that a reason for keeping from church What an example did he set to those who tho in perfect health instead of making the sabbath a day for obtaining instruction and begging God's blessing on the week pro∣fane it by making it a day of pastime and often a day of drinking and other wicked∣nessHe was constant also at the sacrament which he always esteemed a part of his duty  He was confined to his house about six weeks before he died His illness was a mere decay of nature His legs swelled and his constitution was broken up He  now submitted to have somebody live in his cottage with him He was pressed to send for a physician as he had the means to pay him but he was resolute against it  If you could find me a doctor  said he  who would tell me at once I can do you good or I cannot do you good I would send for him but else why should I send for a man to be paid for giving me physic when I cannot take victuals  In short he knew he was dying and wished to die with as little molestation as he could  He kept his bed about three days and was sensible to the last He was in con∣siderable pain but he bore it with that firmness and manliness with which he had supported all the hard duties of a persevering life of industry He died on the th day of may and desired that the st psalm might be sung before his corps as he was carried through the churchyard to his grave The thought was new and the decency and propriety of it had a good effect  On his death his effects amounted to about four hundred pounds That a man in the lowest station with a constant attention to money should in the course of a long life raise that sum or a greater is not wonder∣ful but that a man in the lowest station should leave such a sum behind him after discharging all the offices of life with up∣rightness and propriety is such an example  of an independent spirit and of the force of in∣dustry and frugality as deserves to be re∣corded for the benefit of others The following inscription stands over his grave in Boldrechurch yard  Here  Rests from his labour  William Baker  Whose industry and frugality  Whose honesty and piety  Were long an example  To this parish  He was born in  And died in  THE END
