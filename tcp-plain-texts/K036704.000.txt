 A CURE FOR THE HEARTACHE A  COMEDY  IN FIVE ACTS AS PERFORMED AT THE  THEATREROYAL COVENTGARDEN  By THOMAS MORTON Esq AUTHOR OF COLUMBUS ZORINSKI WAY TO GET MARRIED AND CHILDREN IN THE WOOD  DUBLIN Printed by P WOGAN Old Bridge  PROLOGUE  WRITTEN BY T W FITZGERALD Esq Spoken by Mr Macready  WHEN invalids possess both faith and wealth  They'll find a nostrum to restore their health  A  panacea  advertis'd to cure  Each ill the human body can endure  But our bold Author claims a nobler art  And advertises to relievethe heart  So many patients he expects to see  That I'm appointed as his deputy  Now then your mental maladies explain  And I'll remove or mitigate the pain  Does love or jealousy your peace molest  Revenge inflame ambition gnaw your breast  For jealousy a sovereign balm behold  The husband's certain cure a pill of gold  This dose administer'd with prudent care  Dispels at once the frailties of the fair  Deprives the proctor of his  crim con  fee  And tunes the chord that jar'd to harmony  Should love torment some Romeo's heated brain  Or agonize a Juliet's breast with pain  Let them my potent remedy apply  The maid shall cease to pine the youth to sigh  Gold shall restore each drooping lover's health  And passion sind a substitute in wealth  But let not illtim'd ridicule degrade  What Heav'n when well applied a blessing made  To foster merit wheresoever found  And with improvement cheer a country round  To feed the hungry and to clothe the poor  And send the beggar happy from the door  To mitigate the horrors of despair  And make the family of want our care  To succour genius drooping in distress  Making the business of our lives to bless  When the rich man can such employment find  We wish his purse as ample as his mind  For one poor patient I've an anxious fear  And you must be his kind physician here  Our Author has to night so much at stake  He finds his throbbing heart inclin'd to ache  But should his play a lib'ral audience please  Your warm applause will set his heart at ease  DRAMATIS PERSONAE     LONDON  DUBLIN  Sir Hubert Stanley  Mr Murray  Mr Richardson  Charles Stanley  Mr Pope  Mr Montague  Vortex  Mr Quick  Mr Kenedy

BRONZE  Ellen  Good Mr Bronze have you been at Sir Hubert Stanley's  Bronze  Yes ma'am  Ellen  Is Charles Stanley arrived  Bronze  No ma'am but he is hourly expected  Ellen  Do they say he is wellquite recovered  Bronze  I don't know ma'amupon my soulI beg pardon but really the Baronet's house is horrid vulgar compared to your uncle's the Nabob's here I peeped thro' my glass into an old hall and beheld fifty paupers at dinner such wretches and the Baronet himself walking round the table to see them properly fedHow damn'd lowUgh I would bett a rump and dozen our second table is more genteelerer than Sir Hubert's ownbut I must away for we expect the rich Miss VortexI beg pardon but your name and the Nabob's  daughter being the same we call her the rich to distinguish  Ellen  And you do wiselyno term of distinction cou'd possibly be more significant or better understood by the world than that you have adopted  Bronze  Hope no offence ma'am  Ellen  None Bronze go in  Bronze  The last man on earth to offend a fine woman  Exit  Ellen  The rich Miss Vortexmost trueBut now my dear Charles Stanley is return'd I claim the superior title of the Happy Oh Charles when we parted last at Spa how great the contrast thy animated form was prison'd in the icy fetters of disease thy pale and quiv'ring lip refused a last adieuBut ah a smile that seemed borrowed from a seraph who waited to bear thee up to Heaven swore for thee everlasting love That smile supported me in solitudebut to solitude I have now bade adieu and to be near the lord of my heart have again enter'd this house the palace of ruinous luxury and licentious madness but here comes its whimsical proprietor  Enter  Mr VORTEX  with a paper in his hand attended by black and white servants  Vortex  Sublimeoh the fame of this speech will spread to Indostan Ehdon't I smell the pure air in this room Oh you villains would you destroy me throw about the perfumes for legislative profundity for fancy and decoration'tis a speech  Ellen  What speech is it Sir  Vortex  Ah Ellenwhy my maiden speech in Parliamentit will alarm all EuropeI'll speak it to you  Ellen  No my dear uncle not just nowI hear you've been ill  Vortex  Oh verya strange agitation at my heart and such a whizzing and spinning in my head  Ellen  I hope you've had advice  Vortex  Oh yes I've had them allOne physician told me it was caused by too brilliant and effervescent a geniusthe next said it was the scurvy a third it proceeded from not eating pepper to a melonanother had the impudence to hint it was only little qualms that agitated some gentlemen who had made fortunes in Indiaone recommended a sea voyageanother a flannel nightcapone prescrib'd waterthe other brandy but however they all agreed in this essential point that I'm not to be contradicted but have my way in every thing  Ellen  An extremely pleasant prescription certainly But under these circumstances do you hold it prudent uncle to become a parliamentary Orator I believe a little  gentle  contradiction is usual in that House  Vortex  I know itbut if you will hear my speech you will see how I manageI begin Sir  Enter  Servant  Serv  Your daughter sir is arrived from Town  Ellen  Thank you cousin for this relief  Aside  Vortex  Zounds I'm not to be interrupted  Serv  She is here sir  Enter Miss  VORTEX  Miss Vor  My dear Nabob uncommon glad to see you Ah Ellen what tired of seclusion and a cottage  Ellen  I hope cousin I am welcome to you  Miss Vor  Certainly you know we are uncommon glad to see any body in the countrybut my dear Nabob you don't inquire about the opening of our townhouse  Vortex  I was thinking of my speech  Miss Vor  The most brilliant housewarming uncommon full above a thousand peopleevery body there  Ellen  Pray cousin do you then visit every body  Miss Vor  Certainly they must ask me  Ellen  Must I shou'd imagine that wou'd depend on inclination  Miss Vor  Inclination psha I beg your pardon but you are really uncommon ignorant my dear They must ask me I tell youNow suppose a Dutchess rash enough to shut me from her parties very wellShe names a nightI name the same and give an entertainment greatly surpassing her's in splendour and profusionWhat is the consequence why that her rooms are as deserted as an Exminister's levee and mine cramm'd to suffocation with her Grace's most puissant and noble friendsHa ha my dear Ellen the court of St James's run after a good supper as eagerly as the court of AldermenHa ha your being in this country Nabob was thought quite charmingA host not being at home to receive his guests is uncommon new and elegant isn'tHere we improve my dear on ancient hospitalitythose little memorandums Nabob will give you an idea of the sort of thing  Vortex  Reads  "March"Oh that's a delightful month when Nature produces nothing and every thing is forc'dLet me see" quarts of green peas at five guineas a quart"that was pretty well" peaches"at what" a guinea each"Oh too cheap  Miss Vor  'Tis very true but I assure you I tried every where to get them dearer but cou'd not  Vortex  And I suppose the new white sattin furniture was all spoil'd  Miss Vor  Oh entirelyand the pier glasses shivered to pieces so delightfully  Vortex  Well I hope you had the whole account put in the papers  Miss Vor  Certainly else what would have been the use of giving the fete Then the company such charming eccentricity such characters out of characterWe had a noble Peer bowing for custom to his shop and an Alderman turning over the music leaves for the celebrated Soprano an Orator's lady detailing her hnsband's three hours speech in Parliament and the Orator himself describing how puppets are managed at the Fantoccini we had grandmothers making assignations with boys and the children of Israel joining the host of PharaohOh my dear Miss Vortex why don't you partake in these charming scenes  Ellen  My dear Miss Vortex six suppers would annihilate my fortune  Miss Vor  Oh true I forgot your uncommon small fortune But I don't think it much signifies I swear people of fashion in town seem to do as well without money as with it You might be successful at play There are points to be learnt which certainly do not give you the worst of the game Come will you be my protegée  Ellen  Excuse me coussn I dare say I ought to be covered with blushes when I own a vulgar detestation of the character of a female gamester and I must decline the honor of your introduction to the haut ton till at least they have justice on their side  Miss Vor  An uncommon odd girl Nabob  Ellen  Heavens to what state of abject degradation must fashionable society be reduced when officers of police are as much dreaded by ladies in the purlieus of St James's as they are by cut purses in the wretched haunts of St Giles  Miss Vor  For shame Ellen to censure your own sex  Ellen  No madam I am its advocate and in that sex's name protest an abhorrence of those women who do not consider any thing shameful but to be ashamed of any thing whose resemblance to nature and innocence exists but in their nakedness and to whom honour is only known as a pledge at a gaming table  Exit  Miss Vor  Did you ever hear Nabob  Vortex  I did not hear a word she said I was thinking of my speech  Miss Vor  A pert Gothic lowbred creature But her contemptible fortune suits uncommon well with her grovelling ideas  Vortex  Don't talk of her fortune it always makes my poor head worse You know at the time I gave her five thousand pounds in lieu of what I called her expectations I had in my hands an enormous sum of her's O dear I'm afraid the doctor was rightah mine are certainly East India qualmsI wonder if giving her fifty thousand back again wou'd do my heart any good  Miss Vor  What my dear Nabob I declare you quite shock me  Vortex  Oh conscience  Miss Vor  Conscience he he a thing so uncommon vulgar a thing so completely chausseed besides yon know very well it is absolutely impossible to exist under l ayear  Vortex  That's very true  Miss Vor  Some people certainly do contrive to grub on with ten thousand but how they do it is to me miraculous then think of your intention of marrying me to the son of your great rival the baronet think of his borough  Vortex  Ah very trueConscience avaunt I have made a motion on matrimony to Sir Hubert  Miss Vor  And young Stanley's arrival Oh what a sweet youth  Vortex  Oh what a sweet borough interest But I am glad your heart is interested  Miss Vor  Heart interested Lud how can you suspect me of so uncommon vulgar a sensation I trust my joy is occasioned by ideas more becoming a woman of fashionI am charm'd because his fortune is large his family ancient and because my marriage will render all my female friends so uncommon miserable and because I suspect that Ellen met young Stanley at Spa and that she dares aspire to  Vortex  I wish she were out of the house  Miss Vor  Noshe shall stay to witness my triumph  Vortex  Shall  stayI'm not to be contradicted you knowmy physicians  Miss Vor  Certainly not my dear Nabob but I may recommend I'm sure no physician would object to your taking advice Ah does Ellen love you as I dowill she listen to your speech as I intend to dowould she throw away thousands for you in a night as I do  Vortex  Very true very true  Exeunt  SCENE III  A Pleasure Ground and View of

Exeunt  HEARTLEY  and  Servants  Charles so mix'd is the cup of life that this day the happiest thy old father can e'er hope to see is dash'd with bitterness and sorrow boy I've been a very unthrift

improve either the morals or happiness of mankind determin'd to persevere in the ways of my fathers Soon after you went abroad the adjoining estate was purchased by an East Indian groaning under wealth produc'd by groans Like the viper after collecting in the warm sunshine his bag of venom he came to the abode of peace and innocence and disseminated his poison But mark methink me not so unjust boy as with random slander to censure any body of men No thank heaven there are numbers whom Providence in addition to the power has added the will to render wealth a blessing to all around them  Charles  You are ever just and liberal  Sir Hub  But for this vile exception this Mr Vortex I tell thee riot contention indolence and vice succeeded I struggled against this mischies which spurr'd him on to oppose me in my election This contest I trust Charlea you think  the dignity of your family demanded itthis contest I say obliged me to mortgage my estate to a considerable amount and I fear boy even that will not sufficeDost thou not blame thy father  Charles  Blame sir my fortune nay my life is held but to promote your happiness  Sir Hub  Glorious boy then all will be well againthy estate restor'd thy wealth enlarg'd  Charles  How  Sir Hub  By marriage Charles  Charles averts his face with dejection  Charles  Marriage sirTo conceal the passion that triumphs here were but to deceive a father and injure the bright excellence I love When I was ill at Spa the votaries of pleasure avoided me as the harbinger of melancholy and I was despis'd as a thing passing into oblivion by all but one fair creature I obtain'd an opportunity to thank her for the charitable pity her eye had beam'd on me Love soon kindled his torch at Pity's altar for I found in Miss Vortex such excellence  Sir Hub  Who  Charles  Miss Vortex sir  Sir Hub  From India  Charles  The same  Sir Hub  She that is now propos'd for your alliance  Charles  Is it possible  Sir Hub  And waits your

ANDREWS ESQ M P SPOKEN BY MRS MATTOCKS  SHAKESPEARE a shrewd old quiz in his dull age  Said very gravely "All the world's a stage"  But if the Poet on our times could drop  He'd rather own that  "all the world's a shop"  "And what's the trade" exclaim the critic railers  Why "Men and women all are merely taylors"  Nay frown not Beaux and Ladies do not pout  You've all your  cuttings in  and  cuttings out  And first Miss Hoyden just escap'd from school  Slighting mamma and all domestic rule  If she on fashion's road should chance to trip  What says the world why "Miss has made a slip  And if a falling character to save  She weds with age just tott'ring o'er the grave  The sportive world will still enjoy the joke  And spouse at home at once is made a cloke  The Politician too who when  in  place  Views public measures with a smiling sace  Croaks when he's  out  a discontented note  Sure he's a taylorhe has turn'd his coat  Oft have I measur'd you when closely sitting  To see what

indeedyour elbows show it  Don't tremble man there's now no cause for fears  Though oft you shirk the Gemmen of the sheers  Genius stands still when taylors interpose  'Tis like a watchit ticksand

patriot Paddy hot from BantryBay  assuming the Brogue  "The Frenchmen came expecting us to meet 'em  "And sure we all were ready there to greet 'em  "With piping hot potatoes made of lead  "And powder
