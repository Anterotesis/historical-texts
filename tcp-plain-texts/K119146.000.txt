 LETTERS TO PARTICULAR FRIENDS  BY WILLIAM SHENSTONE  Esq  From the Year to  DUBLIN Printed for H SAUNDERS W SLEATER D CHAMBERLAINE J POTTS J WILLIAMS and W COLLES Booksellers MDCCLXX  PREFACE  THOUGH the Character of Mr  Shenstone  is too well known and his reputation as a Writer too firmly established to require any further commendation yet it may perhaps be expected that some apology should be made for this volume of his Works containing Familiar Letters to some of his most intimate Friends  To these who may think such an apology re∣quisite it might be sufficient to say that the reception which the former volumes have met with affords the strongest reason to believe that an addition to them would be very accepta∣ble to the Public and that the author's talent in  epistolary  writing appears not to have been inferior to that which distinguishes his other compositions  But it may be objected that whatever their merit may be  Letters  not intended for the Public ought not to be published and that an act of this kind is a violation of private friendship  This objection it must be confessed carries with it such an air of delicacy that the persons here concerned are very willing to give it all due attention At the same time they cannot but observe that it will not hold in all cases and therefore must unavoidably be subject to some limitationsthat these limitations must  vary as the circumstances of cases happen to varyand that not to make proper allowances for such circumstances is highly unreasonableinjurious to many who have deserved well of the Public by this very conduct and detrimen∣tal to the interests of Literature It might perhaps be difficult and is by no means necessa∣ry to enumerate these several limitations It will be sufficient in this place to say that where neither the reputation of the Writer nor that of any other person is injured there the force of the objection evidently ceases And it is not only believed on the most mature deliberation that this is the case in the present instance but moreover that the there are posi∣tive good reasons in its favour respecting as well the Writer's character in this  species  of compo∣sition as the satisfaction and entertainment of the Reader  The encouragement which has been usually given to Works of this nature might seem to make these observations unnecessary But it was not thought sufficient barely to shelter this publication under the sanction of such an autho∣rity as it is well known that the wantonness of curiosity has sometimes encouraged design by no means justifiableand it is as readily acknowledged that the following Letters are deficient in many particulars requisite to excite that curiosity being neither written on popular subjects nor addressed to persons of rank and eminence in the world They will not fail how∣ever to afford an agreeable entertainment to such as can relish an animated display of the various efforts of a fine imagination for a length of years whether amusing itself with  rural embellishments or occupied in other plea∣sures of learned retirement and a warm disin∣terested friendship Such are the subjects of the following Letters and if any person should still retain a doubt concerning the propriety of perpetuating them in this manner he shall be finally referred to the writer's own authority who in a letter dated October thus expresses himself  I confess to you that I am considerably mortified by Mr W's conduct in regard to those Letters meaning his own letters to that gentleman's brother and rather than they should have been so unnecessarily destroyed would have given more money than it is allowa∣ble for me to mention with decency I look upon my letters as some of my  chefd'aeuvres  and could I be supposed to have the smallest pre∣tensions to propriety of style or sentiment I should imagine it must appear principally in my Letters to his brother and one or two more friends I consider them as the records of a friendship that will be alway dear to me and as the history of my mind for these twenty years past  When it is considered how seldom so valuable a collection of real correspondence is to be met with and how difficult it is to supply the want of it by a fictitious one it cannot be doubted that the Public will be pleased to see the loss here complained of so well repaired and to be furnished with such genuine examples of the Author's style and sentiments together with an authentic history of his mind for so long a space of time  To conclude The talents of this Author on whatever subject they were exercised were so uncommon and the fame of his little  Ferme ornée  under the conduct of a taste entirely original was become so considerable that every specimen of the one and every anecdote relative to the improvement of the other seemed too interesting to be buried in oblivion at least they were thought so by those to whom the  greater  part of this Collection is addressedpersons indeed confessedly partial to the Writer's talents and interested in his commendations but at the same time persons neither so regard∣less of their Friend's reputation nor their own as to have hazarded either without the strong∣est persuasion that their partiality had not im∣posed upon their judgement and that it was no indecent ostentation in them by this public act to testify that they esteemed it not only a peculiar felicity in their fortunes but likewise some degree of credit to have enjoyed the plea∣sures of such a friendship throughout so consi∣derable a period of human life  CONTENTS  LETTER TO Mr JAGO with a Song and the Author's Sentiments on Musical Compo∣sition  p    LETTER II To the same in the Manner of Pamela  LETTER III To a Friend too ceremoniously

Sentiments on Musical Composition    Dear Sir  AS my head is considerably more confused than usual by reason of a bad cold I shall aim no higher in this letter than at bare  recitative  reserving all my  airs  for a season when my mind is more in  tune  Such I hope will be the time which you set apart to attend the  chief musician  at Birmingham I thoroughly design to lend an  ear  to  his  performance on con∣dition he will not refuse one to a proposal I in∣tend to make of having one day or other a merry strain at the Leasows But if you have any  penchant  to see the face of your humble servant at Birmingham your most effectual way will be to inform him when these solemn nup∣tials betwixt Tweedledum and Tweedledee are to be consummated I will  certes  not be absent at the throwing of the stocking any more than  Parson Evans in Shakespeare would be  "absence at the grace"  I have sent a song not that I am sure I have not sent it before but that if you can see any joke that it containeth the forementioned gentleman may be asked to tran∣slate it into music When I use this expression you will peradventure look upon it as my opinion that in musical compositions sound ought as much to answer sense as one language does another insomuch that such and such thoughts ought to bring into our heads such and such sounds and  vice versa  But in case there is no sense and no thought the more languages a sentence is translated into the more 'tis expo∣sed And in case it be the misfortune of my little piece to have neither I beg that Mr Mar∣riett may not inform any body what it signifies in music As a farther proof of the confused state of my intellects you see almost at the end of my letter my thanks for the packet c which ought to have been placed in the very front of it in order to express in some degree the sense I have of your favours I long to see you and am dear Sir  Your most obedient and faithful servant W SHENSTONE  SONG  WHEN bright Ophelia treads the green  In all the pride of dress and mien  Averse to freedom mirth and play  The lofty rival of the day  Methinks to my enchanted eye  The lilies droop the roses die  But when disdaining art the fair  Assumes a soft engaging air  Mild as the op'ning morn of May  And as the feather'd warblers gay  The scene improves where'er she goes  More sweetly smile the pink and rose  O lovely maid propitious hear  Nor think thy Damon insincere  Pity my wild delusive flame  For tho' the flow'rs are still the same  To me they languish or improve  And plainly tell me that I love  II To the same in the Manner of PAMELA    WELL and so I sate me down in my  room  and was reading  Pamela  one might furnish this book with several pretty decorations thought I to myself and then I began to design cuts for it in particular places For instance one where Pamela is forced to fall upon her knees in the arbor a second where she is in bed and Mrs Jewkes holds one hand and Mr B the other a third where Pamela sits sew∣ing in the summerhouse c So I just sketched them out and sent my little hints such as they were to Mr Rn As soon as I had sealed my letter in comes Mrs Arnold  His housekeeper of whom very respectful mention is made in the course of this correspondence    "Well Mrs Arnold" says I "this Mr Jago never comeswhat can one do I'm as dull as a beetle for want of company"  "Sir" says she "the hen"  "What makes you out of breath"  says I "Mrs Arnold what's the matter"  "Why Sir" says she "the hen I set last sab∣bathdaywasthreeweeks has just hatched and has brought out all her eggs to good"  "That's brave indeed" says I  "Ay that it is" says she "so be and't please Gd an how that they liven there'll be a glorious parcel of 'em Shall I bring 'em up for you to see" says she  "No thank ye Mrs Arnold" says I "but aren't ye in some apprehensions from the kite Mrs Arnold"  "No Sir" says she "I hope there's no danger I  takes  pretty good care of 'em"  "I don't question your care" says I "for you're seldom without a duck or a chicken about you"  "Poor pretty  creters  " says she "look here Master this has gotten a speck of black upon her tail"  "Ay I thought you wern't without one about you" says I "I don't think" says I "Mrs Arnold but your soul was design'd for a hen originally"  "Why and if I  had  been a hen" says she "I believe I should have done as much for my chickens as yonder great blackandwhite hen does tho' I say't that should not say't" says she  "Ay that you would" thought I "Well but now when Jago comes have you got e'er a chicken that's  fit to kill  "No" says she "I doubt there is ne'eraone"  "Well" says I "Mrs Arnold you and your chicken may go down I am going to write a letter"  So I sat down and wrote thus far scrattle scrattle goes the penwhy how now says Iwhat  s the mat∣ter with the pen So I thought I would make an end of my letter because my pen went scratle scrattle Well I warrant I shall have little plea sure when Mr Jago  comes  for I never fixed my heart upon any thing in my life but some misfor∣tune happened to balance my pleasureAfter all thought I it must be some very ill accident that outweighs the pleasure I shall take in seeing him  W SHENSTONE  Leasows  July  III To a Friend too ceremoniously declining to purchase a Horse for him    SIR  I CANNOT avoid imagining the first part of your letter was mere raillery I am sure it gave me a good deal of pleasure for I can bear very well to hear my foibles exposed though not my faults and on that account must needs make grateful mention of it I acknowledge the oddness of the letter which occasioned it and could not expect that such an illformed appli∣cation could have produced an answer so very oratorical In the first place you lay open the subject or indeed what you call the offices in which I am pleased to employ you In the next you alledge your own inability to enter upon matters of such great concernment That this is rhetorical nay pure rhetoric I gather from the exordiums of all the declamations that I ever heard in my life 'Tis moreover not uncommon with declaimers to give some reasons why they should not absolutely decline the sub∣ject though they are sensible of their insufficiency otherwise they might be expected to sit down and hold their tongues And this is what you have done by saying that you are unwilling to dissent from the world in regard to the subjects you are engaged in That you therefore chose to steer a middle course by that means avoiding the imputation of presumption on the one hand and indifference on the other When this is done you enter gravely upon the subject and to give it a greater perspicuity divide it into two parts The first part happens to be  "concerning the purchase of  an  horse"  On this occasion you inform me that I am in a good country for horses and secondly that I have a number of  acquaintance round about me who are very well skilled in the nature of them Now each of these informations seems at first sight to mean no more than what I have better opportunities of knowing than the person who informs me and on this account to err in point of super∣fluity But upon second thoughts they have  this force  to speak like a grammarian namely that I am entirely negligent of my own affairs and secondly that I care not whom I give trouble to if I can but avoid it myself so that the senten∣ces have really a beauty when one searches be∣neath their superficies After you have said this and more which includes all that can be said upon the subject you descend to the second division in relation to which I am too grateful to be otherwise than  seri  us  in my acknowledgments  I had not expatiated thus far but to shew that I am not insensible of a sneer nor should I expa∣tiate any farther but to prove that I am equally sensible of a favour  I desire you would believe that I absolutely assent to your critique That some of your sen∣timents were my own before I communicated the verses and others as soon as you had favoured me with the discovery of them That I would  per praesentes  return my thanks for them which you might justly have claimed whether I had approved them or not One exception to this approbation my modesty bids me mention on account of your too great partiality in my fa∣vour My gratitude you are entitled to without exception or limitation  It will perhaps gratify your curiosity to know that Mr G has a copy of verses in the last magazine entitled  "The little Cur"  There are several strokes that are picturesque and hu∣morous I believe it was done in haste The motto is exquisite and much more properly ap∣plied by Mr G than the Emperor Adrian in  my opinion notwithstanding all that Pope says Tell me your judgment of Mr Ln's in the same paper The epigram  "To one who refused to walk in the Park c"  is a good one  I have waved sending the verses to Mr Somer∣vile at present because I hope to see you soon either at the Leasows or at Birmingham I can't tell whether I shall have time to inclose in this letter my ballad If I do consider it only as some words that I chuse to make use of to some notes of which I am more than ordinarily fond  The tune  "Come and listen to my ditty c"  The words sounded upon a true history of Queen Elizabeth who looking from a castle wherein she was a prisoner and seeing a country milkmaid singing expressed great envy at the girl's condition and dissatisfaction with regard to her own  It is as much designed for my own singing in private I mean as ever was a bottle of cherrybrandy for an old woman's drinking Now I think of it I really believe that I every day approach nearer and nearer to the capacity the way the insignificancy of an old woman Mrs Arnold has certainly by her  charms  her incantations and her conversations together contributed a good deal to this transformation Pray come over if you can and try to reinstate me in my right mind in proportion to the soundness of which I shall be more and more  Your friend and servant W S  IV To the same from Town    Dear Sir  I RETURN you my thanks most heartily for the poetical resentment which you have shewn against my censurers the Riddlemasters I have sent Mr Somervile's verses and yours to Cave though I am ashamed to own I neglected it so long that I fear he will have no room for them this month If you can extirpate false wit in a manner you will do no small service to the true you do no small  honour  to it whether you extirpate the other or not  You have heard of the motion have heard probably all that I can tell you of it That it was illconcerted that it has done the opposition great disservice that the King is now confirmed in the opinion of Sir Robert's honesty that the younger Mr Pitt's speech was the most admired on the opposite side and Sir Rt's on the court side that they did not leave the House till five in the morning that Sir Rt and Py are so violent that the Spr is con∣tinually calling them to order finally that the affair has occasioned this print which I address to your curiosity merely though the lines upon the Bishop are humourous enoughNow I men∣tion curiosity do you take notice of the many quaint contrivances made use of to catch people's n  tural inquisitiveness in the pamphlets viz  "Are these things so""Yes they are""What then""The devil of a story""Hoy boys""Up go we"  And a thousand others What do you think must be my expence who love to pry into every thing of this kind Why truly one shilling My company goes to George's Coffeehouse where for that small sub∣scription I read all pamphlets under a threeshilling  dimensions and indeed any larger ones would not be fit for coffeehouse perusalLord Dudley lent me two sermons given him at the House of Lords which I read last night In the first there are a great many deep animad∣versions delivered in a style that is tolerable in the other there is as great a want of common English as there is plenty of common observa∣tions Have you seen the sermons on the Mar∣tyrdom and on the Fastday If you read either send for the first You'll find me degenerate from a gentle bard into a snarling critic if my poem does not please you'll say I am no very candid one at present but let its fate be what it will I shall lay no small stress upon the opi∣nion of some that have approved it As it is at present  in keeping  it discovers no uncommon impudence and runs no very great risque but who can answer for it when it has the grace∣lessness to  come upon the townOra pro nobis  must soon be my motto It virtues and faults will then be incapable of addition or diminu∣tion and the pious assistance of friends mustbut I am no Roman CatholicThe intrinsic merit of a book when it is printed as well as the past life and conversation of a man that is departed must damn or give it immortalityI mean to a certain degreeI scrible what comes uppermost and desire you would do the same  Yours W S  V To a Friend from London describing his Temper and Manner of Living there  From Mr Wintle's Per∣fumer near TempleBar c  th Feb  Dear Sir  I AM now with regard to the  town  pretty much in the same state in which I expect to be always with regard to the  world  sometimes exclaiming and railing against it sometimes giv∣ing it a good word and even admiring it A sunshiny day a tavernsupper after a play well acted and now and then an invigorating breath of air in the Mall never fail of producing a chearful effect I don't know whether I gave you any account of Quin's acting Falstaff in my former letter I really imagined that I saw you littering on one side me shaking your sides and sometimes scarce containing yourself You'll pardon the attitude in which I placed you since at was what seemed  natural  at that circumstance of time Comus I have once been at for the sake of the songs though I detest it in any  light  but as a  dramatic  piece the  taking  of it seems a  prodigy  yet indeed  suchaone  as was pretty to∣lerably accounted for by a gentleman who sate by me in the  boxes  This learned sage being asked how he liked the play made answer  "He could not tellpretty well he thoughtor indeed as well as any other playhe always took it that people only came there to see and to be seenfor as for what was said he owned he never understood any thing of the matter"  I told him I thought a great many of its admirers were in his case if they would but own it  On the other hand it is amazing to consider to what an universality of learning people make  pretensions here There's not a drawer a chair or hackney coachman but is politician poet and judge of polite literature Chimneyswee∣pers damn the Convention and blackshoeboys cry up the genius of Shakespeare  "The Dan∣ger of writing Verse"  is a very good thing if you have not read it I would recommend it to you as poetical But now I talk of learning I must not omit an interview which I acciden∣tally had the other night in company with Lord D and one Mr C We were taken to sup at a private house where I found a person whom I had never seen before The man behaved exceeding modestly and well till growing a little merry over a bottle and being a little countenanced by the subject we were upon he pulls out of his pocket about half a dozen ballads and distributes them amongst the com∣pany I not finding at first they were of his own composition read one over and finding it a dull piece of stuff contented myself with ob∣serving that it was exceedingly well  printed  But to see the man's face on this occasion would make you pity the circumstance of an author as long as you live His jollity ceased as a flame would do should you pour water upon it and I be∣lieve for about five minutes he spoke not a syllable At length recovering himself he be∣gan to talk about his countryseat about Hough∣ton Hall and soon after desired a health ima∣gining as I found afterwards that Lord D would have given Sir Robert's But he did not naming Sir T L mine which followed was that of Mr L Now who do you think this should be but honest Ralph Freeman at least the writer of the paper so subscribed your father's old friend and intimate Sir Robert's righthand a person that lives elegantly drives six of the best horses in town and plays on St John's organ you know Mr L is not  only Sir Robert's greatest enemy but the Gazet∣teer's proper antagonist We were invited to see him very civilly and indeed the man behaved with the utmost good humour without arro∣gance or any attempts at wit which probably would not have been very successful Ask your father what he would say to me if I should join in the cause with his old friend and take a good annuity under Sir Robert which I be∣lieve I might have and little encouragement God knows have I met with on the other side of the question I say I believe I  might have  because I know a certain person gives pensions of three pound a week to porters and the most illi∣terate stupid fellows you can imagine to talk in his behalf at alehouses where they fit so long a time and are as regularly relieved as one centry relieves another At least tell him that I expect in his answer to my letter which I shall not allow him to assign to you he write some∣thing to confirm me in my integrity and to make me prefer him and you and honesty to lace brocade and the smiles of the ladies  Et Veneri cunis plumis Sardanapali  But I hope to keep my Hercules in view whe∣ther in print or manuscript and though I am as fond of pleasure as most people yet I shall observe the rule  Positam sic tangere noli  I desire I may hear from you next post I have a line or two which I intend for the  sons of utter darkness  as you call them next maga∣zine I would send them to you for your advice but cannot readily find them I like every thing in Mr Somervile's but the running of the last line I think to insert them Should be glad  to have a line or two of  yours  that one may make a bold attack I look on it as  fun  with∣out the least emotion I assure you  I am dear Sir Your faithful scribling slave W SHENSTONE  VI To the same at Bath on his publishing his Poem of the Judgment of HERCULES  From Mr Wintle's  April  My good Friend  I HEARTILY thank you for the service your letter did me And a considerable ser∣vice no doubt it  is  to raise the spirits of a person so habitually dispirited as I have been for some time For this and all former favours as the sullen fellow says in Shakespeare  "I thank you I am not of many words but I thank you"  I beg you would cease to apologize for your letters in the first place it will lay  me  under a necessity of doing  so  and in the next place you may be assured that no friendly letter of yours will ever be otherwise than infinitely agree∣able to me  I sent a letter to Mr Marriett at Bath to be left with you at your former place of residence you will be so kind as to give it to him  If I wish for a  large  fortune it is rather for the sake of my friends than myself or to com∣promise the matter with those moralists who  argue for the universality of  selfinterest  it is to gratify myself in the company and in the gra∣tifications of my friends  Dr Ratcliff has sent me a letter which gives me much  satisfaction  in respect of my poem notwithstanding he cannot forbear adding that he expects to hear since my pen has so well adorned the fable that my conduct will with equal propriety and elegance illustrate the moral However the simple approbation of a  sincere  man affects one more than Pliny's panegyric could do from a more courtly one  There are several errors of the press which neither sagacity nor vigilance itself I now see can prevent and which I beg you to correct with your pen in a copy which I must get you to present to C L together with the inclosed letter Please to be at the expence of having it stitched in purple paper and gilt at the edges and I will repay you  I was loitering yesterday in the coffeeroom when two persons came in welldressed and called for my poem read a page or two and commended the four lines upon Mr L ex∣tremely  "Lov'd by that prince c"  repeated them forty times and in the end got them by heart mentioned them to a  third  person who said he knew of no virtue that the prince  was  fired with and then endeavoured to mimic the prince's way of talking but says he  I'll  shew  the four best lines in the poem and then proceeded to  "'Twas youth's perplexing stage c"  which are flat enough God knowsbut to my first heroes one of them reads  "When great Alci∣des to a grove retir'd"  Ay ay you know Mr L did retire he was in the secession read on you'll find he mentions Delia anon Don't you remember Mr L wrote a song upon Delia but proceedyou'll find he is going to give a description of two ladies of different characters that were in  love with Mr L One was  here he named two names which I have forgot  Upon my word it is fine I believe it is Pope'sbut how comes Pope to praise himself there  "Lov'd by that bard c"  No doubt however it was written by Mr Pope or Mr D  My critics proceeded to the reading of the last simile  immediately without  the lines preced∣ing it and agreeing that it was a very good thing called out for  "The Oeconomy of Love"  So you see  "Laudant  illa  sed  ista  legunt"  is the case A person cannot be supposed vain from the approbation of such critics or else I would not have inserted such a  commendatory  paragraph I never enquire how my poem takes and am  afraid  to do soHowever I find  some do  allow it to be  Mallet  'sI am impatient till I hear from you I shall be here till this day fortnight afterwards at the LeasowsI must add this  "Ne studio nostri  pecces  "  but at the same time also  O defend  Against your judgment your most faithful friend  W S  These  opposite  petitions delineate my state of mind it is well for me that I have you at Bath  VII To Mr JAGO on the Death of his Father  Leasows  Aug  Dear Mr Jago  I FIND some difficulty in writing to you on this melancholy occasion No one can be more unfit to attempt to lessen your grief than myself because no one has a deeper sense of the  cause  of your affliction Though I would by no means be numbered by you amongst the common herd of your acquaintance that tell you they are sorry yet it were impertinent in me to mention a mere friend's concern to a person interested by so many more tender regards Beside I should be glad to alleviate your sorrow and such fort of condolence tends but little to promote that end I do not chuse to flatter you neither could I more especially at this time but though I could perhaps find enough to say to persons of less sense than you I know of nothing but what your own reason must have suggested Concern indeed may have suspended the power of that faculty and upon that pretence I have a few things that I would suggest to you After all it is time alone that  can  and  will  cure  all  afflictions but such as are the consequence of vice and your's I am sure proceeds from a  contrary  principle  I heard accidentally of this sorrowful event and accompanied you to London with the umost concern I wished it was in my power to miti∣gate your griefs by sharing them as I have often found it in yours to augment my pleasures by so doing  All that I can recommend to you is not to confine your eye to any single event in life but to take in your whole circumstances before you repine  When you reflect that you have lost one of the best of men in a father you ought to com∣fort  yourself that you had such a father to whom I cannot forbear applying these lines from Milton  Since to part  Go heav'nly guest ethereal messenger  Sent by whose sovereign goodness we adore  Gentle to me and affable has been  Thy

spend  here  as satisfactory as it is in my power and I hope you will ever look upon me as your hearty friend through all the vissitudes of life  Pray give my humble service to Mrs Jago and your brother  I am with the utmost affection Yours sincerely W SHENSTONE  VIII To Mr REYNOLDS  Leasows    Dear Sir  WONDERFUL were the dangers and difficulties through which I went the night I left you at Barels which I looked upon as ordained by fate for the temporal punishment of obstinacy It was very kind and in charac∣ter for you to endeavour to deter me from the ways of darkness but having a sort of  penchant  for needless difficulties I have an undoubted right to indulge myself in them so long as I do  not insist upon any one's pity It is true these ought not to exceed a certain degree they should be  lenia tormenta  and I must own the labours I underwent that night did not come within the bounds which my imagination had prescribed I cannot forbear mentioning one imminent dangerI rode along a considerable piece of water covered so close with trees that it was as probable I might have pursued the channel which was dangerous as my way out of it Or to put my case in a more poetical light having by night intruded upon an amour betwixt a Woodnymph and a Rivergod I owed my escape to Fortune who conveyed me from the vengeance which they might have taken I put up finally at a little alehouse about ten o'clock and lay all night awake counting the cords which supported me which I could more safely swear to than to either bed or blanket For farther particulars see my epistle to the Pastor Fido of LapworthMr Graves says he should be glad to shew you any civilities in his power upon his own acquaintance and will serve you as far as his vote goes upon my re∣commendation but is afraid without the con∣currence of some more considerable friends your chance will be but small  this  year c If the former part of this news gives you any pleasure I assure you it gives me no less to communicate it and this pleasure proceeds from a principle which would induce me to serve you myself if it should ever be in my powerI saw Mr Lyttleton last week he is a candidate for the county of Worcester together with Lord Deer∣hurst I hope Mr Somervile will do him the honour to appear as his friend which he must at least think second to that of succeeding  I hear you are commenced chaplain since I saw you I wish you joy of it The chaplain's title is infinitely more agreeable than his office  and I hope the scarf which is expressive of it will be no diminutive thing no fourpennyhalf∣penny piece of ribboning but that it will  High o'er the neck its rustling folds display  Disdain all usual bounds extend its sway  Usurp the head and push the wig away  I hope it will prove ominous that my first letter is a congratulatory one and if I were to have op∣portunities of sending all such it would entirely quadrate with the sincere wishes of  Your faithful humble servant W SHENSTONE  I beg my compliments to Mr Somervile Mrs Knight and your family  Leasows  Aug  IX To the same  From Mr Wintle's Perfumer at the King's Arms by TempleBar FleetStreet    Sir  I AM heartily obliged to Mr Somervile that he will make use of any means to serve me more especially that he will take the trouble of consulting which may be most effectual to that end and I desire you would represent these sen∣timents to him in the most expressive manner  I have since I arrived here which was last Saturday night heard Lowe sing and seen Cib∣ber act The laureat spoke an epilogue made  upon  and I suppose  by  himself in which he does not only make a bare confession but an  ostentation  of all his follies  Of  such  says he whoe'er demands a bill of fare  May look into my lifehe'll find 'em there  or some such lines I cannot accurately recollect them I do not wonder he pleased extremely but to a considering man there is something strangely disagreeable to hear a scandalous life recommended by one of his age and as much satisfaction shewn in the review of it as if it had been a perfect galaxy of virtues An Athe∣nian audience would have shewn their different sentiments on this occasion But I am acting the part of Jeremy Collier and indeed in some de∣gree of an Hypocrite for I confess I was highly pleased with him myself I have nothing to add but a fine close if I had it as I have not you must be content with the vulgar one that I am  Yours sincerely W SHENSTONE  X To the same  Dear Sir  I THANK you for the favour of your last letter particularly your readiness in trans∣mitting to me any thing of Mr Somervile's It so fell out that Mr Outing delivered to me the verses and I had the pleasure of reading them about a moment before he gave me your epistle  The town expected something of importance namely a motion for a committee of enquiry into late measures would be moved for to day If any thing of this nature has been carried on I will add an account of it before I close my letter In the mean time it is I believe very credible that Lord Orford has a continued in∣fluence over the King and that the Duke of  Argyle is sufficiently disgusted to have talked of the resignation of his posts again  An odd story enough the following and I believe true Somebody that had just learnt that Hor W 's gentleman's name was Jackson writes a letter to Mr Floyer keeper of the Tower intimating his master's desire to speak with him Floyer dresses the next morning and waits upon He comes into his room  "Sir says Horace I really don't know you "  "Sir my name is Floyer"  "Ay by Gd that may be I don't know you for all that"  "Sir says he I am keeper of the Tower"  "Gd damn your blood says He produce your warrantdamn you produce your war∣rant or by Gd I'll kick ye down stairs"  Frighted at these threats the gentleman re∣tired and in his way home had leisure to con∣sider the joke that was put upon him and more particularly turned upon the person to whom he was sent  If you direct a line to Mr Shuckburgh's bookseller in Fleetstreet it will arrive agree∣able to  Your humble servant W SHENSTONE  March Tuesday Night  MY compliments to your patron  XI To the same    SIR  YOUR last letter gave me a good deal of uneasiness in rgard to Mr Somervile's indisposition I hope if he is better you will omit no opportunity of gratifying me with the news of it I shall be glad to employ you and Mr Jago in my little rivulet before winter comes  when one must bid adieu to rural beauties Those charming scenes which the poets in order to render them more compleat have furnished with ladies must be stript of all their ornaments Those incomparable nymphs the Dryads and the Nereids which have been my constant com∣panions this short summer will vanish to more pleasing climes and I must be left to seek my assistance in real beauties instead of imaginary ones In short I am thinking to live part of this winter in Worcester or some other town I was at a concert there a very full one lately I observed Dr Mackenzie talking to Mr Lyt∣tleton and I hope on that account he is in his interest otherwise Mr Somervile would do Mr Lyttleton great service by engaging himMr Lyttleton took occasion to mention to me the obligation he lay under to Mr Somervile for his letter as well as his other designs in his fa∣vourthat he had long received great pleasure from that gentleman's pen and wished for the honour of his acquaintance I told him I be∣lieved the satisfaction would be mutual or to that purpose He added that the Chace was an  extremely  beautiful poem the best by far ever written on the subject But now the fiddles squeaked the harpsichord jingled and the per∣formers began to feel the divine enthusiasm The god of music invaded them as he did the Sibyll of old  Deus ecce Deus cui talia fanti  Ante fores subito non vultus non color unus  Non comptae mansere comae sed pectus an∣helum  Et rabie fera corda tument majorque videri  Nec mortale sonans  I am Sir with all due compliments to Mr Somervile  Yours sincerely W SHENSTONE  XII To Mr JAGO from London with Observa∣tions on the Stage c  Jan  Sir  YOU see I am  extremely expeditious  in an∣swering your letter the reason of which is a very powerful one namely the information which I received last night that it would be agreeable to you I should do so Please there∣fore to set aside the sum of eighteen pence or thereabouts for letters which you will receive whilst I am in London and to make it seem the less profusely squandered consider it amongst any other casual expences which you carelessly submit to merely to gratify your curiosity  I went the other night with the greatest ex∣pectations to see  "The Merry Wives of Wind∣sor"  performed at CoventGarden It is im∣possible to express how much every thing fell below my ideas But I have  considered since  and I find that my expectations were really more unjust than their manner of acting  Persons  in order to act well should have something of the author's fire as well as a polite education And what makes this the clearer to me is that you hear ten plays well read by gentlemen in compa∣ny to one that you find well performed upon the stageNothing can be more ignorant or affected than the scornful airs which some peo∣ple give themselves at a country play because forsooth they have seen plays in town The truth is the chief advantage of plays in town lies entirely in the scenery You seldom observe a set of strollers without one or two actors who are quite equal to their parts and I really know of no good one at either of the two Theatres Royal except Cibber who rarely acts and Mrs Olive I will add one more in  compliance  with my  own  taste  merely  and that is Mr Neal a  fellow who by  playing the fool  has gained my particular  esteem  After the play we had an  entertainment  falsely so called It was that of Orpheus and Eurydice the most  unmusical  thing I ever heard and which lasted I believe three hours with some intermixtures of Harlequin both so dull and yet heard with patience that I was amazed astonished confounded but really a  man  of  sense  ought not to be so because they were not calculated for  him  I want you here extremelypray come up for a week I suppose you will not so I will not argue superfluously However write soon and believe that your letters are the most agree∣able things in the world to Sir  Yours most faithfully W S  XIII To the same    Dear Sir  AS I have no sort of library in town I find several minutes upon my hands for which if I employ them in scribling to my friends they are but  slenderly obliged  to me I hope no friend of mine will ever be induced by my  ex∣ample  to do any thing but avoid it I believe no one breathing can say with more truth  "Video meliora c"  It is not from a spirit of jealousy that I would advise my acquaintance to seek happiness in the regular path of a fixed life But though I very highly approve of it and envy it my particular turn of mind would be as little satisfied with it as it is like to be a  dif∣ferent  one Yet however I  complain  I must  own I have a good deal reconciled myself to this mixture of gratification and disappointment which must be my lot till the last totally pre∣vails  YET after all to tell you the truth I am not pleased with being advised to retire I was say∣ing the other day to Mr Outing that I  had  been ambitious more than I was at present and that I grew less so every day Upon this he chimed in with me and approved my despon∣dency saying  "that  he  also had been ambiti∣ous but found it would not do"  Do you think I lik'd him much for thisnoI wheeled about and said  "I did not think with him for I should always find myself whetted by disap∣pointments and more violent in proportion to the intricacy of the game"  I spent a night with him and Mr Meredith and with him and Mr Dean in the latter party he had laid his hand upon his sword six times and  threatened to put a dozen men to death  one of which was Broughton the prizefighterMr Whistler's company seldom  relieves  me on an evening and I go to plays but  seldom  because I intend no more to  give countenance  to the  pit  I have got a belt which distinguishes me as much as a  garter  it captivates the eyes of all beholders and binds their understanding in golden bandageI heard a pedant punning upon the word  and a wag whispering that I was re∣lated to  Beltishazzar  In short I may say from the Dragon of Wantley  No girdle nor belt e'er excell'd it  It frightens the men in a minute  No maiden yet ever beheld it  But wish'd herself tied to me in it  THE Dunciad is doubtless Mr Pope's do∣tage  slat in the whole and in∣cluding  with severable tolerable lines a  number  of weak obscure and even punning ones What is now read by the  whole world  and the  whole world's wife  is Mr Hervey's Letter to Sir T Hanmer I own my  taste  is gratified in it as well as that  unluckiness  natural to every one though people say I think idly he is mad For this  long  letter I shall expect  two  soon after you have received it Adieu  DID you see a poem called  "Woman in Miniature"  written with spirit but incorrect The people that were carrying Lord Orford in effigy to behead him on Tower Hill came into the box where he was accidentally at George's to beg money of him amongst others  XIV To Mr on his taking Orders in the Church  Leasows  June  Dear Sir  I WRITE to you out of the abundant incli∣nation I have to hear from you imagining that as you gave me a direction you might pos∣sibly expect to receive a previous letter from me I want to be informed of the impressions you receive from your  new  circumstances The chief aversion which some people have to orders is what I fancy you will remove in such as you converse with I take it to be owing partly to dress and partly to the  avowed profession  of reli∣gion A young clergyman that has distinguish∣ed his genius by a composition or two of a polite nature and is capable of dressing  himself  and his  religion  in a different manner from the ge∣nerality of his profession that is without for∣mality is certainly a genteel character I speak this not with any sly design to advise but to in∣timate that I think you very capable of  shining  in a darkcoloured coatYou must consider me yet as a man of the world and endeavouring to elicit that pleasure from gaiety which my reason tells me I shall never findIt is impossible to express how stupid I have been ever since I came home insomuch that I cannot write a common letter without six repetitions This is the third time I have begun yours and you see what stuff it is made up of I must e'en hasten to matter of fact which is the comfortable re∣source of dull peoplethough even as to that I have nothing to  communicate  But I would be glad to know whether you are under a ne∣cessity of residing on weekdays and if not why I may not expect you a day or two at the Leasows very soonDid you make any enquiry concerning the number of my poems sold at Ox∣ford or did you hear any thing concerning it that concerns me to hearWill S for that is his true name is the excess of simplicity and goodnature He seems to have all the industry imaginable to divert and amuse people without any ambitious ends to serve or almost any con∣cern whether he has so much as a laugh allowed to his stories any farther than as a laugh is an indication that people are delighted This joined with his turn of thought renders him quite agreeable I wish it were in my power to conciliate acquaintance with half his casePray do not delay writing to me Adieu  W SHENSTONE  XV To Mr GRAVES on similar Taste and Manners  The Leasows  Sept  Dear Sir  I WAS very agreeably entertained by your last letter as indeed I am by every one of yours It were affectation to except a paragraph or two on account of partiality where to say the truth the partiality itself pleases oneThis I am very positive of that to have a friend of your temper and taste will always give me pleasure whether I please the world or no but to please ever so much without some such friendship would in all probability signify but little I shall therefore value any means that tend to confirm my opinion of your esteem for me pre∣ferably to any that shew me I am merely deserving of it After all though a very limited number of  friends  may be sufficient an idle person should have a large  acquaintance  and I believe I have the least of any one that ever rambled about so much as I have done I do not know how it is but I absolutely despair of ever being introduced into the world It may be objected by some but you will not object it that I may be acquainted with a sufficient number of people that are my  equals  if I  will  They may be my  equals  and  supe∣riors  whom they mean for aught I care but their conversation gives me no more pleasure than the  canking  of a goose or the quacking of a duck in affluent circumstances Rather  less  indeed of the two because the idea of the sat goose flatters one's appetite but the  human goose  is neither fit to be heard nor eaten I wish in∣deed to be  shewn into  good company but if I can at all distinguish the nature of my inclina∣tions it is more in hopes of meeting with a re∣fined conversation than any thing else I do not at all insist that my genius is  better  than that  of my vociferous neighbours if it be  different  it is a sufficient reason why I should seek such companions as suit it and whether they are found in high or low life is little to the pur∣pose But you will perhaps discern the opera∣tions of  vanity  in all my endeavours I will not disagree with you provided you will allow  amusement  an equal share in them It is the va∣nity to be intimate with men of distinguished sense not of distinguished fortune And this is a vanity which you should not disapprove be∣cause it will bind me a lasting friend to you and your family  I have been over at Shiffnall and in order to make myself agreeable rode a hunting with Mr Pitt I confess I was somewhat diverted and my horse was so much an enthusiast as to be very near running headlong into a deep wa∣ter I believe if I were to turn sportsman I should soon break my neck for fear the hunts∣man should despise me  I will certainly endeavour to see you at Bir∣mingham but beg you would write me a long letter in the mean time and contrive if you can to make it look like a packet as your last did for the sight thereof is exceedingly com∣fortable  Though my wishes will not suffer me to believe that your eyes are in the danger you represent yet supposing them to be only very weak I would recommend some musical instrument that is most agreeable to you I have often looked upon music as my dernier resort if I should ever dis∣card the world and turn eremite entirely Con∣sider what other amusement can make an equal impression in old age  I have filled my paper not without difficulty through the barrenness of my brain and situa∣tion my heart ever slows with the most warm streams of gratitude and affection for you Adieu  W SHENSTONE  XVI To a Friend expressing his Dissatisfaction at the Manner of Life in which he is engaged    Dear Sir  I WONDER I have not heard  from  you lately  of  you indeed I have from Mr W If you could come over probably I might go back with you for a day or two for my horse I think gets rather better and may with indul∣gence perform such a journey I want to advise with you about several mattersto have your opinion about a  building  that I  have built  and about a journey which I design to Bath and about numberless things which as they are num∣berless cannot be comprehended in this paper I am  Your most affectionate friend W SHENSTONE  Now I am come home from a visitevery little uneasiness is sufficient to introduce my whole train of melancholy considerations and to make me utterly dissatisfied with the life I now lead and the life which I foresee I shall lead I am angry and envious and dejected and fran∣tic and disregard all present things just as be∣comes a madman to do I am infinitely pleased though it is a gloomy joy with the application of Dr Swift's complaint  "that he is forced to die in a rage like a poisoned rat in a hole"  My soul is no more suited to the figure I make than a cable rope to a cambrick needleI can∣not bear to see the advantages alienated which I think I could deserve and relish so much more than those that have themNothing can give me patience but the soothing sympathy of a friend and  that  will only turn my rage into sim∣ple  melancholyI believe soon I shall bear to see nobody I do hate all hereabouts already except one or two I will have my  dinner  brought upon my table in my absence and the plates fetched away in my absence and no∣body shall see me for I can never bear to ap∣pear in the same stupid mediocrity for years to∣gether and gain no ground As Mr G com∣plained to me and I think you too both un∣justly  "I am no character"  I have in my temper some rakishness but it is checked by want of spirits some solidity but it is softened by vanity some esteem of learning but it is broke in upon by laziness imagination and want of memory cI could reckon up twenty things throughout my whole circumstances wherein I am thus tantalized Your fancy will present themNot that all I say here will signify to  you  I am only under a fit of dissatisfaction and to grumble does me goodonly excuse me that I cure myself at your expence Adieu  XVII To the same    Dear Sir  YOU must give me leave to complain of your last letter three parts of which is filled with mere apology I thought we had some time agreed for our mutual emolument to lay aside ceremonies of this species till I was made Poetlaureat and you Bishop of Winches∣terWhy Bishop of Winchester for God's sake Whybecausehe is prelate of the Garteran order in all kinds of ceremony so greatly aboundingHere am I still trifling away my time my money and I think my health which I fancy greatly inferior to what it it would be in the country Truth is I do make shift to vary my days a little here and  calling to mind the many irksome hours the stupid identity of which I have been so often sick in the country I conclude that I am less  un∣happy  than I shall find myself at homeHowe∣ver next month I hope to see the Leasows with an appetiteWalks in the park are now de∣lightfully pleasant the company stays in the Mall till ten every nightMrs Olive Mrs Wof∣fington Barbarini and Mr Garrick happy man are gone over to Ireland to act there for two monthsMr Outing the last time I saw him told me how Dr Mackenzie cured him of ever fighting with scrubs  "I was just going says he to kick a fellow down stairs when the Doctor cries out 'Mr Outing hear our Scotch pro∣verb before you proceed any fartherHe that wrestles with a td whether he get or lose the victory is sure to be bt' I had great difficulty continued he to contain my∣self till he had finished his story but I found it so pat that it saved the fellow's neck"  I wish  I  could  cure  him as easily of these Quixo∣tical narrationsI know no soul in town that  has  any taste which occasions me the spleen fre∣quently I remember W and I were observing that no creatures though ever so loathsome as toads serpents adders c would be half so hated as ourselves if we were to give vent to our spleen and censure affections so bluntly as some people do I would not venture this hint if I did not believe you experience the same For my part people contradict me in things I have  studied  and am  certain  of and I keep silence even from  good words    bons mots  though it is pain and grief to me I must give up my  knowledge  to  pretence  or vent it with  diffidence  to fools or there is no peace  These these  are  jus∣tifiable  motives to wish for some degree of same that blind people may not bully a man that has his eyesight into their opinion that green is  red c Deference from fools is no  inviduous  ambition I dare own to you that I  have  this and I will contend that I have no more  haughty  oneThis subject I could expatiate upon with pleasure but I stop a tasteless fellow has spoil∣ed my Mallwalk tonight and occasioned you some trouble in these dull observationsI am  Yours affectionately W SHENSTONE  XVIII To Mr from the Leasows  The Leasows  June th  Dear Sir  IF a friend of yours who lived in the farthest part of China were to send you a pinch of snuff wrapt up in a sheet of writingpaper I conceive the snuff would improve in value as it travelled and gratify your curiosity extremely by the time it reached your fingers endsVery trueyou will saywhy then  that very consi∣deration  was my inducement to write to you at this time and that sort of progressional value is what you are to place upon my letter For be assured I am not ignorant how much this my letter doth resemble a pinch of snuff in point of significancy and that both the one and the other are what you may as well do withoutMy letter is as follows  You must know in rainy weather I always soothe my melancholy with the remembrance of  distant  friends only you cannot easily conceive the high value I place upon their good qualities at such a time so that at this very instant I am  impatient  to see you Tomorrow if the sun shines bright I shall only  wish  for your  company as for a  very great good  If you are unemployed when you leave Bath I should think you might stay some time with me this summer Refined sense is what one is apt to value one's self upon but really unless one has a refined soul or two to converse with it is an inconvenience I have ruined my happiness by conversing with you and a few more friends as Falstaff says to Hal  "Company  witty  com∣pany has been the ruin of me"  Before I knew that pleasure I was as contented as could be in my solitude and  now  the  absence  of  enter∣tainment  is a  positive  pain to me London has amused me a while with diversions but now they are past and I have neither any one about me that  has  the least  delicatesse  or that I can in∣spire with the  ambition of having any  W W comes in a dirty  shirt  and an old coat without a stock to pay me a visit He pulled out a pair of scissars and giving them an intricate turn over his two thumbs said that  he  could do that and  I  could make a poem some for  one  thing some for another  Hic nigri succos loliginis haec est  Aerugo mera  It was  splenetic  weather  too  The man is curst who writes verses and lives in the countryIf his  celestial  part inspires him to converse with Juno his  terestrial  one necessitates him to to stoop to his landlady so that he is in as disagreeable a situation as if one person were to pull him upwards by the  head  and another downwards by the  tail  Do you never find any thing of thisI mean that your  pride  and your  social  qualities torture you with their  dif∣ferent  attractions Indeed one would always give way to the last but that few are famili∣arityproof few but whom it teaches to despise one Albeit I am conscious of the bad influ∣ence  of freedom myself yet whilst it tends to discover wit humour and sense it only ren∣ders me more and more  Your most obedient friend and servant W SHENSTONE  XIX To the same with an invitation to accompany him to Town  The Leasows  Nov  Dear Sir  THE reason why I write to you so sud∣denly is that I have a proposal to make to you If you could contrive to be in London for about a month from the end of December I imagine you would spend it agreeably enough along with me Mr Outing and Mr Whistler According to my calculations we should be a vely happy party at a play coffeehouse or tavernDo not let your supercilious friends come in upon you with then prudential maximsConsider you are now of the proper age for pleasure and have not above four or five whimsical years left You have not struck one bold stroke yet that I know of Saddle your mule and let us be jogging to the great city I will be answerable for amusementLet me have the pleasure of seeing you in the pit in a laughter as cordial and singular as your friendship Comelet us go forth into the operahouse let us hear how the cunuchfolk sing Turn your eyes upon the lilies and roses diamonds and rubies the Belindas and the Sylvias of gay life Think upon Mrs Olive's  inexpressible comicalness not to mention Hip∣pesley's jokeabounding physiognomy Think I say  now  for the time cometh when you shall say  "I have no pleasure in them"  I am conscious of much merit in bringing about the interview betwixt Mr L and Mr S but merit as Sir John Falstaff says is not regarded in these costermonger days  Pray now do not write me word that your  business  will not allow you  ten minutes  in a fort∣night to write to me an excuse fit for none but a cobler who has ten children dependent upon a waxen thread Adieu  W S  XX To the same on occasion of printing the SCHOOLMISTRESS    Dear Sir  I TRUST you do not pay double postage for my levity in inclosing these decorations If I find you do I will not send you the  thatch'd∣house  and the birchtree with the sun setting and gilding the sceneI expect a cargo of franks and then for the beautiful picture of Lady Gainsborough and the deformed portrait of my old schooldame Sarah Lloyd whose house is to be seen as thou travellest towards the native home of thy faithful servantBut she sleeps with her fathers and is buried with her fathers andThomas her son  reigneth  in her steadI have the first sheet to correct upon the table I have laid aside the thoughts of same a good deal in this  unpromising  scheme and fix them upon the landskip which is engrav∣ing  the red letter which I purpose and the fruit piece which you see being the most seemly ornaments of the first sixpenny pamphlet that was ever so highly honoured I shall incur the same reflection with Ogilby of having nothing good but my decorations  I have been walking in the Mall tonightThe  Duke  was there and was highly delighted with two dogs and stared at me more enor∣mously than ever Duke did before I do not know for what reason unless for the same which made him admire the  other  puppydogs because they were large ones  I expect that in your neighbourhood and in Warwickshire there should be about twenty of my poems sold I print it myself I am not yet satisfied about mottoes That printed is this  "O quà sol habitabiles illustrat oras maxime principum"  It must be short on account of the plate I do not know but I may adhere to a very insignificant one  En erit ergo  Ille dies mihi cum liceat  tua  dicere facta  I am pleased with Mynde's engravings and I can speak without affectation that Fame is not  equally  in my thoughtsOne caution I gave Mr W and it is what I would give to all my friends with whom I wish my intimacy may continue so much as I wish it may with you Though I could bear the  disregard  of the town I could not bear to see my friends alter their opinion which they say they have of what I write though millions contradict them It is an obstinacy which  I  can boast of and they that have more sense may surely insist on the liberty of judging for themselves If  you  should faul∣ter I should say you did not deserve your  capa∣city  to judge for yourself Write soonyou never are at a fault  "tantummodo  incepto  opus est caetera res expediet"  Adieu  W S  XXI To the same from Town on the Death of Mr Somervile c    My good friend  OUR old friend Somervile is dead I did not imagine I could have been so sorry as I find myself on this occasion  "Sublatum quaerimus"  I can now excuse all his foibles impute them to age and to distress of circum∣stances the last of these considerations wrings my very soul to think on For a man of high spirit conscious of having at least in one pro∣duction generally pleased the world to be plagued and threatened by wretches that are low in every sense to be forced to drink him∣self into pains of the body in order to get rid of the pains of the mind is a misery which I can well conceive because I may without va∣nity esteem myself his equal in point of oeco∣nomy and consequently  ought  to have an eye on his misfortunes As you kindly hinted to me at twelve o'clock at the Feathers I should retrenchI will but you shall not see meI will not let you know that I took your hint in good part I will do it at solitary times as I may and yet there will be some difficulty in it for whatever the  world  might esteem in poor Somervile I really find upon critical en∣quiry that  I  loved him for nothing so much as his floccinaucinihilipili fication of money  Mr A was honourably acquitted Lord A who was present and behaved very in∣solently  they say was hissed out of court They proved his application to the carpenter's son to get him to swear against Mr A though the boy was proved to have said in several compa∣nies  before  he had been kept at Lord A's house that he was sure the thing was acciden∣tal Finally it is believed he will recover the title of Aea  The apprehension of the whores and the suffocation of four in the roundhouse by the  stupidity  of the keeper engrosses the talk of the town The said house is rebuilding every day for the mob on Sunday night demolished it and redemolished every night The Duke of M gh J S his brother Lord C G were taken into the roundhouse and confined from eleven at night till eleven next day I am not positive of the Duke of Mgh the others are certain and that a large number of people of the first fashion went from the roundhouse to De Veil's to give in informations of their usage The justice himself seems greatly scared the prosecution will be carried on with violence so as probably to hang the keeper and there is an end  Lord Bath's coachman got drunk and tumbled from his box and he was forced to borrow Lord Orford's Wits say that it was but gra∣titude for my Lord Orford's  coachman  to drive my Lord Bath as my Lord Bath  himself  had driven my Lord Orford Thus they  I have ten million of things to tell you tho' they all amount to no more than that I wish to please you and that I am  Your sincere friend and humble servant  I am pleased that I can say I knew Mr So∣mervile which I am to thank you for  XXII To Mr Graves on Benevolence and Friendship  The Leasows  Jan  Dear Mr Graves  I CANNOT forbear immediately writing to you the pleasure your last letter gave me puts it out of my power to restrain the over∣flowings of my benevolence I can easily con∣ceive that upon some extraordinary instances of friendship my heart might be  si sort attendri  that I could not bear any restraint upon my ability to shew my gratitude It is an observa∣tion I made upon reading to day's paper which contains an account of C Khevenhuller's suc∣cess in favour of the Queen of Hungary To think what sublime affection must influence that poor unfortunate Queen should a faithful and zealous General revenge her upon her enemies and restore her ruined affairs  Had a person shewn an esteem and affection for  me  joined with any elegance or without any elegance in the expression of it I should have been in acute pain till I had given some sign of my willingness to serve himFrom  all  this I conclude that I have more humanity than some others  Probably enough I shall never meet with a larger share of happiness than I feel at present If not I am thoroughly convinced my pain is greatly superior to my pleasure That pleasure is not absolutely dependent on the mind I know from this that I have enjoyed happier scenes in the company of some friends than I can possibly at presentbut alas all the time you and I shall enjoy together abstracted from the rest of our lives and lumped will not perhaps amount to a solid year and a half How small a proportion  People will say to one that talks thus  "Would you die"  To set the case upon a right footing they must take away the hopes of greater happiness in  this  life the feares of great∣er misery hereafter together with the bodily  pain  of dying and address me in a disposition betwixt mirth and melancholy and I could easily resolve them  I do not know how I am launched out so far into this complaint it is perhaps a strain of constitutional whining the effect of the winddid it come from the winds to the winds will I deliver it  Tradam protervis in mare Creticum  Portare ventis  I will be as happy as my fortune will permit and make others so  Pone me pigris ubi  nulla campis  Arbor  aestiva recreatur aura  I will be so The joke is that the descrip∣tion which you gave of that country was that you had few trees about you so that I should  trick  fortune if she should grant my petition im∣plicitly But in earnest I intend to come and stay a day or two with you next summer  Mr Whistler is at Mr Gosling's bookseller at the Mitre and Crown in Fleetstreet and en∣quired much after you in his last letter to me He writes to me but I believe his affection for one weighs less with him while the town is in the other scale Though he is very obliging I do not know whether I do right when I say I believe we three that is in solitary circum∣stances have an equal idea of and affection for each other I say supposing each to be alone or in the country which is nearly the same for scenes alter minds as much as the air influ∣ences bodies For instance when Mr Whistler  is in town I suppose we love him better than he does us and when we are in town I sup∣pose the same may be said in regard to him  The true burlesque of Spenser whose cha∣racteristic is simplicity seems to consist in a  simple  representation of such things as one laughs to  see  or to  observe  one's self rather than in any  monstrous  contrast between the thoughts and words I cannot help thinking that my added stanzas have more of his manner than what you saw before which you are not a judge of till you have read him  W S  XXIII To the same with some Observations on SPENCER  Leasows  The Day before Christmas  Dear Sir  THOUGH your last letter seemed to put my correspondence upon an ostentatious footing namely an inclination to be witty yet I assure you it was not any punctilious conside∣ration of that kind that has kept me so long silent Indeed with some people one would stand upon the nicest punctilios for though ceremony be altogether lighter than vanity itself yet it surely weighs as much as the acquaintance of the un∣deserving But this is trifling because it can have no reference to a person for whom I have the greatest affection  In regard to my Oxford affairs you did all I could expect I have wrote since to Mr M who either for your sake or mine will I dare say settle them to my satisfaction  I wish your journey and headach would have permitted you to have been a little more parti∣cular concerning the seat of the Muses but I suppose nothing material distinguished your fortnight  Mr Whistler has relapsed at Whitchurch but purposed when I last heard from him to go to London before this time I do not en∣tirely understand his schemes but should have been sincerely glad of his company with me this winter and he says he is not fond of LondonFor my part I designed to go thither the next month but the fever which is chiefly violent in towns discourages me  Some time ago I read Spenser's Fairy Queen and when I had finished thought it a proper time to make some additions and corrections in my trifling imitation of him the Schoolmistress His subject is certainly bad and his action in∣expressibly confused but there are some parti∣culars in him that charm one Those which afford the greatest scope for a ludicrous imita∣tion are his simplicity and obsolete phrase and yet these are what give one a very singular plea∣sure in the perusal The burlesque which they occasion is of quite a different kind to that of Philips's Shilling Cotton's Travestie Hudibras or Swift's works but I need not tell  you  this I inclose a copy for your amusement and opi∣nion which if franks are plentiful you may return and save me the  tedious  trouble of writ∣ing it over again The other paper was  bona fide  written to divert my thoughts from pain for the same reason that I smoaked actions equally reputable  Mr Somervile's poem upon hawking called  "Field Sports"  I suppose is out by this time It was sent to Mr Lyttleton to be read to the Prince to whom it was inscribed It seems he is fond of hawking  I have often thought those to be the most enviable people whom one least enviesI be∣lieve married men are the happiest that are but I cannot say I envy them because they lose all their merit in the eyes of other ladies  I beg sincerely that you would write in a week's time at furthest that I may receive your letter  here  if I should go from home this win∣ter I will never use any thing by way of con∣clusion but your old Roman  Farewel  W SHENSTONE  XXIV To the same with a Continuation of the same Subject  June  Dear Mr Graves  I AM glad the stay you make in Hereford∣shire amuses you even though it puts you upon preferring the place you reside at to my own place of residence I do not know whe∣ther it be from the prejudice of being born at the Leasows or from any real beauty in the situa∣tion but I would wish no other would some one by an addition of two hundred pounds a year put it in my power to exhibit my own designs It is what I can now do in no other method than on paper I live in such an un∣oeconomical manner that I must not indulge myself in the plantation of a tree for the fu∣ture I have glutted myself with the extremity of solitude and must adapt my expences more to sociable life It is on this account that it seems more prudent for me to buy a chair while  I am in town than to carry down twelve gui∣neas for the model of the tomb of Virgil an urn and a scheme or two more of like natureI long to have my picture  distantly  approach∣ing to a profile the best manner I can think of to express myself drawn by Davison I have seen your sister's and think the  face  well done in every respectbut am greatly indignant with other things of a less fixed nature The cap though a good cap enough has a vile effect the formality of stays c not agreeableI do not know if you saw the picture of a Scotch girl there at full length Miss Graves has the advantage of her's or any picture there in her person but certainly this girl's hair is inexpres∣sibly charming There is the genteelest negli∣gence in it I ever saw in any picturewhat follows but that I wish your sister would give orders to pull off her cap and have hair after the manner of this pictureTo speak abruptly as it  is  I disapprove it were it altered I should like it beyond any I ever sawI am glad you are reading Spenser though his plan is detes∣table and his  invention  less wonderful than most people imagine who do not much consider the obviousness of allegory yet I think a person of your disposition must take great delight in his  simplicity  his goodnature c Did you observe a stanza that begins a canto somewhere  Nought is there under heav'n's wide hollowness  That breeds c  When I bought him first I read a page or two of the Fairy Queen and cared not to pro∣ceed After that Pope's Alley made me con∣sider him ludicrously and in that light I think one may read him with pleasure I am now as Chmley with from trifling and laughing at him really in love with him I think even  the metre pretty though I shall never use it in earnest and that the last Alexandrine has an extreme majestyDoes not this line strike you I do not justly remember what canto it is in  Brave thoughts and noble deeds did  evermore  inspire  Perhaps it is my fancy only that is enchanted with the running of it Adieu  W S  XXV To the same on the Publication of the Schoolmistress  Dear Mr Graves  I DEPENDED a good deal on an immediate answer from you and am greatly fearful you never received a packet of little things which I sent you to Oxford inclosed in a frank tho' if arrived at all it must have arrived several days before you left it I beseech you to send me a line upon the receipt of these which will free me from much perplexity though it is doubtful whether I can defer my schemes so as to make your criticisms of service I would have you send them notwithstanding  I cannot help considering myself as a sports∣man though God knows how poor a one in every sense and the company as my game They  fly up  for a little time and then  settle  again My cue is to discharge my  piece  when I observe a number together This week they are straggling round about their pasture the town the next they will flock into it with violent appetites and then discharge my little piece amongst themI assure you I shall be very easy about the acquisition of any same by this  thing all I much wish is to lose none and indeed I have so little to lose that this conside∣ration scarcely affects me  I dare say it must be very incorrect for I have added eight or ten stanzas within this fortnight But inaccuracy is more excusable in ludicrous poetry than in any other If it strikes  any  it must be merely people of  taste  for peo∣ple of  wit  without taste which comprehends the larger part of the critical tribe will una∣voidably despise it I have been at some pains to secure myself from A Philips's misfortune of mere  childishness  "little charm of placid mien c"  I have added a ludicrous index purely to shew fools that I am in jestand my motto  "O quà sol habitabiles illustrat oras maxime principum"  is calculated for the same purpose You cannot conceive how large the number is of those that mistake burlesque for the very foolish∣ness it exposes which observation I made once at the Rehearsal at Tom Thumb at Chronon∣hotonthologos all which are pieces of elegant humour I have some mind to pursue this caution further and advertise it  "The Schoolmistress c"  A very  childish  performance every body knows  novorum more  But if a per∣son seriously calls this or rather burlesque a childish or low species of poetry he says wrong For the most regular and formal poetry may be called trifling folly and weakness in compa∣rison of what is written with a more  manly  spirit in ridicule of itI have been plagued to death about the ill execution of my designsNothing is certain in London but expence which I can ill bear Believe me  till death  Yours sincerely and particularly W SHENSTONE  XXVI To the same with a humourous Description of his Conduct in regard to Form and Equipage  The Leasows  Nov  Dear Sir  PRESUMING you may be at Tissington by this time I write to solicit a description of the several adventures accidents and phae∣nomena that have amused you in your travels and will  equally  affect me as they relate to you Above all things be particular in regard to your calculations respecting Mickleton I would have certainly met you there as you desired me there is no company I am fonder of than yours and your sisters and no place at which I have spent more agreeable hours than Mickleton But your brother has lost one of his recom∣mendations in my eye that is his  irregularity  of housekeeping He has several left which are sufficient to preserve my utmost esteem but that was a jewel indeed I love to go where there is nothing much more in form than my∣self I have no objection to visit  young unsettled people  with a mountebank's inconsistency in my equipage But where a considerable family keeps up its forms as marriage requires I should not care to appear with an hired horse and a  Sancho  for my valet The case is I  could  live in a way genteel enough and uniformly so but then I must forego megrims whims toys and so forth Now though it gives me pain  sometimes  not to appear of a piece yet that  infrequent  pain is not a balance for the substan∣tial happiness which I find in an urn a seal a snuffbox an engraving or a bust Ambition too as it puts me upon wishing to make a figure makes me very indifferent as to making a com∣mon everydaygentlemanly figure and saves me from appearing solicitous about the  "res  mediocriter  splendidae"  by raising my imagina∣tion  higher  I pour out my vanity to you in ca∣taracts but I hope you will rather consider it as a mark of my  confidence  and consequently my sincere esteem and affection for I take it the former seldom subsists without the latter And as to what I said about my love of flattery I hope you will not construe it as any  hint  nei∣ther if I am right would you be so ungenerous as not to comply with me I sincerely think that flattery amongst foes is absolutely desirable amongst one's  common acquaintance  a behaviour  rather inclining  to it but amongst  friends  its consequences are of too dangerous a nature  I am so unhappy in my wintery unvisited state that I can almost say with Dido  "taedet coeli convexa tueri"  I am miserable to think that I have not thought enough to amuse me I walk a day together and have no idea but what comes in at my eyes I long for some sub∣ject about the size of Philips's Cyder to settle heartily about something that I could enrich by episodes drawn from the English history  Stone∣henge  has some of the advantages I like but seems a dead lifeless title If you chance to think of a subject which you do not chuse to  adorn  yourself send it me to  write upon  I shall be vastly desirous to see you here in spring and am in hopes Whistler will stay a month with me I have sent an imperious let∣ter about his dilatory correspondence He men∣tioned you in his last letter was going to Ox∣ford thence to London where if he stays till February I may see him I hope you will write the very next post you cannot oblige me or please me more than by so doing if you think I deserve to be pleased or am worth ob∣liging Adieu  W S  XXVII To the same from Town with a Speci∣men of Plays and Politics  From Mr Shuckburgh's Bookseller in Fleetstreet your Brother's Lodgings  about  Dear Mr Graves  I HAVE just been spending my evening at a coffeehouse and notwithstanding the con∣fused effect of liquor am sitting down to write to a person of the clearest head I know The  truth  is I write to please  myself  which I can do no other way so effectually upon which ac∣count you are not obliged to me for the  ad∣vances  I make in correspondence Extraordi∣nary things will be expected from my  situation  but extraordinary things ought never to be ex∣pected from  me  I keep no political company nor  desire  any as I believe you know If you enquire after the stageI have not seen Garrick but more fortunately for  you  your brother  has  Me nothing has so much transported as young Cibber's  exhibition  of Parolles in Shakespeare's  "  All's well that ends well  "  The character is admirably written by the author and I fancy I can discover a great number of hints which it has afforded to Congreve in his Bluff I am apt to think a person after he is twelve years old laughs annually less and less less heartily however which is much the same I think Cibber elicited from me as sincere a laugh as I can ever recollect Nothing sure can be com∣parable to his representation of Parolles in his bullycharacter except the figure he makes as a shabby gentleman In his first dress he is taw∣dry as you may imagine in the last he wears a rusty black coat a black stock a black wig  with a Ramillie a pair of black gloves and a facewhich causes five minutes laughterInstead of politics I have transcribed these epi∣grams from the Evening Postthough I hate transcribing  The CHOICE to Sir ROBERT  WHEN opposition against power prevail'd  When artful eloquence and bribery fail'd  Timely you quit the ship you could not steer  Disdain the commons and ascend a peer  Conscious that you deserve to  bleed  or  swing  You chuse the axe as nobler than the string  The OPPOSITION  WITH huge Anteus as Alcides strove  The son of Neptune one and one of Jove  Oft as he threw the giant on the ground  His strength redoubled by the fall he found  Th' unweildy monster sprung of mother Earth  From  her  had vigour as from her he'd birth  Enrag'd the hero a new method tries  High lifts in air and as he mounts he dies  I think the last a good thought the first not a bad one and what I have had in my head a thousand times I saw Mr Fitzherbert at Nan∣do's but chose not to reconnoitre him there though to ask after  you  I purpose waiting on him at his lodgings for the same end Pray write soon to me I wish I could say more to deserve it from youI would fain deviate from the common road in every letter I send you but am so very uniformly your friend that I cannot vary my manner of expressing how  much  I am so which is all my letters aim at Adieu  W SHENSTONE  XXVIII To the same with various Schemes of Composition  Feb  Dear Mr Graves  YOU say it is no way unpleasing to you to receive my letters if you say the thing that is not the fault like others produces its own punishmentYou are now my only cor∣respondent I do not know what reason Whistler has for not caring to write unless he thinks that we ought not to trouble ourselves about one another but bend our whole endeavours to mend our fortunes though I do not  know  his imaginations I was afraid after what I had said concerning  sameness  in my last that you would interpret it to your own disadvantage but was too lazy to write my letter again trust∣ing that I could deny the extent of my com∣plaint to any one besides myself in some future letter There is as much variety in your genius as fortune can introduce into your circumstances  Some time next week do I purpose to set out for London The reasons for my going at all do  barely  preponderate I cannot  conscienti∣ously  print any thing I have two or three little matters in hand none that I am greatly fond of much less that are at all mature One is what you have seen though in its mortal state  "Flattery or the fatal Exotic"  so very quotidian and copious a subject that I dislike it entirely Another  "Elegies in Hammond's Metre"  but upon  real  and natural subjects this I have objections to A third  "An Essay on Reserve"  the subject genteel I think but scarce ten lines finished A fourth  "An Essay in blank Verse on Oeconomy with Advice to Poets on that Head concluding with a ludi∣crous Description of a Poet's Apartment"  I  think it were better to  annex  that poem thus to prevent its clashing like an earthen pot against Philips's silver vase though his humour lies chiefly in the language My favourite scheme is a poem in blank verse upon Rural  Elegance  including cascades temples grottos hermitages greenhouses which introduces my favorite epi∣sode of the Spanish lady you will wonder  how  but I think  well  to close the first book The next running upon planting c will end with a vista terminated by an old abbey which intro∣duces an episode concerning the effects of Ro∣mish power interdicts  c  in imitation of Lu∣cretius's  "Plague of Athens"  t  ken from Thu∣cydides Virgil's Murrain and Ovid's Pestilence c The two episodes in great forwardnessbut alas I do not like formal didactic poetry and shall never be able to finish aught  but  the episodes I doubt unless I allow myself to treat the rest in  my own  manner transientlyas Camilla skimmed over the wheatstubble  I have altered this ballad you see I doubt not to your mind but send your criticisms and I will be all obedience From London I will send you mine on your more important poem your critique will be important upon my silly affair mine silly I am afraid upon your mo∣mentous onebut you do not think it momen∣tous as you ought Direct to Nando's I am  Your most sincere and affectionate friend and humble servant W S  I question whether I should be more unhappy in any mere  mechanical  employment for instance making nails which seems to deal as much in  repetition  as any trade than I am in great part of  my time when my head is unfit for studyMy neighbour is gone to London and has left me a legacy of franks so I shall be able to return your poem c at least by parcels I strenuously purpose to be there or to set out next week but as I  am  here at present I think you ought to pay some deference to the  vis inertiae  at least to the centripetal force of matter and direct to the Leasows one more letter with your opinion concerning the various readings in the trifle I inclose writing the first post that you well canOnce more adieu  Feb  XXIX To the same    Dear Mr Graves  DR Swift would not have scrupled to print your parody with his name to it Why should you  without  your name I had a violent inclination to print it in a large folio four leaves price fourpence but I dare not do it for fear you should think it of evil importance with regard to the clergy You excel me infi∣nitely in a way in which I take most pleasure odd picturesque description Send me word whether I shall print it or noand that right soonI have lingered in town till now and did not receive your letter till this morningI do not know whether I shall send you with this letter a little thing which I wrote in an after∣noon and with proper  demands  of being con∣cealed as the author sold for two guineasNext time I am in town I will get money like a haberdasher I will amuse myself with find∣ing out the people's weak side and so furnish them with  suitable nonsense  I would have you  do the sameMake your wit bear your charges Indeed as to the little parody you send it would fix your reputation with men of sense as much as greatly more than the whole tedious character of Parson Adams I read it half a year ago the week after I came to town but made Mr Shuckburgh take it again imagining it alto∣gether a very mean performanceI liked a tenth part pretty well but as Dryden says of Horace unjustly he shews his teeth without laughing the greater part is  unnatural  and  unhumourous  It has some advocates but I observe those not such as I ever esteemed tasters Finally what makes  you endeavour  to like it  My printer was preparing his bill for the Schoolmistress when I stopped him short with a hint to go to Dodsley who has not yet reckon∣ed with me for Hercules Let  the dead  bury their  dead  Dr Young's Complaint is the best thing that has come out this season these  twenty years  Pope says except mine for so  thinks  every author who does think proper to say so poor Pope's history in Cibber's Letter and the print of him upon the Mount of Love the  coarsest  is most  humorous  must surely mortify him Your sister does me great honour to think my hint any thing but I am quite zealous in my appro∣bation of that Scotch lady's hair I will  ever  aim at  oddness  for the future it is cheaper to follow taste than fashion and whoever he be that devotes himself to  taste  will be  odd  of courseYou send me the verses on Lord Hay they were hacked about town three months ago and I saw them The town is certainly the scene for a man of curiosityI do not purpose to be long away but I must think of retrenchingI have ten thousand things to tell you but I have not room Such people as  we  should meet as regularly to compare notes as tradesmen do to settle accounts but oftener there is no good  comes of long reckoningsI shall forget halfI think it should be four days in a fortnightit would not doit would make one  mindful  of and consequently more uneasy on account of absence Every one gets posts preferments but myselfNothing but my ambition can set me on a footing with them and make me easy Come then lordly pride c The devil thought with me in Milton  All  is not lost th' unconquerable will  And study never to submit or yield  I have been in new companies but I see no reason to contradict my assertion that I find none I like  equally  with  you  Adieu  W SHENSTONE  XXX To Mr JAGO from London    Dear Friend  I SHALL send you but a very few lines being so much indisposed with a cold that I can scarce tell how to connect a sentence I am just got into lodgings at a goldsmith'sa dange∣rous situation you will say for  me    "Actum est ilicet periisti"  Not sofor of late I have not so violent a taste for toys as I have had and I can look even on snuffboxes  "oculo irretorto"  London is really dangerous at this time the pickpockets formerly content with mere  filching  make no scruple to knock people down with bludgeons in  Fleetstreet  and the  Strand  and that at no later hour than eight o'clock at night but in the Piazza's Coventgarden they come  in large bodies armed with couteaus and attack whole parties so that the danger of coming out of the playhouses is of some weight in the opposite scale when I am disposed to go to them oftener than I oughtThere is a poem of this season called  "The Pleasures of Imagination"  worth your reading but it is an expensive quarto if it comes out in a less size I will bring it home with me Mr Pope as Mr Out∣ing who has been with Lord Bolingbroke in∣forms me is at the point of deathMy Lord Carteret said yesterday in the house  "That the French and Spaniards had actually  said  they would attempt a second invasion"  There is a new play acted at Drury Lane  "Mahomet"  translated from the French of Voltaire but I have no great opinion of the subject or the original author as a poet and my diffidence is rather improved by the testimony of those who have seen itI lodge between the two coffeehouses George's and Nando's so that I partake of the expensiveness of both as heretofore I have no acquaintance in town and but slender inducement to stay and yet probably I shall loiter here for a month  T H was knighted against his will and had a demand made upon him for an hundred pounds before he could get out of St James's so soon are felt the inconveniencics of gran∣deurHe came out of the court in a violent rage  "Gd Jack what dost thinkI am knightedthe devil of a knight e'faith"  I believe he was sincere in his disgust for there had been two bargemasters knighted in his neighbourhood some time before  I saw coming up Lady Fane's grotto which they say cost her five thousand pounds about three times as much as her  house  is worth It is a very beautiful disposition of the finest collec∣tion of shells I ever sawMr Powis's woods  which are finerMean time if I had three hundred pounds to lay out about the Leasows I could bring my ambition to peaceable terms I am dear Sir with all affection yours and Mrs Jago's  W SHENSTONE  Write soon It is this moment reported that Pope is dead  XXXI To the same    Dear Sir  I LONG heartily to talk over affairs with you  téte à téte  but am an utter enemy to the fatigue of transcribing what might pass well enough in conversationI shall say nothing more concerning my departure from L than that it was necessary and therefore excusableI have been since with a gentleman upon the borders of Wales Bishop's Castle from whence I made a digression one day beyond Offa's Dyke saw mountains which converted all that I  had  seen into molehills and houses which changed the Leasows into Hampton Court where they talk of a glazed window as a piece of magnifi∣cence and where their highest idea of his Majesty is that he can ride in such a coach as 'Squire Jones or Squire Pryce's The woman of the inn at one pl  ce "said  "Glass in windows was very genteel that it was but she could not afford such finery"  You agree with the rest of the married world in a propensity to m  ke proselytes This incli∣nation in some people gives one a kind of dread of the matter They are illnatured and can only wish one in their own state because they  are unhappy like persons that have the plague who they say are ever desirous to propagate the infection I make a contrary conclusion when  you  commend marriage as you seem to do when you wish Miss may reconcile me to more than the  name  of wife I know not what you have heard of my amour probably  more  than I can thoroughly confirm to you And what if I should say to you that marriage was not once the subject of our conversation  Nec conjugis unquam  Praetendi taedas aut haec in f  dera veni  Do not you think every thing in nature strangely improved since you were married from the teatable to the  warmingpan  I want to see Mrs Jago's handwriting that I may judge of her temper but she must write something in my praise Pray see you to it in your next letter  I could parodize my Lord Carteret's letter from Dettingen if I had it by me  "Mrs Arnold thanks be praised has this day gained a very considerable victory The scold lasted two hours Mrs Se was posted in the hall and Mrs Arnold upon the staircase which superiority of ground was of no small service to her in the engagement The fire lasted the whole space without intermission at the close of which the enemy was routed and Mrs Arnold kept the field"  Did you hear the song to the tune of  "The Cuckow"  The Baron stood behind a tree  In woeful plight for nought heard he  But Cannon Cannon c  O word of fear  Unpleasing to a German ear  The notes that fall upon the word  "Cannon"  express the sound with its echo admirably  I send you my pastoral elegy or ballad if you think that name more proper on condi∣tion that you return it with ample remarks in your next letter I say  "return it"  because I have no other copy and am too indolent to take one Adieu  W S  XXXII To Mr GRAVES describing his Situation and State of Health c  The Leasows  Dear Mr Graves  TOMORROW morning I set out for Cheltenham to make trial of the waters there I shall perhaps add to this letter at several stages and conclude it at the place to which I am going so that like those springs you may perhaps find it impregnated with the nature of all those places thro' which it passes perhaps quite the contrary  if I mistake not the man is an encou∣rager of works of taste c though I am going to instance this oddly he was a hearty stickler for my poem upon Hercules at Bath as D Jago sent me word Perhaps it was complaisance to Mr Lyttleton with whom Charles c he is intimate if as I said before I do not mistake the person I flatter myself I do not and I hope that we two shall ever find the same per∣sons or the same kind of persons our friends and also our enemies  If I get over this ill habit of body depend upon it I  will  have a  reverend  care of my health as Sir John Falstaff advises the Chief Justice  I solve all the tempests that disturb my constitu∣tion into  wind  it plagues me first in the shape of a bad appetite then indigestion then low∣ness of spirits and a flux of pale water and at night by watchings restlessness twitchings of my nerves or a sleep more distracted than the most active state of watchfulness But I think purging lessens all these symptoms and I trust my scheme that I am entering upon is right  I was on Monday at Hagley to wait on Mr Lyttleton who was gone to Sir John Ast∣ley's to see his grand edificeAs to Mrs Lyt∣tleton if her affability is not artificial I mean if it does not owe its original as it  ought to do  its  management  to art I cannot conceive a per∣son more amiablebut  sense  and  elegance  cannot be seigned to  exhibit  them is to  have  them  How is my song set Miss Carrington pro∣cured it that favour but I have never seen a copy nor knew of its being to be printed Howard has set another of mine which I re∣ceived last post but my harpsichord is out of order and I have found no one yet to explain the hieroglyphicks which convey it You may probably find it in some future number of the British Orpheus  "By the side of a stream c"  I am in as good spirits this instant as ever I was in my life only  "Mens turbidum laetatur"  My head is a little confused but I often think seriously that I ought to have the most ardent and  practical  gratitude as the Methodists chuse to express themselves for the advantages that I have which though not eminently shining are such to speak the truth as suit my particu∣lar humour and consequently deserve all kind of acknowledgment If a poet should address himself to God Almighty with the most earnest thanks for his goodness in allotting him an estate that was overrun with shrubs thickets and coppices variegated with barren rocks and  precipices or floated three parts in four with lakes and marches rather than such an equal and fertile spot as the  "sons of men"  delight in to my apprehension he would be guilty of no absurdityBut of this I have composed a kind of prayer and intend to write a little spe∣culation on the subject this kind of gratitude I assuredly ought to have and have For my health if one reflects a countryfellow's stock of it would be unfit for solitude would dispose one rather to bodily feats and what Falstaff calls in Poins  gambol  faculties than mental contemplations and would give one that kind of pain which springs from  impatience  My con∣stitution was given me originally good and with regard to it now as G Barnwell says  "What am IWhat I  have made myself  "  Or to

at Cheltenham af∣ter an expensive and fatiguing journey I called yesterday at Micklington saw the portico and snapped up a bit of mutton at your brother's drank a dish of tea with Miss S and in op∣position to the strongest remonstrances persisted in an endeavour to reach Cheltenham after five o'clock The consequence was that about ten I found myself travelling back again to∣wards Stowe and had undoubtedly wandered all night in the dark had I not been fortu∣nately met by a waggoner's servant who brought me back to the worst inn but one I ever lay at being his master'sHere I am which is all I shall say in this letter  Adieu  W S  XXXIII To Mr JAGO on the same  The Leasows  Saturday July the th  Dear Mr Jago  IT is not a contrived apology or an excuse which I am going to offer for the disap∣pointments I have given you I have actually been so much out of order ever since I wrote to you nay ever since I  formed a design  of a Sun∣day expedition to L that it never has been in my  power  to execute my intentions My ver∣tigo has not yet taken away my senses God knows how soon it may do but my nerves are  in such a condition that I can scarce get a wink of even  disordered  rest for whole nights together May you never know the misery of such invo∣luntary vigils I ride every day almost to fa∣tigue which only tends to make my want of sleep more  sensible  and not in the least to re∣move it I have  spirits  all day good ones though my head is dizzy and I never enterprize any study of greater subtlety than a newspaper I cannot say the journey to L would be at all  formidable  to me for I ride about fifteen miles as I compute it every day before dinner But the nights from home would be insuppor∣table to me I have fatigued Mrs Arnold's assiduity to the injury of her health by occa∣sioning her to sit in my room a'nights light my candle put it out again make me perspiratory wheys and slops and am amused by the most silly animadversions she is capable of making I never knew her usefulness till now but I  now  prefer her to  all  of  her station  If I get over this disorder concerning which I have bad ap∣prehensions you may depend upon seeing me the first Sunday I dare venture forth I hope  you  continue mending The benefit of  riding  is only not universal and would cure  me  too could I but make one previous advance towards health Have you tried cold bathing Perhaps it may not suit your case I wish I had not dropt it I take my fluctuation of nerves to be caused as that of the sea is by wind which I am continually pumping up and yet find it still renewed When I am just sinking to sleep a sudden twitch of my nerves calls me back againto watchfulness and vexation I consider myself as in the state of the philosopher who held a bullet betwixt his finger and thumb which whenever he was about to nod was ordered so as to fall into a large brass pan and  wake himthat he might pursue his lucubra∣tions  I will mention one circumstance regarding the weakness of my nervesand not my spi∣rits for I told you those were tolerablethe least noise that is even the falling of a fireshovel upon the floor if it happen unexpected∣ly shocks my whole frame and I actually be∣lieve that a gun fired behind my back unawares amidst the stillness of the night would go near to kill me with its noise  I am just going to bed and dare not be any more attentive as I hope to close my eyes for a minute So fare you well  It is now six o'clock in the morning and I have had about five hours middling sleep which encourages me greatly so I will  hope  to be able to see you next Sunday sevennight  What think you of the battle Are not you so much in love with our King that you could find in your heart to serve him in any profita∣ble post he might assign you  Capt L is wounded in the thigh  When I ride in my chair round my neigh∣bourhood I am as much stared and wondered at as a giant would be that should walk through Pallmall My vehicle is at  least as  uncommon hereabouts as a blazing comet My chief plea∣sure lies in finding out a thousand roads and delightful little haunts near home which I ne∣ver dreamt of egregious solitudes and most incomparable byelanes where I can as effec∣tually lose myself within a mile of home as if I were benighted in the desarts of Arabia Adieu  XXXIV To Mr GRAVES written in HayHarvest  July  Dear Mr Graves  I DID not part from you without a  great deal  of melancholy To think of the  short  duration of those interviews which are the ob∣jects of one's  continual  wishes has been a reflec∣tion that has plagued me of old I am sure I returned home with it then more aggravated as I foresaw myself returning to the same series of melancholy hours from which you had a while relieved me and which I had  particularly  suf∣fered under all this last spring I wish to God you might happen to be settled not far from me a day'sjourney distance however I mean an  easy  one But the odds are infinitely against me I must only  rely  for my happiness on the hopes of a neverceasing correspondence  Soon after you were gone I received my packet The history of Worcestershire is mere stuff T I am so fond of that I believe I shall have his part of the collection bound over again neatly and separately But sure Hammond has no right to the least  inventive  merit as the prefacewriter would insinuate I do not think there is a single thought of any eninence that is not literally translated I am astonished he could not content himself with be∣ing so little an original  Mr Lyttleton and his lady are at Hagley A malignant caterpillar has demolished the beauty of all our  large  oaks Mine are secured by their littleness But I guess the park suf¦fers a large wood near me being a mere win∣terpiece for nakedness  At present I give myself up to riding and thoughtlessness being resolved to make trial of  their  efficacy towards a tolerable degree of health  and spirits I wish I had you for my director I should proceed with great confidence of suc∣cess though I am brought very low by two or three fits of a fever since I saw you Had I written to you in the midst of my dispirited condition as I was going you would have had a more tender and unaffected letter than I  can  write at another time what I think perhaps at all times but what sickness can alone elicit from a temper fearful of whining  Surely the  "nunc formosissimus annus"  is to be limited to hayharvest I could give my rea∣sons but you will imagine them to be the acti∣vity of country people in a pleasing employ∣ment the full verdure of the summer the prime of pinks woodbines jasmines c I am old very old for few things give me so much mechanical pleasure as lolling on a bank in the very heat of the sun  When the old come forth to play  On a sunshine holiday  And yet it is as much as I can do to keep Mrs Arnold from going to neighbouring houses in her smock in despite of decency and my known disapprobation  I find myself more of a patriot than I ever thought I was Upon reading the account of the battle I found a very sensible pleasure or as the Methodists term it perceived my heart  enlarged  c The map you sent me is a pretty kind of  toy  but does not enough particularize the scenes of the war c which was the end I had in view when I sent for it  "O dura messorum ilia"  About half the appetite digestion strength spirits c of a mower would make me the happiest of mortals I would be understood literally and precisely  Adieu  W S  XXXV To the same after the Disappointment of a Visit    Dear Sir  I AM tempted to begin my letter as Mem∣mius does his harangue  "Multa medehor∣tantur à vobis ni studium virtutis vestrae om∣nia exsuperet"  You contrive interviews of about a minute's duration and you make ap∣pointments in order to disappoint one and yet at the same time that your proceedings are thus vexatious force one to bear testimony to the inestimable value of your friendship I do in∣sist upon it that you ought to compound for the disappointment you have caused me by a little letter every post you stay in town I shall now scarce see you till next summer or spring at soonest and then I may probably take occa∣sion to visit you under pretence of seeing Der∣byshire Truth is your prints have given me  some  curiosity to see the original places I am grateful for your intentions with regard to giv∣ing me part of them and impertinent in desiring you to convey them to me as soon as you can well spare them Let me know if they are sold separately at the print shops I think to recom∣mend them to my new acquaintance Mr Lyt∣tleton Brown I like the humour of the ballad you mention but am more obliged for your partial opinion of me The notes that fall upon the word  "Cannon Cannon"  are ad∣mirably expressive of the sound I dare say I mean jointly with its echo and so I suppose you will think if you ever attended to the Towerguns I find I cannot afford to go to Bath pre∣viously to my Londonjourney though I look upon it as a proper method to make my resi∣dence in town more agreeable I shall probably  be there about the first of December or before if I can accelerate my friend Whistler's jour∣ney The pen I write with is the most disagree∣able of pens But I have little else to say only thisthat our good friend Jack Dolman is dead at Aldridge his father's benefice  I beg if you have leisure you would inclose me in a frank the following songs with the notes  "Stella and Flavia" "Gentle Jessy" "Sylvia wilt thou waste thy prime"  and any other that is new I should be glad of that number of the British Orpheus which has my song in it if it does not cost above sixpence Make my compliments to your brother and sister and believe me in the common forms but in no common degree  Dear Mr Graves's Most affectionate friend and servant W SHENSTONE  The Leasows  Nov th  Do write out the whole ballad of  "The Baron stood behind a tree"  XXXVI To the same on the Receipt of a Pre∣sent of Prints  The Leasows  Dec  Dear Sir  YOU may reasonably have expected a letter before now either as an acknowledgment for your genteel present or at least by way of information that I had received it The prints have given me a pleasure which however con∣siderable would soon have languished if I had bought them at a shop but which is now built upon the esteem I have for the giver and can∣not have a more durable foundationAs for  the rest I am most pleased with the view of Matlock and shall have no peace of mind till I have seen the original I have been gilding the frames and wishing all the while for your com∣pany  I will alter the ballad according to your ad∣vice dividing it into three parts and adding a stanza or two to the shortest some time or other I have had no opportunity of trying the tunes  "Arno's vale"  has pretty words and recommends itself to one's imagination by the probability that it was written on a real occa∣sion The similitude of rhimes in the close in∣excusable For all that has been the subject of my letter hitherto as the country people say I can but thank you and I do very sincerely though as to the songs I will repay you  I have your poem by me which I have read often with the greatest pleasure I have many observations to make and only defer the com∣munication till I know whether you have a copy at Tissington to turn to I think the most  polite  and  suitable  title to it would run  "The Villa a Poem containing a Sketch of the present Taste in Rural Embellishments written in "  Your preface has a pretty thought to∣wards the close otherwise is on no account to be admitted Pardon my freedom but I think there is no manner of occasion for a pre∣face and those strokes which I  know  to be real modesty in  you  the world will undoubtedly impute to affectationIf you give me encou∣ragement I will be very minute in my criticisms allowing you to reject ten to one that you ad∣mit of  Whistler is gone to Bristol and has bilked meI said he is gone but I believe he is only upon goingI linger at home in hopes of gleaning up a little health and through a dread of being ill in a place where I can be less  attended onI can continually  find out  some∣thing in my preceding diet that I  think  disor∣ders me so that I am constantly in hopes of growing wellbut perhaps I never shall  Optima quaeque dies miseris mortalibus aevi  Prima  fugit subeunt morbi  When I was a schoolboy I never knew there  was any such thing  as perspiration and now half my time is taken up in considering the im∣mediate connexion betwixt that and health and endeavouring to promote it  Mr Lyttelton has built a kind of alcove in his park inscribed  "SEDES CONTEMPLATIO∣NIS"  near his hermitage Under the afore∣said inscription is  "OMNIA VANITAS"  the sides ornamented with sheeps' bones jaws sculls c festoon wise In a nitch over it an owl  As to schemes I have none with regard to the world women or books And I hate and have deferred writing to you for some days for that reason I am sick of exhibiting so much samenessI am constantly poring over some Classic which I consider as one of Idleness's better shapes But I am impatient to be doing something that may tend to better my situation in some respect or other It is  encouragement  can alone inspire one  Multa praeclare minantem  Vivere nec  recte  nec  suaviter    expresses the whole of me Thus my epistles persevere in the plaintive style and I question whether the sight of them does not ere now give you the vapours I have an old aunt that visits me sometimes whose conversation is the perfect counterpart of them She shall fetch a longwinded sigh with Dr Young for a wager  though I see  his  Suspiria are not yet finished He has  relapsed  into  "Night the Fifth"  I take his case to be wind in a great measure and would advise him to take rhubarb in powder with a little nutmeg grated amongst it as I do  Dear Mr G write down to me and believe me to be invariably  Your most sincere and obliged friend c W SHENSTONE  XXXVII To the same with Observations on Hypocrisy c    Dear Sir  YOU must know my last letter to you was written before I received yours from Tis∣sington and I should take shame upon myself for not answering it were I not furnished with this excusethat I waited for a frank for youThere are but few things I have to say to you and such as are not worth transcribing yet as our distance from one another requires it I will scrawl them over as negligently as I can to let you see I lay no stress upon them A good ex∣cuse for laziness you will say and lazy enough I am God knows I believe any one who knows me thoroughly will think that there ne∣ver was so great an inconsistence as there is betwixt my words in my poem and my actionsThis is what the world calls hypocrisy and is determined to look upon with  peculiar  aversion But I think the hypocrite is a  half  good cha∣racter A man certainly considering the force  of precedent deserves some praise who keeps up appearances and is no doubt as much to be commended for talking better than he acts as he is to be blamed for acting worse than he talks So much for casuistry I would seem you must know to have some meritorious views in talking  virtuously  but who does not know that every one who writes poetry looks directly with his face towards praise and whatever else his eye takes in is viewed obliquely Praise as I said to foibleconfessing W is the de∣sired the noted and the adequate reward of poetry in which sort he that rewards me Hea∣ven reward him as Sir John Falstaff saysThere is something very vain in repeating my own sayings but I could not conscientiously use a joke to you which I had used in another letter without owning itIn short it is ne∣cessary to have some  earthly  aim in view the next world whether it be in reality near or far off is always  seen  at a distance All that the generality of young people can do is to act  consistently with  their expectations thereNow though fame c be obviously enough in the eye of reason dissatisfactory yet it is pro∣per enough to suffer one's self to be deluded with the hopes of it that is it is proper to cherish some worldly hopes that one may avoid impatience spleen and one sort of  despair  I mean that of having no  hopes  here because one sees nothing here that deserves them If I were in your case I would make all the efforts I was able towards being a Bishop That should be my earthly aim not but I would act with so much indifference as to bear all disappointment unconcernedlyas I dare say you willThere is but one passion that I put upon an equally sprightly footing with ambition and that is love which as it  regularly tends  to ma∣trimony requires certain favours from fortune  and circumstance to render it proper to indulge inBy this time you think me crazedas it often happens to me to doubt  seriously  whether I am not but if it be the  "mentis gratissimus error"  I do not mind You are very oblig∣ing to endeavour to continue my madness and vanityI should be as glad to see Mr Graves your brother as any one I know I live in a manner wherein he would find many things to exercise his good nature  Pamela would have made one good volume I wonder the author who has some  nice  natu∣ral strokes should not have sense enough to see thatI beg you will collect all the hints c of your own or others that you think may tend to the improvement of my poem against winter that you would mention any flat lines cWrite me word some time ere you come over but write to me immediately I am  Yours faithfully W SHENSTONE  Once more adieu  XXXVIII To a Friend with a Parody  The Leasows  March  Dear Sir  YOU are upon very  good  terms with me and  have  been all along I guessed the causes of your silence and have been sincerely sorry for them not however that I did not believe you were more happy than any one in the world who is neither a lover nor a poet though not able to turn himself for moneybagsI am  really going to London and am about the purchase of an elegant pair of pistols from Bir∣mingham I indulge myself in this expence because they shall serve in two capacities one while to garnish my chair another while my horse And some time next week you will probably see your old friend on horseback armed  at all points  and as very a knight to all  appearance  as any body  Well they say the Owl was a Quaker's Daughterone knows what one IS but one does not know what one SHALL be  Ophelia in Hamlet  But I digress If I just call to see you God forbid that I should be burthensome to you I will send my horses to H and lodge there or somewhere But I am perfectly impatient to unbosom my soul to you and to see Mrs Jago whom I should have mentioned firstWednesday or Tuesday indeed seems he most likely dayThough I am not sure nor do you confine yourself  Poor Mariett  I  too am emaciated but I hope by means of some warm weather to ac∣quire  plus d'embonpoint  I design to call upon him and keep him in countenance  My ballad in the midst of your hurry must appear as ridiculous as Cinna the poet does when he swears nothing but death shall restrain him from addressing Brutus and Cassius and that the night before the battle with two dog∣grel versesand those the worst I have ever read and that makes the simile the more just It is now a good deal metamorposed Your parody is prodigiously droll the first line de∣lights me I think I could furnish Mrs K with as good mottoes and as cheap though I say it as any body but alasDid I send  you the following parody or no before I believe not  Le viola  WHEN first Philander first I came  Where Avon rolls his winding stream  The nymphshow brisk the swainshow gay  To see  Asteria  Queen of May  The parsons round her praises sung  The steeples with her praises rung  I thoughtno sight that e'er was seen  Could match the sight of Barel's Green  But  now  since old  Eugenio  dy'd  The chief of poets and the pride  Now meaner bards in vain aspire  To raise their voice to tune their lyre  Their lovely season now is o'er  Thy notes Florelio please no more  No more Asteria's smiles are seen  Adieuthe sweets of Barel's Green  It is a kind of extempore so excuse itYou have seen the song of Arno's Vale  I am taking part of my farm upon my hands to see if I can succeed as a farmerbut I am afraid I am under the sentence  "And behold whatsoever he taketh in hand it shall  not  prosper"  My good friend I sincerely confide that however we may be separated no time shall extenuate our mutual friendship I am  Your zealous unserviceable friend W SHENSTONE  XXXIX To Mr GRAVES on Social Happiness  About  Dear Mr Graves  THERE is not a syllable you tell me con∣cerning yourself in your last letter but what applied to  me  is most literally true I am sensible of the daily progress I make towards in significancy and it will not be many years before you see me arrived at the  ne plus ultra  I believe it is absolutely impossible for me to ac∣quire a considerable degree of knowledge tho' I can understand things well enough at the time I read them I remember a preacher at St Ma∣ry's I think it was Mr E made a notable distinction betwixt  apprehension  and  comprehension  If there be a real difference probably it may find a place in the explication of my genius I envy you a good  general  insight into the writings of the learned I must aim at nothing higher than a well concealed ignoranceI was think∣ing upon reading your letter  when  it was that you and Mr Whistler and I went out of the road of happiness It certainly was where we first deviated from the turnpike road of lifeWives children alliances visits c are ne∣cessary objects of our social passions and whe∣ther or no we can through particular circum∣stances be happy  with  I think it plain enough that it is not possible to be happy  without  them All attachments to inanimate beauties to curio∣sities and ornaments satiate us presentlyThe fanciful tribe has the disadvantage to be natu∣rally prone to err in the choice of  lasting  plea∣sures and when our passions have habitually wandered it is too difficult to reduce them into their proper channels When this is the case nothing but the change or variety of amusements stands any chance to make us easy and it is not  long ere the whole species is exhaustedI agree with you entirely in the necessity of a  sociable  life in order to be happy I do not think it much a paradox that any company is better than  none  I think it obvious enough as to the pre∣sent hour and as to any future influence soli∣tude has exceeding savage effects on our dispo∣sitionsI have wrote out my elegy I lay no manner of stress but upon the piety of itWould it not be a good kind of motto applied to a person you know that might be taken from what is said of  Ophelia  in  Hamlet  I tell thee faithless priest  A ministring angel shall Ophelia be  When thou art howling  I have amused myself often with this species of writing since you saw me partly to divert my present  impatience  and partly as it will be a picture of most that passes in my mind a por∣trait which  friends  may valueI should be glad of your profile if you have objections I drop my requestI should be heartily glad if you would come and live with me for any space of time that you could find convenientBut I will depend on your coming over with Mr Whistler in the spring I may possibly take a jaunt towards you ere long the road would furnish me out some visits and by the time I reached you perhaps afford me a kind of cli∣max of happiness If I do not I shall perhaps be a little time at Bath I do not speak of this last as a scheme from which I entertain great expectations of pleasure It is long since I have considered myself as  undone  The  world  will not perhaps consider me in that light entirely till I have married my maid Adieu  XL To the same with Observations on the Rebellion and its probable Consequences  The Leasows  Nov  Dear Mr Graves  MY life for aught I see will pass away just as it  has  done without introducing sufficient improvement into my circumstances to give a chearful cast to my correspondence In  one  respect in regard to my inviolable friend∣ship for  you  I hope you will hear with some satisfaction that I continue still the same And this kind of  idenity  I think I could promise you though every circumstance in my fortune every particle of my body were changed and others ever so heterogeneous substituted in their place After this it would be no com∣pliment to say that the  pretended  heir to these kingdoms could not alter it were he to subvert the British constitution which must out of all doubt be the consequence of his success The rebellion you may guess is the subject of all conversation Every individual nailer here takes in a newspaper a more  pregnant  one by far than any of the London ones and talks as familiarly of  kings  and  princes  as ever Master Shallow did of John Gaunt Indeed it is no bad thing that they do so for I cannot con∣ceive that the people want so much to be con∣vinced by  sermons  of the absurdities of  popery  as they do by  newspapers  that  it  may  possibly  prevail The reasons and arguments too in fa∣vour of the present Government are so  strong  and  obvious  that even I and every country 'squire and every country clerk and Sam Shaw the taylor seem to be as much masters of them as the Bishops themselves I must not say we could express them so politelyI like  Secker's the best of any sermon on this occa∣sion He gives his audience a view of such evil consequences from a  change  as no man of sense can possibly doubt of when fairly stated and I own I cannot see one single  good  it could produce in compensation for its inevita∣ble and abundant  mischiefs  I have read Dr Sherlock's sermon on this occasion and I have read Mr Warburton's and at your request I will read his Legation  I have often thoughts of a jaunt as far as your country this winter Some kind of pilgrimage I must make to avoid a lethargyPublic places I want to visit a little to peep at and renew my ideas of the  world's  vanity but either Bath or London would steep me so far in po∣verty that I should not probably emerge before the middle of next summer I have spent this last summer agreeably enough with some of my young relations Mr Dolman's childrenThey have an excellent taste for their yearsI have been upon several jaunts with the son to Ditchfield Worcester Mr Fletcher's c amus∣ing him what I could under the loss of his father Miss W F asked very earnestly after you Two of the sisters have been with me at the Leasows and upon several parties of plea∣sure in my chairBroom is disposed ofI do not understand upon what inducementAfter all I am miserableconscious to myself that I am too little selfish that I ought now or ne∣ver to aim at some addition to my fortune and that I make large advances towards the common catastrophe of  better  poets povertyI never can attend enough to some twelvepenny matter on which a great deal dependsMy amour so far as I indulge it gives me some pleasure and no pain in the worldI have read Spenser once again and I have added full as much more to my  Schoolmistress  in regard to  number of  lines something  in point of  matter  or  manner  ra∣ther  which  does not displease me I would be glad if Mr were upon your request to give his opinion of particulars for two reasons as you say he has some taste for this kind of writ∣ing and as he is my enemy and would there∣fore find out its deficiencies  I have a reason of a most whimsical kind why I would wish you to preserve this letter Pray write soon and believe me most affectio∣nately  Your friend and humble servant W SHENSTONE  XLI To the same with Remarks on the Execution and Behaviour of the Lords Kilmarnock and Balmerino  ineunte anno  Dear Mr Graves  I BELIEVE it is impossible for me to dis∣agree with you on any other score than the scanty pittances you allot me of your compa∣ny and if I have disclosed any symptoms of resentment on that account you will perhaps overlook them out of regard to the motive from which they proceededI thank you for your perusal of that trivial poem If I were going to print it I should give way to your remarks  implicitly  and would not  dare  to do other∣wise But so long as I keep it in manuscript you will pardon my silly prejudices if I chuse to read and shew it with the addition of most of my new stanzas I own I have a fondness for several imagining them to be  more  in Spenser's way yet more independent on the antique  phrase than any part of the poem and on that account I cannot yet prevail on myself to banish  them  entirely but were I to print I should with  some  reluctance give way to your sentiments which I know are just namely that they render the work too diffuse and flimsy and seem rather excrescences than essential parts of it  But of these things I say no more now I purpose staying a month with Mr Whistler in December if it suits him and then I hope I shall have a great deal of your company Let me hear something in your next of your  domestic affairs  I beg you would not make any grand decision without giving me some previous in∣formation I esteem this as due to the friend∣ship I have so long professed for you and from the friendship you have so long professed for me  I look upon the death of the two Lords as equally decent upon their respective principles Lord Kilmarnock I suppose joined the rebels through a view of bettering his circumstances conscious to himself that he was guilty of a crime the moment he did so This is agreeable to his speech before the Lords and to that me∣lancholy which he discovered upon the scaffold Death aggravated by guilt would sit heavier upon him than upon the other even supposing him to have had the same resolution Balme∣rino's life was quite  unie  and his death equal to the character he aimed at We are to observe that he meant to suffer as a Friend to the Stu∣arts a Soldier and a Scotsman The first he manifested when he came out of the Tower by his reply of  "God save King Js"  the second by his dress and numberless ostentations of in∣trepidity the last by his plaid nightcap Did you hear the story of his sending a message to Lord Kilmarnock  "that he had been practising  how to lye upon the block and had found out the easiest way of receiving the blow was to bite his tongue hard or even if he bit it off it was no matter they should have no farther use for it"  His behaviour seems to have wanted coolness or else to equal that of Adrian Cato Sir T More c or any of those heroes who had spirit enough to make an ostentation of their unconcern I had from the printed accounts of their behaviour an idea of their persons exactly consormable to the de∣scription I read afterwards in your paperbut enoughyou send me sterling matters of fact and I return you tinsel observationsI thank you for accenting Crōmêrtie and Balmērīno I learnt Culloden from you  before  I have had little company since I saw youOne day indeed I was surprized by a visit from Mr Thomson Author of the SeasonsMr Lyttelton introduced himI have not room to tell you all that passedThey praised my place extravagantlyproposed alterations c Thomson was very facetious and very complaisant invited me to his house at Rich∣mond There were many things said worth  telling  but not  writing  to youThis has been a summer that I have spent more  socially  than any one these three years I expect a good deal more company this week the next and the week afterLady Luxborough talks of coming and I believe  will  The visit would bring my little walks into reputeWhen will the time come that I shall enjoy your company here a month uninterrupted Dear Sir  Yours most faithfully W SHENSTONE  XLII To the same with a new Theory of Political Principles  Dear Mr Graves  I HAVE lately received a letter from Mr Whistler which conveys your compliments to me and by so doing prompts me to ac∣knowledge the receipt of your last kind letter I observe you adhere strictly to the apostolical precept of being  "swift to  hear  slow to  speak  "  the latter part of which I would fain conclude you understand too literally  Your neighbour I see is not a little embar∣rassed with his mills at Whitchurch I have long had an eye upon his advertisement in the London Evening Post and been not a little scan∣dalized thereat What has the name of a poet to do with the publication of lands and tene∣ments or the idea of harmony with the noise of a watermill yet has he extracted music from the subject and mirth from his misfor∣tunes having sent me a ballad upon the miller written with much ease and some drollery  As to the light in which you place your pre∣sent fortunes I can only say that you have not that situation I could wish you for your  own sake  for so far as  I  am concerned in your ele∣vation I can assure you very faithfully that no circumstances in the world could more endear you to my affection or recommend you to my respect than the present My  affection  you will easily observe from the very  nature  of affec∣tion in general would stand no chance to be increased by your promotion and as for respect if I knew the degree you desired I would ac∣quit myself of it to your satisfaction  now  and were you settled at  Lambeth  I should expect that you would require no  more  from me upon that  account at least in private so that so far as either  deference  or  friendship  is concerned you are an Archbishop to  me  to all intents and pur∣posesAs to figure in the world it depends much I know upon advancement and yet even here you will be ever  sure  of that kind of weight which ingenuity gives discernable to the  smaller  indeed but undoubtedly the more  valuable  part of the worldbut this is impro∣per as it is  philosophy  and as it is  advice  neither of which is it suitable for me to suggest to you  "Alcinoo Poma c"  As to the long series of  my  lamentations I will not now enter upon the reasonableness of them It is a subject to tell you the truth on which you cannot reply with∣out some danger of hurting meAs for poli∣tics you will blame this letter for dwelling so much upon the subject of yours but as for politics I think  poets  are  tories  by nature sup∣posing them to be by nature poetsThe love of an individual person or family that has worn a crown for many successions is an inclination greatly adapted to the fanciful tribe On the other hand mathematicians abstractreasoners of no manner of attachment to persons at least to the  visible  part of them but prodigiously de∣voted to the ideas of virtue liberty and so forth are generally  whigs  It happens agreea∣bly enough to this maxim that the whigs are friends to that wise plodding unpoetical people the DutchThe Tories on the other hand are taken mightily with that shewy ostentatious nation the French Foxhunters that reside amongst the beauties of nature and bid defiance to art in short that have intellects of a poeti∣cal  turn  are frequently tories citizens mer∣chants c that scarce see what nature is and consequently have no pretensions to a poetical taste are I think generally argumentative and whiggishbut perhaps I carry this too far  Something there is in it however you will see not that I would apply what I here say to par∣ticular revolutions c I would only advance something general and speculative Nor would I approve or condemn by this any one set of people now existing Nor would I have you pretend to fish out my party from any thing I have said for I am of noneThe letter I sent you last was  occasional  and when I see you I will tell you the occasion I absolutely agree with you in every tittle of your political observationsI am glad I do for I know the poisonous nature of party and though we are  neither  vio∣lent yet I should fear it My schemes are  doubtful  at present but my face is set towards BathI am confident of the service those wa∣ters would do meI hope you will exhilarate me with a letter soonI would fain have fur∣nished out a letter to amuse you after so long a silence but I find myself unable even  as  un∣able as I am to express the regard with which I am  Yours W SHENSTONE  The Leasows  April  XLIII Continuation of the same  The Leasows  May  Dear Mr Graves  THOUGH I feel an irresistible propen∣sity to write to you this very post yet I cannot say that I am able to advance any thing tending either to your own or my satisfactionWhat is worst of all is I cannot fix the time of seeing you with so much precision as I would always endeavour where my pleasure is so much concernedI will tell you the whole affairI  have for a long season proposed to drink the Bath waters this spring and  did  think of set∣ting out in a week's time when I received your letter purposing to stay there a month and from thence take a circuit which should indulge me in a sight of you Mr Whistler and some few others in my way home The latter part of this scheme tho' far the more agreeable to me was rather doubtful and precarious depending as you express it on the state of my finances after a month's continuance at Bath which I considered and  do  consider as a very probable means of bettering my constitutionNow I covet to see you so much that I would bring nothing but health in competitionWhat I wish is that you could with convenience either  hasten  or  delay  your journey that you might find me before mine or after my return though I should infinitely and for many reasons prefer the former I long to talk with you particularly now I have much to say in regard to our friend's amour to which you alluded in your last I request it as a favour of you that you would conjure him by the friendship I have ever borne him and by any esteem which he has ever professed for me that he would do nothing very  material  in the affair till I have talked it over and given him my faithful sen∣timents  "quod censet amiculus"  I am not willing the balance should turn en∣tirely on the whig side I would give it a grea∣ter equilibrium if the following suggestion might effect it Tories I said have great and sometimes partial affections for the  person  of a kingWe will suppose that kings are alter∣nately good and bad their loyalty to the good one is commendable their partiality to the bad one not to be vindicated Whigs have  no  pas∣sion  no  gratitude towards to the good prince there they are wrong They are severe upon the  bad one in which they are justifiable I wish I had not begun these wholesale distinctions this miserable specimen of my politics I pro∣test against all epistolary disputes I am now embarrassed in one on much such another score which fills up all my letter for I love the last word like a scold or a childI thank you for your little anecdotes from time to time you may depend upon it that I have never heard any thing  before  for I never  do  hear any thingI am one very thankful letter in debt to your neighbour Whistler I have at present nothing but the  propensity  of a good correspondent but I will write soon In the mean time if you see him ask him if he goes to Bath or Bristol this seasonI beg you would write to me di∣rectly  when  you can come and how I may re∣gulate my motions so as to be best assured of seeing youPray do not neglect a post I am  Yours most entirely W S  XLIV To the same on the Mixture of Pleasure and Pain  The Leasows  June the last  Dear Mr Graves  IT is now I believe near half a year since I had the favour of a letter from you When I wrote last I discovered a more than ordinary solicitude for  one  immediate answer It puzzles me to account for your unusual silence other∣wise than upon supposition of some offence you have taken and it puzzles me as much to guess by what behaviour of mine I have been so un∣happy as to give you that offence  I am vain enough to imagine that the little merit I have deserves somewhat more regard than I have met with from the world Be that as it will the disappointment I must undergo by any  appearance  of neglect from the friends I value would more effectually dispirit me than any other whatsoever  I have published my design of visiting you and Mr Whistler in Oxfordshire to all the world A thousand incidents have hitherto in∣terfered with it which I will not now recount But when I look back upon the regular suc∣cession of them it looks as if Destiny had some hand in detaining me The most  vigorous  of my  hopes  dwell upon seeing you next win∣ter though I am not a little indulgent to  those  that tell me I may see you long before  I have brought my place here to greater per∣fection than it has ever yet appeared in and with the  mob  it is in some vogue Neverthe∣less I do not know that I ever relished it less in my life than I have done this summer Bad health bad spirits no company to my mind and no correspondences are enough to blast the sweetest shades and to poison the purest fountains Some of these misfortunes I can im∣pute to my own misconduct and it embitters them The two last I can less account for ha∣ving at all times done all I was able to recom∣mend myself to my  friends  behaving at the same time with courtesy to the rest of the world The fact is not true otherwise I might resolve it into this that I alone am idle and all the world is  busy  I fancy you will imagine I lay too much stress upon Mr Thomson's visit when I mention the following inscription upon a seat in Virgil's grove  CELEB  MO  POETAE  JACOBO THOMSON S  PROPE FONTES ILLI NON FASTIDITOS  G S  SEDEM HANC ORNAVIT  Quae tibi quae tali reddam pro carmine dona  Nam neque me tantum  venientis  The verse whispers here  sibilus  Austri  Nec percussa juvant fluctu tam litora nec quae  Saxosas inter decurrunt flumina valles  VIRG  I want your opinion of it and whether it were not better thus  THOMSON  QVI CVM QVICQVID VBIQVE RVRIS EST  AVT AMOENVM AVT VARIVM  MIRE DEPINXERAT  HOS ETIAM FONTES NON PASTIDIVIT  But you will discover at first glance an impro∣priety in bothNow I am upon inscriptions I send you one from a coin dug up very near me a few weeks ago Round the head  IMP  V AVG GER DAC M  On the reverse  S P Q R OPTIMO PRINCIPI COS VI  Within which is an human figure sitting with one hand reclined upon a wand the other as I take it holding forth an olive I have given my opinion it is one of Trajan's and my virtuoso character will rest upon the truth  of it It is a silver coin but very obscureThere appears a large mass of ruins rough stone very strongly cemented where they found itIf you were here it might amuse you  Heaviness may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morningI have so settled a notion of the proportionate mixture of pleasure and pain in this life that I expect one to suc∣ceed the other as naturally as day and night I own this is owing to the soul as much as to outward incidents Sorrow prepares it for mirth and  vice versa  The durations of both differ Last summer I spent agreeably this quite otherwise Today I have been quite me∣lancholy I expect happiness tomorrow from either an aptitude of mind or some incident sufficient to overcome its inaptitudePerhaps that incident may be a letter from you I wish it may and am most truly  Yours W S  I had a coin of Vespasian given me to day and I begin a collection if you have any du∣plicates you will please to oblige meI want to correct my elegies by your assistanceI will begin no more  XLV To the same with Thoughts on Advice  The Leasows  Sept  Dear Mr Graves  I AM under some apprehension that you dread the sight of a letter from me as it seems to lay claim to the compliment of an answer I will therefore write you one that shall wave its  privilege at least till such time as your leisure encourages or your present dissipation does not forbid you to send oneI dare now no longer expatiate upon the affair you have in hand it is enough for me if you will excuse the free∣dom I  have  taken I have often known  delay  produce good effects in some cases which even sagacity itself could not surmount and if I thought I did not go too far would presume to recommend it now You know I have very little of the temper of an alderman I almost hate the  idea  of wealthiness as much as the  word  It seems to me to carry a notion of ful∣ness stagnation and insignificancy It is this disposition of mine that can  alone  give any weight to the advice I send you as it proves me not to give it through any partiality to fortune As to what remains you are I hope assured of the value I must ever have for you in  any  circum∣stances and the regard I shall always shew for any that belongs to you I cannot like you  less  or  more  I now drop into other matters Ber∣gen I see is taken at lost pray what are the sentiments of your political companions I dined some time ago with Mr Lyttelton and Mr Pitt who both agreed it was worth twenty thousand men to the French which is a light in which I never used to consider it Any little intimation that you please to  confer  upon me en∣ables me to seem  wise  in this country for a month particularly if I take care to adjust my face accordingly As I was returning last Sun∣day from church whom should I meet in my way but that  sweetsouled  bard Mr James Thom∣son in a chaise drawn by two horses lengthwaysI welcomed him into the country and asked him to accompany Mr Lyttelton to the Leasows who had offered me a visit which he promised to do So I am in daily expectations of them and all the world this week I fancy they will  lavish all their praises upon  nature  reserving none for poor  art  and  me  But if I ever live and am able to perfect my schemes I shall not despair of pleasing the sew I first began with  the few friends prejudiced in my favour  and then  "Fico por los malignatores"  Censures will not affect me for I am armed so strong in  va∣nity  that they will pass by me as the idle wind which I regard not I think it pretty near equal in a country place whether you gain the small number of tasters or the  large crowd  of the vul∣gar The latter are more frequently met with and  gape stupent  and  stare  much more But one would chuse to please a few  friends  of taste before mob or gentry the great vulgar or the small because therein one gratifies both one's social passions and one's pride that is one's  self  love Above all things I would wish to please  you  and if I have a wish that projects or is pro∣minent beyond the rest it is to see you placed to your satisfaction near me but Fortune must vary from her usual treatment before she favours me so farAnd yet there  was  a time when one might probably have prevailed on her I knew not what to doThe affair was so intricately circumstancedyour surprizing silence after the hint I gaveMr D offering to serve any friend of mine nay pressing me to use the op∣portunityHis other relations his guardians teizing him with sure symptoms of a rupture in case of a refusal on  their  sideMr P solicit∣ing me if the place were  sold  which it could not legally be Friendship propriety imparti∣ality selfinterest which I  little  regarded endea∣vouring to distract me I think I never spent so disagreeable an halfyear since I was born To close the whole I could not  foresee  the event which is almost foretold in your last letter and I knew I could not serve you but I must ren∣der it a  necessary  one In short when can tell  you the whole affair at leisure you will own it to be of such a nature that I must be ever in sus  ence concerning my behaviour and of course shall never reflect on it with pleasure Believe me with the truest affection  Yours W SHENSTONE  XLVI To a Friend from The Leasows    Dear Sir  IT is not much above two hours since I re∣ceived your obliging letter and I am al∣ready set down to answer itTo speak the truth I had almost given you over I imagined you had taken umbrage at some expression or circum∣stance in my epistle and were determined to make me sensible you did so by your silence I hope this error of mine will serve to establish one rule on  both  sidesIt is what ought I am sure always to take place where people wish a perpetuity of friendship I mean never upon circumstances of disrespect to admit of circum∣stantial evidence  I am very grave so you may depend on the sincerity of all I shall say I saw several beau∣ties in your former elegy but though it was  "formosa"  it did not appear to me  "ipsa forma"  I like this that you have now sent  very  much It has a simplicity which your last a little wanted and has thought  enough  I begin to be seldom pleased with the compositions of others or my own but I could be really  fond  of this with a sew alterations that I could pro∣posebut you must know at the same time  that these are such as no one would approve beside myselfI know it However there are some seeming  faults  in it  I have been greatly mortified in my correspon∣dents of late I even said in my haste All friends are faithlessG after a month's ex∣pectation which he had confirmed to me of seeing him here let me know about a fortnight since that I had more leisure than him and since it did not suit his convenience to come I ought to take the opportunity of visiting him and seeing Derbyshire while he continues in itW has not wrote to me these six weeksOuting has been moreover dumb for the same space of time and I purpose in my heart to behave with some distance toward both for this neglect see my rule of circumstantial evi∣dence  It is a pity you cannot spare a day or two to come and see me My wood grows excessively pleasant and its pleasantness vexes me because nobody will come that can taste it  Your health according to your description is much the same with mine but from the gaiety of your style and  designs  I collect that it is greatly better  I have an alcove six elegies a seat two epi∣taphs one upon myself three ballads four songs and a serpentine river to shew you when you come Will the compositions come safe to you if I send my book which contains the  only  copies of several things which I could not re∣member if they were lostbut I will not send them If my horse gets well I may essay a visit for two days and bring them with me that I may make comments while you read them as beseemeth a genuine author to do  I am raising a greenhouse from the excrescen∣ces of Lord Dudley's but I do not find that  "vient l'appetit en mangeant"  that I grow fonder of my collection proportionable as it in∣creases  I should think myself fortunate enough at pre∣sent if like you I could only find that I had been mentioned for a vacant post but I have withdrawn all my views from courtpreferment and fixed them on finding a pot of money which I determine to be the far more probable scheme  I have little health and frequent mortification so that no one need envy me and yet I be∣lieve there  are  that do Are any enviable but such as are unambitious I never shall be able to reckon myself of that tribe which have en∣grossed all  happiness  to themselves and left the rest of the world nothing but hopes and posses∣sions Yet I do not much feel the pains of am∣bition while I am conversing with ingenious friends of my own level but in  other  company it hurts me Let me advise you now I think of it to dread the company of silly people outoftheway people and in one word what men of genius  call the vulgar  You run ten times the risque of being mortified voluntarily or unknow∣ingly amongst the latter of these to what you do amongst men of sense and politeness be they ever so maliciousbut my paper is filled  Do write soon  XLVII To the same  It is somewhere about the th of Sept  and I write from The Leasows  Dear Sir  I THINK I have lived to out correspond almost all my correspondents whether you are the last that is to be subdued I will not say  the rest are so fatigued that they are not able to atchieve a line Apprized of this and being by nature disposed to have mercy on the vanquished  "parcere subjectis"  I seldom write a syllable more than is requisite to further some scheme or ascertain some interview the latter of these be∣ing the purpose of  this  mine epistle I am in great hopes I shall be at liberty to see you ere many weeks be past and would beg of you in the mean time to inform me by a letter when I am likely or when very  unlikely  to meet you at home I am detained just at present by con∣tinual expectations of the Hagley family  As I was returning from church on Sunday last whom should I meet in a chaise with two horses lengthways but that right friendly bard Mr Thompson I complimented him upon his arrival in this country and asked him to accom∣pany Mr Lyttelton to The Leasows which he said he would with abundance of pleasure and so we parted You will observe that the more stress I lay upon this visit and the more I  discover  to you the more substantial is my apology for deferring mine into Warwickshire I own I am pleased with the prospect of shewing them something at The Leasows beyond what they ex∣pect I have begun my terras on the high hill I shewed you made some considerable improve∣ments in Virgil's grove and finished a walk from it to the house after a manner which you will approve They are going to build a castle in the park round the lodge which if well exe∣cuted must have a good effect and they are going likewise to build a rotund to terminate the visto The fault is that they anticipate every thing which I propose to do when I become  rich  but as that is never likely to be perhaps it is not of any importancebut what I term  rich  im∣plies no great deal I believe you are a witness to the moderation of my desires and I flatter  myself that you will believe your friend in  that  respect something above the vulgar  Crede non illum tibi de scelestâ  Plebe dilectum neque sic fidelem  Sic lucro aversum potuisse nasci  Patre pudendo  If I come to your house positively I will not go to see Mr M He has been twice as near me as The Grange with C L and never deemed my place worth seeing I doubt you are a little too modest in praising it wherever you goWhy don't you applaud it with both hands  "utroque pollice""Parcentes ego dexteras odi sparge rosas"  I am so very  partial  to my native place that it seems a miracle to me that it is not more famous But I complain unjust∣ly of you for as you have always contributed to my happiness you have taken every opportu∣nity to contribute to my figure I wish I could say the same of some who have it  more  in their  power  I have yet about a thousand things to say to younot now thoughLady Lh's visit I reserve till I see you A coach with a coronet is a pretty kind of phaenomenon at my doorfew prettier except the face of such a friend as you for I do not want the grace to prefer a generous and spirited friendship to all the gew∣gaws that ambition can  contrive  I have wrote out my elegies and heartily wish you had them to look over before I comeI know not how to send themI shall bring and leave some poetry with you  "Thus odores"  or rather a pro∣per covering for  "Thus odores piper quicquid chartis amicitur ineptis"  Adieu dear Sir  Believe me ever yours W SHENSTONE  XLVIII To the same with a Song    Dear Sir  BEING just returned from a small excursion it was with the utmost pleasure that I read over your letter and though it abounds both in wit and waggery I sit down incontinently to answer it with  none  The agreeableness of your letters is now heightened by the surprize they give me I must own I have thought you in a manner lost to the amusements in which you once delighted cor∣respondences works of taste and fancy c If you think the opinion worth removing you need only favour me with such a letter now and then and I will place you in my imagination where you shall see all the favourites of fortune cringing at your feet  I think I could add about half a dozen hints to your observations on electricity which might at  least  disguise the facts and then why will you not put it into some newspaper or monthly pamphlet you might discover yourself to whom you have a mind It would give more than ordinary pleasure at this timeSome other will take the hintPity your piece should not have the advantage of novelty as well as wit  I dined and stayed a night with Dr E he was extremely obliging and I am glad of such a friend to visit at B He asked much after youHe shewed me his OvidI advised him to finish some one epistle  highly  that he might shew itThe whole will  not take  though it goes against me to tell him so I should be glad he could succeed at B and could I serve him it would be with a safe conscience for I take him to  excel the rest of B physicians far in point of speculation and diligence c  I send you the song you asked for and request of you to write me out your new edition of the election verses and at your  leisure  a copy of the poem which we altered  THE LARK  GO tuneful bird that gladd'st the skies  To Daphne's window speed thy way  And there on quiv'ring pinions rise  And there thy vocal art display  And if she deign thy notes to hear  And if she praise thy matin song  Tell her the sounds that sooth her ear  To simple British birds belong  Tell her in livelier plumes array'd  The bird from Indian groves may shine  But ask the lovely partial maid  What are his notes compar'd to thine  Then bid her treat that witless beau  And all his motley race with scorn  And heal deserving Damon's woe  Who sings her praise and sings forlorn  I am Sir Your most faithful friend and servant W SHENSTONE  Have you read Watson Martyn and Freke on electricity I accidently met with the two former by which my head is rendered almost giddy electrics nonelectrics electrics  per se  and bodies that are only conductors of electricity  have a plaguy bad effect on so vortical a brain as mine  I will infallibly spend a week with you per∣haps about February if it suits you though I think too it must be later  I have been painting in water colours during a visit I made flowers I would recommend the amusement to you if you can allow it the time that is expedient  I trust you will give me one entire week in the spring when my  e alterations may exhibit themselves to advantage  XLIX To the same after a Visit  Sunday Feb  Dear Mr Jago  I AM tempted once more to apologize for the the unseasonable visit I paid you though I feel myself entirely innocent in that respect even as much as the postboy was guilty for had my previous letter arrived in due time you had then been furnished with an opportunity of waving my company till a more convenient season I was  only  or at least  chiefly  uneasy upon  your  ac∣count I spent my time very agreeably and only less so than I might had I not been con∣scious to myself that I was intruding upon do∣mestic tendernesses  I spent the Sunday night and the next day at Mr Wren's and am now just returned from Mr Dolman's who has made me a genteel present of Spence's Polymetis I have not yet  read  many dialogues in it but I have  dipped  in several and have reason to be well enough satisfied with the simple and uninvidious manner in which he has introduced Mr Lowth's poem I have long  known of this intended  introduction  which I acci∣dentally found to have to have been settled be∣twixt them before I published  mine  on the same subject and a little dreaded the  form  of it I have long ago made considerable improvements in mine and have a mind one day to publish it once more after which let it sleep in peace I have sometimes thought of printing my next titlepage thus viz  "Poems consisting of Songs Odes and Elegies with an improved edition of The Judgment of Hercules and of The Shoolmistress"  But I have but very few critical acquaintance and I live at a great dis∣tance from those I have stationed amongst the  makers  and the  wearers  of hobnails  Far from the joys that with my soul agree  From  wit  from  learning  very far from thee  PARNELL  I know I have thrown a great number of care∣less things into your hands I know to  whom  I intrusted my follies but I know  not  what they  are  I believe in general that they consist of misbegotten embryos and abortive births which it had been merely decent to have buried insome part of my garden but I was morally assured that you would expose nothing of mine to my disadvantage As to some that are  less im∣perfect  you promised your observations and I desire you would make them with the utmost freedom I can bear any censure which you shall pass by way of letter and I beg once more that you would not be sparing It will be esteemed as great a favour as you can do me When they have gone through your hands and those of one or two more friends I shall per∣haps think of publishing them though as to that much depends upon the advice I receive and previously on the opportunity I have of re∣ceiving  I am in hopes that you will be pretty full in discovering to me  which you dislike the least what faults you find  and  what improvements they are capable of  I set you a tedious task but I will return the favour as far as I am able either in the  same way  or any other This brings me to say that if there be any compositions of yours that you would have me to correct and there are several of which I want a copy I would beg you to send them Your Blackbird excels any singingbird I ever heard and I beseech you to convey it to The Leasows by the next opportu∣nity that he may acquire s  me near other  ills and in other valleys than those in which he was producedI have many compliments to make in your country to Mr H Mrs N Mrs J Mr F Mr T and your brother If I go over to Mr W's I will assuredly call and spend a night with you  That  is precariousBut whether I do or not I would willingly hope to see you this spring and summer more than once as a  critic  and as a  friend  nor do I forget the promise of Mr H and Mr Fbut of these things more when I send for the papers which I purpose to do tomorrow fortnight that is the twentyninth of February  I have suffered greatly by railing at the black button on a parson's great coat Had Mr Hall's been thus distinguished he could not have mis∣taken mine for his own which latter I sent in order to be commuted at Birmingham and was almost starved to death before I could accomplish the exchange There is no trifling with any  part  of orthodoxy with impunityThat is the moral  I have received a very obliging letter from Lady Luxborough wherein she tells me that Lady Hartford admires my place in her descrip∣tion Mr Thomson is intimate at Lady Hart∣ford's and I suppose Lady Hartford may have  been informed by L L that Mr Thomson has been here so I conclude in mere vanity that my farm is advancing in reputation  What think you of Mr Carte's History or what of his narrative concerning the Pretender's touching for the King's evil I think one is not however to give up his book entirely because with  all his superstition  he may have several anec∣dotes that one would like to read  I have had great expectations from the beau∣tiful veins of a piece of oak of which I have had a table made but upon a thorough survey of it it is so like nothing in the world as old B's callimanco nightgown  I have nothing to add worth beginning upon another page but I happened not to make a re∣gular conclusion in my preceeding one  You must give me some time to colour you a collection of flowers that octavo edition I shewed you here and then I will make Mrs Jago a present of it I believe I can engage Mr Dolman to assist me who is much my superior in point of accuracy and the inscription at the beginning is to run somehow thus  ELEGANTISSIMAE PVELLAE  DOROTHEA FANCOVRT  QVAE PERDILECTI

more expressive of the regard which I have ever borne and still bare you  Lord Dudley is gone and franks are no more I have nothing to wish you but health and pre∣ferment  "det vitam det opes"  with these you will easily compound that cordial  happiness  having every other ingredient that is requisite at hand  I am most affectionately Your very faithful friend c W SHENSTONE  L To Mr JAGO  The Leasows  Mar  Dear Sir  I HAVE sent Tom over for the papers which I left under your inspection have nothing to to add upon this head but that the more  freely  and  particularly  you give me your opinion the greater will be the obligation which I shall have to acknowledge  I shall be very glad if I happen to receive a good large bundle of your own compositions in regard to which I will observe any commands which you shall please to lay upon me  I am favoured with a certain correspondence by way of letter which I told you I should be glad to cultivate and I find it very entertaining  Pray did you receive my answer to your last letter sent by way of London I should be ex∣tremely sorry to be debarred the pleasure of writing to you by the post as often as I feel a violent propensity to describe the notable inci∣dents of my life which amount to about as much as the tinsel of your little boy's hobby∣horse  I am on the point of purchasing a couple of busts for the niches in my hall and believe me my good friend I never proceed one step in or∣namenting  my little farm but I enjoy the hopes of rendering it more agreeable to you and the small circle of acquaintance who sometimes favour me with their company  I shall be extremely glad to see you and Mr Fancourt when the trees are green that is in May but I would not have you content your∣self with a single visit this summer If Mr Hardy to whom you will make my compli∣ments inclines to favour me so far you must calculate so as to wait on him whenever he finds it convenient though I have  better hopes  of mak∣ing his reception here agreeable to him when my Lord Dudley comes downI wonder how he would like the scheme I am upon of exchanging a large tankard for a silver standish  I have had a couple of paintings given me since you were here One of them is a Madona valued as it is said at ten guineas in Italy but which you would hardly purchase at the price of five shillings However I am endeavouring to make it out to be one of Carlo Maratt's who was a first hand and famous for Madonas even so as to be nicknamed  "Cartuccio delle Ma∣donne"  by Salvator Rosa Two letters of the cypher CM agree what shall I do with regard to the third It is a small piece and sadly black∣ened It is about the size though not quite the shape of the Bacchus over the parlour door and has much such a frame  A person may amuse himself almost as cheaply as he pleases I find no small delight in rearing all sorts of poultry geese turkeys pullets ducks c I am also somewhat smitten with a blackbird which I have purchased a very sine one brother by father but not by mother to the unfortunate bird you so beautifully describe a copy of which description you must not fail to send mebut as I said before one may easily habituate one's self to cheap amusements that  is  rural  ones for all town amusements are hor∣ridly expensiveI would have you cultivate your garden plant flowers have a bird or two in the hall they will at  least  amuse your chil∣dren write now and then a song buy now and then a book write now and then a letter to  Your most sincere friend and affectionate servant W SHENSTONE  P S I hope you have exausted all your spirit of criticism upon my verses that you may have none left to cavil as this letter for I am ashamed to think that  you  in particular should receive the dullest I ever wrote in my life Make my compliments to Mrs JagoShe can go a little abroad you sayTell her I should be proud to shew her The Leasows Adieu  LI To Mr on his Marriage  This was written  August but not sent till the th  Dear Sir  HOW little soever I am inclined to write at this time I cannot bear that you should censure me of unkindness in seeming to overlook the late change in your situation It will I  hope  be esteemed superfluous in  me  to send you my most cordial wishes that you may be happy but it will perhaps be  something  more significant to say that I believe you  will  building my opi∣nion on the knowledge I have long had of your own temper and the account you give me of the person's whom you have made choice of  to whom I desire you to pay my sincere and most affectionate compliments  I shall always be glad to find you  praesentibus aequum  though I should always be pleased when I saw you  tentantem majora  I think you should neglect no  opportunity  at this time of life to push your fortune so far as an  elegant  competency that you be not embarrassed with those kind of soli∣citudes toward the evening of your day  Ne te semper inops agitet vexetque cupido  Ne pavor rerum  mediocriter utilium  spes  I would have you acquire if possible what the world calls with some  propriety  an  easy  fortune and what I interpret such a fortune as allows of some inaccuracy and inattention that one may not be continually in suspence about the laying out a  shilling  this kind of advice may seem ex∣tremely dogmatical in  me  but if it carries any haughty air I will obviate it by owning that I never  acted  as I say I have lost  my  road to hap∣piness I confess and instead of pursuing the way to the fine lawns and venerable oaks which distinguish the region of it I am got into the pitiful parterregarden of amusement and view the nobler scenes at a  distance  I think I can see the  road  too that  leads  the better way and can shew it others but I have many miles to mea∣sure back before I can get into it myself and no kind of resolution to take a single step My chief amusements at present are the same they have long been and lie scattered about my farm The French have what they call a  parque ornée  I suppose approaching about as near to a garden as the park at Hagley I give my place the title of a  ferme ornée  though if I had money I should hardly confine myself to such decora∣tions as that name requires I have made great improvements and the  consequence  is that I long to have you see them  I have not heard whether Miss's match proceededI suppose your objections were grounded on the person's  age  and  temper  and that they had the less weight as they supposed you acted indiscreetly yourself I can say but little on the occasion You knowbetter than I do Only this I must add that I have so great an esteem for your sister that it will be ne∣cessary to my  ease  that whoever marries her she should be happy  I have little hopes that I shall now see you often in this country though it would be  you  in all probability as soon as  any  that would take a journey of fifty miles  To see the  poorest  of the sons of men  The truth is my affairs are miserably embroiled by my own negligence and the nonpayment of tenants I believe I shall be forced to seize on one next week for three years and a half's rent due last Ladyday an affair to which I am greatly averse but through  indolence  and  compassion  I hope however I shall be always able as I am sure I shall be desirous to entertain a friend of a  philosophical regimen  such as you and Mr Whist∣ler and that will be all I can do  Hagleypark is considerably improved since you were here and they have built a castle by way of ruin on the highest part of it which is  just  seen from my  wood  but by the removal of a tree or two growing in a wood that joins to the park and which fortunately enough belongs to Mr Dolman and me I believe it may be ren∣dered a considerable object here  I purpose to write to Mr Whistler either this post or the next The fears you seemed in upon my account are very kind but have no grounds I am dear Mr habitually and sincerely  Your most affectionate W SHENSTONE  My humble service to your neighboursSmith whom you knew at Derby will publish a print of my grove in a small collection  LII To Mr JAGO with an Invitation to The LEASOWS  Sept Saturday night  Dear Mr JAGO  I HARDLY know whether it will be pru∣dent in me to own that I wrote you a  long letter  upon the receipt of your last which I now have upon my table I condemn this habit in  myself  entirely and should I am sure be very unhappy if my friends by my example should be induced to contract the same The truth is I had not expressed myself in it to my mind and it was full of blots and blunders and interlin∣ings yet such as it was it had wearied my at∣tention and given me a disinclination to begin it a fresh I am now impatient to remove any scruple you may have concerning my grateful sense of all your favours and the invariable continuance of my affection and esteemI find by your last obliging letter that my machina∣tions and devices are not entirely privateYou knew of my draught of Hagley Castle about the bigness of a barleycorn you knew of our in∣tended visit to Lady Luxborough's and I must add Mr Thomas Hall knew of my contrivance for the embellishment of Mr Hardy's house Nothing is there hid that shall not be revealedOur visit to Barrels is now over and padLady Luxborough has seen Hagley Castle in the origi∣naland as to my desire that my draught might be shewn to no  Christian  soul you surely did but ill with it when you shewed that  drawing  to a  Clergyman  However you may have acted up to my  real  meaning if you have taken care not to shew it to any connoisseur I meant chiefly to guard against any one that knows the rules in whose eyes I am sure it would not turn to my creditPray how do you like the festoons dang∣ling over the oval windowsIt is the chief advantage in repairing an old house that one may deviate from the rules without any extra∣ordinary censure  I will not trouble you  now  with many particu∣lars The intent of Tom's coming is to desire your company and Mrs Jago's this weekI should be extremely glad if your convenience would allow you to come on Monday or Tues∣day but if it is  entirely  impracticable I would beseech you not to put off the visit longer than the Monday following for the leaves of my groves begin to fall a great pace I beg once more you would let no small inconvenience prevent your being here on MondayAs to my visit at Icheneton you may depend upon it soon after and I hope you will not stand upon punc∣tilio when I mention my inclination that you may all take a walk through my coppices before their beauty is much impaired Were I in a sprightly vein I would aim at saying something genteel by way of  answer  to Mrs Jago's compli∣mentAs it is I can only thank her for the  substance  and applaud the  politeness  of itI post∣pone all other matters till I see you I am habi∣tually and sincerely  Your most affectionate friend W SHENSTONE  I beg my compliments to Mr Hardy  P S I am not accustomed my dear friend to send you a  blank  page nor can I be content to do so now  I thank you very  sensibly  for the verses with which you honour me I think them good lines and so do others that have seen them but you will give me leave when I see you to propose some little alteration As to an epistle it would be executed with  difficulty  and I would have it turn to your credit as well as my own But you have certainly of late acquired an  case  in writing and I am tempted to think that what you write henceforth will be universally good Persons that have seen your elegies like  "  The Blackbirds  "  best as it is most assuredly the most  correct  but I who pretend to great penetration can foresee that  "The Linnets"  will  be made to excelMore of this when I see you Poor Miss G J R says is married and poor Mr Thom∣son Mr Pitt tells me is  dead  He was to have been at Hagley this week and then I should pro∣bably have seen him  here  As it is I will erect an urn in Virgil's Grove to his memoryI was really as much shocked to hear of his death as if I had known and loved him for a number of yearsGod knows I lean on a very few friends and if they drop me I become a wretched mi∣santhrope  LIII To the same  Sunday night Sept  Dear Mr Jago  I TAKE this opportunity of acknowledging the justice of your excuses Mrs Jago's pre∣sent circ  stances render her visit quite imprac∣ticable and yours I have the same kind of reason to dispense with as I guess that she could as soon take a journey  herself  at this time as bear that  you  shouldBut to say I was not greatly  mortified would be doing myself the greatest injustice  Disappointed  I was you may be sure to hear excuses even as much as Sir John Fal∣staff when Mr Dombledon put him in mind of  security  instead of sending him  two  and  thirty yards  of sattin to make him a  short  cloak And on the whole I began to accuse you and Mrs Jago of  colloguing  together to fix your visit at a time when you were well assured you should have an  apology  to send me instead Now if I should press this accusation pray how would you evade the force of itThe next thing I am to speak to is your verses I have made you my ac∣knowledgments  before  and as you are so good as to accept them I will not trouble you with addi∣tional professions or repetitions of the past I will depend upon your goodsense for an excuse if I only add what I think proper as to any  alter∣ation  wherein I have a view to  your  credit as my  own  I confess it requires some nicety to inscribe such an elegy as The Goldfinches with∣out the danger you foresaw But I think it  may  be done and  is  pretty nearly in such manner as no man of  taste  will be tempted to ridicule it and as for the vulgar of whatever  rank  they be it is absolutely necessary many times to  give them up Taste  and  tenderness  are absolutely connected and you may very readily call to mind some charming things that must excite the laughter of your men of  fire  and  banter  but are by no means thought the worse of by men of  true genius  I will only mention Andrew Marvel's  Fawn  in Dryden's Miscellanies I inclose the elegy with some few proposed alterations so I will not risque the  silling  my  letter  with criticism I also inclose the other verses you sent me which I think good ones and to stand in need of little alteration beside that of the inglorious name at the head of them to which notwithstanding I will never submit Pray who is the young gen∣tleman  that translates your elegy into LatinThe new dress will give you some amusement and if these lines  be  the product of the genius of a boy of that age he will in a year's time be able to extend the same of your compositions I shall then be glad to see the Gold finches under his hand though I have no extraordinary fond∣ness for the Latin poetry of a modern at least till your eldest son begins to translate our ma∣drigals  I have not yet seen Mr Thomson's Castle of IndolenceI waited for a smaller edition but am now too impatient not to send for it on Thursday nextI am fully bent on raising a neat urn to him in my lower grove if Mr Lyttelton does not inscribe one at Hagley  before  me But I should be extremely glad of your advice where∣abouts to place itYou speak of my dwelling in the Castle of Indolence and I verily believe I  do  There is something like enchantment in my present inactivity for without any kind of lett or impediment to the correction of my trifles that I see I am in no wise able to make the leaft advances I think within myself I could pro∣ceed if you were here and yet I have reason to believe if you  were  here we should only ramble round the groves and chat away the time and perhaps  that  upon the  whole  is of full as much importanceI do not know but I do myself some little injustice here for I  have  wrote out my  levities  and my  sonnets  good and bad with many ornaments from the pencil and the next thing I do will be to transcribe my elegies The fault is I take no pains to  improve  what I tran∣scribe and consequently am only able to ex∣hibit my nonsense in a fairer dressYou must give me leave ere it be long to insert two or three lines I think in  verse  before Mrs Jago's flowerpieceI am sure I am obliged to her for a fruit I greatly loveIt was not entirely ripe  but it was the only one I have tasted since I was last in LondonYesterday dined here Lady Lux∣borough Mr Outing and Mr Hall Lord Dud∣ley Miss Lea Counsellor Corbet and Mr San∣ders Mr Perry Mrs Perry and Miss Dolman and half a dozen footmen beside my own ser∣vants and labourers so you may guess we had no small fracas I now sit down amid solitude and silence and can hear little else beside the pendulum of my clockyet my spirits are no way sunk but afford me just such a temperature of mind as inclines me to write to some familiar friend albeit I have a thousand things to  talk  of to you which I do not care to  write  I hope to be able to spend a few days with Mr Hardy be∣fore his melons are all gone and yet I would not have him keep one a  moment  longer upon  my  account I desire he would accept of my compli∣ments as I trust he willFranks at present run low with me but I send you  one  which you cannot use so soon but I shall be able to send you others immediately I wish I could send you any thing more than the means of obliging  Sir  Your most affectionate friend W S  LIV To the same  Sunday Nov  Dear Sir  I MUST fairly own that I have not sate down till now to return my acknowledg∣ments for your last most obliging favour and yet I have been doing so in  imagination  almost every day since I received it I have only to desire  that you would not think me  stupid  and then you must of course conclude me highly delighted to find the verses which had so greatly pleased me made so  particularly interesting  to me In tes∣timony hereof I have caused these my letters to be made  patent  c Furthermore I am glad to see you dissent from some alterations I proposed for which generally speaking I think I can see your reasons As to any little matter which I have to mention farther I chuse to defer it till I wait on Mr Hardy which I purpose to do before this month is out It may possibly  happen  the beginning of the next week but I dare not lay such stress upon a future  event  as to give you a commission to say so much to  him  Instead thereof please to make him my compliments and tell him I talk of coming  very soon  I borrowed Dodsley's Miscellany of Lady Lux∣borough in which are many good things I long to be making a mark on the head of every copy as I would do were the books my  own  Here a cypher there an asterism of five points and there one of eightIf you and Mr W and Mr G and I were together for a fort∣night to correct and revise might not we make a miscellany of  originals  that would sellMy fingers itch to be at itbut I fear it cannot beThomson's poem amused me greatlyI think his plan has faults particularly that he should have said nothing of the diseases attending lazi∣ness in his  first  canto but reserved them to strike us  more affectingly  in the last but on the whole who would have thought that Thomson could have so well imitated a person remarkable for simplicity both of sentiment and phrase  I study no connections in a letter and so I pro∣ceed to tell you that I have got a machine to exhibit landscapes c to advantage It costs about fourteen shillings and I recommend one to you or Mr HardySmith's Views with a  little colouring appear ravishinglybut if you are not content with  amusement  and want  fame  which differs about as much as  fox  hunting from  hare  hunting you must  print  However if you can acquiesce in a  limited reputation  to give you a proper weight at all your visitingplaces which I think enough for all reasonable ends and pur∣poses take the following receipt  A receipt to make FAME  TAKE a shoemaker into your parlour that is reputed a good workman and bid him procure a piece of red or blue Morocco leather let him shape this into the size of a quarter of a sheet of paper or it may be something larger Let him double it in such a manner as to leave some part to wrap over then stitch it neatly at the ends lining it either with silk or the best yellow leather he can meet with Then must you bespeak a silver clasp which you  may  have gild∣ed but be sure it be neatly  chased  and properly annexed to the aforesaid Morocco leather Make a present of this to the prettiest girl you know but filled with half a dozen of your best compo∣sitions take care that one be in praise of  her  in∣genuity For modesty sake desire her not to shew them to any living soul but at the same time be careful that your clasp be splendid and your lettercase made according to the foregoing direction  Adieu  seriously yours W S  LV To a Friend disappointing him of a Visit  June  FIE on Mr N he has disappointed me of the most seasonable visit that heart could wish or desireMy flowers in blossom my walks newly cleaned my neighbours invited and I languishing for lack of your company Mean time you are going to dance attendance on a courtierWould to God he may disappoint  you  according to the usual practice of those gentlemenI mean by giving you a far better living than you ever expected  I have no sooner  made  that I am ready to  re∣cal  that wish in order to substitute another in its place which is that you may rather squat yourself down upon a fat goose living in War∣wickshire or one in Staffordshire or perhaps Worcestershire of the  same denomination  I do not mention Shropshire because I think I am more remote from the main body of that county than I am from either of the others But never∣theless by all means wait on Mr N shew him all respect yet so as not to lay out any of the profits of your  contingent  living in a black vel∣vet waistcoat and breeches to appear before him True merit needeth nought of this Be∣sides peradventure you may not receive the first quarter's income of it this half year He will probably do something for you one time or other but you shall never go into Ireland that is certain for less than a deanry not for less than the deanry of St Patrick's if you take my advice Lower your hopes only to advance your surprise  "  grata  supervenient quae non sperabimus"  Come to me  as you may  A week is elapsed since you  began  to be detained you may surely come over in a fortnight now  at farthestI will be at homeHowever write directly you know our letters are long upon their journeyI expected you the be∣ginning of every week till I received your last letter  impatiently  For my part I began to wean myself from all hopes and expectations whateverI feed my wildducks and I water my carnations Happy enough if I could extinguish my ambi∣tion  quite  or  indulge  what I hope I feel in an equal degree the desire of being something more beneficial in my spherePerhaps some few other circumstances would want also to be adjusted  I have just read Lord Bolingbroke's three let∣ters which I like as much as most pieces of po∣litics I ever read I admire especially the spi∣rit of the style I as much admire  at  the edi∣tor's unpopular prefaceI know the family hi∣therto  seemed  to make it a point to conceal Pope's affair and now the editor under Lord B's in∣spection not only relates but invites people to think the worst of itWhat  collateral  reasons my Lord may have for thinking ill of Mr Pope I cannot say but surely it is not  political  to lessen a person's character that had done one so much honour  I am dear Sir Your affectionate W SHENSTONE  I have this moment received a long letter from Lady Luxborough and you are to look on all I said concerning both Lord Bolingbroke's affair and her resentment as premature My Lady's daughter and soninlaw visit her next week  LVI To Mr JAGO  From The Leasows  as it appears on a rainy Evening June  Dear Sir  IT would probably be so long before you can receive this letter by the post that I cannot think of subjecting my  thanks for your last  or my  hopes of seeing you soon  to  such  an  uncertainty  I shall not now have it in my power to meet you at Mr Wren's  immediately  so would lose no time in requesting your company here  next week  if you please I hope Mrs Jago also will ac∣company you and that you will set out the first day of the next week even Monday that you may not leave me in less than six days time un∣der a pretence of necessity As to the verses you were so kind to convey I will take occa∣sion when you come  To find out like a friend  Something to blame and mickle to com∣mend  So I say no more at  present  on that head  I love to  read  verses but I  write  none  "Petit nihil me sicut ante juvat scribere"  I will not say  none  for I wrote the following at break∣fast yesterday and they are all I have wrote since I saw you They are now in one of the roothouses of Virgil's Grove for the admoni∣tion of my good friends the vulgar of whom I have multitudes every Sunday evening and who very fortunately believe in fairies and are no judges of poetry  Here in cool grot and mossy cell  We tripping fawns and fairies dwell  Tho' rarely seen by mortal eye  Oft as the moon ascended high  Darts thro' yon limes her quiv'ring beam  We frisk it near this crystal stream  Then fear to spoil these sacred bow'rs  Nor wound the shrubs nor crop the flow'rs  So may your path with sweets abound  So may your couch with rest be crown'd  But illbetide or nymph or swain  Who dares these hallow'd haunts profane  OBERON  I suppose the rotund at Hagley is compleat∣ed but I have not seen it hitherto neither do I often journey or visit  any where  except when a shrub or flower is upon the point of blossom∣ing near my walksI forget one visit I lately made in my neighbourhood to a young clergy∣man of taste and ingenuity His name is Pix∣ell he plays  finely  upon the violin and very well upon the harpsichord has set many things to music some in the  soft way  with which I was much delighted He is young and has time to improve himself He gave me an opportunity of being acquainted with him by frequently visiting and introducing company to my walksI met him one morning with an Italian in my grove and our acquaintance has been growing ever sinceHe has a share in an estate that is near me and lives there at present but I doubt will not do so longwhen you come I will send for himHave you read my Lord Boling∣broke's Essays on Patriotism c and have you read Merope and do you take in the  Magazin des Londres  and pray how does your garden flourish I warrant you do not yet know the difference betwixt a ranunculus and an ane∣moneGod help yeCome to me and be  informed of the nature of all plants  "from the cedar on Mount Lebanon to the hyssop that springeth out of the wall"  Pray do not fail to decorate your new garden whence you may transplant all kinds of flowers into your verses If by chance you make a visit at I fifty years hence from some distant part of England shall you forget this little angle where you used to muse and sing  En unquam c  Post aliquot tua regna videns mirabere aristas  I expect by the return of Tom to receive a trifle that will amuse you It is a gold seal of Vida's head given by Vertue to a relation of mine who published Vida and introduced Ver∣tue into businessPerhaps you remember Mr Triftram of Hampton and the day we spent there from school it was his  I am very cordially Your's W SHENSTONE  LVII To the same    Dear Sir  IT is now Sunday evening and I have been exhibiting myself in my walks to no less than a hundred and fifty people and that with no less state and vanity than a Turk in his seraglioI have  some  hopes of seeing you  this  week but if these should happen to be frustrated I shall find them revive with double ardour and vivacity the next Did you tell me of a treatise that your  Mr Millar had where the author endeavours to vindicate and establish Gothic architecture and does not the same man explain it also by draughts on copper plates That very book or rather the title and the author's name I wantI shall never I believe be entirely partial to Goths or Vandals either but I think by the assistance of some such treatise I could sketch out some charming Gothic temples and Gothic benches for garden seatsI do also esteem it extremely ridiculous to permit another person to design  for  you when by sketching out your own plans you  appropriate  the merit of all you build and feel a double pleasure from any praises which it receivesI had here last Wednesday Dean Lyttelton Mr William Lyttelton Com¦modore West Miss Lyttelton and Miss West They drank tea and went round my walks where they seemed astonished they had been so long ignorant of the beauties of the place said in general every thing that was  complaisant  or  friendly  and left me highly delighted with  their  visit and with room to hope for many more Mean time why do not  you  come I  do  say you are not PyladesWhat you think be∣cause you have an agreeable wife and five fine children that you must employ all your time in caressing them at home or laying schemes for their emolument abroad Is this public spirit is this virtue or if it be virtue dost thou think because thou art  vartuous  there must be no cakes and ale is it not your duty to par∣take of them with a  friend  sometimes easing and relieving him under what Boileau calls  Le penible fardeau de n'avoir rien à faire  and what Pope  stealing  from the former deno∣minates  The pains and penalties of idleness  Pray come the first day of the week and let Mr Fancourt accompany youI have not much to add by way of news The Duke of Somerset is going to lay out thirty thousand pounds upon Northumberlandhouse nine houses to be purchased and pulled down on the other side the Strand for stables the Strand there to be widened I cannot tell you half but one thing more I will which is that there will be a chapel on one side of the quadrangle with a Gothick wainscot and cieling and paint∣ed glass and ☞ in it a Dutch stove contriv∣ed so as to look like a tomb with an urn up∣on it  What need I  write  all this am I not to see you in a few daysNot a word more posi∣tively having what may serve to assure you that I am dear Sir  Inviolably your's W SHENSTONE  The Leasows  July  LVIII To the same  The Leasows  March  Dear Sir  THOUGH I have not hitherto troubled you with a letter I have not been void either of  inquiry  or  information  concerning the state of your affairs and of Mr Hardy's health Indeed it is now several weeks since I collected some particulars from your brother and I am now impatient for further intelligence As to the circumstances of our friendly reception at Wroxall Mr John Jago has probably enough acquainted you with them He  would  however seduce me to give you a distinct account being  assured as he says that Mr Wren's behaviour must afford a good subject for drollery I do not know how far this would be proper but I think when I write again to my friend Wren to give him a sketch of his own character just as it appeared to us during the time of our vi∣sit Perhaps it may avail a little Amidst his violent passion for gardening if he would but prune away some wild excrescences from one or two branches of his character he might bring himself to bear good fruit He should  weed  his  mind  a little where there has sprung up a most luxuriant crop of puns that threaten to choak all its wholesome productions  "Spinas animo fortius quam agro evellat"  He has good sense and goodnature pity he should disguise themNot but that it is better to have the  substance  alone than the  forms alone  and so I con∣clude Since I came home I have done little else than plant bushes hazel hawthorn crabtree elder c together with some flowering shrubs that I have had given me and some that I have purchased to the amount of twenty shillings I think nothing remarkable has occurred only one miserable tempestuous day I had my Lord Stamford who called to see my walks My Lord promised to come again in the summer and invited me more than once to Enville By the way he is now building a Gothic green∣house by Mr Miller's direction and intends to build castles and Godknowswhat By all ac∣counts the place is well worth seeing when you come in to the country which I hope you will not fail to do this spring Pray do not you embroil me with Mr Miller in regard to  any  observa∣tions I made in his walks Remember there were a great many things with which I was highly delighted and forget that there were a few also which I seemed less to admire Indeed I thought it idle to regulate my expressions amongst friends only by the same rules which  I ought to observe in mixed company I say  ought  for  he  has been exceedingly favourable to  me  in his representation of the LeasowsI hope to see Mr Fancourt with you when you come this spring and why not your brother he can spend half a week every now and then at Wroxal  I have nothing to  insert  or  inclose  in this letter that can render it at all agreeableI cannot  write  I cannot  think  I can just muster up atten∣tion enough to give orders to my workmen I saunter about my grounds take snuff and read Clarissa This last part of my employment threatens to grow extremely  tedious  not but the author is a man of  genius  and  nice observation  but he might be less  prolix  I will send you  "The Life of Socrates"  when I can get it home from Barrels I wish both your circumstances and mine would allow of an utter  inattention  to them and then I believe our natural indo∣lence would be a kind of match for our ambi∣tion I shall probably enlarge my acquaintance this year but what  doth  it the circle of my friends with whom I can be  easy  and  amused  much will continue small as ever I could dwell a good deal upon this subject but I have only room to desire you would give me your opinion how I should inscribe my urn to Mr Somerville  "Author of the Chace"  cannot be tolerably expressed in Latin without a circumlo∣cution I aim at brevity and would therefore omit it Pray read over the specimens I have thrown together and  oblige  me with a speedy an∣swer if it extend to nothing else besides your's and Mrs Jago's health which I ought at this time more particularly to enquire after I am  Your most affectionate and faithful friend W SHENSTONE  LIX To the same  June  Dear Sir  I ACKNOWLEDGE myself obliged to you for procuring me the pictures I received them both very safe as I have a pretty strong assurance I  shall  do most articles of which my servant Tom has the careHe has punctuality and management to  alone  for his  imperfections  He brought me these papersculled busts from Wroxall entirely unhurt contrary to the expec∣tation of all that saw them after which he might undertake for almost any thingThe por∣trait is undoubtedly a good one I shewed it to Mr Smart who is a painter himself though a clergyman and he allowed as much added also that it had something of Sir Godfrey Knel∣ler as well as of Sir Peter LelyThe flowerpiece is very good so far as relates to the flow∣ers the dog and parrot abominable and the grapes very exceptionable I never consider the two flowerpieces at Icheneton with attention enough to cause a preference having never any thoughts that  either  would fall to my share I shall add nothing with regard to your choice but that I sincerely  hope  yours is the better piece I never heard of Casteels I own nor can I find his name in any of my accounts of the painters though they take in pretty modern ones but I can say this for your comfort that if he excelled in any thing it was probably in flowers for I see his name at the bottom of those flowerpieces that I have in water colours as the designer of them and I think the designs are good Though I could wish neither the Cupid nor the fruitpiece had escaped us yet is there no blame to be laid at your door at least supposing  that you are endowed with nothing more than rational conjecture and that you are not gifted with prophecy  And now having spoken I think to  most  parts of your letter I proceed to say a word or two in the way of appendix First then after five or six weeks work of masons and carpenters I plainly discover that my house is an unfinishable thingand yet I persuade myself there will never be wanting a room in it where you may spend an agreeable day with your undoubted friendDid I ever tell you how  unseasonably  the three fiddles struck up in my grove about an hour after you left me and how a set of ten bells was heard from my wood the evening after It might have passed for the harmony of some aerial spirit who was a wellwisher to us poor mortals but that I think had it been so it would have been addressed to the  better sort  and of consequence have been heard whilst  you  were  here  This by way of introduction to what I am going to tell you Mr Pixell has made an agree∣ment with his club at Birmingham to give me a day's music in some part of my walks The time is not yet fixed but if you were an idle man and could be brought over at a day or two's notice I would give it you and be in hopes I could entertain you very agreeably  You cannot think how much you gratified my vanity when you were here by saying that if this place were yours you thought you should be less able to keep within the bounds of  aeconomy  than myselfGod knows it is pain and grief to me to observe her rules at  all  and  rigidly  I never canHow is it possible to possess improveable scenes and not wish to improve them and how is it possible with oeconomy to be at the ex∣pence of improving them upon my fortune To be continually in fear of excess in perfecting every trifling design how irksome to be res∣trained  from attempting  any  how vexatious so that I never can enjoy my situationthat is certainOeconomy that invidious old matron on occasion of ever frivolous expence makes such a hellish squalling that the murmur of a cascade is utterly lost to meOften do I cry out with Cowley  O rivers brooks when when in  you  shall I  Myself eas'd of  unpeaceful  thought espy  O woods and groves when when shall I be made  The happy tenant of your shade  Paper fails abruptly therefore but sincerely and affectionately  I am dear Sir Yours W SHENSTONE  LX To C W  Esq  The Leasows  Sept  Dear Sir  PRAY is laziness an excuse for not writing Tell meHowever if it be so I am afraid I shall want an excuse for laziness like the philosopher who supposing the world might rest upon a tortoise's back found himself no less embarrassed for a pedestal to support his tortoise I have indeed been pretty busy at home in raising a pooldam and have interchanged a few visits with such of my acquaintance as live within three milesWhat thenI abominate all excuses that are grounded upon the business  or amusements of an idle manAs if such a person's time was so wholly filled up that he could not find half an hour to write a line to his friend It is best to acknowledge laziness at first and that there are particular intervals when one is much less disposed to write even a sew lines than at others And then as to laziness one has nothing to do but to plead human frail∣ty which if a person has not too many frailties besides may perhaps be indulged him How∣ever  "Veniam petimusque damusque"  will not fail to weigh with every goodnatured man The chief dealing I have with Harris the Jew is for the intelligence which he brings me con∣cerning you and Mrs W but it seldom amounts to much more than that you are well and in your garden  He is an Ebrew Jew or he would tell me you had purchased a couple of genteel horses or a chaise and pair and were coming over to The Leasows to spend a week with me  Nevertheless I hope to see you soon but  en passant  I assure you I shall go in about a month to Mr Jago's and from thence to Mr Miller's who I believe I told you was here with Mr Lyttelton Lady Aylesbury Colonel Conway c I think I never answered your query con∣cerning Colonel LytteltonHe is the same per∣son that you remember and your prophecy con∣cerning him has been literally accomplished He is a man of courage genius generosity and po∣liteness has been fortunate in the world was made a Colonel at about six and twenty dis∣tinguished himself in several campaigns mar∣ried the Dutchess of Bridgewater and had the other day about sixteen thousand pounds lest him by Colonel Jefferies a very distant relation He has a seat and speaks in the House of Commons has bought a town and countryhouse the latter of which he is ornamenting in the modern way  His Dutchess the most unceremonious eventempered woman that livesSo enjoy the spirit of prophecy and exert it againIt needs little more than good senseWhich of the histori∣ans is it that foretold in his history a very re∣markable series of events by dint of this alone and which were all accomplished Let me know what you are doing now Have you repaired the farmhouse you talked ofand have you remembered to make the man a couple of good large niches in his chimney corner where he and his family may spend a more comfortable evening than was ever spent by any first minister in Christendomperhaps also converse more to the purpose You tell me nothing of your Mr Jago Seignior Benedict the new married man Tell him to leave his wife and family for a day or two saddle his mule and come to The LeasowsTell him all pleasures are heighten∣ed by a little discontinuanceTell him did I say how can you for shame advise him so con∣trarily to your own practice  Believe me dear Sir Very faithfully yours W SHENSTONE  LXI To C W  Esq  The Leasows  Nov  Dear Sir  IT never can be that I owe you for three let∣ters as to two I will agree with you one that I received together with my books and the other soon after but that I am indebted for more than these  Credat Judaeus Apella  Non ego  Even that same  "Judaeus Apella"  who affords me this very opportunity of sending my compliments to you and Mrs W and of assur∣ing you that if I had not proposed to have seen you I had wrote to you long ago  Master Harris talks very respectfully of your garden and we have no dispute save only in one point He says that you labour very hard in your vocation whereas I am not willing to allow that all the work you ever did or will do in it is worth a single bunch of radishes How∣ever I dare not contradict him too much because he waits for my letter  How happy are you that can hold up your spade and cry  "Avaunt Satan"  when a toy∣man offers you his deceitful vanities Do not you rejoice inwardly and pride yourself great∣ly in your own philosophy  'Twas thus  The wise Athenian cross'd a glitt'ring fair  Unmov'd by tongues and sights he walk'd the place  Thro' tape tags tinsel gimp perfume and lace  Then bends from Mars's Hill his awful eyes  And "What a world I never want" he cries  PARNEL  Mean time do not despise others that can find any needful amusement in what I think Bun∣yan very aptly calls  Vanity fair  I have been at it many times this season and I have bought many kinds of merchandize there It is a part of philosopy to adapt one's passions to one's way of life and the solitary unsocial sphere in which I move makes me think it happy that I can retain a relish for such trifles as I can draw into it Mean time I dare not reason too much  upon this head Reason like the famous con∣cave mirrour at Paris would in two minutes vitrify all the Jew's pack I mean that it would immediately destroy all the form colour and beauty of every thing that is not merely usefulBut I ramble too far and you do not want such speculations My intent when I sat down was to tell you that I shall probably see you very soon and certainly remain in the mean time and at all times Sir  Your obliged and very faithful servant W SHENSTONE  LXII To a Friend on various Subjects    Dear Mr  WITH the utmost gratitude for the obser∣vations which you sent me and with the highest opinion of their propriety in gene∣ral do I sit down to answer your obliging let∣ter You will not take it amiss I know if I scrible broken hints and trace out little sketches of my mind just as I should go near to explain it if I were upon the spot as often as I think of you which I beg leave to assure you happens many times in a day They say  "A word to the wise is enough"  a word therefore to a friend of understanding may be supposed to be something more than enough because it is pro∣bable he is acquainted with three parts of one's mind beforeThe censure you have passed upon Milton's Lycidas so far as it regards the metre which he has chosen is unexceptionably just and one would imagine if that argument con∣cerning the distance of the rhimes were pressed home in a public essay it should be sufficient to extirpate that kind of verse for ever As to my opinion concerning the choice of English metre  I dare not touch upon the subject and I will give you my reason I began upon it in a letter which I intended for you about a month ago and I soon found that I had filled a sheet of paper with my dissertation and left no room for other things which I had more mind to com∣municate Beside I sound it so blotted that I did not chuse to send it and as the subject is so extremely copious I shall decline it entirely till  talking  may prove as effectual as  writing  As to your advice with regard to my publications I believe it to be just and shall in all probabili∣ty pursue itI am afraid by your account that Dodsley has published my name to the Schoolmistress I was a good deal displeased at his publishing that poem without my know∣ledge when he had so many opportunities of giving me some previous information but as he would probably disregard my resentment I chose to stifle it and wrote to him directly upon the receipt of yours that I would be glad to furnish him with an improved copy of the School mistress c for his second edition He accepts it with some complaisance desires it soon and I am at a fault to have the opinion of my friends what alterations or additions it will be proper to insert I have scribled a copy which I send this day to Mr Graves and Mr Whistler but I am greatly fearful I shall not receive their criticisms time enough and I shall have the same longing for yours A journey to Whitchurch which I have long proposed might unite all these ad∣vantages and I heartily wish I may be able to effect it without inconvenience If I go thither I call on you  I am ever and entirely yours W SHENSTONE  LXIII To the same  The Leasows  March  Dear Sir  WHAT a stupid fool was I to shew you those letters of my friend Graves where∣in he declares himself so freely against a regular correspondence see the effects of it You have taken immediate advantage of his example and I must never more expect an answer to any let∣ter that I send you in less than half a century I wrote to you after I came home to thank you for all your kindness at I c but not a syllable have I been able to receive from you or a word that I could hear concerning you I could however very easily convince you that Mr Graves your precedent is not altogether so hardened an offender as you may imagine His last letter is a very affectionate recantation I inclose that part of it which regards Mr F  What a number of schemes are irreparably broken by the sudden death of the Prince of Wales Yours my good friend which seems to be destroyed amongst the rest has I think of late given you no solicitude Your interest in Mr N will remain the same I suppose and if he would but serve you nearer  home  I will have no sort of quarrel with him that he did not transplant you into CornwallIt is at least some gratification to a person's self love when one finds the more  ambitious  hopes of more  aspir∣ing  people as liable to be suddenly extinguished as one's own However the death of the Prince gave me a good deal of concern though it no way affected my  particular  interest as he had all the humane affable and generous qualities which could recommend him to one's  affection  Mr Graves has sent me two copies of verses One on Medals to Mr Walker and the other  on the late Memoirs of the London Heroines Lady V Mrs Pilkington and Mrs Phillips Both good in their way which you shall see when you come over  Have you seen the first books of the Scri∣bleriad by Mr CambridgeThe Verses written in a Country ChurchyardMr W Whitehead's Ode to the Nymph of Bristol Springor what  have  you seenYou live infinitely more in the world than I do who hear nothing see nothing do nothing and  am  nothing Remedy this unhappiness by sending me somewhat that may rouse my attentionI must except what I hear from my Lady Luxbo∣rough who indulges me now and then with a letter in French  If you should think this letter more than usually  dull  you must know that since I saw you I have been  generally  dispirited till about a fortnight ago I found some nervous disorders that I greatly disliked and upon examination was told I had a nervous fever For this I have been taking saline draughts and bolus's and  hope  I am something better though I am far from well I would not indeed have written to you at this time but I chose not to defer send∣ing the inclosed postscriptYou who have shared many of my  happiest  hours will excuse the produce of a more than ordinary dull one  Mrs Arnold comes up to enquire after my health and wishes I may get better that I may stir out and see the  pretty creatures in the barn  It seems she has a cow or two that have calved since I kept my room  Why should I prolong a letter that has no kind of chance to afford you any amusement Make my compliments to Mrs and believe me to be ever most affectionately  Yours W SHENSTONE  I have just taken and signed a lease for life of the terras beyond my wood for which I am to pay annually the sum of one shillingAm not I man of great worldly importance to purchase ground and take leases thusWhat matters it whether the articles that  secure  the premises to me would also  cover  them or not  My service to Mr Ftwhy will he not come and spend a week with meI think you cannot both be absent at a time  LXIV To Mr GRAVES  The Leasows  Feb  Dear Mr Graves  SINCE I received your letter I have been a week at W I believe I may have told you that I never was fond of that place There is too much trivial elegance too much punctilio for me and perhaps as you express it too much  speculation  But I was fearful I might entirely lose Mr Whistler's acquaintance if I did not make an effort once in five years to return his visit Besides I should have had no hopes of seeing him at The Leasows hereafter and I am extremely desirous of seeing both  him  and  you  here having made many alterations which I do not undertake but with an eye to the approbation of my more generous friends but he seems to my great surprize to renounce the thing called  taste  in buildings gardens c is grown weary of his own little embellishments at W and longs to settle in London for the greater part of his time This I believe he would put in ex∣ecution immediately but that he thinks it might give some uneasiness to his mother if he should quit the house that she with so much dif∣ficulty  obtained for him  I  too am sick of the word  taste  but I think the  thing  itself the only proper  ambition  and the  specific pleasure  of all who have any share in the faculty of imagination I need not mention my reasons you will soon conceive them And however the case be there is one branch of it which so totally en∣grosses the persons with whom I principally con∣verse that I was astonished to hear him speak even with indifference concerning the reigning taste for rural decorations I could ill forbear telling Mr Whistler that he was now  literally  a beau in a bandbox but the freedom might have given more offence than the joke was worth He has improved the place extremely but I do not like his colonnades You know nothing of that kind is tolerable unless regularly ex∣ecuted in stone that is one thing Another is that colonnades are ornaments which will not  bear  to be very  diminutive  Mr whose house only I saw has been at the expence of a large cornice round it in most elaborate brickwork but with regard to his stuccowork  within  doors he is quite  extravagant  I mention these things upon a supposition that you may like to hear  any  thing that regards the place but indeed they are so mighty trifling that I ought to doubt my supposition I supped with Mr P's family once at Mr W's and all was mighty well only I happen to have a violent aversion to cardplaying and at W I think they do nothing  else  So that on account of my ignorance at qua∣drille or any creditable game I was forced to lose my money and two evenings out of my seven at Pope Joan with Mr P's children Mr W to make me amends invited me to breakfast and shewed me your verses I assure you you have no occasion for a better advocate than Mr W whether with regard to his  judgement  or his zeal in behalf of the subject  the verses or the poet I would fain have obtained a copy but he did not care to give one without your commission I hope  you  will oblige me so far I like them very much the subject is genteel and the verses easy and elegant We agreed upon one or two dif∣ferent readings and one stanza that concerns cards should I think be corrected Not that I would have you less severe upon cards nei∣ther I was even glad to find that you g  ve them so little quarter I sometimes thought that Mr W's seeming fondness for them was a kind of  contrecaeur  Be that as it will his ob∣jection to the stanza as well as mine was solely founded on the versification  the sentiment I liked his Latin verses but they do not inter∣fere with your's Send me a copy and confine my use of it by what limitations you please My reigning toy at present is a pocketbook and I glory as much in furnishing it with the verses of my acquaintance as others would with bankbills I did not know when I went to W but I might have heard Mrs G  accused of certain questions touching their law  I mean of forms and ceremonies but I did  not  On the contrary I had the satisfaction of hearing her person her temper and her understanding much commended but this I did not want The delicacy of your taste is equal with me to a thousand commendations Mrs W is really so much altered by her indisposition that I did not know her She talks of going to Bath this seasonI talked of it too and wish it of all earthly things You must know I could not have come to Claverton  instead  of going to W as I did not determine on the expedition at home but at a friend's house where I was betwixt twenty and thirty miles on my way thither Besides I would allow myself more time when I turn my face towards Bath than I could this  winter Your invitation as it is very obliging so it has many concurring circumstances to re∣commend it at this time I want to recover my health which must be recovered by Bath or  nothing  I want to have you read some trifles of mine which must be ratified by you or  no one  but principally and above all do I long to see you my old friend and Mrs G whom I expect you should render my new oneI am obliged for your charitable endeavours to sup∣port my spirits Your company would do it ef∣fectually but scarce any thing less in  winter  Solitary life limited circumstances a phlegma∣tic habit and disagreeable events have given me a melancholy turn that is hardly dissipated by the most serene sky but in a northeast wind is quite intolerable After a long state of this kind upon every access of amusement one is apt to think it is not  right  to be happy that it is one of Wollaston's implicit lies a treating things contrary to what they  deserve  Your situ∣ation at Claverton is admired by most people and if you could connect some little matter in the neighbourhood would be as surely en∣vied  It is now high time to release youThis is not a letter but an olio I desire my compli∣ments to Mrs G and am affectionately and invariably  Yours W SHENSTONE  As I must now use a frank I will send you a few inscriptions your imagination will supply the scenery on which what merit they may have depends There  were  different readings in the first copy of which I beg your opinion  Stanza the first  At least this calm sequester'd shade  Ambition never dares invade  No c  But shuns c  Stanza the second  Hither the plaintive  halcyon hies  Avoiding all the race that flies  My design was only to convey some pleasing ideas of things which though proper to the place a person might not chance to see there once in twenty times Mr Lyttelton and Lady Alyesbury  necessitated  me to give them copies though they probably did it out of complai∣sance only I gave them in the manner I send them you I hope  you  have not entirely dropt your love for rural scenes of which you were once so fond I will allow your taste for me∣dals to preponderateI beg dear Sir you would neglect no  opportunity  of calling on meI will come to Claverton when I can  LXV To a Friend  The Leasows  Sept  Dear Mr G  I AM very sensibly obliged to you for the  diligence  and  expedition  which you have shewn in answering my late request I cannot feel the very  tenderness  of friendship to be at all abated in me by our long separation nor will it at any time be possible I should so long as I receive such testimonies of your usual  kindness  and  ingenu∣ity  I have no sort of exceptions to make against the province in which you were engaged at Cheltenham nor the light in which you ap∣peared What you lost in any ones opinion of your independency you would gain in their idea of your merit genius and learning and then you had all those advantages  par dessu  As to the compliments that were paid to Mrs G you have something of the same sort of reason to be pleased with them that I have to be pleased with those that are given to my place which I consider as naturally possessed of many beauties each of them brought to light and perfected through my own discernment care and cultiva∣tion And then your pleasure ought to be so much greater than mine as you have a nobler subject to enjoyMrs G has too much sense to object against the freedom of this similitude  I cannot help adding a few strokes to your picture of Mrs I think her an extreme∣ly  superficial  femalepedant for after an inter∣val of many years since I first conversed with her at Mr 's I found her conversation turn solely upon the same  topics definitions  and  quota∣tions  I believe I could easily enough have re∣commended myself to a greater degree of her favour but her vanity and affectations are be∣yond what I could bear Your account of is very picturesque and agreeable to the idea I always had of him but I believe that idea was perfected by wh  observations I made when I had some of his company at London There was something accountable enough to me in their burlesquing Mr L's monody He is you know engaged in a party and his poem though an extraordinary fine composition was too tender for the public ear It should have been printed privately and a number of copies dispersed only among their friends and acquain∣tancesbut even so it would have been re∣published  and it was too good to suppress I wish the burlesquers of such  ingenuous  profu∣sions could be punished consistently with English liberty  "Where were ye Muses c"  is imi∣tated from Milton and taken from Milton from Theocritus I write Greek wretchedly but you will remember the passage  I heard once before it was burlesqued under the title of  "An Elegy on the Death of a fa∣vourite Cat"  but the burlesque will die and the poem will surviveYou tell me  "The Author of Peregrine Pickle says if you will flatter Mr Lyttelton well he will at least make you a Middlesex Justice"  and it happened oddly that whilst I was reading your letter a neighbour told me I was put in the commission of the peace I have never receiv∣ed a single line from Mr Whistler and I be∣lieve my journey to W has given the final blow to our friendship Pray was not Mr Blandy some relation of theirs or only their at∣torney The affair is uncommonly shocking and I fancy the  genuine  accounts that Mr W sends you will be curious anecdotes at BathI suppose you have painted your room with oil colours and made it  really  handsomeI drew out a festoon and a medal some time ago for a pan∣nel over Mr P's chimney but they knew not what to make of the medal and had only the festoon executed in stone colour by a com∣mon painteryours is better and in characterI am a degree more frugal than you for I only use quick lime and either blue or yellow  and to take away the objection which I have to whited walls  I paid a visit to Mr Lyttelton the Dean c since he came down but had little of their company for they thought Sir Thomas was dy∣ing however by unparalleled strength of con∣stitution he lingered in violent pain till last Sa∣turday when he died very much lamented He had good natural parts well improved by reading modern writers and by the knowledge of the world extremely prudent considerate humane polite and charitableI have jumb∣led his more obvious qualities together that you may not think I am usurping the province of a newsman Sir George will lose no time in building a new house or doing what is more than  equivalent  to the old one  I want no  temptation  to come immediately to C This is a melancholy  season  with me always whether it be owing to the scenes I see or to the effect of hazy skies upon an illperspiring skinI can say no more at  present  than that I most ardently desire to see you and desire my humble service to Mrs G I have a chalybeat spring in the middle of my grotto what think you of this inscription  FONS FERRVGINEVS  DIVARVM OPTVMAE  SALVTI SACER  Is it antique  I am dear Mr G Your most affectionate W SHENSTONE  LXVI To Mr GRAVES on the Death of Mr SHENSTONE's Brother  The Leasows  Feb  Dear Mr Graves  YOU will be amazed at my long silence and it might reasonably excite some disgust if my days had passed of late in the manner they used to do but I am not the man I was per∣haps I never  shall  be Alas my dearest friend I have lost my only brother and since the fatal close of November I have had neither peace nor respite from agonizing thoughts  You I think have  seen  my brother but per∣haps had no opportunity of distinguishing him from the groupe of others whom we call  goodnatured  men This part of his character was so visible in his countenance that he was generally beloved at sight  I  who must be allowed to know him do assure you that his understanding was no way inferior to his benevolence He had not only a sound judgement but a lively wit and genuine humour As these were many times eclipsed by his native bashfulness so his benevolence only suffered by being shewn to an excess I here mean his giving too indiscrimi∣nately into those jovial meetings of company where the warmth of a social temper is discover∣ed with less reserve but the virtues of his head and heart would soon have shone without alloy The foibles of his youth were wearing off and his affection for me and regard to my advice with his own good sense would soon have rendered him all that I could have wished in a successor I never in my life knew a person more sincere in the expression of love or dislike  But it was the  former  that suited the propensity of his heart the  latter  was as transient as the starts of passion that occasioned it In short with much true genius and real fortitude he was ac∣cording to the  English  acceptation  "a true honest man"  and I think I may also add a truly English character but  "habeo dixi immo  habui  fratrem amicum Chreme"  All this have I  lost  in him He is now in re∣gard to  this  world no more than a mere idea And this idea therefore though deeply tinged with melancholy I must and surely  ought  to cherish and preserve  I believe I wrote you some account of his ill∣ness last spring from which to all appearance he was tolerably well recovered He took the air and visited about with me during the war∣mer months of summer but my pleasure was of short duration  "Haesit lateri lethalis arundo"  The peripneumony under which he laboured in the spring had terminated in an adhesion of the lungs to the pleura so that he could never lie but on his right side and this as the weather grew colder occasioned an obstruction that could never be surmounted  Though my reason forewarned me of the event I was not the more prepared for itLet me not dwell upon itIt is altogether insuppor∣table in  every respect  and my imagination seems more assiduous in educing pain from this occa∣sion than I ever yet found it in administering to my pleasureThis hurts me to no purposeI know it and yet when I have avocated my thoughts and fixed them for a while upon com∣mon amusements I suffer the same sort of con∣sciousness as if I were guilty of a crime Believe me this has been the most sensible affliction I ever felt in my life and you who know my anxiety when I had far less reason to complain will more easily  conceive  it now than I am able to describe it  I cannot pretend to fill up my paper with my usual subjectsI should thank you for your re∣marks upon my poetry but I despise poetry and I might tell you of all my little rural im∣provements but I hate themWhat can I now expect from my solitary rambles through them but a series of melancholy reflections and irk∣some anticipationsEven the pleasure I should take in in shewing them to  you  the greatest they can afford me must be now greatly inferior to what it might formerly have been  How have I prostituted my sorrow on occa∣sions that little concerned me I am ashamed to think of that idle  "Elegy upon Autumn"  when I have so much more important cause to hate and to condemn it  now  but the glare and gaiety of the Spring is what I  principally  dread when I shall find all things restored but my poor bro∣ther and something like those lines of Milton will run for ever in my thoughts  Thus with the year  Seasons  return but not to  me  returns  A brother's cordial smile at eve or morn  I shall then seem to wake from amusements company every  sort  of inebriation with which I have been endeavouring to lull my grief asleep as from a dream and I shall feel as if I were  that instant  despoiled of all I have chiefly valu∣ed for thirty years together of all my present happiness and all my future prospects The melody of birds which he no more must hear the chearful beams of the sun of which he no more must partake  every  wonted pleasure will produce that  sort  of pain to which my temper is most obnoxious Do not consider this as poetryPoetry on such occasions is no more than literal truth In the present case it is  less  for half the tenderness I feel is altogether shapeless and inexpressible  After all the wisdom of the world may per∣haps esteem me a gainer Ill do they judge of this event who think that any shadow of amends can be made for the death of a brother and the disappointment of all my schemes by the accession of some fortune which I never can enjoy  This is a mournful narrative I will not therefore enlarge itAmongst all changes and chances I often think of you and pray there may be no suspicion or jealousy betwixt us dur∣ing the rest of our lives  I am dear Sir most affectionately yours W SHENSTONE  LXVII To C W  Esq  ALAS dear Mr W the terrible event has happened I have lost the best of brothers and you are to pity not to condemn your unfortunate correspondent  About the middle of November I had pre∣pared a letter for you which lies now amongst my papers At that time amidst all my appre∣hensions I had some hopes to support me but before I could send it my situation was greatly altered and the month did not wholly expire till it had effectually rendered me the most wretched of mankind  Thus much it was necessary I should tell you you will pardon me if I do not descend any farther into an account of merit that is lost and of sorrow which is too apt to revive of itself Be assured it is to me a loss which the whole  world cannot compensate and an affliction which the longest time I can live will not be able to erase  You said you would let Master W come and spend a few days with meI beseech you doIt will be some relief to me and God knows I have occasion enough for every assist∣ance than can be drawn from correspondence company or amusement  You Sir I presume proceed in the innocent recreations of your garden and those may at least prove a balance for any small disquiets that attend you If greater ills befal you you have persons near you to alleviate them A wife family visitants male and female friends in abundance and a table sufficiently hospitable to attract even your enemies With me the case is otherwise What I have undergone this win∣ter may you never feel so much as in apprehen∣sion  Believe me my friend affectionately and invariably yours W SHENSTONE  ix Kal March MDCCLII  LXVIII To the same  July  Dear Mr W  I DO not know why I made you a promise of a pretty long letter What I now write will be but a moderate one both in regard to length and stile yet write I must  par maniere d'acquit  and you have brought fourpence expence upon yourself for a parcel of nonsense and to no manner of purpose This is not tautology you  must observe for nonsense sometimes answers very considerable purposesIn love it is elo∣quence itselfIn friendship therefore by all the rules of sound logic you must allow it to be something what I cannot say  "nequeo mons∣trare sentio tantum"  The principal part of a correspondence betwixt two idle men con∣sists in two important enquirieswhat we do and how we do but as all persons ought to give satisfaction before they expect to receive it I am to tell you in the first place that my own health is tolerably good or rather what I must call good being I think much better than it has been this last half yearThen as touching my occupation alas  "Othello's occupation's gone"  I neither read nor write aught besides a few letters and I give myself up entirely to scenes of dissipation lounge at my Lord Dud∣ley's for near a week together make dinners accept of invitations sit up till three o'clock in the morning with young sprightly married wo∣men over white port and  vin de paysans  ramble over my fields issue out orders to my hayma∣kers foretel rain and fair weather enjoy the fragance of hay the cocks and the wind rows admire that universal lawn which is produced by the scythe sometimes inspect and draw mouldings for my carpenters sometimes paper my walls and at other times my cielings do every social office that falls in my way but never seek out for any  "Sed vos quid tandem quae circumvolitas agilis thyma non tu corpus eras sine pectore Non tibi parvum ingenium non incultum est"  In short what do you and how do you dothat is all  Tell my young pupil your son he must by all manner of means send me a Latin letter and if he have any billet in French for Miss Lea at The Grange or even in Hebrew Coptic or  Syriac I will engage it shall be received very graciously Thither am I going to dinner this day and there  "implebor veteris Bacchi pin∣guisque ferinae"  All this looks like extreme jollity but is this the true state of the case or may I not more properly apply the  Spem vultu simulat premit atrum corde dolorem  Accept this scrawl in place of a letter and be∣lieve me  Ever most affectionately yours W SHENSTONE  LXIX To Mr G on the Receipt of his Picture  The Leasows  Oct  Dear Mr G  I AM very unfeignedly ashamed to reflect how long it is since I received your present and how much longer it is since I received your letter I have been resolving to write to you almost daily ever since you left me yet have foolishly enough permitted avocations of infi∣nitely less importance than your correspon∣dence to interfere with my gratitude my in∣terest and my inclination What apology I have to make though no way adequate to my negligence is in short as follows After the receipt of your letter I deferred writing till I could speak of the arrival of your pictureThis did not happen till about a month or five weeks ago when I was embarrassed with masons carvers carpenters and company all at a time And though it were idle enough to say that I  could not find  one  vacant hour for my purpose yet in truth my head was so confused by these multifarious distractions that I could have writ∣ten nothing satisfactory either to  myself  or  you  nothing worth a single  penny  supposing the postage were to cost you no more The work∣men had not  finished my rooms  a minute when Lady Luxborough Mrs Davies and Mr Out∣ing arrived with  five  servants and a  set  of horses to stay with me for some time After a nine days' visit I returned with them to Barrels where I continued for a week and whither by the way I go again with Lord Dudley in about a fortnight's time Other company filled up the interstices of my summer and I hope my dear friend will accept of this apology for so long a chasm of silence during which I have been uniformly at his service and true to that inviolable friendship I shall ever bear him  I proceed now to thank you for the  distinction  you shew me in sending me your picture I do it very sincerely It is assuredly a strong like∣ness as my Lady Luxborough with all her ser∣vants that have  seen you  pronounce as well as I consequently more valuable to a  friend  than a face he does not know though it were one of Raphael's The smile about the mouth is bad as it agrees but ill with the gravity of the eyes and as a smile ever so little  outre  has a bad effect in a picture where it is  constant  though it may be ever so graceful in a person where it is  transitory  However this may be altered when I can meet with a good painter I have no  other  objection but to the prominence of the belly The hair I think is good and the coat and band no way exceptionable I have given it all the advantage I can it has a good light and makes part of an elegant chimneypiece in a genteel though little breakfastroom at the end of my house  Mr Whistler and I are now upon good terms and two or three friendly letters have been in∣terchanged betwixt us He presses me to come to Whitchurch and I  him  to come over to The Leasows but the winter cometh when no man can visitThe dispute is adjusted by  time  whilst we are urging it by  expostulation  No uncommon event in most sublunary projects  Lady Luxborough said very extraordinary things in praise of Mrs G after you left us at Barrels yet I sincerely believe no more than she deserves I took the liberty of shewing her your letter here as it included a compliment to her which I thought particularly genteelShe will always consider you as a person of genius and her friend  During most of this summer wherein I have seen much company either here or at Lord Dudley's I have been almost constantly en∣gaged in one continued scene of  jollity  I en∣deavoured to find  relief  from such sort of dissipa∣tion and when I had once given in to it I was obliged to proceed as they say is the case when persons disguise their face with paint  Mine  was a sort of  painting  applied to my tem∣per  "Spem vultu simulare premere atrum corde dolorem"  And the moment I left it off my soul appeared again all haggard and for∣lorn My company has now deserted me the spleenfogs begin to rise and the  terrible  inci∣dents of last winter revive apace in my memory This is my state of mind while I write you these few lines yet I thank God my health is not much amiss  I did not forget my promise of a box c to Mr G I had a dozen sent me one or two of which I could have liked had they been better  finished  They were of a good oval white enamel with flowers c but horribly gilt and not accurately painted I beg my best ser∣vice  to her and will make a fresh essay My dearest friend accept this awkward letter for the presentIn a few posts I will write againBelieve me yours from the bottom of my soul  W SHENSTONE  I will send you a label for madewine after my own plan It is enamelled with grapes shep∣herd's pipe c The motto VIN BE PAISAN  LXX To Mr JAGO  The Leasows  Nov  Dear Mr Jago  COULD I with convenience mount my horse and ride to Harbury this instant I should much more willingly do so than begin this letter Such terrible events have happened to us since we saw each other last that how∣ever irksome it may be to dwell upon them it is in the same degree unnatural to substitute any subject in their place  I do sincerely forgive your long silence my good friend indeed I do though it gave me uneasiness I hope you do the same by mine I own I could not readily account for the  former  period of yours any otherwise than by supposing that I had said or done something in the levity of my heart which had given you disgust but being conscious to myself of the most sincere regard for you and believing it could never be discredited for any  trivial  inad∣vertencies I remember I continued still in ex∣pectation of a letter and did not dream of writing till such time as I had received one I trusted you would write at  last  and that by all my past endeavours to demonstrate my  friendship  you would believe the  tree  was rooted in my heart whatever irregularity you might observe in the  branches  This was my situation before that dreadful aera which gave me such a shock as to banish my best friends for a time out of my memoryAnd when they recurred as they did the first of any thing I was made acquainted with that deplorable misfortune of yours Believe me I sympathized in  your  affliction notwithstanding my own but alas what comfort could I ad∣minister who had need of every possible assist∣ance to support myself I wrote indeed a few letters with  difficulty  amongst the rest one to my friend Graves but it was to vent my com∣plaintI will send you the letter if you please as it is by far my least painful method of con∣veying you some account of my situation Let it convince you that I could have written nothing at that time which could have been of any ser∣vice to you let it afford you at least a faint sketch of my dearest brother's character but let it not appear an ostentatious display of sorrow of which I am by no means guilty I know but too well that I discovered upon the occasion what some would call an unmanly tenderness but I know also that sorrow upon such subjects as these is very consistent with virtue and with the most absolute resignation to the just decrees of Providence  "Hominis est enim affici dolore  sentire  resistere tamen solatia admittere non solatiis non egere"  PlinyI drank pur∣chased amusements never suffered myself to be a minute without company no matter what so it was but continual At length by an attention to such conversation and such amusements as I could at other times despise I forgot so far as to be chearfulAnd after this the summer through an almost constant succession of lively and agree∣able visitants proved even a scene of jollityIt  was inebriation all though of a mingled nature yet has it maintained a sort of truce with grief till time can assist me more effectually by throwing back the event to a distanceNow indeed that my company have all forsaken me and I am delivered up to winter silence and reflection the incidents of the last year revive apace in my memory and I am even astonished to think of the gaiety of my summer The fatal anniversa∣ry the  "dies quem semper acerbum c"  is beginning to approach and every face of the sky suggests the ideas of last winterYet I find myself chearful in  company  nor would I recom∣mend it to you to be much aloneYou would lay the highest obligation upon me by coming over at this timeI pressed your brother whom I saw at Birmingham to use his influence with you but if you can by no means undertake the journey I will take my speediest opportunity of seeing you at HarburyMr Miller invited me strenuously to meet Dr Lyttelton at his house but I believe my most convenient season will be when my Lord Dudley goes to Barrels for I can but ill bear the pensiveness of a long and lonely expedition After all if you  could  come hither first it would afford me the most entire satisfactionI have been making alterations in my house that would amuse you and have many matters to discourse with you which it would be endless to mention upon paperAdieu my dear friend may your merit be known to some one who has greater  power  to serve you than myself but be assured at the same time that no one loves you better or esteems you more  W SHENSTONE  LXXI To the same  The Leasows  Jan  Dear Mr Jago  ALTHOUGH I have many reasons to urge why I did not write to you before or visit you from Barrels as I fully intended I will venture to wave all particulars till I see you and only assure you in the general that I was never able to write any thing satisfactory or to visit you at that time with any sort of con∣venience  Believe me my good friend if  inclination  might have ruled I had been with you at Har∣bury many weeks ago Sure I am they must be the  cares  of home and not the  pleasures  of it that  ever were  sufficient to detain me during the  winter season  Nor do I think I have an enemy that wishes me more miserable than I have almost constantly found myself ever since the beginning of  it  I cannot even now fix a time when I can see you and perhaps it may be deferred till Mr Miller's place will have received some advan∣tage from the Spring and in that case I would infallibly see my Lord Guildford's but I leave this undetermined and I hope if you  can  wan∣der from home with any kind of satisfaction you will do me the justice to believe that you have no friend alive who will more gladly re∣ceive you than myself  I have papered some rooms this last year and would willingly have you see them before their colours are vanished which I think will un∣avoidably be the case of  one  before a second summer be half concluded  Thus is beauty as uncertain as either fortune or fame  I suppose you have heard there is a citation from Doctors Commons and a writ of  "Ne exeat"  out against Mr W for an intrigue with If you have not be not  precipitate  in spreading the storyThey say he has fled into France on the occasionWhat a shocking affair is this so early in life so extensive so lasting so irremediable in its consequences but  Sic visum Veneri cui placet  impares  Formas  atque  animos  sub juga ahenea  Saevo  mittere cum joco  Your misfortunes and mine incline  us  almost to love  all  people that are miserable but how will the daughters of the Philistines rejoice on the occasion nay almost countenance another's loss of virtue by manifesting their own apparent want of humanity  There is a most admirable piece of allegory on this head in the Female Fables by Brooks if I mistake not to whom the author in his pre∣face acknowledges himself greatly indebted  I am truly sorry to understand how much you are alone I really imagined you were much happier in point of company than myself as you live in a much politer neighbourhood amongst persons of genius learning and huma∣nity And happier you  are  for however I make a shift to scrape some company around me they are such as can affect me with little else besides the spleen  Do not dwell too much on subjects that make you thoughtful superficial amusements are out point till some time hence I am an ill adviser but I prescribe you the methods which I have found most effectual with myself  I have not been forgetful of the task that you enjoined me to give you my observations on the verses which you inclosedI will write  my sentiments on a separate paper Do not punish me with silence and suspence concerning you but write I can ardently desire what I but little deserve being  Your most affectionate friend W S  LXXII To the same  The Leasows  Feb  Dear Mr Jago  I WROTE you some account of myself and inclosed some trivial criticisms in a letter I sent you about a fortnight ago which I hope you have receivedTom comes now to enquire after your health and to bring back my ode to Colonel Lyttelton in regard to which I desire that you will not be sparing of your animadver∣sions I whispered my difficulties to Mr Miller at Hagley how delicate I found the subject and how hard it was to satisfy either myself or others in all which points he agreed with me Nevertheless having twice broke my  promise  of sending a corrected copy to Sir George I was obliged to make my peace by a  fresh  one which I suppose I must of necessity performGive me your whole sentiments hereupon I beseech you in particular and in general as a critic and as a friendThe bad state of spirits which I complained of in my last for a long time to∣gether made me utterly irresolute every thing occasioned me suspence and I did nothing with appetiteThis was owing in a great measure to a slow nervous fever as I have since discovered by many concurrent symptoms It is now I think wearing off by degrees I seem to anti∣cipate  a little of that  "vernal delight"  which Milton mentions and thinks  Able to chase  All sadness but despair  At least I begin to resume my silly clue of hopes and expectations which I know however  will  not guide me to any thing more satisfactory than before  I have read scarce any new books this season Voltaire's new Tragedy was sent me from Lon∣don but what has given me the most amuse∣ment  has  been the  "Lettres de Madame de Maintenon"  You have probably read them already in English and then I need not recom∣mend them The Life of Lord Bolingbroke is entirely his  public  life and the book three parts filled with political remarks  As to  writing  I have not attempted it this year and more nor do I know when I shall againHowever I would be glad to correct that Ode  "To the Dutchess of Somerset"  when once I can find in whose hands it is depo∣sited I was  shewn  a very elegant letter of hers the other day wherein she asks for it with great politeness And as it includes nothing but a love of rural life and such sort of amuse∣ments as she herself approves I shall stand a good chance of having it received with partia∣lity She lives the life of a  religieuse  She has  written  my Lady Luxborough a very serious let∣ter of condolance upon the misfortune in her family and need enough has Lady Luxborough of so unchangeable a friend for sure nothing could have happened to a person in her situation more  specifically  unfortunateMr Reynolds has been at Barrels I hear and has brought her a machine that goes into a coatpocket yet an∣swers the end of  "a jack for boots a readingdesk  a cribbageboard a pair of snuffers a ruler an eighteen inchrule three pair of nutcracks a lemonsqueezer two candlesticks a picquet board and the Lord knows what be∣side"  Can you form an idea of it if you can do you not think it must give me pain to reflect that I myself am useful for  no  sort of pur∣pose when a paltry bit of wood can answer so  many  but indeed whilst it  pretends  to these exploits it performs nothing  well  and therein I agree with it So true it is with regard to me what I told you long ago  Multa praeclara minantem  Vivere nec recte nec suaviter  We have a turnpike bill upon the point of be∣ing brought into the House of Commons it will convey you about half the way betwixt Birmingham and Hales and from thence to Hagley but I trust there will be a  left hand  attraction which will always make you deviate from the strait line  I should be ashamed to reflect how much I have dwelt upon  myself  in this letter but that I seriously approve of egotism in letters and were I  not  to do so I should not have any other subject I have not a single neighbour that is either fraught with politeness literature or in∣telligence much less have I a tide of spirits to set my invention afloat but the less I am able to amuse  you  the more desirous am I of your let∣ters which afford me the truest entertainment even when my spirits are ever so much de∣pressed  That universal chearfulness which is the lot of some people persons that you and I may  envy  at the same time that we  despise  is worth all that either fortune or nature can bestow  I am with entire affection Yours W SHENSTONE  LXXIII To Mr GRAVES  The Leasows  Mar  Dear Mr Graves  I AM vexed to find you have no copy of those versesI must make a fresh enquiry and should they happen to accompany this let∣ter as I fear they will  not  be so good as to assist me all you can in the way of  hints  and  corrections  Corrections of what  is  and hints of what  may be  I do not reckon much upon these verses or the patronage which you mention though the Dutchess is a woman of high reputation and has as much benevolence as any woman upon earth  I do  not  include the design of visiting Bath as a public place I have long since given up such schemes of gaiety and expence I visit  you  and  Mrs Graves  at the least I mean to do so  Inoculatioin is a point on which I never speak a syllable in the way of  pro  or  con  I mean not so as to influence particulars for in the gene∣ral I esteem it both right and salutary and even  right  because we  find  it  salutary  I do not know whether I could not bear the  dishonour  of friends or relations better than their  death  It must afford one no small satisfaction to give them one's affection and assistance under every frailty to which human nature is exposed at least so long as they are true to friendship It is Mr Whistler's opinion as well as mine But Mr 's case is altogether different and I make no question that he thinks as you do up∣on the occasion  Poor Danvers's death affects me more than you would perhaps imagine If you remember I was at M when the scheme of his going abroad was in agitationI think how this event must affect Mrs T whose concern will not  be  lessened  by her long separation from him I dare say he reckoned upon his relations here as his  best estate  whatever he might gain elsewhere and no doubt the hope of retiring amongst them has been a constant spur to his diligenceThe event was always uncertain and has proved at last unfortunate yet as Melmoth says very justly  "The course of human affairs requires that we should act with vigour upon very pre∣carious contingencies"  I desire you would give me a sight of the Latin inscription  I think it was the Gentleman's Magazine in which I was shewn your verses  I have a particular and lively idea of your place though I do not remember to have seen even such  parts  of a scene as I have united to∣gether in my imagination I cannot think other∣wise than that the frontdoor opens here the gardendoor there the stream runs in this place c c  Hac ibat Simois haec est Sigeia tellus  The sight of the place could not impress my imagination more deeply though the impression I  am to  acquire will hardly leave one line of my present one remaining  Cabbagegarden ornée  is very high burlesque and affects the improve∣ments of your friend too nearly  Let me know in what manner Mrs Graves and you are drawn Be as particular as you please  I could not be clear from your letter whether you had received the box or not That toge∣ther with the tallies lay on the table before me while I wrote to you last and went with my letter to BirminghamPray satisfy me directly whether you received themThey are trifles indeed but as they acquit me of my promise they are virtually of consequence  Mr Whistler has not answered a letter which I sent him above two months ago nay I think a quarter of a year  You are richI have only to wish the conti∣nuance of your riches with some diminution of your fatigue And yet the most laborious man in the world is I am fully assured more happy than the  laziest  "The Rival Brothers"  has some of Dr Young's affectations and I question if the moral be ab∣solutely trueat least Mr Addison is in some measure against it but on the whole I think it a noble Tragedy abounding as much with re∣fined sentiments and elevated expressions as  "The Gamester"  and  "The Earl of Essex"  are deficient in  both  My verses are not yet sent to Sir George Lyt∣telton  I  start new difficulties and cannot make them to my mind yet have promised him a copy and disappointed him thrice and can hard∣ly defer it much longer without great offence  I have scarce been twenty yards from home this winter Last night I visited one of my neigh∣bours and what with wine sitting up late a perfect flux of discourse and a return home through the dark found myself  vertiginous  before I was aware Never did Prior's manly descrip∣tion  "I drank I liked it not c"  seem so na∣tural to me as it does today I am absolutely vile in my own sight and I abhor myself in dust and ashes I was  never  so intoxicated as not to know what I said or to talk more non∣sense and yet how many things could I wish unsaid that I let fall last night  We are going to add two new bells to our present set of six to have a turnpikeroad from Hagley to Birmingham through Hales and to emerge a little from our obscurity I am dear Sir with compliments to Mrs Graves  Ever most affectionately yours W SHENSTONE  LXXIV To the same with Observations on Arms Inscriptions c  The Leasows  July  Dear Mr Graves  I SEND you my Ode as I sent it to the Dutchess some weeks ago Why I pitched upon one reading sooner than another I will not now explain nor will I trouble you to make any fresh remarks upon it at present only when you happen to read it over at your leisure if any thing occurs to you that would tend to perfect it I would beg you occasionally to make some memorandums I have not yet received an answer but as I accompanied the verses with a letter I suppose I shall receive one in re∣turn I also added to fill a blank space in my paperbook a poem which I call  "The Vista"  and which you may perhaps recollect how pro∣perly I know not for I had the benefit of no person's  judgement  or advice  Lord Dudley made Mr Dolman a present of a piece of plate a large cup in consideration of his sister's being at Broom about half a year There was on it one supporter awkwardly enough holding up the coronet in his paw and from the coronet proceeded a label with  "amo∣ris ergo Dudley"  I do not know who was the manager or whence he had the inscription but I think from Dr H This is  elegant  and  enough  Nevertheless as there may be some con∣venience in dazzling the eyes of the people where I dwell and as  such  eyes as theirs are not to be dazzled and hardly  struck  by  elegance  alone I chose the method that was most  magni∣ficent  I wish they are not invidious enough to say that  his  arms are engraved there for want of some of my  own  so I would not be long be∣fore their notable suggestionI have truly so  low an opinion of arms since they became pur∣chaseable by money and since the present un∣limited use of them that were I to find a coat to my name in the office which I did not like I would not use it but substitute what was more agreeable yet some  sort  of  right  or  claim  is re∣quisite to satisfy one's delicacy with an opinion of  property  and indeed to fix one's  choice  where one has the whole furniture of the universe for  its  objectAfter all the vulgar are more struck with arms than any thing  "stupet in titulis imaginibus"  and I believe there were near two hundred people gathered round Lady Lux∣borough's landau at Birmingham and declaring her arms to be very  noble  or otherwiseI do not therefore chuse to employ a vulgar  mind  about this matterWere you to go London I should gladly solicit  you  or if you have any friend you could write to in town to search the office for really I have none that I like  for the purpose  It will not cost above a couple of shil∣lingsI will send you a draught of the lid of my standish when it arrivesfor I really do not know what Mr Hylton will put upon it I find he consults with Dr B my Lord's physician  "  De  Dudley"  would run most abominably and  "Baro Dudley"  may be authorized by the fre∣quent practice of MaittaireIf it be inscribed  "Dudley"  alone  I can add the rest if I should hereafter think proper and I wish it may be so  My verses to the Colonel are not yet transcrib∣ed  I think the Latin inscription to your brother very elegant and I should not care to have any part of it omittedI would by all means have this little history of his life perpetuated  "His saltem c"  And were you to put it into English it would be too long for an inscriptionunless you were by means of a printed elegy with notes or any other such method to pro∣duce  the same effect and then you might make the epitaph as short as you pleasedAfter all the  first  method is perhaps as eligible When the affair is nearer a conclusion I should be glad to be of any serviceI will think and write again about it  And now having spoke to such matters as have been the subject of our late correspondence I am at liberty to diversify my letter as I mayI should be glad to know in your next whether you have heard of late from Mr Whistler and whether he is confined at home as usual by his mother's state of health I almost despair of ever seeing him again at The Leasows though there is hardly any pleasure I so much covet as that of surprizing him with the  alterations  I have  made  and the  articles  I have  purchased  during the five years since he was in Shropshire add to this the several  acquaintances  I have formed which he would like and the amusing visits I could pay hereabouts with freedomI do not know whether you saw Mr Davenport and his family at Bath this spring He is laying out his environs and I am by appointment to go over the week after next He has also a painter at this time taking views round his house which is one of the most magnificent in our country yet I never leave home but with reluctanceI real∣ly  love  no PLACE so well and it is a great favour in me to allot any one a week of my  summer  Add to this that my constitution requires nur∣sing and I am most  happy  where I am most  free  It is in vain to say they  allow  you all freedom where you cannot allow it  yourself  For this reason I never more enjoy myself than I do at The Grange and yet this to some may appear paradoxical  I yesterday embellished my chalybeate springThe inscription that is  out  on the stone is as follows viz  FONS FERRVGINEVS  DIVAE QVAE SECRSSV ISTO  FRVI CONCEDIT  SALVTI S  Yet I question whether some of the following be not preferable if they are I beg you will tell me One shilling and sixpence produces the alteration  FONS FERRVGINEVS  DIVAE PER QUAM LICET  HOC SECESSV FRVI c  SAL c  or  DIVAE PER QVAM LATEBRAE  QUAEVIS OBLECTANT  c  or  DIVAE LOCORVM OMNIVM

to Mrs Graves  Your most obligde and most affectionate servant W SHENSTONE  LXXV To Mr JAGO  The Leasows  Jan  Dear Mr Jago  I AM at a loss how to begin this letterI will not however after the usual way give you a tedious list of  apologies  in the front of it Some account of my long silence you will find dispersed throughout the letter and as for what is deficient I will depend upon your friendship  There has not been a person here since you left me of whom I could obtain the least in∣telligence concerning you And as an enquiry by the post was my only obvious method I do acknowledge myself to blame notwithstanding all the excuses that I can make  Amidst the conflux of visitants whom I re∣ceived this season I was hardly once  so  happy as I was in  your  company I was the happier in seeing  you  so and if you remember I took notice at the time how little your vivacity was impaired in comparison of my own If I was  then  but a dull  companion  guess whether solitude and winter were likely to make me a better  cor∣respondent  That vein of gaiety and humour which you were once so partial as to discover in my letters will scarce appear there any more not even to the eyes of the most partial friend I have Should you deny what I assert and im∣pute it to a fit of spleen yet you may  allow  that it will scarce enliven any letter that I write in  winter  Friendship still remains Friendship like the root of some perennial flower even  then  perhaps gathers strength in secret that it may afford a better display of its colours in the spring  I do not pretend this to be an adequate apo∣logy I know my dearest friend that you both  like  to see and hear from me it proves however  that you have no great  loss  either of my letters or my company  I am as the phrase is deeply penetrated by the civilities of your Mr Miller He took a short dinner with me once this season dropping Sir George at Mr P'sHe could not have pleased me betterHere he happened to meet Mr Lyttelton and Captain Whood He after∣wards breakfasted here and in general seemed glad of every occasion to bring me the genteelest company To him I owe Miss Banks and Lord Temple Can you think that Radway now as well as Harbury has no attractions for me You know me too well but I have not truly such a state of health as to dare to be from home Friends will say  "you may be as free at our houses as your own c"  and they will  mean  as they  say  but if you cannot make  yourself  so what is all this to the purpose  I cannot give you a detail of what has passed with me since I saw you Lord Dudley with myself made one visit to Lord Plymouth's We met Mr and Mrs WinningtonWe took a trip to Mr Vernon's where we found Mr Coventry and other company The impressions I received from them would afford subject for  conversation  betwixt you and me but I must not assign too much of my paper to that pur∣pose  Lord Plymouth's piece of water should have been a serpentine river I could give you strong reasonsI think my Lord such a character as will make a reputable figure in life  beloved  he  is  and  must  be at first sightLady Plymouth is the most amiable of women and of all the world the properest person that my Lord could have chosen The plan for their house I think right supposing it right to continue it where it is The park is capable of some considerable beauties Lord Plymouth has been once here  since and talks of causing me to come and design for his environsI seem to be highly in his favourI hope some time to meet you there  My Ode after an astonishing delay was pre∣sented to the Dutchess of SomersetIt produced me two genteel letters from her Grace I am well satisfied with the event for some reasons which I will one day give younone of mo∣mentSoon after this Dodsley pressed me to contribute as amply as I pleased to a fourth volume of his Miscellanies I at first meant to do so pretty largely I then changed my mind and sent only some little pieces Part of these were my own part Mr Whistler's Mr Graves's and some accidental pieces of others which I found in my bureauI purposed to send something of yours too of  myself  if I was  hurried  else not without your consent What I thought of was your Linnets Last week he writes me word that the town will now be too much engrossed by the business of elections and that he does not proceed this winterSo that we shall now you see have time to meet or write upon the subject  Mr Graves sent me the enclosed little fable for Dodsley if I approved itI made some al∣terations and sent itReturn it to me if you pleaseIt is pretty but the inscription must be  "To a Friend"  Some correspondence I have had this winter with Mr Hylton about toys and trinkets which he gets done for me in London He is by far a better  friend  and  correspondent  than a  poet  Should you take a trip to town he would be quite  proud  to see you  I am now like the rest of the world peru∣sing Sir Charles GrandisonI know not whe∣ther that world  joins  me in preferring Clarissa The author wants the art of  abridgement  in every  thing that he has written yet I am much his admirer  My dear friend cherish and preserve your own vivacity and let not this phlegmatic epistle impair it If occasion offers call on me for my  own  sake and believe you have not alive a more affectionate friend  W SHENSTONE  LXXVI To Mr GRAVES on the Alterna∣tions of Pleasure and Pain  The Leasows  April  Dear Mr Graves  IT is a long long time according to the com∣putation of friendship since I had the plea∣sure of a line from you and I write chiefly to remind you of it not with any hopes of af∣fording you the amusement of a single minute In truth I have not spirits for it The severity the duration the solitude of this winter have wellnigh exhausted themThe succession the regular succession of pain and pleasure becomes every day more clear to me It begins to seem as ordinary as the course of day and night Thus my last summer was the most amusing I ever saw my winter the most disagreeable Allow me to accept one only I mean that evermourn∣ful winter which robbed me of my dearest rela∣tion Sometimes this pain and pleasure are contrasted within the compass of a day Some∣times in different weeks c c However do not think me superstitious There is hardly a person that is  less  so Yet I am firmly persuad∣ed of the alternation either in the mind or in the events themselves My summer I said be∣fore was highly entertaining my winter render∣ed  equally disagreeable by a longcontinued squabble amongst our principal parishioners and by the death of my bestbeloved and the most accomplished of my relations M D She risqued going to London for the sake of finding something  new  was seized with the smallpox and died in all her bloomThe natural conse∣quence which we should draw from observations of this sort is equanimity  "aequam memento rebus c"  and again  "sperat infestis me∣tuit secundis c"  Enough of this which I should not mention but that the fact itself strikes me continually more and more and were I to mark the pleasing and unpleasing parts of my existence in an almanac as the Romans did their  Fasti  and  Nefasti  I know not if at the year's end the black and white marks would not nearly balance each other  I have bought Hogarth's Analysis it is really entertaining and has in some measure ad∣justed my notions with regard to beauty in ge∣neral For instance were I to draw a shield I could give you reasons from hence why the shape was pleasing or disagreeable I would have you  borrow  and read it  Grandison I cannot think equal to Clarissa though were merit in this age to be preferred the author of it deserves a bishoprick  Jago has been fortunate for once but the value of his livings must be exaggerated in the newspapers  If Mr Whistler would give me a visit in the height of my season this year I would look upon it as one of the most pleasing events that could happen to the remainder of my life and I would not presume to hope that fate would ever allow me a repetition of it  My love of toys is not quite exhaustedI have purchased or rather renovated some that are both rich and beautiful though short of  what I meant them I have amused myself with designing little ornaments this winter some of which may turn to account under the manage∣ment of some Birmingham mechanicTo at∣chieve  ease  in that season is the most that I can  hope  and it is more than I often  obtain  Excuse this worthless letter which  must  cost you money as they tell me franks are useless I could not avoid some uneasiness upon reflect∣ing how long you have been silent Present my best compliments to Mrs Graves and pay a tribute of one single halfsheet to that affection with which I am ever  Yours W SHENSTONE  LXXVII To the same on the Death of Mr WHISTLER  The Leasows  June  Dear Mr Graves  THE melancholy account of our dear friend Whistler's death was conveyed to me at the same instant by yours and by his brother's letter I have written to his brother this post though I am very ill able to write upon the subject and would willingly have waved it longer but for decency The trium∣virate which was the greatest happiness and the greatest pride of my life is broken The fabric of an ingenuous and disinterested friendship has lost a noble column yet it may and  will  I trust endure till one of us be laid as low In truth one can so little satisfy one's self with what we say upon such sad occasions that I made three or  four essays before I could  endure  what I had writ∣ten to his brotherBe so good as to excuse me to him as well as you can and establish me in the good opinion of him and Mr Walker  Poor Mr Whistler how do all our little strifes and bickerments appear to us at this time yet we may with comfort reflect that they were not of a  sort  that touched the  vitals  of our friendship and I may say that we fondly loved and esteemed each other of ne∣cessity  "Tales animas  oportuit  esse concordes"  Poor Mr Whistler not a single acquaintance have I made not a single picture or curiosity have I purchased not a single embellishment have I given to my place since he was last here but I have had his approbation and his amusement in my eye I will assuredly inscribe my larger urn to his memory nor shall I pass it without a pleasing melancholy during the remainder of my days We have each of us received a plea∣sure from  his  conversation which no other conversation can afford us at our present time of life  Adieu my dear friend may our remem∣brance of the person we have lost be the strong and everlasting cement of our affection Assure Mr John Whistler of the regard I have for him upon his  own  account as well as his brother's Write to me directly if you have opportunity Whether you have or no believe me to be ever most affectionately yours  W SHENSTONE  I beg my compliments to Mrs Graves  LXXVIII To the same  The Leasows  July  Dear Mr Graves  THE  particulars  relating to our poor friend's departure occasioned me much concern and indeed some tears yet as  those  particulars are what one covets to hear and the melan∣choly which they produce is never unmixed with pleasure I think myself much obliged to you for the care you took to convey them It is possible the letters I wrote to you and Mr J Whistler might appear too tender from a  mere  friend of the deceased but there is a sympathy betwixt friends which is not always found amongst relations nor does  kindred  imply  friend∣ship  a whit more than  friendship  does  kindred  It is not many weeks ago that I had a bill filed against me in Chancery by young D the only near relation I have by the mother's side and the next in lineal succession to my share of the Penn's estateDo not let this surprize you I believe the affair will be accommodatedHe only wanted to procure a division of the Harbo∣rough estate at a large expence which might be better adjusted without  any  in other words to run his head against a stonewall that he might have a chance of causing it to tumble upon  me  Would you consent that I should suffer him to have the mansionhouse at Harborough thrown into his lot Were I so to do I could make it advantageous to myself and the dispute were at an end but I have a kind of romantic venera∣tion for that  place  and  family  which if you re∣member I have expressed in one of my best elegies  Elegy xv    Pray what will become of our letters to Mr Whistler as I am not conscious of any thing dishonourable in mine and I am  sure  I may say the same of yours methinks I could wish that they might not be destroyed It is from a few letters of my own or others alone acciden∣tally preserved that I am able to recollect what I have been doing since I was born  I met when I was last at Barrels a surgeon of Bath whose name I think was Cleland He knew your name and place but I find was not personally acquainted with youI am glad enough to hear that your place gets into vogue It is I think what you should  chuse  upon all accounts Let the beauty of the place guide them to the merits of its  owner  I have often thought myself that were a person to live at The Leasows of more merit than myself and a few degrees more worldly prudence he could scarce want opportunities to procure his own ad∣vancement My rural embellishments are per∣haps more considerable than yours but then the vicinity of Bath might occasion you a greater confluxYour unexpensive illuminations please me highlyI have purposed these many years to purchase a set of tin lamps of about fourpence apiece to stick against trees and to use upon occasion in my coppice or rather in my grove where some of the waterfalls would not fail to shew delightfully  You asked me about Jago's preferment The living  last given  him by the Bishop of Worcester is I believe near an hundred pounds a yearWith this he has Harbury of about fifty and Cheslerton a sort of chapel of ease about forty in the  whole  therefore about a hundred and ninety but then he is obliged to keep a curate and what I think yet worse is that he cannot make it  convenient  to  live  at his new situation which is a pretty one  I have had some visitants this season indeed as many and as considerable as such a sort of season could afford me A Scotch peer called upon me in his way through Birmingham his title was He seemed to have a very clear head a very polite and easy manner and all the refinement of true taste  without  the warmth or appetiteI could not help thinking him on many accounts characteristic of the Scottish na∣tion  Would to God I could see you and Mrs Graves here this summer I have the same wish it may be  my  lot to visit  you  next autumn Be assured I  purpose  it  I expect Dodsley every week He will I am convinced be for publishing his Miscellany next winter Would Mr W think you agree that you and I should be allowed to publish such of poor Mr Whistler's papers there as we judged were most likely to do credit to his memory  Adieu dear Mr Graves Let us reconcile our affections to the ordinary events of life and let us adopt my friend Jago into our second triumvirate I am however always with  pe∣culiar  attachment yours  W SHENSTONE  My best compliments to Mrs Graves  P S Since I wrote the foregoing I have had Mr Davenport of Davenporthouse with all his familyHis brother the clergyman remem∣bered you by your pictureHis wife is the finest  person  c I have seen here except Lady Ayles∣buryingenious easybehaved and of an ex∣cellent temperThey come to Bath in a fort∣night  Since that time Sir George Lyttelton Mr Lyttelton and Miss Lyttelton Sir George  thinks some alterations requisite in my verses to which I cannot bring myself easily to conformbut must  I look upon my scheme of embellishing my farm as the only lucky one I ever pursued in my lifeMy place now brings the world home to me when I have too much indolence to go forth in quest of it  LXIX To the same on hearing that his Letters to Mr  Whistler  were destroyed  The Leasows  Oct  Dear Mr Graves  IT is certainly some argument of a  peculiarity  in the esteem I bear you that I feel a readiness to acquaint you with  more  of my foibles than I care to trust with any other person I believe no∣thing shews us more plainly either the different  degrees  or  kinds  of regard that we entertain for our several friends I may also add the  difference  of their  characters  than the ordinary style and tenour of the letters we address to them  I confess to  you  that I am considerably morti∣fied by Mr John W's conduct in regard to my letters to his brother and rather than they should have been so unneccessarily destroyed would have given more money than is allowable for me to mention with  decency  I look upon my letters as some of  my  chefd'oeuvres and could I be supposed to have the least pretensions to propriety of style or sentiment I should ima∣gine it must appear principally in my letters to his brother and one or two more friends I considered them as the records of a  friendship  that will be always  dear  to me and as the  history  of my  mind  for these twenty years last past The amusement I should have found in the perusal of  them would have been altogether innocent and I would gladly have preserved them if it were only to explain those which I shall preserve of his brother's Why he should allow either  me  or  them  so very little weight as not to  consult  me with regard to them I can by no means conceive I suppose it is not  uncustomary  to return them to the surviving friend I had no answer to the letter which I wrote Mr J W I received a ring from him but as I thought it an inadequate memorial of the friendship which his brother had for me I gave it to my servant the moment I received it at the same time I have a neat standish on which I caused the lines Mr W left with it to be inscribed and which appears to me a much more agreeable remembrancer  I have read your new production with plea∣sure and as this letter begins with a confession of foibles I will own that through mere lazi∣ness I have sent you back your copy in which I have made some erasements instead of giving you my reasons on which those erasements were founded Truth is it seems to me to want mighty few variations from what is now the present text and that upon one more perusal you will be able to give it as much perfection as you mean it to have And yet did I suppose you would insert it in Dodsley's Collection as I see no reason you have to the contrary I would take any pains about it that you should desire me I must beg another copy at your leisure  I should like the inscription you mention upon a real stoneurn which you purchase very rea∣sonable at Bath but you must not risque it up∣on the vase you mention on any account what∣ever  Now I mention Bath I must acquaint you that I have received intelligence from the younger Dodsley that his brother is now there and that  none of the papers I sent him are yet  sent to press  that he expects his brother home about the fourth or fifth of November when he proceeds with his publication Possibly you may go to Bath whilst he is there and if so may chuse to have an interview  I shall send two or three little pieces of my own in hopes that you will adjust the reading and return them as soon as you conveniently can All I can send tonight is this  "Ode to Memory"  I shall in the last place desire your opinion as to the manner of  placing  what is sent The first pages of his Miscellany must be already fixed I think to propose ours for the last but as to the  order  it will depend entirely upon you  Adieu in other words God bless youI have company at the table all the time I am writing  Your ever most affectionate W SHENSTONE  LXXX To Mr JAGO  The Leasows  June  Dear Mr Jago  WERE I to pronounce my sentence upon the long suspension of our correspon∣dence I should impute the blame of it in al∣most  equal  measure to  yourself  and to  me  To  you  for an omission of the letter you  promised  me when last in town to me for waiting in ex∣pectation of it and for neglecting to do  justice  to the sentiments of my heart on the occasion of your late preferment Great were the hopes I had indeed conceived that your increase of re∣venue had been accompanied with a place of re∣sidence which was more  to your mind  than that  where you at present abide but I do not find by any accounts that you purpose to leave Har∣bury for which no doubt you have reasons which I do not yet penetrate but which may demand my assent the moment you discover them I have but little to say of the life I have led since you received some account of me from Mr Hyl∣ton in London The Winter or at least its  mi∣nisters  continued to tyrannize during the  minority  of Spring and the Spring has alike been slow in giving up the reins to Summer Of conse∣quence I seem in a sort of middle state betwixt a dull halfanimated grub and an insignificant locomotive fly Neither in the  one  state or  other  am I of the least importance but from the ad∣vances which I have  already  made you are  some∣what  the more likely to find me in your garden About a fortnight ago I received a line or two from our intimate acquaintance and schoolfel∣low Mr Hall It was brought me by Sir Ed∣ward Boughton's gardener a fellow of good taste to whom Mr Hall desired I would cause The Leasows to be shewn I find you have de∣lighted Mrs Hall by some alterations which you propose for their environs and which they tho∣roughly resolve to put in execution When I come over into Warwickshire as I hope to do soon I shall be very glad to make them a visit in your company My spirits though far from good are better in the main than they were in winter and on some peculiar days are raised as high as to  alacrity very  seldom higher sel∣dom so high  You must from hence at least take matters in the order or rather  disorder  in which they occur Mr Miller I saw on Wednesday last in Lady Lyttelton's coach who stopped two minutes at my gate on her return from London I enquired concerning you but could gather no intelligenceMr Hylton who is now in Warwickshire if  he have not strolled to London has been with me several months this summer He is adding a room or two to his place which lies very near me and purposes to reside there as soon as it is finished The situation is not void of beauties but if you will pardon the vanity must veil its bonnet to mine I have heard of planting hollies pyracanthas and other berrybearing greens to attract those Blackbirds which you have so ef∣fectually celebrated it shall be  my  ambition to plant good neighbours and what with Lord Dudley and his exotics Mr Hylton with his fossils and myself with my  ferme ornée  is there not some room to expect that we may attract the tasters this way but first we must take some care to  advertise  them where their treasures lieAnother day is passed and Mr Miller c has again been with me and waked me out of a sound sleep to breakfastHe mentions with what reluctance he  left  a surveyor at Radway em∣ployed in taking plans of the field of battle near Edgehill This he purposes to enrich with a number of anecdotes gleaned from his neighbourhood which must probably render it extremely entertaining and surely Edgebill fight was never more unfortunate to the nation than it was lucky for Mr Miller He prints to∣gether with this plan another sheet of Radway Castle I approve his design He will by these means turn every bank and hillock of his estate there if not into  classical  at least into  historical  ground  I have done mighty little about my grounds since last winter As indolence has on  many  oc∣casions contributed to  impair  my finances it is but just that it should sometimes contribute to  restore  them Yet I am not quite destitute of something new for your amusement  Of late I have neither  read  nor  written  a syl∣lable What pleased me last was Hogarth's Ana∣lysis  I expect Dodsley down every week and as he will spend a few days with me I could wish you were to meet him His genius is truly poetical and his sentiments altogether liberal and ingenuous  I am at present a surveyor of roads em∣ployed in repairing my lane to the turnpikeHow glad should I be to meet you and to shew you its  beauties  to shew you Mr Hylton's new series of coins his  designs  as well as his  per∣formances  at Lappahow glad should I be to see you yea I would hardly fail to return with you to Harbury were you to add this one obligation I left Mr Miller in doubt whether he would not see me at Radway some time next week Evil and capricious health the particu∣lars of which would make a detail of no im∣portance destroys all my punctuality and bids me promise with  fear  You I trust are mostly at home and were you to be at Snitterfield I would follow you without reluctance So with hopes to see you shortly either in Warwick∣shire or Shropshire I relinquish the subject  I have reserved a very melancholy subject for the last May you and Mr Graves and myself stand firm to support the fabric of friendship which has lost a very beautiful column in poor Mr Whistler he died of a sore throat which in a few days time turned to an inward mortifi∣cationI will say no more on the occasion very affecting has it been to meGod preserve your life your happiness and your friendships and may you ever be  assured  of  that  with which I am dear Sir  Your most affectionate humble servant W SHENSTONE  Shall I beg a line from you as soon as may beI do most earnestly  I am given to understand that I may expect a visit this summer from the Bishop of Worcester from Lord Ward Lord Coventry and Lord GuernseyIt may be so but honours of  this sort  which would formerly have affected me perhaps  too  deeply have now lost much of their wonted poignancy Can  such  persons bear to see the scenes  riant  and to find the  owner  gloo∣my Let  them  as they are  able  make my cir∣cumstances more affluent and they shall find the  reflection  in  my  face and in  their  reception but as this will never be it is no compliment to declare that an hour or two's interview with you or Mr Graves outweighs the arrival of the whole British Peerage  Something else I have to say Young Pixell last winter told me that the organist of Wor∣cester had set your Ode The Blackbirds to music that he  liked  the music and that he would sing it next evening at the Birmingham concert I have not heard him mention it  since  and I  forgot  to enquire but if you happen to have the notes I should be glad if you would inclose them for me  I have been of late much bent upon the encrease of  horns  in this neighbourhoodDo not interpret me  perversely  I mean French horns only My Lord Dudley has had a person to teach two of his servantsnothingat my in∣stigation but your old acquaintance Maurice  who lives at the corner of my coppice  will exceed him in a week by means of a good ear I have borrowed a horn for him Adieu  LXXXI To C W  Esq  July  Dear Mr W  YOU do me justice in believing that I am truly sorry you have not been well A degree or two of regularity more than what you have already will I fancy restore your health and my satisfaction and I beg you will afford me the earliest account of your recovery  I considered Master W's visit as an abso∣lute engagement and remained at home in con∣stant expectation of him for a fortnight togetherI am however not sorry for his own sake that he is gone to Oxford especially as you seem to have an assurance of its proving advantage∣ous Pray assure him of my earnest wishes for his happiness and that The Leasowes will be al∣ways at his service whenever through the fickleness of human nature he thinks proper to give up a Muse for a Waternymph  I expect Mr Hylton dailyHe was last week in London and is now I believe at CoventryHe will probably visit you before he comes in∣to this countryHe talked of it when he left meI am obliged to be brief  Postwoman waits for me  "multa gemens"  Dodsley is the man for your purposeHe has with good genius a liberal turn of mindI ex∣pect him to spend a few days here every weekI will if he return through Warwickshire occasion him to call upon you but you know he is often lame with the gout and will hardly be able to make any long digression  Your case is exactly mine You say you can∣not bear wrongs with patience but you can sleep and  forget  themSo can Iso do IDid I never tell you if not I do so now that indo∣lence in a thousand instances give one all  the advantages of philosophy and pray if you call me lazy any more take care that you do not use an expression by way of disparagement which I consider as the highest honour I am a fool however for discovering my secret What a number of compliments might you have made me unwittingly  Tacitus pasci si posset corvus haberet  Plus dapis rixae minus invidiaeque  Had I time I could comfort you under your illusage by discovering to you the similitude of my own situation  Excuse this scrawl accept my compliments carry them to Mrs and Miss W and believe me ever your obliged and most obedient humble servant  W SHENSTONE  LXXII To Mr JAGO on their contribution to  Dodsley's  Miscellanies  The Leasowes  Jan  Dear Mr Jago  I AM sure you must be puzzled how to ac∣count for my silence after the honour you have done me by your verses and the request you made that I would  write  I am also as much at a loss how to give a proper weight to my apology To say I have been ill would per∣haps imply too much when I would only al∣lude to that state of heaviness and dejection which is so frequently my lot at this time of the year and which renders me both  averse  to writ∣ing and utterly dissatisfied with every thing that I  do  write  IF at any time my head grew a little less con∣fused than ordinary I was obliged to devote my attention to the affair in which I had so  foolishly  involved myself with Dodsley You are unable to conceive what vexation it has given me I could not endure to  disappoint  him of conse∣quence it has been my lot to study the delica∣cies of  poetry  when my brain was not sufficient to indite a piece of common prose but as the  Mouse  by which I mean my  own  performances will so soon make its ridiculous appearance it were totally impolitic in me to expatiate on the labours of the  Mountain  The first letter I re∣ceived from you left me greatly dissatisfied I was then to send D my  final  instructions in a post or twoYou took little notice of any query I made and intimated a disapprobation which agreed  too well  with my own internal sen∣timents I knew not but you were  angry  at the  liberties  I had taken though I could have sup∣pressed any single paper which I had then con∣veyed to LondonLittle did I  then  imagine that it was in my power to have protracted the affair till  now  Had that been the case I should have troubled you with repeated embassies for I abhor the tediousness of the post and my ser∣vants do little at this time of the year that is of more importance than their master's poetry  Your next letter convinced me that you had taken no offence and so far I was happy but then I wanted to have your Goldfinches as cor∣rect as your Blackbirds there were  some  things I wished you to alter and others in regard to which I was desirous to speak my  sentiments  Add to this my own  verses  with which I was in∣finitely  more  dissatisfied Why then did I not writeThe true reason was that I was pressed by D to send conclusions every post and though I have had all this leisure as it  happens  since you wrote I never could  depend  upon  more than the space of a day or two Besides criticisms in the way of letter are extremely te∣dious and dissatisfactory insomuch that I am thoroughly determined never to print any thing for the future unless I have the company of my friends when I send to the press Hur∣ried as I then was I sent up your two copies and what I proposed for him of my own with a kind of  discretionary  power to select the best readings How you would approve of this measure I knew not but I had this to plead in my behalf that D was a person of taste  himself  that he had as I imagined many learned friends to assist him that his  interest  was concerned in the per∣fection of his Miscellany and that I submitted my own pieces to the same judgement  After all I am but indifferently satisfied with the present state of these contributions D writes just so much as he deems  necessary  in the way of business and passes by a thousand points in my letters which deserve an answer His last acquaints me that he has spent a whole day in the arrangement of what I have sent him and that he purposes to send me  proofsheets  before the close of this week desiring I would send them back by the return of the post Whether they arrive on Saturday or on Monday I can keep them till the Thursday following  And this brings me in the last place to the main purpose of this letterIt is a request on which I lay great stress and which you must not refuse me upon almost any considerationI beg in short that you would promise me the favour of your company on Monday or even Tuesday next if possible and let us jointly fix the readings of  your  pieces of my  own  and those of our common  friends  You will immediately comprehend the  expediency  of this now in par∣ticular that our names are to appear  Some  alterations I think  necessary  in your Goldfinches  and there are two or three stanzas which I think you might improveNevertheless I will not pretend that this journey is so  requisite  upon your  own  account as  mine  and will recommend it upon no other footing than the pleasure you will receive by the obligation which you will confer  I thought to have concluded here but as an envelope is now become altogether necessary have a temptation to proceed which I did not see before  It is now become Friday the twentyfourth of January The packets I send and the request that I make upon so  little  warning will at first astonish youUnforeseen interruptions would not suffer me to dispatch my courier soonerWhat then remains but that I endeavour to ad∣just this affair agreeably to its  present  circum∣stances  You will readily conceive from what you ob∣serve in my packets how desireable your com∣pany is to me at this juncture Supposing it then in your  power  to come over on Monday Tuesday or even Wednesday I am inclined to believe you  will  Supposing it  not  so I can foresee you will not have leisure to satisfy my queries by the return of the bearer and what I would  next  propose is that you would either suffer me to send again to you betwixt this time and Thursday next or that you would yourself dispatch a purposemessenger and allow me to pay for his journeyIn either of these  latter  cases I am sure you so well know the nature of my present irresolution that you will endeavour to afford me all the assistance you are able  Adieu my dear friend and depend upon my best services on every possible occasion  I am ever your most affectionate and most obedient servant W SHENSTONE  LXXXIII To the same on the same Subject  The Leasows  Feb  Dear Mr Jago  I RECEIVED a letter from Dodsley dated the fifteenth of February informing me that you were then in town had been with him and left your directions whether he might send you a set of Miscellanies  February the twentieth and not  before  arrived young H with your letter very obliging∣ly intended to give me previous notice of your journey but which by the iniquity of chance tended only to acquaint me with an opportunity which I had  lost  There is nothing could have been so fortunate as your journey to London had Mr H thought proper to bring your letter in due timeWhat excuse he made for his neglect or whether he made any I have really forgot This I know that the whole affair has been unlucky There has been abundant time for consultation and a perfect series of opportunities of which we have not been suffered to avail ourselvesIt is now three weeks or a month since I corrected the proofsheets was so hurried in the doing of it that I scarce knew what I wrote and yet in spite of all this hurry the book is hitherto un∣published  Now  indeed it must be much too late for alterations as D has given me some room to expect a book this very dayI know but little what he has done in consequence of that discretionary power with which I through haste was obliged to intrust him but in what I have done  myself  you may expect to find all the effects of  dulness precipitated  It is now the twentythird of February and I have received no fresh account of our friend  Dodsley's proceedings nor am I able to  trace  them as I expected in the newspapers  As to your share of this Miscellany you can have no cause to be dissatisfiedAfter what manner he has thought proper to print Lady L's verses I am a good deal uncertain but I apprehend he has not followed her own read∣ings very precisely and that the blame thereof is to be thrown upon meI am concerned for the memory of my poor friend Whistler and regret that his  better  pieces did not fall into my hands I think that Dodsley however would have done him greater justice had he inserted his translation of  "Horace and Lydia"  It is true the translations of that Ode are out of num∣ber but  his  if I mistake not had many beau∣ties of its ownI do not know whether I ever hinted to you that  his  genius and that of Ovid were apparently congenialHad he cultivated his with equal care perhaps the similitude had been as obvious as that of your twindaughtersMr Graves has one small wellpolished gem in this collection his verses upon medalsHis little conjugal Lovesong is also natural and easyI  told  you what I least disliked of my  own  puerilitiesIf the printing of my Rural Inscrip∣tions be  invidious  it was altogether owing to the instigation of Sir G L There are four or five little matters which if he have printed with my name incorrect as they are I shall be utterly disconsolate at least till I get sight of a succeeding impressionFor though I am not much solicitous about a poetical reputation and indeed it is of little importance to so  domestic  an animal as myself yet I could ill endure to pass for an affected powerless  pretender  And now no more upon the subjectI have nothing to add that can the least amuse youYou who have been conversant with all the busy and the splendid scenes of life can want  no materials to make a letter entertainingIn∣deed you never  did  I shall be glad however to receive a  long  one upon what subjects you please  I have passed a very dull and unamusive win∣ter my health indeed rather better than I experi∣enced it last year but my head  as  confused and my spirits  as  low I live in hopes of an opportunity of seeing you at Harbury but I begin now to re∣ceive visits as an honest beggar does an alms with my humblest thanks for the favour and with a despair of making a return  Perhaps my next letter may discover some∣what more  resolution  inclinations I never want being at all times with singular affection yours  W SHENSTONE  LXXXIV To the same  The Leasowes  April  Dear Mr Jago  I HAVE so long expected the favour of a few lines from you that I begin at last to question whether you received the letter I sent you It was inclosed in one to Mr M whom I requested to further it with all conve∣nient expedition I am neither able to recollect the whole contents of it nor indeed if I  were  could I endure the thoughts of transcribing them The chief intention of it however was to ac∣quaint you of Mr H's unhappy delay in the delivery of that letter with which you favoured me from Radway  What confirms me in a suspicion that my last letter miscarried is that Mr Wren lately ac∣quainted me of your being at Wroxall upon bu∣siness and of your making some slight mention  of Mr Dodsley's publication without intimat∣ing that you discovered any design you had of writing to me This is mere preamble and stuff implying nothing more than the desire I have to  hear  from you when it ought also to express how impatiently I long to  see  you Worldly concerns and my winterly state of health have detained me at home for these many months past world∣ly concerns may have confined you likewise but as your health and spirits are universally better than mine and as you have much less dislike to travelling than myself I would hope that my absence from Harbury will never cause you to  neglect  any  opportunity  of coming hither For my own part I have been meditating upon a visit to you all this winter and do at this time resolve most strenuously to perform it before June But the many such schemes of pleasure in which I have been disappointed are a sort of check upon my expressions and make me pro∣mise with  fear  As to Dodsley's performance which you must have received before this time I will make no observations till I have the plea∣sure of seeing you and yet there are many points I would discuss and many accounts I want to give you So many indeed that they would furnish out perhaps a superficial drawling letter but would serve infinitely better for conversation with the book before us The volume I am told is well received in town though political intelligence must engross much of its present attention  Mr Hylton is in my neighbourhood and upon the point of settling at his farm Could you possibly spend a week with us we would try to make it agreeable At all events I beg to hear from you and that not merely as it will afford me great pleasure but as at the same time it will ease me of some solicitude I will not make this a long letter though I wish to receive a long  one in return having a head very little quali∣fied to add any thing that may amuse you though a heart very sincerely and affectionately at your service  W SHENSTONE  LXXXV To the same  The Leasowes  Dec  Dear Mr Jago  THOUGH the silence that has prevailed for so long a time betwixt us be I fear to be placed to  my  account yet do I by no means imagine that you will desire me to fill half this letter with apologies Suffice it that I owe all the world at this time either letters visits or money yet that my  heart  is as well disposed in each of these respects as that of any one per∣son who is insolvent The regard indeed that I owe to you has been a troublesome inmate with∣in my bosom for some time past making daily remonstrances against the injustice which I have done it and urging me strenuously to take horse and make my  personal  apologies at Har∣buryI return you many thanks for Mr S's company and for the sight of the ma∣nuscript which he shewed me Alas that I cannot spare money to drain and to improve my lands or to put almost any part of his excel∣lent rules in execution and yet that Mr Childe of Kinlett hearing my place always termed a farm should come expecting to find all things managed here according to the perfection of  husbandry  As little  can  I pretend to improve Mr S's treatise as his treatise  will  my farm no farther at  most  than in what regards the  stile  or  plan  of his performance Yet could I wish  to see both  it  and  him  again before he prints it wishing him all the success which his very  en∣deavour  deserves Assuredly the present is not the  time  for his publication more  immediate  re∣medies than can be derived from agriculture are become absolutely requisite to relieve the sufferings of this nationI should be extremely wellpleased to visit you at Harbury but cannot even propose to myself that happiness at  present  and were I even to  promise  have but too much reason to know the  uncertainty  of my  performance  Yet am I sensible enough we  ought to meet  if we purpose that what we print should have the ad∣vantage of our mutual criticisms Let me then  conjure  you to come over at your convenience for a few days that we may agree at least upon some  general  points and make no worse a figure in the future Miscellany than we have done in the foregoing  See the Edinburgh Review No  But I have really more things to  say  than I will pretend to  scrawl  upon  paper  nor can I endure to retail a few particulars while I am impatient to communicate the whole  Let me acquaint you while I remember that there is at this time a Mr Duncombe and his son clergymen that are publishing a new trans∣lation of Horace Whatever you may think of their  success  after  Francis  I believe I may pro∣nounce them men of real merit and in no wise destitute of learning or genius They have re∣quested me to communicate any  version  or  imita∣tion  that I can furnish either of my own or of any friends wherefore it you  have  any thing of this fort I should be glad if you would put it in my power to oblige them The son has an  "Ode to Health"  in the fourth volume of Dodsley's Miscellany  Under the head of intelligence I have mighty little to conveyThe house at Hagley is in a manner finished so far as concerns the shell  and wants nothing besides a portico to be as compleat as most in Englandpray remember me to Mr Talbot Mr Miller and Mr Hol∣beach should they call upon me next year they will find my place better worth their no∣tice  I am and  have  been ever cordially and most affectionately  Your most obedient servant W SHENSTONE  LXXXVI To Mr GRAVES with some Account of Politics and Poetry  The Leasowes  April  Dear Mr Graves  YOU will be harrassed with my letters till you condemn my excessive leisure as loud∣l  as I have lamented that you should ever feel the  want  of it Nor is it a point so easily deci∣ded  which  of us may be the greater  sufferer  you through my  officiousness  or I by your long  silence  Yet the partiality which you have ever shewn me will I think dispose you to receive my let∣ters more patiently than it is in my power to sus∣tain the loss of  yours  After all I should not write at present but that the Miscellanies with which Dodsley compliments us arrived last week at the Leasowes I desire therefore you would acquaint me whether the fe  t that he means for you should remain here till your arri∣val or if you chuse that I should send it by the Birminghamstage to Bath Having made this enquiry I was thinking to conclude but cannot reconcile myself to the  novelty  of sending  you  three empty pages The Parliament will  rise too soon for the publication of my  "Rural Elegance"  and having performed my promise to Dodsley I think no more about such  laurels  as the  public  can bestow upon me but am giving all my attention to such as I can purchase of my nurseryman I wish however that the vo∣lume may recompense Dodsley for his trouble I may also add for his ingenuity and for his politeness in giving each of us a compleat sett They are elegantly bound and all as much alike as possible  The present crisis of stateaffairs does not seem to favour his publication as the attention of the public must lean greatly to that quarter I saw a letter from Sir William M who corres∣ponds with Lady Luxborough which placed the struggles of the ministry in a clearer light than they had yet appeared to me It seems that persons of all denominations are for carry∣ing on the war with vigour and the King's ap∣plication for a Vote of Credit was received with general approbation The zeal of the Parlia∣ment was indeed so remarkable on this occasion that instead of the  l  at first intended it was thought proper to propose a million But the services were ascertained and the Chan∣cellor of the Exchequer made accountable for the application of it The augmentation of the fleet with seamen the raising ma∣rines on a plan of dividing them into small com∣panies which will render them more useful both by sea and land the completion and re∣inforcement of the Irish regiments are the uses to which this million is to be appropriated Mr Fox and his landwar party sat mute whilst Mr Legge with great openness and per∣spicuity explained the present schemes as they were calculated to exert our whole strength at sea and if possible no where else Mr Dod∣ington who it seems has not spoke for many years charmed every body His wit did not  only entertain but animate and affect his hear∣ers  "It were better  he said  than lose the domini∣on of the Ocean that the Ocean should overwhelm us for what Briton could wish to leave a posterity crawling upon this island only to feel the tyranny and swell the victories of France"  It seems F in his opposition to the Duke of New∣castle is supported by the Duke of Cumber∣land his army and the Scotch that the minis∣try or the D of N's party seem not displeas∣ed with a prospect of uniting with the Tories who now hold the balance and it seems the Tories by Sir William's letter are as little dis∣pleased to unite with the Ministry  You will guess that good part of this political account is  transcribed  and you will guess aright I had some thoughts that it might amuse you and had no occasion to use other expressionsLet me now once more return to the futile ob∣jects of my  own  amusement The impression upon this letter will be taken from my new seal The motto that I have pitched upon is SUPER∣EST MEMORIA though I yet retain some hank∣ering after the single word PRAETERITIS Pro∣bably this however is not the last seal that I shall cause this man to cut in steel The altar is not yet finished ANTE OMNIA MUSAE but it does not quite satisfy meI will inclose the two last letters I received from Mr Dodsley but you must not think I build too much upon any compli∣ment which he there makes meIt is true I think him a very sincere man but he cannot have been conversant so long with modernwriters but he must conjecture when their piece is published that they a little hunger for applause I am now uncertain whether you will receive a letter from him as he has unaccountably I think sent your books  hither  and not to Bath I am however fully satisfied that your first and last pieces more  especially  do credit to his collection and must please all persons of taste  I desire my best respects to Mrs Graves who will be pleased to see the affection that subsists betwixt you perpetuated She will also feel some satisfacton in the professions of friendship that are made you by your most affectionate and faithful humble servant  W SHENSTONE  LXXXVII To the same with a Recommendation of Mr  Dodsley  to his Acquaintance  From Mr Baskerville's Birmingham  July  Dear Mr Graves  IT were needless for me to recommend to you a person whom you so truly esteem as Mr Dodsley and from whom you will gladly receive a visit not more upon  my  account than upon  his  and your  own  All I beg is that considering the shortness of his time at Bath you will be acquainted with him at first sight which I think should ever be a maxim with persons of genius and humanityHe has made a few days extremely agreeable to me at The Leasowes has been shewing me his new Tragedy which I wished you also might peruse If I be not un∣accountably imposed upon by my friendship for the writer the extraordinary merit of this per∣formance is altogether unquestionableI will not inform you through what hands it has passed in town because I would have you communi∣cate your sentiments to him with entire freedom being assured the delicacy of them may  yet  be of service and that the openness with which you communicate them will be infinitely pleasing to Mr Dodsley He has done me the honour to ask me for an epilogueI  wish  but  fear  to un∣dertake itShould any lucky hint occur to  you  I well know how much you are able to ma∣nage it to advantage In that case I would beg a line from you the first opportunityWhat talk I of a line from you who am at this very time many letters and apologies in your debt but I cannot add many syllables to the letter I am wri∣tingI will write again in a few days Mean time my compliments to Mrs Graves and remember that Mr Dodsley and you become well acquainted at first sight  I am ever dear Mr Graves Your most affectionate humble servant W SHENSTONE  LXXXVIII To the same on Mr  Dodsley  and his Works  The Leasowes  Mar  Dear Mr Graves  I HAVE passed a very dull and unamusive winter herethe worse for being neither  disposed  nor  qualified  to keep up a correspondence with my friends with  you  among the  chief  and yet it is upon you that I must depend to make up my deficiencies with Mr DodsleyThe poor man has been afflicted with the most  lasting  fit of the gout he ever underwent beforeHis patience on these occasions is inimita∣ble His excursion to the  Regions of Terror and Pity  is not the only instance of his ability to compose verses in the midst of pain When he sent me a copy of it he let me know that he had transmitted another to you by the same post I should be glad to receive your remarks upon it ere I communicate my own I have for  some weeks past sound my head so terribly confused that it has been with difficulty I could  think  or  express  myself on the most superficial to∣pic I hope in a little time to be able to exa∣mine it more attentively than I can at present yet in the mean while must acknowledge that I think his subject capable of furnishing extraor∣dinary beauties for an Ode and  such  I think he should  call  it dropping the narrative parts and the connexions as much as possible I can∣not wish him to print it without very  material  al∣terations and what would occasion almost the same trouble as it would require to  newwrite  it I do not mean this as a condemnation of what he has already done so much as a proof of my opinion how much he will he able to improve it  After all  it will scarce affect me half so so much as his Tragedy He is so  honest  a man that the work he has to give the world is much better than the specimen or to borrow an idea from  my situation  the grain that he has to deliver will prove much better than the sample It is with shame I acknowledge I have not yet sent him his epilogue and I feel the greater com∣punction of mind upon this score as it is possible he may impute my neglect to Garrick's refusal of his play This weighs nothing with you or me a thousand motives may affect a manager that have little or nothing to do with the merit of the performance yet he may so far thank Mr Garrick that whatever his refusal takes from the  reputation  of his Tragedy it will through Dodsley's industry add apparently to its value I have not yet been able to satisfy myself with every part of your epilogue and must either omit sending it at present or must send him an imperfect copy If you write to him let me beg you to give the most favourable account you  can  of me  Somebody acquainted me I think it was Mr Talbot that your old friend Ballard had be∣queathed you his coins for a legacy I was truly glad to hear it but have wondered since that you never once informed me of so considerable an acquisition  I remember a poem of yours called upon the present taste in gardening which you will not wonder if my late employments make me wish once more to see Be so kind as to send me a copy of this as well as of any other little pieces that you have in your bureau Some of yours deserve a better place than what is assigned them in the Magazine In particular I remem∣ber that upon Enigmas and Mopsy Be assured I will make no  use  of  any  without your previous consent You know I suppose that Dodsley's other Miscellanies do not appear before next winterI have received from him together with his Ode a few Elegies published by Mr Whitehead They are I think worth your perusal and designed by my worthy friend to excite my emulation Alas that I am so ill able to deserve the encouragements which I re∣ceive from him  My neighbour Baskerville at the close of this month publishes his fine edition of Virgil It will for  type  and  paper  be a perfect curiosity He follows the Cambridge edition  What think you of their management in re∣gard to Mr Byng I cannot help thinking the King should  pardon  him The Courtmartial by acquitting him of cowardice or disaffection have left no  motive  for his  negligence  beside an  error of his judgement  for we  cannot  impute it to  supineness indifference  or  inattention  And then to sentence a man for error is to expect infalli∣bility That twelfth article of war is most un∣doubtedly illexpressedPray do not forget my  best respects to Mrs GravesLet me hear from you soon and believe me ever  Your's W SHENSTONE  LXXXIX On the same  The Leasowes  April  Dear Mr Graves  WHAT remarks I had to make upon our friend Dodsley's Ode I sent him the last post I would gladly have occasioned them to pass by Claverton but having delayed them so long I was impatient to convince him that I had not  wholly  disregarded his request They are indeed pretty copious and yet I have reserved to myself the privilege of recriticising when I see his altered copy I recommended to him the addition which you proposed and some others and if he will but take the pains that I have chalked out for him I doubt not that he will render it an excellent Ode though he may not find it a very  popular  one I have also sent him a copy of our epilogue not much different from what you saw to these I added my little Ode on Lady Luxborough's furnishing her libra∣ry and Perry's Verses upon the Malvernwaters At the close of these last there appears with Perry's approbation a short address to Dr Wall of Worcester a very eminent physician and the patron of this mineral who has pro∣moted a subscription in the county towards  building  near this well for the accommodation of strangers  I purpose also to give Dodsley the little Ode I inclose and would beg the favour of you to  advise me concerning the additional stanzas' fix the readings in the rest and to return me the copy  I come now to analyze your remark on Bal∣lard's legacy which is indeed very ingenious but will scarce bear examination nor do I think that you rather wish to have  found  that set of medals than to have them  given  you by a de∣ceased friend Assuredly if we do not allow pleasure to be  predominant  in this kind of melan∣choly we destroy the foundation of all tragic or elegiac writings Melpomene has no place amongst the Muses and the pains that we have taken with our friend Dodsley's pensive Ode have been employed to no purpose But you want not these pedantic flourishes and are wholly of my mind  Martin's Magazine is I believe pretty ob∣scure and I wonder where you got a sight of it It was however fortunate enough for  me  that you gave no copy of  "James Dawson"  I ne∣ver yet saw your verses  on that Grotto  or from  Phaedrus  and I want to see your W once more concerning which you are silent Your  "Pep∣perbox"  and  "Mopsy"  might I think ap∣pear in Dodsley's Miscellany either  with  or  without  your name I also want a copy of your verses upon Riddles and whenever you have a leisure hour should be glad if you would look them out and send them  Go and think yourself an happy man at least if your children be recovered as I am in∣clined to think they are and give my service to Mrs Graves for the happiness that she occasions you of which I cannot but partake being with constant and sincere affection your most obliged humble servant  W SHENSTONE  XC On the same  About  Dear Mr Graves  DO you know my handwritingIt is real∣ly such a length of time since you had de∣mands upon me for letters that I am hardly able to enumerate the several causes of my neg∣lect  This  I know that scarce a day has passed during this interval of silence in which I have not  remembered  you with the most affectionate esteemI  hope  you correspond with our friend Dodsley and that it is not altogether disagreea∣able to you to find he is printing some of your verses He has many alas  too  many of mine which I suffered him to take away in summer and which the state of my winter health and spi∣rits renders me but ill able to revise I believe I am even now the principal cause that his two volumes remain yet unpublished nor can I ex∣press the pain it gives me to be thus detrimental to his interests and to delay the publication of so much better pieces than my own I am also dissatisfied upon  another score  I mean that I have been wanting to myself in not asking the benefit of your advice which I have heretofore experienced to be at once so  comfortable  and so  ad∣vantageous  but although the scheme was project∣ed in summer the business of correction was by  me  at least deferred till winter and then I had neither spirits to  correct  or to  correspond  I am really as much obliged to you for the pains which you took on my behalf in London as though the  subject  of your enquiry were a thing of more  importance  to me but indeed you can hardly conceive how indifferent I am now grown not only as to articles of  that sort  but to aught that regards external splendour  I really have not time to enter upon the me∣rits of inoculation but am very sure that Mrs G's danger was enough to influence  your  de∣termination I am heartily glad to hear of her recovery and can but look upon the weeks which I purpose to pass some time hereafter with you at Claverton as the most agreeable of any that belong to the remainder of my life I I am sensible that if I  coveted  to  shine  in poetry I should lose no time in visiting public places but my wishes of that sort are most extremely li∣mited and I shall visit  you  on the account of  friendship  that is past all doubt on a much  better principle  I have  long  meant to write to you and have accordingly given  some  answer to most parts of your last letter Nevertheless the occasion of this present letter is quite of another kindA young painter of my acquaintance is advised to to go to Bath has a recommendation to the Bishop of B who will introduce him to the Duke of N And though I cannot so easily bring him acquainted with nobles or primemi∣nisters I can give him directions to my friend who in point of taste is their superior The person then who I suppose will be the bearer of this letter has by dint of mere ingenu∣ity risen to a considerable eminence in fruitpieces c He has been employed by Lord Lyttelton and is much admired at Oxford for my own part I believe you will think he is in few respects inferior to and has if I am not mistaken some advantages of Stranover but you will see his pieces All I have to say fur∣ther on the occasion is that he is a native of our parish and a particular friend of  mine  and if it were in your power to promote his interest at Bath you would not only highly gratify me but at the same time do a service to one of the least assuming most ingenious and most amia∣ble  men I knowI beg my best respects to your family and am dear Mr Graves most affec∣tionately  Yours W SHENSTONE  XCI On the same  The Leasowes  May  Dear Mr Graves  I THANK God I have recovered a tolera∣ble degree of health this spring though by no means free from so much heaviness and lassitude as renders me averse to all activity of body and mind In the course of my disorder so long as I could bear to think of  any  sublunary enjoyment I remembered my friends and of course thought much of  you  but its advances were so precipi∣tate when I sent for the physicians that I soon received a  wrench  from every object of this world and it was by slow degrees even after my recovery that my mind took so much root again as appears necessary for its immediate sup∣port I suppose you have been informed that my fever was in great measure hypochondriacal and left my nerves so extremely sensible that even on no very interesting subject I could readily think myself into a vertigo I had almost said an epilepsy for surely I was oftentimes near itIt became therefore expedient for my recovery to amuse myself with a succession of the most trivial objects I could find and this kind of carelessness I have indulged till it is grown into an habit Even letters to my friends are hardly consistent with my rule of health  yet I could be no longer silent with regard to  you  without feeling a sensation that would hurt me  more  This may fairly enough be termed the first  letter  I have wrote since my recovery wherein if I should tell you one half that I am inclined to do relating to this dreadful illness what room should I then leave to speak on any other subject I must therefore tell these things by word of mouth or write them some other time The journies which my friends and in∣deed physicians propose for me are what cer∣tainly bid fairest for the completion of my cure yet there are many many things which how∣ever unfit for the task I must endeavour to ad∣just before I can leave home with any possibili∣ty of enjoyment Need I mention any other than my cursed embarrassment with D who during my  danger  was induced to stop proceed∣ings but is now beginning law afresh and by the removal of tenants from  his  share of the Harborough estate has now wriggled himself into possession of almost one half of  mine  However I am not without hopes of seeing all terminated in a little time nor entirely without a prospect of seeing you at Claverton this sum∣mer That you may think this the more pro∣bable I am pressed by two young gentlemen whom I very much esteem to accompany them on a visit to Mr Bamfylde in Somersetshire These two gentlemen are Mr Dean and Mr Knight Perhaps you may have heard of Mr Bamfylde who is very much at Bath is there now with his lady or has left the place but lately and whose fortune person figure and accomplishments can hardly leave him long un∣noticed in any place where he resides Yet my visit to Estercomb must be of secondary conse∣quence to me whilst you live by the roadside I am much obliged to you for your compliment on my Poematia in Dodsley's Miscellanies  which came very seasonably considering how I had been mortified by the first sight of what was done To speak the truth there are many things appear there very contrary to my intenti∣ons but which I am more desirous may be at∣tributed to the unseasonableness of my fever than to my friend D's precipitation My purpose was to acknowledge as  mine  none of the pieces which now follow the longer Ode to La∣dy Luxborough Her name was actually erased as also my own at the close of your Fable The verses by Mrs Bennet to Mr Richardson were absolutely new to me were my name occurs again All this is against me as a thing in itself invidious to have one's name recur so often and as my  own lines contradict  the merit which my friends so liberally allow meThe verses of mine in the sixth volume which was printed be∣fore the fifth were printed without my know∣ledge and when I sent up an improved copy it arrived a good deal too late As things hap∣pen I am made to own several things of inferior merit to those which I  do not  ownAll this is against me but my thoughts are avocated from this edition and wholly fixed upon a future wherein I hope Dodsley will be prevailed upon to omit some things also from  other  hands which discredit his collection and to balance  all my discomforts  on this head the world will know that I am esteemed by a person whom I esteem so much as youI know not how it happens but the taste for humorous poetry does not prevail at this time yet I cannot agree with Mr J Warton that it is no poetry  at all  any more than that a good representation of Dutch boors is not a pictureHis brother the Pro∣fessor is to be here with his pupil Lord Done∣gal c this summerMr Spence and Mr Dodsley will stay a day or two here this month in their way to Scotland and Mr Home the  author of Douglas c called on me and we spent an evening together at Admiral Smith's Thus my  ferme ornée  procures me interviews with persons whom it might otherwise be my  wish  rather than my good fortune to see Would to God it could attract  you  whom I more long to see than any one and let me tell you there were considerable additions made to it last year Dodsley's present of Faunus a new Gothicbuilding or rather a skreen which cost ten pounds and the ruins of a Priory which however make a tenant's house that pays me tolerable poundageI am growing a little into  your  taste why should not you ad∣vance farther into  mine  I mean I have a love for medals by means of some that have been given me yet do not think that I shall ever ri∣val  you  My object is only  beauty  and I love only those of exquisite workmanship so that this is no more a rivalship than that of two per∣sons who admire the sex but love different individuals a rivalship which I trust is more likely to cement our friendship than disunite us which it is my  conviction  and my  comfort  no  sort  of rivalship will ever do I have hardly room to express my good wishes for long health and happiness to Mrs Graves and your little family and to subscribe myself my dear friend  Your ever affectionate humble servant W SHENSTONE  XCII On the same  July  Dear Mr Graves  IT gives me great anxiety when I reflect how long I have waited for the satisfaction of a line from you I beg if you are alive and well you will let me know so by the next post  Mr Dodsley and Mr Spence have been here and stayed a week with me The former was in certain hopes of seeing you in town but I do not find that he either saw or heard from you which  adds  to my anxiety  I have seen few whom I liked so much upon so little acquaintance as Mr Spence extreme∣ly polite friendly chearful and master of an infinite fund of subjects for agreeable conversa∣tion Had my affairs permitted me they had certainly drawn me with them into Scotland whither they are gone for about a month upon a journey of curiosity  I believe it will give you pleasure to hear that my lawsuit with D is accommodated by the generous interposition of my Lord Stamford concerning whose benevolence and magnanimity it is impossible for me to speak in the terms which they deserve It is ended I hope not very  disadvantageously  for me apparently with  one  advantage of being intirely exculpated in the opinion of all mankind The common me∣thod as M Bruyere observes is to condemn  both  on these occasionsThis suits people's in∣dolence and favours their impartialityAnd though the equitableness of my whole conduct in this affair was selfevident to all that were near me yet I found many that were inclined to blame us  both  and  some  that I could never convince till  now  that the fault was not  wholly  mine  Your  "Pepperbox and Saltseller"  are in one of the ChroniclesThey pillage Dodsley's two last volumes of all that is worth perusalI surely have some friend amongst the writers of the Monthly Review for I have not only escaped a flogging but am treated with great civility  I never know how to leave off when I begin writing to you having always a great deal to say I only purposed you a few lines to desire you would write directly Pray make my best compliments to Mrs Graves and believe me ever yours most invariably  W SHENSTONE  XCIII To the same containing an Account of his Excursions and Amusements  The Leasowes  Nov  Dear Mr Graves  I HAVE had daily expectations of a line from you these two months conscious how∣ever that I did not deserve any and affording a manifest instance of of the infatuations of selflove The last letter that I received of yours is dated the close of July since which time I have been chiefly engaged in my customary amuse∣ments embellishing my farm and receiving the company that came to see it My principal  ex∣cursions  have been to Enville on Lord Grey's birthday to Lord Ward's upon another invi∣tation and to the Worcester Musicmeeting I need not mention what an appearance there was of company at Worcester dazzling enough you may suppose to a person who like me has not seen a public place these ten years Yet I made a shift to enjoy the splendour as well as  the music that was prepared for us I presume nothing in the way of harmony can passibly go further than the Oratoria of The Messiah It seems the best composer's best composition Yet I fancied I could observe  some parts  in it where∣in Handel's judgment failed him where the music was not equal or was even  opposite  to what the words required Very many of the noblesse whom I had seen at The Leasowes were as complaisant to me as possible whereas it was my  former  fate in public places to be as little regarded as a journeyman shoemakerThere I first saw our present Bishop also our late Bishop's monument which is fineLastly there I first saw my Lady Coventry to whom I believe one must allow all that the world al∣lows in point of beautyShe is certainly the most  unexceptionable  figure of a woman I ever saw and made most of the ladies there seem of almost another  species  On the whole I was not a little pleased that I had made this excur∣sion and returned with double relish to the  en∣joyment  of my  farm  It is now high time to take some notice of your obliging letterI think I was not told the purport of the journey you made to London so can only say I am very sorry for the aggravating circumstances of your disap∣pointment and hope long before this time that Mrs Graves is quite recoveredDid I for∣get to make your excuses to Dodsley or nohe was here as I remember soon after with Mr Spence in their way to ScotlandMr Spence the man  you  would like and who would like  you  of all mankind He took my Elegies into Scot∣land and sent them back on his return with a sheet or two of criticisms and an handsome let∣terHow much am I interested in the preser∣vation of his friendshipand yet such is my  destiny  for I can give it no other name I have never wrote to him  since  This  impartiality  of  my neglect you must accept  yourself  as  some  apo∣logy but to proceed Mr Spence chose him∣self an oak here for a seat which I have inscri∣bed to him  SPENCE'S OAK  EXIMIO NOSTRO CRITONI  CVI DICARI  Subintellige SEDEM ISTAM hanc  VELLET  MVSARVM OMNIVM ET CRATIAVM CHORVS  DICAT AMICITIA  I absolutely  forgot  to talk to Dodsley about your and I am vexed because I could with a safe conscience have raised his idea of your abilitiesHowever it is not too late even if you care to publish it this winterHis play comes on I fancy  this very night  at Co∣ventgarden What he says in behalf of this step is that there was no glimpse of probability that Garrick would ever admit it at the other house  He says the players liked it and seemed inclined to take  Mrs Bellamy is his Cleone and speaks the epilogue of which more anon I suppose he acts by Lord Chesterfield's opinion for I know when he was going to print it since he came home with a  proper  dedication to Mr Garrick my Lord then prevented him telling him it  would  be acted one day or otherDid I ever send you a copy of the epilogue with all the additions and alterations Dods∣ley first liked then disliked it and lastly liked it again only desiring me to soften the satire shorten the whole for it was upwards of sixty lines and add a complimentary close to the  boxes  All this I have endeavoured and sent it him last Monday  You  would not care to own it and he would fain have  me  but I think  neither of us should run the risque where so little honour is to be acquired yet Mr Mel∣moth's name to the prologue is an inducementI was very near surprizing you at Claverton this autumn with my friend young Knight in his way to Mr Bamfylde's but he goes  again  in spring and I shall certainly accompany him I have  bespoke  but not yet  procured  any horses for my chaise It is a neat one you will find and I have made two or three excursions in itI saw Mr Patchen's Topographical Letters soon after they were publishedIt you continue to me the honour of a shield in your Gothic al∣cove the field should be either  "Or three Kingfishers proper"  or with the addition of a chief gules three trefoils argentno bar cheve∣ron bend cMore of this when I write againMotto FLVMNINA AMEM SYLVASQUE IN∣GLORIVSRVRA MIHI  I cannot recollect my company of the season to tell it youSir Francis Dashwood Lord Litchfield and Mr Sheldon were here together in the beginning of the autumn and I have strong invitations to visit themI have a very genteel letter from Sir Francis offering me gold∣fishes and I have a double inducement to visit Mr Sheldon as he lives near Mickleton and is the most agreeable man aliveYour acquaint∣ance Lord W dined and spent good part of a day with meUnder a sort of gloomy appear∣ance a man of admirable sense and some hu∣mourI put him in mind of you and the re∣markable monument at CambdenMr Thomas Warton was also here with Lord Donegal and has since sent me his  "Inscriptions"  which are rather too simple even for my tasteBishop of Worcester with his family and companyLord WilloughbyLord FoleyI mention Lord Fo∣ley the rather because I shall call on your friend Dr Charleton who was also here to pass a  day or two with me at WhitleyI shall pass also a day or two at our Bishop's whom I met since at Enville These two  propose  what I  will  besides will probably be the principal or only excur∣sions that I shall make this winterGod send it may no more affect my health than it has hither∣to doneI am at present tolerably well and live more temperately than beforeWould to God you could come over go with me to Dr Charleton's and Lord Foley's and Lord Stam∣ford's and pass a week here I would meet you with my chaise at Worcester or even farther I have finished a building opposite to the new sta∣ble which I think you sawThey together give my house a degree of splendour Did you see my priorya tenant's house one room whereof is to have Gothic shields round the corniceI am in some doubt whether to make it an House of Lords or House of Commons if the former my private friends will have shields round my Gothic bedchrmberThe wretch is cursed that  begins  a letter with no better a pen than I  finish  one with My dear friend write directly a long letterKeep me alive in the memory of Mr Graves and believe me ever yours most affecti∣onately  W SHENSTONE  XCIV To the same in Expectation of a Visit  Christmas  Dear Mr Graves  THERE  can  be nothing more welcome to me than the intelligence which you give of your intended visit at The Leasowes God knows how few of these interviews may for the future be allotted to us and I should be glad at least  to testify the joy which they afford me by meet∣ing you at Birmingham or elsewhere within one day's journey for my chaisePray be so good as to give me one more letter before you set outVery glad should I be to pay my respects to your brother at Mickleton for whom I have the truest respect but dare not give encouragement for fear that aught should interfereI have ten thousand things to say to you but will defer them I think  all  I am positive your may be made  advantageous  to you by means of Dodsley and even  reputable  if you so pleaseWill not Mrs G accompany you pray con∣vince her of my sincere regard  I want to congratulate you on your escape from the smallpox in a manner  different  from your ordinary acquaintance yet am not able to ex∣press my sentimentsguess the rest knowing and sufficiently knowing that I am with constan∣cy and ardour your most affectionate friend  W SHENSTONE  XCV To Mr JAGO  The Leasowes  Jan  Dear Mr Jago  IF you knew the maxims on which I conduct myself you might call me perhaps  unpolite  but I think by no means  unfriendly  I mean with respect to the  ordinary congratulations  on your  marriage  Were you and I less intimate less ex∣perienced and less assured friends it had been no venial omission to have neglected such a ce∣remony Perhaps I should not have neglected it but as I have the satisfaction of believing that you would rejoice in any success of mine  so I hope you would not distrust my sentiments upon any change of your condition which you yourself esteemed for the  better  I do indeed my worthy friend wish you much joy both  now  and at  all  times and you will ever discern it in my face as often as fortune grants us an inter∣viewMr S is a benevolent man and I am sure would withhold no information that tended to  illustrate  our friendship on either side  I have thoughts of proceeding on to Harbury whenever I come to Mr Wren's as I have long enough made my friend a promise and intend ere long to do Many reasons occur why I cannot set forward tomorrow morning are these rea∣sons substantial or no other than the sly and sophistical insinuations of indolencesurely the former  Dodsley and indeed Mr Spence both expect me in town this FebruaryI fear it will not  be  but if it  should  how readily would I give notice and become obliged to you for your company  Though I should have  expected  you would select a partner whose society you could enjoy yet I was not a little satisfied with the hint given me in your letter as well as in one I had before re∣ceived from Mr S It is not for such ladies as you and I esteem that Mrs  See Epilogue to Cleone  Bellamy's ex∣traordinary lecture was intended and a  lecture  it would have been with a vengeance had not D omitted some thirty lines and substituted about twelve or fourteen of his own However he is now going to print his fourth edition of it in which the original epilogue will be restored as well as considerable improvements introduc∣ed into his play He sold two thousand of his first edition the very first day he published it  I have so  much  to tell you and of so  various  kinds that I am afraid to expatiate upon  any  one article Cannot you make a shift to call upon  me before  my public life  arrivesI would send my chaise to meet you at any place you should appoint  I have passed my winter hitherto pretty chear∣fully amongst my books in what I  call  my libra∣ry It now better deserves that name by the form I have given it and the volumes I have ad∣dedMr S would tell you something of my  other  occupations  I could wish that you would favour me with a copy of your Essay on Electricity and with any new copy of verses of your own or of your friendsBe not apprehensive there shall no∣thing more appear in print of your composition without your explicit consentAnd yet I have thoughts of amusing myself with the publication of a small Miscellany from neighbour Basker∣ville's press if I can save myself harmless as to expenceI purpose it no larger than a  "Lans∣down's" a "Philips's" or a "Pomfret's Poems"  Have you read my friend Dr Grainger's Tibul∣lusIt affords you an elegant edition of a good translation and of the text He is engaged in a war with S and has just sent me his pamphlet which I could wish you to read in order to form a judgement of S's character Spence I see has advertised his  "Parallel be∣twixt Malliabecqui and his Taylor"  It is mere∣ly a charitable design and such are now all Spence's views  What remains of my paper must be employed not in  mere  ceremony although in something that bears the form of it in my best compliments to Mrs Jago and my offer not indeed of a part of the friendship which I owe you but rather of an equal quantity in an assurance of the cordiality with which I shall rejoice to see both her and you and in confirmation of that affection with  which I have ever been and am my good friend your mos obedient servant  W SHENSTONE  XCVI To Mr GRAVES on their several Situations and Compositions  The Leasowes  April  Dear Mr Graves  YOU will think my silence long and I should be sorry to  have  you quite regard∣less of it although I fear it must be my fate to trespass frequently upon your kind solicitudeI have no excuse to make besides some frivolous avocations and  much  of that heaviness and lassi∣tude which disinclines one to write lettersI passed the former part of winter with more vi∣vacity than I did the latter or even the incipient spring owing possibly to these cold winds which will not permit me to use my wonted exercise You will laugh at the word  vivacity  when applied to so dull an animal but I speak comparatively of that unmeaning drowsiness which is my lot at other times and  was  in some sort while you were here  Mr Dodsley tells me he received a letter from you acquainting him that Cleone would be played at Bath I should be glad to receive from you any particulars of its success He is publish∣ing an elegant edition of it which I expect by this very post The new plate of my grove which will appear at the end of his Melpomene is perhaps liable to some exceptions but by much the best that has yet appeared Do not forget to send me your objections to it As to  the epilogue I have totally banished I think every one of the lines which he  substituted  have left to him the choice of two or three readings for the four last lines and though none of them quite please me yet the epilogue on the whole discovers more of genius is more spirited and less inaccurate I shall be glad to find that you think the same with me  In regard to your place so far as I can form an idea of it I would have you consult  self  amuse∣ment I mean without too much regard to what  others  say or think As to distinguishing your ingenuity which I unfeignedly desire you may the press affords you more  adequate  materials than either your fortune or perhaps your place Do not imagine however that I shall not be much delighted with every stroke I trace of yours at Claverton My faculties are very strongly in∣tuitive in respect of every thing belonging to you and I should be ashamed if any nook or angle that you had rounded any wall that you had ruina∣ted any stream that you had diverted or any single shrub that you had planted should elude my discovery yet you will shine  more  by means of the press and if I said any thing concerning your that did not  encourage  you to perfect it I am sure I must use terms very inexpressive of my meaning Without any more words let me  intreat  you to proceed with it give a  full scope  to your imagination and if there should be aught one would wish  retrenched  it is mighty  easily done  I have indeed  thoughts  for I  never  use the word  resolutions  of publishing my Elegies next winteryou will gainsay when I tell you my intention of publishing also my very farm at least about eight or ten scenes taken from it by way of top∣and tailpieces for those elegiesThe world will perhaps tax my vanity but I do not in the least  careThe pleasure which that world gives me I am very conscious will not be too  high  and I am determined that the pain it may seek to give shall bear proportion yet should I be sorry to obtrude stuff upon it either from the pencil or the pen and my good friend Mr Dodsley has sometimes pained me not a little  I tell you you  cannot  allow for winterThat very scene near Priorygate shews not a bit of road in  summer  though the consciousness of a firm rail there would add to my own tranquilli∣tyMr Knight has given me Strange's prints which I hear are fine Dodsley gives me swans but for these two months past I have been a librarian or rather a bookbinder yet nothing more  unfeignedly  than yours and Mrs Graves's most affectionate humble servant  W SHENSTONE  XCVII To the same on Fables Mottoes Urns Inscriptions c  The Leasowes  Oct  Dear Mr Graves  DEPEND upon it I shall see Claverton before winterThe mischief is that with as violent a propensity as ever person felt I shall not be able to reach your hemisphere while Mr Spence Mr Dodsley and Mr Whitehead give it such peculiar lustre in my eyes This I did not despair of doing at the time Mr Dodsley left me at Birmingham It turned upon an event which I did not indeed explain to him the accommodation of the affair with D which concerns near one half of my little fortune and which if I have any luck on my side must  now be perfected within a fortnight I was shewn the rough sketch of our  conveyances  last SaturdayOnce for all my  indolence  is not in fault my health and my worldly embarrassments  have  often been so and at present  are  "Pol me miserum patrone vocares si verum c"  Dodsley to give his book eclat should allow himself time to  abridge  and  polish  It is not enough in my opinion merely to surpass L'Es∣trange and Croxall The grand  exception  to Fables consists in giving  speech  to animals c a greater  violation  of  truth  than appears in any other kind of writing This objection is insur∣mountable Their peculiar  advantage  is to re∣move the offensiveness of advice in order to which one should perhaps pursue a medium betwixt the superfluous garniture of La Fontaine c and the naked simplicity and laconism of Phaedrus In respect of his own newinvented Fables I wish him to devise uncommon subjects and to inculcate refined morals But pray send me  your  two directly which will answer all that I expect in Fables  Did Mr Dodsley tell you of the seat in my shrubbery which I had taken the freedom to in∣scribe to you I could not  satisfy  myself in an inscription and from a kind of spleen and aversion to delay made use of the shortest that I could devise The seat and scroll are elegant The inscription only  AMICITIAE ET MERITIS  RICHARDI GRAVES  IPSAE TE TITYRE PINVS IPSI TE FONTES c VOCABVNT  I will not be so affected as to pretend that the much greater compliment you design  me  is more offensive to my modesty than it is pleasing to my  friendship I wish however it could be a little shortened The  "inter hortensis elegantiae stu∣diosos"  seems a little too verbose for inscription Beside I had  rather  the compliment were not thrown with so much  emphasis  upon any skill I have in gardening but in some sort  divided  be∣twixt  that  and  poetry  if you perceive no great objection suppose  AMICITIAE G S  QVI  NAIADAS PARITER AC MVSAS  EXCOLENDO  SIMVL ET VILLAM EIVS ELEGANTISSIMAM

NVDRISSI PIV QVE DI SPEME"  How do you like this motto for an urn  My best compliments to Mr Spence and Mr Dodsley if at Bath I will write soon to each of themyour garden is as pretty as you can make it  XCVIII To the same  The Leasowes  Oct  Dear Mr Graves  I WANT no conviction of the pleasure which you will receive from the termination of my infernal lawsuit It must if I have  any  luck be finally adjusted in about nine days time after having robbed me of my peace for  six of the best years of my life During the  for∣mer  part of life I languished for an acquaintance somewhat more extensive and when the com∣pany that flocked to see my place removed all grounds of  that  complaint this accursed dispute arose and mixed with every enjoyment that was offered meI have sometimes found entertain∣ment in balancing the good and evil that has been allotted me in general and have in the end imagined the good prevalent and that I have great reason to be thankful for more happiness than I deserveYet are there many awkward circumstances that forbid the  scale  to fall  precipi∣tately  among the chief I place the distance to which I see you and one or two others removed This is indeed an heavy article and were it not for letters would be insupportable  As to Mr Dodsley's collection of Fables you are mistaken if you think that I perused the quar∣to book I dipped into it here and there and thought there wanted  much  alteration There was a little book with a papercover on which I bestowed no small pains and when I had so done crossed the Fables which I thought might well enough pass muster Addison would have been the best writer of Fables of any author I knowthe purity of stylethe concisenessthe dry humourand the familiar mannerAs to Dodsley's publishing this winter he may possibly do so without loss of credit but when one con∣siders that they are or ought to be the standard for years to come one can hardly avoid wishing him to give them the polish of another summer 'Twas fortunate that you pitched upon  "The Raven and Magpie"  to transcribe for me as Mr Dodsley had sent me  "The Sunflower and the Tuberose"  before  I think the last somewhat inferior but will reconsider it before I write again The Fable which I literally translated  from Phaedrus was  "The Wolf and the Crane"  in order to give Dodsley an idea on  what  Rollin laid the stress in Fables  As to the inscription I will endeavour to ad∣just it to your mind  "Meritisque reconditiori∣bus"  may do but is not explicit enough I want fully to express a character that shines remarka∣bly among select acquaintance and yet through extreme refinement makes less figure in the pub∣lic eye  I had made the same objection to Burke's chapter upon  words  and yet there seems to be something right in it Du Bos which I have only seen in  French  but which I believe is also translated consists of three volumes mo His subjects are pleasing and his knowledge may be entertaining but his genius seems not very pro∣found from the little that I have consulted in him  Dodsley is  precisely  what you say of him an object of esteem and love and in some  degree  of admiration His  ear  does not wholly please me in writing and yet he is intimately affected with musickLord L's ear is perhaps the reverse I mean he does not much regard music yet writes harmoniously in verse and prose  Robertson I think to buyButler also though I shall not admire himLord Clarendon when I am  rich  Rasselas has a few refined sentiments thinly scattered but is upon the whole below Mr J Did I tell you I had a letter from Johnson inclosing Vernon's Parishclerk Pray take Dodsley's advice in regard to your and heighten the ridiculousness of your  heroe  which  his  kind of  lunacy  will countenance yet admit him to say good thingsBut do not make any alteration in the narrative of your own sto∣ryat least till I have again perused itDo not spurn this fifty pounds It will procure you  numerous conveniences which you would per∣haps otherwise deny yourself  I have passed four or five days betwixt this week and last at my Lord Ward's at HinleyThis has furnished me with franks beside the consolation I derive from  having paid  a visit of  this kind  It is  "spinis è pluribus  una  saltem ex∣empta"  The  restraint  renders them  spinae  I hope I may say so without umbrage or giving an appearance of disrespect For Mr W is an agreeable man and my reception was very polite  I have three or four more of these superb vi∣sits to make and which I may not omit without giving real offence To Lord Plymouth next week Lord Stamford's the week after then to Lord Lyttelton at our Admiral's and then to Lord Foley if your friend Dr Charleton will accompany me then c alas alas  "Quid me exempta juvat spina"  I must conclude upon a separate paper That your  expectation  may not  deceive  you in regard to the plan I promised I inclose a survey of my farm reduced to minia∣ture by a neighbouring artist Let me know if it bring the place to your memoryI think to have a plate which may be done at Birmingham for six or eight shillings that shall leave me no trouble but to tinge the impressions with colours in order to give my friends But do you advise me to engrave  this  or another that is twice as large  I have purchased  "Gerard upon Taste"  the author of which is a Professor at Edinburgh and the book commended in the Reviewyou will say that the Reviewers are partial to Scotchpeo∣pleI know nothing of that but the book is learned and on a pleasing subjectI may per∣haps add a ver  important  onefor surely it is altogether unquestionable that taste  naturally  leads  to virtue I am however in some doubt whe∣ther it will give you that amusement which Burke's has doneI  must  now take my leave having engagements of a different kind but not till I have desired my hearty respects to Mrs Graves and her acceptance of this  "Grove and Kingfisher"  I am dear Mr Graves ever and most entirely your very affectionate  W SHENSTONE  XCIX To the same on his Want of Leisure  The Leasowes  Nov  Dear Mr Graves  THOUGH I write to you again so soon yet it really grieves me to hear the com∣plaint which you so often make for want of time I who have time to  waste  by lustres cannot have patience with the world that suffers  you  to want the leisure which you would employ to so much better purposes Perhaps however you are as  happy  as more leisure could  make  you the case is not so  clear  as to leave me satisfied of the con∣trary And yet as the pleasures of imagination have an undoubted claim to a real existence they must surely afford very  lively  sensations to persons of your sensibility and refinementBe this as it may I  will  always  murmur  that you can so ill spare time for literary amusementNever∣theless make  one  effort and finish the task you have now before you I must confess you may naturally reply that I am now become an inte∣rested person but  this  I am sure will be no check to your activity  Mr William Duncombe sent with the first volume of Horace one of the satires in Ms  inscribed to me  Upon purchasing however the second volume I find  my  name is changed to HawkesworthWho knows but I lost this com∣pliment by writing to you my friend while I should have been writing to himif so indeed you ought to make it up to me and I am sure I shall prize  your  compliment beyond that of which I have been deprived  The view of B which you mention I have indeed seen a long time ago but surely the  wa∣terfall  is quite detestable There is something on each side as I remember that puts one in mind of a porridgepot boiling over beneath the potlid The appearance of the house and the background is better this was adjusted by the painter the other as I think Smith told me by an old housesteward of Lord T's  I have inclosed another copy of the lines to Venus for your emendationThank you for the stanza you introducedI meant indeed  before  to allude to  natural  beauty more than  mo∣ral  but did not fully enough express myself There remains no transition now but from  animal  beauty to  inanimate  which is easier  You will observe that I take great liberties with the Fables you ask me to reviseDodsley must think me  very  fantastical or  worse  while I was correcting those he wrote at The LeasowesI find my  ear  much more apt to take offence than most other people's and as  his  is far less delicate than mine he must of course believe in many places that I altered merely for alte∣ration's sake I cannot be easy without some certain proportion betwixt one sentence and ano∣ther betwixt one member of a sentence and ano∣ther without a melody at the close of a paragraph almost as agreeable as your  "magnificent salon"  I have not written to Dodsley any decent let∣ter since he arrived at his house in London  I must now apply myself to write half a score Fables and if he chuses it a translation of La Motte's Discourse upon the subjectYour reply in regard to the delay of  my  publication cannot be answered that is certain  Whitefield's Journal I  fear  is purged of its  most  ridiculous passagesDodsley brought one down hither for Mr Deane to shew my Lord Dth but he tells me there remains nothing of that  gross  absurdity which I saw in your bro∣ther's at Mickleton  The painter whom I just mentioned to have taken some portraits through my recommendati∣on and to have painted a ruin for my green∣room offers to give me my picture if I chuse to sitWere you here to lend me your assistance I should certainly complyMean while tell me what you think of some of the attitudes that I inclose What I myself prefer at present is to  lessen  my  dimensions  which of itself gives a kind of beauty and to appear in a kind of nightgown agreeable to the attitude marked AA The man evidently hits off likenesses and is esteemed to  shine  among the painters of Birmingham I shall be forced to have you picture copied by him which by means of dampness flies off the canvas so that on the whole I shall re pay his complimentThis last article puts me in mind that I owe you my picture whenever you de∣mand it but I would chuse to defer it till the spring for some certain reasons regarding oecono∣my Remember me  always  to good Mrs and believe me yours with all possible affection  W SHENSTONE  C To the same with an Account of a Design for his own Picture  The Leasowes  Jan  Dear Mr Graves  WERE I to regulate my compliments by the arrival of  times  and seasons I should congratulate you upon a  correspondence  which now enters upon its three and twentieth yearOur  frienship  is of something older date and is not this an  atchievement  that deserves the honour of a  triumph  both for you and me tooMore I am sure than the regular destruction of fifteen or twenty thousand wretches in the field consider∣ing how  uncommon  we find friendships of so long a duration and how  cheap  we find such victories not only on the Prussian but on the Austrian side  Mr Cambridge Scriblerus who called here this autumn was considering this massacre rather in a philosophical than political view and in∣deed it does not appear to me that plague earthquake or famine are more pernicious to the human race than what the world calls Heroes but enough of this  Your want of leisure gives me pain surely if I may guess by one or two of your last letters you have enlarged the number of your scholars and extended your domestic cares beyond what your circumstances  require  You must not judge of my painter's abilities by the small sketch I incloseI desired him to give me a  slight  one and have perhaps ruined even  that  by endeavouring to bring it nearer to what the picture now  is myself  It will give you a tolerable idea in the most points except the Pan which has his face turned towards the  front and is not near so considerableI chose to have this  term  introduced not only as he car∣ries my favourite reeds but as he is the princi∣pal  sylvan  deityThe Waternymph below has the word  "Stour"  on the mouth of her urn which in some sort rises at The Leasowes On the scroll is  "Flumina amem sylvasque inglorius"  alluding to them  both  The Pan you will per∣haps observe hurts the  simplicity  of the picturenot much as we have managed him and the intention here is I think a balance  The dog on the other side is my faithful Lucy which you perhaps remember and who  must  be  nearer  the  body  than she perhaps would if we had more room However I believe I shall cause her head to cut off that little cluster of angles where the balustrade joins the base of the arch The balustrade is an improvement we made the other day it is I think a great one not only as it gives a symmetry or balance to the curtain of which you complained but as it ex∣tends the  area  on which I stand and shortens the  length  of this  halfarch  The painter objected to a tree I know not why unless that we could introduce no  stem  without encroaching too much upon the landscape but the reason be gave was it would be an injury to the faceThe con∣sole is an Apollo's head The impost does not go further than the pilaster which ends the cor∣ner and here the drawing is erroneousWe are I think to have a carpet though we know not well how to manage it  And now I must tell you the dimensionsThe figure itself is three feet three inches and a half the whole picture four feet eleven inches by two feet three inches and threequartersThe colour of the gown a seagreen waistcoat and breeches buffcolour stockings white or rather pearlcolour curtain a terrasienna or  very rich reddish brownI think the whole will have a good effect but beseech you to send me your opinion  directly  There are some things we can alter but there are others we must not  Your shall have one of the size you desire in the spring but will you not calculate for some one place in your room The painter takes very strong likenesses is young rather daring than delicate in his manner though he paints well in enamel goodnatured slovenly would im∣prove much by application Adieu  W S  CI To the same on Fable and other Articles of Taste and Literature  The Leasowes  Feb  Dear Mr Graves  I COULD not understand by Mr Dodsley's last letter to me that he had any  sort  of in∣tention to publish his Fables this winter Pre∣suming upon this delay and having neither had the  leisure  nor the  frame  of mind fit to take his preface into consideration I have hitherto de∣ferred to do so and can only say in  general  that I could wish you had happened to be more co∣pious in your observations La Motte's Discourse on Fables is a most excellent performance con∣taining as appears to  me  all that need be said upon the subject and this expressed with all imaginable elegance and perspicuity I believe I shall advise our friend D to make more am∣ple use of this dissertation There is a translati∣on of La Motte into  prose  which is altogether  below contempt  and yet for aught I know the  only  one The word  naive  is very probably  that  for which he has substituted the word  lively  though by no means of similar import  Natural  approaches nearer it but according to La Mot∣te is not precise and as the words  Naif  and  Naiveté  seem of late to become more in vouge I will here give you an extract of what he says upon the subject  "Je ne souhaiterois plus rien à l'Auteur de Fables  ce n'est d'être fidele au sentiment de le peindre toujours avec la  Naivete  qui le caracterise car j'ose encore dis∣tinguer le  Naturel  le  Naif  Le  Naturel  renferme une idée plus vague il est opposé en général au  Recherché  au  Forcé  au lieu que le  Naif  l'est particulierement au  Réflechi  n'appartient qu'au  sentiment  "Le  sublime  selon cette idée peutêtre  Naif  La Reponse du vieil Horace à la question qu'on lui fait sur la conduite de son fils que vouliez∣vous qu'il fit contre trois  Qu'il mourut  Cette reponse est  naive  parce que c'est l'expression toute nuë du  sentiment  de ce Romain qui préfére la mort de son fils à sa honte Il ne  répond  pas précisément à ce qu'on lui demande il dit seule∣ment ce qu'il  sent  Ce n'est que dans la vers suivant que la  Reflexion  succéde à la  Naiveté  Ou qu'un beau désespoir alors le secourut  "Il  raisonne  dans ce vers il n'a fait que  sentir  dans le premier  "Les occasions du  Naif  sont peutêtre plus fréquentes dans la Fable l'eloge de La Fon∣taine est de n'en avoir gueres manquées dans la Fable du Pot au Lait le discours qu'il prêto à sa Latiere est un chesd'oeuvre de  Naiveté  d'autant plus singulier que sous  l'apparence du raisonne∣ment  le plus suivi le  sentiment  se montre dans toute sa force ou pour mieux dire dans toute son  yvresse  "  And now let me know what English word you would employ to interpret  Naif Sentimen∣tal  has some pretensions but is not wholly to one's mind  I bought the quarto edition of La Motte's Fables to which this essay is prefixed though the vaunted cuts which tempted me to this ex∣travagance did not answer my expectation The author with much address begs the Duke of Orleans to be at the expence of them which to the best of my remembrance was  "deux mille ecus"  Mr Hurd you see is one of Dr Warburton's Chaplains I bought his Dialogues Moral and Political almost as soon they were published Sir Edward Lyttelton told me the introductory one would be omitted in the next edition The three following are very ingenious but the two former are a little ambiguous in regard to his in∣tended moral the two last are wholly political and I have not yet perused them though esteem∣ed the  best  Have you seen Dr Smith's  "Theory of Mo∣ral Sentiments"  which is prodigiously commend∣ed and which I have bought but not readYou will see an account of this in the Monthly Review  I have lately been reading one or two volumes of The Rambler who excepting against some few hardnesses in his manner  He too often makes use of the Abstract for the Concrete  and the want of more examples to enliven is one of the most  nervous  most  perspicuous  most concise and most harmonious prosewriters I knowA learned diction improves by time  I am sorry to find no mention of your in all the letters which I have received of late Do not think of  dropping  or even  delaying  the publi∣cation of it only if you please before it goes to  the press let me peruse it once deliberatelyWhat think you if Dodsley approve it of ad∣mitting cuts into your scheme  And now from  cuts  I proceed to  pictures  Alcock's portrait of me is in a manner finished and has been hung up for these nine days past in its carved frame opposite to the fire place in my library  They say  it is a likeness allowing for the diminution of size Indeed if I can conclude any thing from the strong resemblance which he has produced of  others  here I may form some  conjecture  that he has not failed in mineBe this as it will the picture is upon the whole a tolerably pleasing one and this is the  most  I must dare to say considering my own person makes so large a part of it  What think you of a tawney or reddish brown for the robe or nightgown with black for the waistcoat and breeches reserving green for the curtain though green is with me at least no very gay colour nor has it that effect which you apprehended in the drapery Terrasienna is a delightful colour so I think is Roman ocre burnt Let me know then what objections you have to the drapery just now proposed Let me know also any design that you think most pleas∣ing for a background or any story of two or three figures that would be suitable for a relievo  From  pictures  I proceed to  painters  I believe Alcock would go and settle at Bath if Amos Green could be induced to join him Amos Green is the name of the painter whom I recommended to you  before my fever  He is esteemed inferior to no one in England for fruit He also paints flowers insects and deadgame  very  well To this he would adjoin the business of waterpainting Alcock would paint portraits in oil and to this he would add enamelpainting both of them  the bestnatured young fellows in the world Now suppose them also  ingenious  and tell me whether they would have a chance to  thrieve    You ought to have a very considerable  amends  if you are to be plagued with writing and with musicmastersI believe I rate your time and trouble at a much higher price than you do yourself  Dr Blackstone has raised himself to a very eminent figure indeed in the world of letters I rejoice at it without one particle of envy both as he is your friend and a person of merit I believe no one besides yourself would have dreamt of your odd analogy betwixt him and meI know not  how  they came to insert that in∣sipid Song of mine in the ChronicleWhat sensation it caused in me was that of disappro∣bation as it looked like laying stress on what one knows to be of no importance  The chief points wherein my picture varies from your drawing is in the corner below the base of the pedestal where an antique vase is introduced with a flower and two or three leaves of the scarlet Geranium The gilt vase agrees well enough with the gold fringe on the edge of the curtain but the whole is so  subdued  as not to catch the eye too strongly It was chiefly meant to obviate the disagreebleness of the  parallel  lines and angles occasioned by the step in that corner but it crowds that side a little if one look from top to bottom and though a pleasing object it is hard to say whether it does more good or harm  It is time now to take my leave with my hearty respects to Mrs Graves and with the usual assurance that I remain your most affectio∣nate and faithful friend  W SHENSTONE  Do write soon  CII To the same on his neglecting his Corres∣pondence  The Leasowes  July  Dear Mr Graves  I MUST confess that I do not altogether find your argument conclusiveAn hurry of bu∣siness  may  be necessary and somewhat incon∣sistent with frequent correspondence but a state of  leisure  which I wished you does not imply a course of  dissipation  which makes your present apology for not writing to me before And so betwixt business at one time and dissipation at another I am to be defrauded of a correspondence that is quite essential to my wellbeing Pardon me if on such occasion you find me extremely clearsighted in the foibles of my friends and do not say with the man in Horace  "Cur in ami∣corum vitiis c"  The  matter  is too  important  for me to connive at any sort of sophismHow∣ever to make you easy on this head I am con∣vinced the letter was owing to  you  for which I will draw my apology neither from  business  nor dissipation and yet how justly might I palliate my long silence upon  either  footing Since I wrote to you I have been  busied  in bringing about a conclusion with D The letters journies c  previous  and  posterior  to the execu∣tion of articles would afford me noble matter for excuseThe constant attendance upon workmen of which I have fourteen or fifteen this very day making a piece of water below my Priory would produce more on the score of  dissipation  you remember the placeThis at present is my chief employment although Al∣cock is drawing on the side of my tableI wonder you do not get some little urns turned  in any sort of wood about fourteen or fifteen inches high and painted on the side with figures in the manner of some antique bassorelievo He has done something of this sort for me You may if you so please have the ground a dark  bronze  and the figures a  light  one I am of late grown fond of bronze which you yourself may easily execute and I think it always was your tasteDodsley comes hither in about a fortnight and prints  one  edition of his Fables by means of Baskerville's press and paper  Mean time  he is to  give  me his picture done by Reynolds and to  send  me two bronzed plaister urns of about twelve inches with bassorelievo and two figures ditto of Homer and Virgil of about twentyone inches for two niches in my libra∣ry The parcel is to be pieced out with Ogilby's Virgil which I want for the sake of the land∣scapesAnd now to the particulars of your letter  I can readily conceive how much greater pleasure you must receive from the  retinue  of your journey than an Archbishop can from all his equipage and I can truly assure you I find a pleasure in every pleasure you enjoy  Your room indeed will be a noble one but be sure remember the  "Imploravit opes hominis fraenumque recepit"  and guard against itTo speak my sentiments I think you will I think with you in regard to Tristram Shandy so does the author of The Monthly Review you will see I bought Webb instantly but have not read it Lord Lyttelton is  allowedly  the author of those Dialogues whose the very last I do not know There is a noble specimen of Scotch poetry translated from the Erse languageI have had two copies sent me from Scotland and had I two franks would send you one  "Chry∣sal or the The Adventures of a Guinea"  real  characters intended will amuse you Some∣thing  ever  occurs that obstructs my travelling at alland though I long  ardently  to visit you the Lord knows when it will be yet  be  it certainly will when I accompany Mr Knight to Mr Bamfylde's where I am pressingly invited by that gentleman and his neighbours Lady Egmont Sir Charles Tynte cI have about an hundred things more to say which I must defer till I have heard from youGod bless you and yours  W SHENSTONE  CIII To the same on Dodsley's Fables and other Literary Articles  The Leasowes  Mar  Dear Mr Graves  ALTHOUGH this interval in our correspon∣dence must be placed I fear to  my  account you will hardly think it mends the matter to  fill  my present letter even with the bestground∣ed apologiesI will only mention a bad state of health which has been my lot this winter as a general excuse for two or three months silence and then declare as with truth I may that the esteem and affection which you have so well deserved of me have never undergone the least diminution or abatement It is with me a me∣lancholy task to  write  letters when I am not well although it be the time of all others when it is most necessary for me to  receive  themOur friend Dodsley I presume has sent you a book of his Fables before this time What merit I have there is in the  Essay  in the  original Fables  al∣though  I can hardly claim a single Fable as my own and in the  Index  which I caused to be thrown into the form of  Morals  and which are almost wholly mine I wish to God it may sell for he has been at great expence about it The two rivals which he has to dread are the editi∣ons of Richardson and of Croxall The  Fables  in Croxall are tolerably writen his  reflections  little to the purpose either for boys or grown peopleRichardson's  Improvement of L'Estrange  would be a better collection both for the  Fables  and the  moral Reflections  had he not admitted through an extravagant and mistaken love of drollery that vulgarity of phrase which in many places is not  common English  This I think a true state of the case say the best you can in behalf of DodsleyAs to his cuts though to  him  expensive they will hardly I fear meet with much of your approbationthe scale is much too smalland the emblematick prints which are larger will scarce I fear be understoodI pro∣cured a copy from Baskerville  before  the plates were  inserted  and have caused my painter Alcock to supply the vacancies with some devices of my ownsome account of which I send you as it may amuse you for a minute I want one or two to compleat my scheme and should be glad if you would propose some in your next letterI return you my hearty thanks for the hints you gave for the Cambridge verses but when I received them it was too late and I myself too much indisposed either to throw them into proper form or even to answer that gentleman's letter which I thought a very gen∣teel oneI know not what he did on that occa∣sion having seen neither Cambridge nor Oxford versesMr Dodsley gave me  "The Environs of London"  Between friends I wish he may find five thousand readers whom the management of that work pleases more than  me  I will try to  get you some of the  cuts  if you desire me to do so though it will reflect a kind of tacit dislike of the  whole  performanceHis brother publishes this winter  "The Works of Soame Jenyns"  in three pocketvolumes and a Chinese novel from a Ms translation revised c by a friend of mine You have perhaps heard me speak of Mr Percyhe  was  in treaty with Mr James Dodsley for the publication of our best old bal∣lads in three volumes He has a large folio Ms of ballads which he shewed me and which with his own natural and acquired talents would qualify him for the purpose as well as any man in Eng∣land I proposed the scheme for him  myself  wishing to see an elegant  edition  and good col∣lection of this kindI was also to have assisted him in selecting and rejecting and in fixing upon the best readingsBut my illness broke off our correspondence the beginning of winterand I know not what he has done sinceThere is a New Peerage going to be publishedwith I believe the draughts of the Peers housesLightholer called here and said he had taken Lord Lyttleton's and Lord Stamford's for that purposethe latter of which he shewed meThus have I told you what I hear of new  publi∣cations  as to what passes in the busy world I know no more than the Chronicle informs meunless when  your  letters happen to be  rounded  with little anecdotes from BathHave you seen Baskerville's new PrayerbooksMy Lord Dartmouth has undertaken to present two to the King and PrincessDo for  charity  sake make me some amends for this long chasm in our cor∣respondence by a very early and long letterI am sick to hear from you being with ardent and sincere affection your ever faithful friend and servant  W SHENSTONE  Our little life is  rounded  with a sleep  SHAKESPEARE  CIV To the same with some Political Anecdotes  The Leasowes  May  Dear Mr Graves  I WILL upon your last assurance take it  ever  for granted that you do not omit writing upon any score of ceremony This will render your silence at least in some  degree  less irksome to me when I do not think it the effect of my own procrastinationMr Dodsley had sold two thousand of his Fables long ago but complain∣ed that he should  lose  thirty pounds by my neighbour Baskerville's impression and that he should not be more than ten pounds gainer upon the  whole  I told him it was enough in books of  this sort  if the first edition paved the way for their future establishment in schools And surely so it is for a book of this kind once established becomes an absolute estate for many years and brings in at least as certain and as regular returns I would  wish  him to give the polite world one more edition from Baskerville's press admitting only a  new  sett of emblematical top and tailpieces and confining those empty cuts relating to each Fable to the cheap edition which he prints at London A second edition of this latter sort will appear in a little time and if you have any improvements to propose he will very thankfully receive them Mr Spence offers him to write  the life  afresh and Spence Burke Lowth and Melmoth advise him to dis∣card  Italicks  I confess he has used them to a very great  excess  but yet I do not think they should be utterly discarded  I did not intend that Mr Davenport should ever hear of those verses and how he came to do so is past my comprehension He seemed to  me to have deserted Worfield without any in∣tention to return again I therefore meant to inscribe them under my own Venus in order to afford some novelty at an  easy rate  to those who are curious enough to  repeat  their visits here Pray if you see Mr and Mrs Davenport present my best respects to them and as to the verses I will send you a copy for them if you  desire  or  advise  me so to doMr S is agreeable not void of learning has some smartness but little tasteMrs S has  much  of the latter and perhaps imagination which makes a part of taste may have had no small share in converting her to PoperyMr Powys I have almost for∣gottenYou are ingenious very inventive in regard to the means of giving yourself mortifi∣cation I dare to say your new building sug∣gests no such idea as you conceiveAnd I think it sufficient in a parsonagehouse if one sees detached specimens of taste or elegance without uniformity or even without consi∣stency  I do not find but that you  figure  among the gentry near Bath Dr Charlton who was here yesterday with Sir Francis and Mr Knight gave me an account that the B of G had been to pay his respects to you I will not enter into particulars but would wish you to cultivate his acquaintanceI shewed Sir Fran∣cis the dead colouring of the picture which I intend to send to youbut you must know that Alcock is the most volatile of all creatures that have not wings By way of improving the picture I meant for Dodsley he has made it in∣finitely less like and yet it must go to London as  it is  for God knows when he can be brought to alter it  I asked the Doctor how Mr Blackstone came to obtain a seat in Parliament and his  answer was  "The King insisted on it as he was a man of learning and ingenuity"  The enmity betwixt Lord Ln and Mr P I find conti∣nues in its full force insomuch that my Lord is to have no place while Mr P continues in the ministryMy Lord B's promotion was it seems demanded by the D of N and Mr P as they would not be exposed to bear the blame while he was the chief mover behind the curtain  These little particles of intelligence have I believe Sir for their authorI was told by another politician the same day that we were not to expect a peacethat the French who might give up the Colonies would not resign the Fishery  Mr Knight his mother and sister go through Bath to Mr Bamfylde's in about three weeks if nothing intervene I am teazed greatly to accompany themby my own  inclination  I can assure you as well as their  importunity  I do not say I will  not  nor must I ever promise you  before∣hand  that I  will  I have good reasons to the contrary They have some thoughts of bringing Dr Charlton into the party  Believe me ever yours and Mrs Graves's  W SHENSTONE  CV To the same on the intended Publication of his Works  The Leasowes  Sept  Dear Mr Graves  I OUGHT to have thanked you many weeks ago for a very  long  and  entertaining  letter the  length  of which as well as the  entertainment  was  increased by a Postscript a few days afterBut as the Winter is with me a dull and uniform season so the Summer is a time of universal dis∣sipation and very happy do I think myself when after a continual succession of company visits paid and excursions taken I can sit down in peace and quietness to attend to the business of correspondence and friendship Either reason habit or complexion tells me that I am never  otherwise  so properly employed  The last digression I made was to the concert at Worcester to hear The Messiah well per∣formed to meet a number of faces one knows but first and principally to visit your brother  without  which motive I had not gone In the two  former  respects the journey answered my expectationbut alas your brother was gone into Herefordshire I however alighted out of the chaise and the housekeeper very civilly shewed me his delightful parlour that looks in∣to the meadows the Prebend's gardens and down the Severn to Malvernhills A more agreeable townhouse cannot possibly be found any where But I regretted when I reached the inn that I had not asked to see his children for I either heard them upstairs had a glimpse of them at the window or fancied to a degree of conviction that they were most of them within the house I now return to remark upon some particulars in your letterI believe it is that indifference you complain of which is the  grand  detriment to genius in an advanced part of life In all  poetical  affairs we are too apt to cry out with Pallas  "Non est mihi tibia tanti"  And this renders all our efforts tame prosaic and judicious But this propensity as well as many others we should guard against upon the approach of age change the object of our a∣musements cherish hopes well or illgrounded  of finding that pleasure in the novelty of objects which we have not found in any individual These are the means of  preserving our vivacity  a somewhat longer time than it naturally lasts but how far it is  prudent  to attach ourselves to the world that we must leave is a point which  you  better can determine Refined taste as it im∣plies a  love  of physical beauty has this tendency  There is nothing can be more rational than what you say about the expediency of  losing no time  if I mean to collect and publish what I have written You are indeed very partial to my abilities but allowing for  that  what you mention  coincides  with what I have thought my∣self and this for some years past A more agreeable kind of  distraction  in summer and an indifferent state of health and spirits in winter have hitherto prevented any progress in the cor∣rection of my pieces To these I might add a  suspence  about the compositions and the manner proper for publication I am now most inclin∣ed to make a collection of the whole I mean the best of what are already printed or in Ms to publish them by subscription in a large  quar∣to  size for the sake of profit and to apologize for this method by mentioning the expence of top and tailpieces with which I mean they shall be embellished Some of  these  by the bye may be taken from my farm the rest emblema∣tical in an easy and careless but at the same time elegant manner I should think the in∣stance of Mr Pope might render this method not disreputable and it might be advertised as was done by Mr Spence that unless a certain number were subscribed for the whole affair should be no farther prosecuted This would put it in the way of many friends to serve me who I flatter myself  with inclination  esteem themselves void of  opportunity  Let me beg you  to think seriously of this as well as of a general titlepage before you write again  Thank you kindly for all the little diverting anecdotes that are contained in your letter I am glad to hear your  place  brings you company partly as it tends to amuse you and yet more as it tends to make your merit more conspicuous You and I have led a life of total disinteress∣ment Let me advise you to seek some  advantage  from your commerce with  great men  The boy who was here with you and Mrs Graves was here last Friday evening with a Mr Jolliffe and his son the latter of whom observed your name upon the bench and seemed proud to de∣clare that he was once your schoolfellow Mr Stratford to whom I had written about some goldfishes says in his answer  "I had the plea∣sure from Bath of waiting upon Mr G and was as much satisfied with the miniature beau∣ties of his place as with the polite reception I met with from the owner"  If you have an oppor∣tunity you will oblige me by presenting my com∣pliments to that gentlemanI met Dr Charlton at Worcester who stands high in my esteemThe account of Gothic architecture c is cu∣rious but I have found it in Dr Warburton's edition of PopeI inclose the verses on the Venus de MedicisI told you before my in∣tentions c concerning them and since I hear that they have appeared in some one of the Magazinesthrough Dodsley's or Percy's means for I surely gave a copy to nobody besidesand those copies must be much imperfectMy picture shall be sent to you as soon as I can pos∣sibly get Alcock over who has promised to come every week for these three months past I believe he  will  come soonI did not know of Mr Warton's compliment but he is very obliging to me on all occasions and sends me  all that he publishesI have not yet read Dr Robertson's History to my shame be it spoken though I have the honour to know the authorI hope the King  will  oblige the Irish Peers with a place in the procession as that people seem greatly out of temper and I fear not without some reason  I see my friend Dodsley has  let off  his little  squib  upon the marriage in the Chronicle  "  The King sought a partner  " c  and last night was brought me from Baskerville's press on the same occasion very  pompously  printed the most despi∣cable Grubstreet I ever saw  I have made some little improvements about my place have taken away the wall in front and made a handsome ring have extended my path in one piece of ground greatly for the bet∣terbut the grand water in the valley will make no figure till next spring  I have also assisted my friend Hull the come∣dian in altering the Tragedy of Rosamond had it brought upon the stage to a full house at Bir∣mingham where it was very well received put Hull into a way of making an indirect compli∣ment to the present King in the ten last lines of his Epilogue which was followed by  "God save great George" c  in a full chorus of the audi∣ence and actors drawn out abreast upon the stage  Since this there has been deposited in my hands a large collection of Poetry by a Miss Wheatly of Walsall many of the pieces writ∣ten in an excellent and truly classical style sim∣ple sentimental harmonious and more correct than I almost ever saw written by a lady They will be published I believe by subscription un∣der the patronage of Lord Dartmouth  But nothing in the poetical way has pleased me better than a compliment which I received  about nine days ago by the post under the feigned name  Cotswouldia  She must be some Gloustershire lady that has seen the place as she raises up a Fairy in my grove into whose mouth she puts the compliment It seems writ∣ten by somebody of fashion by the styleCan you form any conjecture  There was a Mr Freeman of Betstow or some such name with two or three ladies in a coach and fix that were here not long before a very genteel and polite young man  I really know not how to stop when I begin a letter to  you  and it is one reason why I look upon the task as too considerable to be under∣taken at all times Pray write soon and believe me wholly yours and Mrs Graves's  W SHENSTONE  CVI To the same suggesting to him a Subject for  Poetry  The Leasowes  May  Dear Mr Graves  I FIND you will  not  write unless I give a re∣gular answer to your letters and yet God knows I have a better excuse for my delay than I wish my friend to have for his punctilioI mean indispositionWhence it has happened I cannot say unless I may blame these continual east winds but I have suffered more from the smiles of spring than I have really done from the frowns of winter  Having premised thus much I lay your letter before me The expence of printing a sheet of those commendatory verses at a common press is eighteen shillings and at Baskerville's about  three pounds ten shillings nor do I mean any decorations unless perhaps  "The Kingfisher"  or  "View of my Grove"  which you know I  have  engraven ready to  my  hands So you see that  this  offering to vanity is not likely to be the most expensive  I wish you had bestowed somewhat more at∣tention upon  the title  in which  case  I really be∣lieve the job had been executed long ago Pray be so kind as to reconsider itIs not  "The Garland of Friendship"  a little too quaint for that as I remember was what I proposedThe  motto  which you proposed was a very good one and I think also that the addition of the next line would be an improvement to it  "et isti er∣rori nomen virtus posuisset honestum"  But I do not love  double  mottoes so if I admit this I must exclude what I proposed which to speak the truth was of my own invention  The custom of prefixing commendatory verses to collections of poetry is now seemingly grown obsolete Besides in my case they would only shew that I had  taken  up more fame than my funds would answer I return you many thanks for  your  poetical benevolence but why do you mention it under the name of  Epigram  I do not even chuse that it should have the air of  simile  from the  beginning    Lo the tall youth by partial fate's decree  To affluence born and from restraint set free  How pleased he c  I have taken  this  and some  other  liberties with it and shall insert it among the rest unless you chuse to  redeem  it with something more to your satisfaction for to speak with frank∣ness I think it better calculated to do  me  honour than  yourself  though I could esteem it  good  if it  came from a person whose abilities I respected less than yours There is a subject here which I would recommend to you if by so doing I should lay you under no  restraint  It is my principal cascade Its appearance well resem∣bles the playfulness of infancy skipping from side to side with a thousand antic motions that answer no other purpose than the mere amuse∣ment of the proprietorOther similitudes c would here occur  Cui enim nascenti faciles arriserunt Musae c  It then proceeds a few hundred yards where it  rolls  and  slits iron  for manufactures of all kinds resembling the graver toils of manhood either in acquiring money or furnishing the conveni∣encies comforts or ornaments of life and in this manner it proceeds under the name of The Stour supplying works for casting forging and and shaping iron for every civil or military pur∣pose Perhaps you may not know that my rills are the principal sources of this river or that this river supplies  more  ironworks than almost any single river in the kingdom for so my friend Mr Knight told me  The Mr D you enquire after and who wrote the  best  address Sir Robert Walpole ever  received  is Mr DodingtonDid I never send you a list of all the concealed names in that Mis∣cellanyI began to transcribe one from my own set but find one part of my list is lost I however send it and will piece it out when I find an opportunity as I purpose also to give you some account of our several merits of Dod∣sley's Fables By the way do not the verses to Dr Cornwallis now Bishop affect you sensibly vol VI p they do  me  whenever I read them and I cannot help applying them to my∣self  I feel somewhat of the same sensation when I read  "The Letters of Henry and Fran∣ces"  in which from selfpartiality no doubt I find myself extremely like Henry  Pray let me hear if you please of Mr Daven∣portI wish I had learnt to  draw  well in early lifeIt would have given me some very great advantages Let me hear also much of Mr Melmoth who I presume has left you long be∣fore this time I did once design to have sent you down my proposals for a subscription and requested the favour of  you two  to settle them finally without any further reference to myself but my head and spirits have been too bad to undertake even a common letterWhat think you of Dr Lowth's GrammarLivie met him at Mr Dodsley's and says he is well pleased with  our  frontispiece c to Horace Livie could not present his book to Lord Bute  himself  on account of my Lord's indisposition Mr Dalton Dr Dalton's brother who teaches the K to draw presented it It seems this Dr Dalton who gave the drawing of Lord Bute's arms has lodgings in the palace and sees the King every day  While  Livie was  with  him word came that the King was coming into his room upon which Livie was sent out another wayThe King asked Dalton whom he had with himand was answered an editor of Horace who had inscribed it to Lord ButeDalton is to present a copy to the King  I inclose to you a specimen of the decorated parts of Horace with the frontispieceThe book will be published in a month's time when I mean you a copy from those that are allotted to me  My Lord Bute's arms are unexceptionably well finishedThe other plates either through negligence or the wilfulness of the designer and  engraver have given me infinite trouble and vexation However with about  twothirds  of my directions observed they will I hope afford you some pleasure and discover somewhat more  beauty  and  spirit  than one commonly finds in such designsSend me your remarks very particularly I beseech you  W S  CVII To the same  The Leasowes  Nov  Dear Mr Graves  DO I really owe you an apology you who are embarrassed with such a number of momentous concerns as hardly allow a fair trial to letters of mere amusement Alas I cannot shelter my long silence under a supposi∣tion of this kind I believe I even  hope  that you have disapproved my long neglect as I can very faithfully assure you I have repeatedly done  myself  There are certain times and sea∣sons when I have not either the  power  or the  will  to write as Hannibal said about attacking Rome  "quandoque memtem non dari quan∣doque potestalem"  This being an intellec∣tual kind of  lethargy  it would have been at least a friendly office if you had  rouzed  me as you  might  have done by a supernumerary let∣ter I never receive a line from you but I feel an almost irresistible propensity to answer it that very instant Impediments sometimes occur and that instant being neglected matter is accumulated for a longer letter than I am always resolute enough to undertake at the same time I can never content myself with uttering one half of what I have to sayPray  is not that  good sort of man  to whom you allude a Mr K Let him be ever so good a sort of man in the common estimation I dare aver him to be neither an ingenious person nor a candid critic There may be fifty or more preferable readings to what are received in this new Ho∣race yet he will find a better  text  there  upon the whole  than in any one edition before ex∣tant As to the  beauty  of  type  and  presswork  it is too obvious to need vindication The accu∣racy of the  latter  almost exceeds what was ever found in any other book Then as to the  fron∣tispiece  it is I think much superior to such as  ordinarily  occur the  subject  animated and well chosen and the  execution  very commendable at least if we allow for the  nice  touches which it required and the  uncommon difficulty  of getting any thing of this kind done to one's direction  Mr Walpole is a lively and ingenious writer not always accurate in his determinations and much less so in his language too often led away by a desire of routing prejudices and de∣stroying giants And yet there is no province wherein he appears to more advantage in  gene∣ral  than in throwing new light upon Characters in British History I wish he would compose a regular work making this his principal point He has with great labour in his Book of Pain∣ters recorded matter of little importance re∣lative to people that were of less I have a right to be severe for his volumes cost me above thirty shillings yet where he drops the  anti∣quarian  in them his remarks are striking and worth perusalI have sent for  "Gesner's Rural Poems"  and intend to see  "The Death of Abel"  though I expect to find small plea∣sure in this  poetical prose  unless exquisitely well tunedThank you for the anecdote of Lord Courtney a thousand such sort of things that  engage the public attention are never capable of penetrating the depth of my retirement  Mr Melmoth you will probably see often as he intends to make Bath his place of residence  The  Omphale  you sent me is a most excellent figure and I shall wish much to get a good cast of it at least when I am able to afford itWhen I write again I will give you the best account I can of  my share  in Dodsley's new Fables though it will be no easy matter to speak  separately  of it with any precision  And now I think I have spoke to most of the articles in your last letterMr Dodsley who says he visited you would acquaint you how we divided our time whilst he was here into two  principal  parts  "l'un à dormir l'autre à ne rien faire"  Yet we paid our devoirs to a good deal of genteel company of which this season has afforded me at  least  an equal share with any that went before I will particularize a few opening the list with no less personages than the Duke and Dutchess of RichmondMr Walsh member for WorcesterEarl of Bath with Dr Monson Mrs Montague who wrote the three last Dialogues printed with Lord Lyt∣telton's and other company from HagleySir Richard

leave so little room to speak about the individualsLord M appeared to me ra∣ther a  man of wit  than a  man of taste  Baron Smythe the reverseMr and Mrs Morrice extremely polite and agreeable people invited me pressingly to their habitation I could not help reflecting on the singular happiness of Mr Morrice to be possessed at once of a large fortune one of the finest situations in England and a wife whose taste for rural improvements appears even superior to his own at least if the  beauty  of her  person  did not impose upon my judgement There are many others whom I would distinguish if my time or paper would permitI suppose that you and Mr Dodsley would be mighty unanimous with regard to the propriety of setting my subscription on footI do not dispute any of your argumentsthey tally exactly with my own opinion at least al∣lowing for the higher idea you have of my pieces than they deservethe truth is that I have deferred the publication too long  already  till many of the compositions will not ap∣pear to the same advantage as before and till I have not half the power that I had formerly to improve them When I am lowspirited I almost shudder at this tremendous contract  with the publick when my spirits are elevated I see the necessity that you do of not losing a moment's timewere you here a week you would put the matter upon a footing that was unalterableWould to God you  were  here or any one  like  you however it is probable you will  soon  hear from me again upon this very subjectI  know  this that  if  I print at  all  the subscription is by no means to be neglected this present winterI have seen our friend Dr Charlton many times this season at The Leasowes at Mr Knight's at his own house and at my Lord Foley's This visit to my Lord Foley's was performed about three weeks ago I went with young Knight and the company of the Doctor and Sir Francis Charlton took off all restraint and made the visit perfectly agreeable My Lord's behaviour was entirely free and hospitable and his conversation lively and entertainingI must confess far beyond the idea which I have been taught to conceive of himHis table the most magnificent I believe of any nobleman's for thirty miles roundHis park and Wooberyhill adjacent afford views that are either extensive wild beautiful or grand The portico before his lodge deserves particular noticehis house large and commodious and well furnished but scarce any of the rooms  high  enough to stand the test of modern criticism But what strikes more than all the rest is the magnifi∣cence of his Chapelwhich however I can∣not stay to describe for I this very  moment  receive your letterAfter having written so much before I can only touch upon some few particularsI believe my scheme of publica∣tion will proceed in a little time and that you will soon hear from me againIf you can possibly excuse me to Mr Davenport and  keep me well with him for a week or fort∣night I will not fail to write him a respect∣ful letter I am truly ashamed of my neglect but have written more letters within this week than I have done for a quarter of a year be∣foreThat there is a faction forming against Lord B I really believeThe war may suit the  world and the City of Lon∣don has generally the art to represent the  landed  and  trading  interest as  precisely  the same thingBut I think there is a very material dif∣ference which it would be no way difficult to demonstrateat least I am one that cry out  Nulla salus bello pacem te poseimus omnes  I am quite unacquainted with the affair relating to Colonel Wilkes and Lord Bute's sonAnd now though I mean to write again soon I will release you from this unpleasing scrawlI beg however that you would not fail to write to me  directly  if you can find leisure being quite impatient to converse with you after such a chasm in our correspondence and being with unvariable affection my dear friend for ever yoursPray my best respects to Mrs Graves  W SHENSTONE  My friend Dr Grainger has written a Poem in blank verse which he calls  "The SugarCane"  It is divided into four booksand is capable of being  rendered  a good Poem My friend Jago has written another Poem in blank verse also which he calls  "Edgehill"  It is descriptive chiefly of the prospectbut admits an account of  the sight  there and many little  and  with compliments also to the gentry of WarwickshireIt lies now upon my table  CVIII To Mr JAGO    My dear friend  A THOUSAND thanks to you for the very obliging and humorous Poem which you are so kind to send me I really think it very ingenious and upon the whole ex∣tremely correct although I have taken the li∣berty of proposing one or two hints for farther improvement The relation that it bears to me and my place  may  tend to prejudice my  judgement  but I cannot conceive that it requires aught beside  impartiality  to relish the beauties of this Poem I beg I may receive a fair copy in your own hand as soon as possible and I will consider in the mean time how to shew it to the publick in the most advantageous manner It certainly does me  honour  as things are at present circumstanced it may  tend  to do me  good  which I am very sure you would be glad to see I am a little ashamed to be so much behindhand with you in favours of  this  and  other  kinds but I live in hopes there may come a day when I shall find occasion to express my gratitude The pictures you sent arrived safe on Thursday and have been since cleaned and put up in their places I can∣not enter upon this subject now finding it almost six o'clock at night and having just received a letter from Mr Dodsley which he requires me to answer by return of post It relates to the  scheme  mentioned in his last which is intended for my emolument but which I must not expect to succeed without considerable mortification This  inter nos  You must by no means lay aside the thoughts of  perfecting  Edgehill  at your leisure It is pos∣sible that in order to keep clear of flattery I have said less in its favour than I really  ought  but I never considered it otherwise than as a Poem which it was very adviseable for you to com∣pleat and  finish  I am now to desire my best respects to Mrs Jago and to bid you an affec∣tionate adieu  Tu comes antiquus tu primis junctus ab annis  I am my dear friend ever yours with the truest esteem  W SHENSTONE  Dec  CIX To SHERRINGTON DAVENPORT  Esq  The Leasowes  Jan  Dear Sir  MR G tells me that you have done me the honour to lay some stress upon re∣ceiving a letter from me Alas it must be owing purely to your benevolence which makes you wish to hear of an absent friend and not to any expectations you can reasonably form of entertainment from his pen The long letter with which you favoured me was so very lively as well as ingenious that I despaired of draw∣ing from my fountains the vivacity you do from the Bathwaters But be this as it will the vein of friendship that runs through your letter demands my amplest acknowledgements and if you will accept of  such  returns I pro∣mise they will be as  hearty  as they are  insipid  I agree with you that the first sallies of ima∣gination will generally prove the most sprightly  and that they will often comprehend the prin∣cipal features of a subject They are of the nature of deadcolouring in a portrait which one sometimes thinks more spirited than the same performance when finished And yet a  good  painter will not  hurt  a portrait by the sub∣sequent labour he bestows upon it nor will a  good  writer injure his piece by the pains he takes to round and perfect it It must be some de∣fect in the taste of either that makes his dili∣gence detrimental or gives occasion for a stan∣derby to cry out  "Manum de tabula"  I be∣lieve it will appear upon examination that works which cost most labour have generally been thought the  easiest  and pleased the  longest  One cannot however deny that there is a sort of persons formed by nature for  shooting flying  which by the way I could never  do  and that their sallies of imagination are what they can hardly improve by any future pains These may be called men of wit and fire but it is the union of  taste  with these that constitutes fine writing True taste will never stiffen or overcharge any performance it will rather be employed to smooth simplify and give that ease on which  grace  depends One can as little deny that there are  kinds  of writing which have a better chance than others to succeed without much labour which start forth mature at  first  as Pallas did from the brain of Jupiter Works of  humour  are often of this sort and there are many instances in Butler's Hudibras Yet I think the humour of  Swift  was greatly owing to a judicious  revisal  Pardon me my dear friend for this tedious discussion which you little thought of bringing upon yourself by the obliging hint you gave concerning those verses upon Venus I do acknowledge that an additional stanza there containing a reflexion on Chinese architecture were better laid aside  It seemed to me one of the  "splendi da pec∣cata"  that might be a little  popular  at this  time  and has therefore for this season ap∣peared on a board by the side of the Venus We who cannot erect fresh temples or even add a new gardenseat every spring are obliged to make the most we can of a new and toler∣able copy of verses that costs us  thought  in∣stead of  money  and even at a pinch to piece out a dull scene with duller poetry how else could I keep my place in countenance so near the pompous piles of Hagley And yet there are few  fashionable  visitants that do not shew an  affection  for the little Amoret as much as they admire the stately Sacharissa  "plerumque gratae  divitibus vices  "  I have often considered why those possessed of palaces yet esteem a roothouse or a cottage as a desirable object in their gardensIs it not from having experi∣enced the imperfection of happiness in higher life that they are led to  conceive  it more com∣pleat beneath a roof of straw where perhaps it may really be as defective as in the apart∣ments of a King or a MinisterA thousand thanks to you and Mrs Davenport for the ac∣commodations you so kindly offer me Expe∣rience will no more suffer me to question the  cordiality  than the politeness of your reception What an amusing picture have you given of Bath pleasures carried to the utmost height and opiates ready when one is cloyed with pleasures And yet let me confess a truth you have  lightly  touched upon those  very  articles which would prove to me the most  specifically  pleasing For can any temptation be stronger than to say that  you  reside there and does not my friend G reside at Claverton of whose genius and friendship I have had proofs these twenty years past and have you not Mr Webb and now Mr Melmoth to make Bath  enviable  for the residence of literature What a joy would it afford me to go on a party with you to Percefield whither Mr and Mrs Morrice gave me the most pressing invitationsThese surely are pleasures of whichI  hope  one day to partake  My health generally bad in winter and spring has hitherto been tolerable The  in∣fluenza  of last spring continued to depress me half the summer Would you think the verses I inclosed were written on that occasion by a young journeyman shoemaker and one that lives at the village of Rowley near me He considered my disorder in somewhat too  grave  a light as I did not think my life endangered by it but allowing for this and the  partiality  he shews  me  you will think the lines pretty extra∣ordinary for one of  his occupation  They are not however the  only  or perhaps the  chief  specimens of his genius and yet before he came to me his principal knowledge was drawn from  Magazines  For these two or three years past I have lent him Classics and other books in English You see to  him  I am a great Mae∣cenas although you and my friend expect me to become an author by subscriptionOn this head I will say no more at  present  than that I am infinitely obliged by your extreme friendly offers My friend G who knows my sen∣timents has sometimes the honour of waiting on you I ought not therefore after this tedi∣ous epistle to begin to trouble you with a written explanation of them Believe me dear Sir with my most respectful compliments to Mrs Davenport  Your ever obliged and most obedient servant W SHENSTONE  I will send you some other of Woodhouse's verses when I can get him to transcribe them  CX To Mr JAGO  The Leasowes  Jan  Dear Mr Jago  MY last letter must have been confused and the arrival of it I fear uncertain  The hare and birds in one of the pictures which you sent me I think are well The other parts of it indifferent They grey hound worst of all The portrait is by no means equal to its companion either in beauty of the person or skill of the painter yet it matches so well with the other that I find my parlour very much em∣bellished by it Pardon the freedom with which I criticise your present and accept once more my very thankful acknowledgements  I am truly glad to find so worthy a Nobleman and so warm a friend of yours as my Lord Willoughby is made a Lord of the Bedcham∣ber  I have heard nothing since I wrote last in re∣gard to  my  affair though I expect to do so every day I have such a tribe of humours and pecu∣liarities that it is easier to make me rich than to make me happy and ten to one that the favour will not be conferred without disgusting some of these said humours c However one must make the best of it and reflect that mortifica∣tions in one place may preclude mortifications in another  I go tomorrow by appointment to Enville where I may probably stay till Saturday I have wished most heartily for a copy of your Fable to take with me but Dodsley has not yet returned that I sent him Pray consider my proposed al∣terations rather as hints than real improvements and let me have a copy as soon you can I wrote my criticism over twice and know not whether I sent the best or the worst copy so I send the  other though perhaps much the same I forgot to particularize many shining parts in your little Fable that are either elegant or humourous of the former sort nothing could be happier than what you say about H as it touches in the  gentlest  manner on a possible truth which if expressed rather than implied might not be al∣together inoffensive This beauty is produced by substituting H instead of L the place in∣stead of the proprietor  I have lately read  "The Death of Abel"  It is not void of merit but might have been made much more pathetic by a more simple and prosaic style  I desire my best respects to Mrs Jago and your familyMay not I see you here this Christmas as I wish to do because it is the season present and not that I am not at all times and at all sea∣sons most unseignedly glad to wait upon you and most affectionately your ever faithful ser∣vant  Tecum etenim longos memini consumere soles  Et tecum primas epulis decerpere noctes  Unum opus requiem pariter disponimus ambo c  Your kind remembrance of me in your Edge∣hill has brought these quotations into my head Adieu  W SHENSTONE  CXI To the same  Jan  My good friend  I AM suspicious that my letters of which I have sent two do not reach you by the way  of Warwick This is meant as an experiment whether they will arrive by way of Southam It is meant withall to remind you of perfecting your little Fable and dispatching it to me as soon as may be I would fain transmit a copy to Lord S's before the family separates or leaves Enville by whom I am sure it would be admired  I am just returned from a visit which I made there and four or five days passed very happily At coming away I shewed my Lord two or three of Mr D's last letters which laid open to him the scheme that was carrying on for me I requested also if there should be occasion which there possibly might  not  that he would allow me the honour of being known to him He said  "he was glad to find what was going forward and had long wished to see something of that sort begun before that he should be in town I think in February and would do me any service in his power He desired me also to acquaint Mr D in allusion to the latter's uncertainty about my Lord's political connexi∣ons that he thought it the duty of every honest man to support the present Government and that he should continue his regard for the Mini∣ster so long as he saw nothing in his measures that was prejudicial to his Country"  I know that you will take a friendly part in any good that may befall me Pray write be it ever so carelessly and believe me ever yours and Mrs Jago's most affectionate and faithful  W S  The writer survived the date of this letter but a short time his death happening on the eleventh of the following month to the inex∣pressible grief of his more intimate friends and  the generous concern of those who too late acquainted with his merit were indulging themselves in the pleasing thought of having provided for his future ease and tranquil en∣joyment of life  THE END
