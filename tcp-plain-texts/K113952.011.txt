NOVEMBER AN ODE  DIstant to southern climes the sloping sun  Hastens to bend his rays beyond the line  Where Sagittary puts his armour on  Slung is the quiver where his arrows shine  His azure bow reflects the solar beam  While his bright darts across th' horizon gleam  Now first the woodcock near the gelid stream  Seeks his known haunt amid th' embrowned copse  Where cruel fowlers take their deadly aim  Inglorious triumph see the victim drops  Forbear your savage sportoh spare ye swains  The new adventurers on Britannia's plains  Now sharper bites the hyperborean blast  While eager morning chills us at the dawn  With drizzling sleet the sky is overcast  And the white frost bespangles o'er the lawn  The wellnapp'd drugget cloaths the rural folk  And homely cots display a thicker smoke  Come Myra since the woods have lost their shade  Since undelighting are the hills and plains  Quit we the villas while their glories fade  To seek the town where gayer pleasure reigns  But if the villas still delight my fair  Welcome the howling grove and brumal air  She like Content can bless the barren heath  Her presence bids the shaggy mount be smooth  For where she treads fresh herbage springs beneath  And Myrtles blow in spite of Winter's tooth  The rugged North acknowledging her charms  Suspends his anger and his blast disarms  NOVEMBER A PASTORAL ELEGY  WHat means honest shepherd this cloud on thy brow  Say where is thy mirth and thy melody now  Thy pipe thrown aside and thy looks full of thought  As silent and sad as a bird newly caught  Has any misfortune befallen thy flocks  Any lambs been betray'd by the craft of the fox  Or murrain more fatal just seiz'd on thy herd  Or has thy dear Phillis let slip a cross word  The season indeed may to musing incline  Now that greybearded Winter makes Autumn resign  The hills all around us their russet put on  And the skies seem in mourning for loss of the sun  The winds make the tree where you sit shake its head  Yet tho' with dry leaves mother Earth's lap is spread  Her bosom to cheer us is verdant with wheat  And the woods can supply us both pastime and meat  O no says the shepherd I mourn none of these  Content with such changes as heaven shall please  Tho' now we have got the wrong side of the year  'Twill turn up again and fresh beauties appear  But the loss that I grieve for no time can restore  Our master who lov'd us so well is no more  That oak which we hop'd would long shelter us all  Is fallen then well may we shake at its fall  Where find we a Pastor so kind and so good  So careful to feed us with wholesomest food  To watch for our safety and drive far away  The sly prowling fox always lurking for prey  O may his remembrance for ever remain  To shame those hard shepherds who mindful of gain  Only look at their sheep with an eye to their fleece  And watch them no more than the fox watch'd the geese  Whom now shall I chuse for the judge of my song  Or must my poor pipe on the willow be hung  No more to commend that goodnature and sense  Which always could please but ne'er once give offence  What honour directed he firmly pursued  Yet would not his judgment on others obtrude  Still ready to help with his service and vote  But ne'er to thrust oar in another man's boat  No more honest shepherd these sorrows resound  The virtues thou praisest so hard to be found  Are yet not all fledfor the swain who succeeds  To his fields and his herds is true heir to his deeds  His pattern he'll follow his gentleness use  Take care of the shepherds and cherish the muse  Then cease for the dead thy impertinent care  Rejoicehe revives in his brother and heir  ON THE BANISHMENT OF CICERO  BY THE LATE DUKE OF WHARTON  WRITTEN IN MDCCXII  AS o'er the Ocean's swelling tide  Tully an exile rode  The Roman bulwark and the pride  In act in thought a god  The sacred Genius of majestic Rome  Descends and thus laments her Patriot's doom  Farewell who every art reviv'd  Thus conquer'd by thy foe  Of honours and of friends depriv'd  An exile must thou go  Yet go content thy look thy mind sedate  Thy soul superior to the shocks of Fate  Thy wisdom was thine only crime  Thy virtue thine offence  With patriot zeal in urgent time  Thy country's best defence  No fordid bribe could taint thy spotless soul  No fears nor threatening numbers could controul  What tho' some chief Patricians stood  Firm to thy injur'd cause  What tho' thyself display'd the flood  Of eloquence and laws  No rhetoric no reason could repel  The united tides of Clodius and of Hell  Thy mighty ruin to effect  What plots had been devis'd  Rome's charter like a vessel wreckt  Nor laws nor rituals priz'd  How many caitiff wretches were allur'd  And witnesses by hopes and threats secur'd  And yet they pleaded Freedom's light  Beneath a thin disguise  Pleaded a specious show of right  From treachery and lies  Assum'd of Freedom the judicial awe  And coin'd severe oppression into law  Let Clodius now in conquest reign  Exert his tyrant power  And every nerve of justice strain  The pageant of an hour  Let cringing fools adore their gilded god  And ransack shrines and temples at his nod  Pierc'd by a Milo's ruthless hand  To earth he shall descend  The bane and monster of the land  Inglorious at his end  Priz'd be the man who dares his power defy  Who dares or truly speak or bravely die  ON THE LATE BISHOP ATTERBURY'S PREACHING  WRITTEN IN MDCCXIII BY THE SAME  WHen our great Lord at Emmaus appear'd  Expounding what the prophets had averr'd  And when he vanish'd from his hearer's eyes  To meet the Father in his native skies  How was each heart with sudden heat inspir'd  With rapture seiz'd and grace seraphic fir'd  Scarce fainter transports all my powers controul  Glow in my breast and triumph in my soul  So strongly Rochester attracts the sense  And binds with every chain of eloquence  How can my ecstasies in verse be shown  This asks the tongue of angelsor his own  Let Nature's rival Art her tints apply  The silent poetry of painting try  To the stretch'd canvas graceful vigour give  And teach the animated form to live  To thought add figure to ideas frame  And to bright sentiment a robe of flame  So may succeeding times the merit raise  And as upon the breathing piece they gaze  At once the prelate and the painter praise  Here artist here the powerful preacher show  And let electrified attention glow  Catch the bright flames which from his lips distill  And strike out all the teacher with thy quill  Oh couldst thou echolike his words repeat  Soft as the dews of heaven as honey sweet  Severest truths so forcibly exprest  And manly sense in easy language drest  Couldst thou like his a voice melodious join  As soft as clear as powerful and divine  Couldst thoubut oh nor words nor colours can  By sounds or painting typify the man  So Athens once on her fam'd preacher hung  Transported by the music of his tongue  So stood St Paul so skilful Raphael drew  And as in him a living Paul we view  Another Raphael we should find in you  NOTHING  BY THE REV MR BELSHAM  INSCRIBED TO MR J BOWLES  NO Muses I implore their aid to bring  He needs no Muse who Nothing has to sing  Your favour Bowles and your attention lend  Pardon the Poet and protect the friend  Nothing accepttho' small the gift may seem  The wise have Nothing highly in esteem  A theme untouch'd before inspires my lays  From which no poet ever won the bays  Those Greek and Roman bards of old admir'd  Who with poetic fury nobly fir'd  On every subject dar'd their genius try  And drank the Heliconian fountain dry  Left Nothing to be sung in times to comes  Nothing escap'd the wits of Greece and Rome  When the fierce Goths did war with learning wage  And ravag'd Italy with barbarous rage  When all things good and great one ruin shar'd  Nothing by Goths was honour'dNothing spar'd  Nothing in war is sacred and we see  Nothing in peace securewith France's guaranty  Who Nothing holds conscious no danger's near  May travel every road without a fear  No long litigious suits his ease molest  Nor cares of wealth distract his anxious breast  No noise nor hurries of the town he knows  But silent lives in undisturb'd repose  Nor swell'd with hopes nor tost with anxious fears  Like a calm stream serenely roll his years  And when untroubled all his days are past  Who Nothing has to leave securely breathes his last  Nothing to prize philosophers profess  To be the only way to happiness  And he that Nothing knew was the most wise  Or the great oracle of Phoebus lies  By knowing Nothing learnt with perfect ease  Each prating fool becomes a Socrates  All other arts now flourish now decay  This learning spreads and prospers every day  The learn'd in books we know can hardly live  But to know Nothing is the way to thrive  To this our youth apply with early zeal  To shine at court and serve the commonweal  Who Nothing knowgrow noble rich and great  In senates councils army church and state  Immortal Newton tho' his towering mind  Travers'd the worlds of knowledge unconfin'd  Saw where the secret springs of science rise  And stretch'd his head like Atlas to the skies  Trac'd all the stars and search'd the source of light  And still to unknown regions wing'd his flight  Yet pardon me great Shade the truth I tell  Nothing thy grasping genius could excell  See where the learned alchymists explore  Nature's hid force and try the shining ore  Enwrapp'd in clouds of sulphurous smoke they tire  The stubborn brass and ply the torturing fire  And big with expectation night and day  Melt all their time and all their lands away  Of all this charge and toil compute the gains  Nothing excites their hopesNothing rewards their pains  Nothing is fairer than the morning light  When the fresh beams first strike the ravish'd sight  Nothing is milder than th' approach of Spring  That makes all nature smile the whole creation sing  Far as the earth and air and seas extend  Nothing's without beginning without end  Beyond the universe it finds a place  And Nothing fills the mighty void of space  On Nothing turn the lucid orbs above  Where all the stars in mystic order move  On Nothing hangs this vast terraqueous ball  The world from Nothing sprangfrom Nothing came forth all  ODE TO AMANDA ON HER THREATENING TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY IN AUTUMN  BY TM ESQ  STay lovely maid our fate delay  Yet yet a while suspend our doom  Thine eyes supply the shortening day  And save us from the hastening gloom  While thou art here we still shall see  The fields the groves the meadows wear  Their gayest dress to honour thee  Then quit them till the rising year  As yet the tepid Zephyrs sport  And wanton in the leafy grove  As yet the nymphs and swains resort  To dales and woods to talk of love  The little birds in every glade  With tuneful vows their mates accost  Secure of summer and of shade  Nor dread the piercing wintry frost  Ah pretty fools ye little know  How soon your happiness must end  Cruel Amanda wilt thou go  And rob them of their only friend  Wilt thou the sun and summer fly  They only stay to wait on thee  And horrid Winter watches nigh  Impatient till thou set him free  Then will these verdant lawns and groves  With cheerless frosts be cover'd o'er  The nymphs and swains forget their loves  And birds and poets sing no more  Stella who never sues in vain  And poor Melissus beg thy stay  O hear the suppliant nymph and swain  And cheat grim Winter of his prey  THE RATTLE A SONG  WRITTEN AT ERTHIGHALL IN DENBIGHSHIRE BY MISS CHARLOTTE BRERETON MDCCXXXII AND ADDRESSED TO DANIEL IVEY ESQ  I'll sing you a balladO that it were merry  Tho' not of the abbot of Canterbury  Nor yet of those heroes presume I to sing  Who at Windsor once frighten'd the ghost of a king  Derry down c  Nor sing I the fiddle which oft at Longleate  Hath charm'd all its hearers with music so sweet  Nor that merry Bard will I mention at all  Who to the same tune took a trip to Downhall  Derry down c  My ballad is not full soon you will know it  Of abbot or hero or fiddle or poet  But it is of a sprightly most whimsical Rattle  Who exceeds all us women in chat and in prattle  Derry down c  This Rattle of Rattles if he is inclin'd  Can suit well his converse to every one's mind  He never is foolish not wise out of season  To the gay he chats nonsense to the grave he talks reason  Derry down c  The worst thing I ever observ'd in this Rattle  Is that to the Priesthood he's apt to give battle  I'm quite out of tune when he these makes a farce on  For who knows but I may in time wed a Parson  Derry down c  We women are apt to digress as I find  When dear self or a Parson comes into one's mind  May the Reverends in safety and sanctity rest all  And may I continue at Erthig a Vestal  Derry down c  But as I was saying this Rattle hath said  If he e'er weds again he will have an old maid  How happy is he for old spinsters are plenty  Tho' I'm not of that list for I never saw twenty  Derry down c  With me his acquaintance may sing and rejoice  That he makes so judicious so decent a choice  'Tis so natural too for we frequently see  That Ivey will cling to an old wither'd tree  Derry down c  Of all sorts of wit he's most fond of a ballad  So asses eat thistlesinstead of a sallad  Tho' he thinks that my innocent pen cannot hurt  He may thank me for making my ballad so short  Derry down c  Tho' short as it is he will think it too long  Should it chance for awhile to silence his tongue  To be silent he hates as the De'el holy water  For all his delight is in chat and in laughter  Derry down c  A ballad he ask'd and a ballad here is  But if he should chance to take something amiss  He must ev'n thank himself for insisting upon it  So here ends my ballad or for rhyme's sake my sonnet  Derry down c  THE TWO SNEERERS  BY WH  ' YOur servant sir' says surly Quin  ' Sir I am your's' replies Macklin  ' You are the very Jew you play  ' Your phiz performs the task well'  ' And you are Brute himself they say  ' And most accomplish'd Maskwell'  Says Rich who heard the sneering elves  And knew their horrid hearts  " Acting too much your very selves  " Ye overdo your parts"  ORIENTAL ECLOGUES  BY MR WILLIAM COLLINS  ECLOGUE I SELIM OR THE SHEPHERD'S MORAL  SCENE A VALLEY NEAR BAGDAT TIME THE MORNING  YE Persian maids attend your poet's lays  And hear how shepherds pass their golden days  Not all are blest whom fortune's hand sustains  With wealth in courts nor all that haunt the plains  Well may your hearts believe the truths I tell  'Tis virtue makes the bliss where'er we dwell  Thus Selim sung by sacred Truth inspir'd  Nor praise but such as Truth bestow'd desir'd  Wise in himself his meaning songs convey'd  Informing morals to the shepherd maid  Or taught the swains that surest bliss to find  What groves nor streams bestow a virtuous mind  When sweet and blushing like a virgin bride  The radiant morn resum'd her orient pride  When wanton gales along the valleys play  Breathe on each flower and bear their sweets away  By Tigris' wandering waves he sat and sung  This useful lesson for the fair and young  Ye Persian dames he said to you belong  Well may they please the morals of my song  No fairer maids I trust than you are found  Grac'd with soft arts the peopled world around  The morn that lights you to your loves supplies  Each gentler ray delicious to your eyes  For you those flowers her fragrant hands bestow  And yours the love that kings delight to know  Yet think not these all beauteous as they are  The best kind blessings heaven can grant the fair  Who trust alone in beauty's feeble ray  Boast but the worth  The gulph of that name famous for the pearlfishery  Balsora's pearls display  Drawn from the deep we own their surface bright  But dark within they drink no lustrous light  Such are the maids and such the charms they boast  By sense unaided or to virtue lost  Selfflattering sex your hearts believe in vain  That love shall blind when once he fires the swain  Or hope a lover by your faults to win  As spots on errain beautify the skin  Who seeks secure to rule be first her care  Each softer virtue that adorns the fair  Each tender passion man delights to find  The lov'd perfections of a female mind  Blest were the days when Wisdom held her reign  And shepherds sought her on the silent plain  With Truth she wedded in the secret grove  Immortal Truth and daughters bless'd their love  O haste fair maids ye Virtues come away  Sweet Peace and Plenty lead you on your way  The balmy shrub for you shall love our shore  By Ind excell'd or Araby no more  Lost to our fields for so the fates ordain  The dear deserters shall return again  Come thou whose thoughts as limpid springs are clear  To lead the train sweet Modesty appear  Here make thy court amidst our rural scene  And shepherdgirls shall own thee for their queen  With thee be Chastity of all afraid  Distrusting all a wise suspicious maid  But man the mostnot more the mountain doe  Holds the swift falcon for her deadly foe  Cold is her breast like flowers that drink the dew  A silken veil conceals her from the view  No wild desires amidst thy train be known  But Faith whose heart is fix'd on one alone  Desponding Meekness with her downcast eyes  And friendly Pity full of tender sighs  And Love the last by these your hearts approve  These are the virtues that must lead to love  Thus sung the swain and antient legends say  The maids of Bagdat verified the lay  Dear to the plains the Virtues came along  The shepherds lov'd and Selim bless'd his song  ECLOGUE II HASSAN OR THE CAMELDRIVER  SCENE THE DESERT TIME MIDDAY  IN silent horror o'er the boundless waste  The driver Hassan with his camels past  One cruise of water on his back he bore  And his light scrip contain'd a scanty store  A fan of painted feathers in his hand  To guard his shaded face from scorching sand  The sultry sun had gain'd the middle sky  And not a tree and not an herb was nigh  The beasts with pain their dusty way pursue  Shrill roar'd the winds and dreary was the view  With desperate sorrow wild th' affrighted man  Thrice sigh'd thrice struck his breast and thus began  " Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  " When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  Ah little thought I of the blasting wind  The thirst or pinching hunger that I find  Bethink thee Hassan where shall Thirst asswage  When fails this cruise his unrelenting rage  Soon shall this scrip its precious load resign  Then what but tears and hunger shall be thine  Ye mute companions of my toils that bear  In all my griefs a more than equal share  Here where no springs in murmurs break away  Or mosscrown'd fountains mitigate the day  In vain ye hope the green delights to know  Which plains more blest or verdant vales bestow  Here rocks alone and tasteless sands are found  And faint and sickly winds for ever howl around  " Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  " When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  Curst be the gold and silver which persuade  Weak men to follow farfatiguing trade  The lillypeace outshines the silver store  And life is dearer than the golden ore  Yet money tempts us o'er the desert brown  To every distant mart and wealthy town  Full oft we tempt the land and oft the sea  And are we only yet repay'd by thee  Ah why was ruin so attractive made  Or why fond man so easily betray'd  Why heed we not while mad we haste along  The gentle voice of peace or pleasure's song  Or wherefore think the flowery mountain's side  The fountain's murmurs and the valley's pride  Why think we these less pleasing to behold  Than dreary deserts if they lead to gold  " Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  " When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way"  O cease my fearsall frantic as I go  When thought creates unnumber'd scenes of woe  What if the lion in his rage I meet  Oft in the dust I view his printed feet  And fearful oft when day's declining light  Yields her pale empire to the mourner night  By hunger rous'd he scours the groaning plain  Gaunt wolves and sullen tygers in his train  Before them death with shrieks directs their way  Fills the wild yell and leads them to their prey  " Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  " When first from Shiraz' walls I bent my way"  At that dead hour the silent asp shall creep  If ought of rest I find upon my sleep  Or some swoln serpent twist his scales around  And wake to anguish with a burning wound  Thrice happy they the wise contented poor  From lust of wealth and dread of death secure  They tempt no deserts and no griefs they find  Peace rules the day where reason rules the mind  " Sad was the hour and luckless was the day  " When first from Shiraz' walls I bent my way"  O hapless youth for she thy love hath won  The tender Zara will be most undone  Big swell'd my heart and own'd the powerful maid  When fast she dropt her tears as thus she said  " Farewell the youth whom sighs could not detain  " Whom Zara's breaking heart implor'd in vain  " Yet as thou go'st may every blast arise  " Weak and unfelt as these rejected sighs  " Safe o'er the wild no perils may'st thou see  " No griefs endure nor weep false youth like me"  O let me safely to the fair return  Say with a kiss she must not shall not mourn  O let me teach my heart to lose its fears  Recall'd by Wisdom's voice and Zara's tears  He said and call'd on heaven to bless the day  When back to Schiraz' walls he bent his way  ECLOGUE III ABRA OR THE GEORGIAN SULTANA  SCENE A FOREST TIME THE EVENING  IN Georgia's land where Tefflis' towers are seen  In distant view along the level green  While evening dews enrich the glittering glade  And the tall forests cast a longer shade  What time 'tis sweet o'er fields of rice to stray  Or scent the breathing maize at setting day  Amidst the maids of Zagen's peaceful grove  Emyra sung the pleasing cares of love  Of Abra first began the tender strain  Who led her youth with flocks upon the plain  At morn she came those willing flocks to lead  Where lillies rear them in the watery mead  From early dawn the livelong hours she told  'Till late at silent eve she penn'd the fold  Deep in the grove beneath the secret shade  A various wreath of odorous flowers she made  That these flowers are found in very great abundance in some of the provinces of Persia see the modern history of the ingenious Mr Salmon  Gaymotley'd pinks and sweet jonquils she chose  The violet blue that on the mossbank grows  Allsweet to sense the flaunting rose was there  The finish'd chaplet welladorn'd her hair  Great Abbas chanc'd that fated morn to stray  By love conducted from the chace away  Among the vocal vales he heard her song  And sought the vales and echoing groves among  At length he found and wooed the rural maid  She knew the monarch and with fear obey'd  " Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  " And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  The royal lover bore her from the plain  Yet still her crook and bleating flock remain  Oft as she went she backward turn'd her view  And bad that crook and bleating flock adieu  Fair happy maid to other scenes remove  To richer scenes of golden power and love  Go leave the simple pipe and shepherd's strain  With love delight thee and with Abbas reign  " Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  " And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  Yet midst the blaze of courts she fix'd her love  On the cool fountain or the shady grove  Still with the shepherd's innocence her mind  To the sweet vale and flowery mead inclin'd  And oft as spring renew'd the plains with flowers  Breath'd his soft gales and led the fragrant hours  With sure return she sought the sylvan scene  The breezy mountains and the forests green  Her maids around her mov'd a duteous band  Each bore a crook allrural in her hand  Some simple lay of flocks and herds they sung  With joy the mountain and the forest rung  " Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  " And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  And oft the royal lover left the care  And thorns of state attendant on the fair  Oft to the shades and lowroof'd cots retir'd  Or sought the vale where first his heart was fir'd  A russet mantle like a swain he wore  And thought of crowns and busy courts no more  " Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  " And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  Blest was the life that royal Abbas led  Sweet was his love and innocent his bed  What if in wealth the noble maid excel  The simple shepherd girl can love as well  Let those who rule on Persia's jewell'd throne  Be fam'd for love and gentlest love alone  Or wreathe like Abbas full of fair renown  The lover's myrtle with the warrior's crown  O happy days the maids around her say  O haste profuse of blessings haste away  " Be every youth like royal Abbas mov'd  " And every Georgian maid like Abra lov'd"  ECLOGUE IV AGIB AND SECANDER OR THE FUGITIVES  SCENE A MOUNTAIN IN CIRCASSIA TIME MIDNIGHT  IN fair Circassia where to love inclin'd  Each swain was blest for every maid was kind  At that still hour when awful midnight reigns  And none but wretches haunt the twilight plains  What time the moon had hung her lamp on high  And past in radiance thro' the cloudless sky  Sad o'er the dews two brother shepherds fled  Where wildering fear and desperate sorrow led  Fast as they prest their flight behind them lay  Wide ravag'd plains and vallies stole away  Along the mountain's bending sides they ran  'Till faint and weak Secander thus began  SECANDER  O stay thee Agib for my feet deny  No longer friendly to my life to fly  Friend of my heart O turn thee and survey  Trace our sad flight thro' all its length of way  And first review that longextended plain  And yon wide groves already past with pain  Yon ragged cliff whose dangerous path we tried  And last this lofty mountain's weary side  AGIB  Weak as thou art yet hapless must thou know  The toils of flight or some severer woe  Still as I haste the Tartar shouts behind  And shrieks and sorrows load the saddening wind  In rage of heart with ruin in his hand  He blasts our harvests and deforms our land  Yon citron grove whence first in fear we came  Droops its fair honours to the conquering flame  Far fly the swains like us in deep despair  And leave to ruffian bands their fleecy care  SECANDER  Unhappy land whose blessings tempt the sword  In vain unheard thou call'st thy Persian lord  In vain thou court'st him helpless to thine aid  To shield the shepherd and protect the maid  Far off in thoughtless indolence resign'd  Soft dreams of love and pleasure soothe his mind  'Midst fair sultanas lost in idle joy  No wars alarm him and no fears annoy  AGIB  Yet these green hills in summer's sultry heat  Have lent the monarch oft a cool retreat  Sweet to the sight is Zabran's flowery plain  And once by maids and shepherds lov'd in vain  No more the virgins shall delight to rove  By Sargis' banks or Irwan's shady grove  On Tarkie's mountain catch the cooling gale  Or breathe the sweets of Aly's flowery vale  Fair scenes but ah no more with peace possest  With ease alluring and with plenty blest  No more the shepherds whitening tents appear  Nor the kind products of a bounteous year  No more the date with snowy blossoms crown'd  But ruin spreads her baleful fires around  SECANDER  In vain Circassia boasts her spicy groves  For ever fam'd for pure and happy loves  In vain she boasts her fairest of the fair  Their eye's blue languish and their golden hair  Those eyes in tears their fruitless grief must send  Those hairs the Tartar's cruel hand shall rend  AGIB  Ye Georgian swains that piteous learn from far  Circassia's ruin and the waste of war  Some weightier arms than crooks and staffs prepare  To shield your harvests and defend your fair  The Turk and Tartar like designs pursue  Fix'd to destroy and stedfast to undo  Wild as his land in native deserts bred  By lust incited or by malice led  The villain Arab as he prowls for prey  Oft marks with blood and wasting flames the way  Yet none so cruel as the Tartar foe  To death inur'd and nurst in scenes of woe  He said when loud along the vale was heard  A shriller shriek and nearer fires appear'd  Th' affrighted shepherds thro' the dews of night  Wide o'er the moonlight hills renew'd their flight  TWELVE ODES  BY THE SAME  ODE TO PITY  O Thou the friend of man assign'd  With balmy hands his wounds to bind  And charm his frantic woe  When first Distress with dagger keen  Broke forth to waste his destin'd scene  His wild unsated foe  By Pella's  Euripides  Bard a magic name  By all the griefs his thought could frame  Receive my humble rite  Long Pity let the nations view  Thy skyworn robes of tenderest blue  And eyes of dewy light  But wherefore need I wander wide  To old Ilissus' distant fide  Deserted stream and mute  Wild Arun  A river in Sussex  too has heard thy strains  And Echo 'midst my native plains  Been sooth'd by Pity's lute  There first the wren thy myrtles shed  On gentlest Otway's infant head  To him thy cell was shown  And while he sung the female heart  With youth's soft notes unspoil'd by art  Thy turtles mix'd their own  Come Pity come by fancy's aid  Even now my thoughts relenting maid  Thy temple's pride design  Its southern site its truth compleat  Shall raise a wild enthusiast heat  In all who view the shrine  There Picture's toils shall well relate  How chance or hard involving fate  O'er mortal bliss prevail  The buskin'd Muse shall near her stand  And sighing prompt her tender hand  With each disastrous tale  There let me oft retir'd by day  In dreams of passion melt away  Allow'd with thee to dwell  There waste the mournful lamp of night  Till Virgin thou again delight  To hear a British shell  ODE TO FEAR  THou to whom the world unknown  With all its shadowy shapes is shown  Who seest appall'd th' unreal scene  While Fancy lifts the veil between  Ah Fear ah frantic Fear  I see I see thee near  I know thy hurried step thy haggard eye  Like thee I start like thee disorder'd fly  For lo what monsters in thy train appear  Danger whose limbs of giant mold  What mortal eye can fix'd behold  Who stalks his round an hideous form  Howling amidst the midnight storm  Or throws him on the ridgy steep  Of some loose hanging rock to sleep  And with him thousand phantoms join'd  Who prompt to deeds accurs'd the mind  And those the fiends who near allied  O'er Nature's wounds and wrecks preside  While Vengeance in the lurid air  Lifts her red arm expos'd and bare  On whom that ravening Brood of fate  Who lap the blood of Sorrow wait  Who Fear this ghastly train can see  And look not madly wild like thee  EPODE  In earliest Greece to thee with partial choice  The grieffull Muse addrest her infant tongue  The maids and matrons on her awful voice  Silent and pale in wild amazement hung  Yet he the Bard  Aeschylus  who first invok'd thy name  Disdain'd in Marathon its power to feel  For not alone he nurs'd the poet's flame  But reach'd from Virtue's hand the patriot's steel  But who is he whom later garlands grace  Who left awhile o'er Hybla's dews to rove  With trembling eyes thy dreary steps to trace  Where thou and Furies shar'd the baleful grove  Wrapt in thy cloudy veil th' incestuous Queen  Jocasta  Sigh'd the sad call her son and husband hear'd  When once alone it broke the silent scene  And he the wretch of Thebes no more appear'd  O Fear I know thee by my throbbing heart  Thy withering power inspir'd each mournful line  Tho' gentle Pity claim her mingled part  Yet all the thunders of the scene are thine  ANTISTROPHE  Thou who such weary lengths hast past  Where wilt thou rest mad Nymph at last  Say wilt thou shroud in haunted cell  Where gloomy Rape and Murder dwell  Or in some hollow'd seat  'Gainst which the big waves beat  Hear drowning seamens cries in tempests brought  Dark power with shuddering meek submitted thought  Be mine to read the visions old  Which thy awakening bards have told  And lest thou meet my blasted view  Hold each strange tale devoutly true  Ne'er be I found by thee o'eraw'd  In that thricehallow'd eve abroad  When ghosts as cottagemaids believe  Their pebbled beds permitted leave  And Goblins haunt from fire or fen  Or mine or flood the walks of men  O thou whose spirit most possest  The sacred seat of Skakespear's breast  By all that from thy prophet broke  In thy divine emotions spoke  Hither again thy fury deal  Teach me but once like him to feel  His cypress wreath my meed decree  And I O Fear will dwell with thee  ODE TO SIMPLICITY  O Thou by Nature taught  To breathe her genuine thought  In numbers warmly pure and sweetly strong  Who first on mountains wild  In Fancy loveliest child  Thy babe or Pleasure's nurs'd the powers of song  Thou who with hermit heart  Disdain'st the wealth of art  And gauds and pageant weeds and trailing pall  But com'st a decent maid  In Attic robe array'd  O chaste unboastful nymph to thee I call  By all the honey'd store  On Hybla's thy my shore  By all her blooms and mingled murmurs dear  By her whose lovelorn woe  In evening musings slow  Sooth'd sweetly sad Electra's poet's ear  By old Cephisus deep  Who spread his wavy sweep  In warbled wanderings round thy green retreat  On whose enamel'd side  When holy Freedom died  No equal haunt allur'd thy future feet  O sister meek of truth  To my admiring youth  Thy sober aid and native charms infuse  The flowers that sweetest breathe  Tho' beauty cull'd the wreath  Still ask thy hand to range their order'd hues  While Rome could none esteem  But virtue's patriot theme  You lov'd her hills and led her laureate band  But staid to sing alone  To one distinguish'd throne  And turn'd thy face and fled her alter'd land  No more in hall or bower  The passions own thy power  Love only love her forceless numbers mean  For thou hast left her shrine  Nor olive more nor vine  Shall gain thy feet to bless the servile scene  Tho' taste tho' genius bless  To some divine excess  Faint's the cold work till thou inspire the whole  What each what all supply  May court may charm our eye  Thou only thou can'st raise the meeting soul  Of these let others ask  To aid some mighty task  I only seek to find thy temperate vale  Where oft my reed might sound  To maids and shepherds round  And all thy sons O Nature learn my tale  ODE ON THE POETICAL

touch'd that fatal zone to her denied  Young Fancy thus to me divinest name  To whom prepar'd and bath'd in heaven  The cest of amplest power is given  To few the godlike gift assigns  To gird their blest prophetic loins  And gaze her visions wild and feel unmix'd her flame  The band as fairy legends say  Was wove on that creating day  When he who call'd with thought to birth  Yon tented sky this laughing earth  And drest with springs and forests tall  And pour'd the main engirting all  Long by the lov'd Enthusiast wooed  Himself in some diviner mood  Retiring sate with her alone  And plac'd her on his saphire throne  The whiles the vaulted shrine around  Seraphic wires were heard to sound  Now sublimest triumph swelling  Now on love and mercy dwelling  And she from out the veiling cloud  Breath'd her magic notes aloud  And thou thou richhair'd youth of morn  And all thy subject life was born  The dangerous passions kept aloof  Far from the sainted growing woof  But near it sate ecstatic Wonder  Listening the deep applauding thunder  And Truth in sunny vest array'd  By whose the Tarsol's eyes were made  All the shadowy tribes of Mind  In braided dance their murmurs join'd  And all the bright uncounted Powers  Who feed on heaven's ambrosial flowers  Where is the Bard whose soul can now  Its high presuming hopes avow  Where he who thinks with rapture blind  This hallow'd work for him design'd  High on some cliff to heaven uppil'd  Of rude access of prospect wild  Where tangled round the jealous steep  Strange shades o'erbrow the vallies deep  And holy Genii guard the rock  Its glooms embrown its springs unlock  While on its rich ambitious head  An Eden like his own lies spread  I view that oak the fancied glades among  By which as Milton lay his evening ear  From many a cloud that drop'd ethereal dew  Nigh spher'd in heaven its native strains could hear  On which that antient trump he reach'd was hung  Thither oft his glory greeting  From Waller's myrtle shades retreating  With many a vow from Hope's aspiring tongue  My trembling feet his guiding steps pursue  In vainSuch bliss to one alone  Of all the sons of soul was known  And Heaven and Fancy

manhood wending  Sate sorrowing at the close of day  At whose fond side a boy attending  Lisp'd half his father's cares away  The father's eyes no object wrested  But on the smiling prattler hung  Till what his throbbing heart suggested  These accents trembled from his tongue  " My youth's first hope my manhood's treasure  My prattling innocent attend  Nor fear rebuke or sour displeasure  A

uncertain fountain  The peacedestroying streams that flow  Nor from Ambition's dangerous mountain  Look down upon the world below  The princely pine on hills exalted  Whose lofty branches cleave the

glories all were blasted  And not one former tint remain'd  Nor let vain Wit's deceitful glory  Lead you from Wisdom's path astray  What genius lives renown'd in story  To happiness who found the way  In yonder mead behold that vapour  Whose vivid beams illusive play  Far off it seems a friendly taper  To guide the traveller on his way  But should some hapless wretch pursuing  Tread where the treacherous meteors glow  He'd find too late his rashness rueing  That fatal quicksands lurk below  In life such bubbles nought admiring  Gilt with false light and fill'd with air  Do you from pageant crowds retiring  To Peace in Virtue's cot repair  There seek the never wasted treasure  Which mutual love and friendship give  Domestic comfort spotless pleasure  And bless'd and blessing you will

But strange that as yet  No Twickenham wit  Ever thought of a neighbouring mill  That the sea's foamy juice  Did Venus produce  Let poets insist on it still  I stoutly aver  That a fairer than her  Took her rise from the froth of the mill  But say O ye Nine  How a Nymph so divine  Could the lap of a Miller's wife fill  Say did not some God  Stray out of his road  And set up his staff in the mill  Jove roguish and loose  In the shape of a goose  Did Leda so lovingly bill  That Helen she hatch'd  Who never was match'd  But by the fair Lass of the Mill  In another disguise  Alem  na he plies  Like Amphitryon he frolics his fill  Then why might not Jove  As a cloak for his love  Take upon him the Man of the Mill  No to tell every grace  Of this freshwater lass  I must own far surpasses my skill  Even Pope could not do't  And from head to foot  Describe the fair Lass of the Mill  Once Homer inflam'd  An hundred tongues claim'd  Some arduous task to fulfill  Let me tell thee old Bard  This task were too hard  Tho' thou hadst all the clacks of the Mill  Ye youth all beware  She's bewitchingly fair  Her eyes most assuredly kill  And a bosom more sleek  Than the downy swan's neck  Has the beautiful Lass of the Mill  Under petticoat red  Tho' her feet be well hid  Yet peep they alternately will  Which plainly must shew  More charms in perdue  Has the beautiful Lass of the Mill  But fie Muse forbear  'Tis better by far  No more of those charms to reveal  So doing you might  New rivals excite  And carry more sacks to the Mill  With influence benign  Ah would she incline  With my stars but to favour my will  So it might be with her  'Twould be raptures I swear  And music to live in a Mill  Then fairone be kind  Nor with water or wind  Inconstant turn round like the wheel  Lest when I am dead  It might justly be said  That thy heart was the stone of the Mill  A SONG  UNjustly Cloe you suggest  That I inconstant have possest  Or lov'd a fairer she  Would you at once with ease be cur'd  Of all the ills you've long endur'd  Consult your glass and see  And if you think that I can find  A nymph more fair or one more kind  You've reason for your fears  But if impartial you will prove  To your own beauty and my love  How needless are your tears  If in my way I should by chance  Give or receive an amorous glance  I like but while I view  How slight's the glance how faint the kiss  To that much more substantial bliss  Which I receive from you  With wanton flight the curious bee  Thro' beds of violets ranges free  And where each floweret blows  Extracts the juice of all he meets  But for his quintessence of sweets  He settles on the rose  So I my passion to employ  In each variety of joy  From nymph to nymph may roam  Perhaps see fifty in a day  Those are but visits which I pay  But Cloe is my home  ELEGY  A SHEPHERDESS LAMENTS HER DROWNED LOVER  YE maids of the village attend  To the sorrowful tale I now speak  Oh refuse not your comfort to lend  For my heart is just ready to break  Ye knew my dear Celadon well  He was sprightly and handsome and young  On his lips what persuasion did dwell  How melodiously soft was his song  He was all my fond heart e'er desir'd  He was all that was generous and brave  What pity the charms I admir'd  From death had not power to save  But just as the day did approach  To give the dear youth to my arms  From the waters they brought me his corse  How faded were all his gay charms  As the lily when drooping with rain  Dejectedly hangs down its head  So languish'd his beautiful cheek  And all its vermilion was fled  His voice that as music was sweet  No more I enraptur'd shall hear  No more the fond swain shall repeat  A tale of soft love in my ear  Convey the dear youth to his grave  Lest his beautiful form I adore  Yet one silent kiss let me have  For alas I shall see him no more  Ye maidens attend on his bier  And strew all the pathway with flowers  And oh ye kind deities hear  May their loves be more happy than ours  As for me I will henceforth beware  How in love I engage my fond heart  For tho' love is a joy how severe  Is the pang from a lover to part  ZELIS AT TRIPOLI TO  Ibrahim is the late Tripoli ambassador and Zelis his wife  IBRAHIM IN LONDON  AN EPISTLE  She has heard of his infidelity to her which occasions a fit of illness in which she writes this  OH thou delight and sovereign of my soul  Haste to revisit thy lov'd native shore  Quick as the lightning flies from pole to pole  Fly thou to me ere yet I am no more  Those charms which thou wert wont so much to prize  Those charms alas are now for ever fled  Faded and gone the lustre of my eyes  And all the roses on my cheeks are dead  As the pale lily drench'd with morning dews  Hangs down dejectedly its drooping head  So my wan cheek to the beholder shews  Ne'er to resume its once delicious red  Black boding thoughts first robb'd me of my peace  And long in secret on my mind have prey'd  In vain is medicine tried to give me ease  In vain alas is the physician's aid  For babbling Fame has whisper'd in my ear  Since you your Zelis could no longer see  That to your bosom she no more is dear  And Ibrahim is false to love and me  That you're a rover like the birds of air  Or like the bee that sips each honied flower  You flutter round each gay fantastic fair  And fondly court her to the myrtle bower  Does the first object of my early love  To whom I gave my spotless virgin charms  Ungrateful to his faithful Zelis prove  And waste his substance in a Dancer's arms  Hark Honour warns thee from each vicious deed  Oh rouse each virtue sleeping in thy breast  Thy Zelis' bosom then no more shall bleed  No more shall be with jealous cares opprest  What wouldst thou think if traitor to thy bed  Thy Zelis should while thou art absent prove  By every amorous youth astray be led  And to whoever courts her yield her love  But she tho' sharp thorns rankle in her breast  Still to her mate like Philomel is true  Like that sweet bird at night can take no rest  But sings a plaintive song of love and you  No need have I of slaves to guard my door  Of Negro hags most hideous to the sight  Virtue can shield whoe'er she dwells with more  Than eunuchs watching round her bed each night  Oh think thou dear destroyer of my ease  Oh think how cruel those deep wounds must prove  How it must rob me of all joy and peace  To know that Ibrahim's faithless to his love  Haste to my arms before my eyes I close  To calm the torments I for thee endure  Haste for 'tis thou alone canst bring repose  The hand that gave the wound alone can cure  Oh then restore my peace before I die  Let me thy graceful manly person view  Oh let me hear thee say that "tho' thy eye  Was free thy heart to me was always true"  So will I clasp thee in my longing arms  So will I bless thee with my latest breath  So will I pleas'd resign my faded charms  To the relentless claycold hands of death  And sure these faded charms again shall bloom  And like to man's my soul to heaven shall fly  My body rise more glorious from the tomb  And live with Allah to eternity  Else why has heaven bestow'd a generous mind  Adorn'd with virtue constancy and love  If here on earth no due reward they find  They surely must be recompens'd above  Perhaps there walking in immortal groves  Like some celestial Houri I shall shine  Perhaps again we shall renew our loves  And my dear Ibrahim be for ever mine  No jealous fears shall then my peace destroy  No thoughts of parting shall disturb my rest  But love alone my every thought employ  For ever

notes of our song  Alas must the youth so soon go  Oh Ibrahim must thou depart  Oh stay and some pity bestow  And break not with sorrow each heart  So smiling and gay was his face  His neck so majestic and strong  The maidens all crouded to gaze  Wherever he passed along  His voice that as music was sweet  No more we enraptur'd shall hear  No more the dear youth shall repeat  A tale of soft love in each ear  No longer with us shall he walk  No more shall he press the soft hand  Nor in praise of our charms e'er shall talk  Such praise as no maid could withstand  No more at dear whist or quadrille  Shall we chase the dull evening away  No more shall each interval fill  With chitchat and innocent play  Ye zephyrs oh bear all our sighs  To blow him a prosperous gale  If deaf to our tears and our cries  The youth is resolv'd to set fail  But if he with anguish does go  Oblig'd by parental command  Adverse may the gale always blow  And bear him again to our land  If spite of the prayers of the fair  Winds bear him to Tripoli's shore  Our hearts shall his presence declare  When the eye shall behold him no more  HOPE A PASTORAL BALLAD  MY pipe sounds a cheerfuller note  My crook is new garnish'd with flowers  This day to sweet thoughts I devote  Where blossom the eglantine bowers  My sheep unattended may stray  Where clover impurples the plain  My dog unregarded may play  Till morning rise on him again  'Tis fit that they too should partake  Of the joy that enlivens my soul  At night I'll repair to the wake  And merrily quaff the full bowl  Just now as I walk'd thro' the grove  I met my dear Delia there  And told her a tale of my love  Which she seem'd with soft pleasure to hear  A blush like the blush of the dawn  Stole over her beautiful cheek  Smiles sweeter than infants newborn  Told more than I wish'd her to speak  I stole from her hand a sweet kiss  Nor tried she to draw it away  No description comes up to the bliss  That reigns in my bosom

pertest and swear in vain  They see my vows are much against the grain  They see the love that I would fain conceal  They see my face as white as any veal  Then to my arms and to my wishes fly  I'll

DERBY  RICHARD THE FARMER'S ANSWER  Love reigns a very tyrant in my breast  DEAR MARY  THis morn when at the inn I'd sold my hay  Give me says I the paper of today  But sure it struck me with a strange surprize  When Mary's letter met her Richard's eyes  For tho' thy lines to me are always dear  I wonder'd how the devil they came there  Much I admire th' expressions of thy love  Thy praise bestows a joy all joys above  Even that which yields such exquisite delight  When the ripe harvest meets my ravish'd sight  Yet dearest Mary it is I should say  " Your breath is sweeter than the newmown hay  " Your roguish eyes have stole my heart away"  Since from my fields your likenesses you take  Mine from your kitchen give me leave to make  Your eyes so soft so delicately round  Are like two plumbs I've in a pudding found  The jet black plumbs their heighten'd lustre owe  To the surrounding pudding's cheeks of snow  Should I behold the table richly stor'd  And a bak'd pudding crown the tottering board  Believe me Richard not a bit would taste  If Molly at the table was not plac'd  A pudding bak'd I ever did approve  But what's a pudding to a man in love  Love is a flameindeed 'tis very hot  How my blood boils like water in a pot  My inward pain my pale complexion speaks  Which once was browner than a bak'd ox cheek's  Cupud has pierc'd me with his sharpest dart  'Tis just

been said  By some Cardinal urg'd his fair Laura to wed  With an offer of fortune and welltim'd it was  For poets have seldom much rent from Parnass'  Cried my lord you'll excuse me but I have a reason  Why even this offer becomes out of season  I've a new book of sonnets just ripe for the press  Upon the same plan as the last you may guess  I have there all along made my Laura a goddess  And Venus to please me has lent her the boddice  While Hebe Minerva and twenty to boot  With gifts all celestial have trick'd me her out  Now marriage my lord the whole charm would destroy  And hurl her divinity quite from the sky  To my cost I should find her no more than a woman  And my sonnets alas would gain credit with no man  SONNET  AH why did heaven such angelcharms bestow  To make me gaze and sicken with desire  Why every virtue lavish on thee so  To fan a strong but ineffectual fire  To me alas inexorable fate  Denies that tribute I aspir'd to pay  Yet may I live untortur'd by thy hate  Since how I lov'd thou hast forbad me say  If e'er the captive of those angelcharms  A future swain his passion shall declare  Some happier omen guide him to thy arms  Crown'd be that passion by

fate  How few are with their spouse content  Or constant to their sighing mate  How seldom souls below are join'd  For one another form'd above  How seldom pairs of hearts we find  By heaven ordain'd for mutual love  Thus man's inconstant soul we blame  For want of knowledge or of thought  When all the while 'tis in the frame  Of both their bodies lies the fault  When Jove had made this little ball  For fourlegg'd beasts and creeping things  At length he form'd to govern all  A twolegg'd creature without wings  Millions of these he made at once  To save himself all further trouble  And men and women for the nonce  By pairs like tallies he made double  Then from Olympus dreadful top  Well shaken in a bag together  He toss'd them down and let them drop  Just as it pleas'd the wind or weather  Some fell in Asia some in Greece  In England some and some in Spain  But seldom two of the same piece  In the same climate met again  Hence men who grown to riper years  Remembring this their former making  Hunt up and down to find their peers  And women too in the same taking  Some prove too short and some too tall  This is too big and that too little  A fault they're sure to find in all  Few ever tally to a tittle  By chance a pair may meet and love  And spend their lives in bliss together  But when they tumbled from above  It must be mighty temperate weather  From hence the murmuring fair may see  Mens hearts are not to blame a bit  Our souls would never disagree  If once our bodies did but fit  A PASTORAL HYMN TAKEN FROM THE TWENTYTHIRD PSALM  SEcure o'er the meadow the valley

can I errwhen the Lord is my guide  By the hand of indulgence each day am I bless'd  And am lull'd every night on the pillow of rest  When hungry my shepherd his votary leads  To the banquet of nature that smiles on the meads  And commands when I'm thirsty my fever to cease  With pure living streams from the fountain of peace  Thus calmly I wander the journey of life  Unknowing of sorrows unruffled by strife  My shepherd still soothing with tender controul  Each rebel of passion that heaves in my soul  Still pointing indulgent the path to my sight  And how happy am Iwhen I know 'tis the right  Should I tread the lone valley the comfortless ground  Where Death spreads a midnight of darkness around  No danger of fearwhile I roam o'er the plain  Oh Death all thy horrors and frowns are in vain  Still still thro' the desert my shepherd attends  Of parents the fondest the dearest of friends  Ah vainly ye wicked ye point at my heart  For the hand of the Lord turns aside every dart  Ah vainly

Ever since I was born it is he that hath crown'd  The life that he gave me with blessings all round  While yet on the breast a poor infant I hung  E'er time had unloosen'd the strings of my tongue  He gave me the help which I could not then ask  Now therefore to thank him shall be my tongue's task  Thro' my tenderest years with as tender a care  My soul like a lamb in his bosom he bare  To the brook he would lead me whene'er I had need  And point out the pasture where best I might feed  No harm could approach me for he was my shield  From the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field  The wolf to devour me would oftentimes prowl  But the Lord was my shepherd and guarded my soul  How oft in my youth have I wander'd astray  And still he hath brought me back to the right way  When lost in dark error no path I could meet  His word like a lantern hath guided my feet  What wondrous escapes to his kindness I owe  When rash and unthinking I sought my own woe  My soul had long since been gone down the deep  If the Lord had not watched when I was asleep  Whensoe'er at a distance he sees me afraid  He skips o'er the mountain and comes to my aid  Then leads me back gently and bids me abide  In the midst of his flock and feed close by his side  How safe in his keeping how happy and free  Could I always remain where he bids me to be  Yea blest are the people and happy thrice told  That obey the Lord's voice and abide in his fold  The fold it is full and the pasture is green  All is friendship and love and no enmity seen  There the Lord dwells among us upon his own hill  With the flocks all around him awaiting his will  Himself in the midst with a provident eye  Regarding our wants and procuring supply  An abundance springs up of each nourishing bud  And we gather his gifts and are filled with good  At his voice or example we move or we stay  For the Lord is himself both our leader and way  The hills smoke with incense where'er he hath trod  And a sacred perfume shows the footsteps of God  While blest with his presence the valleys beneath  A sweet smelling savour incessantly breathe  The delight is renew'd of each sensible thing  And beheld in their bloom all the beauties of spring  Or if a quite different scene he prepare  And we march thro' the wilderness barren and bare  By his wonderful works we see plainly enough  That the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof  If we hunger or thirst and are ready to faint  A relief in due season prevents our complaint  The rain at his word brings us food from the sky  And rocks become rivers when we are adry  From the fruitfullest hill to the barrenest rock  The Lord hath made all for the sake of his flock  And the flock in return the Lord always confess  In plenty their joy and their hope in distress  He beholds in our welfare his glory display'd  And we find ourselves blest in obedience repay'd  With a cheerful regard we attend to his ways  Our attention is prayer and our cheerfulness praise  The Lord is my shepherd what then shall I fear  What danger can frighten me while he is near  Not when the time calls me to walk thro' the vale  Of the shadow of death shall my heart ever fail  Tho' afraid of myself to pursue the dark way  Thy rod and thy staff be my comfort and stay  For I know by thy guidance when once it is past  To a fountain of life it will bring me at last  The lord is become my salvation and song  His blessing shall follow me all my life long  Whatsoever condition he places me in  I am sure 'tis the best it could ever have been  For the Lord he is good and his mercies are sure  He only afflicts us in order to cure  The Lord will I praise while I have any breath  Be content all my life and resign'd at my death  ON FRIENDSHIP  Nomen inane vale  FRiendship adieu thou dear deceitful good  So much profess'd so little understood  How often to thy sacred injur'd name  A thousand vain pretenders lay their claim  Like flies attend the summer of our day  And in the sunbeams of our fortunes play  But when life's winterevening shades come on  Soon we behold the treacherous insects gone  And find ourselves at once deserted and undone  PROLOGUE TO THE DISTRESSED MOTHER ACTED IN THE COUNTRY TO RAISE MONEY IN ORDER TO DISCHARGE A DEBTOR FROM PRISON  BY PW  WIde o'er the world Misfortune bears her sway  Nor holds a feeble empire of a day  Bound by no limits or of place or time  In every age she reigns and every clime  Kings at her will must quit their antient throne  To roam in exile or in chains to groan  The widow'd princess and her captive boy  In foreign lands lament their native Troy  Think not she claims alone the regal feat  And none can be unhappy but the great  With fatal bow still bent and aim'd at all  She sees promiscuous victims round her fall  Plants in each heart the rankling shaft of woe  Bids from each eye the gush of sorrow flow  Yet fair Compassion heaveninstructed maid  For ever waits to lend her soothing aid  With lenient hand propitious balm bestows  Calms the vex'd mind and breathes divine repose  Such in your breasts now glow the generous fires  Which pity kindles or desert inspires  Warm with like zeal your efforts now agree  Not without law to set the prisoner free  Long time immur'd within yon dreary room  His days were sadden'd with perpetual gloom  Estrang'd to him howe'er the seasons ran  The face of nature as the face of man  By you restor'd forgot his former pain  He mingles in the cheerful world again  Poor as he is your bounty to repay  His prayers may thank you in the noblest way  To you the circle of the kind and good  Sincere he vows unceasing gratitude  His failings and his griefs alike unknown  Love freedom health and peace be all your own  Eternal blessings on your steps attend  Who prove this night the poor man's prisoner's friend  AN EVENING HYMN  BY SIR THOMAS BROWN AUTHOR OF RELIGIO MEDICI  THE night is come like to the day  Depart not thou great God away  Let not my sins black as the night  Eclipse the lustre of thy light  Keep still in my horizon for to me  The sun makes not the day but thee  Thou whose nature cannot sleep  On my temples centry keep  Guard me 'gainst those watchful foes  Whose eyes are open while mine close  Let no dreams my head infest  But such as Jacob's temples blest  While I do rest my soul advance  And make my sleep an holy trance  That I may my rest being wrought  Awake into some holy thought  And with as active vigour run  My course as doth the nimble sun  Sleep is a death O make me try  By sleeping what it is to die  And as gently lay my head  On my grave as now my hed  Howe'er I rest great God let me  Awake again at last with thee  And thus assur'd behold I lie  Securely or to wake or die  These are my drowsy days in vain  I now do wake to sleep again  O come that hour when I shall never  Sleep again but wake for ever  A THOUGHT AT WAKING  THat morning too will dawn when I shall rise  Fresh from the dust and soaring seek the skies  Then why should I lament that night draws on  And tir'd refuse to lay my burthen down  Tho' others more yet I enough have seen  And guess what is to be by what hath been  And since my youthful days now almost past  Have pleas'd so little welcome thou my last  'Tis the least care of all that fills this head  What men design when I have stole to bed  Closing my eyes the world I now enclose  And Fancy waking murthers my repose  But in the grave the house of rich and poor  Fast I shall sleep and dream of life no more  CONTENTS  NOvember An ode Page  November A pastoral elegy  On
