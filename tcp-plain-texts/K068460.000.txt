Mr HARTRY  TWITCH  Mrs BRADSHAW  RHEUM  Mrs DORMAN  THE Old Women Weatherwise  Enter  TWITCH  and  CRAMP  TWITCH  GOODmorrow neighbour how do you do  CRAMP  Goodmorrow goody Twitch to you  TWITCH  'Tis sorry weather neighbour Cramp  CRAMP  Ah very dirty very damp  TWITCH  By the gnawing in my shoulder  Before we are a fortnight older  I fear we worse and worse shall see  CRAMP  Ah that we shall for my poor knee  Twitches and throbs and gives me pain  Depend upon't it brings us rain  TWITCH  Nay I must differ from you there  I rather think it will be fair  For by the burning in my toe  And by this corn of mineohoh  Good lack aday it makes me sweat  Oh the burning and the heat  Besides my cat so whisk'd about  Up stairs and down made such a rout  And that's a sign I always find  That brings us either frost or wind  CRAMP  God send a change then very soon  And if we judge it by the Moon  The new one that appear'd last night  Lay on her back and shone so bright  That I assure you on my word  She looks as sharp as any sword  TWITCH  What says old SodoHe has learning  And has beside a quick discerning  He soon cou'd tell should he but look  Into his fortunetelling book  CRAMP  I saw him scarce three nights ago  But then he terrified me so  I could not rest all night in bed  His story ran so in my head  Sometimes he called the Moon a punk  And said that Neptune made her drunk  And that she tippled greedily  Upon the springtides of the sea  One night this great foreteller said  The Moon was getting into bed  And in her reelings had the lot  To break her chrystal chamber pot  That he attributes one great reason  Why we have had so wet a season  TWITCH  Nay I myself have seen her rise  With sanguine nose and bloodshot eyes  Sometimes indeed I've seen her shroud  Her head in shame behind a cloud  Say what's the reason  CRAMP  Why I think  As Sodo says the Moon must drink  TWITCH  If that indeed should be the case  I think she's wise to hide her face  CRAMP  Once I remember it was told  When I was scarcely nine years old  The earth had been all flooded o'er  For six and thirty days and more  'Twas the opinion of the wise  Who knew the motion of the skies  The Moon had turn'd her turvytopsy  And drank herself into a dropsy  The reasons given were most various  Some said the archer Sagittarius  As he one night was passing by  He let a bearded arrow fly  And to this day some folks will tell ye  He hit the Moon plump in the belly  Which tapping her for five weeks a'ter  She teemed upon the earth her water  Other gave out it was her grief  And that suits most with my belief  For now too plainly it appears  She means to drown us with her tears  TWITCH  But here comes neighbour Rheum I vow  Who wears a very thoughtful brow  I wonder where my lady's been  She shakes her head what can she mean  Enter  RHEUM  RHEUM  Goodies I'm glad to see ye  Health and happiness be wi'ye  TWITCH  What news What news  RHEUM  Sad news alas  If what I've heard should come to pass  CRAMP  What have you heard  RHEUM  Nay I've seen  A wonder where I lately been  For coming home at twelve last night  I saw a most alarming sight  No good to this world it portends  Nothat I can assure ye friends  TWITCH  Good lack you speak and look so bitter  It sets me in a horrid twitter  My toothless gums together chatter  I want yet fear to know the matter  RHEUM  Well wellI'll tell ye all about it  I'll tell ye truthye need not doubt it  Last night I saw a flaming comet  Good gracious heav'n keep us from it  TWITCH  A cometPray what says our friend  RHEUM  He says the world is near an end  And I believe his saying's right  Oh what a striking awful sight  For such a swinging tail it bore  I never saw the like before  Nay morehe saysbut that between us  'Twill singe the bum of madam Venus  And what is worsewe're all undone  'Twill tumble us into the sun  TWITCH  Have mercy on us all I say  And grant we ne'er may see that day  RHEUM  Methinks we hold this theme too long  What say ye goodies to a song  CRAMP  With all my heart and I'll begin  Tho' I can't sing now worth a pin  SONG  O lackaday O lackaday  What shall I do what shall I say  Come never think  But let us drink  'Till we have wash'd our sins away  Then let it snow  Or let it blow  Pulls a bottle out of her pocket  When we are lin'd with brandy O  For if we die  'Twixt you and I  We have a weary jaunt to go  They dance the hays and then all drink  RHEUM  When the horrors grow too strong  There's nothing kills 'em like a song  CRAMP  When song and dance will not prevail  And all your wise prescriptions fail  TWITCH  At such a time 'tis very handy  To have hard by a little brandy  SONG  TWITCH with the bottle in her hand  Wet the other eye  Wet the other eye  Let's be jolly  Melancholly  Is a folly  Then refrain  'Tis in vain  To complain  Let us wet the other eye  Drinks  CRAMP  Wou'd I had lived in David's days  Or when the pious poet says  The priest were wont their horns to blow  RHEUM  Ah we had been in heaven now  SONG  Psha psha what does it signify  Whether today or tomorrow it prove  Since we are all of us sure to die  Let us enjoy the passion we love  Come let's have a noggin my goodies a noggin  Come let's have a noggin to chear up the heart  Give me a good cordial for we must be jogging  Let's toss off a bumper before we depart  Exeunt singing  N B  At the conclusion of every song they amble the hays together to the tune they have sung  FINIS
