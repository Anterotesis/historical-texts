LONDON Printed for GEORGE KEARSLEY at Johnson's Head Fleetstreet MDCCLXXXV  TO  Richard Brinsley Sheridan  Esq  Whose DRAMATICK PERFORMANCES have been the chief Supports of the English Stage since the Death of Mr GARRICK  THIS COLLECTION OF THE  POETICAL WORKS  OF HIS CELEBRATED PREDECESSOR IS INSCRIBED  By his most obedient And most humble Servant GEORGE KEARSLEY  FLEET STREET  April    PREFACE  THE Publisher of the present Volumes has long observed with surprize the total neglect shewn to the Works of Mr GARRICK Though six years are now elapsed since his death no one step has been taken towards giving an edition of them Neither gratitude friendship affection nor interest have in the slightest manner interposed His pieces have been suffered to remain in the same state in which the Author left them a prey to time subject to every accident and as it should seem doomed in a few years to be buried in oblivion  The Author careless and indifferent about his smaller productions dispersed them in such a variety of publications  that had he been now living he would probably have found some difficulty in assembling them together or even without assistance to recollect them This difficulty is encreasing every day By the death of friends by the forgetfulness of contemporaries and by the loss of fugitive pieces a compleat collection of them already a task not easy to be accomplished will in a few years become impossible  It is a consideration which may not be thought very honourable to human nature that a man who contributed as much as any one of his time to the innocent amusement of life whose performances on the stage must be always remembered with delight by those who had the happiness of seeing them who had both the inclination and ability to confer favours who le  t behind him many living memorials of his friendship and generosity and whose death as has been truly  said  "eclipsed the gaiety of nations and impoverished the publick stock of innocent pleasure"  Dr Johnson's Life of Edmund Smith  should hitherto have found no person attentive to the calls of respect no one alive to the remonstrances of gratitude to erect a monument to his fame by collecting and publishing his fugitive performances  Abandoned and neglected as these have been both by their Author and his Representatives the Publisher has been prevailed upon to sollicit the assistance of many of Mr Garrick's friends and by their aid he has been enabled to present to the Publick a collection which has been long enquired after and which from the care with which it has been formed he trusts will not disgrace the memory of the Author Should the sources from whence the several pieces have been drawn be enumerated he is certain that he should be allowed some  merit from his industry as almost every performance has been selected from a different publication most of them very difficult to be procured and some from their scarcity equal in value to manuscripts  It would be impertinent to take up the Reader's time in recommending what has been so long and so universally approved Mr Garrick's writings do not want any such assistance Their merit has been already fully acknowledged and require only to be more diffused to be more applauded They are here classed in some measure according to their subjects and for the most part in chronological order By this means the Prologues and Epilogues which generally turn on the fashions or incidents of the day will serve to illustrate and keep in memory the foibles virtues vices and habits of the times and exhibit no unfaithful picture of the good sense or folly  which has prevailed heretofore compared with the present or any future period  To render the present edition as compleat as possible the Publisher has added a short Account of Mr Garrick's Life and Writings together with two Lists one of his Dramatick Works and the other of the characters he performed Both these he is informed are compiled with accuracy and will be allowed to have their use To them he has subjoined Mr Sheridan's elegant Monody a composition which is entitled to equal praise in the closet that it was honoured with on the Theatre To conclude he feels some satisfaction in reflecting that through his endeavours the Works and literary fame of Mr Garrick will be redeemed from that fate into which a few years more would have involved so excellent a writer and so valuable a man  A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF DAVID GARRICK Esq  A SHORT ACCOUNT c  DAVID GARRICK was born at Hereford about the month of February His grandfather was a merchant of French extraction as it is said who left his native country on the revocation of the edict of Nantz in the year This gentleman had two sons and two daughters one of the former became a winemerchant at Lisbon and the other whose name was Peter the father of the late Mr Garrick followed the military profession and had at the time of his death been advanced to a majority in the army He married a daughter of Mr Clough one of the Vicars in Litchfield Cathedral and happened to be quartered at the Angelinn in Hereford where his son David who was baptized  The following is an extract from the register book of the parish of All Saints in the City of Hereford  "David Garrick the son of Peter and Arabella Garrick was baptized the th of February "  It is remarkable that the late Mr Powell was also born in the city of Hereford  the  th of February was born Mr Garrick the father afterwards settled at Litchfield and resided there several years A short time before his death he determined to sell his commission and for that purpose entered into a treaty with a gentleman who had agreed to give him l for it but unfortunately before the sale was completed he died and left a numerous family in a great measure unprovided for  His son David received the first part of his education at the free school of Litchfield under Mr Hunter who had the honour of numbering amongst his scholars Doctor Johnson Chief Justice Willes Doctor Newton Bishop of Bristol and other men of eminence Very early in life our Roscius found a friend in Gilbert Walmsley  Esq  register of the ecclesiastical court there a gentleman then unmarried and well advanced in years whose partiality seemed to authorise some favourable expectations of a permanent provision all which were destroyed by Mr Walmsley's unexpectedly taking a wife He however recommended his young friend to Mr Colson master of the academy at Rochester in order to compleat his education and accordingly in the month of March Mr Garrick left  Litchfield in company with Doctor Samuel Johnson  A character of Mr Walmsley who died August aged is given by Doctor Johnson n his elegant life of Edmund Smith which accompanies "The works of the English Poets" The following epitaph was written on him by Mr Seward  READER if science honour reason charm  If social charities thy bosom warm  If smiling bounty ope thy heart and door  If justice stile theeguardian of the poor  Firm to Britannia's prince and church and laws  If freedom fire thee in thy country's cause  With sympathetic love these relicks see  But think not Walmsley deadhe lives in thee  But if regardless of strong reason's voice  In wine and noise and faction thou rejoice  If thou thy faith and liberties betray  And barter laws for arbitrary sway  If Briton born thy soul's a Gallick slave  Start from his tomb he wouldand call thee"Fool and knave"  Mr Walmsley translated into LatinDoctor Byrom's celebrated song beginning  "My time Oye muses"  c It is in the  Gentleman's Magazine  February  who at the same time quitted his profession of a schoolmaster and came to London where he afterwards became one of the first ornaments of literature  At the age of about eleven years Mr Garrick went over to Lisbon and was received by his uncle with great kindness but that strictness of morals which a fond relation wished to  see in his nephew not being observed at that place to prevent his being corrupted it was thought proper to send him back to England his uncle still preserving a great regard for him which he shewed at his death by leaving him a legacy of l  It appears from Mr  Walmsley's  letters that Mr Garrick was intended for the profession of the law and accordingly on the th day of March  Playhouse Dictionary  immediately on his arrival in London he was entered of the society of Lincoln'sInn but it is certain he never paid any attention to the study of that science and indeed it is within the memory of many yet living that his employment for a short time in the interval between his leaving school and his appearance on the stage was of a nature very different from what he was first destined to and what he afterwards pursued with so much reputation and success We are credibly informed that he followed the business of a winemerchant somewhere in or near Durhamyard being induced thereto it may be presumed by the encouragement and support of his uncle  To whatever cause it was owing we are not informed but his success in business was not sufficient to engage his continuance in it and  this want of success might perhaps arise from his attention to a more pleasing pursuit He had at school performed the part of Serjeant Kite with applause and he was now prompted to employ the talents which he possessed for his immediate support Chetwood mentions that his facetious good humour gained him entrance behind the scenes two or three years in Drurylane before he commenced actor and it is certain that he produced there his first drama called Lethe in April for Mr Giffard's Benefit Determining to try his fortune on the stage he went down to  Ipswich  under the name of Lyddel and performed in a strolling company there The part in which he first appeared was that of Aboan  From the information of a contemporary comedian  in Oroonoko and the approbation he met with in this country excursion encouraged him to pursue his plan in London He therefore after being as it is reported rejected by the manager of Covent Garden to whom he had offered his service engaged with Mr Giffard at the theatre in Goodman's Fields in the year The character he then attempted was that of Richard the Third and he performed it October th in a manner which fixed his reputation  on that basis upon which it stood as the first actor of the times during the rest of his life Two circumstances were observed on his first night's performance one that on his entrance on the stage he was under so much embarrassment that for some time he was unable to speak the other that having exerted himself with much vehemence in the first two acts he became so hoarse as to be almost incapable of finishing the character This difficulty was obviated by a person behind the scenes recommending him to take the juice of a Seville orange which he fortunately had in his pocket and which enabled him to go through the remainder of the character with that degree of excellence which he always afterwards shewed in the performance of it and which produced the applause which ever after uniformly attended him in it The person to whom he owed this seasonable relief was the late Mr Dryden Leach printer who used often to tell the story to his friends  It was during this first year of his theatrical life that he produced the farce of  The Lying Valet  a performance which has given pleasure to numberless spectators even after the principal character ceased to be performed by  its author At the end of the season he went over to  Ireland  and in that kingdom added both to his fortune and his fame The next year to he performed at Drury Lane and the year after to at the same theatre At the beginning of this season he was involved in a dispute with Mr Macklin who had joined with him in opposing the oppressions of the managers That gentleman complained that he was deserted in the agreement made with the managers and published a state of his case in a pamphlet intituled  "Mr Macklin's reply to Mr Garrick's answer To which are prefixed all the papers which have publickly appeared in regard to this important dispute"  The next year to he continued at Drury Lane but the succeeding season to he went again to Dublin and engaged with Mr  Sheridan  as joint sharer and adventurer in the theatre there In May he returned to London and performed in six plays at the end of that month at Covent Garden by which we are told he added l to a great sum acquired in Ireland  Victor's History of the Theatres vol I p  He performed but one year more as an hired actor to which was at Covent Garden theatre where he produced  Miss in her Teens  The mismanagement of the patentees of Drurylane Theatre after the deaths of Booth and Wilks and the retirement of Cibber from the stage had ruined every person concerned in it At this period the successors of Mr Fleetwood  Charles Fleetwood Esq The history of this gentleman is very remarkable It affords so striking a moral and at the same time so important a lesson that though not strictly connected with the life of Mr Garrick we hope to be pardoned for inserting the following particulars concerning him At the age of twentyone he came to a landed estate of six thousand pounds a year  "He was"  says Mr Victor History of the Theatres Vol I p  "agreeable in his person and the qualities of his mind and amiableness of his disposition carried with them irresistible attractions all the nobility of the kingdom seemed fond of cultivating an acquaintance with a young man of his extensive fortune right disposition and sweetness of temper He was affable and engaging in his address which was the last and only remaining quality that he kept with him to his death and no doubt that would have vanished with the rest if he had not found it of constant use to him in his business with the world as that address enabled him to deceive even persons that thought themselves armed against him"  He purchased the patent of Drurylane Theatre in the year and continued in the management of it until when he left the kingdom and some time after died a bankrupt both in fortune and reputation Mr Victor says he was a ruined man before he engaged in theatrical concerns and that for some years he profited by his purchase It was his misfortune early in life to be thwarted in a design which he entertained of uniting himself to a young lady of inferior fortune the disappointment of which threw him into that habit of dissipation which rendered him an easy prey to a set of sharpers who first deprived him of his fortune and afterwards of his integrity The present Duke of Norfolk in his  Thoughts Essays  and  Maxims  published in mo p relates the following fact which  "happened in the presence of his wife at either Bruges or Ghent before he was married or at all acquainted with her viz Mrs Fleetwood daughter to Lord Gerrard and mother to Mr Fleetwood who was master manager of Drurylane Playhouse a gentleman of a very ancient good family unhappily known came upon a visit and flung herself upon her knees to ask pardon of a Baronet's daughter who was then companion to Mrs Howard as the only atonement left in her power for having prevented her only son from marrying her to whom there could be no objection but that her fortune was not as great as another lady's she had in view for him by which means she was the occasion indirectly of the unhappiness of the young lady by unhinging her mind and souring her temper and of her only son's rum both in fortune and reputation by flinging him into a round of dissipation and pleasure in order to eradicate his strongest affections This kind of life had such an effect on him that he contracted that baneful habit of gaming so that in the course of a few years he ruined his fortune a very noble one as most gamesters do first by setting out a dupe and afterwards turning sharper at length he died unpitied and it is said of a broken heart being a little before reduced to a wretched annuity in some part of France"  He left several children Two of them appeared on the stage as actors and one is but lately dead This gentleman was two seasons and at Drurylane Theatre and received a considerable share of applause He however afterwards declined the pursuit and went to the East Indies where he acquired a genteel fortune The other son died at Edinburgh a few years since  became involved in so many difficulties  that it was no longer possible for them to  continue the conduct of a business to which they were strangers and which they were never likely to succeed in In that gentleman had left the Theatre to his creditors to manage after making the best terms he was able for himself They conducted the business of it for two seasons when unable to continue the management any longer the property of the patent house and scenes was offered to several persons but so apprehensive was every on  become of the hazard of intermeddling with the theatre that no purchaser was for some time to be found At this juncture the late Mr Lacy stepped forward and boldly ventured to engage for the purchase Having the reputation of a man of integrity he soon found friends among the monied men to support him in his undertaking the success of it he prudently concluded must depend in some measure on the abilities of the person with whom he should connect himself in the scheme Mr Garrick's reputation both as a man and an actor naturally led him to wish for his junction A treaty was soon begun and an agreement between them afterwards took place Application was made for a new patent which was obtained and both their names inserted in it  Victor's History of the Theatres Vol I p    The season which began in was the first of their management and was opened with an admirable Prologue written by Doctor Johnson and spoken by Mr Garrick  See Doctor Johnson's Poems published by Kearsley  From this time Drury Lane Theatre which had been so fatal to many adventurers became the source of wealth and independence to both partners who jointly exerted their several abilities in the management of the undertaking with a degree of harmony which did credit to their understandings and with a share of success which in some measure must be ascribed to that good correspondence which subsisted between them  Mr Lacey's memory as an honest and worthy man to whose assiduity and attention we are partly indebted for the present regularity of the Theatre deserves a few words He was originally a manufacturer at Norwich but unsuccessful in his connexions with trade He afterwards came on the stage and performed at the Haymarket in  Pasquin  and other pieces which were brought out at that theatre when under the direction of the late Henry Fielding esq He then read lectures in York Buildings and engaged in the scheme of building Ranelagh which the knavery of the person with whom he associated rendered unsuccessful The confidence which was reposed in his integrity enabled him without money to become the purchaser of Drury Lane Theatre at the juncture abovementioned and his prudence was the means of his amassing a considerable fortune which however would have been much larger had not an unhappy propensity to scheming taken possession of him and induced him to launch into undertakings by which he was a great loser We are informed his property was much lessened by searching for coalmines in Oxfordshire He was however still rich and at his death January left a very handsome estate to an only son whom he had by Mrs Willoughby an actress of Drury Lane Theatre This Gentleman has since sold his share in the theatre    After he had been a manager two years and the dissipation of youth had subsided the charms of a lady who then lived with the countess of Barlington as a companion made a conquest of him It is unnecessary to add that this lady is at present his widow She is we are informed by birth a German Her parents lived at Vienna and she appeared on the stage there as a dancer In the year she came to England and performed one Season at Drury Lane Theatre She was then called Madame Eva Maria Violetti The union between them took place on the d day of June and we may add that no marriage ever was attended with more happiness to both parties than this for near thirty years during which time it is on good authority asserted they scarce passed a day separate from each other  The theatrical season which commenced in the year was rendered remarkable by the  spirit of rivalship which prevailed at both houses At the beginning of Mr Garrick's management he had engaged Barry Macklin Pritchard Woffington Cibber and Clive and with these excellent performers it may be imagined the profits of the House were very considerable Soon after Mr Barry who was under articles refused to continue any longer at Drury Lane and when sued for the breach of his contract escaped from the penalty by means no way redounding to his honour Macklin and Mrs Cibber likewise went over to Covent Garden as did Mrs Woffington who is said to have entertained expectations of being united in marriage with Mr Garrick With these deserters aided by the veteran Quin Mr Rich opened Covent Garden Theatre Mr Garrick not intimidated by the strength of the opposition took the field on the th of September with an occasional Prologue spoken by himself  See p  which was answered by another delivered by Mr Barry and this again replied to by a very humourous Epilogue admirably repeated by Mrs Clive  See p  The play of Romeo and Juliet had lain dormant many years This was now revived at both Houses at Drury Lane with alterations  by Mr Garrick who performed the principal character Mr Woodward playing Mercutio and Mrs Bellamy Juliet against them at Coventgarden were Mr Barry and Mrs Cibber in the principal characters and Mr Macklin in Mercutio Both houses began on the first of October and continued to perform it for twelve successive nights when Coventgarden gave up the contention and its rival kept the field one night more with the credit of holding out longer than its opponent though it is supposed neither side reaped much advantage from the spirit of perseverance which had governed them both in this contest  In the year on the th day of March died Mr Pelham who had conducted the business of government for some years before with candour ability and integrity He was sincerely lamented both by prince and people and on this occasion Mr Garrick displayed his poetic talents in an ode which we are told ran through four editions in a few weeks It is a performance which does credit to him both as a man and a poet and is the first in the present volumes  The objectors to Mr Garrick's management of the theatre had a long time complained  that he had conducted himself with too strict an attention to oeconomy in the ornamental and decorative parts of theatrical exhibitions They were perpetually throwing out insinuations that the manager relying on his own powers was determined to regulate the entertainments of the stage with an eye only to his own advantage and without any regard to the satisfaction of the public These murmurs had continued some time when at last Mr Garrick determined to meet the wishes of his friends and to silence the discontents of his enemies For this purpose he applied to Mr Denoyer sen to recommend some person of genius to superintend and contrive a splendid spectacle to be exhibited at Drurylane The person fixed upon for the purpose was Mr Noverre a Swiss who immediately received orders to engage the best troop of dancers that could be procured These he selected from the foreign theatres and they consisted of Swiss Italians Germans and some French The entertainment in which they were employed was soon afterwards produced It was called The Chinese Festival and was in the theatrical phrase got up with great magnificence and at a very considerable expence The expectations  of the managers were however wholly disappointed in the success of the performance Although but few of the French nation were employed in it yet a report had been industriously spread that not only French dancers had been sent for over but French dresses also and even French carpenters and taylors The nation was then on the eve of a war and this afforded an opportunity for engaging the passions of those who professed themselves Antigallicans They accordingly formed associations to discourage the several performers and suppress the obnoxious performance whenever it should appear At length after having taken up more than eighteen months in preparing it was brought before the publick and received with all the virulence and opposition which might be expected from the violence and heat of the times The first performance of it was on the th day of November and was honoured with the presence of his late Majesty yet notwithstanding that circumstance it did not even then escape ill treatment On the second third fourth and fifth nights the riots continued with increasing strength though opposed each evening by several young men of fashion who  had determined to support the performance On the sixth evening the opposition acquired fresh vigour and increasing numbers They frustrated every attempt to proceed in the exhibition and committed every excess which a mob subject to no controul is apt to indulge itself in That evening was the last representation After receiving assurance that the piece should be acted no more the heroes who had signalized themselves in this important business proceeded to Mr Garrick's house in Southamptonstreet where they broke his windows and did other damages They then dispersed and the proprietors of the theatre were obliged to submit to the loss of more than four thousand pounds  It would be impossible to enumerate the several small pieces of poetry which Mr Garrick used to throw out from time to time as his leisure permitted to compliment his friends or to celebrate public events We shall however just mention here that in he wrote some verses on Mr Mason's taking orders  See p  and in he appears to have been one of the few who had taste enough to relish the beauties of Mr Gray's celebrated odes  Mason's Life of Gray p  In Dr Hill  wrote a pamphlet intituled "To David Garrick  Esq  the Petition of  I  in behalf of herself and her sisters" The purport of it was to charge Mr Garrick with mispronouncing some words including the letter I as  furm  for firm  vurtue  for virtue and others The pamphlet is now forgotten but the Epigram which Mr Garrick wrote on the occasion deserves to be preserved as one of the best in the English language  From this period no event of importance occurs in the annals of Mr Garrick's life until the year The business of the theatre went on without interruption and he continued to acquire both reputation and fortune In that year however he found himself obliged to exert his poetical talents in order to correct the impertinence of an insignificant individual a Mr Fitzpatrick who without provocation and in defiance of decency carried on a weekly attack against him in a paper called "The Craftsman" The original cause of the quarrel we are informed was grounded on some illiberal reflexions which Mr Fitzpatrick threw out against Mr Garrick and which the latter resented with spirit and propriety though a considerable time had elapsed before he was  provoked to take public notice of him As Mr Fitzpatrick's writings are now entirely forgotten the revenge which Mr Garrick took of him must from that circumstance alone be involved in some obscurity Those however who are unacquainted with either persons or facts will receive pleasure in reading Mr Garrick's admirable satire published on this occasion intituled THE FRIBBLERIAD a Poem which had the honour of being highly commended by Churchill who has also given a very severe correction to the same person  However unequal Mr Fitzpatrick was to the task of contending with Mr Garrick in a literary warfare yet the rancour which his defeat had engendered pointed out a new mode of attack to distress his antagonist It had been customary on the representation of a new performance to refuse admittance at any part of the evening unless the whole price of the entertainment was paid This had almost invariably been the rule and it had hitherto been submitted to as a reasonable demand from the managers to compensate for the extraordinary expence which new dresses and scenes occasioned To gratify his resentment Mr Fitzpatrick seized on this circumstance as a ground to disturb the peace of the theatre and to involve  the managers in a contest with the publick For this purpose handbills were dispersed about the coffee houses in the neighbourhood of Drurylane recommending a peremptory demand to be made and requiring an absolute promise to be given that no more than half the usual price should be taken on any evening of performance after the third act unless at the representation of a new pantomime A kind of association was entered into by several young men to obtain a redress of this grievance as it was called and Mr Fitzpatrick put himself at the head of it The evening on which the attack was made happened to be when the  The two Gentlemen of Verona  was performed for the alterer's Benefit The performance accordingly was interrupted after several attempts to proceed in it and the proprietors of the house thinking the requisition an unjust one and the manner of making it improper to be acceded to refused to submit to it in consequence whereof no play was acted that night and the audience received their money again at the doors having first amused themselves with doing all the mischief they were able By this trial the malecontents had discovered their strength and determined to carry their point  in humbling the pride of the manager On the next performance which was at the tragedy of  Elvira  they collected their whole force and again prevented the actors proceeding in the play It was in vain that Mr Garrick desired to be heard in defence of the ancient customs of the theatre The opposition insisted on a peremptory answer to their demand in the new regulation which after some time the proprietors of the house were obliged to agree to and once more peace was restored to the theatre after a considerable loss had been sustained and obliged to be submitted to  See an account of this riot  Gentleman's Magazine  vol XXIII p    This season was the last in which Mr Garrick could be said to have acted in the regular course of his profession From this time he declined performing any new characters and finding his health unsettled by the advice of his physician he determined to give himself some relaxation from care and fatigue He therefore made the arrangements necessary for carrying on the public entertainments during his absence and on the th of September the day on which the House opened he left London in order to make the tour of France and Italy To supply his place he engaged  the late Mr Powell who had received his instructions the preceding summer and whose success was equal to the abilities he possessed To the honour of his employers it may be added that his abilities were not higher than the encouragement he received for the exertion of them Although he was engaged for a term of years at a small salary yet he was before the season closed generously allowed an appointment equal to the first performer in the house We are credibly informed the prosits that year exceeded even those in which Mr Garrick performed in the height of his reputation  The interval from this period until the month of April Mr Garrick employed in travelling through the principal parts of Europe and was at every place where he resided and at most of the courts to which he was introduced received in the most honourable and cordial manner by the great as well as by men of letters each vying with the other in shewing respect to the greatest dramatic character of the age While he stayed at Paris he amused himself with reading  Fontaine's Fables  which pleased him so much that he was induced to attempt an imitation of  them He accordingly wrote one called  The Sick Monkey  which he transmitted over to a friend to be ready for publication immediately on his arrival It accordingly made its appearance in two or three days after with the following motto  "Thursday afternoon David Garrick  Esq  arrived at his house in Southamptonstreet Coventgarden Public Advertiser April "  And he had the pleasure of hearing the sentiments of his friends upon it many of whom mistook it for a satire upon him and accordingly expressed themselves in very warm terms on the occasion  Immediately on his arrival he resumed the management of the theatre and introduced some improvements which had been suggested by his observations on the conduct of the foreign stages From the list of his works it will be seen that he had not been idle while abroad He produced the next season several new pieces and in the beginning of the excellent comedy of  The Clandestine Marriage  written in concert with Mr Colman He also at the request of his Majesty appeared again upon the stage and on that occasiou spoke  See page  a new prologue replete with those strokes  of humour in which in that species of composition he manifested a superiority over all his contemporaries  In that year died Mr Quin  Mr Quin died the st day of January and Mrs Cibber on the th of the same month  and Mrs Cibber Their deaths were very pathetically taken notice of in the prologue to  The Clandestine Marriage  and for the former Mr Garrick wrote an epitaph which was placed over his tomb in the cathedral church of Bath Mr Quin was the only performer of any reputation when Mr Garrick first appeared on the stage and he had likewise been one of his earliest opposers For several years however before Mr Quin's death great cordiality had subsisted between him and Mr Garrick at whose house at Hampton he spent some time a few months before his death and there first discovered the symptoms of that disorder which carried him to his grave  The year was remarkable for the celebration of a jubilee at Stratford upon Avon the th th and th of September in honour of Shakespeare a ceremony which very much engaged the public attention Although it was treated by some as a subject worthy only  of ridicule yet by others it was deemed a just compliment due to the great writer whose memory was intended to be honoured by it The circumstance which gave rise to it happened some time before and was as follows A clergyman into whose possession the house once belonging to our great poet had come found that a mulberrytree which grew in the garden and which had been planted according to tradition by Shakespeare himself overshadowed his mansion and made it damp To remedy this inconvenience he caused it to be cut down to the great mortification of his neighbours who were so enraged at him that they soon rendered the place out of revenge too disagreeable for him to remain in it He therefore was obliged to quit it and the tree being purchased by a carpenter was retailed and cut out in various relicks of standdishes teachests tobaccostoppers and other things some of which were obtained by the corporation of Stratford The gentlemen belonging to this body soon after agreed to present Mr Garrick with the freedom of their borough and their steward communicated their intentions to him in a letter from whence the following extract is taken  "The corporation of  Stratford ever desirous of expressing their gratitude to all who do honour and justice to the memory of Shakespeare and highly sensible that no person in any age hath excelled you therein would think themselves much honour'd if you would become one of their body Tho' this borough doth not now send members to parliament perhaps the inhabitants may not be less virtuous and to render the freedom of this place the more acceptable to you the corporation propose to send it in a box made of that very mulberry tree planted by Shakespeare's own hand The story of that valuable relick is too long to be here inserted but the gentleman who is so obliging as to convey this to you will acquaint you therewith as also that the corporation would be happy in receiving from your hands some statue bust or picture of Shakespeare to be placed within their new townhall they would be equally pleased to have some picture of yourself that the memory of both may be perpetuated together in that place which gave him birth and where he still lives in the mind of every inhabitant"  The honour proposed in this letter to be conferred on Mr Garrick was accepted by him and the same compliment was paid to George  Keate  Esq  who had some time before produced a poem which contained an excellent eulogium on our admirable dramatick bard  " Yes jealous wits for empire still may strive  " Still keep the flames of critic rage alive  " Our Shakespeare yet shall all his rights maintain  " And crown the triumphs of Eliza's reign  " Above controul above each classic rule  " His tut'ress Nature and the world his school  " On pinions fancyplum'd to him was given  " The power to scale INVENTION'S BRIGHTEST HEAVEN  " Bid the charm'd soul to raptur'd heights aspire  " And wake in every breath congenial fire  " Revere his geniusto the dead be just  " Nor blast the laurels that o'ershade the dust  " Low sleeps the bard IN COLD OBSTRUCTION LAID  " Nor asks the chaplet from a rival's head  " Oe'r the drear vault ambition's utmost bound  " Unheard shall Fame her airy trumpet sound  " Yet while his AVON winds its silver way  " His wreaths shall bloom unconscious of decay  " As Raphael's own creation grac'd his hearse  " And sham'd the pomp of ostentatious verse  " So selfadorn'd shall Shakespeare stand array'd  " And Nature perish ere his pictures fade"  FERNEY to  In the month of May the persons deputed by the corporation waited on Mr Garrick and presented him with the freedom of their borough accompanied with the following letter  To DAVID GARRICK  Esq  SIR  The mayor aldermen and burgesses of the antient borough of Stratford upon Avon a town that glories in giving birth to the immortal Shakespeare whose memory you have so highly honoured and whose conceptions you have ever so happily expressedrejoice in an opportunity of adding their mite to that universal applause your inimitable powers have most justly merited and as a mark of their esteem and gratitude have respectfully transmitted to you the freedom of their borough in a box made from a mulberry tree undoubtedly planted by Shakespeare's own hand which they hope you will do them the honour of accepting  By order of the mayor aldermen and burgesses in common council  Signed by W HUNT Townclerk  Stratford upon Avon    May    The manner in which this entertainment was to have been performed the disappointments it sustained and the several occurrences  which took place at it are all so recent in the memories of most of our readers and were so accurately related at the time they happened  See Victor's History of the Theatres Vol III  that we shall not recapitulate them here It is sufficient to observe that accident deprived those who were present of part of their entertainment that all which was exhibited gave general satisfaction and Mr Garrick who was a great sum of money out of pocket by it framed an entertainment which was performed at Drurylane Theatre nights with great applause to very crouded audiences The ode which was spoken by him at Stratford was also repeated at the same theatre but not with much success being performed only seven times  This ode was parodied in an admirable burlesque called "An Ode on dedicating a Building and erecting a Statue to Le Stue Cook to the Duke of Newcastle at Clermont" Reprinted with Mr Garrick's Ode in Dilly's REPOSITORY vol I    The management of a theatre is always attended with anxiety and vexation the difficulty of satisfying the several candidates for theatrical fame is so great that he who can preserve the friendship of those whose pieces he rejects must be allowed to possess very extraordinary abilities In the year it was  Mr Garrick's misfortune to be embroiled with a very irascible and troublesome person who claimed the representation of one of his pieces at Drurylane and he inforced his demand in a manner that will stamp indelible disgrace on his memory He published a poem to intimidate the manager called  Love in the Suds  containing insinuations of the basest kind and which he afterwards denied having had any intentions to convey As this writer is dead those reflections on his conduct which had he been living might have appeared here and which the subject naturally suggests shall be suppressed It will be sufficient to observe that Mr Garrick had recourse to the court of King's Bench to punish the infamous libeller of his reputation and notwithstanding he had been a second time insulted by another publication conceived with equal malignity he was weak enough to stop the prosecution he had commenced on his adversary's signing an acknowledgment of his offence which was printed in all the public papers It cannot be denied but that the interests of society demanded that so gross an offender should meet with punishment and that no concessions ought to have been allowed to deprecate that stroke which the law would have inflicted on so heinous a crime  From this time no event of importance happened until the resolution which Mr Garrick had begun to form of quitting the stage was to the concern of every one carried into execution In the beginning of the year he entered into an agreement with some of the present patentees for the sale of his interest in the theatre but continued to act during the remainder of that season The last night of his performance was for the Theatrical Fund on the th day of June in that year when he represented the character of Don Felix in The Wonder At the conclusion of the play he came forward and addressed the audience in a short speech wherein he said  "it had been usual for persons in his situation to address the publick in an epilogue and that he had accordingly turned his thoughts that way but found it as impossible to write as it would be to speak a studied composition the jingle of rhyme and the language of fiction ill suiting his then feelings that the moment in which he then spoke was an awful one to him that he had received innumerable favours and took his leave on the spot where those favours were conferred"  He then said  "that whatever the events of his future life might be he should  ever remember those favours with the highest satisfaction and deepest gratitude and though he admitted the superior skill and abilities of his successors he defied them to exert themselves with more industry zeal and attention than he had done"  This speech which was delivered with all that emotion which the particular situation of the speaker rendered very interesting and affecting was received with the loudest bursts of applause and he left the stage with the acclamations of a numerous and polite audience who were unable to forbear expressing the deepest concern for the loss of their favourite performer  Mr Garrick now retired to the enjoyment of his friends the most respectable in the kingdom and of a large fortune acquired in the course of more than thirty years but the stone which he had been afflicted with some time had already made such inroads on his constitution that he was unable to communicate or receive from his friends that pleasure which his company afforded except at times and in a very partial manner It is supposed that he injured his health by the application of quack medicines and often experienced the most violent torments from the severity of his  disorder At Christmas he went to visit Lord Spencer at Althorp in Northamptonshire during the holidays He there was taken ill but recovered so far that he was removed to town where growing worse he died in a few days afterwards at his house in the Adelphi on the th day of January at the age of years leaving behind him the character of a friendly humane charitable and notwithstanding many idle reports we may add liberal man one who felt for distress and relieved it a chearful companion a pleasing writer and the first actor of this or any other age  A LIST of the CHARACTERS performed by Mr

still is cherish'd here  Can we persist to bid your sorrows flow  For fabled sufferers and delusive woe  Or with quaint smiles dismiss the plaintive strain  Point the quick jestindulge the comic vein  Ere yet to buried Roscius we assign  One kind regretone tributary line  His same requires we act a tenderer part  His memory claims the tear you gave his art  The general voice the meed of mournful verse  The splendid sorrows that adorn'd his hearse  The tnrong that mourn'd as their dead favourite pass'd  The grac'd respect that claim'd him to the last  While Shakespeare's image from its hallow'd base  Seem'd to prescribe the grave and point the place  Nor these nor all the sad regrets that flow  From fond fidelity's domestic woe  So much are Garrick's praiseso much his due  As on this spotone tear bestow'd by you  Amid the arts which seek ingenuous fame  Our toil attempts the most precarious claim  To him whose mimic pencil wins the prize  Obedient fame immortal wreaths supplies  Whate'er of wonder Reynolds now may raise  Raphael still boasts contemporary praise  Each dazzling light and gaudier bloom subdu'd  With undiminish'd awe his works are view'd  E'en beauty's portrait wears a softer prime  Touch'd by the tender hand of mellowing time  The patient sculptor owns an humbler part  A ruder toil and more mechanic art  Content with slow and timorous stroke to trace  The lingering line and mould the tardy grace  But once atchiev'd tho' barbarous wreck o'erthrow  The sacred fane and lay its glories low  Yet shall the sculptur'd ruin rise to day  Grac'd by defect and worship'd in decay  Th' enduring record bears the artist's name  Demands his honours and asserts his fame  Superior hopes the Poet's bosom fire  O proud distinction of the sacred lyre  Wide as th' inspiring Phoebus darts his ray  Diffusive splendor gilds his votary's lay  Whether the song heroic woes rehearse  With epic grandeur and the pomp of verse  Or fondly gay with unambitious guile  Attempt no prize but  avouring beauty's smile  Or bear dejected to the lonely grove  The soft despair of unprevailing love  Whate'er the theme thro' ev'ry age and clime  Congenial passions meet the according rhyme  The pride of glory pity's sigh sincere  Youth's earliest blush and beauty's virgin tear  Such is their meedtheir honours thus secure  Whose arts yield objects and whose works endure  The Actor only shrinks from time's award  Feeble tradition is his memory's guard  By whose faint breath his merits must abide  Unvouch'd by proof to substance unallied  Ev'n matchless Garrick's art to heav'n resign'd  No fix'd effect no model leaves behind  The grace of action the adapted mien  Faithful as Nature to the varied scene  Th' expressive glance whose subtle comment draws  Entranc'd attention and a mute applause  Gesture that marks with force and feeling fraught  A sense in silence and a will in thought  Harmonious speech whose pure and liquid tone  Gives verse a musick scarce consess'd its own  As light from gems assumes a brighter ray  And cloath'd with orient hues transcends the day  Passion's wild break and srown that awes the sense  And ev'ry charm of gentler eloquence  All perishablelike th' electric fire  But strike the frame and as they strike expire  Incense too pure a bodied flame to bear  Its fragrance charms the sense and blends with air  Where then while sunk in cold decay he lies  And pale eclipse for ever veils those eyes  Where is the blest memorial that ensures  Our Garrick's famewhose is the trust'tis yours  And O by ev'ry charm his art essay'd  To sooth your cares by ev'ry grief allay'd  By the husn'd wonder which his accents drew  By his last parting tear repaid by you  By all those thoughts which many a distant night  Shall mark his memory with a sad delight  Still in your heart's dear record bear his name  Cherish the keen regret that lifts his fame  To you it is bequeath'd assert the trust  And to his worth'tis all you canbe just  What more is due from sanctifying time  To chearful wit and many a favor'd rhyme  O'er his grac'd urn shall bloom a deathless wreath  Whose blossom'd sweets shall deck the mask beneath  For these when sculpture's votive toil shall rear  The due memorial of a loss so dear  O loveliest mourner gentle muse be thine  The pleasing woe to guard the laurel'd shrine  As Fancy oft by superstition led  To roam the mansions of the sainted dead  Has view'd by shadowy eve's unfaithful gloom  A weeping cherub on a martyr's tomb  So thou sweet Muse hang o'er his sculptur'd bier  With patient woe that loves the lingering tear  With thoughts that mourn nor yet desire relief  With meek regret and fond enduring grief  With looks that speakhe never shall return  Chilling thy tender bosom clasp his urn  And with soft sighs disperse th' irreverend dust  Which Time may strew upon his sacred bust  TABLE of CONTENTS  Ode on the Death of Mr Pelham  Page  The Fribbleriad    The Sick Monkey    Ode upon

PELHAM  Henry Pelham  Esq  brother to the Duke of Newcastle at the time of his death First Commissioner Chancellor and Under Treasurer of the Exchequer    An honest man's the noblest work of God  POPE  First printed  ODE ON THE DEATH OF Mr PELHAM  LET others hail the  rising  sun  I bow to that whose course is run  Which sets in endless night  Whose rays benignant bless'd this isle  Made peaceful nature round us smile  With calm but chearful light  No bounty past provokes my praise  No future prospects prompt my lays  From real grief they flow  I catch th' alarm from  Britain's  fears  My sorrows fall with  Britain's  tears  And join a nation's woe  Seeas you pass the crowded street  Despondence clouds each face you meet  All their lost friend deplore  You read in ev'ry pensive eye  You hear in ev'ry broken sigh  That PELHAM is no more  If thus each  Briton  be alarm'd  Whom but his distant influence warm'd  What grief their breasts must rend  Who in his private virtues bless'd  By nature's dearest tyes possess'd  The HUSBAND FATHER FRIEND  What mute ye bardsno mournful verse  No chaplets to adorn his hearse  To crown the good and just  Your flow'rs in warmer regions bloom  You seek no pensions from the tomb  No laurels from the dust  When pow'r departed with his breath  The sons of flatt'ry fled from death  Such insects swarm at  noon  Not for herself my muse is griev'd  She never ask'd nor e'er receiv'd  One ministerial boon  Hath some peculiar strange offence  Against us arm'd Omnipotence  To check the nation's pride  Behold th' appointed punishment  At length the vengeful bolt is sent  It fell when PELHAM dy'd  Uncheck'd by shame unaw'd by dread  When vice triumphant rears her head  Vengeance can sleep no more  The  evil  angel stalks at large  The  good  submits resigns his charge  And quits th' unhallow'd shore  The same sad morn  The th of  March  was remarkable for the publication of the Works of a  late Lord  and the death of Mr  Pelbam  to Church and State  So for our sins 'twas fix'd by fate  A double stroke was giv'n  Black as the whirlwinds of the north  St John's fell genius  issu'd forth  And PELHAM fled to heav'n  By angels watch'd in  Eden's  bow'rs  Our parents pass'd their peaceful hours  Nor guilt nor pain they knew  But on the day which usher'd in  The  hellborn train  of  mortal sin    The heav'nly guards withdrew  Look down  muchhonor'd Shade  below  Still let thy pity aid our woe  Stretch out thy healing hand  Resume those feelings which on earth  Proclaim'd thy patriot love and worth  And sav'd sinking land  Search with thy more than mortal eye  The breasts of all thy friends descry  What  there  has got possession  See if thy unsuspecting heart  In some for truth mistook not art  For principle profession  From these the pests of human kind  Whom royal bounty cannot bind  Protect our parent King  Unmask their treach'ry to his sight  Drag forth the vipers into light  And crush them ere they sting  If such his trust and honors share  Again exert thy guardian care  Each venom'd heart disclose  On  Him  on  Him  our all depends  Oh save him from his treach'rous friends  He cannot fear his foes  Whoe'er shall at the helm preside  Still let thy prudence be his guide  To stem the troubled wave  But chiefly whisper in his ear  " That GEORGE is open just sincere  " And dares to scorn a knave"  No selfish views t' oppress mankind  No mad ambition fir'd thy mind  To purchase fame with blood  Thy bosom glow'd with purer heat  Convinc'd that to be truly great  Is only to be  good  To hear no lawless passion's call  To serve thy King yet feel for all  Such was thy glorious plan  Wisdom with gen'rous love took part  Together work'd thy head and heart  The  Minister  and  Man  Unite ye kindred sons of worth  Strangle bold  faction  in its birth  Be  Britain's  weal your view  For this great end let all combine  Let virtue link each fair design  And PELHAM live in YOU  ADVERTISEMENT To the SECOND EDITION  The Author of the foregoing  ODE  has heard with pleasure that what he had written from his concern for the death of a good and great man has been favourably received He is not vain enough to think that the Poem has any merit but what results from the truth and mere feeling of the subjectmatterIn this edition he has altered some Stanzas which were too hastily published in the first and hopes he has now made it more worthy of his Readers  THE FRIBBLERIAD  Foemina Vir Neutrum  PUL in HERMOPH  First printed in the Year  ADVERTISEMENT  BE it known unto you gentle or ungentle reader that the author of the following poem is a volunteer in the service or rather a poetical knighterrant who according to the oath taken at the late installation is  exhortca and admonished  by Apollo to be sure  to use his sword in defence of all equity and justice to the utmost of his power  His brother Quixote of immortal memory tried his prowess upon Sheep and WindmillsOur champion does the very same and calls forth to the field an  unknown  knight who has the formidable X Y Z in his trainAnd that he may not be thought to engage with too great odds on his side he opposes to them his own  three trusty squires  A B C who are resolved to stand by him and fight all the weapons through from Epic Poetry to Epigram as long as there is a letter left standing in the English alphabetand now Mr Churchill may know that there is  A Quixote of the age will dare  To wage a war with dirt and fight with air  When the aforesaid  unknown  knight shall please to appear with his  beaver up  he may expect that our adventurer will shew  his face  tooIn the  mean time we will divert him in our turn with a little  bush  fighting which he has been endeavouring to entertain the town with for more than a twelvemonth past  It is therefore proper to inform thee reader for as yet perhaps thou hast not heard of it that there is a certain weekly paper called the Craftsman still existing if it may be called existence to crawl about from week to week and be kept alive by those last resources of hungry ingenuity falsehood and defamation In this said paper a certain gentleman who subscribes himself X Y Z a volunteer too in the service has thrown about his dirt in a most extraordinary manner and has attacked our Stage Hero with unwearied malevolence both in his public and private character but indeed his rancour being too much for his wit he has let his heart indulge itself at the expence of his head and has most imprudently made assertions in the bitterness of his spirit which can be contradicted by every attender upon the theatreIt would be endless and out of place here to point out his want of taste and even common truth in his account of the manner of Mr Garrick's speaking and acting in his various characters of his most ungentlemanlike as well as unjust abuse of his person voice age c c c for there is no kind of meanness as Montaigne well observes that a true malignant spirit will not descend toTo give one instance  among a thousand of his upright intentionsThis worthy gentleman Mr X Y Z not content with exposing his impotent malice weekly to the publick was at the pains and expence to collect his papers into one volume  The title of which was "An enquiry into the real merit of a certain popular Performer in a Series of Letters first published in the Craftsman or Gray's Inn Journal with an Introduction to David Garrick Esq" vo  and even send them to some of Mr Garrick's friends left the obscurity and disreputation of the paper in which they first made their appearance should have kept his malice totally a secretThe Reviewers gave their sentiments of this curious collection in the following manner  "These are the overflowings of spleen ignorance conceit and disappointment"  Crit Rev Jan    "The design of publishing these  important  pieces of criticism is to prevent the  sad misfortune  of their sinking into oblivion with a last year's newspaper If we believe the author all the praises that have hitherto been given to Mr Garrick as an actor are so entirely without foundation that  "he never did nornever could speak ten successive lines of Shakespeare with grammatical propriety"  This is an assertion so contrary to the opinion of many better critics than this author shews himself to be and in reality so opposite  to truth that it is alone sufficient to invalidate all his reasonings upon the subject"  Monthly Rev Dec    It would take up too much time at present to exhibit our hero X Y Z in all his proper colours we shall leave that task to a much abler hand who will very soon more fully detect and expose him and his designs  This was soon after executed in the following severe character drawn by Mr Churchill of the hero of this poem first inserted in the eighth edition of THE ROSCIAD  "With that low cunning which in fools supplies  And amply too the place of being wife  Which nature kind indulgent parent gave  To qualify the blockhead for a knave  With that smooth falsehood whose appearance charms  And reason of each wholesome doubt disarms  Which to the lowest depths of guile descends  By vilest means pursues the vilest ends  Wears friendship's mask for purposes of spite  Fawns in the day and butchers in the night  With that malignant envy which turns pale  And sickens even if a friend prevail  Which merit and success pursues with hate  And damns the worth it cannot imitate  With the cold caution of a coward's spleen  Which fears not guilt but always seeks a screen  Which keeps this maxim ever in her view  What's basely done should be done safely too  With that dull rooted callous impudence  Which dead to shame and every nicer sense  Ne'er blush'd unless in spreading vice's snares  She blunder'd on some virtue unawares  With all these blessings which we seldom find  Lavish'd by nature on one happy mind  A motley figure of the fribble tribe  Which heart can searce conceive or pen describe  Came simpering on to ascertain whose sex  Twelve sage impanell'd matrons would perplex  Nor male nor female neither and yet both  Of neuter gender though of Irish growth  A sixfoot sackling mincing in his gait  Affected peevish prim and delicate  Fearful  it  seem'd though of athletic make  Lest brutal breezes should too roughly shake  Its  tender form and savage motion spread  O'er its pale cheeks the horrid manly red  Much did  it  talk in  its  own pretty phrase  Of genius and of time of players and plays  Much too of writings which  itself  had wrote  Of special merit though of little note  For fate in a strange humour had decreed  That what  it  wrote none but  itself  should read  Much too it chatter'd of dramatic laws  Misjudging critics and misplac'd applause  Then with a selfcomplacent jutting air  It  smil'd  it  smirk'd  it  wriggled to the chair  And with an aukward briskness not his own  Looking around and perking on the throne  Triumphant seem'd when that strange savage dame  Known but to few or only known by name  Plain Common Sense appear'd by Nature there  Appointed with plain Truth to guard the chair  The Pageant saw and blasted with her frown  To  its  first state of nothing melted down  Nor shall the Muse for even there the pride  Of this vain nothing shall be mortified  Nor shall the Muse should fate ordain her rhimes  Fond pleasing thought to live in aftertimes  With such a trifler's name her pages blot  Known be the character the thing forgot  Let  it  to disappoint each future aim  Live without sex and die without a name"  But to return to our poem  It may properly be called an  Iliad  in a  nutshell  for though it does not consist of many  more than four hundred lines it contains all the essential epic propertiesthe plan sentiments  character diction moral metre and even the heroes themselves all in miniature  The following epigram printed in the Ledger was the cornerstone of the whole and furnished us with ideas of the redoubted Fitzgig the Achilles of the Fribbleriad  To X Y Z  Inded most severely poor Garrick you handle  Not bigots damn more with their bell book and candle  Though you with the town about him disagree  He joins with the town in their judgment of thee  So dainty so devilish is all that you scribble  Not a soul but can see 'tis the spite of a Fribble  And all will expect you when forth you shall come  With a  round smirking face  and  a jut with your bum  If X Y Z is really such a thing as here represented he is most welcome to the honour we have done him if he is  not  he may thank his own malignant d sposition that made it natural to suppose that such poor spite could proceed from no one who was not in his person manners mind and heart an arrant FRIBBLE  THE FRIBBLERIAD  WHO is the Scribbler X Y Z  Who still writes on though little read  Whose falsehood malice envy spite  So often grin yet se dom bite  Say Garrick does he write for bread  This  friend  of yours this X Y Z  For pleasure sure not bread'twere vain  To write for that he ne'er could gain  No calls of nature to excuse him  He deals in rancour to amuse him  A  man  it seems'tis hard to say  A  woman  thena moment pray  Unknown as yet by sex or feature  Suppose we try to guess the creature  Whether a  wit  or a  pretender  Of masculine  or  female  gender  Some things it does may pass for either  And some it does belong to neither  It is so fibbing slandering spiteful  In phrase so dainty so delightful  So fond of all it reads add writes  So waggish when the maggot bites  Such spleen such wickedness and whim  It  must be  woman  and a  brim  But then the learning and the Latin  The ends of Horace come so pat in  And wanting wit it makes such shift  To fill up gaps with Pope and Swift  As cunning housewives bait their traps  And take their game with bits and scraps  For playhouse critics keen as mice  Are ever greedy ever nice  And rank abuse like toasted cheese  Will catch as many as you please  In short 'tis easily discerning  By here and there a patch of learning  The creature's  male  say all we can  It must be something  like  a man  What like a man from day to shrink  And seek revenge with pen and ink  On mischief bent his name conceal  And like a toad in secret steal  There swell with venom inward pent  Till out he crawls to give it vent  Hate  join'd with  fear  will shun the light  But  hate  and  manhood  fairly fight  'Tis manhood's mark to face the foe  And not in ambush give the blow  The savage thus less man than beast  Upon his foe will fall and feast  From bush or hole his arrows send  To wound his prey then tear and rend  For fear and hatred in conjunction  Make wretches that feel no compunction  With colours flying beat of drum  Unlike to this see Churchill come  And now like Hercules he stands  Unmask'd his face but arm'd his hands  Alike prepar'd to  write  or  drub  This holds a  pen  and that a  club  A club which nerves like his can wield  And form'd a wit like his to shield  " Mine is the Rosciad mine he cries  Who says 'tis not I say he lies  To falsehood and to fear a stranger  Not one shall fear my fame or danger  Let those who write with fear or shame  Those Craftsmen scribblers hide their name  My name is Churchill"Thus he spoke  And thrice he wav'd his knotted oak  That done he paus'dprepar'd the blow  Impartial bard for friend and foe  If such are manhood's feats and plan  Poor X Y Z will prove no  man  Nor male nor femalethen on oath  We safely may pronounce it  both  What of that wriggling fribbling race  The curse of nature and disgrace  That mixture base with fiends set forth  To taint and vilify all worth  Whose rancour knows nor bounds nor measure  Feels every passion tastes no pleasure  The want of power all peace destroying  For ever wishing ne'er enjoying  So smiling smirking soft in feature  You'd swear it was the gentlest creature  But touch its pride the  ladyfellow  From sickly pale turns deadly yellow  Male female  vanishfiends appear  And all is malice rage and fear  What in the heart breeds all this evil  Makes man on earth a very devil  Corrupts the mind and tortures sense  Malignity  with  impotence  Say Gossip Muse who lov'st to prattle  And fill the town with tittletattle  To tell a secret such a bliss is  Say for what cause these MasterMisses  To Garrick such a hatred bore  That long they wish'd to pinch him sore  To bind the monster hand and foot  Like Gulliver in Lilliput  With birchin twigs to flea his skin  And each to stick him with a pin  Are things so delicate so fell  Can Cherubims be imps of hell  Tell us how spite a scheme begot  Who laid the eggs who hatch'd the plot  O sing in nambypamby feet  Like to the subject tripping neat  Snatch every grace that fancy reaches  Relate their passions plottings speeches  You when their PANFRIBBLERIUM sat  Saw them conven'd and heard their chat  Saw all their wriggling fuming fretting  Their nodding frisking and curvetting  Each minute saw their rage grow stronger  Till the dear  things  could hold no longer  But out burst forth the dreadful vow  TO DO A DEED  but when  and  how  And  where  O Muse thy lyre newstring  The  how  the  where  the  when  to sing  Say in what sign the sun had enter'd  When these sweet souls on plotting ventur'd  'Twas when the balmy breath of May  Makes tender lambkins sport and play  When tenderer fribbles walk and dare  To gather nosegays in the air  'Twas at that time of all the year  When flowers and butterflies appear  When brooding warmth on nature lies  And circulates the blood of flies  Then Fribbles were with Fribbles leaguing  And met for plotting and intriguing  There is a place upon a hill  Where cits of pleasure take their fill  Where hautboys scream and fiddles squeak  To sweat the  ditto  once a week  Where joy of late unmix'd with noise  Of romping girls and drunken boys  Where decency sweet maid appear'd  And in her hand brought Johnny Beard  'Twas  here  for public rooms are free  They met to plot and drink their tea  Each on a sattin stool was seated  Which nicely quilted curtain'd pleated  Did all their various skill display  Each work'd his own to grace the day  Above the rest and set apart  A chair was plac'd where curious art  With lace and fringe to honour meant  Him  they should chuse their President  No longer now the kettle simmers  The smoke ascends or cotton glimmers  The tea was done the cups revers'd  Lord TRIP began"May I be curs'd  " May this right hand grow brown and speckled  " This nose be pimpled face be freckled  " May my sick monkey ne'er get up  " May my sweet Dido die in pup  " Nay may I meet a worse disaster  " My finger cut and have no plaister  " No cordial drops when dead with vapour  " Be taken short and have no paper  " If I don't feel your wrongs and shame  " With such a zeal for FRIBBLE fame  " So much my heart for vengeance thumps  " You see it raging through my jumps"  Then opening wide his milkwhite vest  They saw it fluttering in its nest  Some felt his heart and some propose  Their dropshis lordship to compose  The perturbation all agree  Was partly fidgets partly tea  While some the drops some water get  Sir COCKADOODLE Baronet  Arose"Let not this accident  " The business of the day prevent  " That lord's my friend my near relation  " But what's one lord to all our nation  " Friendship to

stretch'dout fingers and a thumb  Stuck to his hips and jutting bum  Rose upAll knew his smirking air  They clap'd and cry'dthe  chair  the  chair  He smil'd and to the honour'd seat  Paddled away with mincing feet  So have I seen on dovehouse top  With cock'dup tail and swelling crop  A pouting pigeon waddling run  Shuffling riggling noddling on  Some minutes pass'd in forms and greeting  PHIL WHIFFLE op'd the cause of meeting  " In fortyeightI well remember  " Twelve years or more the month November  " May we no more such misery know  " Since  Garrick  made OUR SEX a shew  " And gave us up to such rude laughter  " That few 'twas said could hold their water  " For He that player so mock'd our motions  " Our dress amusements fancies notions  " So lisp'd our words and minc'd our steps  " He made us pass for  demireps  " Though wisely then we laugh'd it off  " We'll now return his wicked scoff  " Genteel revenge is ever slow  " The dear Italians poison so  " But how attack him far or near  " In front my friends or in the rear"  All started up at once to speak  As if they felt some sudden tweak  'Twas quick resentment caus'd the smart  And piere'd them in the tenderest part  For these dear souls are like a spinnet  Which has both sharp and sweet within it  Press but the keys up start the quills  And thus perk'd up these  JackmyGills  Each touching brushing as they rose  Together rustled all their cloaths  Thus when all hush'd at Handel's air  Sit book in hand the  British  fair  A sudden whiz the car receives  When rustling bustling turn the leaves  In all the dignity of form  The chairman rose to hush the storm  To order call'd and try'd to frown  As all got up so all sat down  Sir DIDDLE then he thus address'd  " 'Tis  yours  to speak be mute the rest"  When thus the knight"Can I dissemble  "Conceal my rage while thus I tremble  " O FIZGIG 'tis that Garrick's name  " Now stops my voice and shakes my frame  " His pangs would pleasehis deathoh lud  "  Blood  Mr FIZGIG  blood blood blood  "  The thought too mighty for his mind  O'ercame his powers he star'd grew blind  Cold sweat his faded cheek o'erspread  Like dew upon the lily's head  He squeak'd

Where sat LORD TRIPwhere stood for use  Salts hartshorn peppermint and  eau de luce  A pause ensuedat length began  The valiant captain PATTYPAN  With kimbow'd arm and tossing head  He bridled up"Wear I this red  " Shall blood be nam'd and I be dumb  " For that and that alone I come  " Glory's my call and blood my trade  And thus"then forth he drew his blade  At once the whole assembly shrieks  At once the roses quit their cheeks  Each face o'ercast with deadly white  Nor paint itself could stand the fright  The roof with  order order  rings  And all cry outNO NAKED THINGS  The captain sheath'd his wrath in pride  And stuck the bodkin by his side  More soft more gentle than a lamb  The reverend Mister MARJORAM  Arosebut first with finger's tip  He pats the patch upon his lip  Then o'er it glides his healing tongue  And thus he saidor rather sung  " Sure 'tis the error of the moon  " What fight a mimic a buffoon  " In France he has the church's curse  " And England's church is ten times worse  " Have you not read the holy writ  " Just publish'd by a reverend wit  " That every Actor is a  thing  " A  Merry Andrew paper king  " A  puppet  made of rags and wood  " The  lowest son of

thus a precious life  " In such a low  unnatural  strife  " And sure to stab him would be cruel  " I vote forarsenick in his gruel"  He said and smil'd then sunk with grace  Lick'd the patch'd lip and wip'd his face  A buz of rapture fill'd the room  Like bees about a shrub in bloom  All whisper'd round"Was it not fine  " O veryVery'Twas divine"  But soon as from the chair was seen  A waving hand and speaking mein  A calm came onthe Chairman bow'd  And smirking spoke"I'm pleas'd and proud  " To mix my sentiments with yours  " 'Tis prudence every point secures  " Two friends with rapture I have heard  " One favours  arsenick  one the  sword    " In both there's dangerbut succeeding  " Short pangs in  poisoning  less in  bleeding  " A sudden death's not worth a shilling  " I'd have our foe nine years a killing"  Then from his bosom forth he drew  A crowquill pen"Behold for you  " And your revenge this instrument  " From hell it came to me 'twas sent  " Within is poison sword and all  " Its point a dagger dipt in gall  " Keen lingering pangs the foe shall feel  " While clouds the hand that stabs conceal  " With this while living I'll dissect him  " Create his errors then detect 'em  " Swell tiny faults to monstrous size  " Then point them out to purblind eyes  " Which like Polonious gaze in air  " For  ouzel camel whale  or  bear  " His very merit I'll pervert  " And swear the ore is sand and dirt  " I know his quick and warm sensations  " And thence will work him more vexations  " Attended with some noisy cit  " Of strong belief but puny wit  " I'll take my seat be rude and loud  " That each remark may reach the crowd  " At Lear will laugh be hard as rocks  " And sit at Scrub like barbers blocks  " When all is still we'll roar like thunder  " When all applausebe mute and wonder  " In this I boast uncommon merit  " I like have prais'd his genius spirit  " His various powers I own divert me  " 'Tis his  success  alone has hurt me  " My patriot hand like Brutus strikes  " And stabs and wounds where most it likes  "  He  as a Roman gave the blow  " I as a FRIBBLE stab your foe  " He mourn'd the deed would not prevent it  " I'll do the deedand then  Some MSS read  repent it  lament it"  At this all tongues their hearts obey  A burst of rapture forc'd its way  BravoBravissimoHuzza  All rose at oncethen hand in hand  Each link'd to each the heroes stand  Like Fairies form a magic round  Then vow and tremble at the sound  By all that's dear to human kind  By every tye can FRIBBLES bind  They vow that with their latest breath  They'll stand by  Fizgig  life or death  The kiss goes round the parting friends  The chair is leftth' assembly ends  Then each his spirit to recruit  For biscuits call and candied fruit  And sip his flutter'd nerves to heal  Warm water sack and orangepeel  Then made as warm as warmth could make them  All to their several homes betake them  Save one who harrass'd with the chair  Remain'd at Hampstead for the air  Now GARRICK for the future know  Where most you have  deserv'd  a foe  Can you their rage with justice blame  To you they owe their public shame  Though long they slept they were not dead  Their malice wakes in X Y Z  And now bursts forth their treasur'd gall  Thro'  him  COCK FRIBBLE of them all  THE SICK MONKEY  "After Mr Garrick had been abroad about a year and half satiated with the amusements and pleasures of the Continent he turned his thoughts towards his native country But before he would set out for Calais he was resolved to put in practice his usual method of preventing censure and blunting the edge of ridicule by anticipation For this purpose before he left Paris he sat down very seriously to write a kind of satirical poem on himself it was called  The Sick Monkey  and the plan of it was the talk or censure of other animals and reptiles on him and his travels and this poem he sent from Paris to a friend Mr Colman with a request that he would get it printed to prepare his reception in London"  Davies's life of Garrick  Vol P  A FABLE  "Thursday Afternoon DAVID GARRICK  Esq  arrived at his House in Southamptonstreet CoventGarden"  Public Advertiser April    First published  THE SICK MONKEY A FABLE  ADDRESSED To Mr GARRICK upon his Arrival  REturn'd from travel to your native shore  Again to make us laugh or cry  To turn your back we hope no more  Nor from your colours fly  Whether you fled for health or quiet  Harrass'd with rule or sick with riot  Or whether you have kept us lean  As slander says  With lenten plays  To make our appetites more keen  Whether it be or this or that  No matter what  For we before the curtain see but blindly  Now you are come  To us and home  We greet you Sir and greet you kindly  My Muse is honest as she's bold  A forward Miss  Who loves to pratebut hold  I quite forgot  Before I tell you what she  is  I'll tell you what she's  not  No bird of prey with wild uproar  Like  Churchill  to disturb the grove  Nor comes she like the harmless dove  To bill and coo and love  And nothing more  In short to speak more plainly  Nor be it thought I speak it vainly  Averse to flattery and spite  She is a modest sober dame  I wish all females were the same  And will not scratch or bite  She is not one of those  Who shew their genius in their dress  Whose inky fingers unpinn'd cloaths  The slipshod shoe and snuffy nose  Denote her wit and sluttishness  Who with a Play like pistol cock'd in hand  Bid Managers to stand  " Deliver Sir  " Your thoughts on this  " Before you stir  "  But MadamMiss    " Your answer strait  " I will not wait  "  'Tis fit you know    " I'll hear no reason  " This very season  " AY or No"  Not to kill more precious time  In dropping sense to pick up rhime  Or like friend  Shandy  rattle  And lose my matter in my prattle  Without much wit digression's tame  So I shall give it o'er  And beat about the bush no more  But start my game  The Critick's pen has various uses  It praises now and now abuses  Does this and that  Or both together  As fancy strikes or rhimes come pat  Stabs with the point or tickles with the feather  Authors like bees buz round and round  Dramatic ground  For all they meet  Have sharp and sweet  They do no ill  Would fools fit still  Provoke 'em and they're dangerous things  And ev'ry Player  Should equally beware  Their honey as their stings  GARRICK thou mighty chief of kings and queens  Despotic tyrant of the scenes  Think'st thou all human race to mock  In buskin and in sock  And will not fools  Thy mock'ry ridicules  From CHALKSTONE's Lord to dainty FRIBBLE  Rave chatter write  In various ways display their spite  For all can talk and some can scribble  Others again  Take up the pen  In panegyrick's gaudy colours paint thee  As humour flows  Now friends now foes  In prose and verse and verse and prose  Bedevil thee and saint thee  And can such Criticks teaze thee  And can such praises please thee  O if they can  Alas poor man  No more deride  Thy neighbour's weakness folly pride  But cure thy own  If thou art able  While I make known  My friendship to thee in a Fable  An APE there was an APE of merit  A lively sportive pleasant thing  Had so much fancy whim and spirit  And made such sport  He got to Court  And shew'd his tricks before the LIONKING  Such honour gave him fame  And rais'd his name  From far and near they came to see  This MONKEYprodigy  Though none were more expert and quick  In tumbling backward o'er a stick  Though none with a more lordly pride  And happy ease did e'er bestride  The rugged Russian bear  Though he could skip it up and down  And pick the pocket of a clown  Or whip away his hat  Or fondle with a cat  The wonder of the Fair  This was not allhe had the art  Of acting still a higher part  To each profession that he saw  Physick Divinity or Law  He ludicrously shap'd him  So much possess'd of all their notions  Their humours oddities and motions  That not a soul escap'd him  In ridicule's enchanted glass  Whatever forms are shewn  We all can see another's face  But never find our own  To flatter SELF we all incline  For SELF we plan and labour  " Pluck not good Sir a hair of mine  " And you may scalp my neighbour"  Each laugh'd to see his friend the jest  And prais'd the MONKEY highly  Not openly but slily  At court you find a thousand such  But what was best  Though there were none  By turns he did not fall upon  Each thought himself the only one  The MIMIC could not touch  Blest fools who boast your happy lot  From ridicule secure  Though leopardstain'd you see no spot  INIMITABLY pure  Whether the  Jackanapes  was clever  Or the court not over nice  By various tricks he crept in favour  And for those tricks had DOUBLE PRICE  Thus FORTUNE in a whim  Resolv'd to turn his brain  And fill'd his cup up to the brim  Th' in toxicating cup of joy  Which better heads than his destroy  No wonder he was vain  Whenever gossip FAME prates loud  ENVY in turn as loud will tattle  And scribblers to her standard croud  Cry HAVOCK and prepare for battle  MALEVOLENCE with lynx's eye  The most minute defects will spy  And even FRIENDSHIP shame upon our kind  Is to those faults not always blind  The looking up fatigues the sight  And mortals when they soar  Should they once reach a certain height  All wish to have them lower  And friends there are in this good town  Will lend a hand to help them down  About about my pen  Nor lose the Fable in thy railing  But to our MONKEY back again  Who found that Brutes as well as Men  Have this same cursed failing  The moment he got fame and wealth  How ill exchang'd for ease and health  The envious crew  Poor PUG pursue  Abuse his active pliant spirit  But chiefly those  Were mark'd his foes  Who felt a satire in his merit  The dull and sluggish were the first  To shew their teeth if not to bite  The  Hog  the  Bear  the  Ass  had burst  Had they not grunted roar'd and bray'd their spite  This furious stir  Awak'd the Critic CUR  Hound Greyhound Mastiff  answer to the call  The little Dogs and all  The game's in view  For man and beast  Scandal's a feast  Where both with appetite fall to  The bloated  Toad  in silence stole  To gather poison in her hole  As mischief never knows delay  She rouz'd the  Viper  in her way  A neighbour and her bosom friend  For tho' she crawl'd and could not run  She kept this maxim strict'y  Ye sons of Law attend  That mischief if it must be done  'Twere well it were done quickly  But then his  friends  Did they oppose  A lukewarm friend's the worst of foes  The  Goat  look'd wife and wagg'd his beard  The  Spaniel  shook his ears  The Fox turn'd up his pointed nose  Thoughtful and dull the  Cat  appear'd  Or else in whispers purr'd her fears  The  Steed  a lone was firm and fast  The generous  Steed  stood by him to the last  PUG sickens mopes and looks like death  Speaks faintly and scarce draws his breath  Some call it Megrim some the Spleen  Words often us'd that little mean  But Scandal with her face demure  Hints it is heat of blood  By which is understood  An old Amour  In short they ransack all diseases  And give him that their fancy pleases  Among the rest  That fits him best  Which best the Doctor serves  Of which he most avails him  When knowledge fails him  And with a face of wisdom calls it  Nerves  The  Horse  who saw his friend's distress  Did thus his honest mind express  " Come prithee rouze this life's the devil  " What sigh and sob and keep within  " What YOU who us'd to frisk and revel  " For ever chatter and for ever grin  " Zoundsit would make a parson swear  " Get on my back and take the air"  Away they went and as they pass  The  Hog  the  Dog  the  Bear  the  Ass  Pug  's diff'rent foes in diff'rent places  If in the least they shew'd their spite  The  Horse  would winny snort and bite  And throw  the dirt  into their faces  For all this care  This exercise and air  Yet still the MONKEY pin'd  For well we are assur'd  That when the grief is in the mind  'Tis sooner got than cur'd  In this condition  What to prescribe hima Physician  There is a certain way of life  Which all must take  For fashion's sake  Or be with all the world at strife  The rich must to the Doctor give  The poor to Nature trust and live  It must be soor could the tribe  Of those who quack or who prescribe  In folly find fuch ample gain  Could nostrums swell the  Advertiser  Or the wise heads of  Warwicklane  Buy Wig enough to make them wiser  Our patient cannot wait  " Send for a doctor strait"  But not a formal halfbred fool  Who cures by chance and kills by rule  A perriwigpated block  Physicians for the Brutes were Fowls  And tho' the sworn practitioners were OWLS  They chose a neighbouring COCK  He enters with a stately tread  His comb and wattles dignify his head  No outward sign was ever seen  That promis'd half so much within  And yetye sons of Physick blush  The wine was better than the bush  His learning back'd by penetration  A kind of Radcliffeinspiration  Bound by no partial pedant laws  Shot through each symptom to its cause  A rarity without dispute  He was  an honest  COCK to boot  Yet with this genius worth and knowledge  He had a stain a deep disgrace  No mortal merit could efface  He was not of the College  But holdour hero out of sight  Must now again be brought to light  We left him in the Doctor's care  Who with a serious face  Attending to the case  Did thus his mind declare  " I could like any learned brother  " With a hard name my ign'rance smother  " 'Tis one of our establish'd laws  " Which daily we fulfil  " Whene'er our skill can't find a cause  " To make a cause to suit our skill  " Thus we seldom meet disgrace  " We only can mistake the case  " What are these papers by your side  "  'Tis physick Sir to cure my pride  "  This heap of papers verse and prose  "  Is the joint malice of my foes  "  There's not a day but something's sent me  "  To fret me and torment me  "  This said the conversation stops  For PUG was faint and calls for drops  With rage subdu'd the patient panted  Which struck a light the Doctor wanted  Who thus pronounc'd"I know your ail  " 'Tis not in your heart or head  " As some have said  "  Where then good Doctor  in your  tail  "  His Tail of most uncommon make  In action like the serpent kind  A thousand diff'rent forms could take  Twirl twist and vary to his mind  If Lords were ap'dthis pliant queue  Was cross his breast a ribbon blue  Or green or redand then slapdash  A Chaplain's scarf or Col'nel's sash  Whene'er the city struck his brain  'Twas round his neck a Lord Mayor's chain  Or were his part to lisp and trip it  Hey presto'twas a lady's tippet  But now depriv'd of spirit life and strength  It lies a languid lank inanimated length  The Doctor paus'dthen silence broke  " I'll strike a master stroke  " This Tail of yours we must amend  " Give it new life and force  " And if we gain that end  " The rest will come of course  " With that same malice of your foes  " Both verse and prose  " Curl it each night and morning  " But then take warning  " Never again to cast your eyes  " On what is wrote or may be writ  " Whether it is or is not wit  " For  there  the magic lies"  'Tis best by craft and not by book  To cure these mental fevers  The MONKEY all for gospel took  The sick are great believers  So well the Doctor's words he noted  His tail that night was  papilloted  His greedy eyes to cure his head  No more on paperdiet fed  The cause remov'd effects will cease  Depriv'd of oil the flame goes out  Our APE began to be at peace  His Tail to move about  The more 'twas curl'd  The more 'twas twirl'd  With head and heart  The Tail took part  Life frisks in ev'ry vein  PUG  was himself again    The MONKEY got his health  The Doctor wealth  Of patients he had plenty  For though the cure was half a joke  'Twas wonder'd at by silly folk  And that's nineteen in twenty  To fix his cure Historians say  That like Sir WILFUL in the play  He talk'd of foreign parts  Left all his griefs and cares behind  Sail'd with the first fair wind  And hey for ITALY and Arts  What he got there no creature knows  Nor he himself can tell us  What lightly comes as lightly goes  With all such pretty fellows  He skip'd the country o'er  And then return'd  With what he learn'd  A greater MONKEY than before  THE Fable told the Moral comes  GARRICK don't fret and bite your thumbs  But take the  Monkey's  place  The same's your case  The same prescription we advise  Should Spleen and Spite  Nay though Critic Truth should write  For who is always in the right  Shut your ears and close your eyes  Whate'er is publish'd buy the heap  You'll have it cheap  But not to read or hear it read  Would you strike detraction dead  The Doctor's method cannot fail  Keep the poison from your HEAD  And clap it to your TAIL  AN ODE UPON DEDICATING A BUILDING AND ERECTING A STATUE TO SHAKESPEARE AT STRATFORD UPON AVON  This Ode was spoken by Mr GARRICK th September at Stratford upon Avon and the ensuing Winter at DruryLane Theatre    ADVERTISEMENT  COULD some gentlemen of approved ability have been prevailed upon to do justice to the subject of the following Ode the present apology would have been unnecessarybut as it was requisite to produce something of this kind upon the occasion and the lot having unluckily fallen on the person perhaps the least qualified to succeed in the attempt it is hoped the candour of the public will esteem the performance rather as an act of duty than vanity in the author  As some newspaper writers have illiberally endeavoured to shake the poetic character of our immortal bard too deeply indeed rooted in the heart to be affected by them it is recommended to those who are not sufficiently established in their dramatic faith to peruse a work lately published called  An Essay on the Genius and Writings of  SHAKESPEARE by which they will with much satisfaction be convinced that  England  may justly boast the honour of producing the greatest dramatic poet in the world  To strengthen and justify the general admiration of this astonishing Genius it has been  thought proper to subjoin to the Ode some undeniable testimonies both in prose and verse of his unequalled original talents  These are extracted from the Works of Ben Jonson Milton Dryden Pope Thomson Johnson Warton Seward Akenside Gray Mason Churchill Jago Whitehead Addison Rowe Voltaire Theobald Hanmer Lyttelton Warburton Dodd Steevens Capel Hurd Murphy Colman Walpole and Mrs Montague In the present collection they are omitted    If it shall be found that  speaking  that part of the Ode which has usually been conveyed in recitative produces a better effect the Author flatters himself he may lay claim to some little merit on that account As to the Ode itself he presents it to the public as an object of their goodnatureto his friends as an exercise of their partialityto his enemies as a lucky opportunity of venting their wit humour criticism spleen or whatever else they please should they think it worthy of their notice  ODE  TO what blest genius

demigod  Who Avon's flow'ry margin trod  While sportive  Fancy  round him flew  Where  Nature  led him by the hand  Instructed him in all she knew  And gave him absolute command  'Tis he 'tis he  " The god of our idolatry"  To him the song the Edifice we raise  He merits all our wonder all our praise  Yet ere impatient joy break forth  In sounds that lift the soul from earth  And to our spellbound minds impart  Some faint idea of his magic art  Let awful silence still the air  From the dark cloud the hidden light  Bursts tenfold bright  Prepare prepare prepare  Now swell at once the

Tho'  Philip's  fam'd unconquer'd son  Had ev'ry bloodstain'd laurel won  He sigh'dthat his creative word  Like that which rules the skies  Could not bid other nations rise  To glut his yet unsated sword  But when our  Shakespeare's  matchless pen  Like  Alexander's  sword had done with men  He heav'd no sigh he made no moan  Not limited to human kind  He fir'd his wonderteeming mind  Rais'd other worlds and beings of his own  AIR  When Nature smiling hail'd his birth  To him unbounded pow'r was given  The whirlwind's wing to sweep the sky  "  The frenzyrowling eye  To glance from heav'n

throne  Unaided and alone  In dreadful state  The subject passions round him wait  Who tho' unchain'd and raging there  He checks inflames or turns their mad career  With that superior skill  Which winds the fiery steed at will  He gives the awful word  And they all foaming trembling own him for their Lord  With these his slaves he can controul  Or charm the soul  So realiz'd are all his golden

Though crimes from death and torture fly  The swifter muse  Their flight pursues  Guilty mortals more than die  They live indeed but live to feel  The scourge and wheel  "  On the torture of the mind they lie  "  Should harrass'd nature sink to rest  The Poet wakes the scorpion in the breast  Guilty mortals more than die  When our  Magician  more inspir'd  By charms and spells and incantations fir'd  Exerts his most tremendous pow'r  The thunder growls the heav'ns low'r  And to his darken'd throne repair  The  Demons  of the deep and  Spirits  of the air  But soon these horrors pass away

all but its care  No load but of flesh will he bear  He laughs off his pack  Takes a cup of old sack  And away with all sorrow and care  Like the rich rainbow's various dyes  Whose circle sweeps o'er

By Mr Garrick first acted April before the Author's appearance on the stage at Drurylane for the benefit of Mr Giffard This performance was a sketch of the very popular Drama afterwards so frequently represented at Drurylane Theatre In its first state it contained only the outlines of some of the characters  LETHE or ESOP IN THE SHADES  Spoken by Mrs  Clive  and Mr  Raftor  in the Characters of Miss  Lucy  and Mr  Thomas  See  The Virgin Unmask'd  by Fielding    Thomas  FArewel my cares farewel domestick strife  How blest the husband when reform'd the wife  Lucy  I'm not reform'd  Tho  Not reform'd my dear  Lucy  No  Tho  No  Lucy  No no no can't you hear  Tho  Then all my hopes are gone  Lucy  With all my heart  You may go tooI'm ready sir to part  Tho  Did you not promise Lucy to reform  Lucy  You promis'd tooand how did you perform  You well may drop your lip and change your saucy tone  Go get you hence you worthless drone  Tho  Pray follow Lucy do  Lucy  I'll follow straight  My pleasuresnot you  When thou art gone I'll ne'er on man rely  Next time by golls I'll taste before I buy  Contented now the husband is retir'd  Like other wives I'll stay and be admir'd  And now I'll chuse a lover to my goust  Irish and French I've try'd but they'll not do  I must have British fare and one of you  First I'll beg leave to view the upper places  Ha ha they grin so one can't distinguish faces  I'll pass the footmen they're not worth my care  I married oneand lazy rogues they are  Next to the boxes let my eyes descend  I surely there shall find some one my friend  O lack how fine they are but we shall ne'er agree  They like themselves so wellthey'll ne'er like me  Besides of all things I abhor a beau  For when try'd 'tis doubtful whether man or no  Next let me view my last resortthe Pit  Here's choice enough the Merchant Soldier Cit  The surely Critic and the threadbare Wit  As for the Rakes they are too common grown  For Men who strive at all are good at none  Nor will the Wit or surly Critic serve me  For one would beat me and the other starve me  The Merchant now and Soldier's left behind  To both I feel my heart somewhat inclin'd  Which shall I choose Each has a noble soul  Which shall I have I'll have 'em both by goll  No doubt you'll all approve my patriot passion  My heart is fix'd for Trade and Navigation  I hope you'll not refuse your gen'rous voice  Applaud me Britons and approve my choice  II EPILOGUE to the MOCKDOCTOR  Printed in the Gentleman's Magazine Sept with the signature  G  The same Letter is added to several other Pieces afterwards acknowledged by Mr Garrick    HOW happy chance may alter one's condition  Behold poor Gregory a rich physician  My axe is chang'd and dwindled to a pen  To trees once fatal fatal now to men  No more shall woollen caps these looks disgrace  Of scanty bobs full bottoms shall take place  Bespread my rump and dignify my face  Ladies survey me well behind before  The Doctor now plain Gregory no more  Declare your thoughts are any of our tribe  Better prepar'd to visit or prescribe  I've got my dress have taken my degrees  Prepar'd at once to kill and take my fees  Ay but says some this Doctor scarce can read  Does he know when to blister purge or bleed  Learning 'tis true like many more I want  But then like many more I prate and cant  For tho' my brethren may look wise and big  Their knowledge lies not in the head but wig  If this is granted all may plainly see  That few in knowledge can compare with me  Stroaks his wig  This night a female patient try'd my skill  And tho' I gave her neither slop nor pill  By other means I soon perform'd a cure  Miss could not talkno common case I'm sure  Punch I prescrib'd the best specifick potion  To oil the tongue and give that member motion  But soon as e'er I knew the maid's condition  I thought a pimp more proper than physician  In short I brought the lovers face to face  The best prescription in a ticklish case  They married soon and fell to bill and cooing  Which op'd her lips and set her tongue agoing  Now ladies if you stand my friends you're sure  If love's your case to find a speedy cure  I'm always yours employ me as you please  Pimp or Physician give me but my fees  III PROLOGUE to  A Comedy by Mr Love first acted at Goodman's Fields Nov In this Play which is founded on Richardson's very popular Novel Mr Garrick performed and as is genenerally imagined wrote the character of Jack Spatter  PAMELA  Spoken by Mr GARRICK  AS in the airy regions of romance  The advent'rous Knight sets out with shield and lance  Strait his disinterested valour flies  To helpless Damsels and to Beauty's cries  This only motive rising in his breast  The godlike pleaof innocence distress'd  Thus dares our Author Errant of tonight  In Virtue's aid romantically fight  Sacred to Her the champion pen he draws  Enough rewardedto support her cause  Tonight his honest labour means to prove  A lowborn virtue worth a great man's love  An honest pride where conscious honour glows  An artless innocencewhence truth still flows  A sense proceeding but from nature's light  For little knowledge serves us to be right  A merit greatly poor that far outshines  The glare of titles or the wealth of mines  Such stedfast honesty should find success  O'er the abandon'd authors of distress  O'er those who glory to betray a maid  Who welcome guilt and make deceit a trade  Yet some there are less liable to blame  Who only want reflection to reclaim  Who bend unthinking to the Syren's voice  The reprobates of custom not of choice  Who deaf to precept plead example still  And think the mode indemnifies the ill  To such our Author offers this address  Not certain nor despairing of success  Amongst this cast of men he hopes to find  Some convertsfor the honour of mankind  On minds like these his morals may prevail  And who escap'd a Sermon feel this Tale  IV EPILOGUE to the LYING VALET  Farce by Mr Garrick first acted in Goodman's Fields Nov    Spoken by Mr GARRICK  THAT I'm a lying rogue you all agree  And yet look round the world and you will see  How many more my betters lye as fast as me  Against this vice we all are ever railing  And yet so tempting is it so prevailing  You'll find but few without this useful failing  Lady or Abigail my Lord or Will  The lye goes round and the ball's never still  My lies were harmless told to shew my parts  And not like those when tongues belye their hearts  In all professions you will find this flaw  And in the greatest too in physic and in law  The gouty serjeant cries with formal pause  " Your plea is good my friend don't starve the cause"  But when my Lord decrees for t'other side  Your costs of suit convince youthat he ly'd  A Doctor comes with formal wig and face  First feels your pulse then thinks and knows your case  " Your fever's slight not dangerous I assure you  " Keep warm and  repetatur baustus  sir will cure you"  Around the bed next day his friends are crying  The patient dies the Doctor's paid for lying  The Poet willing to secure the Pit  Gives out his play has humour taste and wit  The cause comes on and while the judges try  Each groan and catcall gives the bard the lye  Now let us ask pray what the ladies do  They too will fib a little  entre nous  " Lord says the Prude her face behind her fan  " How can our sex have any joy in man  " As for my part the best could ne'er deceive me  " And were the race extinct 'twould never grieve me  " Their sight is odious but their touchO gad  " The thought of that's enough to drive one mad"  Thus rails at man the squeamish Lady Dainty  Yet weds at fiftyfive a rake of twenty  In short a beau's intrigues a lover's sighs  The courtier's promise the rich widow's cries  And patriot's zeal are seldom more than lies  Sometimes you'll see a man belye his nation  Nor to his country shew the least relation  For instance now  A cleanly  Dutchman  or a  Frenchman  grave  A sober  German  or a  Spaniard  brave  An  Englishman  a coward or a slave  Mine tho' a fibbing was an honest art  I serv'd my master play'd a faithful part  Rank me not therefore 'mongst the lying crew  For tho' my tongue was false my heart was true  V EPILOGUE to REGULUS  A Tragedy by Mr Havard acted first Time February at Drurylane Theatre    Spoken by Mrs WOFFINGTON  IF one could credit what these Poets tell us  These Greeks and Romans were surprizing fellows  But when compar'd with heroes nowadays  Who can believe one word our Author says  Tonight fam'd Regulus appear'd before ye  Brimfull of honour and his country's glory  So fraught with virtue and with patriot zeal  He laid down life to serve the public weal  Bless me was ever man so wildly frantick  We have no patriots now are so romantick  We've no State Quixotes as they had of yore  Our Patriots huff 'tis true and rant and roar  And talk of this and thatbut nothing more  Their ladies too were form'd with strange ingredients  They lov'd their husbands and were all obedience  And though their mates for many years would roam  The constant doves would stay till they come home  Martia  if what they say can gain belief  For loss of husband almost dy'd with grief  And what is stranger still they all agree  That Regulus was turn'd of sixtythree  Would any modern lady break her heart  Because an aged spouse resolves to part  Would she to thwart his will be so uncivil  O nothe man might go to Carthageor the devil  What mighty stuff compos'd these sons of freedom  The Classicks say I'm told by those that read 'em  That they were mortals of such wond'rous merit  That e'en when old they fought and liv'd with spirit  Romans at sixtythree as I'm alive  Were better men than ours at thirtyfive  In short if all that's said and wrote be true  And they when old such mighty feats could do  O Lord they play'd the devil sure at twentytwo  Thus far with trifling jests to please the age  And to preserve the custom of the stage  And now let serious nobler thoughts impart  The warmest wishes to each English heart  May ev'ry Matron  Marcia's  truth approve  And ev'ry Maid like constant  Clelia  love  May ev'ry  Decius  find a faithful friend  And ev'ry  Corvus  meet the villain's end  May ev'ry Briton hold his Country dear  And Truth not Party ev'ry action steer  May Regulus's conduct point the way  And no false glitter lead our youths astray  May ev'ry virtue be transplanted home  And Britain boast the worth of ancient Rome  VI EPILOGUE to The ASTROLOGER  A Comedy by Mr Ralph acted at Drurylane April In an Advertisement prefixed to this Play the Author complains that ten years had elapsed before it could obtain the favour of a representation that he was not unknown to the great nor destitute of private friends and having devoted the most serious of his studies to the service of the publick he had some reason to expect the public favour Yet that the receipts of the house upon the first night were but twentyone pounds and when the Manager risqued a second to give the Author a chance for a Benefit he was obliged to shut up his doors for want of an audience  Biog Dramatica  Vol ii p    Spoken by Mrs WOFFINGTON  WELL what's the sentence What's our Author's fate  I fear his conj'ring scheme is out of date  For look but round 'mongst men of all conditions  You'll find no conj'rers now but Politicians  Consulting stars is now quite out of fashion  Our wiser dames consult their inclination  And as a sure defence against all ills  Are led by those unerring guidestheir wills  No planet's aspect now controuls your birth  We are the stars alone preside on earth  I told our Author so'twas true he swore  The man is marriedand could say no more  Long have our senseless playwrights void of spirit  From Moliere's humour pilfer'd all their merit  Our Author scorn'd in foreign climes to roam  He thought some merit might be found at home  Upon the Patriot principle he stood  And tho' his head may fail his heart is good  But leaving him to mourn for scribbling crimes  I'll take his hint and warn the present times  A modish frenzy so corrupts the town  That nought but  Alamode de France  goes down  We all submit to this fantastic yoke  Like them we dress we dance we eat we joke  From top to toe they change us at their will  All but our heartsand those are British still  Rouze rouze for shame This modish pest oppose  Nor meanly ape your vain insulting foes  To kill this fatal weed for ever toil  Nor let it e'er take root in British soil  Let low inglorious arts to France belong  The close deceit false heart and double tongue  Let us by noble generous arts be known  By valour wit and honesty our own  Produce your Worthies Britain and be taught  That none like Shakespeare writ or Marlb'rough fought  By these to former heights your glories raise  Nor yield to France the Laurels or the Bays  VII PROLOGUE To the SUSPICIOUS HUSBAND  A Comedy by Dr Benjamin Hoadley acted first Time at Covent Garden Theatre Feb    Spoken by Mr RYAN  WHILE other culprits brave it to the last  Nor beg for mercy 'till the judgment's past  Poets alone as conscious of their crimes  Open their trials with imploring rhymes  Thus cram'd with flattery and low submission  Each trite dull Prologue is the bard's petition  A stale device to calm the critick's fury  And bribe at once the judges and the jury  But what avail such poor repeated arts  The whimp'ring scribbler ne'er can touch your hearts  Nor ought an illtim'd pity to take place  Fast as they rise destroy th' increasing race  The vermin else will run the nation o'er  By saving one you breed a million more  Tho' disappointed Authors rail and rage  At fancy'd parties and a senseless age  Yet still has justice triumph'd on the stage  Thus speaks and thinks the Author of today  And saying this has little more to say  He asks no friend his partial zeal to shew  Nor fears the groundless censures of a foe  He knows no friendship can protect the fool  Nor will an Audience be a party's tool  'Tis inconsistent with a freeborn sprit  To side with folly or to injure merit  By your decision he must fall or stand  Nor tho' he feels the lash will blame the hand  VIII EPILOGUE to the same PLAY  Spoken by Mrs PRITCHARD  THO' the young Smarts I see begin to sneer  And the old sinners cast a wicked leer  Be not alarm'd ye Fairyou've nought to fear  No wanton hint no loose ambiguous sense  Shall flatter vicious taste at your expence  Leaving for once those shameless arts in vogue  We give a  Fable  for the  Epilogue  An Ass there was our Author bid me say  Who needs must writehe didand wrote a Play  The parts were cast to various beasts and fowl  Their stage a barnthe Manager an Owl  The house was cramm'd at fix with friends and foes  Rakes Wits and Criticks Citizens and Beaux  These characters appear'd in different shapes  Of Tigers Foxes Horses Bulls and Apes  With others too of lower rank and station  A perfect abstract of the brute creation  Each as he felt mark'd out the Author's faults  And thus the  Connoisseurs  express'd their thoughts  The Critickcurs first snarl'dthe rules are broke  Time Place and Action sacrific'd to joke  The Goats cry'd out 'twas formal dull and chaste  Not writ for beasts of gallantry and taste  The HornedCattle were in piteous taking  At Fornication Rapes and Cuckoldmaking  The Tigers swore he wanted fire and passion  The Apes condemn'dbecause it was the fashion  The generous steeds allow him proper merit  Here mark'd his faults and there approv'd his spirit  While brother bards bray'd forth with usual spleen  And as they heard exploded every scene  When Reynard's thoughts were ask'd the shrugging sage  Fam'd for hypocrisy and worn with age  Condemn'd the shameless licence of the stage  At which the Monkey skipp'd from box to box  And whisper'd round the judgment of the Fox  Abus'd the moderns talk'd of Rome and Greece  Bilk'd every Boxkeeper and damn'd the piece  Now every Fable has a Moral to it  Be Churchman Statesman any thingbut Poet  In Law or Physick quack in what you will  Cant and grimace conceal the want of skill  Secure in these his gravity may pass  But here no artifice can hide the Ass  IX EPILOGUE  This Epilogue in a late collection has been erroneously ascribed to Dr Johnson who wrote only the Prologue on this occasion  Spoken by Mrs WOFFINGTON at the Opening of DruryLane Theatre  SWEET doings truly we are finely fobb'd  And at one stroke of all our pleasures robb'd  No beaux behind the scenes  'tis innovation  Under the specious name of reformation  Public complaint  forsooth is made a puff  Sense order decency and such like stuff  But arguments like these are mere pretence  The beaux 'tis known ne'er give the least offence  Are men of chastest conduct and amazing sense  Each actress now a lock'dup nun must be  And priestly managers must keep the key  I know their selfish reasons tho' they tell us  While smarts and wits and other pretty fellows  Murmur their passions to our flutt'ring hearts  The stage stands still and we neglect our parts  But how mistaken in this silly notion  We hear 'em talk without the least emotion  Just as our tea we sip each tender strain  Too weak to warm the heart or reach the brain  If harmless why are we debarr'd our rights  Damsels distress'd have ever found their knights  Shall we the  Dulcineas  of the stage  In vain ask succour in this fighting age  Will you Choice Spirits who direct the town  Suffer such impositions to go down  Can it be thought this law will ever pass  While doors are only wood and windows glass  Besides our playhouse guards are pamve men  Strike without fear they must not strike again  Ev'n  Fribble  here to draw his sword may venture  May  curse the creters  beat his man and enter  The jealous Moor not roars in louder strains  Than all our Nymphs for loss of absent Swains  " We had been happy tho' the House had fail'd  " Masters and all had not this scheme prevail'd  " For ever now farewell the plumed beaux  " Who make ambitionto consist in cloaths  " Farewel conquetry and all Greenroom joys  " Earthrilling whispers  A famous toyman in Pallmall    Deard's  deluding toys  " Soulmelting flatt'ry which ev'n prudes can move  " Sighstearsand all the circumstance of love  " Farewell  " But oh ye dreadful criticks whose rude throats  " Can make both play'rs and masters change their notes  " 'Tis in your pow'ryou any lengths will run  " Help us or elseour  occupation's  gone"  X EPILOGUE to the FOUNDLING  A Comedy by Mr Moore acted at Drurylane February    Spoken by Mrs CIBBER  I KNOW you all expect from seeing me  An Epilogue of strictest purity  Some formal lecture spoke with prudish face  To shew our present joking giggling race  True joy consists ingravity and grace  But why am I for ever made the tool  Of every squeamish moralizing fool  Condemn'd to sorrow all my life must I  Ne'er make you laugh because I make you cry  Madam say they your face denotes your heart  'Tis your's to melt us in the mournful part  So from the looks our hearts they prudish deem  Alas poor souls  we are not what we seem  Tho' prudence oft' our inclination smothers  We grave ones love a jokeas well as others  From such dull stuff what profit can you reap  You cry'tis very fine  yawns  and fall asleep  appy that bard blest with uncommon art  Whose wit can chear and not corrupt the heart  Happy that Play'r whose skill can chase the spleen  And leave no worse inhabitant within  'Mongst friends our Author is a modest man  But wicked wits will cavil at his plan  Damn it says one this stuff will never pass  The  Girl  wants Nature and the  Rake's  an ass  Had I like Belmont heard a damsel's cries  I would

and Kingdoms rise and sall  So with the mighty to compare the small  Thro' int'rest whim or if you please thro' fate  We feel commotions in our mimic state  The sock and buskin fly from stage to stage  A year's alliance is with usan age  And where's the wonder All surprize must cease  When we reflect how int'rest or caprice  Makes real Kings break articles of peace  Strengthen'd by new allies our foes prepare  Cry havock and let slip the dogs of war  To shake our souls the  In which papers was this paragraph  "We hear that Mr Quin Mrs Cibber Mr Barry Mr Macklin and Mrs Woffington are engaged at CoventGarden Theatre for the ensuing season"  On the part of Drurylane Theatre it was notified That two celebrated Actors from Dublin were engaged to perform there also Miss Bellamy and a new Actress Signor Fausan the comic dancer and his wife and a Gentleman to sing who has not been on any stage  papers of the day  Drew forth the adverse pow'r in dread array  A pow'r might strike the boldest with dismay  Yet fearless still we take the field with spirit  Arm'd  capapé  in selfsufficient merit  Our ladies too with souls and tongues untam'd  Fire up like Britons when the battle's nam'd  Each female heart pants for the glorious strife  From Hamlet's  Mrs Pritchard  mother to the Cobler's wife  Mrs Clive  Some few there are whom paltry passions guide  Desert each day and sly from side to side  Others like Swiss love fighting as their trade  For beat or beatingthey must all be paid  Sacred to SHAKESPEARE was this spot design'd  To pierce the heart and humanize the mind  But if an empty House the Actor's curse  Shews us our Lears and Hamlets lose their force  Unwilling we must change the nobler scene  And in our turn present you Harlequin  Quit Poets and set Carpenters to work  Shew gaudy scenes or mount the vaulting Turk  For tho' we Actors one and all agree  Boldly to struggle for ourvanity  If want comes on importance must retreat  Our first great ruling passion isto eat  To keep the field all methods we'll pursue  The conflict glorious for we fight for you  And should we fail to gain the wish'd applause  At least we're vanquish'd in a noble cause  XII An OCCASIONAL EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs CLIVE at DruryLane Theatre October  Enters hastily as if speaking to one who would oppose her  I'LL do't by heav'n I willpray get you gone  What all these janglings and I not make one  Was ever woman offer'd so much wrong  These creatures here would have me hold my tongue  I'm so provok'dI hope you will excuse me  I must be heardand beg you won't refuse me  While our mock heroes not so wise as rash  With indignation hold the vengeful lash  And at each other throw alternate squibs  Compos'd of little witand some few fibs  I Catherine Clive come here t' attack 'em all  And aim alike at  little  Mr Garrick  and at  tall  Mr Barry    But first ere with the buskin chiefs I brave it  A story is at hand and you shall have it  Once on a time two boys were throwing dirt  A gentle youth was one and one was somewhat pert  Each to his master with his tale retreated  Who gravely heard their diff'rent parts repeated  How Tom was rude and Jack poor lad illtreated  The master paus'dto be unjust was loth  Call'd for a rod and fairly whipt them both  In the same master's place lo here I stand  And for each culprit hold the lash in hand  First for our ownoh 'tis a pretty youth  But out of fifty lies I'll sift some truth  'Tis true he's of a choleric disposition  And fiery parts make up his composition  How have I seen him rave when things miscarried  Indeed he's grown much tamer since he married  If he succeeds what joys his fancy strike  And then he GETSto which he's no dislike  Faults he has manybut I know no crimes  Yes he has onehe contradicts sometimes  And when he falls into his frantick fit  He blusters so he makes e'en ME submit  So much for himThe other youth comes next  Who shews by what he says poor soul he's vext  He tells you tales how cruelly THIS treats us  To make you think the little monster beats us  Would I have whin'd in melancholy phrase  A line in the Prologue spoken at CoventGarden by Mr Barry  How bouncing Bajazet retreats from Bayes  I who am woman would have stood the fray  At least not snivell'd thus and run away  Should any Manager lift arm at me  I have a tyrant arm as well as he  In fact there has some little bouncing been  But who the bouncer was enquire within  No matter who I now proclaim a peace  And hope henceforth hostilities will cease  No more shall either rack his brains to tease ye  But let the contest bewho most shall please ye  XIII EPILOGUE to GIL BLAS  A Comedy by Mr Moore acted at DruryLane February    Spoken by Mrs PRITCHARD  AS the success of Authors is uncertain  Till all is over and down drops the curtain  Poets are puzzled in our dangerous times  How to address you in their afterrhymes  If they implore and beg with abject mind  Their meaness rather makes you sick than kind  And if they bounce and huff it to the town  Then you are upand take the bullies down  Of beaux and politicks and such like stuff  And e'en of tawdry too you've had enough  On all degrees from courtier to the cit  Such stale dull jokes have been so often writ  That nothing can be newbut decency and wit  Thus far our bardThe rest is mine to say  I am his friend so will attack his play  How could his thoughtless head with any truth  If Spanish Dons are like our English youth  Make his wild rake so sink from upper life  To quit his mistress for a lawful wife  The Author might have married himbut then  He should have had his mistress back again  This is the scheme our English Dons pursue  Tho' one's too much there's taste in having two  As for the lady I dislike her plan  With you I'm sure she had not pass'd for man  Had she with our young bloods contriv'd this freak  She had been blown and ruin'd in a week  And if of virtue they could not have trick'd her  They'd damn'd her for a foolperhaps have kick'd her  But jest apartfor all our bard has wrote  Our most alluring bait's the petticoat  Before that magick shrine the proudest fall  'Tis that enchanting circle draws in all  Let fools say what they will experience teaches  'Tis best to marry firstthen wear the breeches  XIV PROLOGUE to TASTE  A Comedy in Two Acts by Mr Foote acted at DruryLane January

learned bawling brothers  With much humility and fear implore ye  To lay our present desp'rate case before ye  'Tis said this night a certain wag intends  To laugh at us our calling and our friends  If lords and ladies and such dainty folks  Are cur'd of auctionhunting by his jokes  Should this odd doctrine spread throughout the land  Before you buy be sure to understand  Oh think on us what various ills will flow  When great ones only purchasewhat they know  Why laugh at TASTE It is a harmless fashion  And quite subdues each detrimental passion  The fair one's hearts will ne'er incline to man  While thus they rage forchina and japan  The Virtuoso too and Connoisseur  Are ever decent delicate and pure  The smallest hair their looser thoughts might hold  Just warm when singleand when married cold  Their blood at sight of beauty gently flows  Their Venus must be old and want a nose  No am'rous passion with deep knowledge thrives  'Tis the complaint indeed of all our wives  'Tis said  Virtû  to such a height is grown  All artists are encourag'dbut our own  Be not deceiv'd I here declare on oath  I never yet sold goods of  foreign  growth  Ne'er sent commissions out to Greece or Rome  My best antiquities are made at home  I've Romans Greeks Italians near at hand  True Britons alland living in the Strand  I ne'er for trinkets rack my pericranium  They furnish out my room from Herculaneum  But hush  Should it be known that English are employ'd  Our manufacture is at once destroy'd  No matter what our countrymen deserve  They'll thrive as antients but as moderns starve  If we should fall to you it will be owing  Farewel to Artsthey're going going going  The fatal hammer's in your hand oh Town  Then set Us upand knock the POET down  No XV PROLOGUE to EUGENIA  A Tragedy by Dr Francis acted at Drurylane February    Spoken by Mr GARRICK  TO damn or notthat is the question now  Whether 'tis best to deck the Poet's brow  With hands and hearts unanimous befriend him  Or take up arms and by opposing end him  But hold before you give the fatal word  I beg that I as counsel may be heard  And what few counsel ever yet have done  I'll take no bribe and yet plead  pro  and  con  First for the town and usI see some danger  Should you too kindly treat this reverend stranger  If such good folks these wits of graver sort  Should here usurp a right to spoil your sport  And curb our stage so wanton bold and free  To the strict limits of their purity  Should dare in theatres reform abuses  And turn our actresses to pious uses  Farewel the joyous spiritstirring scene  Farewel thetheyou guess the thing I mean  If this wise scheme so sober and so new  Should pass with us would it go down with you  Should we so often see your wellknown faces  Or would the ladies send so fast for places  Now for the AuthorHis poetick brat  Throughout the town occasions various chat  What say the snarlers'tis a French translation  That we deny but plead an imitation  Eugenia  was little more than a free translation of a French Comedy called  Cenia    Such as we hope will please a freeborn nation  His muse tho' much too grave to dress or dance  For some materials took a trip to France  She owns the debt nor thinks she shall appear  Like our spruce youths the worse for going there  Tho' she has dealt before in sportive song  This is her first stageflight and 'twould be wrong  Nay poaching too to kill your bards too young  Poets like foxes make best sport when old  The chace is good when both are hard and bold  Do you like other sportsmen then take heed  If you destroy the whelps you spoil the breed  Let him write on acquire some little fame  Then hunt him criticks he'll be noble game  XVI PROLOGUE to the GAMESTER  A Tragedy by Mr Moore acted at Drurylane January    Spoken by Mr GARRICK  LIKE fam'd La Mancha's knight who launce in hand  Mounted his steed to free th' enchanted land  Our Quixote bard sets forth a monstertaming  Arm'd at all points to fight that hydra  gaming  Aloft on Pegasus he waves his pen  And hurls defiance at the caitiff's den  The first on fancy'd giants spent his rage  But this has more than windmills to engage  He combats passion rooted in the soul  Whose powers at once delight ye and controul  Whose magic bondage each lost slave enjoys  Nor wishes freedom tho' the spell destroys  To save our land from this magician's charms  And rescue maids and matrons from his arms  Our knight poetic comesAnd oh ye fair  This black  enchanter's  wicked arts beware  His subtle poison dims the brightest eyes  And at his touch each grace and beauty dies  Love gentleness and joy to rage give way  And the soft dove becomes a bird of prey  May this our bold advent'rer break the spell  And drive the daemon to his native hell  Ye slaves of passion and ye dupes of France  Wake all your pow'rs from this destructive trance  Shake off the shackles of this tyrant vice  Hear other calls than those of cards and dice  Be learn'd in nobler arts than arts of play  And other debts than those of honour pay  No longer live insensible to shame  Lost to your country families and same  Could our romantic muse this work atchieve  Would there one honest heart in Britain grieve  T  ' attempt tho' wild would not in vain be made  If ev'ry honest hand would lend its aid  XVII PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr FOOTE at Drurylane Theatre October  THE many various objects that amuse  These busy curious times by way of news  Are plays elections murders lott'ries Jews  All these compounded fly throughout the nation  And set the

Squires  Elizabeth Canning who at this time engaged the attention of the publick by a story of a pretended robbery by Mary Squires a Gipsey    In like extremes your laughing humour flows  Have ye not roar'd from Pit to Upper Rows  And all the jest was whata fidler's nose  The person here meant is Mons Cervetti who has been a standing joke with the upper gallery for a long time pail on account of the length of his nose but as I am informed no feature of his mind is out of proportion unless it be that his good qualities are extraordinary I take this opportunity to mention that it is cruel to render him uneasy in the business in which he is eminert and in which he must get a livelihood    Pursue your mirth each night the jest grows stronger  For as you fret the  man  his nose looks longer  Among the trifles which occasion prate  Ev'n I sometimes am matter of debate  Whene'er my faults or follies are the question  Each draws his wit out and begins dissection  Sir  Peter Primrose  smirking o'er his tea  Sinks from himself and politics to me  Papers boyhere Sir  Tam  what news today  Foote sir is advertis'dwhat run away  No sir he acts this week at Drurylane  How's that cries  Feeble Grub  Foote come again  I thought this fool had done his devil's dance  Was not he hang'd some months ago in France  Upstarts  Machone  and thus the room harangu'd  'Tis true his friends gave

A Tragedy by Mr Crisp acted at Drurylane February    Spoken by Mr GARRICK  PROLOGUES like compliments are loss of time  'Tis penning bows and making legs in rhime  'Tis cringing at the door with

ladylike with flattery pursu'd  They nauseate fellows that are blunt and rude  Authors should learn to dance as well as write  Dance at my time of life Zounds what a sight  Grown Gentlemen 'tis

 XIX EPILOGUE to the same PLAY  Spoken by Mrs CIBBER  THE poet's pen can like a conjurer's wand  Or kill or raise his heroine at command  And I shall spiritlike before I sink  Not courteously  enquire

eyes applaud Virginia's 'scape  And vow they'd do the same to shun a rape  So very chaste they live in constant fears  And apprehension strengthens with their years  Ye bucks who from the pit your terrors send  Yet love distressed damsels to befriend  You think this tragic joke too far was carried  And wish to set all right the maid had married  You'd rather see if so the fates had will'd  Ten wives be kind than one poor virgin kill'd  May I approach unto the  boxes  pray  And there search out a judgment on the play  In vain alas I should attempt to find it  Fine ladies  see  a play but never  mind it    'Tis vulgar to be mov'd by  acted  passion  Or form opinions 'till they're fix'd by fashion  Our author hopes this fickle goddess  mode  With us will make at least nine days abode

We'll mend that fault whenever you shall chuse it  Our last mischance and worse than all the rest  Which turns the whole performance to a jest  OUR singers are all well and all will do their best  But why should this rash fool this Englishman  Attempt an op'ra'tis the strangest plan  Struck with the wonders of his master's art  Mr Smith was a pupil of Handell and afterwards his successor in the management of the Oratorios    Whose sacred dramas shake and melt the heart  Whose heav'nborn strains the coldest breast inspire  Whose chorusthunder sets the soul on fire  Inflam'd astonish'd at those magic airs  When Sampson groans and frantic Saul despairs  The pupil wrotehis work is now before ye  And waits your stamp of infamy or glory  Yet ere his errors and his faults are known  He says

Nor nip mein the buddings of my sin  Some hopes I cherish in your smiles I read 'em  What'er my faults your candour can exceed 'em  XXV PROLOGUE to FLORIZEL and PERDITA  A Dramatick Pastoral altered by Mr Garrick and acted at DruryLane January  Spoken by Mr GARRICK  TO various things the stage has been compar'd  As apt ideas strike each humorous bard  This night for want of better simile  Let this our theatre a tavern be  The poets vintners and the waiters we  So as the cant and custom of the trade is  You're welcome Gem'men kindly welcome Ladies  To draw in customers our bills are spread  Shewing a playbill  You cannot miss the sign 'tis Shakespeare's Head  From this same head this fountainhead divine  For different palates springs a different wine  In which no tricks to strengthen or to thin 'em  Neat as importedno French brandy in 'em  Hence for the choicest spirits flows Champaign  Whose sparkling atoms shoot thro' ev'ry vein  Then mount in magic vapours to th' enraptur'd brain  Hence flow for martial minds potations strong  And sweet love potions for the fair and young  For you my hearts of oak for your regale  To the Upper Gallery  There's good old English stingo mild and stale  For high luxurious souls with luscious smack  There's Sir John Falstaff is a butt of sack  And if the stronger liquors more invite ye  Bardolph is gin and Pistol aquavitae  But should you call for Falstaff where to find him  Mr Quin had then left the stage  He's gonenor left one cup of sack behind him  Sunk in his elbowchair no more he'll roam  No more with merry wags to Eastcheap come  He's goneto jest and laugh and give his sack at home  As for the learned Critics brave and deep  Who catch at words and catching fall asleep  Who in the storms of passionhum and haw  For such our master will no liquor draw  So blindly thoughtful and so darkly read  They take Tom Durfey's for the Shakespeare's Head  A vintner once acquir'd both praise and gain  And sold much Perry for the best Champaign  Some rakes this precious stuff did so allure  They drank whole nights What's that when wine is pure  ' Come fill a bumper JackI will my Lord  ' Here's creamdamn'd fineimmenseupon my word  ' Sir William what say youThe best believe me  ' In thisEh Jackthe Devil can't deceive me'  Thus the wise Critic too mistakes his wine  Cries out with lifted eyes'Tis great divine  Then jogs his neighbour as the wonders strike him  This Shakespeare Shakespeare Oh there's nothing like him  In this night's various and enchanted cup  Some little Perry's mixt for filling up  The five long acts from which our three are taken  Stretch'd out to  The action of the Winter's Tale as written by Shakespeare comprehends sixteen years  sixteen years lay by forsaken  Lest then this precious liquor run to waste  'Tis now confin'd and bottled for your taste  'Tis my chief wish my joy my only plan  To lose no drop of that immortal man  XXVI A DIALOGUE Between an  Actor  and a  Critick  By way of PROLOGUE to the TEMPEST  An Opera by Mr Garrick acted at Drurylane Feb    Heartly the Actor  Mr HAVARD  Wormwood the Critic  Mr YATES  Wormwood  and  Heartly  Worm  I say it is a shame Mr Heartly and I am amazed that you let your goodnature talk thus against the conviction of your understanding  Heart  You won't let me talk sir if you would but have patience and hear reason a little  Worm  I wish I could sir but you put me out of all patience by having no reason to give me I say that this frittering and sol faing our best poets is a damn'd thing I have yet heard no reason to justify it and I have no patience when I think of it  Heart  I see you have not  Worm  What are we to be quivered and quavered out of our senses Give me Shakespeare in all his force vigour and spirit What would you make an eunuch of him No  Shakesporelli's  for my money  Heart  Nay but dear sir hear me in my turn or the truth for which we are or ought to be so warmly fighting will  slip thro' our fingers  Worm  Will you hold it when you have it I say Mr Heartly while you let your goodnature  Heart  And I say Mr Wormwood while you are to be influenced and blown up by paragraphs in newspapers and insinuations in coffeehouses we can never come to a fair debate They who write upon all subjects without understanding any or will talk about musick without ears or taste for it are but very indifferent judges in our dispute  Worm  Well come on Mr  Solfa  thenLet you and I fight it out or to speak in the musical phrase let us have a  Duette  together I'll clear up my pipes and have at youHem hem  Heart  With all my heart tho' I'm afraid you'll make it a  Solo  for you have not yet suffered the second part to come in  Worm  Ho play away sirI'll be dumb  Heart  Let us calmly consider this complaint of your's If it is well founded I will submit with pleasure if not you will  Worm  Not submit with pleasure I assure you I never do  Heart  You will at least have this satisfaction that the sentence which will be given whether for or against you will be as indisputable as it will be just  Worm  I don't know what you mean Nothing's indisputable that I please to contradict and nothing's just that I please to call in question  Heart  Look round  upon  the court and if you can reasonably except against any one of the jury I will give up the cause before trial  Worm  O ho what you are bribing the court beforehand with your flattery are you  Heart  There you are out again our countrymen in a body are no more to be  flatter'd  than  bully'd  which I hope their enemies who can do both will be convinced of before they have done with them But I wander from the question To the point sir what are your objections to this night's entertainment  Worm  I hate an Opera  Heart  I dislike tyewigs but should I throw your's into the fire because I chuse to wear a bag  Worm  Woe be to your bag if you did  Heart  You hate musick perhaps  Worm  Damnably and dancing too  Heart  But why pray  Worm  They pervert nature Legs are made for walking tongues for speaking and therefore capering and quavering are unnatural and abominable  Heart  You like Shakespeare  Worm  Like him adore him worship him There's no capering and quavering in his works  Heart  Have a care  " The man that has no musick in himself  " Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds  " Is fit for treason stratagems and spoils  " The motions of his spirit are dull as night  " And his affections dark as Erebus  " Let no such man be trusted"  Worm  Fit for treason dull as night not to be trustedso you have proved me both a fool and a rebelDon't provoke me Mr Heartly Shakespeare never wrote such stuff as that 'tis foisted in by some fiddler or other  Heart  You pay the fiddlers as you call them a very great compliment  Worm  Did I I am sorry for it I did not mean it were I to pay 'emcrabstick's the word  Heart  For shame Mr Wormwood Let me ask you a question would you chuse that  your country should be excelled in any thing by your neighbours  Worm  In manufacturesnofrom the casting of cannon to the making of pins from the weaving of velvets to the making of hopsacks but your capering and quavering only spoil us and make  us  the jests who  should  be the terrors of Europe  Heart  But English musick Mr Wormwood  Worm  English musick or any musick enervates the body weakens the mind and lessens the courage  Heart  Quite the contrary  Worm  Prove that and I'll learn the gamut immediately nay bespeak me a pair of pumps and I'll make one at the dancing academy for grown gentlemen  Heart  Let us suppose an invasion  Worm  Ha ha ha an invasionmusick and an invasion they are well coupled truly  Heart  Patience sirI say let us suppose ten thousand French landed  Worm  I had rather suppose 'em at the bottom of the sea  Heart  So had Ibut that ten thousand are upon the coast  Worm  The devil they are What then  Heart  Why then I say let but  Britons strike home  or  God save the king  be sounded in the ears of five thousand brave Englishmen  with a protestant prince at the head of 'em and they'll drive every monsieur into the sea and make 'em food for sprats and mackarel  Worm  Huzza and so they will'Egad you're right I'll say no more  Britons strike home  You have warm'd me and pleas'd me nay you have converted me I'll get a place in the house and be as hearty as the best of 'em for the musick of Old England Sprats and mackarel ha ha ha that's good excellent I thank you for it musick for ever  Britons strike home God save the King  Heart  The last thing I have to say will touch you as nearly Mr Wormwood  Worm  You have touch'd me enough already say no more I am satisfy'd I shall never forget sprats and mackarel  Heart  We may boast sincerely boast of many excellent English composers and would not you permit your countrymen to have the same encouragement as foreigners  Worm  Encouragement why I'll encourage them myself man  Heart  Where can they shew their talents unless upon the English stages and if the managers of them will not give up a few nights to encourage English musick our musical countrymen Mr Wormwood would be of the number of those persons of merit who are undeservedly neglected in this kingdom  Worm  But they shan't I'll support 'em I'll never more hearken to your clubspeeches and your dissertations and newspaper essays I see my error but I'll make amends Let us meet after it is over and take a bottle to sprats and mackarel eh master Heartly at the Shakespeare I'll be with you  Britons strike home    Exit singing  Heart  Ha ha ha Mr Wormwood is now as much too violent in his zeal as he was before in his prejudice We expect not ladies and gentlemen that this night's performance should meet with success merely because it is English You would be as incapable of conceiving as we of urging such false and contracted notions yet on the other hand let not our musical brethren be cast off because fashion caprice or manners too refin'd may have given you prejudices against them  Musick is the younger sister of poetry and can boast her charms and accomplishments Suffer not the younger then to be turned out of doors while the elder is so warmly and deservedly cherished  If worthy you'll protect her tho' distrest  'Tis the known maxim of a British breast  Those to befriend the most who're most opprest  XXVII EPILOGUE to ATHELSTAN  A Tragedy by Dr Brown acted at Drurylane Feb    Spoken by Mrs CIBBER  TO speak ten words again I've fetch'd my breath  The tongue of woman struggles hard with death  Ten words will that suffice ten wordsno more  We always give a thousand to the score  What can provoke these wits their time to waste  To please that fickle fleeting thing call'd taste  It mocks all search for substance has it none  Like Hamlet's ghost'Tis here'Tis there'Tis gone  How very few about the stage agree  As men with different eyes a beauty see  So judge they of that stately dameQueen Tragedy  The Greekread critic as his mistress holds her  And having little love for trifles scolds her  Excuses want of spirit beauty grace  But ne'er forgives her failing time and place  How do our sex of taste and judgment vary  Miss 'Bell adores what's loath'd by lady Mary  The first in tenderness a very dove  Melts like the feather'd snow at Juliet's love  Then sighing turns to Romeo by her side  " Can you believe that men for love have dy'd"  Her ladyship who vaults the courser's back  Leaps the barr'd gate and calls you Tom and Jack  Detests these whinings like a true virago  She's all for daggers blood blood blood Iago  A third whose heart defies all perturbations  Yet dies for triumphs funerals coronations  Ne'er asks which tragedies succeed or fail  But whose procession has the longest tail  The youths to whom France gives a new belief  Who look with horror on a rump of beef  On Shakespeare's plays with shrugg'dup shoulders stare  These plays They're bloody murders  O barbare  And yet the man has merit  Entre nous  He'd been damn'd clever had he read  Bossû  Shakespeare read French roars out a surly cit  When Shakespeare wrote our valour match'd our wit  Had Britons then been fops queen Bess had hang'd 'em  Those days they never read the Frenchthey bang'd 'em  If taste evaporates by too high breeding  And eke is overlaid by too deep reading  Left then in search of this you lose your feeling  And barter native sense in foreign dealing  Be this neglected truth to Britons known  No tastes no modes become you but your own  XXVIII PROLOGUE to LILLIPUT  A Farce by Mr Garrick acted at Drurylane December    Spoken by Mr WOODWARD  BEHOLD a conjurorthat's something new  For as times go my brethren are but few  I'm come with magic ring and taper wand  To waft you far from this your native land

And gentlemenfor shamedon't screw your faces  Softly my imps and fiendsyou critics there  Pray you sit still or I can never steer  My devils are not the devils you need to fear  Hold fast my friends above for faith we spin it  My usual rate's a thousand miles a minute  A statesman now could tell how high we soar  Statesmen have been these airy jaunts before  I see the landthe folkswhat limbs what features  There's lords and ladies toothe pretty creatures  Now to your sight these puppets I'll produce  Which may if rightly heeded turn to use  Puppets not made of wood and play'd with wires  But flesh and blood and full of strange desires  So strange you'll scarce believe me should I tell  For giant vices may in pigmies dwell  Beware you lay not to the conj'ror's charge  That these in miniature are you in large  To you these little folks have no relation  As diff'rent in their manners as their nation  To shew your pranks requires no conjuration  Open your ears and eyesyour mouths be shut  England is vanish'd  waves his wand  Enter Lilliput    Strikes the curtain and sinks  XXIX PROLOGUE to the MALECOQUETTE  A Farce by Mr Garrick acted at Mr Woodward's Benefit Drurylane March  Or  Spoken by Mr GARRICK  WHY to this farce this title giv'n  Of  Seventeen hundred fiftyseven  Is it a register of fashions  Of follies frailties fav'rite passions  Or is't design'd to make appear  How happy good and wise you were  In this same  memorable  year  Sure with our author wit was scarce  To crowd so many virtues in a farce  Perhaps 'tis made to make you stare  Like cloths hung out at country fair  On which strange monsters glare and grin  To draw the gaping bumpkins in  Tho' 'tis the genius of the age  To catch the eye with titlepage  Yet here we dare not so abuse ye  We have some monsters to amuse ye  Ye slaves to fashion dupes of chance  Whom fortune leads her fickle dance  Who as the dice shall smile or frown  Are rich and poor and up and down  Whose minds eternal vigils keep  Who like Macbeth have murder'd sleep  Each modish vice this night shall rise  Like Banquo's ghost before your eyes  While conscious you shall start and roar  Hence horrid farce we'll see no more  Ye ladies too maids widows wives  Now tremble for your naughty lives  How will your hearts go pitapat  " Bless meLordwhat's the fellow at  " Was poet e'er so rude before  " Why sure the brute will say no more  " AgainO Gad I cannot bear  " Hereyou boxkeepercall my chair"  Peace ladies 'tis a false alarm  To you our author means no harm  His female failings all are fictions  To which your lives are contradictions  Th' unnat'ral fool has drawn a plan  Where women like a worthless man  A fault ne'er heard of since the world began  This year he lets you steal away  But if the next you trip or stray  His muse he vows on you shall wait  In Seventeen hundred fiftyeight  XXX PROLOGUE to the GAMESTERS  A Comedy altered from Shirley by Mr Garrick and acted at Drurylane December    Spoken by Mr GARRICK  WHENE'ER the wits of France take pen in hand  To give a sketch of you and this our land  One settled maxim thro' the whole you see  To wit their great superiority  Urge what you will they still have this to say  That you who ape them are less wise than they  'Tis thus these wellbred letterwriters use us  They trip o'er here with half an eye peruse us  Embrace us eat our meat and thenabuse us  When this same play was writ that's now before ye  The English stage had reach'd its point of glory  No paltry thefts disgrac'd this author's pen  He painted English manners Englishmen  And form'd his taste on Shakespeare and Old Ben  Then were French fashions farces quite unknown  Our wits wrote well and all they writ their own  These were the times when no infatuation  No vicious modes no zeal for imitation  Had chang'd deform'd and sunk the British Nation  Should you be ever from yourselves estrang'd  The cock will crow to see the lion chang'd  To boast our liberty is weak and vain  While tyrant vices in our bosoms reign  Not liberty alone a nation saves  Corrupted freemen are the worst of slaves  Let Prussia's sons each English breast inflame  O be our spirit as our cause the same  And as our hearts with one Religion glow  Let us with all their ardour drive the foe  As heav'n had rais'd our arm as heav'n had giv'n the blow  Would you rekindle all your antient fires  Extinguish first your modern vain desires  Still it is yours your glories to retrieve  Lop but the branches and the tree shall live  With these erect a pile for sacrifice  And in the midstthrow all your cards and dice  Then fire the heap and as it sinks to earth  The British Genius shall have second birth  Shall Phoenixlike rise perfect from the flame  Spring from the dust and mount again to fame  XXXI Part of a PROLOGUE to HARLEQUIN's INVASION  A Pantomime by Mr Garrick acted at Drurylane December    Spoken by Mr KING  BUT why a speaking Harlequin'tis wrong  The wits will say to give the fool a tongue  When Lun  The name assumed by Mr Rich when he performed Harlequin  appear'd with matchless art and whim  He gave the pow'r of speech to ev'ry limb  Tho' mask'd and mute convey'd his quick intent  And told in frolic gestures all he meant  But now the motley coat and sword of wood  Requires a tongue to make them understood  XXXII PROLOGUE to the DESART ISLAND  A Dramatic Poem by Mr Murphy acted at Drurylane January    Spoken by Mr GARRICK in the Character of a Drunken Poet  ALL all shall outall that I know and feel  I will by heav'nto higher powers appeal  No nothey can't say

woman near me  And this I sacrifice to give you pleasure  For you I've coin'd my brainsand here's the treasure    Pulls out a manuscript  A treasure this of profit and delight  And all thrown by for this damn'd stuff tonight  This is a play would water ev'ry eye  If I but look upon't it makes me cry  This play would tears from bloodstain'd soldiers draw  And melt the bowels of hardhearted law  Would fore and aft the stormproof sailor rake  Keep turtleeating aldermen awake  Would the cold blood of ancient maidens thrill  And make ev'n pretty younger tongues lie still  This play not ev'n managers would refuse  Had heaven but giv'n 'em any brains to chuse    Puts up his manuscript  Your hard tonight bred in the ancient school  Designs and measures all by critic rule  'Mongst friendsit

But all your fine poetic prittle prattle  The plot is thisA lady's cast away  Long before the beginning of the play  And they are taken by a fisherman  The lady and the child'tis Bayes's plan  So on

own tongue your gratitude can tell  " A little flattery sometimes does well"  XXXIII Conclusion to the PROLOGUE to POLLY HONEYCOMBE  A Dramatick Novel by Mr Colman acted at DruryLane December    Spoken by Mr KING  These lines were written by Mr Garrick and added on its being reported that he was the Author of the Piece a report which he modestly supposed might be prejudicial to its success    THUS of our Polly having lightly spoke  Now for our Author but without a joke  Tho' wits and journals who ne'er fibb'd before  Have laid this bantling  at a certain door  Where laying store of faults they'd fain heap more  I now declare it as a serious truth  'Tis the first folly of a simple youth  Caught and deluded by our harlot plays  Then crush not in the shell this infant  Bayes  Exert your favour to a young beginner  Nor use the strippling like a batter'd sinner  XXXIV EPILOGUE to POLLY HONEYCOMBE  Spoken by Miss POPE  Enter as POLLY laughingHa ha ha  MY poor Papa's in woeful agitation  While I the cause feel here    striking her bosom    no palpitation  We girls of reading and superior notions  Who from the fountainhead drink love's sweet potions  Pity our parents when such passion blinds 'em  One hears the good folks raveOne never minds 'em  Till these dear books infus'd their soft ingredients  Asham'd and fearful I was all obedience  Then my good father did not storm in vain  I blush'd and cry'd  I'll ne'er do so again  But now no bugbears can my spirit tame  I've conquer'd fearand almost conquer'd shame  So much these dear instructors change and win us  Without their  light  we ne'er should know what's in us  Here we at once supply our childish wants  Novels  are hotbeds for your forward plants  Not only sentiments refine the soul  But hence we learn to be the Smart and Drole  Each awkward circumstance for laughter serves  From nurse's nonsense to my mother's nerves  Tho' parents tell us that our genius lies  In mending linnen and in making pies  I set such formal precepts at defiance  That preach up prudence neatness and compliance  Leap these old bounds and boldly set the pattern  To be a Wit Philosopher and Slattern  O did all maids and wives my spirit feel  We'd make this topsyturvy world to reel  Let us to arms our fathers husbands dare  Novels will teach us all the art of war  Our tongues will serve for trumpet and for drum  I'll be your leaderGeneral  Honeycombe  Too long has human nature gone astray  Daughters should govern Parents should obey  Man should submit the moment that he weds  And hearts of oak should yield to wiser heads  I see you smile bold Britons but 'tis true  Beat you the Frenchbut let your wives beat you  XXXV PROLOGUE to the EARL of ESSEX  A Tragedy by Henry Brooke  Esq  acted at Drurylane January    Spoken by Mrs PRITCHARD in the Character of Queen Elizabeth  If any here are Britons but in name  Dead to their country's happiness and fame  Let 'em depart this momentlet 'em fly  My awful presence and my searching eye  No more your Queen but upright judge I come  To try your deeds abroad your lives at home  Try you in ev'ry point from small to great  Your wit laws fashions valour church and state  Search you as Britons ne'er were search'd before  O tremble for you hear the lion roar  Since that most glorious time that here I reign'd  An age and halfwhat have you lost or gain'd  Your wit whate'er your poets sing or swear  Since Shakespeare's time is somewhat worse for wear  Your laws are good your lawyers good of course  The streams are surely clear when clear the source  In greater store these blessings now are sent ye  Where I had one attorney you have twenty  Fa hions ye fair deserve nor praise nor b'ame  Unless they rise as foes to sense or shame  Wear ruffs or gauze but let your skill be such  Rather to shew too little than too much  As for your valourhere my lips I close  Let those who best have prov'd itspeakyour foes  Your morals church and state are still behind  But softprophetic fury fills my mind  I see thro' timebehold a youthful hand  It should be remembered that this Epilogue was spoken just after the accession of his present Majesty    Holding the sceptre of this happy land  Whose heart with justice love and virtue fraught  Born amongst Britons and by Britons taught  Shall make the barking tongues of faction cease  And weave the garland of domestic peace  Long shall he reignno storms to beat his breast  Unruly passions that disturb'd my rest  Shall live the blessings he bestows to share  Reap all my glory but without my care  XXXVI EPILOGUE to EDGAR and EMMELINE  A Fairy Tale by Dr Hawkesworth acted at Drurylane January    Spoken by Mrs YATES  OLD times old fashions and the fairies gone  Let us return good folks to sixtyone  To this blest time ye fair of female glory  When pleasures unforbidden lie before ye  No sp'rits to fright you now no guardian elves  Your wise directors areyour own dear selves  And every fair one feels from old to young  While these your guidesyou never can do wrong  Weak were the sex of yore their pleasures few  How much more wise more spirited are you  Would any Lady Jane or Lady Mary  Ere they did this or that consult a fairy  Would they permit this saucy pigmy crew  For each small slip to pinch 'em black and blue  Well may you shudder for with all your charms  Were this the case good heav'n what necks and arms  Thus did they serve our grandames heretofore  The very thought must make us moderns sore  Did their poor hearts for cards and dancing beat  These elves rais'd blisters on their hands and feet  Though Loo the game and fiddles play'd most sweetly  They could not squeeze dear Pam nor foot Moll Peatly  Were wives with husbands but a little wilful  Were they at that same Loo a little skilful  Did they with pretty fellows laugh or sport  Wear ruffs too small or petticoats too short  Did they no matter how disturb their cloaths  Or overlillied add a little rose  These spiteful fairies rattled round their beds  And put strange frightful nonsense in their heads  Nay while the husband snor'd and prudish aunt  Had the fond wife but met the dear gallant  Tho' lock'd the door and all as still as night  Pop thro' the keyhole whips the fairy sprite  Trips round the room"my husband" madam cries  " The devilwhere" the frighted beau replies  Jumps thro' the windowshe calls out in vain  He cur'd of love and cool'd with drenching rain  Swears'dn him if he'll e'er intrigue again'  These were the tricks of old But all allow  No childish fears disturb our fair ones now  Ladies for all this trifling 'twould be best  To keep a little fairy in your breast  Not one that should with modern passions war  But just to tweak youwhen you go too far  XXXVII EPILOGUE to the ANDRIA  Acted at Hackney School  About the year    DAVUS speaks  'BUT why act plays'some formal Greybeard cries  I'll answer that who am not overwise  To learn their lessons and to play the fool  Are the two great concerns of boys at school  And our good masters prudently discerning  How much we lean to folly more than learning  Contriv'd these plays by which the veriest dunce  May learn his book and play the fool at once  For Greek and Latin we have small devotion  Terence himself goes down a sickly potion  But set us once to  act  him never fear us  Our qualms are gone 'tis you are sick who hear us  Ne'er may our actors when they quit the school  Tread the great stage of life to play the fool  No partial friends can there our faults conceal  Should we play characters we cannot feel  If we act laware judges  then are We  Like Justice blindas council we may see  Enough to know the colour of a fee  In PhysicPractice is our best adviser  The more we're puzzled we must seem the wiser  If war's our trade and we vain blust'ring young  Should Thrasolike fight battles with our tongue  Soon 'twould appear how ill these airs became us  The foe comes on  quid nunc quin redeamus  In short be what we may experience teaches  This truthOne deed is worth a thousand speeches  John Moody of Sir Wronghead well has told it  He can speak stawtly but he canna' hawld it  This for myself and schoolNow let me say  Why with these English rhimes we close our play  Ladies for you they're meantI feel to you  Small as I am that great respect is due  Quit of my Grecian servitude I crave  Still to be English Davusand your slave  To succour helpless damsels is my plan  If you should want me ladies I'm your man  Should stubborn age your tender hearts provoke  " I soften rocks and bend the knotted oak"  Or should false swains for other nymphs forsake ye  Stay a few years and I'll be proud to take ye  If in your smiles we approbation read  'Tis done alreadyI'm a man indeed  XXXVIII PROLOGUE  Spoken at

KING  XXXIX EPILOGUE to ALL IN THE WRONG  A Comedy by Mr Murphy acted at Drurylane June while that Theatre was under the management of himself and Mr Foote    Spoken by Mrs YATES  BLESS me this summer work is so fatiguing  And then our play's so bustling so intriguing  Such missing sighing scolding all together  These love affairs suit best in colder weather  At this warm time these writers should not treat you  With too much love and passionfor they heat you  Poets like weavers should with taste and reason  Adapt their various goods to every season  For the hot months the fanciful and slight  For mind and body something cool and light  Authors themselves indeed neglect this rule  Dress warm in summer and at Christmas cool  I told our author that these five act plays  Were rich brocades unfit for sultry days  Were you a cook said I would you prepare  Large hams and roasted surloins for your fare  Their very smoke would pall a city glutton  A tragedy would make you all unbutton  Both

  Spoken by Miss BRIDE  STRIPP'D of my tragic weeds and rais'd from death  In freedom's land again I draw my breath  Tho' late a Trojan ghost in Charon's ferry  I'm now an English girl alive and merry  Hey Presto I'm in Greece a maiden slain  Now stranger still a maid in Drurylane  No more by barb'rous men and laws confin'd  I claim my native rightto speak my mind  Tho' poring pedants should applaud this piece  Behold a championfoe profest of Greece  I throw my gauntlet to the critic race  Throws down her glove  Come forth bold GreciansMeet me face to face  Come forth ye men of learning at my call  Learning a little feeling's worth it all  And you of Taste and Fashion I defy  Throws down another glove  But holdyou hate the Greek as much as I  Then let us join our force and boldly speak  That English ev'ry thing surpasses Greek  Kill a young virgin to resist unable  Kill her like houselamb for a dead man's table  Well may you tremble ladies and look pale  Do you not shudder parents at this tale  You sacrifice a daughter now and then  To rich old wither'd halfdeparted men  With us there's no compulsive law that can  Make a live girl to wed a quite dead man  Had I been wedded to some ancient King  I mean a GrecianAncient's not the thing  Then had our bard made ample reparation  Then had you seen a Grecian Coronation  Sneer not ye critics at this rage for show  That honest hearts at Coronations glow  At this time the town was entertained with representations of the Coronation at both the Theatres    Nor snarl that our faint copies glad their eyes  When from the thing itself such blessings rise  XLI PROLOGUE upon PROLOGUES to The MUSICAL LADY  A Farce by Mr Colman acted at Drurylane March    Spoken by Mr KING  AN old trite proverb let me quote  As is your cloth so cut your coat  To suit our Author and his Farce  Short let me be for wit is scarce  Nor would I shew it had I any  The reasons why are strong and many  Should I have wit the piece have none  A flash in pan with empty gun  The piece is sure to be undone  A tavern with a gaudy sign  Whose bush is better than the wine  May cheat you onceWill that device  Neat as imported  cheat you twice  'Tis wrong to raise your expectations  Poets be dull in dedications  Dulness in these to wit prefer  But there indeed you seldom err  In prologues prefaces be flat  A silver button spoils your hat  A threadbare coat might jokes escape  Did not the blockheads lace the cape  A case in point to this before ye  Allow me pray to tell a story  To turn the penny once a wit  Upon a curious fancy hit  Hung out a board on which he boasted  Dinner for Threepence Boil'd and roasted  The hungry read and in they trip  With eager eye and smacking lip  " Here bring this boil'd and roasted pray"  Enter  Potatoes  dress'd  each way  All star'd and rose the house forsook  And damn'd the dinnerkick'd the cook  My landlord sound poor  Patrick Kelly  There was no joking with the belly  These facts laid down then thus I reason  Wit in a prologue's out of season  Yet still will you for jokes sit watching  Like Cocklane folks for Fanny's scratching  At this time the Publick was amused with the ridiculous imposition of the Cocklane Ghost    And here my simile's so fit  For Prologues are but Ghosts of wit  Which mean to shew their art and skill  And scratch you to their Author's will  In short for reasons great and small  'Tis better to have none at all  Prologues and Ghostsa paltry trade  So let them both at once be  laid  Say but the word give your commands  We'll tie OUR prologuemonger's hands  Confine these culprits  holding up his hands  bind 'em tight  Nor Girls can scratch nor Fools can write  THE FARMER'S RETURN FROM  LONDON  AN INTERLUDE  Acted at Drurylane

acted at Drurylane January    Spoken by Mrs CIBBER  LADIES and Gentlemen'tis so ill bred  We have no Epilogue because I'm dead  For he our bard with frenzyrolling eye  Swears you shan't laugh when he has made you cry  At which I gave his sleeve a gentle pull  Suppose they should not cry and should be dull  In such a case 'twould surely do no harm  A little lively nonsense taken warm  On critic stomachs delicate and queasy  'Twill ev'n make a heavy meal sit easy  The town hates Epiloguesit is not true  I answer'd that for youand youand you    To Pit Boxes and    st Gal  They call for Epilogues and hornpipes too    To the Upper Gal  Madam the critics sayto you they're civil  Here if they have 'em not they'll play the devil  Out of this house sir and to you alone  They'll smile cry bravo charmingHere they groan  A single critic will not frown look big  Harmless and pliant as a single twig  But crouded here they change and 'tis not odd  For twigs when bundled up become a rod  Critics to bards like beauties to each other  When teteatete their enmity they smother  " Kiss me my dearhow do you charming creature  " What shape what bloom what spirit in each feature  " You flatter me'pon honor noYou do  " My friendmyDear sincerely yoursadieu"  But when at routs the dear friends change their tone  I speak of foreign ladies not our own  Will you permit good firs these gloomy folk  To give all tragedy without one joke  They gravely tell us Tragedy's design'd  To purge the passions purify the mind  To which I say to strike those blockheads dumb  With physic always give a sugar plumb  I love these sugarplumbs in prose or rhimes  No one is merrier than myself sometimes  Yet I poor I with tears and constant moan  Am melted down almost to skin and bone  This night in sighs and sobs I drew my breath  Love marriage treason prison poison death  Were scarce sufficient to complete my fate  Two children were thrown in to make up weight  With all these sufferings is it not provoking  To be deny'd at last a little joking  If they will make new laws for mirth's sake break 'em  Roar out for Epilogues and let me speak 'em  XLIV ADDRESS to the TOWN  Spoken by Mr GARRICK  About March  in the Character of the Busy Body  SINCE my good friends tho' late are pleas'd at last  I bear with patience all my suff'rings past  To you who saw my suff'rings it is clear  I bought my secrets most confounded dear  To any gentleman not over nice  I'll sell 'em all again and at half price  This Address was spoken just after the dispute relating to the admission of persons into the Theatres at half prices had been finally settled    Would I had been among you for no doubt  You all have secrets could I find them out  Each has a secret fitted to his fancy  My friends above therehonest John and Nancy  How well their secrets with their passions suit  Hearts full of love and pockets full of fruit  Each jolly sailor thus his mistress grapples  They look and laugh and love andeat their apples  So good or wise this precious town is growing  There's scarce a secret here that's worth the knowing  Nay where a hungry mind expects a feast  'Mongst politiciansit will get the least  They promise muchseem fullstare nod and pout  But tap 'em and the devil a drop comes out  In short I'll give this busy business over  Where much is felt and little to discover  But should the ladies wish or want t' employ me  I should be proud and pleas'd if they would try me  To manage meetings or to slip a letter  There's no French millener can do it better  As for the gentlemanthe rake or beau  I would not give 'em thatfor all they know  Indeed for secrets there are none excel 'em  But then they make 'em and when made they tell 'em  There is one secret still remains behind  Which ever did and will distract my mind  I'd give up all for thatnay fix for ever  To find the secretto deserve your favour  XLV PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr LOVE on opening the new Theatre on RichmondGreen  th June    THE ship now launch'd with necessaries stor'd  Rigg'd mann'd well built and a rich freight on board  All ready tight and trim from head to poop  And  by commission  make a  royal sloop  May heav'n from tempests rocks and privateers  Preserve The Richmondgive her boys three cheers  three huzzas behind  Queen Mab our Shakespeare says and I believe him  In sleep haunts each vain mortal to deceive him  As in her hazle nut she lightly trips  By turns o'er eyes ears fingers nose and lips  Each quicken'd sense such sweet enchantment seizes  We hear see smell taste touchwhate'er she pleases  Look round this house and various proof you'll see  Strong glaring proofs that Mab has been with me  She caught me napping knew where I was vain  And tickled every fibre of my brain  Deep in my musing deep as I was able  Methought I saw her driving tow'rds my table  She whisk'd her chariot o'er my books and shelves  And at my standish stopp'd her tiny elves  What are you scribbling therequick let me see  Pohleave this nonsense and along with me  I grinning bow'd  Bright star of Lilliput  Shall I not crowd you in your bazle nut  She smil'd and shewing me a largesiz'd hamper  Get into this my friend and then we'll scamper  I for this frolick wanting quick digestion  Sent to my tongue posthaste another question  But crack she went before that I could ask it  She in her stageI Faltsaff in the basket  She wav'd her wand then burst in fits of laughter  To see me rowling bowling tumbling after  And I laugh'd too Could you of laughing fail  To see a Minnow towing of a whale  At last we rested on a hill hard by  With a sweet vale to feast the glutton eye  I'll shew you more  she said  to charm and move us  And to the gardens quick as thought she drove us  Then pointing to the shade  there there they are  Of this most happy isle the happiest pair  Oh may those virtuous raptures never cease  Nor public cares disturb their private peace  She sigh'dand like the lightning was she seen  To drive her chariot o'er this fav'rite green  Strait to this spotwhere she infus'd such things  Might turn the heads of twenty playhouse kings  But fear dispersing all my golden dream  And I just entering on this fairyscheme  With wild surprize I cast my eyes about  Delusion ends and now I wake to doubt  O may the dream be realiz'd by you  Your frowns or smiles can

 To the high court of critics Drurylane  Two ladies sisters women of condition  Have sent by me their  courier  a  petition  Who are these ladies should the curious ask  See their broad seal a dagger and a mask  Here  Brass  take this I answer to the name  Am at their call and for your service came  'Tis sign'd as you may plainly see  Thalia and Melpomene  Alias Tragedy and Comedy  Poor souls they're angry and to hint is treason  That angry ladies have not always reason  In classic language they complain of wrong  Which thus I change to mine the vulgar tongue  They set forth at large that their case is so sad  That poor Comedy weeps and that Tragedy's mad  That Op'ra their rival heretofore maid of honour  Has got to your hearts and has ta'en much upon her  That this foreign minx has engross'd all your favours  And fritter'd their passions and humour to quavers  That she walks cheek by jole and won't hold up her tail  So humbly they beg that you'll send her to jail  There strip her and whip her then send her away  And bound as in duty for ever they'll pray  My mistresses mettled so high in their blood  Would scratch poor Op'ra's eyes out if they could  Suppose your honours to avoid a fuss  And save the pulling caps adjust it thus  When Tragedy  has barrow'd up the soul  Flung'd deep her dagger or toss'd off her bowl  When grief rage murder strew the palace round  Musick should pour her balm into the wound  Or when the Comic Lass has shook your sides  That laughter swell'd so high burst out in tides  Then Musick with its sweet enchanting strain  Should to its banks lure back the tide again  But how shall we your various fancies bind  When ev'ry Briton has a diff'rent mind  Musick's a harlot thus Tom Surly spoke  Whose charms will bend our honest Hearts of Oak  What are the Romans now once brave and free  Nothing but  tweedledum  and  tweedledee  Read Shakspur cries his wife he'll blunt your satire  Who has not musick in his soul's  a traitor  Ev'n savage beasts are mov'd by musick's touch  And you my dear to be unmov'dis much  Mammy is right lisps Missyou're wrong my Daddy  I'd hear for ever sir  Through the Wood Laddie  A favourite song sung the preceding summer at Vauxhall by Miss Wright    How's this roars out a bard in tragic pride  This catgut p st comes on with mighty stride  In Musick's lulling magick we are bound  Like yawning spreads the epidemick sound  " For when one yawns by turns we yawn all round"  XLVII PROLOGUE to DAPHNE and AMINTOR  A Musical Farce by Isaac Bickerstaffe acted at Drurylane th October    Spoken by Mr POWELL  A SKILFUL cook this useful art will boast  To hash and mince as well as boil and roast  Our cook tonight has for your fare made bold  To hash a piece of ven'son that was cold  Daphne and Amintor is little more than Mrs Cibber's Oracle with the addition of songs    With fresh ingredients seasons high the stew  And hopes the guests will heartily fall to  Leaving the piece to answer for itself  We beg your favour for a little elf  Miss Wright afterwards Mrs Arne who performed Daphne She had before played one of the Fairies in Edgar and Emmeline    A young one and a good one yet no sinner  And though a female has no mischief in her  Tho' oft with syren song she charm'd your ears  She now has other hopes and other fears  She hopes not yet content with what is done  To find more ways into your hearts than one  A passion long she hid 'till out it broke  And thus with blushing diffidence she spoke  " What joys what raptures in my breast would spring  " Had I but leave to  act  as well as  sing  " Though young I am and difficult the trade is  " In time I'll do as much as other ladies"  Ye giant wits who run a tilt at all  Who spare nor sex nor age nor great nor small  Should you fell criticks like the French wild beast  At this time the newspapers were daily publishing extravagant accounts of the depredations of a wild beast in the neighbourhood of  Langagne  and the forest of  Mercoire  One of them describes the monster in the following manner  "It has already devoured twenty persons chiefly children and particularly young girls and scarcely a day passes without some accident The terror he occasions prevents the woodcutters from working in the forest so that wood is become dear Those who have seen him say he is much higher than a wolf low before and his feet are armed with talons His hair is reddish his head large long made and the muzzle of it shaped like that of a greyhound his ears small and strait his breast is wide and of a grey colour his back streaked with black and his mouth which is large is provided with a set of teeth so very sharp that they have taken off several heads as clean as a razor could have done He is of amazing swiftness but when he aims at his prey he crouches so close to the ground that he hardly appears to be bigger than a large fox and at the distance of one or two fathoms he rises upon his hind legs and springs upon his prey which he always seizes by the neck or throat He is afraid of oxen which he runs away from The consternation is universal throughout the district where he commits his ravages and publick prayers are offered up upon this occasion"    With gluttony refin'd on damsels feast  Spare ours awhilelet her some substance get  Plumpt high with fameshe's scarce a mouthful yet  Or would ye ladies strike these giants dumb  You can protect her from their  feefawfum  Though humble now how soon would she be vain  Should you but cry  Bravowe'll come again  To raise your smiles were it her happy lot  For smiles are honest when the hands are not  Should you our little songstress kindly treat  With gratitude her little heart would beat  What raptures for a female and so young  To have a double right to use her tongue  XLVIII PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr GARRICK before Much ado about Nothing acted by Command of his Majesty  November    WITH doubtjoyapprehension almost dumb  Once more to face this awful court I come  Lest Benedict should suffer by my fear  Before he enters I myself am here  I'm told what flatt'ry to my heart that you  Looking at and respectfully bowing to his Majesty  Have wish'd to see me nay have press'd it too  Alas 'twill prove another much ado  I like a boy who long has truant play'd  No lessons got no exercises made  On bloody Monday take my fearful stand  And often eye the birchenscepter'd hand  'Tis twice twelve years since first the stage I trod  Enjoy'd your smiles and felt the critics rod  A very ninepin I my stagelife through  Knock'd down by wits set up again by you  In four and twenty years the spirits cool  Is it not long enough to play the fool  To prove it is permit me to repeat  What late I heard in passing thro' the street  A youth of parts with ladies by his side  Thus cock'd his glass and through it shot my pride  ' 'Tis he by Jove grown quite a clumsy fellow  ' He's fit for nothingbut a Punchinello'  ' O yes for comic scenes Sir Johnno further  ' He's much too fatfor battles rape and murther'  Worn in the service you my faults will spare  And make allowance for the wear and tear  The Chelsea pensioner who rich in scars  Fights o'er in prattle all his former wars  Tho' past the service may the young ones teach  To marchpresentto fireand mount the breach  Should the drum beat to arms at first he'll grieve  For wooden leg lost eyeand armless sleeve  Then cocks his hat looks fierce and swells his chest  'Tis for my King and zounds I'll do my best  XLIX PROLOGUE to the CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE  A Comedy by Mr Colman and Mr Garrick acted at Drurylane February    Spoken by Mr HOLLAND  POETS and painters who from nature draw  Their best and richest stores have made this law  That each should neighbourly assist his brother  And steal with decency from one another  Tonight your matchless Hogarth gives the thought  Which from his canvas to the stage is brought  And who so fit to warm the poet's mind  As he who pictur'd morals and mankind  But not the same their characters and scenes  Both labour for one end by different means  Each as it suits him takes a separate road  Their one great object Marriage Alamode  Where Titles deign with Cits to have and hold  And change rich blood for more substantial gold  And honour'd trade from interest turns aside  To hazard happiness for titled pride  The painter dead yet still he charms the eye  While England lives his fame can never die  But he who  struts his hour upon the stage  Can scarce extend his fame for half an age  Nor pen nor pencil can the Actor save  The art and artist share one common grave  O let me drop one tributary tear  On poor Jack Falstaff's grave and Juliet's bier  Mr Quin died st January and Mrs Cibber st of the same month    You to their worth must testimony give  'Tis in your hearts alone their fame can live  Still as the scenes of life will shift away  The strong impressions of their art decay  Your children cannot feel what you have known  They'll boast of Quins and Cibbers of their own  The greatest glory of our happy sew  Is to be felt and be approv'd by YOU  L EPILOGUE to the CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE  CHARACTERS of the EPILOGUE  Lord Minum  Mr Dodd

will convince ye all and strong ones  Except old folks who hanker after young ones  Bud was so passionate and grown so thrifty  'Twas a sad lifeand then he was near fifty  I'm but nineteenmy husband too is young  So soft so gentle such a winning tongue  Have I pray ladies speak done very wrong  As for poor Bud 'twas honest to deceive him  More virtuous sure to cheat him than to grieve him  Great folk I know will call me simple slut  Marry for love they cry the country put  Marriage with them's a fashionsoon grows cool  But I'm for loving always like a fool  With half my fortune I would rather

acted at Drurylane December    Spoken by Mrs YATES  EXHAUSTED quite with prisons racks and death  Permit me here to take a little breath  You who have seen my actions know their springs  Say are we women such insipid things  Say lords of the creation mighty men  In what have you surpass'd us where and when  I come to know to whom the palm is due  To us weak vessels or to stronger you  Against your conqu'ring swords I drawmy fan  Come onnow parry Marg'ret  Marg'ret of Anjou the character in the play performed by Mrs Yates  if you can  Sets herself in a posture of defence  Stand up ye boasters  to the pit  don't there sneaking sit  Are you for pleasure politicks or wit  The Boxes smile to see me scold the Pit  Their turn is nextand tho' I will not wrong 'em  A woeful havock there will be among 'em  You our best friends love cherish and respect us  Not take our fortunes marry and neglect us  You think indeed that as you please you rule us  And with a strange importance often school us  Yet let each citizen describe a brother  I'll tell you what you say of one another  My neighbour leads poor soul a woeful life  A worthy manbut govern'd by his wife  How say you what all silent then 'tis true  We rule the citynow great sirs to  you  To the Boxes  What is your boast Would you like me have done  To free a captive wife or save a son  Rather than run such dangers of your lives  You'd leave your children and lock up your wives  When with your noblest deeds a nation rings  You are but puppets and we play the strings  We plan no battlestruebut out of fight  Crack goes the fanand armies halt or fight  You have the advantage ladies wisely reap it  And let me hint the only way to keep it  Let men of mean ideas have their fill  Frown bounce stride strut while you with happy skill  Like anglers use the finest silken thread  Give line enoughnor check a tugging head  The fish will flounder you with gentle hand  And soft degrees must bring the trout to land  A more specific nostrum cannot be  Probatum est  and never fails with  me  LIV PROLOGUE to CYMON  A Dramatick Romance by Mr Garrick acted at Drurylane January    For NewYear's Day  Spoken by Mr KING  I COME
