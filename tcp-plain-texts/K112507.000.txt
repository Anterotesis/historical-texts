 Robert Boyle c  _I WAS born at a SeaPort call'd  Boston  in  Lincolnshire  My Father was Captain and Owner of a MerchantShip that traded to the  WestIndies  but was cast away homewardbound upon the Rocks of  Silly  and but one Man sav'd of his whole Crew My Mother and I were at an Aunt's in  London  when the unhappy News of my Father's Death arriv'd  I was too young to feel my Loss but my Mother's Grief soon broke her Heart and left me a poor helpless Orphan not ten Years of Age It's true I had a tender Aunt that was in pretty good Circumstances who took Care of my Education I soon learnt to read and write a good Hand I understood a little  Latin  and was perfect Master of the  French  Tongue which I  had been learning from my Infancy my Mother being born at  Paris  where my Father marry'd her very young and brought her to reside at  Boston  By that time I had reach'd Fourteen Years of Age my Aunt told me it was Time for me to think of some Trade desiring me to chuse what I lik'd best and she would provide for me accordingly Said she If I might advise you I would have you study the  Law  under the Tuition of your Uncle But I told her I did not much care for any Calling that must owe its Prosperity to the Misfortune of others And at last I chose that of a Watchmaker as imagining my self to have a good mechanical Head Accordingly I went upon Liking as they call it and my Master and I agreeing very well I was bound with the usual Forms and found civil Usage from him in respect of my Birth and the Misfortunes of our Family  My Aunt paid Forty Guineas which was reckon'd at that Time a great Price but he was one of the Top of his Business and besides to find me in Cloaths and other Necessaries during my Seven Years Apprenticeship  The first Half Year we agreed very well but within that Time my Master had married a Wife of a pretty good Fortune and a large Share of Illnature In a Month's time she began to tyrannize over my Master as well as me and soon prov'd as the Saying is  The grey Mare to be the better Horse  She brought it to that Pass at last that I was obliged to go on all her halfpenny Errands and carry her Book to Church of a  Sunday  after her I bore this tolerably well but not without complaining to my Aunt who advis'd me to make my self as easy as I could for she fear'd Speaking would do no good  I went on this Way for a whole Year and then to compleat my Misfortunes my poor Aunt died of a Dropsy This indeed was the greatest Shock of all my Life for while she liv'd I felt no want of Father or Mother She left me  l  and my Uncleto be my Guardian I shall forbear mentioning his Name not out of Regard to him but of his Children who have prov'd a sweet Grafting from a sour Stock and as good as he was base  My Shrew of a Mistress continu'd her Illnature to me and one Accident made her prove outragious  My Master had a vast Trade and vented a great many Watches beyond Sea One Day he had a large Parcel of them to go on Board a Ship bound for  Lisbon  the Vessel lay at  Deptford  and my Master was pleas'd to take me along with him in the Boat  Before we were got to  Limehouse  my Master call'd to Mind that he had forgot a Silver Watch that he had purposely made for the Captain of the Ship He landed me at  RatcliffCross  and desir'd I would be expeditious in going for the Tide running downwards I could get to the  Exchange  sooner on Foot than by Water against the Stream then to take Boat at  Billingsgate  and follow him to the Ship  I ran almost all the Way and I believe got to the  Exchange  in half an Hour When I came home I found no Body in the Shop but my FellowPrentice who inform'd me my Mistress was above I went immediately up Stairs for the Watch for my Master told me he had left it in his own Room being he had wore it several Days to prove the going of it but found the Door shut Standing a Moment to consider I heard a Man's Voice speaking to my Mistress  in a low Key and I soon understood by their Dialogue that Love was the Subject they talk'd of I listen'd some Time till I found they had left off Discoursing and were enter'd upon Action  Now at the Head of the Stairs the Maid had left a StepLadder that she had us'd in the Morning in nailing up some Valens to the Windows in the DiningRoom and there being a Glass over the Chamber Door I had a great Mind to see who it was that was doing my Master's Business in his Absence Thereupon I fixt the Ladder very softly against the Wainscot by the Door and up I got but leaning towards the Window in order to see into the Room my Weight made the Ladder slip and the Top sliding against the Door burst it open and in fell I into the Room Ladder and all with no little Noise  The loving Couple were mightily surpriz'd you may be sure and were in such a Fright that they had forgot what they were a doing But I saw enough to convince me that my Master was in a fair way to get to Heaven purely upon my Mistress's Account  After our Surprize was over and every thing put in Order again between the Gentleman and Madam I ventur'd to tell her my Errand She gave me the Watch with a hearty good Box on the Ear and told me she wonder'd how I had the Assurance to come up without Knocking but added she I believe you rather came upon some knavish Design and had intended to rob your Master if I had not been in the Room with my Physician that came on purpose to see how I did  It was plain enough what Physic she was taking yet I made my Excuse to her that I went to remove the Ladder and it fell out of my  Hand against the Door and burst it open but I told her I was sorry I had disturb'd her made my Honours and walk'd off taking no Notice that I had seen any Thing I took Water at  Billingsgate  and follow'd my Master  In the Boat I began to ruminate with my self whether I had best keep this Accident a Secret or disclose it to my Master At last with many Pro's and Con's with my self I resolv'd to acquaint him with it partly to be reveng'd on my Mistress for the Blow she struck me and on the other side not to let my honest Master be kept in Ignorance of her Usage of him  When I came on Board the Captain commanded me with my Master's leave to sit down at Table with 'em We din'd heartily the Wine and Punch went merrily round and my Master the Captain with two more that were Passengers began to be in high Mirth when Word was brought that the Captain's Lady as the Messenger call'd her would be on Board in an Hour to take her Leave of him My Master upon this Message began to be merry with the Captain I wonder said he that you Seafaring Men will venture upon Wives Why so reply'd the Captain Why so return'd my Master Because in my Opinion it should put you in Mind of  Cuckold'sPoint  as you went by Water Your Absence gives 'em such a Conveniency that I believe few let slip the Opportunity Why answer'd the Captain mayn't your Wife even now be doing you the Favour has she not Time enough d'ye imagine The Thing's soon done and if they have an Inclination Watching and Restraint will do no Good Many an Alderman has been cornuted while upon  Change  and I knew a Parson's Wife that seldom went to Church but took  Time by the Forelock and while the Husband good Man was taking Care of his Flock the good Woman at Home was at her Occupation with her Gallant a rich young Farmer But the Parson one Afternoon being taken suddenly ill with a Giddiness in his Head was convey'd Home before he had begun his Work and there soon found the Occasion of his Pain for he had been breeding Horns as Children breed Teeth a little unkindly But however the Parson having Witnesses enough of his Promotion in the Herd of Cuckolds went to Law with the Farmer and recover'd  l  Damages and yet he has been heard often to say that his Wife's Tenement was never the worse  This Story occasion'd some other much to the same Purpose At last my Master and I the Tide being turn'd took our Leaves of the Company and wish'd 'em a good Voyage Coming by  Cuckold'sPoint  my Master cry'd  Robin  why don't you pull off your Hat to the Gentleman in the Window yonder I pull'd off my Hat very orderly but saw no Body at which my Master fell into a great Fit of Laughter and cry'd I had been very courteous to the Horns I then understanding his Meaning told him that it was only for marry'd Men to shew their Complaisance that way and being a little piqu'd at the Affront I thought put upon me said I believ'd most marry'd Men were or would be in the List of Cuckolds Why how now Sirrah reply'd my Master d'ye think I am or shall be a Cuckold Why truly said I Sir I have but little Reason to believe my Mistress a Saint more than any other Woman and to inform you farther of what I have seen to Day I beg you would be pleas'd to go to some Publick House that we may not be observed  by the Watermen My Master's Colour began to change upon this and being very impatient to be inform'd of what I knew order'd the Waterman to land at  RatcliffCross  and wait a while  We went to the  Ship  Tavern and had a private Room where I declar'd to him the whole Truth After many Questions and Answers between us I soon found he believed all that I told him for he turn'd as pale as Ashes and the Tears stood in his Eyes I then was sorry I had disclos'd it to him remembring the inimitable  Shakespear  He that is robb'd not wanting what is stole  Let him not know't and he's not robb'd at all  After some Time being silent my Master broke into many extravagant Words and threatning Actions and at last I ventur'd to tell him I thought him in the wrong to grieve at what could not be called back and I wonder'd the World should unjustly cast upon the Man the Ignominy which was properly due to the Woman for her Licentiousness  After some Time he began to be more calm and made me this Compliment  Robin  said he I have observed in thee a more than common Understanding Pr'ythee tell me in what Manner I shall behave my self in this Affait I thank you Sir said I for your good Opinion of me and were it my own Case I would not take any Notice of it till I found her in the Fact or such Circumstances that even she her self could not deny and for these two Reasons Whenever it comes to an open Rupture you'll have but an uneasie Living and that she may take it into her Head to deny  it and then the whole Weight of her Anger will fall upon me and truly said I I have too much of her Illnature already to bear any more with any manner of Patience  My Master resolved to follow my Counsel and intended to make his Wife believe he knew nothing of the Matter  My Master could not imagine who this Gallant should be by my Description for I had never seen him before We went to our Boat and so Home When we came in my Mistress ask'd my Master if  Robin  meaning me had been telling him any Stories Stories Child answer'd my Master what Stories he has told me nothing Nay no great matter said my Mistress but I gave him a Box on the Ear this Morning when he came back for the Watch you had forgot and I did not know but he had made some Complaint but I am sorry for it and will make him Amends one Time or other This she said so loud that I might hear  The next Day when my Master was gone to  Change  she came up into the Workhouse as we call'd it up three Pair of Stairs and took an Occasion of sending my FellowPrentice on some concerted Errand When he was gone out she sat down upon his Chair and look'd me in the Face for some time Well  Robin  said she I am very much oblig'd to you that you did not take any Notice of the Accident that happen'd Yesterday to your Master and to make you Amends for your Silence I give you this Broad Piece to buy you a Pair of Gloves with this Promise that you and I will never disagree again I receiv'd her Money and told her I should never take any farther Notice of it She call'd me good Lad and left me  My Master had not always an Opportunity of talking with me at home so he appointed me every  Sunday  after Sermon in the Evening at some Tavern or other that we might talk about the matter At our first Meeting I told him the Story of the Broad Piece and the Discourse my Mistress and I had together I shew'd him the Money and he soon knew the Piece to be his Wife's from the particular Fairness of it being the same he had some time ago given her for a PocketPiece  Now said he  Robin  I am fully convinc'd of the Infidelity of my Wife for notwithstanding your former Story I had some faint Hopes it might have been a Tale of thine rais'd out of Malice to thy Mistress from her indifferent Usage of thee  But now to find out this Spark that I may reak my Vengeance on him first for to own my Folly  Robin  I must tell thee I can't find I shall ever be able to hate this ungrateful Woman Some time after my Master was pretty well convinc'd that his Wife had been with her Spark to the  MulberryGarden  and my Master had discovered who he was he prov'd to be a young Attorney of  Clifford'sInn  The next Thing we consulted about at our weekly Meeting was how to give 'em an Opportunity of pursuing their Amour at Home In Order to this my Master gave out to my Mistress that he should be oblig'd to go as far as St  Margaret  's in  Kent  to look after some Goods that were landed there in order to avoid paying Custom for them and he fear'd the Affair would not be so well manag'd if he was not present  The  Tuesday  following was chose for the Day of his setting out My Master gave me  publick Orders to go to several Places in his Absence to look after the Workmen for there are several Trades belonging to the making of a Watch On  Tuesday  Morning my Master got on Horseback in Order as my Mistress and the rest of the Family thought to pursue his Journey But he went no farther than  Islington  and return'd putting up his Horse again and went strait to the Place of our Rendezvous  As soon as my Master was gone my Mistress call'd me up to her and ask'd me if I had Time to step a little Way for her I told her 'twas impossible being I had some Work to finish that I was oblig'd to carry out immediately Then she begg'd I would call her a Porter which I did and one of my particular Acquaintance one well to pass in the World for a City Porter in those Days was a very beneficial Employment there being then no PennyPostOffice I told him what he should do that he must go to my Mistress and receive the Letter and then to an adjacent Alehouse and wait till I came to him Accordingly he receiv'd the Letter and went to the Place I appointed I did not let him wait long but order'd my Matters as if I was going about my Master's Business and went to the Porter From thence I took him along with me to my Master where we open'd the Letter and found it as follows  "Dear  Tom  it's an Age since last I saw you the Cuckold's gone out of Town for a Week therefore meet me at the Old Place by Six this Evening"  Here we were at a Stand for we could not imagine where the  Old Place  was unless the  MulberryGarden  At last we resolv'd to send the Porter to the Spark and bring the Answer to us to see if that would give us more  Light in the Affair Accordingly he went and return'd with his Billet we made bold to open it and found it contain'd these Words  My Life I don't think the old Place convenient being a Brother Lawyer has discovered something of our Intrigue therefore I'll wait on you before the Time that we may concert Measures accordingly I am glad your Beast is out of Town we'll add another Antler to adorn his Brow assoon as I have the Happiness to see her who shall eternally command yours    When my Master perceiv'd that the Scene was to be open'd at his own House he began to demur But after keeping Silence a little Time he spoke to me to this purpose  Robin  this Letter has in some sort confounded our Design for what I intend to act I would not if it could be avoided put in Execution at home for fear it should make too much Noise for added he smiling tho' a Man has the Misfortune to be a Cuckold yet he would not have all the World know it I told him I was glad to see him so merry upon the Occasion but begg'd he would not keep the Porter any longer for fear of some Accident He thank'd me for my Care seal'd up the Letter again and sent him away with it When the Porter was gone my Master order'd me to go home again and observe how Matters went there and as soon as ever the Spark came to send the same Porter back to him with this Notice  That the Work was ready to carry home whenever I thought fit  I had not been at home a quarter of an Hour ere my Gentleman came in a Coach he went up Stairs but did not stay a Moment came down again whisper'd the Coachman and drove into  Cheapside  I was at a loss how to behave my self  but my Mistress order'd another Coach to be call'd When I found that I sent for the Porter and told him secretly that he must dog that Coach let it go where it would and be expeditious in bringing me Word My Mistress came down in her Hood and Mask in her Hand and went off in the Coach I look'd after her as far as I could see her and o  bser'd the Porter to jump up behind the Coach I immediately went to my Master and acquainted him with the Business He hurried me home again for fear the Porter should wait for me and order'd me to bring him when he came to the  Pope'sHead  Tavern because he would be nearer home  The Porter did not return in two Hours He told me that the Coach drove to  York  Stairs in  York  Buildings and there they got out and took a Pair of Oars he went in another and follow'd 'em till they landed at  Lambeth  and dog'd them into the  WhiteLyon  Inn There he staid some time to see if they intended to go from thence he walk'd into the Kitchen and drank a Mug of Ale and in a little time one of the Waiters came in and told the Cook the Gentleman and his Wife had bespoke a roasted Fowl and some Fish for their Dinner and had ordered clean Sheets to be put to air for as soon as they had din'd they design'd to go to Bed being the Stage Coach was to call them up at One the next Morning  I did not think it altogether so proper to take the Porter to the  Pope'sHead  to my Master but went alone where I found him with another Gentleman a Stranger to me When I had given him an Account we took Coach all together and drove to the HorseFerry  Westminster  took Boat and landed at  Lambeth  We all went into the  WhiteLyon  the back Way and I went  to the Drawer as we had before concerted and ask'd if there was not a Gentleman and a Lady that did design to lie there all Night to wait for a Stage Coach in the Morning he answer'd in the Affirmative but added they were that moment gone to Bed that they might be the better able to rise in the Morning I ask'd him which Room they lay in for that I had Business of great Consequence to communicate to him Why that Room up one Pair of Stairs answer'd the Drawer and pointed at the Door Well said I fetch me a Pint of Wine I'll drink a Glass and then go and wait on them  The Drawer ran down for the Wine and in the mean time I beckon'd my Master up Stairs we went I set my Foot against the Door burst it open and there we soon perceiv'd the loving Couple playing at  Rantum Scantum  I shut to the Door again and stood Guard that no One should enter My Master laid fast hold of my naked Gentleman and with the Assistance of his Friend threw him upon his Back clapt a Pistol to his Breast and swore he would shoot him if he offer'd to stir or cry out Then my Master's Friend took out a Box of Instruments and with a Pair of Scissars for that purpose soon depriv'd him of what  Senesino  and several  Italian  Singers want as well as our Spark The Thing was done so suddenly that I believe my Gentleman hardly knew his Loss till he felt the Blood trickle about his Legs He made several Attempts to get up but to no purpose My Master told him he had better be quiet for fear he should be worse serv'd but in my Opinion that could hardly be The Surgeon for it prov'd my Master's Friend was no other had all his Implements about him he manag'd his Needle his Plaisters and Salves and finish'd my  Gentleman and would have had him gone home something lighter than he came but he prov'd so weak with Loss of Blood and the Pain together that he fainted away  My Mistress had hid herself behind the Curtain and did not so much as say one Word but in all her Concern she took Care to dress her self and when she had done she sat upon the Bedside next the Wall and seem'd to be in deep Discontent  We had got my Gentleman to himself again by the help of the Drawer who soon found how Matters went When we had done my Master said to his Wife Madam I must confess I was to blame to disturb you in your Diversion but I own my Fault and will endeavour to mend it by leaving you together to solace your selves and so I take my Leave  Upon this we march'd down Stairs paid for our Wine and went to our Boat that waited for us and landed at the  Stillyard  My Master was very uneasie all the Way home and we could not get one Word out of him He went up Stairs lock'd himself in his Room and remain'd alone several Hours I would have been willing to have diverted his Melancholy but did not well know how I should go about it  Near seven a Clock in the Evening he call'd me up Stairs and ask'd me if I had heard any thing of his Wife I told him no Nay said he if she has any Shame left she will hardly attempt to come home again in haste After some time he went out and did not come home again till twelve a Clock He ask'd me still after my Mistress and understanding we had no News of her went to Bed  The next Morning he order'd me to send the Porter to  Lambeth  to learn how they behav'd  themselvos when we had left 'em He return'd and told my Master that the Gentlewoman went away as soon as she found we were gone and left the Gentleman there who was so weak that he remain'd there still and had sent for several of his Acquaintance  In the Afternoon my Mistress's Mother came to my Master and they had a long Discourse and afterwards went out together But I was never more surpriz'd in my Life when he came home the same Evening with his Wife and Mother He vouchsaf'd to tell me the next Day that his Wife resolv'd never to be guilty of any Fault again and by her Submission and the Intreaties of her Mother he had resolv'd to take her home once more Sir said I if you can forgive her no one else has any thing to do with it But added I I fear I shall feel the Effects of her Displeasure No answer'd my Master that was one of my Conditions with your Mistress that she should take no Notice to you of past Transactions And truly she kept her Word for she would not so much as look at me  She continu'd very reserv'd for a great while and never went out but to Church of a  Sunday  In the latter End of the same Year my Master began to be out of Order and the Physician advis'd him to go into the Country for the Air and accordingly he took Lodgings at  Hampstead  where my Mistress us'd to go twice or thrice every Week to see him and my Master told me when I went of a  Sunday  to wait upon him to give him an Account of the Business of the Shop that his Wife had been so tender of him in his Illness that he verily believed he should never have any Occasion to blame  her Conduct again I told him I was as well pleas'd as he was  About a Week afterwards my Mistress went in and out very often and feem'd to be very busie giving Orders to my FellowPrentice for taking her a Place in the  Hampstead  Coach as usual This happen'd on the  Tuesday  and I saw her no more that Week  When I went to my Master on the  Sunday  following he ask'd me if my Mistress was out of Order being he had not seen her since the  Monday  last Nor I since  Tuesday  said I but I thought she had been with you for she took a Place in the Coach in order to come to you that Day and sent out several Bundles to be carry'd as she usually did when she was coming to wait on you  My Master was so confounded with what I told him that he did not offer to speak for some time and the Sweat ran down his Face like Drops of Rain At last said he  Robin  I fear all is not well My Wife has certainly undone me Come hope for the best said I  Well my Master resolv'd weak as he was to go for  London  immediately We took a Coach and soon got home and there to our great Sorrow found my Mistress had robb'd my Master to the Value of Five Thousand Pound in  Bank  Notes and Money with Six and Thirty Gold Watches and Seventeen Silver Ones besides her own wearing Cloaths My Master at this Loss sunk down upon his Bed I went and fetch'd some of his Neighbours and Friends to comfort him while I ran up and down like a Madman to see if I could get any Tidings of the Thief  I went to give Orders at the  Bank  to stop Payment but to my great Sorrow found the Money had been receiv'd four Days before I  came back to acquaint my Master with my ill Success and found him alone and gone to Bed When I told him I could not hear any Tidings of my Mistress and that the Money had been receiv'd he cry'd  Robin  it is not the Money that grieves me but the ill Usage of my Wife 'tis that has got to my Heart and never to be remov'd till Death I sat up with him a great while till he told me he began to be sleepy and ordered me to retire but as I was going from him he took me by the Hand and bid me good Night I found by his Pulse that he was in a Fever and begg'd I might call a Physician but he said he should be better on the Morning if not he would send for one Finding him willing to rest I left him and went to Bed  As soon as I wak'd in the Morning I put on my Gown and went to see how he did but found him so weak and faint that he had not Strength enough to lift up his Head I was immediately running to fetch a Physician that liv'd hard by our House but my Master call'd me back and told me it was too late for said he I feel my last Moment approaching He order'd me to sit upon the Bed by him he took my Hand in his which burnt like Fire and said  Robin  my Wife has kill'd me I could have born any other Misfortune with Temper if thou ever shou'dst see her tell her from me that I forgive her and that I beg she would reform her Life but also let her know that she was the Death of me I told him I would not have him talk of Dying for an ungrateful Woman that did not deserve the least Regard but to chear up his Spirits and let me go for a Physician No said he all Physic or Counsel comes too late  I've that within which baffles all their Art  Sure Means to make the Soul and Body part  A burning Fever and a broken Heart  He had no sooner repeated those Lines but his Speech fail'd him his Eyes clos'd and he expir'd only with a Sigh  I must confess I was inwardly shock'd and the Spirit of Revenge rose in my Soul against the barbarous Cause of his End  When I had a little recollected my scattered Thoughts I went to a Cousin of my Master's that liv'd in  Cheapside  and desir'd he would come and take Care of his Affairs For my own Part I could not compose my self for two or three Days At last I went to my Uncle and desir'd he would let me have Twenty Pounds to buy me Mourning for I did intend to wear Black that my melancholy Outside might conform with what I felt within out of Respect to my Master's Memory Mourning  Bob  answer'd my Uncle Why if thy Master's Friends won't give it thee 'tis my Opinion thou ought'st not to think on't Yes Sir added I I think it my Duty for tho' my Mistress us'd me ill my Master always was civil to me But my Uncle told me in plain Terms that I should not have a Farthing I told him I wanted but my own but he reply'd when he thought I was of Years enough to manage my Money my self perhaps I might be trusted with it but at present he would take Care of it for me  I was very uneasy at this Affair for it began to look as if he intended to cheat me of it and I did not stick to tell him my Sentiments in a civil manner but to no purpose I left him with a very heavy Heart and came home I  went to Bed in the utmost Confusion of Thought yet notwithstanding my Discontent slept 'till Morning I got up about six aclock with a scurvy Idea of my future Fortune About eight my Uncle's Man brought me a Letter from him in which he begg'd my Pardon and told me it was only to try my Temper The Man gave me ten Guineas by his Order and farther told me that his Taylor would be with me immediately to take my Directions and accordingly before the Fellow was gone he came took Measure of me and told me he would be sure to bring my Cloaths home by twelve aclock the next Day and he kept his Word with me  In the mean time I had provided my self with every Thing else with the Money my Uncle had sent me and the same Evening waited on him to return him Thanks  Bob  said he I had only a Mind to try your Temper and I find thou art Father's own Child a Chip of the old Block  He would have me stay to sup with him and among other Discourse he ask'd me what I did intend to do now my Master was dead for he did not suppose I was Master of my Trade enough to follow it I reply'd I knew enough to recommend my self to any other Master without paying any more Money My Uncle reply'd I needed not be in such haste but take some Time to consider of it and in the mean while I should live with him and be heartily welcome And to make his Actions agree with his Words he gave me five Guineas more for PocketMoney and gave Directions for me to be with one of his Clerks a goodnatured young Fellow that was a Schoolfellow of mine  I was very glad of the Occasion living with my Uncle in great Tranquility the space of a  Month and all the time he seem'd to be very fond of me never denying me any thing that I ask'd him  One  Sunday  Morning before Churchtime he call'd me to him and after many Professions of Friendship ask'd me if I had never done any Business for my Master out of the Watchmaking Trade I pretty well guess'd at what he meant and answer'd him in the Affirmative Very well said he I must send you as far as  Gravesend  tomorrow about the same Affair and if I executed my Commission dextrously he told me it should be the better for me  The next Morning I got up and my Uncle sent me with a Letter into  PallMall  to a Client of his and returning with an Answer found him taking his Leave of a Gentleman that look'd like a SeaOfficer As soon as their Compliments were over my Uncle dispatch'd me away to  Billingsgate  and gave me Instructions what to do I was to enquire for a Ship call'd the  Success  Capt  Stokes  Commander at  Gravesend  and then to follow his Directions  As I was talking with my Uncle my Bedfellow thrust a Book into my Pocket and told me that would divert me in the Boat if I had not Company that I lik'd I did not much regard what he said but went about my Business got into the  Gravesend  Boat which put off upon the Instant and had the Fortune to light of good Company and one young Man that was going to the same Ship as I was  We were very merry all the Way with little Stories we told among our selves We got on Board the  Success  about two aclock in the Afternoon and the first Person I saw was the same Man that I found with my Uncle in the Morning He took me by the Hand and carry'd  me into the Cabin and set a Piece of Ship Beef before me When I had din'd he inform'd me my Things would be on Board immediately I told him it was very well not suspecting any thing Afterwards the Captain went out and left me alone in the Cabin I got up and looking out of the Cabin Window found the Ship was under Sail At first I began to be surpriz'd but yet was so ignorant that I thought we were sailing up the River While I was ruminating on the Matter the Captain came and told me my Things were ready for me whenever I wou'd I went out but how was I surpriz'd when I saw my Trunk that I left at my Uncle's with all my Cloaths in it I was in such Confusion that I had not Power to utter one Word for some time At last recovering out of my Surprize I ask'd him the Meaning of what I saw Meaning Child reply'd the Captain Why what's the Matter would you go such a Voyage as we are upon without Necessaries What Voyage return'd I Why to  Virginia  reply'd the Captain At that Answer I sat me down upon my Chest and burst into Tears and had such a Combat in my Mind that bereav'd me of the Power even of thinking for some time The Captain indeed did all he could to comfort me At last I fancy'd it might be only a Jest but to my Sorrow found by all their Discourse it was but too much in earnest  The Captain declar'd that my Uncle had bargain'd with him for my Passage and that I was to be deliver'd to a Relation I had in  CharlesTown  upon the Continent of  America  I ask'd  he Name but he told me one that I had ne  er heard of before  When I found I was certainly betray'd by my  arbarous Uncle I fell upon my Knees and  begg'd the Captain to put me on Shore and I would find some Means to pay the Sum he was to have for my Passage He answer'd he was too well paid already to let me go on Shore again and further added I had nothing to do but to make my self easy for I was not likely to set my Foot in  Europe  till I had first seen  America  I found it was to no purpose to intreat any further It is true I had no Aversion for the Sea but rather an Inclination and if my Uncle had made any Proposals to me concerning such a Voyage and properly prepar'd 'tis ten to one if I had not accepted it But in this manner to be kidnapp'd for it was no better and then the Dread of being parted with as a Slave when I came thither shock'd me prodigiously But being naturally of an easy Temper eight or ten Days pretty well wore off my Apprehensions and I began to be contented with my wretched Fate I set my self with all my Diligence to learn the Mathematicks as also the Work of a Sailor and quickly attain'd to some Knowledge I soon ingratiated my self with most of the Crew▪ who instructed me in all they knew  I mention'd a Book my Uncle's Clerk put in my Pocket as I left the Chambers that Morning I was trepann'd which for the first three or four Days I did not remember but putting my Hand in my Pocket to feel for something else I took it out and found in it a Letter directed for me which was as follows  Dear  Bob  WHen you went to St  James  's this Morning  supposing I would have read it the Day I receiv'd it  I overheard my Master discoursin  with a Captain of a Ship and I learnt that h  intends to send you to  Virginia  I could not understand the Particulars but enough to know the Bargain is made My Friendship to you and the Barbarity of your Uncle obliges me to give you this I hope timely Notice I shall leave the Management to you but whatever Steps you take I am not to be in the Question and I thought of this way to acquaint you with it fearing I should not have the Opportunity of speaking to you Farewell till I see you again which I hope in God will not be long  A M  This Letter made me curse my Fate again for if I had had the good Fortune to have read it before I was on Shipboard I might have prevented my Uncle's Design But it was my Destiny and therefore I submitted to it  We met with nothing in our Voyage till we came near the  Canaries  When one Evening we heard several Cannons fir'd as we suppos'd two Leagues from us Our Captain alter'd his Course in order to avoid a Rencounter with an Enemy for our Ship carry'd but ten Guns and twenty Men besides Passengers But notwithstanding the Captain's Care as soon as ever the Morning dawn'd and the Fog was clear'd up we found our selves within half a Mile of a Rover of  Barbary  We were all mightily surpriz'd for the Gally made up to us with Sails and Oars being to Windward of us Our Captain advis'd us to surrender immediately but the Sailors were for fighting and were confirm'd in their Opinion upon Sight of another Vessel bearing down upon us whom they knew to be  Spanish  by her Colours All our Guns were immediately brought to the Starboard Side and every Body ready to engage Passengers and all who were willing to preserve their Liberty  The Rover by this time was just upon the Starboard Bow and prepar'd to board us We had some Hand Granadoes on board with several other Stores for our Fort at  CharlesTown  and a Gunner as one of our Passengers He ordered several Men into our MainTop with Granadoes and follow'd himself and as soon as ever the Gally came near enough our Men at the Helm bore away and fir'd our Guns upon him which rak'd 'em fore and aft and did much Execution Our Gunner above in the Top threw in upon them with his Granadoes which we could perceive put them into much Confusion But all this would not have avail'd if they had not perceiv'd the  Spanish  Man of War bearing upon us They did not make any farther Attempts to board us but they fir'd their Cannon and gaul'd us with their small Arms  I had gotten a Musket on board and had discharg'd it as I thought for it flash'd in the Pan and the Noise of the other Pieces deceiv'd me I charg'd again but then found by the Rammer that my Piece had not gone off However I was resolv'd to fire it I stood upon the larboard Gunnel just upon the Forecastle to be as far from the Enemy as I could and fir'd my Piece but being double charg'd and a stubborn Jade gave me such a Bang that threw me over the Side of our Ship my Foot hung in the Fore Change for some time but struggling with my Head downwards to raise my self up my Foot disentangled and I fell plum into the Sea  Altho' I had learnt to swim in  England  yet the Fright the Smoke and all together took away my Understanding and I found by my Strugling that I had got within ten Yards of the Rover and she that Instant bearing away before the Wind they did me the Favour to stun me  with a Stroke of one of their Oars and took me on board them  They row'd with all their Strength and the Wind being in their Stern they insensibly left the  Success  who flatted their Sails and laid by till the  Spanish  Ship came up with her and then we could perceive 'em both making after the Rover  The Captain of the Corsair was an  Irish Renegado  and as soon as he was out of Danger he sent for me into the Cabin and ask'd me several Questions concerning our Ship where she was bound and who I was for he took me for more than a common Sailor being I was not in a Sailor's Habit I told him my Story as I have related in the foregoing Sheets He shook his Head and with a Smile said I was very ready at a Lie Sir said I I am so far from lying that I jump'd overboard on purpose to come to your Vessel rather than to stay with them chusing to be a Slave nearer home than to go I don't know where with the Knave that trepann'd me And to convince your Honour of the Truth for I  honour'd  him much here's the Letter which my Uncle's Clerk slipp'd into my Pocket in a Book for by good Fortune I had the Letter and Book in my Pocket when I fell overboard At reading the Letter he was convinc'd he said of my Sincerity and thou shalt see added he notwithstanding the bad Opinion is held of us  Renegado's  that you shall fare the better for your Confidence in us Sir return'd I this Accident may convince you that I thought very well of your Honour for as soon as I saw your Honour upon Deck giving Command I thought you had the Look of a Gentleman tho' by the By he had a damn'd  Tyburn  Face  I clarkt him up so well with  your Honour  that he began to fancy himself a Hero indeed He order'd my Chains to be taken off for they had done me the Favour to provide me some assoon as ever they had got me on board and told me that if I would turn  Mahometan  I should have Command under him I answer'd him I hop'd he would give me some Time to consider of it Ay ay Time thou shalt have half a Year's Time to consider of it return'd the Captain He carry'd me out upon Deck and told my Story to his Crew who were mightily pleas'd with the Relation and saluted me after the  Moorish  manner by bowing their Heads and clapping their Hands across upon their Breasts  There were several other  English Renegado's  that were Officers in the Galley but most of the common Sailors were natural  Moors  The Captain told me that he did design to make for  Sallee  with all the Expedition he could for he had engag'd with a  Spanish  Man of War the Night before and had suffer'd very much in both his Vessel and Crew but he told me he would soon be out again for he had another Vessel ready in  Sallee  Road to put out to Sea We had before Night lost Sight of the  Success  and  Spanish  Man of War that had so luckily freed her from the Infidels Clutches and we steer'd for  Sallee  Ten Days after we discover'd the  African  Shore within five Leagues West of  Sallee  Road and the Wind favouring us we anchor'd in the Harbour by Six in the Evening The Captain went ashore but ordered me to remain on Board till the next Day  I must confess I began to have some Hopes of seeing my own Country again but yet did  not know how to bring it about however I resolv'd to trust Providence  The next Morning my Master sent for me on Shore by a young  Renegado  Sailor born at  London  whose Christian Name I learnt was  Francis Corbet  but had exchang'd it for  Mustapha  a good intelligent young Fellow and one that was a perfect Master of the Mathematicks The Reason why he did not accompany the Captain in this Voyage was a violent Fever when he set Sail I ask'd him why he could forget the Saviour of the World to turn  Mahometan  he told me that he was only one from the Teeth outward and he thought it better to trust God with his Soul than those barbarous Wretches with his Body I thought it was a pretty free Declaration to one that was an utter Stranger to him  As soon as we were landed I had the whole Town of  Sallee  staring at me for the Captain of the Rover had taken Care to spread my Story among 'em and I had as much Respect shown me by the People of the Town as he had He took me home to his own House and us'd me with much Civility for a Week or ten Days during that time he had carry'd me twice or thrice to his Country House about six Miles up the River It was a very pleasant Place situated in a little Wood with the River running round it and no approaching to it but over a Drawbridge At this House his Wives liv'd for I was inform'd he had several  Observing his Garden I told him it was but indifferently kept He answer'd it was for want of a Gardener none of his Slaves understanding that Art I offer'd him my Service but told him I did not pretend to be a Gardiner but I was assur'd I could soon make Amendment to it  with the Help of some of his Servants He order'd me to take as many as I thought fit and added he because I am impatient to see it in a better condition I'll leave you here I told him I begg'd to be excus'd now because I should want several Things for my Designs If it be Tools said he or Seeds of all Sorts I have 'em here Upon which he carry'd me into a little House meant for a Greenhouse where I found every Thing that was wanting with a large Quantity of  European  Seeds and Roots I told him I was satisfy'd there was every thing that I should want The Captain order'd me a Bed to be made in the Greenhouse and an old Eunuch that understood  French  very well to wait on me with a strict Order that I should have every Thing I ask'd for but I was not to approach the House in his Absence upon any Account I told him I had no Curiosity that way and did not doubt but I should show him something that would please him the next time he came which was to be in Days  As soon as he was gone I went to Work for Gardening was what I always took delight in both Theoric and Practic  I drew out Plans order'd my Workmen and in six Days time brought it into some Form I perceiv'd in the middle of the Garden a Puddle of Water which I gave Directions to be drain'd and found that it had been formerly a Fountain but was only choak'd up with Filth by Neglect I ask'd the old Eunuch if he had ever known it to play and he answer'd in the negative neither did they imagine it to be any such thing for his Master had bought the Estate of an old  Spanish  Renegado four Years before and he told him it had been a FishPond I examin'd about the River and found the Head  of the Pipes stopp'd with Rubbish which I clear'd and by degrees the Water work'd thro' into the Fountain and out again thro' another Conveyance I observ'd that there had been Figures upon it by the Pipes I ask'd my Eunuch if he had ever seen any such things He told me there were several lying in a back Yard on the other Side the House I went with him and found four small Figures of  Tritons  and a  Neptune  in his Chariot drawn by SeaHorses I order'd them to be brought to the Fountain and fixt them on first stopping the Water and then letting it loose again finish'd my Fountain which plaid admirably out of the Shells of the  Tritons  which they seem'd to blow with from the Nostrils of the Horses and the Trident of the  Neptune  The Workmen were astonish'd to see with what Expedition I had compleated it and imagin'd I had dealt with the Devil The next Morning the Eunuch came to me before I was up and desir'd I'd give him the Key of my Chamber and be contented to be a Prisoner till he came to me again I was a little surpriz'd and ask'd him the Reason He told me he could not give me any being it was beyond his Commission Accordingly he lock'd me in and went away I began to ruminate about this Accident but could not imagine the Cause I had no Way to look out towards the Garden being the Windows of the Greenhouse look'd over the River into the Wood and the Back which frontted the House had only painted Windows for Ornament not Use In about two Hours my Eunuch came and releas'd me and we din'd together I us'd all the Rhetoric I was Master of to find out the Secret but to no Purpose he only added that I must be in the same Condition again the next Morning This was still  more surprizing and I began to think by Degrees I should entirely lose my Liberty The old Eunuch imagining my Thoughts assur'd me there was no harm meant to me This Afternoon was my last Day's Work and in three Days more I expected the Captain About an Hour before Night I perceiv'd another Eunuch of the House talking earnestly with him that us'd to attend me who immediately came to me and told me he must beg me to retire to my Chamber that Instant upon which I readily obey'd knowing it was to no purpose to contend  I was upon the Tenters to know the Reason of my Confinement Whilst I was employing my Thoughts about it I heard the Voices of Women It surpriz'd me at first but I soon sound that was the Reason of my being made a Prisoner When the Eunuch came to bring me my Supper I told him he need not have made such a Secret of what I was lock'd up for for I had found it out and then told him that I had heard Women's Voices in the Garden Did you said he surpriz'd I'll take Care they shall keep their Tongues within their Teeth for the future He said no more but immediately went out and soon return'd and told me I should hear no more of them I was confounded with this odd Proceeding and my Curiosity began to be more and more rais'd  When I was left alone I began to examine my Room where I was to see if I could find ever a Peephole and by good Fortune found one made by Time and ill Weather under the Penthouse I upon the instant of my Discovery made all the Use I could of it and soon perceiv'd three Women in the Walk with their Backs towards me They were in a  Turkish  Undress  with their Necks bare One of them above the rest seem'd to me to have a better Shape and Air than commonly the Women of  Morocco  have I don't know what came over me but I seem'd impatiently to expect their nearer Approach At last my Desires were answer'd for assoon as they had spent some Time at my new Fountain they directed their Steps towards my Confinement and when they were near enough I could distinguish them to be three handsome Women but one of 'em that seem'd to be very melancholy surpass'd the other two at least in my Opinion She seem'd to be about twenty fair to a Miracle and much like an  Englishwoman  She did not seem to converse with the other two but follow'd them with an Air of Contemplation and I could observe her sigh often I never till this Moment had the least Regard to any of the Female Sex no more than good Manners and Decency requir'd but I found my self in a Moment full of aching Tenderness for this strange Woman Though I had no time for Thought till the Ladies were retir'd I then began to reason with my self and found Love like Destiny was not to be avoided and the more I thought the more I was plung'd in this tormenting yet pleasing Passion Yet I thought it was very odd to fall in Love considering my Circumstances I had nothing to hope and all to fear I was poor a Prisoner and a Stranger far from my native Country in want even of Necessaries and to compleat my Misery sunk in one Hour an Age in Love Every new Thought seem'd a Thorn to torment me yet notwithstanding all these Difficulties a Beam of Hope would now and then shine thro' the thick Clouds of Despair and encourage me to love on From this Thought I began to think with Reason if  a Lover can be call'd a reasonable Creature how I should manage my Passion I began to reflect the  Moors  were jealous of their Women even to a Degree and did not in the least doubt but my  Irish Renegado  had learnt that Part of their Manners At last I pitch'd upon an odd Expedient I determin'd to shew to my Captain an utter Detestation of all Females and in truth the Usage my poor Master met with from his Wife very much lessen'd the Regard I ow'd the Sex and try what that would do This Thought seem'd to give me some Satisfaction and assoon as the Eunuch came to release me I begg'd he would sup with me that Evening He accordingly promis'd me and came immediately with my Supper and brought under his Garment a Bottle of excellent  Greek  Wine I must confess I was surpriz'd and pleas'd for as I knew the  Moors  are restrain'd from Wine I did not expect any there The Eunuch told me smiling that he had brought that Cordial to make me Amends for the Loss of my Liberty for though added he  Mussulmen  are not allow'd to drink Wine we very well know you  Europeans  seldom eat without it and our Master meaning the Captain is not so strict a  Mussulman  but he drinks much himself and procures privately great Quantities for his own Use I told him I thought  Mahomet  order'd his Followers to abstain from Wine because an immoderate Use of it generally turn'd to immoderate Passions but to take it sparingly gave Health and Vigour to the Body and Chearfulness to the Spirits He agreed with me in my Sentiments and show'd he approv'd of them by drinking to me Notwithstanding my Endeavours to hide the Trouble of my Spirit my kind Eunuch took Notice of a Concern in my Countenance  and chear'd me up with repeated Glasses and imagining my Confinement caus'd that Alteration told me he would not have me take to Heart the small Abridgement of my Liberty for assoon as his Master arriv'd I should not be restrain'd any more for the Cause would cease by the Confinement of the Ladies to their several Apartments I told him with a seeming Joy that I should be mightily pleas'd when that should happen for I abhorr'd the Sight of them Women were my utter Aversion and had been from my Infancy and that Aversion was aggravated by the Knowledge of their Perfidy and I thought it the greatest Curse could fall upon that noble Creature Man not to be born without them Upon this I told him the Story of my Master and Mistress and several extravagant Tales of my own Invention which painted that beautiful Part of the Creation in the Colour of the Devil My Companion prais'd me for slighting the Sex and back'd my Stories with as many of his own Knowledge Between our familiar Talk and our  Greek  Wine he began to be very loquacious He told me his Master after the Mode of the  Moors  had several Wives beside a Captive that he had lately taken that seem'd averse to his Passion and all the Rhetoric he was Master of could not prevail He did not know he said what Countrywoman she was but she spoke very good  French  I imagin'd this could be no other than that sweet Creature I had seen I chang'd Colour but to put it off said A Pox take all the Sex don't let's talk of them any more I am afraid said he you love to converse with the Men and that makes you slight the Women I did not immediately understand him but he soon explain'd upon it and then I was no longer ignorant I told  him it was of such a beastly Nature that I was of Opinion those Persons that us'd it should be treated worse than Beasts Why reply'd he it is so common here that 'tis reckon'd only a Piece of Gallantry Well said I I hate that Action even worse if it be possible than the Sight of the Female Sex The old Man and I parted like two Friends but before he went I told him he need not give himself any great Trouble to lock me in for the future for I would take Care of my self Well well said he and shook his Head I believe I may trust you As soon as he was gone I went to Bed not to Sleep for I had Thought enough about me to keep me waking I began to conceive a great deal of Hopes from my Dissimulation I spent the whole Night in thinking of a thousand Expedients to forward my Designs till I had thought of so many that they were all confus'd like a Skein of Silk pull'd the wrong way At last with the Fatigue of Thought I fell asleep till Sunrising nor awak'd till I heard Voices in the Garden I ran immediately and barr'd my Door on the Inside for fear of being discovered at my Peephole huddled on my Cloaths and ran up where I saw my lovely Charmer reading in a Book walking by her self in the Alley that led to my Prison The other Women were got about the Fountain admiring the playing of the Water She drew nearer me but what was my pleasing Surprize when I heard her repeat the following Lines in  English  My Grief lies all within  And those external manners of Laments  Are meely Shadows to the unseen Grief  That swells with Silence in my tortur'd Soul  I must confess the Transports I felt were beyond Expression She had such a Softness in her Voice and yet so musical that it made my Blood thrill thro' my Veins In short during the time I beheld her I was in such an Ecstasie that all my Cares were forgot She turn'd up the Walk again but I follow'd her with my longing Eyes till she was out of Sight I then turn'd them into my Imagination and there beheld her still  I was convinc'd she was an  English  Woman and kept in her Restraint against her Will I soon resolv'd with my self to find some Expedient to let her know I would serve her all that lay in my Power if she was dispos'd to accept it  I had staid so long fixt at my Peephole that the old Eunuch knock'd at my Door which soon rouz'd me from my pleasing Thoughts and put me upon another Task which was to dissemble I suffer'd him to knock twice or thrice before I let him in at last I open'd the Door when he had call'd to me to give me to know who it was Assoon as he was enter'd I began to exclaim against him in a friendly manner said I You promis'd me Yesterday that I should not be troubled with the Tongues of those Female Devils and I have been so plagu'd with them for an Hour together that I was oblig'd to shut my Door and run up Stairs to be free from the Sound He smiling told me the Fumes of the Wine which he drank overnight had drove it out of his Thoughts but he would be sure to give them a Caution to hold their Tongues for the time to come But then added I I may be surpriz'd by them when I little expect 'em No said he I'll take Care to send or bring you Word when they are dispos'd to walk  in the Garden again I thank'd him for his Caution He told me he did design to come and dine with me that Day for added he I shall not have another Opportunity a great while for the Captain has sent Word he'll be here tomorrow without fail Accordingly he came with a roasted Pheasant and some boil'd Rice attended with another Bottle of  Greek  Wine  Notwithstanding my new Passion I eat and drank heartily but my Eunuch got almost tipsey and the Fumes of the Wine getting up into his Head he desir'd he might repose himself on my Bed for a while which I granted him well knowing if he had been found out we might both have suffer'd for tasting the Juice of the Grape I had much rather he had gone within the House to have slept for I could not even think to the purpose while he was there But he soon got into a sound Sleep which I found out by his Snoreing I then ventur'd to take Pen and Ink and wrote the following Lines  To the  English Lady  Madam  I  Have observ'd your melancholy Air and other Circumstances speak you a Prisoner here The Person that writes this is your Countryman and tho' in the same Distress yet has a Heart and Hand to do you Service I flatter my self it will one Time or other be in my Power to effect our Liberty If you have no Thoughts that way I am perswaded you have too much Generosity to do one a Prejudice that would venture any thing to serve you You know the Consequence if this Note should be discovered therefore I beg you would destroy it assoon as you have perus'd it and if you will favour me with an Answer with your Sentiments of what I have wrote you'll find a String hanging on the North Side of the Garden House  to which if you fix your Letter I shall be ready to prevent Discovery of what may hurt you and him whom you may freely command  I had not the Conveniency of Sealingwax or Wafer therefore I folded it up and directed it  To the  ENGLISH LADY When I had finish'd I began to have odd and confus'd Notions of the Success of it Perhaps said I to my self she may be contented with her Fortune or be afraid to hazard any Attempt towards her Liberty She may also imagine I am set on purpose to betray her and therefore to shew her Innocency may discover me to the Captain I was in a hundred Minds Sometimes I resolv'd to burn the Letter but at last Love prevail'd upon all my Reasons to the contrary and I resolv'd to try the Success of it the first Opportunity  In reasoning with my self and writing my Letter I had spent three Hours and therefore I thought it high time to awake my Eunuch who started up frighted out of his Senses When he had recover'd himself he thank'd me for breaking his Rest for he was assur'd he was wanted within And he nick'd his Time to a hair for before he was got half way the Walk for I immediately got up to my Peephole I saw the Ladies at the farther End He talk'd to them some time and then left them to go into the House  They saunter'd about the Garden a good while till at last two of them sat down by the Fountain and the  English  Lady continued her Walk towards my Apartment Now my Blood ran its swift Course and the whole Frame of my Body felt violent Emotions I thought this was a fair Opportunity and yet was fearful to make Use on't But mustring all my Spirits I ventured  and when she was within twenty Paces of the Greenhouse I darted the Letter and by good Fortune it fell in the Middle of the GravelWalk so that it was almost impossible to miss on't but had it happened otherwise I had time enough to run down and take it up before any one else could discover it She continued her Walk and when she came at it she kick'd it with her Foot once or twice and at last took it up She was reading in a Book as she was the Day before I could perceive her open it and spread the Note upon her Book so that no one could tell but that she was reading It is not possible to express the Anxiety I lay under all this while But I began to be a little more compos'd when I observed her tearing the Letter into very small Pieces and scattering them in several Places of the Garden She had not walk'd far but she return'd and view'd the Greenhouse with a great deal of Regard and to my Imagination wanted to come to the North Side of it as mention'd in the Note yet seem'd fearful often looking back and not fully confirmed in her Resolution at last went unwillingly to the rest of the Ladies This gave me some Hopes that she received the Letter kindly and that I should hear from her soon  I observed she sat by the Fountain very intent upon her Book which did not much please me In about a quarter of an Hour she got up and came towards the Greenhouse again When I saw her coming I ran down Stairs and fix'd a Packthread to the top of the Window for fear if she should take Courage and come to that Side not seeing the Packthread she might be startled and persuade her self there was nothing in't I had plac'd it and got to my Peephole before she had reached the South Side But  coming close to the Wall I could not see her by reason the smallness of the Hole cut off my Sight But in less than a Minute I discover'd her walking back again and sometimes turning to view the Place of my Retirement Assoon as she had got to the Top of the Walk for I had not Power to stir before I went down and pulling in the Packthread found a Piece of Paper ty'd to it I unty'd it with a great deal of Expectation and Impatience and found these Words wrote with a Pencil upon a clean Leaf of a Book which I suppose she had torn from that she had been reading in  I  Was much surprised when I perused a Note I found in the Walk of the Garden as believing it directed to me I confess I am a Person in Distress but know not how to take the Word of a Stranger and one I never saw who perhaps is no more than a Spy upon my Actions and what the Note contained may be by Order of him who pretends to tyrannize over me because I am in his Power and seeks this Way to find out my Inclination for Pretences to use me worse Therefore I'll expect a farther Assurance in half an Hour from the same Place And I'll take an Opportunity to convey my real Sentiments back again  The Joy I felt at reading this Note cannot be express'd in Words I sat me down and wrote the following Answer  MAdam to tell you my Motive to serve you may convince you of my Sincerity which I'll let alone till I have the Favour of speaking to you if ever I am so happy You have heard no doubt of the Person that the Master of this House brought from  Sallee  who is the same that is willing and proud to serve you▪ By him that dy'd upon the Cross for our  Sins I am sincere in what I write to you and if I cannot serve you it will be the greatest Grief can happen to one who shall ever be yours  R B  When I had wrote this I went to the usual Place and saw my Charmer very near me I threw it down as before she readily took it up and walk'd back again tearing the Note when she had read it as she did the former and went into the House Just as she was got within the Gate the other Eunuch came out not my friendly Eunuch and as he was walking along I observed him picking up the Pieces of the torn Notes If any one had observed my Countenance at this Action they might have discovered the utmost Confusion there I thought we were certainly undone and could not tell how to behave my self I sometimes repented of the Affair but yet I always found my Concern was more for her whom I lov'd than for my self Assoon as he had pick'd up all he could find he return'd with my hearty Curse and Wishes that he might be obliged to swallow them down his Throat for a Penance  I don't know when I should have recovered out of my fit of Confusion if the Sight of my Bliss had not done it She went to the Fountain sat her down upon the Margin and spent some time there then rose and made to my Apartment she took two or three Turns with a Book in her Hand but at last went out of Sight as before I staid till I saw her in the Walks again and then ran down where I found another writ with Ink as follows  I  Am convinc'd of your Sincerity and shall wholly rely upon your Endeavours to help me If we succeed and get our Liberty I have it in my Power to reward you when we arrive in  England  As we are two unhappy Persons I should not be displeased to see the Man that I own an Obligation to even in his Intention to serve me I have Liberty enough I mean as far as my Bounds and am not overclosely watched The Captain who took me Prisoner has hitherto us'd me very civilly and is only Troublesome when he tells me he loves me I have kept him from being too violent by shewing him a little Civility sometimes but how long he will continue within the Limits of Modesty I can't tell 'Tis that makes me dread his Presence and the sooner I am out of his Power the sooner I shall breath the Air of Content which is the Wish of  Your humble Servant  At the reading of this Paper my Heart ran oer with Contentment and had it not been for he Fear of what would happen about the Pieces  f the Letter that were pick'd up by the cursed Eunuch I should not have known how to have  ontain'd my Transports but the Thought of  at like Water on a Fire dampt my Joy I  ast my Time between Hopes and Fears till my  unuch came to sup with me I had torn my  etter into many Pieces and had dispos'd of all  e Fragments that had any Writing on it but  wo or three small Bits that were vacant of  ords lay under Feet As soon as ever my Eu  uch spy'd them he pick'd them up and said  did not do well to tread upon Paper for added  e if  Achmat  had seen you meaning the other  unuch he would have been in a strange Pas  on He has chid the Lady that my Master  ought home last very severely for throwing  Pieces of Paper about the Garden well knowing it could be only she that had don't because the rest were all  Mahometans  and know the Virtue of it I ask'd the Reason of all this Bustle about a Thing we  Europeans  put to the most servile Uses He told me with some Intreaty at last that all true  Mussulmen  have a great deal of Regard for Bits of Paper because the Name of God or their Prophet may be wrote upon it and they have a Tradition that when they are called out of Purgatory at the Day of Judgment to be Inhabitants of the everblessed Mansions there will be no other Way to come to their Prophet  Mahomet  but over a large redhot Iron Grate which they must walk over Barefoot And therefore upon the Instant as they are going to step upon the Grate all the Pieces of Paper they have pick'd up during their Residence in this World will run and place themselves of their own accord under their Feet so that they will be enabled to get to their Prophet without much Difficulty This whimsical Story set my Heart a  Rest and we sup'd chearfully emptied our Flas  of Wine which held two Quarts and took ou  Leaves I went to Bed and felt such a Calm i  my Mind that I did not lye long awake bu continu'd sleeping till ten aclock the next Day I was surpriz'd and vext I had rested so long when I consider'd perhaps that I had lost Sigh  of my Love I dress'd my self and took a Wal  in the Garden finding the Coast clear as  thought The Sun being pretty warm I retir'  to a little Shade made by a few Lawrel Trees but was much surpriz'd to find her that was eve  in my Thoughts sitting under the Shade in  thoughtful Posture She turn'd her Head at th  Noise I made in approaching her and was ru  ning away I pluck'd up with much ado Courage  enough to speak to her Madam said I I would not have you be under any Apprehension If I had known you had been here I would not have disturb'd you I will only inform you that I am the Person that has vow'd to serve you to the utmost of my Power Sir answered she I am not at all displeas'd at this Interview which is merely Chance on the contrary I am pleas'd to see the Person whom I once hope to be obliged to for my Liberty and wish we could often meet that we might consult about the Means Madam answered I if you'll condescend so far I don't doubt but to find Opportunities enough I told her of my Plot with the Eunuch and I had some Hopes it might produce something She approv'd of my Design and my Conduct hitherto She added that she would take hold of all Opportunities to walk in the Garden where I had inform'd her I could see her without being seen and so we parted for fear of being discover'd She went into the House and I went back to my Dwelling and in less than half an Hour the Captain arriv'd He came to fetch me to Dinner and told me I had work'd by Magick or I could never have done what I did He told me he thought himself much obliged to me and that I should find it I answered him I was convinc'd it was but my Duty to serve him with every thing in my Power and that if he pleas'd I would make farther Improvements He made me a great many Compliments his way and declared he would leave it to my better Judgment  By this time Dinner was ready and I was ordered to sit down at Table with him for tho' he had turn'd  Mahometan  yet he eat as we do in  Europe  not on the Ground upon Carpets as the  Asiatics  and  Africans  do We had our Dinner dressed  after the  English  Fashion and we drank plentifully of his  Greek  Wine He told me he had a Dispensation from the  Mufty  to drink Wine and smil'd I answered I believed the Crime was pardonable by  Mahomet  if it was drank with Moderation For my Part I don't think said I Religion consists in Castigation and Penance and I am convinc'd that an upright Man let him be  Jew Turk  or Christian may find his Way to Heaven We had several Discourses at Dinner about Religion but I soon discover'd the Captain knew very little of any and I am of the Opinion there's very few of the  Renegado's  think of Religion Their Motive to change is Ease and Interest But this is a Digression  When Dinner was over we walk'd in the Garden and I show'd the Captain what Improvements I had design'd to make He approv'd of every thing I said and inform'd me that he had heard from  Mirza  the Eunuch my Abhorrence of Women But he advis'd me to keep my Sentiments secret for when you abjure said he the  Moorish  Women will make you feel their Resentments But 'tis odd continu'd he that one of your Youth and Make should take such an Aversion to the Female Sex I told him I had very good Reasons for my Hatred and even my Mother was odious to me tho' she brought me into the World Well but added the Captain Time and a Fair Face may make great Alterations I told him I was very well assured I should carry my Resentment to the Grave I fancy said he I have an  English  Woman a Slave of mine that I have lately taken would make you change your Sentiments if you saw her Sir answered I I would be willing to stand the Tryal to convince you of the contrary tho' I would as soon look upon a Serpent with my Will  Well said he I have not learnt the Strictness of he  Moors  in keeping Women without being een or if I had your Aversion to them would onvince me I have not much to fear He desired me to walk awhile in the Garden and he would be with me again immediately Upon this  e left me and went into the House and re  urn'd in five Minutes Come said he I have order'd  y Women to walk in the Garden and you and will abscond behind these Lawrels where we  ay see them and not be seen We had not sat  ong before we could perceive three Women  oming towards us The two first were very  andsom a little inclining to Fat one seem'd to  e about thirty and the other twenty one accor  ing to my Guess and not so fair as our  English  Women but the third was she I look'd for All my Circumspection could not avoid my feeling a  udden flow of my Blood rise into my Face which my Captain observ'd Well said he when  hey were walk'd out of hearing I have taken Notice of your Disorder and perceive your real Aversion is unsurmountable which I am not sor  y for being it will add to your Liberty I have  o Occasion to have you confin'd when they walk in the Garden for I fancy added he laugh  ng you'll shun 'em fast enough Just answer'd  as I would a creeping Snake unless it were to  estroy 'em and that the Regard I have for you would prevent The last said the Captain is your Countrywoman one that I took in a Ship my  ast Voyage but one bound for the Island of  Zant  I lik'd her so well that I refused her Ransom that amounted to five hundred pounds  nd her Charms have overcome me so much that  would willingly enjoy her with her own Con  ent for Compulsion palls the Joy I have given  er twenty Days to consider on't and when that  Time's expir'd if she will not consent I am resolv'd to force her  Lord said I in a seeming Passion how can you take such an extraordinary Trouble for a thing that does not deserve the least Regard If the rest of the World were of your Mind said my Captain the Women would have but a scurvy Time on't Now 'tis to me amazing reply'd I that Men should take Pains live hard and run all Hazards to come home and spend all the Fruits of their Labour on such Trifles that perhaps have not the least Tenderness for 'em especially in these hot Counties where Women are given to be amorous and yet have but one Man to sometimes a Dozen of them and more when perhaps a dozen Men would hardly satisfy one Woman Why reply'd my Captain that's the Reason they are so strictly guarded we pretty well know what they expect Now if I had not had this Aversion to Women I return'd I have a Secret without Witchcraft to make a Woman doat upon a Man How said the Captain have you such a Secret if you'll let me know it I will not only give you your Liberty but amply reward you besides Sir said I I thank you but as for disclosing the Secret it is what I never can do yet 'tis in my Power to prepare you a chymical Liquid which put into Whitewine will do the Business though it will take up a great deal of Time and be very expensive As for the Expence reply'd the Captain I shan't value it But in how long Time can it be done Not under one hundred Days after Projection answer'd I Upon this he paus'd some Time A hundred Days is a great while yet I think 'tis better to wait for her Consent than to force her So far said I I think you are in the right and further added I you may continue  her Affection as long as you think fit by now and then adding some of the chymical Drops into any Liquid she shall drink after she has taken the first Prescription  The Captain seem'd mightily pleas'd with my Project and ask'd me what the Charge would be I answer'd I fear'd it would be about two hundred Pounds in this Country tho' it would be much cheaper in  England  where the things that I should want were easier to be had but I told him I could not give a just Account of the Charge till I saw the Prices of the Things I shou'd want I told him I was afraid I should find it a difficult thing to get a  Still  for that was the first thing I should want He answer'd me he did not question but I should easily procure every thing I wanted for Money and he would take care I should not stand in need of that He farther told me that several  Jews  in  Sallee  had all manner of Drugs and he believ'd every thing else that I should want For fear of the worst I told him I should not want my Drugs these fifty Days tho' I should want the  Still  immediately and Liberty to go into the neighbouring Woods in the Nighttime being there were several Herbs that I must gather by Moonlight and when the Moon was in its Full in the Increase or Decrease according to the Nature of the Herb I wanted He told me I should have all the Liberty I required not doubting I would make any wrong Use of it I told him to be more secure he might send who he thought fit to guard me No return'd he I'll leave you to your self But you may take who you will with you of my Servants if you want their Assistance I told him I should stand in need of some of 'em sometimes Well said he you shall go up with me and take what Money you have Occasion  for So accordingly we went into a little Closet where was a strong Box which he open'd and took out two hundred and fifty  Spanish  Pistoles said he if there is not enough you may have more I told him I was assur'd there was too much Well said he we'll reckon after the Affair is over And because it will be so long about I'll e'en take another cruising Voyage that I may not think the Time tedious I was very glad to hear him say so because I should have the better Opportunity to work my Design Tho' I dissembled my Joy and told him I should be sorry for that for I should often have something or other to give the Woman he design'd me to work upon Well said he  Mirza  shall take your Directions Upon saying this he call'd  Mirza  to us  Mirza  said the Captain you must observe this Person's Orders whatever he commands you to do you must obey with as much Exactness as if you were serving of me This he told  Mirza  in the  Moorish  Tongue but explain'd it to me in  English Mirza  also told me in  French  the Commission his Master had given him and farther added he hop'd I would often command him to visit the Wine Cellar I told him we would not want I advis'd the Captain to let me go to Town to enquire for the Still as soon as possible and to be known to those People that sold the Drugs Why if you will reply'd the Captain we'll go immediately upon which I consented He ordered a Horse to be sadled for me and I went into the Greenhouse to prepare my self and luckily for me I did for I found a Note fixed to the String which my fair Correspondent had taken Opportunity of leaving when she walked in the Garden by the Captain's Order The Contents were as follows  SIR  I  Take this Opportunity to acquaint you that the Tyrant Captain is arriv'd and has given me twenty Days to consent to his abominable Love I hope you will believe me when I tell you it has almost taken away my Senses The Time I fear is too short for us to effect our Laberty and if we do not succeed before the fatal Day I shall be the most miserable Wretch the Earth contains Let me hear from you and if you can give me the least Glimpse of Hope to lull my Sorrows fail not to chear the Heart of  Yours  How lucky was it for me to find this Note It might have fell into the Captain's Hands and then we had been in a fine Condition I had Time to write but a short Answer which I threw on the Ground and pull'd in my String it was this  Hope every Thing Write no more till tomorrow  I lock'd my Door and took the Key with me  When we were on Horseback our chief Discourse was concerning Charms Philtres and Witchcraft I convinc'd him there was not any such thing in the World and my Compound was the only thing that could do what was desir'd He ask'd me if I my self had ever try'd the Experiment I told him more than once and related the following Tale to him off hand  There liv'd in our Neighbourhood a rich old Man and very amorous but deformed to the last Degree He was roundshoulder'd broadfac'd bleareye'd shortnosed and his Mouth as wide as his Face was broad a pretty Object as one shou'd see This old Gentleman fell in Love with a very pretty Woman a Mercer's Daughter overagainst him  but seem'd to be the very Offspring of Pride and nothing less than a Lord shou'd be her Husband being well assur'd her Charms would conquer every one that look'd upon her She could not bear the thoughts of the old Gentleman and whenever he talk'd of his Passion treated him so ill that he was almost distracted I went to visit him one Day as I often us'd to do for before his LoveFit he was wont to be very good Company and would make as free with his Deformity as any Body else would do but I found him now in such a Condition that I began to pity him I us'd all the Arguments I was capable of to bring him to Reason but it was the same thing as to stem a Torrent At last I call'd to Mind this Elixir which I had never try'd before this Occasion I was pretty well convinc'd of its Virtue from what I saw it was compos'd of though the chief Ingredient is calcin'd Gold  This wonderful  Arcanum  was found out by an Uncle of mine that had studied the Secrets of Nature sixty Years When he was dying he call'd me to him and gave it me in Writing with the most sacred Conjuration that I should never reveal it nor cause it to be wrote till I thought my last Hour near and to destroy that which he gave me in ten Days for fear it should be found by Accident and that ten Days would be sufficient to imprint it in my Memory I give it into your Hands said my dying Uncle because I find thy Understanding exceeds thy Years and thy Aversion for Women will never let thee make an ill Use of the valuable Secret and further added that the Charge would deter me from doing it upon any slight Occasion I took it from him with a sacred Promise not to disclos  it till on my DeathBed for if my Uncle had  recover'd I must have deliver'd it up to him again But he expir'd in half an Hour  I so far pitied the old Gentleman and also having a Desire to try the Experiment that I told him I had it in my Power to make the Lady as fond of him as Love could wish if he would go to the Charge He told me he did not value the Expence but he had no Faith in Charms I convinc'd him at last went to work and accomplish'd my Affair The Quantity I made would serve a hundred Years and I had a Bottle in my Trunk when I was trepann'd aboard which if you had had the good Fortune to have taken would have sav'd you Time and Money  When I had brought my old Gentleman a Bottle of my Stuff he seem'd even then to have little Faith in it but I bad him have Patience till the Tryal All he had to do was to convey about forty Drops in a Glass of WhiteWine fasting That said he to me will be a difficult thing for I know she hates me neither will she stay in the Company where I am However I told him I would do my Endeavour to find an Opportunity So I order'd him to keep a small Bottle in his Breeches Pocket for it must be warm'd naturally with the Heat of the Person's Body that is to give it And in two or three Days I prevail'd upon a Relation of mine to invite the Lady to drink Tea with her I acquainted my old Lover that he should come in as by Accident and bring a Pint of WhiteWine as a Taste of a Parcel he was to dispose of Every Thing happen'd as desired the old Gentleman came in and got an Opportunity of conveying some of the Drops into a Glass of Wine and I had the Satisfaction of seeing her drink it This pass'd off and we parted But the poor Woman in less than ten Days was distractedly in Love with the  old Gentleman who took his Opportunity enjoy'd her and after despis'd her  Now the Nature of this Elixir is that if the Dose is not renew'd every time the Moon is in the full the Object belov'd will sink into dull Indifference again  My Captain told me he thought I might have made my Fortune by such a Secret I reply'd I had forgot to tell him that my Uncle made that one of his Articles that I should never sell a Drop of it and I assur'd him I would always keep my Promise  Our Story brought us to Town and I was very much pleas'd for I was both tir'd in inventing Lies to amuse him and riding after the  Moorish  manner with one's Knees almost to one's Mouth and there's no altering the Stirrups  We alighted at the Captain's House he sent about the Town and in an Hour bought a compleat  Still  He went with me to the Jew's that dispos'd of Drugs and by good Fortune and a good Memory I remembred the Names of a great many Sorts I laid out some Money then and told him I should want a great many other Sorts and larger Quantities Of this Jew I borrow'd a Crucible thro' the Captain's Interest to melt the Gold as I told him The things were order'd immediately to the Country House the Captain desir'd I would make no Delay so I return'd and got home just by Sunset I immediately ran to my Greenhouse to see if the Piece of Paper was there but I found it was gone this pleas'd me  I went to Bed and rose early in the Morning and seem'd to be very busie about the Garden I sent for my Eunuch out of the House and told him what I had undertaken for the Captain but I farther added if he did not now and then  give me his Company attended with a Bottle of the Juice of the Grape I could not possibly go through with my Undertaking He answer'd me smiling that he had Orders from his Master not to disobey me in any thing But added I I have a harder Task than all this for I am compell'd to have some Discourse with the Woman I am to work upon to find out her Temper for according to her Disposition I am to add or diminish several of my Ingredients Nothing could have prevail'd upon me continu'd I to have undertaken this hateful Task but the Hopes I have of Liberty for that is the Agreement between the Captain and me if I succeed in my Design which I am in no doubt of I should be glad return'd the Eunuch you might meet with what you desire yet I should be sorry to lose your good Company I shall with some Regret answer'd I part with you but Desire of Liberty and indeed of revenging my self on my unkind Uncle which is natural to us Mortals will make me as expeditious as I can in my Work I order'd him to let me have a Couple of Servants to go with me into the Fields that Night to carry the Herbs I should gather and he told me they should attend me  I now began to think of acquainting the Lady with some Part of my Design and therefore wrote her a Note to this Effect  Madam  I  Hope to have the Honour of conversing with you without Fear and even with the Consent of your Tyrant I have laid a Scheme for our Liberty that with the Blessing of God I hope will succeed You'll smile when I tell you I am to understand natural  Magic But I shall think nothing difficult if in the End I can serve one who may ever command  Yours  In less than an Hour I saw the Ladies coming down the Walk I ran immediately up to my Peephole and observed the Mistress of my Heart sauntring the same Way she us'd to go Assoon as I had discover'd her in the Walks again I ran down and found a Note in the room of mine at first I was uneasie imagining she had not taken mine away which contain'd to this purpose  I  Am something reviv'd at your short Sentence I found upon the Ground Yesterday I learnt your going to Town with the Captain by a Discourse between  Achmat  and  Mirza  for I understand the  Morisco  Tongue enough to pick out the Sense of what they say Yet I had not ventur'd to write for fear my Note should have miscarry'd if I had not seen you talking to  Mirza  out of my Window Only consider my Time is very short and if there is no other way to avoid the Captain I must fly to Death as my only Refuge Think of it and Farewell Let me have an Answer the soonest for Doubt and Expectation are but lingring Torments  I wrote her the following Answer  Madam  I'LL write to you no more and beg the Favour you wou'd desist from giving your self any farther Trouble I will have the Pleasure of talking to you openly tomorrow and let you into the whole Scheme I have laid for our Liberty But let me beg you to be chearful tho' reserv'd in your Countenance when we meet for fear we should be observ'd  She came to the old Place in an Hour after she had brought the last with another Note as she told me afterwards but reading mine she did not leave it behind her  After my Eunuch and I had din'd I went into the neighbouring Wood with two of the Captain's Slaves that were Blacks I loaded them with Herbs of several Sorts any thing I could lay my Hands on and order'd them to carry 'em into the Garden I had taken Care to tie every particular Herb with a String so that there was no Danger of mixing These I hung in Bundles upon the Branches of several Trees in the Garden and out we went again In short I gather'd a good Horseload of different Sorts and some I laid upon the Banks and others I cover'd with Earth that it look'd as if I was about Business I could hardly forbear smiling sometimes when alone notwithstanding my Anxiety for the Success of my Design to think how soon I drew in the credulous Captain Then I began to be in a thousand Fears of his discovering my Intention to some of the  Moorish  Physicians for tho' generally ignorant yet they would soon have found I was but an Impostor  While I was amidst my Fears the Captain arriv'd whose sight gave me some Trouble He came up to me looking about him at what I had done Why this looks like Work said he Yes Sir said I I am willing to begin that I may make an End the sooner But Sir I must intreat one Favour that you would not impart the Secret to any one of your Family but  Mirza  nor to no one else upon any Account whatsoever If they seem inquisitive tell 'em I am only distilling some simple Waters for your Closet I like your Advice answer'd the Captain and will be sure to follow it The Reason of my  coming down now was to take my Leave of you for I design to set Sail tomorrow Morning early for I am inform'd of a rich Vessel that will be in our Latitude in ten Days from a Prisoner that's lately taken belonging to  Spain  I can't tell how long I shall be out but I hope by that time I come back I shall find every thing in readiness Sir I return'd I don't fear but to accomplish my Design before you come back Well said he do you think you shall want any Thing else I told him nothing but now and then a Gallon of Sea Water Well said he I shall leave  Mustapha  behind me in Town who shall obey you in whatever you shall command Well said he Farewell and shook me by the Hand I'll just go in and give 'em a fresh Charge concerning you and then to Town again I was very glad to hear him say so and he was as good as his Word for in half an hour he took Horse He shook his Hand at me as he went by me and I heartily wish'd it might be the last Time we might see one another not as I could complain of my Treatment for he had us'd me very handsomely and if it had not been in regard to the Business of my Love I should not have wish'd him ill  Mirza  came to me and told me his Master had given 'em so strict a Charge to observe my Directions that if I had a mind to dispose of his Estate 'twas his own Fault for we must not disobey you Yes answer'd I if ever you find me requiring any thing foreign to this Affair I'll give you leave to deny me but there's one thing I must command you since I have the Power and that is to come and sup with me and bring some of the Nectar along with you for I am really fatigu'd with stooping and walking in the Sun when I gather'd those Herbs  Well return'd  Mirza  I believe I shall not find much Difficulty in obeying your Commands and I have one Favour to beg of you which is that you will lay your Injunctions on  Achmat  that he may partake Said I not today  Mirza  another time with all my Heart Nay reply'd  Mirza  it is not out of Love to  Achmat  that I desire it but that he may be as deep in Sin as my self for if he should ever discover me I can't tell the Consequence Well return'd I we'll find an Opportunity The Hour of Supper being come  Mirza  arriv'd with a couple of Flasks We eat and drank so heartily that  Mirza  was incapable of helping himself but was so inebriated with Wine that I began to repent of my plying him so fast I was forc'd to drag him and lay him on my Bed But how to conceal it from  Achmat  was my greatest Care for I did not doubt but he would be wanted and accordingly it so fell out For about twelve aclock at Night he came and knock'd at my Door I was up and thinking of my Design I open'd the Door and understood by his Signs that he wanted  Mirza  I let him know by Signs that I had sent him to gather me some Herbs by Moonlight He was satisfy'd and went back again Now  Mirza  kept the Key of the Gate so that my Story was feazable enough  About four aclock in the Morning  Mirza  wak'd but frighted out of his Wits to find it Morning tho' I soon compos'd him by letting him understand how I had manag'd  Achmat  He return'd me a thousand Thanks and told me he should never be able to make me amends I ask'd him how I shou'd order it to see this Woman for I could not go to Work till I had convers'd with her And yet by Heaven and  Paradise said I I shall be more concern'd at the Interview than at any thing which ever happen'd to me and that was but Truth for my Mind was perplex'd between Hope and Fear Joy and Anxiety I pity you indeed said  Mirza  and I wish I cou'd any way ease you of the Trouble Well said I then let her come alone into the Garden as I am sprinkling my Herbs by and by for I think one Woman is enough to plague a Man Oh said  Mirza  all Men are not of your Mind But I'll leave you and hope to find you in better Humour when I see you again  I had order'd a Slave to bring me some Water and a large Quantity of Salt to mix with it only to amuse 'em With this I sprinkled the Herbs I had gather'd and I was very busy about nothing  I saw presently after the Idol of my Soul and  Mirza  running before her When he was near enough to me to be heard he said I must beg you to excuse my waiting on you for a little while for my not being in the House last Night as usual has let my Business so encrease upon my Hands that I must make use of all Opportunities to regain lost Time I told him I would not be his Hindrance but was very sorry I could not have his Presence upon this Occasion for I should be in a very great Dilemma He made me no Answer being the Lady was within hearing but return'd into the House  Assoon as the Coast was clear I accosted her with a great deal of Timerity Madam said I the happy Time is come that I may tell you without Fear or Danger how much you may command me Sir return'd she I am convinc'd of your sincere Desire to serve me and as I have wrote to you in one of my Notes if  Heaven prospers our Wishes and we arrive safely in  England  I hope it will be in my Power to reward you Madam said I the Success will amply reward me for all my Trouble and as one Climate gave us Birth it is my Duty to do all I can to serve you if I had no other Motive But if you please let us consult now we have Time by the Forelock how we shall order our Affairs Sir reply'd the Lady I am convinc'd your Understanding wants not to be instructed and if you please I'll be rull'd by you in every thing Madam said I have you any Objection to be disguis'd in the Habit of a Man for added I we may so accomplish our Liberty with more ease I have no Objection to it answer'd the Lady but how will you procure it Please to leave that to me I return'd and in less than ten Days I hope we shall be out of Danger I then inform'd her of the Scheme I had laid which she mightily approv'd and told me she thought my Understanding outwent my Years I told her some Accidents in Life new edg'd our Thoughts and if we succeeded the Inspiration came from her I observ'd she blush'd at my Discourse yet did not look as if she took ll what I had said But I was much concern'd to see her change the Discourse I did not think  t proper to declare my self any further hoping when I had affected her Liberty Gratitude would befriend me in her Heart I observ'd by her Conversation she had a large share of Understanding and a happy turn of Wit In short this  nterview had fix'd my Heart intirely hers I had  everal times thought of inquiring into her Forune and how she was brought into her unhappy Slavery but desisted till we had more Lei  ure She told me she fear'd we should make  ur Conversation too long not said she with a  Look that shot through my Heart as I am oppress'd with your Company but for fear we may be observ'd I told her I believ'd we should not have many more Opportunities therefore I begg'd her to be ready in a few Days to leave this hateful Place She answered me that she would wait with some Impatience my Commands and any Hour should find her in Readiness She farther added that she wish'd she might be as ready and as willing at her last Call I begg'd her to cast off all melancholy Thoughts and trust to Providence Upon which we parted with this her Answer that she was ever resign'd to the Will of Heaven and whatever should happen she would do her Endeavour to make her self easy even if it was the Miscarriage of our Design  When she was gone I soon found the Sight of her encreas'd my Passion if it was possible for Love like mine to suffer Augmentation But it was Love alone that work'd Miracles of old it was Love that rous'd me from supine Slavery for I must own once more if it had not been for this fated Passion I should never have attempted any thing to regain my Liberty But even my Love slumber'd now and then that industrious Diligence might wake and I was resolv'd to put the Design in Execution with all the Expedition imaginable for fear of Accidents I went on amusing the House with Variety of Works for my Preparation and I was continually ordering the Slaves to Town▪ for one thing or other to strengthen their Opinion  Mirza  came to me soon after At his Approach▪ I did my endeavour to put on a Countenance with little satissaction of Mind but I am apt to believe I did it but aukwardly For as the Face is the  Index of the Mind I am of Opinion a Person of nice Judgment and Observation may discover a false Passion with as much ease as a Jeweller would distinguish the different Species of Stones if we may call them so Well said  Mirza  your fiery Tryal is over but I perceive by your Countenance your Chagrine would willingly wear off if you'd but suffer it Why truly said I I have two different Passions strugling in my Mind that is Joy and Grief I am pleas'd to think I shall succeed in the Affair I have undertaken and yet griev'd that I must be compell'd to suffer the Torment I endure to help the Operation Consider the Reward reply'd  Mirza  that is to follow I chang'd the Discourse that I might not be put to the Trouble to speak against my Conscience any longer I told him I should be obliged to go to Town for Saltwater out of the Sea and other Necessaries that I should stay for Why reply'd  Mirza  you may send for Saltwater without being at the Trouble of going your self I told him I was obliged to go in Person because I was to take it out of the Sea when the Sun was in a particular Altitude Nay return'd  Mirza  I am only concern'd upon my own Account for I have engag'd  Achmat  to dine with you today with a great deal of Trouble Well return'd I I will not disappoint you I'll stay one Day longer to oblige you He return'd me many Thanks for my Condescension and went into the House to prepare Things accordingly  All the while he was absent I was contriving my Scheme When Dinner was ready  Mirza  brought it in accompany'd with  Achmat  He had taken Care at several Times to bring Wine and had plac'd it in a Vault in the Greenhouse  Achmat  made his  Moorish  Honours and we all  sat down  Mirza  beg'd I would call the Wine a Cordial that the Captain had given me But I might have call'd it what Name I would for  Achmat  did not understand me for  Mirza  was my Interpreter and with much Persuasion we prevail'd upon him to taste it But when he had drank one Glass he seem'd to like it mightily and soon ask'd for another and in short ply'd his Hand to his Head so often that he was oblig'd to get up and play'd such Pranks danc'd and sung and roll'd about that it put us in a Fright for fear some one should hear the Noise he made Which to remedy I made him drink more till at last he dropt down and fell asleep We laid him upon my Bed and did not intend to disturb him  I told  Mirza  now we had accomplish'd this great Affair I had a mind to go to Town even then for the Sun shone and perhaps it might not the next Day and I was willing to take the first favourable Opportunity He told me what I pleas'd now the Jobb was done Accordingly Horses and Slaves were provided me and away I went for  Sallee  When I came to Town I found  Mustapha  at home who congratulated me with the Favour I had receiv'd from his Master and farther added that he had given him full Charge to obey me in whatever I should command I told him I should want his Assistance immediately with a small Boat only he and I and I begg'd him to take his Quadrant with him for I should want his Art a little We took the Boat he had provided me and row'd out of the Bay till we came to a small Promontory where I desir'd him to take the Elevation of the Pole When he had so done we lav'd Water into a Vessel we brought for that purpose and went home again From thence I went to the  Jew's and begg'd he would furnish me with a  Moorish  Habit for my present Wear for the People of the Country do so stare at me said I being in a different Dress from them that it makes me asham'd He provided me with a very handsome one which I had pack'd up carefully that no one should observe what it was I bought several Trifles of him that I had no occasion for and at several Times other rich Habits but one thing particularly that I hop'd I should want which was a Pint of liquid  Laudanum  I went to  Mustapha  and order'd my things to be got ready While that was doing I endeavour'd to sound him to know whether he had any Thoughts about his Liberty for I remembred at our first Meeting he declar'd himself as I thought very frankly But in all his Discourse now I found him of a wavering uncertain Temper and therefore I thought it the wisest way to keep my Design to my self and go another way to work I took my leave of him and went home I unloaded my Horses and took particular Care of my Bundle of Things My Salt Water I put into shallow Pans in the Sun which in a Day's time produc'd small Quantities of Salt I did not want to try Experiments yet I was pleas'd to see the Operations  I began to set my  Still  on Work the next Day but was soon interrupted in my Progress by the hasty Arrival of  Mirza  Said he we have brought a fine House upon our Heads yonder's  Achmat  won't be contented without more of the  Francks  Cordial the  Moors  call all  Europeans Francks  I ask'd him how he order'd him when he wak'd after I had left 'em he told me he was so greedy after the precious Liquor that he drain'd the empty Bottles and he believ'd if  Mahomet  himself had made him a Visit and  Achmat  had got a Bottle to his Nose he would not have bid him welcome till he had seen the Bottom Well said I you know the Liquor is not mine but I'll stand by you in the Consumption of it Well if you please then said  Mirza  we'll trouble you with our Company tonight With all my Heart said I so we agreed to sup together  Mirza  farther added that the Ladies had a mind to see my  Still  at work I told him they might do as they thought fit but I would get out of the Way and accordingly he went to fetch them The  Moorish  Women came down the Walk in a hasty manner to observe it but the  English  Lady came alone as usual I had got on the other Side of the Lawrel Trees and took Care to appear in her Sight Assoon as she saw me she cautiously approach'd me and told me softly she wanted to have a little Talk with me I answer'd her we had an Opportunity very favourable and then let her know how the other Women were employ'd beside we had the Lawrel Walk between us and I was out of Sight from every Body else She told me she had something particular to mention to me said she we shall certainly want Money to accommodate us with many Necessaries in our dangerous Voyage I told her what Money I had sav'd for our Design but that we should certainly have Occasion for more if we were oblig'd to go for  Spain  That was one of the Reasons said she why I wanted to confer with you It is in my Power to procure a considerable Sum and tho' it is not so much as I have lost by the Captain yet I have even a Scruple to take clandestinely from him what I may say is my own justly I soon remov'd her Scruples and then she farther told me what was in her Power to take  was chiefly in Jewels which would be better for Concealment and Carriage than Money By this time she observ'd the other Ladies coming towards her which she inform'd me of upon that I took my leave and absconded When they were gone off the Walks  Mirza  came to me to release me as he call'd it and told me the Ladies were mighty well pleas'd with the View of my Work and Materials I told him I hop'd they would not give me that Trouble often He answer'd he would take Care for the future  Now the Crisis of my Project was very near I went to Town the next Day and took  Mustapha  for more Water and farther added I should want him a Night or two hence to procure Water by Moonlight He wonder'd at my Proceeding but his Master had told him that I was something very extraordinary and suspected me of Magick but he also inform'd him that I was using my Art for his Benefit I told him I had several Materials to wash in the Sea Water in the Full of the Moon which was at that time and then I should give him no farther Trouble From thence I went to my Jew's again and privately procur'd several sorts of dry'd Provisions as Neats Tongues Biskets dry'd Fish Wine and a small Puncheon of Water and several other Necessaries all to be ready at a Moment's Warning  When I had provided every thing I went home again and got an Opportunity the same Day to speak with my Mistress I desir'd she would be ready about twelve aclock at Night with every thing she had a mind to take with her She told me she could not tell how to escape the Vigilance of the Eunuchs for said she they lock me up every Night when they  go to Bed nay every Day when they are not with me I desir'd her to leave that to me I invited  Mirza  and  Achmat  to sup with me that Night for I told 'em I was oblig'd to sit up to watch my Work being it was coming to a Head and that I was to go to Town before Day They comply'd with my Request with a great deal of Joy and the Hour drawing near they lock'd up the Doors of the House and came with a great deal of Contentment in their Looks We sat down and I ply'd them with Wine till they thought they had enough For the finishing Stroke I desir'd 'em to drink one Cup of a Liquor of my own distilling which they soon comply'd with I went and fetch'd a Bottle of Brandy that I had procur'd on purpose in which I had convey'd a large Quantity of  Laudanum  to be ready for this Occasion I gave 'em each a good large Cup which they swallow'd but did not very well like the Taste I told them I had distill'd that Liquor on purpose to keep the Fumes of the Wine or  Cordial  as  Achmat  would have it out of the Head They were very well pleas'd if it would have that Effect yet desir'd another Glass of Wine to put the Taste out of their Mouths which I comply'd with The Liquor soon had its desir'd Effect and a profound Sleep lock'd up all their Senses I with some Fear took the Keys out of  Achmat  's Pocket and went directly to the House and at last found the right Key that open'd the Place where my Treasure was repos'd Tho' she found her self at Liberty yet she shook with timerous Apprehensions I encourag'd her all I could and brought her the Disguise which I had provided for her While she was getting ready I retir'd out of Decency and got out my Horses and an  Italian  Slave whom I had two or three times  taken to Town with me He understood a little  French  and I had observ'd something in his Countenance that spoke him worthy of a better Fate I had not once mention'd to him any thing of my Project for fear of any Accident but I had order'd him to be ready to go with me that Night When I came back I found my Mistress ready and something impatient I inform'd her she must submit to another Disguise She ask'd me what that was I took out a Paper of  Ombre  and told her she must permit me to rub it over her Face and Hands which I did But the Pleasure of touching her Flesh in that gentle manner perfectly put me in an Ecstasy which she observ'd for I could not help softly squeezing her Hand She did not seem displeas'd at my Transport but yet I thought the Occasion she had to make Use of me made her bear with me Assoon as we were ready we went out but I first lock'd the Doors and left 'em as I found 'em My Mind was confus'd between Hope Fear Joy and Terror and I did not doubt but the Lady was in a worse Condition but all my Task was to comfort her When I had help'd her up on Horseback I call'd for the  Italian  Slave and we both mounted for I would not let him walk on Foot as usual  When we were got safe from the House I began to ask the  Italian  Slave several Questions as where he was born how long he had been a Slave and so forth I found by his Answers that he had no Hopes of Liberty for he had sent several Letters to his Friends in  Italy  and never could receive any Answer Then I began to come nearer the matter and gave him some Hint of our Design but with this Addition even Death should not deter me from the Execution  He had hardly Patience to hear me out but begg'd he might share the same Fate with me and if he got his Liberty through my Means he should never forget the Obligation but I might be Master of that Life I should be the Means of saving for added he to live in Slavery is but to be always dying the worst of Deaths I soon found by his manner of expressing himself that he was sincere in what he said At last I told him all my Design which he mightily approv'd of and said every thing was so well concerted that with the Blessing of God it could not miscarry  When we arriv'd at the Captain's Town House we found  Mustapha  waiting for me I had consider'd we could not do without him yet I would not venture to mention our Escape till we had him safe upon the Sea I order'd every thing into the Boat and to hide my disguis'd Lady I told  Mustapha  that it was a young Gentleman that had been bit by a mad Dog and I had brought him to dip him in the Sea by the Desire of his Friends that liv'd in the Neighbourhood in the Country which was allow'd to be the only Cure  When we had gain'd the main Sea I began to open my Design to  Mustapha  but was something surpriz'd to hear him call out for Help I immediately drew a Pistol out of my Pocket for I had procur'd several Pair held it to his Breast and threaten'd him with Death that Moment if he offer'd to open his Mouth I added that we had gone too far to stop now and I believe if he had made any Resistance I should certainly have dispatch'd him When he found Resistance would signify nothing he sat him down and wept bitterly I was really sorry to see him so much afflicted and comforted  him all I could and to encourage him I told him assoon as we arriv'd at  Magazan  a strong Port belonging to the  Portuguese  upon the  Afric  Coast where I had design'd to steer our Course he should not only have his Liberty but I would reward him with fifty Pistoles for the Pains he should be at I further added I would not have given him this Trouble if I could have found a possibility of doing without him He seem'd to be satisfied and promis'd us all the Help he could I told him we would make the best of our way to  Magazan  not being above twenty Leagues South of  Sallee  He seem'd very much pleas'd our Voyage was to be so short for the Wind was fair and we hop'd to arrive at  Magazan  in two Days at the farthest I had provided every thing that was necessary for a much longer Voyage and when we had directed our Course and were settled in our Way I desir'd the Lady to take some Refreshment and compose her unsettled Thoughts▪ for we were now out of all manner of Danger I said this only to comfort her for I was even in fear of the Captain's Ship or some other  Moorish  Vessel meeting us by Chance and the  Italian  put into my Head another Fear that as I had declar'd I was never at  Magazan  nor did not know where it was situated he was not assur'd but  Mustapha  might steer his Course to some Place that was possess'd by the  Moors  I gave  Mustapha  a Hint of it with a Promise of a quick Dispatch if he betray'd us But he assur'd me there was never another Port between that and  Magazan  After we had refresh'd our selves I intreated the Lady to acquaint us how she came into the Power of the Captain Now we are something at Ease said she obligingly I shall inform you with Pleasure  THE HISTORY OF Mrs  VILLARS  _MY Father's Name was  Villars  an eminent Merchant of the City of  Bristol  My Mother dy'd when I was very young so that I could never know the Loss of her The Care of my Father atton'd for the Want of my Mother He gave me all the Education that was proper to our Sex but before I was Sixteen my Father dy'd The Grief and Sorrow I felt for his Death was not recompens'd by an Estate of two thousand Pounds a Year which he left intirely at my own Disposal besides several valuable Jewels of my Mother's My Fortune I suppose brought me many Admirers but as I was a Stranger to Love I had no Inclination to marry Yet being pester'd so much with their Company and Courtship I retir'd to a Country House near the Sea Side and as I did not care to see any of my Suitors so whenever they came I always left Word I was gone abroad or out of Order and in a little time I got clear of their Impertinence  I had the Misfortune to be a Woman of Business tho' young for my Father had several  Vessels at Sea The Captain of one of the Ships that traded to  Turky  brought me a Bill of Lading and I happen'd to please him tho' more than I knew till afterwards In short he fell desperately in Love with me but hearing my Aversion to Matrimony never declar'd his Passion to me yet by Bribes and Presents gain'd over to his Interest a Maid that liv'd with me who for a hundred Pound had plac'd him in a Closet in my Bedchamber I came and undress'd my self as Usual and went to Rest But I had not been long laid ere I found a Person pulling down the Cloaths and attempting to come to Bed to me I was prodigiously surpriz'd and frighten'd as any one would imagine I call'd for Help but no one came to my Assistance for the Maid had taken Care of that I got out of Bed with much ado and attempted to open the Door but found I was lock'd in I us'd Intreaties to the Wretch who was disguis'd in such a manner that I could not know him for he had got a Mask on but all to no purpose He seiz'd me and I was so faint with Struggling that he was very near accomplishing his barbarous Design when my other Closet Door flew open for I had one at each End of the Room and there came out another Man disguis'd My Fear could not be well increas'd but I was in such a Terror that I did not well know whether I was really alive  The Person who came out last seiz'd immediately on the other who let me go to defend himself I ran to the Door and Fear adding to my Strength I burst it open but how or which way I cannot remember I ran to the Maid's Chamber and the Noise and Confusion we were in alarm'd the Men Servants I had slipt on a Gown and when I had got all the Men together  I told 'em the Reason of this Alarm They immediately arm'd themselves and ran up to my Chamber but the Persons were both gone In searching the Room we found a Piece of a Mask on the Ground and a Handkerchief mark'd  L K  with Stains of Blood in several Parts of the Room We could not imagine who they were and I was so very much confus'd and frighten'd that I did not examine the Bottom of it that Night but went to Bed in another Room very ill with the Fright though not before I had given Order to two of my Men Servants to watch at my Chamber Door  I search'd the Closets of that other Room and under the Bed before I wou'd venture And it being a Room where my Father us'd to lye it had a Bar on the Inside so I and my Maid went to Bed Notwithstanding my Fatigue Frights and Fears I fell asleep and when I woke in the Morning found my self very well I began then to think reasonably of my last Night's Adventure and easily judg'd that one or both of my Maids must be in the Confederacy for my Door never us'd to be lock'd on the Outside before I sent for all my Servants up Men and Maids and related to 'em the Night's Adventure But they brought me Word that Mrs  Susan  was not to be found I sent to examine her Room but I was inform'd all her things were gone We all concluded that she was the Occasion of the last Night's Plot I did not think fit to send after her rejoycing I had escap'd such a base Conspiracy till going up into my own Chamber I found a Diamond Necklace a Ring my Gold Watch and about sixty Guineas in Money taken away my Escritore broke open and a Bill of five hundred Pounds that  was due taken away I immediately sent to  Bristol  to stop Payment but was told that my Maid had come as from me for the Money and had receiv'd it several Hours before We made the strictest Search we could for her but all to no Purpose So I gave it all for lost Six Weeks pass'd on and no News concerning my Maid One Morning as I was walking in my Garden a Sailor brought me a Letter which was to this Purpose  Madam  I  Heartily repent of my Infidelity to you When I committed that base Action I took Shelter on Board of a Ship that belongs to my Brother and now lies about six Miles off where the Bearer will conduct your Ladyship if you will be so good to come away immediately The Reason of my Repentance and Sorrow tho' a sincere one is at the Approach of Death by the Accident of a Fall down the Hold of the Ship where I broke my left Leg and fractur'd my Scull so that I have been senseless for two Days But God granting me my Senses again tho' with the Information that I can't live four and twenty Hours has through his Mercy convino'd me that to expect Pardon from him is to restore what is yours with a sincere Confession of the fatal Night's Adventure that corrupted my Honesty and will be the Cause of my Death And farther if Heaven will grant me the Blessing of seeing you I may put you in a Way to prevent something of Ill that may happen to you  Your Repenting Servant Susan Prichard  P S  I beg you to keep it Private and to amuse your Servants that you bring with you you may tell 'em you are going on Board the  Turky  Ship to see the Present the  Turky  Merchants are  sending to the Emperor of  Constantinople  The Bearer will conduct you  Now I had heard of one of the  Turky  Fleet that was obliged to put into the Road by a violent Storm And that it had a Sedan made with Lookingglass of a very curious Workmanship design'd for a Present to the  Turkish  Emperor I ask'd the Sailor several Questions concerning the Letter and he answer'd me bluntly he could not tell any thing about it but that there was a young Woman who had fell down their Hold and had almost kill'd her self and that they did not expect she could ever recover I resolv'd to go along with him but to take two Men Servants and a Maid with me I walk'd to the Waterside which was about a quarter of a Mile from my House and there I found a Ship's Boat with eight Oars and very handsome I stept into it with my Servants without any Hesitation and put off In about an Hour and a half we came along side of the Vessel they mann'd Side for me and I was handed up and led into the Cabin where I found my Maid upon a PallatBed in one Corner of it Assoon as she saw me she attempted to rise but seem'd not to have Strength enough and fell down again I desir'd she would not put her self to any Pain but compose her Thoughts that she might be the better able to inform me of what she had promis'd me in her Letter O Madam she cry'd with Hesitations Sighs and ready to faint every Moment you do not know what I feel at the Sight of you You bring into my Remembrance the Transaction of that fearful Night but I hope your Goodness will forgive me I shall put into your Hands what I have wickedly  robb'd you of and since I am going out of this World I am assur'd your Goodnature will prevail for my Pardon I told her I forgave her freely and I hop'd Heav'n would do so too She thank'd me but said she found her self so Ill that she intreated leave to rest from speaking a Minute or two to gather a little Breath  I waited with some Impatience but she remain'd so long silent that I really thought she was expir'd Upon that Supposition I call'd to her and she answer'd me but faintly Well Madam said she as I find you impatient to know what I have promis'd you I will tell you as well as I am able  Captain  Bourn  had for many Months a great Passion for you but finding you averse to Matrimony he tamper'd with me and offer'd me such large Sums of Money that beat down all my guard of Honesty and overcame it quite He gave me a hundred Pounds besides other valuable Presents to admit him into your Closet before you went tobed which accordingly dazled with the lustre of the Gold I did You know what follow'd and if he had not been prevented by the sudden Appearance of another Person out of the other Closet would have compass'd his Design Said I eagerly pray do you know who the other Person was Yes Madam return'd the Wench it was Mr  Lawrence Kendrick  your former Suitor and Guardian convey'd there for the same base Intent by your Ladyship's Woman How cry'd I amaz'd are you assur'd of that Madam pursu'd she when you got out of the Door Mr  Kendrick  seiz'd upon Mr  Bourn  and they struggled together some time but Mr  Kendrik  's Mask falling off Captain  Bourn  knowing him cry'd Is it you In short they soon came to an Ecclaircisement and went down Stairs unperceiv'd  by any of us in the Hurry Where he declar'd to the Captain that he had prevail'd upon Mrs  Ellis  your Woman for a good Sum of Money to convey him into the Closet which she did unperceiv'd of any Thus said I may ill Intentions be ever frustrated  When she had finish'd she begg'd me to have a little more Patience while she got a little more Strength and she would restore me my Money and Jewels I was unwilling to wait long yet thought fifteen hundred Pounds too much to lose for my Necklace Ring and Watch were valued by my Father at a thousand Pounds I believe I had been full three Hours on Board and wanted to be at Home again and after she had kept silent some time I made bold to disturb her once more I call'd to her and told her I had a great Way to go and I was afraid of catching cold She begg'd I would ring a Bell that hung by my Hand which I did and the Sailor came in that brought me the Letter Pray said the Maid is my Brother ready to come in Yes answer'd he and has been on Board this half Hour It's very well said she Upon that she rais'd her Hand and unpinn'd a Shutter that fell down and let Light enough into the Cabin which was dark before but I thought her Illness was the Reason of that But to my eternal Amazement I saw her rise from the Pallate as well as ever I saw her in my Life Before I had Power to speak Captain  Bourn  enter'd I could not presently dive into this Mystery I hope Captain said I at last that you repent of your rash and bold Attempt Yes Madam answer'd he that I did not succeed in't but I hope I have it now in my Power to finish my Design I askt him what he meant He told me I should soon be inform'd  and if I would not consent to his Embraces he would certainly ravish me that very Night Upon this Treatment I began to call for my Servants but the faithless  Susan  told me they were taken care of and safe ashore Yes Madam return'd the Captain they are twelve Miles behind us by this Time and desir'd I would look out of the Cabin Window which they had just before open'd I cast my Eyes behind me and too soon perceiv'd that we were a considerable Distance from the Land I did not look long for the Sight took away my Senses and I fell down in a Swoon and when I came to my self it was far in Night but I was so faint and ill that my feeble Limbs would not support my Body Grief attack'd me so violently that it was thought by every body it would soon overcome me By next Morning a strong Feaver seiz'd me and all that I remember'd for six Weeks was that I was put to Bed with the Wretch that betray'd me to attend me But the Condition I was in really wrought upon her and produc'd a true Conversion She lamented more than I and curs'd her self a thousand times  When I had recover'd my Senses I was wore away to a Skeleton And sure never any one in my Condition found any Relief but Death But it pleas'd the Divine Being to work another Miracle and insensibly restore me to my former health of Body but a Mind involv'd in the most cruel Torture past Imagination  When I found the Maid's Repentance real I freely forgave her The Captain in all this Time had never come near me but only to enquire after my Health as  Susan  inform'd me But when he perceiv'd I had regain'd my former Health and Beauty as he call'd it I was tormented with his beastly Addresses He told me  if I would consent to marry him and forgive the Crime he was guilty of he would immediately steer for  England  which he could reach in a few Days I consider'd I was in a Wretch's Power who by what he had done already would stick at nothing to gain his Ends I therefore resolv'd to flatter him by the Advice of my Maid who notwithstanding she had brought me into these Distresses I had taken into my former Favour In one of his troublesome Visits I told him if he would immediately restore me to my Liberty I would upon the Instant make him my Husband when we could procure a proper Person to tye the Knot He answer'd me that the only way to secure me to him was to have Possession of my Body beforehand and continu'd he if you think the Action criminal I'll soon cure your Conscience by the Licence of the Church For said he if you intend what you propose you will easily comply and nothing else will convince me of your Sincerity I'll give you one Day to consider on't but continu'd the Wretch if you refuse to submit by fair Means I tomorrow by Force will enjoy you So I leave you to consider on't and saying this left us in the Cabin I had desir'd  Susan  to conceal our Reconcilement from the Captain which she artfully had done and in his Discourse would often throw in a Word or two in his behalf  When we were alone I gave my self over to my Sorrows and thought of nothing for several Hours but my unhappy Circumstances We both continu'd silent a considerable time Nor indeed had I Power to speak tho' Heav'n had indu'd me with that Fortitude that I had resolv'd sooner to die than to submit to his curs'd Proposals I told  Susan  that I had determin'd  to put an end to all my Sorrows by Death and when that fatal Hour arriv'd of his limitted Time I would plung a Knife I had conceal'd for that Design into my Bosom This Resolution once more renew'd our Griefs and we mingled Tears together We wept so much that the Fountains of our Eyes were dry and we again remain'd silent At last  Susan  broke it with a Speech to this Purpose  Madam in the Confusion of my Thoughts I have chose out one that has some Probability of Success but it will at least convince you of my Repentance and the Desire I have to restore you that Peace I have barbarously broke The Captain yet thinks me in his Interest and if we can contrive it I'll submit to his loath'd Embraces in your Room which shall be manag'd in this Manner You shall treat with him upon't tomorrow Morning The Articles shall be these First that he come in the Dark and stay no longer than one Hour with you and last that he shall not repeat your Familiarity till you are join'd by the Priest  I must confess this Proposal gave me a dawn of Hope and if we could but succeed in't I should not fear his farther Passion when we were landed For I knew it was easy to find Protection when once on Shore in  England  and I thought the Contrivance feazible enough for we were much of the same Age and no perceiv'd Difference in our Make at least in the Dark  She left it to me to manage And I resolv'd to put on a more compos'd Countenance at the Captain's next Visit which was soon after tho' he had given me longer Time to consider When he came in he begg'd my Pardon for interrupting me but he came to make me a Present  he said and put a little Box in my Hand desiring I would open it which I did where I found my Jewels and Money I restore you that Madam continu'd he and would not willingly be oblig'd to you for any thing but your Person and even all your Fortune shall be at your own Disposal and the Moment you consent to my Desires I'll deliver you a Paper that shall oblige me to sign whatever Terms you shall think fit to make me I paus'd a short time but indeed it was to think what my Tongue should utter so foreign to my Heart  Captain said I you take the only Way to gain your Point and I must confess this Shew of Generosity tho' it's in your Power to force 'em from me again seems a little to lessen the ill Opinion I have Reason to bear against you If you'll please to allow me one half Hour to think a little I'll give you my final Answer tonight He seem'd very much overjoy'd at my Discourse and shew'd it in an extravagant unpolite manner thank'd me and went out  I did not want that time to prepare what I had to say but I thought it was better than to come into it on a sudden The time expir'd the Captain came in with an expecting Face I bad him sit down which I found by his Countenance he took as a good Prologue Sir said I I have fully considered every thing and if you will comply with a few Articles you shall have Possession of what you desire tonight Articles Madam I'll sign to a Blank reply'd the Brute if you please I told him they were only verbal ones First said I I'll have no Light in the Room secondly you shall stay with me but an Hour and lastly never to expect any more Favours till we are lawfully marry'd Madam return'd the Captain you so overjoy me that I don't know  where I am I'll comply with all your Articles and you have made me the happiest of Mankind He said a great deal more fulsome Stuff that was as nauseous to my Ears as a Plaguesore to the Sight He left us with a Hope I would not long defer his Happiness It was well I was in a dark Corner of the Cabin for had I been in the Light he would have perceiv'd the Confusion in my Countenance  The hated Hour drew near and  Susan  with a sincere Grief and Tears running down her Cheeks laid her self in the Captain's loathed Bed I was really griev'd at the Sacrifice she was going to make me for I was convinc'd she had no loose Desires about her The Captain enter'd in the Dark and was as happy as a false Imagination could make him I must confess I was in a thousand Frights and Fears lest the Girl should have been discovered but every thing succeeded too well and the Captain rose within his limited time and went out  Assoon as he was gone the poor Creature got up from her guilty Scene Well Madam said she all drown'd in Tears I hope I have convinc'd you tho' to my eternal Cost of my Repentance and Sincerity but I hope Heaven will pardon me and not lay the Crime to me or you when fatal Necessity was the only Cause I gave her all the Comfort I was capable of and told her I did not think it impossible to oblige him to marry her when we had him in our Power on Shore and that Formality would obliterate all melancholy Thoughts How reply'd  Susan  No Madam tho' I have done all this yet it was only to serve you and before I would be his Wife or indeed any Man's Wife I would submit to the most servile Offices of Life to support it And if the Captain knew how we  had deceiv'd him and would offer to marry me to attone for his Fault I could not consent for I loath the very Thoughts of him Well then  Susan  said I when we have overcome all Difficulties and worn off the Remembrance of our Sufferings I will settle a Competency for Life that shall put thee above all Fear of Want Madam reply'd  Susan  that's all I shall desire and then I'll go to some Corner of the World live retir'd and repent of all my past Crimes and Follies I told her she needed not do that she might notwithstanding what was past live with me No Madam that can never be return'd  Susan  for you must of necessity to clear your own Reputation divulge the Secret and then with what Confidence shall I be able to look upon any one I told her it would be esteem'd as an Action wholly virtuous without one Spot or Blemish All I was capable of saying could not alter her Resolution but she persisted in retiring from the World and living recluse and I desisted from speaking any more upon the Subject  It had been much happier for us both if we had never enter'd upon the Argument for we had not remain'd silent a Moment before the Captain enter'd with a Light in his Hand and the utmost Fury in his Countenance Thou Devil said he to  Susan  and hast thou betray'd me Wretch after what I have done for thee but I shall study some way to have ample Vengeance on thee And for you Madam I shall give you still the same Terms and Time I first propos'd but that past expect not the least Hope for I will enjoy you tho' the Moment after Death should seize me When he had done speaking he went out But it was a considerable time ere we came out of our Surprize  We were convinc'd that he had listen'd and overheard all our Discourse though we spoke but softly and we fear'd to utter our Thoughts to one another as imagining he would overhear us still But  Susan  at last broke out in these Words Good Heav'n I hope the Punishments I am bound to suffer will atone for all my Offences If it will make my Peace with Thee I'll undergo all the Torments in the World in that blest Hope I had not Words to comfort her for the thoughts of my own Condition ty'd up my Tongue but the Pain of Thinking nothing could exceed I pray'd to God to bring me out of this Misfortune or give me Force of Reason to suffer with Patience a Dissolution from this World When  Susan  heard me she told me she could see no Path to lead us thro' this Labyrinth of Misfortunes but through the Gate of Death and added she since we must die once the sooner we leave this troublesome World the sooner we shall find Rest  Death still bore to me a frosty Sound however I soon resolv'd upon't but the manner of it was what most confounded me At last we both thought of Drowning and had resolv'd whenever the Captain came to accomplish his wicked Intent to throw our selves out of the Cabin Window Will you so said the Captain who had overheard us again for Grief had taken all Caution from us but I'll soon prevent that He immediately took Hammer and Nails and nail'd the Shutters so close that it was not in our weak Strength to undo them After he was gone we spent the Night in Prayer and just before the Morning dawn'd we understood by the rocking of the Ship the Noise of the Sailors and the Loudness of the Wind that we were in a prodigious Storm This gave  us Hopes that the Ship would be cast away and that God had heard our Prayers and would not let us lay violent Hands upon our selves Nay deceiving Hope was ready to enter our Thoughts that we might be cast away upon some Shore and receive Assistance when we least expected it The Storm lasted the whole Day and part of the next Night but as it sensibly abated so our Fears increas'd The Captain gave us another Visit Well said he Madam I hope you have had sufficient time to consider of my Proposals and I am now come for my final Answer Said I Heav'n has given you an Answer by raising the Storm and if you have the least Notion of a Divinity you'll find 'twas his Voice that spok to you in that Tempest to desist from such a base Attempt Nay Madam if you imagine you can preach me from my Design preach on a God's Name Wretch that thou art said I how canst thou mention that sacred Name and yet have such Thoughts as He abhors I fancy Madam return'd the Brute your Ladyship feels the Influence of the Moon and for fear I should catch the Infection I'll leave you for a while but with a Word by the by If you don't consent the next time I come by Hell since you will not let me mention Heaven I'll not only ravish you but every Sailor in the Ship shall do so too if they think fit and I believe they are sharp enough sett to fall too upon worse Food than I shall set before them  He said a great many more gross things that would only become his Mouth to utter And to convince you Madam that I will do what I say said he I shall begin with Mrs  Susan  Come Mistress said he to her now I have had the first Cut of you I'll let my Sailors go to  Dinner With this he forc'd us both on the Quarter Deck and call'd all the Seamen about him Here my Lads said he I have but two dainty Bits and I'll give you one among you that you mayn't think I am over greedy The Sailors star'd upon one another and did not well know what he meant till he told them in Terms plain enough with Promises of Reward to him that would prove the greatest Rogue  Susan  fell upon her Knees and intreated them not to take Pattern from their barbarous Captain but to pity a poor unfortunate Woman reduc'd to the fatal Necessity of living no longer Some of the Sailors made Sport with her Misery while others began to pity her One blunt Fellow cry'd Damn it I love a Woman well enough but don't care to have her forc'd upon me It's like eating against one's Stomach Beside said another I suppose there's some Reason of the Captain's Liberality or he would not part with her I observ'd one of them that stood at some Distance taking Notice of what was done without seeming pleas'd I thought I knew his Face too and he appear'd above a common Sailor by his Looks and Cleanliness I had not till now appear'd publickly I was determin'd to speak to him and to crave his Assistance Assoon as he saw me he seem'd amaz'd and cry'd Bless me Madam how came you here I told him I was betray'd by the Captain I was inform'd said he that he had two Ladies Passengers for  Zant  but I little thought you were one of them for I was not on Board till an Hour after you arriv'd I begg'd he would take me under his Protection which he swore with a great Oath he would or the Captain should cut his Throat Madam added he I am Mate of this Vessel put in by your  honourable Father and had been Captain if it had not been for the Tricks of that Rascal pointing to the Captain  The Sailors were so divided between themselves that they had not proceeded to any Violence with  Susan  and she remain'd leaning upon the Side of the Ship all drown'd in Tears The Captain had all this time been laughing at the Disputes of the Sailors but perceiving the Mate in Conference with me came up to him and with a faucy Tone ask'd him what Business he had with me I have no other Business answer'd the Mate but to protect her from your ill Usage You impertinent Coxcomb cry'd the Captain I'll teach you to intermeddle with my Affairs and upon saying this he lifted up his Hand and struck him But the Mate soon return'd his Blow with Interest and knock'd him down upon the Deck The Sailors came and parted 'em but the Captain swore that Blow should cost him his Life He upon the Instant ran into the Cabin for some Instrument to dispatch him as was suppos'd but the Mate follow'd him close and knowing his violent Temper barr'd the Door of the Cabin so that the Captain remain'd a Prisoner  The Mate took from his own Cabin which was near the Captain's a Cutlass and put himself against the Door and swore he would be the Death of him that first attempted to release him and bad none of them offer to stir till they had heard what he had to say  The Sailors had cast off all Thoughts from  Susan  to hear what the Mate could say who declar'd who I was and by what Means I was betray'd on Board When the Sailors found I was their Mistress and Owner of the Ship they soon began to repent of what they were  going about and declar'd they would serve me with their Lives When I found I had gain'd most of 'em on my Side I told 'em my Story at length only concealing  Susan  's Affair with the Captain and they seem'd all prodigiously amaz'd and stood gaping upon me like so many Statues  The Captain in the Cabin was all this time swearing cursing and making a Noise at his Restraint I told the Mate if he thought fit we would release him Yes Madam if you please said he out of the Great Cabin but we must confine him somewhere else well knowing his turbulent Spirit would never be easy I told him I would be guided by him and if he pleased to accept of the Command of the Vessel if it was in my Power to give it him it was at his Service He return'd me a great many Thanks and told me he would be very faithful in his Commission We releas'd the Captain out of the Cabin but as soon as he came upon the Deck he was seiz'd with a great deal of Difficulty Iron'd and confin'd to another Cabin He rag'd like a Madman at this Treatment but all to no Purpose I told him he should want nothing but his Liberty neither would I prosecute him as his Crimes deserv'd when we arriv'd in  England  I desir'd the Mate to make for  Bristol  with all the Expedition imaginable with a Promise that I would recompense every common Sailor with double the Wages they expected for their Voyage They all huzza'd at the News and one and all promis'd to serve me with their Lives The Mate told me the Wind was against us in our Course but that he would ply it to Windward as they call it in Expectation of its Changing I ask'd him whereabouts we were  and he told me very near the Streights of  Gibraltar  and should have been at  Zant  by that time but that they were hindred by contrary Winds and drove back by the late Storm I told him how the Captain had deceiv'd me in telling me we were not six Days from the  English  Coast  Susan  's Joy cannot be express'd at our happy Deliverance and you may he assur'd I was as well pleas'd as she was though it did not appear outwardly so much Besides I considered the Mutabilty of the things of this World and we were soon taught by Experience the Uncertainty of humane Affairs for before the Evening we were chac'd by a Rover who soon came up with us and took us after an obstinate Resistance tho' we did not lose one Man but the barbarous Captain who was kill'd in the Place of his Confinement without being in the Action  The Captain of the Rover was the same we have now made our Escape from He never would tell me what became of  Susan  and the Crew Madam said  Mustapha  I can inform you They and all the Crew were ransom'd for a thousand Pound and their Ship given them again They did their Endeavour to ransom you but to no Purpose for they could never learn what was become of you  Mrs  Villars  thus ended her Relation only added that the Captain fell desperately in Love with her and would never hear of her Ransom tho' he treated her with Decency allowing her every thing but Liberty with the conveniency of a Study of Books which the Captain had procur'd by his Piracy and ever left in her Closet her Jewels and other things of Value that he had taken out of the Ship  WHEN Mrs  Villars  had finish'd her Story I return'd her Thanks for the Trouble I had given her Sir return'd she Thanks will not recompense me for the Pains I have taken I shall demand the same Satisfaction from you I told her I should readily obey her Commands but I begg'd leave to give her the Relation in  French  that our  Italian  might partake for I design with your leave to insist of the same from him Sir reply'd the Lady I would have related my unhappy Story in that Language if you had given me the least Hint But however I'll go once more over again if you please in  French  at least the chief Circumstances that we may more ingage the Person to declare how he has shar'd the same Fate with us I begg'd she wou'd give me leave to take that Trouble if it were only to let her see I had imprinted in my Memory what concern'd her so strongly that I could repeat every Circumstance She gave me leave to proceed on which I told her Story over again in  French  to the  Italian  When I had finish'd she gave me Thanks for the Pains I had taken Tho' I had not been so long in the Relation yet I made up the Time in descanting upon her Danger and hard Fate That a Lady of her Birth Beauty and Estate should be so far forsaken by Fortune as to be reduc'd to wretched Slavery  I then began my own Story from my Birth to our present State Tho' in what related to my Passion for the Lady I did not directly explain yet I gave her Hints enough to understand she was the Idol of my Soul and tho' Love like Hope does oft deceive us I thought my obscure Declaration did not displease her  We then desir'd the  Italian  to proceed in his Relation He sighing told us he was too much oblig'd to me to refuse me any thing tho' it would call to his Remembrance Transactions that would bring Tears into his Eyes After some Pause he began to this Effect  THE STORY OF THE  ITALIAN  SLAVE  _I Was born at the City of  Rome  renown'd for its Grandeur and Antiquity and I may say without boasting of a noble Family but had the Misfortune to come last into the World and the youngest of five Sons and two Daughters My Father had a plentiful Fortune but before his Death he had much weaken'd it in giving Dowries to my two Sisters who were both marry'd far above their Fortunes tho' not equal to their Birth But Riches now ballance every Thing and weigh down Birth and humble Virtue and he that has most Gold is the greatest Man  We lost our Mother in our early Days and my Father follow'd before I was ten Years old having settled all his Estate on his eldest Son to keep up the Grandeur of the Name and left three Brothers of us to depend on him  My Father in his Lifetime gave us an Education suitable to our Birth and Family and my Brother to give him his Due compleated us Two of my Brothers he procur'd Posts in the Army for who both lost their Lives in one glorious Campaign The other dyed young  It was imagin'd by every body that had the Privilege to think for me that their Deaths would be of no small Advantage to me and it had for some Years the Appearance of it My Brother had attain'd to his thirtieth Year without once ever thinking of Marriage But an advantageous Match being propos'd it was thought convenient for him to pursue it The Lady that was design'd for him he had never seen but he was inform'd she was young rich and beautiful He was brought to the Sight of her and fell violently in Love with her at the first Visit and his Passion encreas'd every Moment The Day was fixt for their Nuptials by the Father of the Lady which was to be the  Easter  following I had attain'd to my eighteenth Year and no Provision made for me and it was thought that this Match would not bring me the least Advantage  One Day my Brother told me he had procur'd me the Post of Captain of the Pope's Guards and tho' it was far beneath my Birth yet I was pleas'd with it that I might have the Means to subsist without being subject to the Caprice of Fortune and the Dependance of a Brother of an uncertain Temper My Brother having some urgent Affairs that call'd him  hastily out of Town he gave me a Letter to deliver to his Mistress which was to excuse his sudden Departure  Assoon as he was gone I went to execute his Commission and being known to be the Brother of the intended Husband had the Liberty of presenting the Letter to the Lady's own Hands But what Misfortunes did that Interview cost me I no sooner saw her but I lost my Heart and the Regard I ow'd my Brother was of no Force against her Charms I observ'd she perus'd the Letter with Indifferency which did not displease me Yet I so far overcame my growing Passion as to add something to the Excuse my Brother had wrote I observ'd in our Conversation that the propos'd Alliance was not very pleasing to her and she at last frankly told me Duty more than Inclination would make her comply with it I told her were my Brother's Condition mine and I had been acquainted with her Sentiments I should not have the Fortitude to support my ill Fortune yet should have so much Regard to her whatever were my Troubles not to be oblig'd to Duty but Inclination  She told me with a rising Blush those Espousals never prosper'd where the Hand could not bestow the Heart I agreed with her Sentiments but added I fear'd her Heart was already given where she could not bestow her Hand  Sir said she I have ever been a Friend to Plaindealing and Truth appears so amiable to me that I neither will nor can deny it to you O happy Man cry'd I whoe'er thou art Fortune has shed her happiest Influence on thee and it is not in her Power to make thee miserable when blest with so much consenting Beauty  Sir return'd the Lady the Person you esteem so happy is ignorant of my Inclinations for him and Fear will make me conceal the Secret And the chief Reason why I disclose it to you is that you would inform your Brother for added she with Tears if I am forc'd to wed him I shall be for ever miserable Her Grief touch'd me to the Heart and she observ'd the Sorrow in my Face I perceive said she the Love you bear your Brother affects your Breast Madam said I since you have made me this frank Declaration I also will be free and utter all my Heart The Grief you see rising in my Face is owing to the Torments of my Soul The very Moment I beheld your Charms Love shot me with his sharpest pointed Dart and all the Hope I have is cold Despair She observ'd my Declaration with a great deal of Satisfaction and remain'd silent some time viewing me stedfastly Upon which I cast my Eyes upon the Ground Sir said she with an unconfirm'd Voice I hope you are sincere in what you say for the Supposition of it will draw another Secret from me which is this The Reason why I cannot love your Brother is that I have long since given my Heart toyou The first time I saw your Face it left its peaceful mansion of Repose and fled for Shelter to a Stranger's Breast The Joy I felt at this free Declaration so transported me that I knew not whether I dreamt or no but being convinc'd of the Reality I threw my self at her Feet and uttered all my Tongue could express slowing from a sincere Heart She told me she had resolv'd on Death before she would consent to wed my Brother And inform'd me also that her Passion had been increasing upwards of two Years The first time she saw me was taking my leave of my Brothers when  they were going to that Campaign from which they never return'd In short we were as much in Love as ever any two were  We agreed to meet the next Day at the same Place where I had the Liberty of coming as her BrotherinLaw that was to be  I was Impatient for the next Day imagining Time to have no Wings But the happy Moment came at last We talk'd of nothing for several Hours but our mutual Love at last we fell on the ungrateful Subject of the approaching Nuptials and how we should prevent 'em I propos'd to her running away and tying our selves fast by the sacred Bond of Wedlock Though said she I will never be any one's but yours yet we must consider of Futurity I know your Fortune is but small and mine tho' a large one depends upon my Father I'll find some Means to defer the Marriage you may do your Endeavour to disswade your Brother for I fancy Fortune more than Beauty has gain'd his Heart I assur'd her to the contrary and that he was very much in Love with her We both wish'd it had been otherways but resolv'd to love on We parted tho' we had not resolv'd on any thing and appointed to meet the next Day in a private Corner of the Town at an Acquaintance of mine that I could confide in tho' I would not trust him with the Secret well knowing a Matter of Importance inslaves the Person that discloses it I told him I had an Intrigue with a Person of Quality that I must be obliged to carry on at his House which he consented to very willingly We met according to our Appointment but an Hour before the time prefixt not willing one should be before the other She came alone too for she would not trust any of her Servants We  met there every Day and one time above the rest Love being pregnant in both our Eyes I took the happy Opportunity and was bless'd in the Possession of all I wish'd on Earth But Enjoyment was so far from palling my Desires that it rather encreas'd 'em We liv'd in all the Delight of Love for a Month but then came the Bitter to all our Sweets My Brother arriv'd and the fatal Day appointed for the Marriage aproach'd We had given our selves up so intirely to Love that we did not think of what was to come or if the intruding Thought did creep in we would immediately lull it to Rest like a froward Child  When we parted it was with such a Regret and Sorrow that foreboded our ill Fortune The Father of my Mistress had order'd every thing for the Nuptial Solemnity with the greatest Magnificence but two Days before it was to be solemniz'd it was reported all over  Rome  that  Don Antonio Grimaldi  's only Daughter who was my Mistress was taken dangerously ill I was not displeas'd at the Rumour as guessing her Design My Brother was never from her and I was pretty well assur'd the Sight of him gave her a great deal of Pain One Day finding my Brother very melancholy I ask'd him if it was the Indisposition of  Grimaldi  's Daughter that occasion'd the Gloom I observed in his Countenance He reply'd she was the Cause of what he felt He farther added that he thought her Sickness counterfeit only to avoid him and that he had many Reasons to believe she had given her Heart to another I us'd many Arguments with him to leave her and that she was not worth his farther Thought But he assur'd me it was not in his Power to hate her I began to reflect with Reason on the Conduct  of my Love and found I had involv'd my self in a very dangerous and troublesome Affair But notwithstanding all my Reasonings I found my self more and more in Love and Absence which cures a light Passion added Strength to mine for I had not seen her in fifteen Days I was resolved at last to visit her and took the Opportunity when my Brother was with the  Pope  in his Closet I found it no Difficulty to gain Admittance knowing who I was But notwithstanding all my Endeavours could not get an Opportunity of speaking to her there being a great many Visitants I took an Occasion of feeling her Pulse and we had the Happiness of moulding our Hands for a Moment I durst not stay long for fear my Brother should come while I was there and yet I had resolv'd to inform him of my Visit which I did the first time of our Meeting but added that it was Curiosity and to oblige him that I gave my self that Trouble He thank'd me and ask'd me what I thought of her Indisposition I told him I could not answer for the State of her Heart but I was assur'd that her Body was in a violent Fever This I said a little to undeceive him for since he could not be persuaded to abandon her I thought it would be more to our Advantage to make him believe it was a real Indisposition He went to make her a Visit that Evening and at his Return told me I had given him true Information for the Physicians had order'd her to be let Blood and that she was in a dangerous Fever and her Father design'd to send her into the Country the next Day I was mightily pleas'd that he was deceiv'd as well as the Father and I did not doubt but she had persuaded the Physicians to favour the Deceit  Accordingly the next Day she was convey'd in a Litter to a Country House of her Father's two Leagues from  Rome  upon the River  Tyber  I flatter'd my self that her being in the Country would give me a fairer Opportunity of conversing with her But though I try'd all the Methods imaginable I could not find the least Glimpse of Hope in above six Weeks time I was perfectly like a mad Creature and all my Friends particularly my Brother took Notice of my Uneasiness But I kept the Cause of it intirely to my self  Any one that's a Judge of Love and has ever been in my Circumstances may guess at what I felt All I cou'd learn of my Mistress was that she continu'd very ill My Mind was tortur'd with a thousand Imaginations Sometimes I thought her false and that it was her own Desire which kept me from seeing her at other times I fancy'd she was really indispos'd  A Month more slip'd away and I was as unlikely to see her then as at first One Morning my Brother came into my Chamber before I was drest He seem'd overcomplaisant to me and express'd a Concern for the Alteration of my Temper I fancy said he Brother that Love has forc'd himself into your Breast and that the Object of your Passion has no Regard to the Torments you endure I excus'd my self to him that Love had no concern in my Humour but rather an inward Indisposition of Body He said many kind things upon that Occasion promis'd to assist me all he could and left me  Assoon as he was gone I dress'd my self and got on Horseback in order once more to try my Fortune and I had taken a Resolution to see my Mistress whatever Hazard I should run  When I came upon the skirt of a Wood within half a League of the Place where I was going I was surrounded by a dozen Men on Horseback who notwithstanding the Resistance I made got me down bound me and carry'd me into the Wood I imagin'd 'em to be Thieves by their Proceeding but they never once attempted to take any thing from me which alter'd my Opinion and I began to think they had a Design upon my Life  The State and Uncertainty of my Love made Death look like a Friend  They kept me in the Wood till the Dusk of the Evening then clapt me into a Litter and travell'd hard all Night The next Morning I was put into a Boat and hurry'd on board a Vessel that lay a League off at Sea Assoon as they had receiv'd me they weighted and set Sail and the Person that seem'd to have Command in the Boat prov'd to be the Captain of the Vessel  They carry'd me bound into his Cabin When we were alone he gave me a Paper which I soon knew to be my Brother's Handwriting and in it an open Letter whose Hand I could not tell by the Direction Upon this the  Italian  took 'em both out of his Bosom See said he the fatal Scroll which has robb'd me of all Joy in this Life and which I have kept during my Captivity  The first Letter he read was to this Effect  I  Will not call thee by the Name of Brother That thou hast basely forfeited But know the Hand of Heav'n hangs over thee to punish thy unfaithful dealing with one who thinks it the greatest Curse on Earth that our Parents should be the same The enclos'd Letter came into my Hands by the Honesty  of her that was commission'd to bring it to thee who abhorring thy guilty Commerce with her ungrateful Mistress has discover'd thy Scene of Villany Know after thou hast read this prepare to suffer for thy Ingratitude An Hour's Space is the Length of thy Life and I think Death too small a Revenge for the Wrongs thou hast committed against  Hernando Alvares  The other was as follows  To  Antonio Alvares  LIFE of my Life I have resolv'd to hazard every thing to let you know the State of my Body and Mind Though Body Life and Heart are entirely thine yet I fear Death will rob thee of 'em My counterfeit Illness that Day you saw me without having the Happiness of speaking to each other brought a real Distemper upon me and my Fever took away my Understanding I hope I have not in my Ravings declar'd the Secret of my Soul The Sight of your Brother retards my Health and the Hopes I have of my Recovery is once more to see thee thou Darling of my Heart I have prevail'd upon one of my Women with Presents and Promises whom I hope is honest to deliver this to thee Our private Meetings I fear will prove fatal to me for I find our Commerce if I survive will make me a Mother but for fear it may touch me more in what thou art to suffer if known to be the Father Death shall release thee from that Danger  Upon the reading of these two Letters different Passions swell'd in my Soul My Heart was torn with Agonies for her I lov'd and my Breast was fir'd with Revenge against my unnatural Brother For as he had shook off all Brotherly  Love I thought it was but Justice I should do so too  I sat a considerable time in the utmost Agony not for fear of Death for I must confess I had not the least Thought about it The Captain of the Vessel seeing me in that Condition spoke to me after this manner Sir tho' I am well paid by your Brother to end your Life yet I have so much Compassion for your Sufferings knowing your Crime to be only Love to mitigate your Sentence I'll put you into a Boat with two Men to conduct you and every thing that shall be necessary Upon this Condition that you will give me your Word and Honour not to appear at  Rome  in forty Days  I thank'd him for his Kindness gave him my Word and told him it was not in fear of Death but only to disappoint my barbarous Brother Immediately a Boat was hoisted out and every thing that was needful for a Month's Voyage My two Men were paid for the Voyage beforehand and we left the Ship I I order'd 'em to steer for  Leghorn  because there I could be furnish'd with every thing that I wanted from my Sister who had resided there two Years with her Husband a Nobleman of  Florence  But the Wind not proving favourable we were drove out of our intended Course and had it not been for a  French  Vessel bound for  Malta  who took us up we had certainly perish'd And happy for me had it been my Fate to have had a Wave for my Windingsheet for two Days after we were received on Board a Corsair of  Barbary  met with us and took us all Prisoners  I made no extraordinary Appearance being I was always disguis'd when I went to the House where my Mistress lay indispos'd  Hamet  the Name of our  Irish  Renagado valu'd my Ransom but at two hundred Pounds I wrote to both my Sisters several times and laid before 'em my unhappy Condition but never could hear from 'em So that I either fear'd my Letters had miscarry'd or they were willing to forget an unhappy Wretch like my Self Tho' to say Truth I never receiv'd any hard Usage from  Hamet  therefore if the Divine Being will favour us in our Escape I'll faithfully send him my Ransom  WHEN he had ended his Story we condol'd with one another for our Misfortues had a Resemblance By this time the Day began to dawn and  Mustapha  told us we should reach  Magazan  before Night We were all mightily overjoy'd because we expected to be a Day longer in our Voyage I begg'd the Favour of Mrs  Villars  to let me cleanse her Face from the Ombre which she consented to I was fill'd with Contemplation of her Beauty but was rous'd from those pleasing Thoughts by the Appearance of several lowring Clouds that seem'd to threaten us with a Hurrican frequent in those Parts and tho' they seldom last long yet they might prove dangerous to our small Vessel  Mustapha  advis'd to make to Shore but I could by no Persuasion agree to that but ordered him to hold on his Course for  Magazan  But the Tempest rose so suddenly and so violent that we were oblig'd to leave our selves to the Mercy of the Waves and we did not know which way we drove for the dark Clouds had almost form'd another Night  Our Boat was a new stout Boat and bore the Weather very well but it frighten'd Mrs  Villars  very much and I had no other Regard but for her The Tempest continu'd for near half  the Day and when it grew Calm and clear'd up we were not in Sight of Land By good Fortune I had provided a Compass and I order'd  Mustapha  to steer due South the same Course we kept before the Storm began which was before the Wind But tho' we had sail'd several Hours South we could not discover any Land  Mustapha  advis'd us to put to Windward back for he did not douht but we had overshot  Magazan  in the Storm  We were preparing to tack about when we discover'd a Sail within half a League of us for it was hazy Weather notwithstanding the Storm was over or we should have perceiv'd her time enough to have avoided her We kept upon a Wind and it freshning upon us our Sail split and we found it was impossible to avoid the Ship who gain'd upon us every Moment We thought it our wisest Course to lye by and wait for her Now all the Hope we had was that the Vessel would prove a Ship of  Europe  I desir'd Mrs  Villars  to conceal her Sex and begg'd the Favour of the  Italian  and  Mustapha  to keep the Secret The Ship was near us and to our surprizing Joy hoisted  French  Colours We immediately put on Board because they lay by on purpose  We were soon inform'd Monsieur  Pidau de St Olon  was on Board the Ambassador from the King of  France  to the Emperor of  Morocco  to treat of Peace between the two Crowns I immediately begg'd to be brought to the Ambassador's Presence who receiv'd us very kindly I told him all our Stories but conceal'd that of Mrs  Villars  for fear of any Accident He us'd us very civilly and promis'd us his Protection He said his Affair would not detain him long and he would be sure to gain safe Conduct for us into our own Country  I return'd him Thanks for his generous Proffer and begg'd he would command my Life to see how readily I would obey him He told me since I was willing to oblige him he would soon put it in my Power to serve him  I have said he lost three of my Retinue in the Voyage two by Sickness and one drown'd by Accident You'll just make up that Number and you need not take any Care for Habits I will provide for you The fourth Person in your Company I believe you'll be satisfy'd should be taken Care of on Board our Ship for his Landing on the  African  Coast may prove prejudicial to your Affairs I was mightily pleas'd with his Proposals and communicated it to Mrs  Villars  and our  Italian  Gentleman Mrs  Villars  told me she was intirely under my Conduct and the  Italian  thought he should have a better Opportunity of getting into his own Country from  Mequinez  than  France  I would not suffer Monsieur  St Olon  to cloath us as he propos'd for I had procur'd of the  Jew  four rich Suits of  European  Cloaths for a Trifle which I design'd for Mrs  Villars  and my self for we intended she should put off her  Moorish  Dress the first Opportunity  The Ambassador provided a Cabin for Mrs  Villars  and me and he seem'd mightily taken with her Youth and Beauty as a Boy and he would often say Nature had mistaken her designing her for the fairest of the softest Sex These Encomiums made me very uneasy fearing he should find out the Truth But I understood afterwards he had not the least Mistrust  He treated us very splendidly at Supper considering we were at Sea When the Ambassador went to Rest Mrs  Villars  and I retir'd to the Cabin allotted us What a sensible Pleasure did I  feel to have the Happiness of her Company alone without the Fears and Terrors of offending any one She perceiv'd a Satisfaction in my Countenance that spoke the Joy of my Heart and by her Discourse that ensu'd she was in some Fear lest a guilty Thought had work'd that Change  Mr  Boyle  said she I hope you know what Regard to pay my Sex and do not wrong the good Opinion I have conceiv'd of you I own the greatest Obligation to you and I am not displeas'd I am in your Power while you use that Power with Moderation I had hardly the Patience to hear her out Madam return'd I be assur'd your own Soul shall not be more pure than my Thoughts But yet I will take the Freedom to declare no Person in the World has that Command over me as you have I must own you have it in your Power to punish me by slighting a Heart full of the most tender Regard for you and all I ask is only leave to hope if I am deny'd that the utmost of my Resentments to you shall only be in hating Life which will be a Burden not able for me long to bear It would be base in me return'd Mrs  Villars  to give Tormens where I am oblig'd I think to disguise our Thoughts is an Art better lost than learnt And to deal frankly with you I cannot find in my Heart any Aversion for you which is a Declaration if you knew my Temper ought to satisfie you I said all the tender things I was capable of in return for this great Blessing and our Conversation lasted several Hours I told her at last I was well assur'd she wanted Rest and whatever Pleasure I took in her Company I would deprive my self of it and leave her to her Repose  She seem'd very much concern'd that I was oblig'd to leave her alone well knowing I  should not get the Convenience of a Place to rest my self  I told her there was not any Fatigue I would not undergo for her with Pleasure I left her and Night soon slipt away in pleasing Imaginations I was surpriz'd to see her who was ever in my Thoughts come out of the Cabin dress'd Madam said I to her I hope you have had nothing to disturb your Sleep She obligingly answer'd me Nothing but the Thoughts of your waking and therefore she desir'd I would go and repose my self in the Cabin and I think said she 'tis my Duty to watch now I excus'd my self and told her it was but for one Night more for in all Probability we should land the next Day and provide our selves with better Accommodation  We went into the Cabin together and our Conversation chiefly center'd on Love She told me at last she would leave her Acknowledgments to me till she was more at Liberty and in her own Country for fear I should imagine the Need she had of my Service should make her declare her self in my Favour When I found so fair a Beginning I was resolv'd to push my Fortune till with many Intreaties Vows and Oaths of my Fidelity she own'd to me she had a tender Regard for me when she saw me first for she was convinc'd of my Love at our first Conversation not continu'd she that I had any Understanding in the Art of Love but I knew the Hazard you had put your self in to serve me could have no other Motive but that Passion and the more I thought of it the more I found my Heart inclining to believe you  Those Persons that have felt the soft Passion may make a Judgment of the Transports I was in at this Declaration I kiss'd her Hand a thousand  times and press'd it to my Heart She begg'd me to curb my Transport for fear of being overheard or observed for continu'd she you may remember in my Relation of my Misfortunes how near we were suffering by such an Oversight This kind Caution bridled my Tongue but could not command my Eyes they spoke the Language of my Soul  Our silent Conversation was disturb'd by the Joy of the Sailors in discovering Land and we thought it prudent to wait on the Ambassador and congratulate him upon it He receiv'd us very kindly and told us he was pleas'd upon our Accounts that we might recover on Shore the Fatigue of the Sea and our Captivity The Captain told us we should come to an Anchor before Dinner in the Port of  Mammora  I was mightily surpriz'd to find we were got to the South of  Sallee  and found that the Tempest had drove us back beyond  Sallee  several Leagues This we still esteem'd a greater Happiness and if  Mustapha  had not been guided by me we had miss'd the good Fortune of meeting with the  French  Vessel and of course made the Port of  Sallee  whether we would or no Upon this Thought I began to imagine that  Mustapha  as understanding the Mathematicks knew where we were and consequently had design'd to betray us I communicated my Thoughts to Monsieur St  Olon  and he came into my Sentiments He immediately call'd the Captain of the Ship and order'd  Mustapha  to be strictly guarded in his Absence and if any  Moors  came on Board to prevent his seeing of them but desir'd that he might want nothing but his Liberty When we came to an Anchor the Captain was sent on Shore to acquaint the  Moors  with the Arrival of an Ambassador from  France  and presently  the Fort saluted him with one and twenty Guns which was return'd from the Ship Gun for Gun The Governour of  Mammora  in an Hour's time came on Board attended who saluted our Ambassador and begg'd he would have Patience to stay in the Ship till he had acquainted the Emperor his Master with his Arrival The Ambassador invited him to an Entertainment and tho' I observ'd he refus'd Wine yet he and his Retinue swallow'd the Punch so fast that their Heads prov'd as light as their Heels When they went on Shore again the Cannon of the Ship gave 'em a Salvo which was return'd by the Fort assoon as ever they were landed The next Day an Order came from the Emperor that we should immediately repair to  Mequinez  the Place where the Emperor resided  The next Day the Ambassador set forward with his whole Retinue among which were Mrs  Villars  the  Italian  and my self drest richly after the  European  Fashion We were provided with  Dromedaries  to carry us all but the Ambassador who was presented with an  Arabian  Courser Within a Mile or two of  Mequinez  we perceiv'd the King at the Head of his Army in a great Plain At first I thought it a Mark of Respect to the Ambassador of  France  but found it was purely Accident for our Guide led us out of the Way to avoid 'em  When we arriv'd at  Mequinez  we were led to a House belonging to the  French  Consul or rather a House he had hir'd for that Occasion Before we were well enter'd the House a Guard of  Moors  was fixt upon us and strict Orders given not a Soul should stir out not even the Ambassador nor Consul I thought this an odd Proceeding and sometimes imagin'd it was upon  our Account as Fear is an expeditious Painter But my Timerity vanish'd when Monsieur St  Olon  inform'd me it was the  Moorish  Custom not to let a Foreign Ambassador give or receive Visits till after his first Audience  Mrs  Villars  and I had one Apartment alotted us with but one Bed in it after the  Moorish  Manner She told me she could not bear the Thoughts of my watching every Night and begg'd I would go to Rest with the  Italian  but we found he was provided of a Companion one of the Retinue and there was no help for it I always retir'd when my Mistress undress'd herself and gave her time to go into Bed I then with a Quilt laid my self down on the Floor but was far from taking any Repose The Thoughts of the Woman I lov'd being so near me naked in Bed kindled such a Desire in my Breast and the Pain I took to smother it perfectly burnt me up I would have my Readers excuse me if they are disoblig'd at any Part of my Story because I am only relating Matters of Fact  The next Day when I rose from my boarded Bed I retir'd to give the Loadstone of my Desires time to dress her self When I enter'd the Room again she observ'd my Countenance very attentively and told me she was griev'd to find in my Features something that spoke a disorder'd Body which I am sure said she is for want of Rest But added she I beg it as a Favour you will immediately undress your self and go into Bed and try to repose your self and I'll make your Excuse to the Ambassador I refus'd it a great while but in short she forc'd me to comply with her Commands I went to Bed but new Thoughts again attack'd me and drove Sleep away Mrs  Villars  had retir'd and staid about an Hour When she came in again she stole softly for fear of disturbing me My Mind was so violently agitated that I really began to be out of Order and feaverish which she observ'd and came to the Bedside and with a tender Inquietude ask'd me how I did I took hold of her Hand press'd it to my Lips and thank'd her for her kind Care of me Alas she cry'd you are very much indispos'd and I am the Cause of it Upon this the Tears ran down her Cheeks like Morning Dew on Roses Her Tenderness gave me all the Joy imaginable and as she lean'd her Head over me weeping I press'd her soft Lips close to mine which plung'd my Soul in Ecstasies of Joy She blush'd at my Freedom yet still begg'd I would try to sleep I told her it was impossible while she was there upon this she was going to retire in haste but I caught her by the soft Hand and told her if she went out it would be a greater Impossibility for me to rest She conjur'd me by that Love I profess'd if it was not a Falshood to declare to her the Torments of my Mind She insisted so much upon't that I told her the Secret of my Heart She fell upon her Knees and begg'd I would not mention it any more for she own'd her self so much oblig'd to me there was not any thing in her Power she could refuse me but that I begg'd her Pardon and had resolv'd to suffer Death sooner than to have disclos'd my Malady but I would be ever silent upon that Theme till she commanded me to speak My dear  Boyle  said she I am not asham'd to call you so stay till we arrive in  England  and I here vow to make you mine whenever you shall command me Upon saying this she join'd her Lips to mine not  considering that in endeavouring to suppress my Flame she pour'd Oyl upon it and made it burn the fiercer I told her true Love was above nice Formality and that Marriages were made in Heaven Said she I hope they are but beg by both our Loves to drop this Theme I told her I would tho' Death should follow I remain'd silent for some time while Tears stopt her Speech We were interrupted by a Messenger from the Ambassador who came to invite us to Dinner for he always did us the Favour of dining at his Table I begg'd to be excus'd for I found my self a little indispos'd The Messenger had not been gone a Moment before the Ambassador came in to enquire after my Health and brought his Physician with him who feeling my Pulse told him I was in a Fever but Bleeding he did not doubt would give me Ease I told him I should be better in the Morning if not I would take his Advice The Ambassador would have Mr  Villars  as we had nam'd her to Dinner with him who had endeavour'd to compose her self while they had been in the Room As she was going from me she squeez'd my Hand and said Endeavour to compose your self to Rest and you'll soon be better  They retir'd and left me to my own Thoughts which were various and disjointed Mrs  Villars  did not stay long she came in softly as before expecting that I might have been asleep When she found I was in the same Disorder she burst into Tears and cry'd Will nothing satisfy you but my Undoing No Madam said I I will fight with my Desires and am resolv'd to conquer or die She staid with me till Supper and our whole Discourse was upon the Passion of Love When she came back from  Supper I had got up and had drest my self but the Combat in my Mind had really disorder'd my Body which she soon saw She begg'd I would go to Bed again and she would watch me I told her the World should not prevail upon me to break her Rest nor even she her self who was more to me than the World I had sat me down upon the Bed and Mrs  Villars  came and sat down by me We remain'd silent a considerable time at last she took my Hands in hers and press'd me by the Fingers  Mr  Boyle  said she I have overcome my self I cannot see you in this Torture of Body and Mind and not contribute to your Ease Here solemnly swear to be my Husband and do with me what you please I hope you are a Man of Honour and that's what I rely upon Nothing in this World could have transported me so much as those few Words did I fell upon my Knees kiss'd her Hands and did I know not what Madam said I you have made me the happiest Man the World contains and if I thought my Heart and Tongue did not agree in what I am going to say I would pull 'em both out this Moment When I had said this I fell on my Knees and made this short Vow  Thou God that know'st the Heart of Man I do beseech Thee punish me with Eternity of Torments if ever I prove false to this Darling of my Soul who before Thee I take as the greatest Blessing to be my lawful Wife And here I swear  said she kneeling  to take no other to my Bed and Heart and with this Kiss  said she  I seal the sacred Union  I told her nothing could be more binding and the Priest could but confirm what we had done already  Now the tender Moment was approaching to crown my Joys with all I wish'd on Earth  Kings on their Thrones to me seem'd poor and base and I'd not have chang'd to be the Monarch of the Universe I begg'd my dear Bride I might be her Bridemaid as well as Husband and that she would give me leave to undress her Said she My Love my Life my Husband I am to obey you in every thing that's in my Power and when I fail in my Obedience may I be miserable in the Loss of you I was too eager to say any thing in Return but I undress'd her put her to Bed and you may be sure I did not stay long behind The Veil of Night was drawn round us and I plung'd into a Sea of Pleasures too delicate for Words to express  The next Day the Ambassador saw Contentment in both our Faces and congratulated me for the Recovery of my Health Never was there so tender a Wife and the longer I had the Happiness of Enjoyment the more my Love was rais'd The next Day the Ambassador was to have his first Audience and we were all to be in Readiness by Seven in the Morning I got up early and dress'd my dear Wife in a new Suit of Clothes on purpose for this Occasion The Governour of  Alcassar Hamet addo Riffy  was to be our Master of the Ceremonies who attended us with several  Moors  of Quality and a Troop of the King's Blacks as Guards We set forward about eight aclock in this Order Twelve of the  Moor  Guards Several of the Nobility two by two The Ambassador with  Hamet addo Riffy  on his Right Hand preceded by two Trumpets and KettleDrums the Post of Honour is on the Left among  Moors  because you have the Command of their Sword Twentyfour Gentlemen of the Ambassador's Train  two by two Twelve  French  Slaves that carry'd the Presents Twelve more of the Guards And the Order was clos'd by a  Moorish  Mob that abus'd us with their Tongues all they could nay some of them attempted to throw Stones but were bastinado'd by the Guards We were all on Foot though the King's Palace was a Mile from the Place where we set out  I was mightily concern'd at the Fatigue my dear Wife underwent for it was violent hot tho' we had the best on't for going next the Ambassador who order'd we should do so we had some Shelter from the Umbrella that was carried over his Head  We enter'd the Palace through the Marble Gate so call'd from two Marble Pillars that adorn it and from thence immur'd with white Walls and black Guards on each Side we arriv'd at a stately Pavilion where a Halt was commanded 'till the King was acquainted with our Arrival We waited some Time but at last saw him coming mounted on a white Horse through one of the Avenues that led to the Pavilion His Guards who had lin'd that Passage on each Side bow'd down to the Ground as he pass'd along He made but a very indifferent Appearance Assoon as he came to the Portico he gave a Launce that he bore to one of his Guard got from his Horse and squatted down upon the Floor without any thing under him He had nothing in his Dress to be distinguish'd from the rest of his Subjects but was muffled up to the Eyes with a Chocolatecolour Handkerchief that did not seem over clean His Legs and Arms were bare As to his Age he seem'd to be about Fifty of a very tawny Complexion and very lean his Hair black inclining to grey of a middle Stature  with hollow Cheeks and Eyes black a small hook'd Nose and thick Lips Some of his Courtiers sat down on each Side of him barelegg'd and bareheaded and behind him stood a Black with a great Fan in his Hand not only to cool him but to keep off the Muskito's a small Fly very troublesome in most Parts of  Africa  Mahumet ben Addo Otar  his chief Minister and Favourite was the only Person that stood  Assoon as the Emperor had squatted down on the Floor he repeated these Words in  Arabic  three times  Tay buon  which is as much as to say  You are welcome  a common Expression when they are address'd to by a Foreigner Then our Ambassador made a long Speech in  French  prepar'd for that Purpose which was only a Panegyric upon both Kings fulsome enough but the  French  deal much in wordy Compliments The Interpreter when the Ambassador had done read the same in  Arabic  to the Emperor The Speech was very long in  French  and  Arabic  but the Emperor heard it out patiently which was reckon'd a good Omen he also excus'd himself that he did not admit him sooner to his Audience it being their  Ramadan  or  Easter  When the Compliments were over the Ambassador presented all his Retinue to the Emperor but I observ'd he took a particular Notice of my Wife and ey'd her several times which gave me a great deal of Uneasiness for it is as dangerous to be a handsome Man as a handsome Woman in  Morocco  if the Brute of an Emperor should have a Fancy for 'em  I long'd to have an end of our Audience  After we were presented the Ambassador order'd his Presents to be open'd and spread before  the Emperor which consisted of fine Arms made at  Paris  several  English  Watches and Cloth two  Persian  Carpets and two Pieces of Gold and Silver Brocade The Emperor in return gave the Ambassador four young Slaves three of 'em  French  tho' he took 'em all for the same Nation but the other was an  Englishman  and the same Person I mentioned in the Beginning of this Relation who went in the same Boat on Board of the  Success  I was very much confounded at seeing him well knowing he was on Board when I fell out of the Ship I long'd for an Opportunity to confer with him tho' I could not perceive by his Looks that he knew me but that might be from my Change of Habit and the Sun's tarnishing my Complexion  The Emperor rose when he had given the Slaves mounted and rode off and we went home in the same Order as we came there only the chief Minister  Mahumet ben Addo Otar  accompany'd the Ambassador as far as the Marble Gate I inform'd my dear Wife when we came to our Lodging the Anxiety I was in when the Emperor ey'd her She told me she had made the same Observation with much Uneasiness for said she I had not the Presence of Mind upon the Instant to imagine my self a Man However we both wish'd our selves on Board and the Embassy well over and then we might make ourselves merry with our Fears  The next Day our Fears were much encreas'd for hearing a Noise in the Street we went to look out to know the Reason and discover'd  Hamet  our  Irish  Renegado with several Prisoners manacled We soon retir'd again but learnt by other People that they were going to the Emperor that he might make his Choice The  Sight of him renew'd our Fears as I said and we resolv'd immediately to get Leave to go on Board for fear of some unlucky Turn of Fortune  I upon the Instant went to wait on the Ambassador and declar'd to him what I had seen begging Leave at the same time we might be suffer'd to go on Board He told me he would comply with my Request for Mr  Villars  and the  Italian  but begg'd it as a Favour that I would stay with him for he should have great need of my Assistance and if any thing should fall out he would engage for my Liberty Though the Request cut me to the Heart yet it was neither Prudence nor good Manners to refuse him I gave him my Promise to obey his Commands but begg'd he would not insist upon my going abroad but as seldom as possible I went to my Wife my Readers perhaps may smile at my calling her  Wife  but I will assure 'em we thought our selves as much marry'd as if the Parson had executed his holy Function nevertheless we did not intend to neglect that Ceremony the very first Opportunity and told her the Ambassador's Request and my Promise She agreed with me in the Reasonableness of it but yet could not forbear shedding Floods of Tears at our we hop'd short Separation The next Day was design'd for their Journey but the ensuing Night was spent with Sighs Tears and a Lowness of Spirit that look'd ominous Yet we parted and for several Hours I could not bring my Mind to any peaceable Form to wait on the Ambassador But he sent for me at last and told me the Reason of his desiring me to continue with him was this  The King his Master had commanded him to make some Observation of the Customs and  Manners of this Part of  Africa  and added he I have observed in you a Capacity fit to assist me in the Design I told him he might command me in any thing that lay in my Power and that I took it for an Honour he would think me worth his Employment  We had Notice the next Day from the Person that attended my Wife with the Camels that he saw them safe on board which gave me some Comfort I begg'd the Ambassador to give me Leave to speak a Word or two with one of the Slaves that the Emperor gave him He order'd him to come before him where I desir'd he would tell me how he came into the Hands of the  Moors  He was prodigiously surpriz'd to see me there and could hardly believe his Eyes for it was thought by every Body that I had either been kill'd or drown'd as indeed it was very improbable to think otherwise He inform'd us that three Days after the  Success  parted with the  Spanish  Man of War another  Algerine  Rover met with them and took 'em after an obstinate Fight the Captain and several others being slain in the Battle It was his good Fortune to be bought for the Emperor's Use I call it good Fortune said he because I was presented to the  French  Ambassador and am now in Hopes of my Freedom  I told the Ambassador in  French  what he said and he was pleas'd to say that to oblige me he would take him into his Protection I remember'd  Mahumet ben Addo Otar  was Ambassador in  England  He came to visit the Ambassador often and understanding  English  I gather'd several good Hints for his Design for he was courteous enough though an Enemy in his Heart to the  English  I think it will not be much amiss here to give the Reader a succinct Account of the Customs and Manners of the  Moors  of  Fez  and  Morocco  and we will first begin from their last Revolution  Muley Ismael  the present Emperor of  Morocco  pretends to derive his Birth from  Mahomet  himself He was Son to  Muley Xerif  King of  Taphilet  but was succeeded by  Muley Archyd  who dy'd with a Debauch he made among his Courtiers  His unexpected Death in gave room for many of his Family to raise Rebellion in their several Provinces But  Muley Ismael  being the greatest Favourite of the People and of an enterprising Temper proclaim'd himself King of  Taphilet  and seiz'd his Brother's Treasures which are the Sinews of War His Nephew  Muley Hamet  gave him the most Trouble for he had gain'd a Party and declar'd himself King of  Sus  and  Morocco  had several Battels but at last was overcome as well as the rest and  Ismael  was settled the peaceful King of  Taphilet Morocco  and  Fez  I have given a Description of his Person already His Empire spreads from North to South four hundred Leagues from East to West upwards of a hundred and fifty  There are three strong Places possess'd by the  Europeans  on the Coast of  Afric  First  Magazan  on the Ocean by the  Portuguese  and on the  Mediterranean Melissa  and  Ceuta  by the  Spaniards  They had two more strong Holds  Larache  and  Mammora  but the present Emperor drove them out shamefully And  Tangier  once belong'd to the  English  who abandon'd it a few Years ago first demolishing the Fortifications  The Emperor has but nine SeaPorts in his whole Dominions viz  Sancta Cruz Safy Sallee Mammora Larache Arzilla  and  Tangier  on the  Afric  Ocean  Zaffarina  and  Tetuan  on the  Mediterranean  though  Tetuan  is two Leagues within Land To begin in Order as they are nam'd  Sancta Cruz  or the  Holy Cross  is the first Port to the Southward The Town is about a Mile in Length and a Quarter broad The chief Merchants are  Jews  who trade with  England  and  Holland  Their Vent is Hides Dates Copper and Beeswax  Safy  or  Sophia  appears next a Town situated on a Hill but drives a larger Trade than  Sancta Cruz  Sallee  situated Leagues S W of  Cape Spartel  It is divided into two Towns the old and the new it is called by the Natives  Arbat  There's a very good Harbour and a strong Castle well stor'd with Guns if the  Moors  knew how to make use of them The Town is large and well inhabited but the Walls are all demolish'd I observ'd the Ruins of a Church the Steeple yet standing a noble fine  Gothic  Building The chief Trade of this Town consists in the Prizes that are brought in by their Gallies  About seven Leagues more to the North stands  Mammora  once possessed by the  Spaniards  It stands in a Bottom surrounded with Mountains which renders the Air very unwholsome by reason of the excessive Heat but the Bay is fine large and secure from all Winds This Town is generally the high Road to  Mequinez  the present Capital of  Morocco  The next Port Northward is  Larache  a Town of a pleasant Situation and strongly fortified but to the eternal Infamy of the  Spaniards  deliver'd  up to  Ismael  after a Siege of five Moons two thousand Soldiers and a hundred Officers taken Prisoners a sufficient Force to have defended it against the whole Powers of  Muley Ismael  for they neither wanted Provisions nor Ammunition But we shall leave them and their Cowardice and go on to  Arzilla  or  Azilath  about twelve Leagues more North A Place only fam'd for Tobacco which they seldom trade abroad for having sufficient Vent for it among the Natives of  Morocco  and as we have but little Business with it we'll come to  Tangier  as fast as we can a fine large wellfortified City when in the Hands of the  English  but since they have left it and raz'd the Fortifications the  Moors  have not thought fit to repair it  The next  Zaffarina  is a Place of very little Note and therefore we shall make no Observation concerning it  The last is  Tetuan  a Town six Miles within Land without any Fortification The Inhabitans came originally from the Province of  Andalusia  in  Spain  as indeed did most of the  Moors  on the SeaCoasts of  Africa  They are white Men pretty well civiliz'd very kind to Strangers and Christians and pay but little Regard to the Emperor of  Morocco  As to the Nature of the Inhabitants they are most of a tawny Complexion of a lazy idle Disposition and curs'd with all the Vices of Mankind mistrustful to the last Degree false jealous and the very Picture of Ignorance They style themselves  Mussulmen  or true Believers yet their Word is not to be rely'd upon on any Occasion The  Moors  are generally but indifferent Soldiers and but seldom brave They  are often fam'd in the  Spanish  Histories for Men of Gallantry but I could never find them inclin'd that way They manage a Horse it must be confest with a great deal of Dexterity They abominate the Christians for the very Word signifies in their Language  Dog  and are continually seeking Means to destroy them  Mahomet  has taught 'em in his  Alcoran  that all of his Faith who dye fighting against the Christians immediately enter into Paradise in Triumph nay even their Horses if they did in Battle are immediately translated into Heaven for they hope to have the Pleasure of Riding there as well as on Earth  Though Poligamy is allow'd yet they must marry but four Wives and must settle a Dowry upon them and if they ever put 'em away they must return their Dowry along with 'em But they may keep as many Concubines as they think fit tho' they have this Privilege when they can please 'em no longer they sell 'em to the best Bidder so that the Women of  Morocco  in my Opinion have but a sad Time on't yet the Husband is oblig'd to keep all their Children They esteem Ideots and Naturals to be Saints if they are Men for they believe the Women have no Souls and are only form'd for Propagation They will not allow 'em to enter their Mosques because they esteem 'em uncapable of being receiv'd into Heaven Yet they say their Prayers at home and on  Fridays  resort to the Places of Burial to weep over the Graves of their deceas'd Friends cloath'd in Blue which is their Mourning They hire profess'd Mourners to grieve and cry at the Graves of Relations and howl over them as I have heard the  Irish  asking them why they would die when they were provided with every thing that was  necessary in this World Their Time is spent in Eating Drinking Sleeping Dallying with their Women Horses and Prayers for they never learn to read and are forbid Gaming and even their Prayers are hurried over so slothfully as if they were asleep  They have usually a String of Beads in their Hands like the  Roman Catholicks  and to every Bead they have a short Prayer which as they repeat they drop through their Fingers The Prayer consists only in the different Attributes of God as  God is great God is good God is infinite God is merciful  The Emperor of these Wretches only differs from his Subjects in a larger Propensity to their ill Qualities with the Addition of a degree of Cruelty and Avarice I was told that during his twenty Years Reign he had murder'd with his own Hands twenty three thousand Men Nay I am apt to believe the Truth of it for he put forty seven to Death in the one and twenty Days we were at his Court  Every Nation is amaz'd to find his Subjects so submissive and patient under so excessive and cruel a Tyranny But they should understand bating their Want of Power that they are taught to believe if they fall by the Hand of a King who is a  Xerif  which signifies  Mahomet  's Successor they immediately go up to Heaven and if there is any that would not willingly be sent to Heaven before their Time they are sure to fly him when he is cloath'd in Yellow which is his Colour of Murder and he generally dyes it of a Bloodcolour before he goes to Sleep  As I was viewing some new Buildings one Day near the King's Palace I perceiv'd him giving Directions to some of the Workmen There were several Carts drove by his Slaves  with Materials for his Building and as they pass'd him he bastinado'd some for going too fast while others thinking to mend that Fault were drubb'd by him for going too slow one poor Creature trembling for fear of what would follow went bowing before his Cart but the Emperor wounding the Horse in the Flank he gave a Spring tumbled the Wretch down and drove over him Another following him ran to assist his Fellow but the Emperor threw his Dart and struck him in the Shoulder The Slave drew it out and upon his Knees presented it to him again which the Emperor when the Man had got some Distance from him darted into his Chine The Fool drew it out once more and cover'd with Blood gave it to him back again but as he was stooping he fell down with loss of Blood at the Barbarian's Feet who did him the Favour to pin him to the Earth through his Back  I was so shock'd at the Sight that I could not recover my self for a good while afterwards I thought the poor Fellow was a Fool for if it had been my own Case I would have return'd it through his Body the first Time for he was sure of Dying and I think it would have been some Satisfaction to have sent the Author of my Death the same Journey  This King us'd to murder his Slaves upon the least Complaint from the  Moors  which they would make out of hatred to Christians But the Wretch finding his Slaves decrease too much took another Method and when the next Complaint was made he killed the Slave the Person complain'd against but order'd the Complainant immediately to pay him double the Price he cost him or find him two more Slaves in his Room that Instant which he was oblig'd to do but  this Proceeding stopt their Mouths for the future  They say he has a great deal of Wit and Courage is very active and expert in riding and hurling the Dart He drinks no Wine because his Religion forbids it but when he takes Opium or drinks a certain Mixture that he makes himself compounded with Brandy Cinamon Cloves Anniseed and Nutmegs woe be to him that comes in his Way He's much addicted to Women having no less than four hundred Concubines He has one hundred and eighteen Male Children alive and about two hundred Females One of the Males whom he designs for his Successor and which he had by a Black who advises him in every thing and is reckon'd a politic Woman he has named  Muley Zeyden  His Revenue consists in Presents from the Governors of his Provinces and the  Arabians  who live in Huts about his Dominions When he has a mind to squeeze he sends for a Governor from his Province who knows well enough what he is sent to for and therefore provides accordingly so that the Emperor fleeces the Governors and they fleece the People So that there is no one rich but himself and yet he does not know what Use to put his Treasure to but hides it in secret Places and the Person that assists him in the Concealment is sure to lose his Life for his Assistance  Mequinez  the Capital and the Place of his Residence was formerly but a small Village but now it contains six hundred thousand Inhabitants and the Streets are so crowded there's hardly any passing along It is but a mean City very ill built and if there falls any Rain the dirtiest Place I ever set my Foot in for there is no Pavement in the Streets and when it is dry the Dust is ready to choak one The King's  Palace is indeed a very large Place almost four Miles round including his Gardens but it is very ill contriv'd Here you shall see a fine Pillar added to support an old ruinated Place and yet he employs most of his Time in Building In short it looks like gold Lace upon a Hopsack  His Stables are the most regular Building in all his Palace But that's no wonder for the  Moors  even reverence Horses and one that has been a Pilgrimage to  Mecca  has as much Veneration as the Pilgrim himself The King had one of these Horses which I have seen always finely caparison'd and a Slave to attend who carry'd a Pot and a Cloth to keep him Clean All the Horses that are thus sanctify'd are usually freed from all manner of Service and if the Owner cannot afford to keep it which often happens there is a Pension settled upon 'em by the  Mufty  The  Jews  drive a great Trade here but they pay sufficiently for that Privilege for they are oblig'd to wear black Caps that they may be distinguish'd and notwithstanding their great Trade they are but scurvily us'd for if a Child insults 'em it is as much as their Lives are worth to resist  The Women of  Morocco  I mean all that I had the Fortune to see were very handsome fine large full Eyes round Faces and every Feature exact They are very amorous and dexterous in contriving Methods to satisfie their Desires  A Gentleman of our Retinue told me he had got an Intrigue with one of the  Moorish  Women Daughter to a Governor of a Province and his manner of going to the Appointment was in Disguise She sent him by a  French  Slave of hers a complete Woman's Dress which are  generally all alike and their Faces are all muffled up to their Eyes so that they are often met by their own▪ Husbands in the Street without being known by this Dress he got Admittance as a Lady coming to pay a Visit and then they are very secure For it is the Custom whenever a Man even the Husband finds a pair of Women's Sandals at the Door of his Wife's Chamber he must retire for it is the greatest Affront they can put on a Woman to enter her Apartment when they have that Warning to the contrary He told me she was a delicious Creature and Mistress of the whole Art of Love It is no wonder if they give themselves up to Love when perhaps there are twenty or more according to the Capacity of the Person that keeps 'em Sharers in one single Man and they must be contented to stay for due Benevolence till their Tyrant pleases to send for 'em  The Habit of the Men is generally White which is a Colour they extreamly delight in with a red Cap on their Heads that is the married Men for all the Youth from the Prince to the Beggar before Wedlock go uncover'd They are close shav'd under their Caps excepting one Lock upon the Crown of their Heads which they never cut off being they are taught by that Lock  Mahomet  is to draw 'em up to their imaginary Paradise They only shave under their Chins but suffer their Beards and Mustachoes to grow which they take a particular Pride in the Length or Largeness of and he that's well bearded  must  be a wise Man  Their Shirts are made like Shifts only the Sleeves are so long that they hang down over their Hands Under the Shirt they were linen Drawers that reach down to their Knees for their Legs are always bare their Shoes are made  without Heels like  Irish  Brogues Over the Shirt is a Vest without Sleeves which they surround with a silk Scarf of what Colour they please except Green which is a Colour sacred to  Mahomet  their Emperor and the Clergy in this they thrust short Daggers or Knives Over all is a Garment which they call a  Hayick  about five Ells long and four broad which they wrap round 'em as we do our Cloaks Some of the meaner Sort especially in the Country wear Strawhats of their own Make Their Dresses are all alike only some add a gold or silver Fringe round the Border  As for Religion they rise early and late to Prayers but only like Children do it because they are order'd Their  Mufti  or Head of their Religion is reckon'd the first in the Empire and disowns the Emperor's Authority but yet he finds means to fleece him as well as the rest of his Subjects who obey him out of Fear for if there was one Person found to love him it would be as strange a Sight as one of their Monsters  I could not forbear smiling to see the Providence of the  Moors  Walking one Day about a Mile from  Mequinez  it began to rain prodigiously I got under a Tree to shelter my self from the Tempest But I observ'd several of the Natives undress themselves with a great deal of Precipitation make up their Cloaths in a Bundle and sit on 'em stark naked and all their Care was to keep 'em from the Wet leaving their naked Bodies expos'd to the Fury of the Storm When it ceas'd they walk'd a little Way till their Bodies were dry and then dress'd themselves If a Man were to do so in  England  he would be counted a Madman or a Fool yet I must own I thought 'em in the right for be the Storm ever so violent  yet when it's over they pursue their Journey with dry Cloaths on their Backs But they have one Conveniency they are drest and undrest in half a Minute Nay I am inform'd those that travel on Camels or on Horseback have a Conveniency cover'd with an oyl'd Cloth in which they thrust their Cloaths on the like Occasion and ride naked I fancy to meet an Army in a Storm would create a terrible Fright and do as much Execution to an Ignorant Body as their offensive Arms and force 'em to seek for Safety in their Heels  The Emperor is able to raise an hundred thousand Horse and fifty thousand Foot When they are to make War among themselves they go very unwillingly into the Field but when they oppose the Christians they do it with a great deal of Chearfulness because they expect Indulgences for the Expiation of their Sins When they are ready to give Battle they range their Armies after this Manner They divide their Horse into two Bodies and place one at each Wing the Foot is in the Middle so that the whole forms a Crescent or half Moon Before they begin the Battle they give a great Shout then make a short Prayer and fall on without much Order very furiously so that they soon overcome or are as soon put to flight Break but their foremost Ranks and you put their whole Body into Confusion  I have said before that no Person is rich but the Emperor neither do they take the Methods to be so or if they are their greatest Wisdom will be to conceal it for if once known they are sure to lose all their Wealth  No Foreign Coin is currant in  Morocco  except  Spanish  Pieces of Eight which are only receiv'd by Weight But the  Jews  will secretly  take any Coin and I suppose dispose of it again with the same Circumspection they receive it They have but three sorts of Coin currant among 'em The first a  Ducat  of  Barbary  Gold Second a  Blanquile  of  Silver  And last a  Felowze  of Copper The Image of the Emperor is not allow'd to be put on their Money being expresly forbid by  Mahomet  in his  Alcoran  but they stamp 'em with  Arabian  Characters Their way of reckoning is by the Ounce  These are the Heads of what I observ'd in my small Stay among 'em The Ambassador inform'd me he was in some fear that his Embassy would not succeed for he said he found little else but Delays Excuses and nothing of Sincerity among 'em We were inform'd that the Emperor design'd to go speedily upon an Expedition against the  Moors  of the Province of  Oran  who had newly revolted and put to Death their Governor for his Avarice he having extorted from 'em vast Sums of Money and the Inhabitants after his Death chose one of their own Province to command 'em This hasten'd our Ambassador in his Legation to get an Answer one way or other But we were inform'd the King design'd to set out the next Day upon his Expedition and yet the Ambassador had not his Audience of Leave This made him and us very uneasy for we could not stir from  Mequinez  without the Emperor's express Leave But about seven in the Evening the Ambassador had Orders to come and take his last Audience which was the ninth of  June  We went in the same Manner as we did at first But we were inform'd by our Interpreter that the King was in a very ill Humour and that he had but an Hour before kill'd two of his chief Blacks  by stabbing 'em with a Dagger he continually wore at his Girdle  We enter'd the Palace further than the first Time where we waited a full half Hour At last the Emperor approach'd richly drest and finely mounted upon a white  Barbary  the Saddle and other Accoutrements wrought with Gold and precious Stones in several Places He was this Day in his Yellow or Fatal Vest and sprinkled in many Places with the Blood of those he had slain and I thought his Countenance had something more of Horror in't than at our first Audience He had a Spear in his Hand set round with Pearls on the Top and a Cap with Estriches Feathers waving in the Wind All his Attendants had fled his Presence at the Notice of his having on his yellow Vest and he had only about a dozen of his Guards waiting upon him trembling but the  Alcaydes  and other great Men crept about us during our Audience  The Emperor begun with his old Compliment of  You're wellcome  but his Looks and his Words I thought did but ill agree The Ambassador us'd many Arguments with him to bring his Embassy to a happy Issue but to no Purpose The Ambassador told me the King was a Person that had not the least Regard to his Word and even disown'd a Letter he had written to his Master the King of  France  Therefore said he we'll take our leave of this Country of Monsters in two Days for the King had sign'd his Departure with all his Retinue  I was very well pleas'd with this his Resolution for now I should once more see that Treasure of my Soul whose Absence had robb'd me of all Joy I even thought these two Days the  longest of my Life but at last they were past and we set out very merrily at least I did and all the rest of the Retinue Tho' I must own I could not answer for the Ambassador for I believe the ill Success of his Embassy had a little chagrin'd him I did my utmost Endeavour to divert his Melancholy upon the Road which he took very kindly We lay in Tents the first Night which the Ambassador had taken care to provide us and Provision likewise for there is never an Inn between  Mequinez  and  Mammora  We rose the next Day very early that we might avoid the Heat of the Sun When we came within a League of the Town we saw coming towards us our  Italian  and by the Melancholy in his Looks I began to tremble with Apprehension of some Accident Assoon as he approach'd us after paying his Obedience to the Ambassador he address'd himself to me Said he in  French  I wish some one else would have taken my Commission upon 'em for what I have to tell you will cut you to the Heart The various Troubles in my Breast lock'd up my Tongue so that I had not Power to ask him any Questions In short said he your Mistress is forc'd away from us through the Treachery of  Mustapha  At hearing this fatal News I drop'd senseless from my  Camel  nor came to my self till we arriv'd at  Mammora  I was a thousand times going to destroy my self and I believe I had done it in the height of my Despair if I had not been withheld In short the Ambassador was no longer ignorant of my cruel Loss For in my Ravings I had call'd her my dear Wife He seem'd amaz'd at the Discovery and reproach'd me in a handsome Manner for not trusting him with the Secret I was not in a  Condition to beg his Pardon neither was there any one could give me Comfort I was carry'd on Board where I enquir'd in what manner she was taken away  The Captain inform'd us that  Mustapha  had made his Escape out of the Cabin Window by swimming I did not tell any one of it said the Captain because I thought it would be to no Purpose for I imagin'd there could be no other ill Consequence to attend his Escape but meerly the Loss of him He had been gone three Days when on the fourth there came on board us the Governor of  Mammora  the Fugitive  Mustapha  and one hundred Soldiers who immediately seiz'd on the young Gentleman whom they said was a Woman and Wise to a Renegado of  Sallee  It was in vain to oppose 'em especially when I found by her Breasts that she was really a Woman They took her on Shore notwithflanding all her Cries Shrieks and Lamentations which pierc'd our very Hearts They put her on board a  Saick  and set Sail immediately steering South as we suppose for the Port of  Sallee  This Gentleman meaning the  Italian  took it upon him to acquaint you with the unhappy Accident but added he I believe it is not possible to regain her The Ambassador was so good as to offer his Assistance in what lay in his Power I begg'd he would be pleas'd to lend me a Boat with some Hands to work her He very willingly granted my Request and told me he would lend me the Ship but he fear'd it might occasion a more publick Quarrel  He lent me ten Hands four Patareros and sufficient small Arms with every thing that was necessary My kind  Italian  would accompany me and the rest of the Company went Voluntary We spent but little time in fitting out  and the Wind proving favourable we set Sail and made very good Way The  Saick  had not pursu'd her Voyage above five Hours before us so that we had hopes of getting up with 'em I encourag'd my Companions who labour'd incessantly We sail'd and row'd all Night and when the Morning dawn'd we gain'd Sight of a Vessel which we did not doubt was that we sought for We labour'd hard to come up with her and gain'd upon her every Moment Before eight aclock we came a long side of her and I soon discover'd  Mustapha  giving Orders about the Engagement I drew out a pair of Pistols and shot him dead The rest fir'd upon us but notwithstanding all their Opposition I jump'd into their Vessel follow'd by the  Italian  and five more of the Men And tho' they were superior in Number yet we soon made 'em ask for Quarter I upon the Instant enquir'd for her that was always in my Thoughts but to my great Grief was inform'd by an  English  Slave at the Oar that she was taken on board of a Galley by Captain  Hamet  our  Irish  Renegado and they assured me it was impossible for 'em to be overtaken Unspeakable was the Sorrow I felt at this Relation and all the Satisfaction I felt was that I had rewarded  Mustapha  for his Treachery We steer'd our Course back but I was more dead than alive in the Voyage  When we came on Board the Ambassador condol'd with me for my Misfortune and entreated me to take Comfort I told him Death was now my only Comfort and I hop'd he was not far off  Our  Italian  had agreed for his Passage on board a Vessel in the Bay bound for  Rome  He begg'd that I would accompany him into  Italy  and when he had settled his Affairs he would if it lay in his Power come back to  Sallee  and do his Endeavour to find what was become of Mrs  Villars  I thank'd him for his Offer and told him I would accept of it I had Effects enough having all the Money and Jewels we brought from  Hamet  's CountryHouse We took leave of the Ambassador and gave him abundance of Thanks for his Civilities and went on board the Vessel that waited for us we set Sail immediately and in two Months safely arriv'd at  Rome  where our  Italian  did not care to go publickly on Shore but stay'd till the Darkness of the Night favour'd our Landing  We had all our Goods disembark'd and took a Private Lodging in an obscure Part of the City where we were sure of being conceal'd We ask'd our Landlord who was a  Frenchman  about the News of the Place He told us a great deal of idle stuff which signify'd nothing to us at last by the Advice of the  Italian  I enquir'd of him if  Hernando Alvares  were in Town or no He answer'd me that he had been dead above two Months and had left a noble Estate behind him I ask'd him if he had not left a Wife to possess it No said he  About three Years ago continu'd our Landlord he was to have been marry'd to a beautiful young Lady an Heiress to a vast Fortune but his Brother stept in between and gain'd her Affection Some say they were marry'd and others not but she was deliver'd of a fine Boy Don  Hernando  took a barbarous Revenge of his Brother as it is reported He brib'd a Captain of a Vessel to put a Weight about his Neck and drown him in the Sea But to make amends for this inhuman Act he has left his vast Estate to the Son his Brother had by the Lady and has chosen his Holiness the  Pope  for his Guardian Pray said I what's become of the young Lady He answer'd me he  could not tell but it is suppos'd she was gone into a Nunnery  The  Italian  while our Discourse lasted had turn'd his Face to the Window that we might not perceive the Disorder of his Countenance Assoon as our Landlord was gone he turn'd to me and embrac'd me said he My dear Friend let what will happen to me I shall have it in my Power to serve you with my Fortune and so much I think my self obliged to you that if half will buy your Mistress's Liberty you shall command it I return'd him the Acknowledgments his kind Proffer deserv'd but told him I could not expect to be so happy He bid me not despair I begg'd he would not mention any thing of my Affairs till his own came to a lucky Issue  The next Day we procur'd our selves Habits after the Mode of  Rome  and resolv'd to go to  Grimaldi  's CountryHouse to hear if it were possible some Tidings of  Isabella  Antonio  had drest himself in a mean Habit and appear'd as my Servant It being but six pleasant Miles we had resolv'd to walk it We enter'd a Village within half a Mile of the Place and resolv'd to dine at a poor Inn there to gain some Intelligence I went for a  French  Merchant and Don  Antonio  pass'd as I said for my Servant and Interpreter and inform'd me of the Discourse that past between 'em That Gentleman meaning me says he to our Host has some Business to communicate to Don  Antonio Grimaldi  for we knew of his being there Our Innkeeper told us it would be a difficult Matter to talk to him about Business now for he was that very Evening going to set out with his Daughter in order to put her into a Nunnery at  Naples  for all his Persuasions added he cannot prevail upon her  but she is fixt unalterably in her Resolution This News you may be sure hasten'd our Departure but we did not well know how to disclose the Secret we had to unfold  Don  Antonio  as not doubting  Isabella  's Affection to him was fearful lest an abrupt Discovery should have some strange Effect upon her We therefore resolv'd that I should first appear and break the Matter by degrees for he had inform'd me that she spoke  French  very well When we approach'd the House  Antonio  stood at some Distance while I went up to the Door alone The Porter and I not understanding one another I had like to have return'd as wise as I came But at last a Servant in the Family happening to understand  French  came and ended our sputt'ring at one another I inform'd him I had a Secret of the greatest Importance to declare to  Donna Isabella  He told me he would acquaint his Lord with it The Servant went in and immediately return'd with a grave old Gentleman that seem'd to have been weeping He ask'd me in  French  what I had to say to his Daughter for she did not care to speak to any one I begg'd that I might be brought to her Presence and did not doubt but that I had something to say to her which would not displease her Don  Antonio Grimaldi  gravely smill'd and shook his Head No no Sir said he you have nothing to give either her or me Comfort unless you could revive the Dead I answered him he did not know what I could do But I told him the longer he delay'd my seeing her the longer he deferr'd their own Happiness Well said he I have no Hopes but you shall see my Daughter to convince you that nothing in this World can make us Happy  He led me through several stately Apartments all hung with Black And though it was high Noon yet the Sun's Light was excluded and dim twinkling Lamps usurp'd his Room At last we enter'd a Chamber where sat the fair Forlorn I stop'd a Moment to behold her and notwithstanding a fixt Melancholy on her Countenance Beauty triumph'd there She was caressing an Infant she had in her Arms The Father enter'd first and told her in  French  that a Gentleman of  France  had a Secret to communicate to her that would banish her Melancholy The Gentleman return'd the Lady may promise Impossibilities but rather than expose him I would beg him not to open his Mouth upon that Subject Madam said I I own my self a Physician but I pretend to cure the Mind as well as the Body and to acquaint you with what you know already you mourn the Loss of a Gentleman that you imagine was drown'd at Sea But I can assure you he escap'd that Danger and is now a Captive in  Barbary  pining under the severest Want and all the Hope he has of Freedom is through your Means  The Lady upon this look'd wishfully upon her Father and said Dear Father don't endeavour to deceive me any longer you know I have your Promise and my Time's expir'd My dear Child I am amaz'd as much as you can be return'd the Father for by all that's Holy I never saw this Gentleman in my Life before and am so far from believing him that begging his Pardon I fancy there must be some very great Mistake in't Upon this I related to them all his Story from the beginning to our meeting in  Barbary  I found my Relation had stagger'd her Faith a little for a pleasing Hope rectify'd by powerful  Fear rose in her beautiful Face and she threw her self at my Feet notwithstanding all my Endeavours to the contrary Dear Sir said she do not show me this light of Comfort to put it out and plunge me into eternal Darkness Madam said I by Heaven and heavenly Powers I have seen him within these two Months and what I have related to you his own Mouth inform'd me and having gain'd my Liberty I made him a Promise to see his Friends in  Italy  and inform them of his Condition The Transports and Ecstasies that took Possession of both their Souls cannot be express'd by Words they embrac'd me kiss'd me call'd me their Preserver Unlook'dfor Happiness said  Isabella  Heaven thou hast heard my Prayers and does my dear  Antonio  live I'll immediately imbark for  Barbary  and fetch him thence my self Even all that I am worth my precious Boy shall sell his Fortune too to redeem his Father O my young  Antonio  Heaven has restor'd thy Father from the Dead said she to her Child and I hope we shall see him again The pretty Innocent mingled his Tears of Joy with theirs After their first Transports were over they again embrac'd me and begg'd I would put 'em in a way to pay me the Obligations they ow'd me Then they proceeded to enquire which way they must go about to accomplish his Liberty I told 'em I had a Servant waiting without that I intended should accompany the Persons they would send to manage the Affair They seem'd to reproach me for letting him wait without and were immediately sending for him in I begg'd they would give me leave to go for him my self being he was a Foreigner and they would find it a hard matter to make him understand them Upon this I ran out and call'd to  Antonio  and  told him in few Words how things stood He follow'd me close at the Heels I went into the Room first and as  Antonio Grimaldi  was giving him his Hand to lead him in he fell upon his Knees before him  Isabella  casting her Eyes upon him gave a Shriek and cry'd out 'Tis he 'tis he himself my dear  Antonio  Joy took away her Speech and she fell down in a Trance He ran and caught her in his Arms kiss'd and embrac'd her and at last brought her to herself Imagination must make up the Discourse between 'em He told her at last when Words of Sense took Place that he was obliged to me for his Liberty for he had sent several Letters to his Sisters but never could get any Answer They inform'd him that both his Sisters were gone to reside at  Venice  with their Husbands and that was the Reason his Letters never came to their Hands Now said  Antonio  if my Friend meaning me was but happy it would compleat my Joy But to find a Wife a Son and Father kind when I had many Reasons to think the contrary must have some Alloy or it would not be possible for me to bear it  Antonio  upon this related my unhappy Story and they all lamented my hard Fortune He afterwards enquir'd of his dear  Isabella  concerning her own Sufferings Which she readily began  Said she that Day you left me the Troubles of my Mind wrought so much upon my Body that the Physicians declar'd I was in a violent Fever and advis'd my Father to send me into the Country which he accordingly did the next Day The Thoughts of being so far from my dear  Antonio  encreas'd my Malady and my Father had little Hopes of my Life My Fever after having brought me to the brink of the Grave left me And my Father imagining it was  the approaching Marriage had wrought this sudden Illness told me one Day that if it was that which lay so heavy upon my Spirits he would remove it by giving me the Power of refusing to be the Wife of  Hernando Alvarez  I thank'd him and told him he had taken the only way to restore my Health and that if I was forc'd to wed him I should be for ever miserable He was the tenderest of Fathers and inform'd me he would never force my Inclinations The Kindness my Father shew'd me work'd so much upon me that I began to recover  Your Brother us'd often to visit me in my Illness which retarded my Health My Father seeing it would never be in my Power to like him very frankly told him so and begg'd that he would discontinue his Visits for he was resolv'd his Daughter should never give her Hand where it was not in her Power to give her Heart They parted with many Words between them but my Father persisted in his Resolution  I began to discover that I was with Child and a new Sort of an Illness seiz'd me I knew this was an Accident that could not long be conceal'd therefore I resolv'd to let you know my Condition and I gain'd my Woman by several Promises of a Reward to deliver a Letter to you But she betray'd me to your Brother which I suspected from her not appearing I therefore declar'd the Truth to my indulgent Father He was very much enrag'd at the Discovery but paternal Love prevailing over his Passion he forgave me and promis'd to make me happy with my dear  Antonio  These Promises made my Sickness vanish and I had no other Disease but what attends breeding Women My Father went to  Rome  to enquire for  Don Antonio  but could not get the least Information  of him This gave me a new Shock But what bitter Agonies did I feel when I receiv'd a Letter from your Brother with a Copy of that I had written to you enclos'd which was as follows  UNgrateful Woman Yet I will no more upbraid thee but let thy Crime be thy Punishment He that betray'd me I will not call by the Name of Brother He has paid for his Ingratitude with his Life I only give thee this Notice that thou may'st feel some of those Pangs thou hast thrust into the Breast of  Hernando Alvares  The Reading of this Letter sunk me down and I call'd for Death as my last and only Hope I resolv'd to refuse all Food and had starv'd my self to Death if a good Priest had not convinc'd me by his Arguments my Soul was in Danger and I should be guilty of a double Murder my self and Infant I lingred on in a restless State of Unhappiness till the Time of my Delivery came which I pray'd to Heaven to end with my Life But it pleas'd the Almighty Power to spare me to be happy  The Sight of my precious Infant call'd to Mind the Loss of his Father but I resolv'd to banish all Thoughts of Death that I might take Care of his tender Years But I begg'd my Father to give me leave to go into a Nunnery With much Importunity he granted my Request on this Condition that if I continued in that Mind at the End of two Years I might do as I thought fit Tho' I thought the Time an Age yet I unwillingly consented  My Father us'd Means with the  Pope  to have your Brother call'd to an Account for  your Death and it had gone hard with him if we could have procur'd any Witnesses but for Want of that he was acquitted In a litle time a heavy and deep Melancholy seiz'd him and he profess'd so sincere a Repentance that even I almost forgave him He begg'd he might see the Child which my Father made me comply with He shed such abundance of Tears over it that my Father wept for Company and spoke so tenderly of the Loss of his Brother that wip'd off all Suspicions of his Repentance Since thou hast lost a Father said he through my Barbarity it is but just that I should prove a Father to thee He frequently came to see him though I could never be prevail'd upon to accept of a Visit At last his Grief seiz'd him so violently that he was given over by his Physicians When he was upon his DeathBed he made his Will and bequeath'd my little  Antonio  his whole Estate leaving the Pope his Guardian He dy'd full of Repentance for his Crime and no doubt his Soul took her Flight to Heaven  The generous  Antonio  could not refuse some Tears to the Memory of his repentant Brother but Joy succeeded Sorrow The  Pope  was acquainted with the Story who sent to congratulate their happy Meeting Nothing but Mirth and Pleasure ran through the  Villa  which increas'd my Sorrow  Don Antonio  told me one Day that he did not think he had a Right to rejoice without me and now said he I have nothing to afflict me but what you feel therefore will bend my Thoughts if it be possible to relieve your Grief I can procure a Fryar of my Acquaintance to go to  Sallee  one that knows the Nature of the Business we shall send him about being he has  often gone to redeem Captives We'll send for him and you may give him what Instructions you think fit I thank'd him and was very sorry for the Trouble I should give him but was resolv'd to accompany him my self He told me he would not have me go by any means for I could be of no manner of Use in the Affair but rather a Hindrance and if I should be once discovered might fall into the same State we both lately escap'd from and perhaps meet with much worse Usage than I had before His Advice was so reasonable that I resolv'd to take it whatever Violence I did my self The Fryar was sent for bad his Commission and Instructions given him and withal to spare no Cost  Antonio  told him whatever he gave should not be thought unreasonable  He was to have a thousand Crowns for his Expences and two thousand more if he succeeded  The Fryar undertook his Voyage with a great deal of Alacrity and gave us great Hopes of his Success by his Willingness and he embark'd the next Day for  Genoa  that Port being the properest Place to get a Vessel for  Barbary  We wish'd him a good Voyage and recommended him to Fortune  Don Antonio  did all he could to divert my Melancholy We often went a hunting shooting fishing and visiting the Ladies In short he made me partake in all the Diversions  Italy  could afford But though I seem'd often to be diverted yet I had always my Condition too much at Heart to be merry We view'd all the Rarities and Antiquities of ancient and modern  Rome  I must confess these Amusements lull'd my Sorrows often but when I had Time for Reflection they rush'd upon me with the greater Force  I shall not trouble my Reader in describing Places treated on by Pens far above my weak Capacity but only give a short Description of  Naples  whither  Don Antonio  would have me go I was not much averse to the Journey though a pretty long one and we set out with a very handsom Equipage  Donna Isabella  with her little Son accompany'd us but  Don Antonio Grimaldi  was oblig'd to attend the  Pope  to settle the Affairs of his Soninlaw's Estate I was oblig'd to appear chearful if it was but in Complaisance to  Don Antonio  We arriv'd at  Naples  in three Days without meeting any thing extraordinary upon the Road Certainly never any City in the World can boast a finer Situation Add to that their Buildings are sumptuous every private House seems a Palace and every Palace looks like the Court of a King The Streets spacious a mild Air and free from Tempests strong both by Art and Nature In short if I was obliged to live out of my native Country which every Man is fond of  Naples  should be the only Place It has a Wall kept in very good Repair with three Castles almost impregnable The chief is seated on Mount  Erasmus  so call'd from a Chappel dedicated to him But if it is  Erasmus Roterdamus  I can't imagine how the  Roman Catholicks  came to have such a particular Regard for him when it is very well known he was no great Friend to them at least he was a Scourge to their Absurdities in his Writings  This is not only a Safeguard to the City and adjacent Country but might prove its Scourge In it was blown up by Lightning penetrating to the Powder Room which mightily damag'd the whole City The second  is  Castello nuevo  or the new Castle built by  Charles  King of  Naples  This Castle commands the Haven and is generally the Viceroy's Dwelling The third stands on the Southeast Corner of the City built upon a little Rock join'd to the Continent by  Lucullus  the  Roman  and is sometimes call'd by his Name but oftner  Castello del Ovo  or the Castle of the Egg from its Form They have also a fine Arsenal for their Gallies very well kept and furnish'd with great Store of Ammunition But I think the Mole the most extraordinary Piece of Work being it defends the Haven from the stormy South lin'd of each Side and pav'd on the Top with noble square Stones and in the middle a fine large Fountain of Marble the whole Extent is five hundred Paces and ten in Breadth The Inhabitants often boast of the Antiquity of their City founded twenty years after  Troy  's Destruction and call'd by the antient Poets  Parthenope  which  Virgil  does sufficiently testify in his  Georgics  Ille Virgilium me Tempore dulcis alebat  Parthenope  studiis florentem ignobilis otî  This City has suffer'd many Revolutions but none more extraordinary than that in when a poor Fisherman without Shoes to his Feet in five Days time commanded the whole Power of  Naples  and might have liv'd in that Grandeur if his Mind had chang'd with his exalted State but he was still a Fisherman His shortliv'd Fire blaz'd too fierce to last and he fell a Victim to the Rage he himself began  Their Churches are noble Structures and beautify'd with Paintings by the best Hands Their Women are most of 'em beautiful but  my Heart had no Room to think of them  The City is govern'd by very wholesom Laws but one particular Article adds much to the Quiet of it none are suffer'd to wear Swords but those of the Garrisons so if there's any Rencounter in the Streets a Bout at FistyCuffs generally ends the Dispute Tho' Bravo's are to be hir'd to do a Murder here as cheap as at  Rome  and Men of Honour too for we heard of a Quarrel between two  Neapolitan  Gentlemen where one according to Custom hir'd a Bravo to murder the other and gave him his Reward beforehand But it so fell out that some Friends to both Parties reconcil'd the two Gentlemen The Person that had bargain'd with the Bravo for the Job sent to him and told him of their Reconcilement but that he might keep the Money The other told him it was not in his Power to return it him but he was above receiving Money without doing his Work and therefore the Gentleman must of necessity suffer Death He intreated him and us'd many Arguments but all to no purpose When he found nothing would prevail he told him he would immediately acquaint the Gentleman with his Design which he did accordingly Notwithstanding the Bravo the same Evening found his Opportunity and left the other Gentleman for dead upon the  Mole  tho' he recover'd after a lingring Illness But the Bravo had the Impudence to go to the other when he found the Gentleman was in a fair way of Recovery and told him he begg'd his Pardon that he had not been as good as his Word but he would take Care and mend his Hand very quickly In short he was found so resolute in the Matter that the Gentleman was oblig'd to hire another of the same Trade to give  him a Cast of his Office and dispatch the Bravo before he could execute what was design'd and the next Day he was found dead at the very Door of the Gentleman's House he had intended to assassinate waiting as it was suppos'd for an Opportunity to do his Business  After we had view'd every thing within the City we went to see the much fam'd  Vesuvius  or the burning Mountain a League and a half East of the City The  Neapolitans  call it the Bedchamber of the Sun because he appears to them first from the Top of that Mountain Round the Bottom of it is the richest Spot of Ground in the Universe I'll not except even the Mines of  Potosi  for the yearly Vintage produces twelve hundred thousand Ducats The Middle of the Hill is very pleasantly shaded with Chesnut and several other Fruit Trees The Mountain has a double Top that to the North terminates in a Plain finely cultivated The other towards the South which is the  Volcano  rises much higher  When we had gain'd the Summit we descended gradually into its Bowels by large Steps cut on purpose It has in Times past done much Damage to the Country round it by its sudden Eruptions but now it forebodes nothing but Rain when the Top is envelop'd with Clouds  When we had sufficiently satisfy'd our Curiosities at  Naples  we took a Tour to  Putzol  or  Posuolo  through a Hollow of a Rock a Mile in Length and no other Light but what came in at both Ends and one in the Middle from the Top of the Rock This subterraneous Passage is pav'd with Stone all through and the narrowest Part of it is ten Yards over About the Middle is a small Chappel dedicated to the Virgin  Mary  We visited all the Rarities of the Place particularly  Virgil's  Tomb which is almost cover'd with Ivy They told me of a Laurel Tree that sprouted naturally out of it but not to take from that incomparable Man whose Works are everliving Laurels I could not see any such thing We also view'd the Lake  Agnano  so call'd from the multitude of Serpents or Snakes that fall into it from the pendent Mountains The Water is of two different Qualities that tasted upon the Surface is sweet or fresh but that taken deeper is of a brackish Taste suppos'd from some Minerals that inviron it  On the South Side of the Lake stands a natural Stove which is call'd St  German's Stove  but we had not Curiosity enough to enter it nor Faith enough to believe a ridiculous Fable that is told concerning it tho' it is reported a Saint declar'd it for a Truth which I shall put down here and leave my Reader to judge of it himself St  German  was advis'd to repair to this Stove to cure him of a dangerous Malady When he came there he found the Soul of a very pious Man that he knew tormented with the Heat of the Place St  German  as understanding the Language of Souls ask'd him how so good a Man as he was in his Lifetime came to be condemn'd to such a severe Punishment The Soul very civilly answer'd him that it was for siding with  Laurentius  who oppos'd  Symacus  in the Popedom but he was convinc'd that his Prayers would fetch him out of that Hothouse St  German  pray'd heartily you may be sure and got the Soul of the Man from out thence but where it went after no one could tell But the Place was call'd ever after St  German's Stove  To the East of the bordering Mountain is a Place they call the Cave of Death for whatever Thing of Life ventures to the farther End they say immediately drops down dead Tho' a Person that liv'd in a neighbouring Village ventur'd in often for a Reward When he came out again he was all of a Sweat and hardly able to stand for five or six Minutes When he had recover'd himself he took a Dog out of a Bag he had brought with him and by the means of a wooden Instrument made for that Purpose thrust him in to the very End and drew him out dead to all Appearance When he had remain'd some time for us to view him he took him up by the fore Legs and threw him into the Lake  Agnano  where he recover'd immediately swam out and ran away from us  Don Antonio  told me it was a hard matter to get a Dog there for assoon as ever they saw a Stranger they would run away into the Woods and sneak home again when they were gone which was the Reason the Person that went in always secures one for the Occasion  A Mile farther we went to the Court of  Vulcan  a Place unpleasant enough continually smoaking and such hot Vapours arise from the Pores of the Earth that it almost overcame me In some Places Water bubbles out of the Cavities and if we threw a Stone into it it rebounded back as if you had struck it against a Pavement But the Place is reckon'd to cure a great many Distempers especially to make Women pregnant and to cure Diseases of the Head and Eyes  Donna Isabella  was carry'd over it in a Sedan but I believe she did not want it upon the score of Barrenness as you may understand in her Story  We spent six Weeks in this not unpleasing Entertainment and  Don Antonio  being pretty well satiated as well as my self we went back again to  Rome  And now my Melancholy gain'd such Ground upon me that it was not in the Power of Dissimulation to hide it  Don Antonio  and all the Family express'd a great deal of Trouble for my Sorrow and I am well assur'd there was not any thing in their Power they would have refus'd to have given me Quiet But the Mind's Disease baffles the Physician's Art At last a Letter arriv'd from the Fryar which gave us no other Account but that he was safe return'd to  Genoa  and intended to embark for  Rome  in a few Days This lame Account quite dishearten'd me for now we had not the least Hope being we all agreed if he had succeeded he would have been forward enough to have acquainted us with it The Knowledge of this cast me quite down and my Body was forc'd to submit to the Troubles of my Mind A strong Fever seiz'd me and brought me to the Brink of the Grave And tho' I wish'd for Death yet like common Friends he fled from me in my Neeessity  Don Antonio  and his Lady seldom went from my Bedside and had I been a Brother to 'em they could not have regarded me more But Nature in spight of my Misfortunes prevail'd and I gather'd Strength even against my Will They had inform'd me in my Illness by my Importunity of the Fryar's Arrival and that he had not succeeded in his Negotiation But yet they had not told me all the Particulars I desir'd the Fryar might be sent for and conceal nothing from me of what had past Accordingly he came and gave me the following Relation  Sir said he in  French  assoon as I arriv'd at  Sallee  I met with  Hamet  the  Irish  Renegado He receiv'd me at first after a bruitish manner but when I declar'd I came to pay him his Demand for one of his Slaves that had made his Escape he began to be less sour in his Treatment He said a great many handsom things concerning  Don Antonio  but when I began to mention you he fell into a violent Rage and vented bitter Reproaches against you saying you were a vile Impostor had basely deceiv'd and robb'd him doubly of his Mistress and his Money I told him I came to ransom the Lady and pay for whatever Damages you had done As for the Lady said he she's Food for Fishes long ago for rather than she would submit to me she threw her self overboard before we had gain'd the Port when I had taken her out of a  Saick  one of my Slaves had brought her in from  Mammora  and in spight of our Endeavours to the contrary sunk for ever to the Bottom And is she gone said I O Proof of virtuous Love Happy had I been to have embrac'd the same Fate  The Relation of this killing Disaster took away my Senses for some time but when I had recover'd he went on I had some Hope at first that this was only a Fiction of his own but I found in the Town that it was no Secret and every body declar'd that it was Truth A Jew confirm'd me in't whom you had bought several Things of for your Voyage He told me that  Hamet  arriv'd without any Woman with him for he saw him land in a very ill Humour and had complain'd of him for assisting you to his Superiour at  Mequinez  and he receiv'd a sufficient Check from him I was too well convinc'd of the Truth and therefore  hasten'd my Departure and am very sorry I could not succeed but it was not in Fate and I hope you will calmly submit to the Will of Heaven who sends these Afflictions for Tryals  The good Friar gave me a great many wholsome Admonitions But I was not in a State much to observe 'em I now began to be careless of the World because there was nothing in't since the Death of my dear Wife worth my Notice I had no Thoughts of returning to  England  tho' I had Opportunities enough but took a Resolution of going to some remote Part of the World imagining the farther I was from my native Country I should be the further remov'd from my Anxiety But alas Sorrow is too constant a Companion and there's no parting with it but by Death  I begg'd Don  Antonio  if he heard of any Ship bound for a long Voyage he would acquaint me with it which he promis'd me to do after finding Persuasion had no Effect on me Two Months pass'd away and no news of a Ship when I began to be very uneasy and told  Antonio  I would e'en make a Voyage to  Genoa  where I could not well sail of a Vessel When he found nothing could stay me he ask'd me to what Part of the World I would chuse to go I told him I did not much care where Why then said he if you please my Father and I will fit you out a Ship of what Burden you think fit either for War or Traffick I thank'd him and told him I would have it for both if he pleas'd and I would be their  SupraCargo  if they thought fit to give me so great a Trust In short a Ship of two hundred and fifty Ton was bought of an  English  Merchant at  Naples  a stout new Vessel that mounted six and twenty Brass Guns and we mann'd her with a hundred Hands most  English  who understanding I intended for the South Sea were glad of the Opportunity Don  Antonio  took care to provide every thing necessary for Traffick and I was made Captain and  SupraCargo  I told him I hop'd I should in a few Years bring him a good Account of his Lading He obligingly answer'd me that he hop'd I would come Home reconcil'd to my self and he should think himself very happy The worst of it was we had no Commission neither would I suffer  Antonio  to procure me one For we resolv'd like  Englishmen  to fight only with the Enemies of our Country  I christen'd my Ship the  Isabella  out of Respect to  Antonio  's Lady and hoisted  English  Colours on Board When the Day came I was to go on Board there were Tears shed on both Sides I could not without some Regret part with so good a Friend as  Antonio  had prov'd to me and I am very well convinc'd that they were as sincere in their Sorrow  We set Sail from  Ostia  where our Ship lay ever since she came from  Naples  the second of  March  with Intention to steer our nearest Course for  America  Our Ship prov'd an excellent Sailor and we made the  Streights  Mouth in twelve Days from our first Departure When I beheld the Coast of  Africa  it brought fresh to my Memory past Transactions and I long'd for an Opportunity to be reveng'd on the  Moors  The next Day our Men discover'd two Sail bearing down the Wind upon us We thought our selves too well provided to run away tho' we kept on our Course and perceiving but one of 'em that follow'd us I ask'd my Men if they were willing to speak with that Vessel and they cry'd one and all they would with all their Hearts We prepar'd for an Engagement with  all the Expedition imaginable for fear she might prove of  Barbary  We hoisted our  English  Colours and they did the same When we found that we lay by that we might be inform'd of the News in  England  But assoon as ever they came along Side of us they pluck'd down their  English  Colours and hoisted those of  Morocco  in their Room calling to us to surrender that Instant or it should be worse for us We were a little surpriz'd at first in being disappointed but notwithstanding this my Men desir'd I would begin the Fight We had not open'd our Ports yet and I order'd my Men not to do it till I gave 'em the Word I sent a Man to busy himself about the Halliards of our Ancient that the  Rover  might imagine we were going to strike We were well provided with small Arms and all manner of warlike Stores I order'd every Man to their Posts but not to appear till they heard a Whistle upon which they should open their Ports and fire both great Guns and small Arms The  Rover  thought us long in striking our Colours he therefore call'd out to us again and told us if we did not strike that Instant they would pour a Broadside into us Just upon that I blew my Whistle my Men obey'd my Orders punctually they burst open our Ports thrust out their Guns and gave 'em a Broadside with a Discharge of their small Arms This put 'em in much Confusion as not expecting any Opposition and I am certain we kill'd a great many of their Men for imagining we should be their Prize without fighting they had crouded upon Deck all their Hands  I had tack'd about and given her another Salute before they return'd us the Favour But they were not long backward but pour'd in upon us very fast My Men did their Business  very well and the Fight continu'd half an Hour with the utmost Fury I began to fancy we should have but dry Meat as the Sailors say and looking upon their QuarterDeck I soon spy'd the Renegado  Hamet  giving Directions At the Sight of him I was both surpriz'd and pleas'd but my Soul was fill'd with an unusual Fury We were so near that I could hear every Word he said tho' I could not understand him because he spoke in the  Moorish  Tongue As we were tacking about and charging again I shew'd my self to him I told him he was the only Man in the World that I hated and that very Day he should be in my Power or I in his or Death should put an End to both our Lives He seem'd surpriz'd but gave me a great deal of abusive Language I encourag'd my Men and desir'd 'em to fight bravely for if we fell into their Hands we should have no Mercy I had fir'd my Piece at Random before that is at the first Person I saw but now I levell'd all at  Hamet  and he the same at me At last I had the good Fortune to fetch him down At this Sight I could not forbear giving a Shout of Joy which so affected those that were near me and understood the Business that they fought like so many Furies and after an obstinate Fight of two Hours they struck to us We gave God Thanks for our Victory and I immediately went on Board 'em where we had made a terrible Slaughter they having lost by their own Account ninety seven Men  I ask'd some of the Men what Ship that was which stood aloof from the Engagement and they inform'd me it was a Prize they had taken a few Days before laden with Wine and other Commodities I then thought of a Stratagem to get her into my Power I order'd our Ship to  strike her Colours and then we hoisted those of the  Moors  and took our Ship in Tow When the Prize saw us in that Posture she imagin'd the  Moor  had conquer'd and made all the Sail she could to come up with us so that we soon came near enough to send our LongBoat arm'd on Board her  There were but twelve  Moors  on Board besides Prisoners that were put under Hatches When our Men had taken care of 'em I went to 'em and order'd the Prisoners to be releas'd desiring the Person that was the Master to come upon Deck The  Moors  had not taken any of the Lading out of her She was a Ship of ninety Tons bound for  Leverpool  laden as I said before with PortWines and several Jars of Oyl I told the Master he was at Liberty to pursue his Voyage when he thought fit The poor Man was some time before he could believe what I said to be real But when he was convinc'd he return'd me the Thanks suitable to the Present I had made him Yet he would make me a Present of a couple of Hogsheads of Wine two Jars of Oyl and two of Raisons besides six of each to the Ship's Crew I had lost seventeen of my Men in the Engagement and eleven wounded which I supply'd by taking as many of the Slaves they had on board of  Hamet  's Ship all by their own Choice and the rest that did not care for so long a Voyage I recommended to the Master of the Prize who promis'd me to land 'em all in  England  We pillag'd the  Corsair  and found very good Booty We had out of her to the Value of two thousand Pounds in Goods which I enter'd in the Ship's Books for the Use of the Company We did not know well how to dispose of her Crew and tho' they deserv'd Death yet in cool  Blood I thought it was inhumane and I consider'd they never had injur'd me So I releas'd 'em by the Consent of the whole Company with this Agreement that they should make a Present from me to  Mirza  the Eunuch of fifty Pound in their  Moorish  Money which he that had Command over the rest swore by  Mahomet  to perform When we had taken every thing that was needful for our Voyage out of her we let her go and pursu'd our Course  We touch'd at the  Canaries  or Fortunate Islands to take in Fresh Water and turn'd the Lading we had taken out of the  Corsair  into Money And I shar'd it among the Sailors reserving a fourth Part for my self and Owners as I call'd 'em I gave the Men by Lotts leave to go ashore where they soon dispos'd of their Money for things they wanted but the chief of their Commerce was for Wine and Brandy knowing we had a long Voyage to make  We were obliged to leave the Place sooner than we design'd by reason our Pilot had unfortunately kill'd a  Portugueze  and the Governor threaten'd to have our Ship stopp'd if we did not surrender him up I understood that the Deceas'd had been in the Wrong and therefore rather than run the hazard of losing him we set Sail from thence the tenth of  April  The Castle fir'd several Guns with Shot to stay us but we did not regard it but kept on our Voyage  We met with nothing worth Notice till we made the Island of St  Vincent  one of the  Cape Verde  and came to an Anchor in ten Fathom Water in a fine gravelly Bottom  These Islands are the  Hesperides  of the Ancients The Natives are Blacks a poor miserable People They brought us a few Tortoise which we exchang'd any Trash for and they  were contented The Rivulet of fresh Water would hardly supply us it being almost dry'd up But we had Wood enough The whole Island is not above two Leagues and a half in Length and half a one in Breadth very barren of Fruit Grass or Roots and even Animals I saw only a few wild Asses and some Goats which were too nimble for us or so far off that they were not worth our wasting Powder and Shot  The Island of St  Anthony  about two Leagues to the North is a wellinhabited Island belonging to the Crown of  Portugal  We resolv'd to go and Anchor there but the Wind proving fair we pursu'd our Voyage pass'd by the Island  del Fogo  in the Night and we could perceive the  Volcano  burning like the Flame of a Glasshouse Twenty Days afterwards we pass'd the Aequinoctial Line with the usual Ceremony of ducking all those Persons that had never been there before But I bought off the best Part of the Delinquents for an Anchor of Brandy  The next Day we bury'd two of our Men who dy'd of the Wounds they had receiv'd in the Fight but all the rest happily recover'd We gave 'em three Guns and committed 'em to the Waves  In the Latitude of twenty two we saw a great Number of Fowls and therefore judg'd we could not be many Leagues from Land which we discover'd soon after to be  The Island of Ascension  about two Leagues to the North but we pass'd by it and in two Days more anchor'd in six Fathom Water at the Island of St  Catharines  about half a Mile from the main Land of  Brasil  This Island lies in twenty seven Degrees thirty Minutes of South Latitude It is almost a continu'd Grove of Trees and but thinly inhabited by  Portugueze  and a few Blacks They are in  want almost of all the Necessaries of Life besides Provision which is plentiful enough such as it is The Inhabitants are courteous enough and would not take Money for any thing we had of 'em but Linnen and Woollen And after I had got every thing that was necessary for the Ship I sold 'em Goods to the Value of four hundred Pounds which I receiv'd in pure Gold They never have Peace with the  Indians  of the Continent and being so very near they have often formerly made Inroads and carry'd off the Inhabitants But they have prevented such Attempts for the future by building several Redoubts where they keep constant Guard  They pay no other Taxes but the ChurchTythes which they'll be sure not to lose and for Religion they had but one Friar when I was there and all his Business was as I was inform'd only to receive his Tenths  A  Frenchman  told me a pleasant Story of one of the Inhabitants an industrious Fellow that had ten Children but notwithstanding his Industry found it a hard Matter to bring both Ends together at the Year's End Tho' the worst of his Grievances was the Priest's Tythes and his Money He often endeavour'd to persuade the Father to forget him a Year or two but all to no Purpose One Day the Father paid him a Visit in order to receive his Dues The poor Man told him ingenuously he had it not in his Power to give it him But he still insisted At last he told him he had but one Way to procure it and that he fear'd the Church would not allow of The Friar told him he was the best Judge of that if he would tell him what it was Why said the Man a Person that lives on the Continent has several fat Pigs of a very fine Breed Now said he I could bring one over with me unperceiv'd  of any one as I come from my daily Labour and such a one naming a Neighbour will give me a good Price for it The Friar paus'd some time but at last gave him this Answer It is certainly a Sin to steal but yet it is a greater Sin to rob the Church of its Due and therefore I will absolve you But bring the Pig to me for if it's worth so much to your Neighbour it is worth as much to me The Man told him he would be sure to bring it him that Night and the Friar said if he was not at Home he would leave Word with his Servant to take Care of it Now the Friar had no constant Dwelling here for they are sent from  Lagoa  a Town upon the Continent about ten Leagues to S S W and their Tythes were usually sent there in a small Bark kept for that Purpose The Priest took care to be out of the way that he might swear he knew nothing of the Matter if it was found out at the Time when the Man was to come with his Pig but gave his Servant a strict Order whatever was brought should be immediately carry'd on Board and taken a great deal of Care of  When the Time came the Man was as good as his Word and brought to the Priest's House his Promise in a Handbasket The Servant obey'd his Master's Orders and went to carry it on Board but before he could get to the Harbour what he had in his Basket began to cry out The poor Fellow was very much frighted to find he had got a Child in the Basket but fearing by the Charge his Master gave of it he was deeply concern'd in the Affair made all the haste he could on Board And the Vessel setting Sail that Night he went with his Charge to  Lagoa  where he very secretly delivered it to the Brotherhood  The Priest at St  Catharines  thought his Man had robb'd him and made his Escape being he was missing so long for he had carry'd a great many other things on Board before the Child The Imagination of this made the Father very uneasy and the Wind continuing fair he imbark'd on board a Vessel and arriv'd at  Lagoa  the Day after his Man But what was his Surprize when he found he had got a sucking Child instead of a sucking Pig He told the rest of his Brethren the Affront that had been put upon him and they resolv'd to send the Bantling back again but either for want of due Care or through the Fatigue of the Sea the Child dy'd When the Friar came back to St  Catharines  he ran openmouth'd to the poor Man and swore he should be excommunicated for playing Tricks with the Church The Man told him he was forward enough to have his Tythes so having ten Children and finding nine too many to keep he was resolv'd he should have his Due and have the Tenth And farther added if he offer'd to make any more Stir about it he would acquaint every body with his encouraging him to steal from his Neighbours  The Father finding the Man had too much Understanding to be Priestridden thought it his best way to hold his Tongue But the Secret was disclos'd and the poor Priest led a sad sort of Life For whenever he came for his Tythes many would merrily ask him if he would have his Tithe Pig In short the Friar was sham'd out of the Island and the Fraternity were obliged to send another Man in his Room who very often hears the Story of the Child tho' much against his Will  We anchor'd at first within a Bowshot of the  Island of Parrots  in seven Fathom Water But we were inform'd the best Place to water our Ship was two Leagues beyond the Island of St  Catharine  We had our present Wants supply'd from the Continent tho' not enough to water the Ship so we resolv'd to steer for the watering Place in the Bay of  Arazatiba  We steer'd between the Island and the Continent and all the way on each side we discover'd a beautiful Prospect of Houses inviron'd with natural Woods and Groves which gave the Eye a vast Delight When we approach'd the Bay of  Arazatiba  we perceiv'd a Ship with  English  Colours with her Anchor apeak in order to discover who we were I immediately hoisted  English  Colours but prepar'd for an Engagement as imagining her to be  French  or some  English  Pirate for there was War between the two Nations But I found it was a Privateer commanded by Captain  Dampier  who made me a Visit after having hail'd us When he was on Board he us'd many Persuasions to engage me to consort with him and follow the Business of Privateering but I told him I had other Affairs to manage After I had treated him handsomely with what the Ship afforded he took his Leave and invited me to dine on board his Vessel the next Day I gave him my Promise to wait on him and I accordingly went where I was very handsomely treated and there we agreed two Days after to make an Entertainment jointly for the Officers of both Ships on Shore and the Day after that for the rest of the Crew  In order to this I commanded a large Tent to be pitch'd capable of holding fifty Persons and we strove who should send the most Materials on shore for our Feast We had the  Musick of both Vessels but mine proving to be the best as being  Italians  gave the most Delight not but they join'd in Consort and agreed very well  After Dinner Captain  Dampier  told me tho' he could not oblige me with  Italian  Musick yet he had an  English  Eunuch that sang admirably he added he could not answer for his Judgment but he was very well convinc'd he never heard a finer Voice in his Life The Person was brought in but my Readers may guess at my Surprize when in the Person of the Singer I discover'd my Mistress's Lawyer whom my Master and his Friend had equipt for a fine Singer I knew him assoon as ever I saw him but I perceiv'd by his Behaviour he had no Knowledge of me neither was it very possible he could have known me because he had never seen me but once and then he had too much Concern to make any Observations But the Occasion had imprinted in my Mind a lively Idea of him  He sung admirably well and with good Judgment I ask'd the Captain how he came to be an Eunuch he told me he could not inform me neither could he ever prevail upon him to let him know it We were very merry for several Hours and I may safely declare that during that Time I had bury'd my inward Malady  I told the Singer I believ'd I could let Captain  Dampier  into the Secret of his Castration if he would not be offended at it He seem'd very much concern'd and blush'd but imagining I knew nothing of the Matter he gave me his Consent to say what I thought fit yet with the utmost Chagrine in his Face as believing he was only going to be the Jest of the Company  But when I began to name my Master and enter'd into some Part of the Story I found him in the utmost Confusion insomuch that I pity'd him and told him I would not proceed any farther without his Consent He told me in bad  French  for he had observ'd that the Captain and I sometimes talk'd to one another in that Language that I was very welcome to tell his unfortunate Story but not to so many Auditors for added he I perceive you know it very well I gave him my Word only to tell the Captain for which he thank'd me but I told him in return that he must let me into the rest of his Story which he promis'd to do The Captain and I with my quondam Lawyer took an Opportunity of leaving the Company and walking a little way up the River Side where I inform'd him that I came to the Knowledge of his Story by the Porter that dogg'd him for I did not think it convenient to let him know that I was a Person concern'd and that seeing him go into the Coach in  Lombardstreet  I remember'd his Face again He gave us his Story in the following manner  I was bred up to the Law by my Father an Attorney of  LincolnsInn  who dying left me a small Estate which I soon spent in none of the best Company I had no Thoughts of Business 'till drove to it through the utmost Necessity But finding Want approaching began to open my Eyes I took Chambers in  CliffordsInn  and resolv'd to stick to Business I soon found Clients enow through the Credit of my Father and understanding the rough as well as the smooth Part of the Law I got Mony enough to supply even any Extravagance I had ever been a very great Admirer of the Female Sex and had the good Fortune  or rather the Ill to succeed in most of my Amours  The first time I ever saw the fatal Cause of my Misfortune was at St  Dunstan  's Church which to my Shame I must own I too often frequented without Devotion Our Eyes often told us the Language of the Heart I got the Opportunity of sitting in the next Pew to her but had never once disclos'd my Passion  One  Sunday  as the Clerk had set the Psalm she begg'd I would lend her my Book saying she had left hers at Home When she had done she return'd it me and thank'd me I had resolv'd with my self to have waited on her out of the Church but was prevented by the Person that was afterwards her Husband When I came home I pull'd my PrayerBook out of my Pocket but perceiv'd it would not shut as usual which put me on examining it I found a Note pinn'd to the last Leaf which I had not observ'd before The Contents were to invite me to an Assignation that Evening at Six  I was very punctual and found her there before me I begg'd her Pardon for making her wait which she easily granted with a gentle Reproach and we soon came to a right Understanding for that very Night before we parted I had what I wish'd the Sweet which was follow'd by the worst of Bitters  She told me she had long had a Passion for me which tho' she resisted all she could got the better of her Modesty and forc'd her to declare it She inform'd me too that she was speedily to be married to the Man that led her out of Church tho' it was much against her Inclination but she was oblig'd to comply with her Mother's Commands  We had many Meetings sometimes at my Chambers till I was taken too much Notice of by some of my Neighbours And when she was married we often met at different Places and she as often made me handsome Presents He then related how he was discover'd at my Master's House by one of the Prentices meaning me but as he conceal'd his Face by turning it to the Window he could not remember him He also related all that I have declar'd in the former Sheets and added that when the Operation was over his Mistress as knowing him of no farther Use to her left him without speaking a Word When I had recover'd Strength said he to write I sent for some of my intimate Friends and among the rest a Surgeon I told him my Misfortune and was examin'd by him but I was obliged to stay at the Inn several Days At last tho' almost a Miracle I was perfectly cur'd and return'd to my Business but my Story getting Air I was made the Scoff of every Body that saw me till in short my Life became a Burthen to me and I took a Resolution to go to some Part of the World where no one should know me and getting acquainted with Captain  Dampier  he favour'd me so far as to enter me Steward I had learnt to sing when I was young and my Voice growing clear by my Loss is much improv'd I had kept my Misfortune a Secret to all the Crew if I had not receiv'd a Wound in my Thigh by an  Indian  Arrow on the Coast of  Florida  a Year ago for the Surgeon coming to dress me when the extream Anguish had taken away my Senses perceiv'd my Condition and disclos'd it to the Company But I have the good Fortune not to be flouted at  When the Story was finish'd we join'd our Company again and ended the Day in Mirth and Jollity The next Day my Crew went on Shore to regale themselves for Captain  Dampier  and I had alter'd our Resolution of sending both Companies together for fear of Quarrels and Disorder And his Crew went on Shore the following Day  About Noon as I was reading in my Cabin I heard the Report of several Pieces upon which I ran out and went my self to the Topmast Head where I perceiv'd my Men who were filling our Casks at the River of  Parrots  surrounded by a multitude of  Indians  I upon the Instant let slip our Cables and having a strong Sea Breeze steer'd full into the River's Mouth at all hazards ordering every Man to his Arms and to load all our great Guns with Musket Ball By good Fortune the Tide was almost at the highest so that we came on broadside the Rivulet where our Men were defending themselves They had made a Rampart with the empty Casks and had kept off the  Indians  with their Pieces but just as we came they had spent all their Ammunition and had resolv'd to submit to the  Indians  But assoon as they perceiv'd us they took to their Heels and ran towards our Ship and the  Indians  after them but we soon stopp'd their Career by firing our double and round which kill'd 'em above fifty Men and put the rest to Flight We took our Men on Board and intended to fall out of the River but found the Tide turn'd and before we could get out our Ship ran aground so that we were oblig'd to wait till the next Tide I was very uneasie at this Accident and order'd my Lieutenant to take the Boat and acquaint Captain  Dampier  with it  In the mean time not to be idle I arm'd twenty Men and order'd them to guard the rest while they fill'd our Casks which was accordingly done and with the LongBoat brought on Board I would not let them be hoisted into the Ship for fear of hurting her now she lay aground tho' it prov'd to be a clayie Bottom  An Hour before Night we perceived an  Indian  running very swiftly to us who call'd to us in  Portugueze  to fetch him aboard Assoon as he was in the Ship he told a Man that understood  Portugueze  that the  Indians  to the Number of a Thousand design'd in the middle of the Night to attack our Ship and that they would come down in Canoes for they very well knew we could not get out till Tide of Flood  This Man whom we took for an  Indian  was a  Portugueze  the  Indians  had taken Prisoner a Year before and understanding their Language learnt their Resolution and while they were calling their Number together he took his Opportunity to make his Escape I order'd him to be told he should be rewarded for his Intelligence I immediately call'd all the Officers together to consult about the Danger and we agreed to send to Captain  Dampier  for Help who came with fifty Men well arm'd And by his Advice assoon as it was dark we landed six of our Cannon and rais'd a small Battery without any Noise or Bustle these were pointed up the River slaunting Two of our Guns were loaded with double and round in the Stern of our Ship The rest of our Men were order'd in close Coverts on each Side the River with Directions to let the  Indian  Canoes pass 'em and not to fire till they were all gone by  Every thing was concerted and settled and every man order'd to his Post to expect the  Charge and we had contriv'd it so well that none of our Fires could hurt one another  About one aclock in the Morning we could hear their Paddles in the Water and soon after perceive 'em silently falling down the River to the Number of two hundred Canoes We let them come within fifty Yards of our Ship before we fir'd but when we began we made such a terrible Slaughter of 'em that I pity'd 'em We took one Canoe with twelve  Indians  and their Chief among them When the Morning dawn'd we were amaz'd to see what Havock Death had made the very Shores were stain'd with Blood and we had not lost one Man of either of our Crews The  Portugueze  who gave us Notice I rewarded with a hundred Pound and two new Suits of Cloaths both Linnen and Woollen and we made Use of him for our Interpreter He told us we had one of their  Caciques  among the Prisoners and a Man of great Power among the  Indians  I order'd him to ask him the Reason of his Enmity to us since we had never offended them He told him that he took us for  Spaniards  or  Portugueze  Nations they hated from the barbarous Usage they had met with from them But he was sorry he had molested us being he was convinc'd we were  Englishmen  and Enemies to the  Spaniards  as well as themselves But however he would pay sufficiently for his Ransom if we would spare his Life and accordingly we agreed for a hundred Weight of Gold Dust and twenty in Ingots and he order'd one of his Retinue to fetch it In the mean time we took the Advantage of the Tide and fell down to our old Station  The next Day at Noon two Canoes arriv'd one with the Gold and several Persons of Quality  that came to wait on their King and the other laden with Fruits and Provisions which I had equally parted between both Ships Companies I took the Ingots for my Sharers and the Dust was divided among us according to our Allowance Captain  Dampier  and his Crew were mightily pleas'd with their Dividend and once more press'd me to accompany them but I gave 'em a flat Denial for the present with this Hope that when I had visited several Places in the SouthSea I would return to St  Salvador  and wait two Months for them there  We put the  Indians  on Shore and the next Day weigh'd Anchor again saluting Captain  Dampier  with Guns who return'd the like Number and we steer'd our Course with a fresh Gale for the Streights of  Magellan  I intending to pass thro' those Streights into the  SouthSea  for I was of Opinion it would shorten our Voyage and then my Curiosity strengthen'd that Opinion But I was advis'd by my Lieutenant to venture up to  Buenos Ayres  a Town belonging to the  Spaniards  where he assur'd me we might drive a very good Trade underhand with the Merchants I communicated the Matter to the whole Company who unanimously agreed it was the best Course we could steer So we kept in with the Shore and steer'd for the  Rio de la Plata  or the  River of Plate  which we reach'd in twenty Days without any Accident As we had War with  France  and  Spain  I had hoisted  French  Colours that we might have the Liberty to trade with more Safety  Buenos Ayres  is situated above fifty Leagues up the  River of Plate  which above the Town receives the Name of  Paraguay  and takes its Rise many Leagues up the Country which is possess'd by a numerous Nation of  Indians  who  sometimes trade with the  Spaniards  but oftner murder 'em when they can meet 'em conveniently for the Spirit of Revenge is suck'd in with their Milk and handed down from Father to Son so that they imagine it to be a very meritorious Deed to dispatch one of them and they are generally rewarded by their  Cacique  for it  The Town of  Buenos Ayres  takes its Name from the excellent Temperature of the Climate and its pleasant Situation They have Commerce with the Ships of  Europe  not above once a Year which bring 'em the Necessaries they want and in Return ease 'em of their Gold that being a Metal less esteem'd than Iron which proves more useful to them When we were within two Leagues of the Port we came to an Anchor in a little Creek in eight Fathom Water a sandy Bottom We did not care to go nearer the Town for fear the Governour should have taken it in his Head to have hinder'd our going out again  Though we were not in Sight of it yet we had Canoes on board of us in an hour after our anchoring and some of Note came  incognito  to be inform'd what we dealt in One of them told me he believ'd it would be no difficult thing to dispose of my Cargo if I thought fit to make the Governour a small Present Accordingly I took his Advice and sent my Steward in my Name with a Piece of Holland and half a dozen Pieces of  Italian  Silks which he receiv'd as a very valuable Present and sent me Word he would not in the least molest me provided I did not deal too barefac'd I understood him and therefore was very cautious selling but to one at a time nor would I suffer another to enter my Ship till the former was dispatch'd  In two Days I got rid of all the Cargo that I intended to part with to a very great Advantage and then I allow'd my Men Liberty to do what they thought fit with what they had which gave them a general Satisfaction The next Day I invited the Governour on Board with some of the principal Merchants and entertain'd them in my Cabin and in return I was to dine on Shore at the Castle But I left a strict Order with my Lieutenant how to behave himself if I should be stopp'd for I knew the  Spaniards  to be unfaithful People  When we landed I observed the Town made but a mean Appearance consisting only of two Streets built in the Form of a Cross and surrounded with a Mud Wall The Castle it self made but an indifferent Figure but however I was very elegantly entertain'd The Governor seem'd to have less of the Formality of the  Spaniard  than ever I met with in any of them When I took my Leave of him he made me a Present of two  Indian  Slaves and a Bar of Gold that weigh'd three Pound two Ounces When I came on Board I call'd a Council to know what Course we should steer next for as to Traffick I had no Pretence to go to the  SouthSea  being all my Cargo was already dispos'd of We debated for some time and at last we all agreed to go for the  SouthSea  upon the score of Privateering We communicated our Intentions to the Company and they all seem'd very much rejoic'd at the Resolution I had taken  Now I began to repent I had not join'd with Captain  Dampier  for I wanted Men for any notable Exploit but I did not despair of meeting with him in the  SouthSea  We weigh'd Anchor and steer'd for the Streights of  Magellan  with a fair Wind One Morning my Servant wak'd me and told me that a Sail bore down upon us and the Lieutenant desir'd to know how to behave himself I rose upon the Instant and by the help of my Perspective saw it was a Vessel with  English  Colours but I imagining they were put up only for a Shew I caus'd  French  Colours to be hoisted which soon was answer'd by the same in the Ship that pursu'd us I order'd every thing to be prepar'd for an Engagement without any Hurry commanded my Men not to appear upon Deck and kept on my Course with crouded Sail that our Pursuers might imagine I was willing to get from them yet I order'd it so by false Steering that they gain'd upon us About Three in the Afternoon they were within half a League of us firing every Quarter of an Hour a Gun to Leeward to let us know we were to take them for Friends  I order'd our Men to tack about hoist up  English  Colours and bear upon 'em We soon perceiv'd we had much surpris'd 'em but notwithstanding they kept up their  French  Colours and seem'd to prepare for the Engagement tho' they were much inferior to us When we came along Side I hal'd 'em and after owning they were  French  commanded them to surrender but was answer'd with a Broadside which we return'd so fast that they soon struck and call'd for Quarter I order'd the Captain to come on Board who inform'd me that his Vessel was call'd the  Felicity  belonging to Monsieur  de Gennes  and had been separated from the Fleet three Days before I us'd the Captain very handsomly for the Sake of Monsieur  St Olon  the  French  Ambassador I gave him a Letter and a small Present for that Gentleman  and dismiss'd him without taking any thing from them I found this Action did not please some of my Men and not caring to have them uneasie I summon'd them upon the Deck and told 'em the Obligations I had to the  French  Ambassador acquainting them as this was a Ship of War there was not much to be expected from 'em therefore I told 'em I would share five hundred Pound among 'em to make 'em Amends for their Disappointment But not one of them would accept a Penny and in return I told them I did not intend to make any more such Compliments to the  French  if ever they came into my Power again They were very well pleas'd with my Declaration and some of them prais'd my Generosity for tho' most Sailors are rough and blunt in Speech yet they can in their way admire a generous Action as well as other Men  Our Officers were under some Apprehensions of meeting with the Squadron of Monsieur  de Gennes  which being a Fleet of five Sail would certainly be too hard for us and we were inform'd by the Captain of the  Felicity  that they were sail'd for the Streights of  Magellan  I found their Fears very reasonable and it would be a foolhardy Action to encounter a Force so much superior For though Life was burthensome enough to me yet Humanity oblig'd me not to hazard the Lives of so many Men that were not out of Love with this World So I resolv'd to wave my Curiosity and make for  Le Maire  's Streights which in five Days time we discover'd known to Sailors by three Rocks call'd the  Three Brothers  from their Likeness to one another  We found a strong Current setting Northward and an unusual Tossing of the Ship  but we got through the Streights in two Days with Safety and made for the  SouthSea  The next Day we discover'd the  Magellan Clouds  so well known to Sailors which convinc'd us that we were overagainst those Streights that run into the  SouthSea  These Clouds are always seen in the same Degree and the same orbicular Form We kept on our Course not intending to come within Sight of the Continent for fear of a Discovery and the Weather favour'd us it continuing very hazy  About an Hour within Night we heard the Sound of a Trumpet which we conjectur'd must be on oard of some Vessel because we were well assur'd we were not near enough the Land upon which I immediately gave Orders to put out all our Lights and steer our Course that Way we heard the Sound which Sounding often gave us true Notice of their Course and in half an Hour tho' pretty dark we gain'd Sight of 'em But their Mirth was soon chang'd when we got up with 'em thrust out our Guns and hail'd 'em We understood they were  Spanish  and I order'd 'em to be told if they did not upon the Instant lye by and send their Commander on Board I would immediately fire upon 'em They very readily comply'd with my Orders hoisted out their Boat and the Captain came on Board me whose Name was  Don Juan Villegro  and his Ship the  Wildfire  He was employ'd by the Viceroy of  Peru  to carry condemn'd Persons to  Baldivia  which is the Residence of most of the Rogues of  America  But we were also inform'd they had the  Real Situado  on Board which is a Sum of Money so call'd that is sent from the Viceroy of  Peru  to pay and cloath the Garrison as  well as to repair the Fortifications of  Baldivia  This Sum usually amounted to four hundred thousand Crowns but we could find no more than two hundred and fifty thousand but then to make Amends for the Deficiency we met with a great many valuable  EastIndia  Goods brought from thence by their  Manilla  Ship for the Merchants always put their Supply for  Baldivia  in the Ship that carries the Money to pay the Garrison that being the only Time to dispose of their Goods  This Prize made my Men mad with Joy and I fear'd it would make 'em think they should have enough and consequently desire to return home But I soon found it had the contrary Effect and they all expected from this Earnest of good Fortune Riches enough in the Voyage we propos'd to make 'em for ever  I treated the Prisoners handsomely which were fortysix including fifteen Felons who were well pleas'd to have chang'd their Masters expecting better Usage from us than from the  Spaniards  of  Baldivia  where they were design'd There was one  Roberts  an  Englishman  among them who I have been inform'd has been executed since for Piracy him two  Frenchmen  four  Spaniards  and the Trumpeter I enter'd in my Books to reinforce my Crew understanding their Crime was only Suspicion of Piracy therefore I was convinc'd they were good Sailors But I did not know how to dispose of the Ship and the rest of the Crew If I should give 'em their Liberty they would of course alarm the Country and if I kept them with me Provisions would fall short for they were victual'd but for a Month's Voyage  The  Spanish  Captain being inform'd of my Fears told me by an Interpreter that he had  receiv'd such handsome Usage from me that he would upon his Honour steer to what Port I thought fit and report if I pleas'd that I was sail'd back again for the North Sea I told him though I could rely upon his Honour he could not answer for all the rest At last I thought of a Stratagem to deceive the  Spanish  Captain as well as the other Prisoners as follows In the first Watch of the Night the Prisoners being all under Hatches I came to our Sailors upon Deck and told 'em the ill Consequence of keeping or letting go the Prisoners and therefore concerted with 'em that they should pretend a Mutiny the next Day and all declare for going back through the Streights into the North Sea When the first Watch was reliev'd I acquainted the other Moiety of the Company and then retir'd to Rest But my Slumbers were broken with Visions of my dear Mrs  Villars  I dreamt I saw her in the Arms of the Renegado  Hamet  struggling and calling out on me for Help and before I could come to her Assistance Death had freed her from the barbarous Wretch This Dream had brought to my Mind all my Afflictions and I can't tell how long I should have continu'd feeding upon my Sighs if I had not been alarm'd with Shouts and Noises upon Deck I ran out to see what was the Matter and found my Men as was design'd in their feign'd Mutiny I had forgot at first and was much alarm'd but recollecting I carry'd on the Cheat And Grief had so seated herself on my Countenance with Thoughts of my Dream that one of the QuarterMasters told me afterwards my Looks were enough to deceive all the World  The  Spaniards  had leave to be upon Deck all the Day and Care was taken to let them into the Secret At Dinner I told the  Spanish  Captain for he and the Merchants always eat with me that I thought his Speeches yesterday were prophetic for I was compell'd to comply with my obstinate Crew and sail for the North Sea again He reply'd he wish'd me happy whereever I went And to carry on the Deceit we steer'd our Course back again  In the Afternoon  Roberts  came to me and told me that one of the  Spaniards  who was willing to stay with us would undertake to bring me ten thousand Pieces of Eight in ten Days if I would let him have the Prize Upon what  Roberts  said I sent for the Man and had him examin'd by  Roberts  who understood  Spanish  very well The  Spaniard  told me he would not have me enquire into the Matter till it was done and for the better Security I might send who I thought sit with him provided he had one of his Companions that was to help in the Design Accordingly I order'd twenty Hands and to obey the  Spaniard  in this Expedition as if he were their Captain  We agreed to wait for them the limited Time in the same Degree we parted from 'em I inform'd the  Spanish  Captain by an Interpreter that his Countryman was gone upon some secret Expedition and assoon as he return'd we would pursue our Course He answer'd whatever he had undertaken he was of the Opinion he would succeed in it for he had certainly as much Cunning as any Person in the World he had been condemn'd to  Baldivia  once before and had made his Escape from thence and he did not doubt but he would get from them again if he had been carry'd there the  second time and farther gave me some Hints that he might deceive me in this Undertaking  I began to be in some fear of having a Knavish Trick play'd me and would have recall'd the Vessel if it had not been too late but hoping for the best I resolv'd to cruise till the Time appointed was expir'd  I had cloath'd my two  Indians  that were presented me by the Governour of  Buenos Ayres  in  European  Habits very handsome and instructed them in the  English  Tongue They very readily learnt and I gave them all the tender Usage imaginable which they were obligingly sensible of and I believe they would have sacrific'd their Lives to have serv'd me I found them very handy and docible and very goodnatur'd which convinces me if mild Methods were us'd with them they might be very easily wrought to be Friends to the  Europeans  especially the  English  And I think 'tis great Pity such a vast Body of People should be ignorant of the Divine Being that form'd the Universe Though the  Spaniards  it's true send  Missionaries  among them to inculcate Christianity yet they generally neglect their holy Functions and strive all they can to inrich themselves by laying exorbitant Taxes upon the poor  Indians  And I have been inform'd that in some Parts of  America  all the Wealth they get is deliver'd to the  Mission  reserving to themselves only what is needful and that but from Day to Day I had my two  Indians  made Christians one by by the Name of  Robert  and the other  Joseph  being mine and my Father's Names And I hope in the Sight of God LayBaptism will suffice especially when we had not the Happiness of the other Form And it is not  impossible if they lead good Lives they may find the Road to Heaven as well as if they had been christen'd in a Church by an orthodox Clergyman  Three Days before the Time I expected my  Spaniard  back we discovered two Sail making up to us which made us prepare for an Engagement but we soon perceiv'd it was our Prize with another Vessel The  Spaniard  came on Board and inform'd me that he had been something better than his Word for he believ'd that in Money and in Goods he had brought to the Value of Dollars He gave us the following Account by  Roberts  Last time I was Prisoner at  Baldivia  I was compell'd to work for one  Don Sancho Ramirez  a sordid covetous jealous malicious Wretch one that us'd to deal in Merchandize It was his usual Method to wait at a Country House near the Sea for the Arrival of the  Real Situado  Ship which was the same I had taken and then go privately on Board to deal with the Merchants The Knowledge of this made me undertake this Expedition as well to get Money as to be reveng'd on the old Villain for the Stripes he has often given me without any Provocation When we arriv'd within half a League of the Place we perceiv'd a Bark riding at Anchor I began to demur as fearing we might be discover'd but at last resolv'd to proceed let what would happen The Bark weigh'd and made towards us which occasion'd another Surprize but my Fears were soon over when I perceiv'd  Don Sancho  upon Deck He hail'd us and desir'd we would slacken Sail that he might come on Board Accordingly we ran into a small Creek and came to an Anchor I did not appear at first but let the other  Spaniard  that went with us personate the Captain and instructed him accordingly Assoon as he came on Board he enquir'd for  Don Juan Villegro  for that Gentleman us'd to command the  Real Situado  and was answer'd that he was very ill and could not sail this Voyage Then he enquir'd for the Merchants telling him that the Governor had discover'd his usual Practice of Dealing first with them therefore he had contriv'd to meet us in one of his own Vessels that was ready laden for  Buenos Ayres  and only staid for our Arrival to set Sail I was glad to hear of that because I intended to make Prize of it The  Spaniard  invited him into the Cabin while I went on board his Bark with ten Men arm'd and secur'd it there being but five Men and a Boy in it The rest of the Crew were on Shore  I cut her Cable and our own and made out to Sea again When we were under Sail I came on Board and shew'd my self to the old  Don  and in a few Words made him understand his Condition I thought at first we should have been obliged to have bury'd him for he look'd for a great while like one that was dead But I recover'd him a little by shewing him the Box that contain'd his Heart and Soul I mean his Money He did his Endeavour to fly at me to be reveng'd on me but he was held but to give him a little more Comfort I read over to him his Bill of Lading and told him plainly I would not deal with him if his Goods did not answer his Bill When he found he could do no good by Passion he told me he would give me half his Money if I would restore him his Ship and Cargo I was very well as I was I told him and since I had got it all in my Possession I would have no more Dealings with him only  the odd ten thousand Pieces of Eight more for his Ransom He was so thunderstruck at this that he did not so much as offer to open his Mouth to speak but kept so long silent that I fancying he would never speak again took him upon Deck that he might behold the lovely Prospect of the Water for by this time we were out of Sight of Land His Heart then began to melt and he fell down upon his Knees and begg'd he might have his Liberty notwithstanding we had robb'd him I was in a very great Passion and order'd him to mollify the Word and call it Overreaching which with much Chastisement he did But I told him he was obliged to make your Honour one Visit and accordingly I have brought him to wait on you  I must confess I could not help admiring the  Spaniard  's Ingenuity and yet I did not greatly relish the Action for tho' it was lawful Prize to us yet I thought it was downright Robbery in him However I gave him the Thanks our Interest requir'd and further told him by  Roberts  our Interpreter that he should be very well rewarded for his Undertaking  The old  Spaniard  was brought on Board us more dead than alive and understanding we were  English  he spoke to me in that Language and begg'd he might be set at Liberty I told him he need not apprehend any thing for he should have his Liberty and civil Usage He thank'd me as well as his Grief would give him leave and I invited him to dine with me which he did accordingly the same Day  I order'd the Cargo out of the Bark which was very considerable and most of the Provision because I fear'd it would be what we should want The other Vessel as belonging to the King of  Spain  and one who could pretty well  bear that Loss I intended to keep for our selves The Bark I restor'd to  Don Ramirez  with several Bales of Goods that would prove of small Use to us tho' of Value to him nay I would very willingly have given him all his Goods and Money too if it had not been for wronging my Crew for as I said I look'd upon it as gain'd by Fraud However I ventur'd to give him back twenty thousand Ryals which did not amount to mine and my Owners Share He return'd me his Acknowledgments by giving me a very handsome Ring that they had not taken from him and told me he ever thought the  English  generous Enemies  I caus'd all the Prisoners to be put on Board the Bark and took my leave of 'em They return'd me abundance of Thanks for my kind Usage and vow'd if ever Fortune should send any of our Countrymen among 'em they should fare the better for my Sake I must own I was not displeas'd with their Acknowledgments A Man feels a secret Pleasure within himself when he has done a humane Action when on the contrary if a Person has been guilty of Baseness Horror and Remorse gnaw his Inwards  The Day after I had parted with the Prisoners I summon'd all my Men upon Deck and told 'em what the  Spaniard  had done for 'em and advis'd with 'em what Recompence I should make him We soon agreed he should have five thousand Pieces of Eight his Companion five hundred and the rest of 'em enter'd to a Share of the Booty we had before taken Accordingly I sent for 'em and told 'em what I intended The  Spaniard  return'd me suitable Thanks in  French  for he had been inform'd I understood that Language I found in his Discourse  a ready turn of Wit and Humour and of a Person that had read Mankind He did not seem to be above thirty Years of Age of a free and open Nature having nothing of the stiff Formality of the  Spaniard  tho' born at  Sevil  in  Old Spain  I told him I expected a short Account of his Life he readily answer'd he should be proud to comply with my Desires but he begg'd I would defer it for some Time till he might be a little more us'd to my Conversation for said he smiling mine has been a very merry and odd sort of a Life and therefore till I have more Freedom I shall desist because I shall lose the Spirit in telling it  We steer'd our Course towards  Panama  depending that our Prisoners would spread the Report of our going back again for the North Sea In thirty six Degrees and forty five Minutes we discover'd a Vessel steering the same Course I order'd the Prize to chase her and before Night she took her It was a Bark laden with Tallow and Hides bound for  La Conception  I repented the taking of her for we soon found she was but a heavy Sailor and therefore could not keep Company with us and it was not proper for us to let 'em depart  Don Pedro Aquillio  which was the Name of of our Intelligent  Spaniard  told me he would undertake to dispose of the Cargo and Bark to a good Advantage if I could tell how to dispose of the Men which were but four that is three  Indians  and a  Spaniard  The  Indians  were very well pleas'd to be receiv'd as Servants on Board yet we allow'd 'em a half Share in our future Purchases The  Spaniard  we intended to detain on Board till we had made our cruising Voyage and then release him So depending on  Don Pedro  's Ingenuity I let him go off with  the Bark with three  Spaniards  to assist him having his Promise to return the next Day We were then within five Leagues of  La Conception  and therefore resolv'd to remain in that Station till his Arrival keeping  Mamelles de Biobio  or the Dugs of  Biobio  two Rocks so call'd in View  The next Day we perceiv'd him coming with a Pirogue a small  Spanish  Boat with one Sail He brought me a handsome Present of Fruit and enough besides for the whole Crew Well said he I have made but an indifferent Bargain I have brought you but twenty thousand Pieces of Eight The old Rogue of a Governor would not give any more He told me that the Governor of  La Conception  ingrossed all the Tallow and Hides and forc'd the Retailers to give him his own Price so he went boldly to him and sold him Bark and Cargo  Don Pedro  advis'd us to cruise for the  Manilla  Ship which was daily expected His Advice was approv'd on all Hands therefore Orders were given to Wood and Water the Ships for the Voyage and accordingly we made for  Juan Fernando  and arriv'd there the fifth of  September  It being a remarkable Day with me it lives in my Memory for the loss of my Journal by an odd Accident hinders my keeping a regular Account We spent but two Days in wooding and watering and killing Goats which are there in great Plenty  There are three Islands that bear the Name of  Juan Fernando  the first Discoverer tho' there are no other Inhabitants on them than Goats There's a noble Bay on the North Side of the Island capable of containing five hundred Sail where you anchor at sixteen Fathom Water a sandy Bottom We left it with a favourable Wind for our Design and made farther up the  Coast  January  the first and it was fear'd we had miss'd our Booty for the  Manilla  Ship generally arrives at  Acapulco  about  Christmas  however we resolv'd to coast about for twenty Days longer and if we fail'd of her to return into the North Sea with a Design to cruize down the Coast  We kept out of Sight of Land for fear of being discover'd  On the sixth we perceiv'd two Sail and accordingly gave 'em Chace  Don Philip  assur'd me it was the  Manilla  Ship and a GuardShip along with her We call'd a Council immediately where it was resolv'd the Bark should attack the  Manilla  Ship while ours was to engage the Man of War And this was the Reason  Don Pedro  gave for it that the  Manilla  Ship was so very unweildy the Bark could play round her and being so small she was out of the reach of their Cannon for they could make no Use but of those upon their upper Deck The Man of War seeing we gave 'em Chace slacken'd her Sail to stay for us imagining we should both attack him but he found himself mistaken Our  Pink  past him without firing a Gun but assoon as ever we came along Side we gave him a Broadside with a loud Huzza He soon return'd it but we ply'd him so close that he began to make off but we follow'd him close at the Heels and coming under his Starboard Quarter gave him another Broadside which brought his MainMast by the Board upon which he immediately struck  The Sea being very smooth tho' a handsome Breeze of Wind we mann'd our Longboat and I went on Board with forty Hands well arm'd When I came upon Deck I order'd the  Spaniards  to be taken on Board and  secur'd under Hatches but I was much surpriz'd to find but sixteen Men in the Ship besides eight that were kill'd and not one that appear'd like an Officer among 'em But we were soon inform'd the Captain had order'd one hundred and fifty of his Men on Board the  Manilla  Ship assoon as they had discover'd us in the Morning because her Crew were most of 'em sickly  We imagin'd our small Vessel must have warm work on't being not above thirty five Hands in all So we resolv'd immediately to cut off the Rudder of the Man of War and leave her for having lost her MainMast she could not follow us to do us any Damage and six of her Men we took on Board us who finding we were  English  seem'd very willing to serve us and I promis'd 'em their Share in the Booty if we succeeded These six Men were old  Christians  as they call themselves and they value themselves very much upon it despising the  Creolians  We made all the Sail we could after the  Manilla  Ship and soon overtook her for our small Vessel had kept her very well in Play tho' she had warm Work on't and her Rigging was very much shatter'd tho' they had not lost a single Man but she was obliged to fall astern to mend her Tackle I order'd 'em to send me twenty Men on Board which I was oblig'd to lye by for▪ I had brought all my Guns to bear on one Side and did not fire one till I came under her Stern and then I pour'd 'em into her and tack'd about to charge again I observ'd a Boat busy about her Stern but could not imagine what they were doing However I resolv'd they that were in it should find a difficult Matter to get on Board again But I was much surpriz'd to find it my own Boat with  Don Pedro  in it who  had taken the occasion in the Smoak of our first Broadside to nail up the Rudder so that the Ship could not tack about He made what haste he could on Board the Bark which had now mended all her Rigging and got under her Stern and as fast as the  Manilla  Ship sent Men to clear her Rudder he prevented 'em with his Smallshot In the mean time we ventur'd to come along Side of her notwithstanding her monstrous Bulk and gave her such Entertainment that they call'd out at last for Quarter and struck their Colours I order'd all the Officers to come on Board which they did I receiv'd 'em all very civilly and immediately after went on Board the Prize I was amaz'd at her vast Bulk She had seven Decks and built so strong that not one of our Shot had gone through yet they had above sixty Men kill'd through their Ports and other Vacancies and what was very surprizing we had not one and but two wounded  They had above one hundred Men sick on Board 'em so that the Ship look'd like an Hospital It was very richly laden and valu'd at Dollars and upwards We found but little Money on Board besides the Plate belonging to the Governor of  Luconia  one of the  Philippine  Islands who was coming home to his own Country being a Native of  Mexico  Tho' this was the richest Prize that ever was taken yet we did not know well what to do with it It would be an Impossibility to work her into the North Sea or back again to the  East Indies  without farther help for we had more Prisoners by two to one than we had Sailors on Board So we once more advis'd with  Don Pedro  who counsell'd us to send to  Acapulco  and have the Ship and Men ransom'd  We all thought it would be both difficult and dangerous  Don Pedro  told us there should be neither and he would undertake to do it But however as it was a thing of very great Consequence we desir'd he would tell us in what manner it should be done Why as thus said he I'll take the Bark with the Captain of the  Spanish  Man of War the Quondam Governor and one or two more of the best Quality who shall make the Case known to the City of  Acapulco  and no other way but by Letter for I will suffer but one of them to go on Shore and I'll take care to order it well enough to give you Notice if they should send any Force against us tho' there is no Danger they should For added he they have no Man of War within two hundred Leagues of 'em that which was taken being all they had to guard their Coast We were well satisfied with his Reasons and gave him leave to proceed as he thought fit and accordingly the next Day he set Sail with those Persons mention'd along with him And by the Advice of all we follow'd him being very well convinc'd by the  Spaniards  themselves there was nothing of Force to be apprehended I had fitted up the  Spanish  Man of War again and resolv'd to keep her and dispose of the Bark Therefore assoon as we came within Sight of Land I order'd every thing to be taken out of her and put on Board the  Spaniard  who we found was a very good Sailor  The Day following  Don Pedro  came on Board with several Merchants and Persons of Quality to treat about the Ransom of the Prize and we agreed for Dollars after we had taken several Bales of rich Goods out of her The Money was to be paid in six Days and  we were to stay where we rode for I did not much care to trust 'em too far  In the mean time we sent all their sick and wounded on Shore The Bark we dispos'd of for Provision and other Necessaries and took the Opportunity of waiting for the Money to Water our Ships At the Time appointed the Money came and we surrender'd the Ship to the  Spaniards  Now we agreed by joint Consent to go home for we were all rich enough and every one of the Crew thought so Yet we resolv'd to touch at St  Salvador  on the Coast of  Brasil  and make our Way through the  Magellan  Straits as well to take in some Refreshments as to dispose of the rest of our Goods and careen our Vessels  Accordingly we put our Design in Execution and made the best of our Way for the Straits of  Magellan  and discover'd those noted Clouds which are a sure Guide to Sailors the third of  May  We found the Weather extreamly cold and the Mountains cover'd with Snow but we were well provided with good Liquors and all convenient Cloathing We anchor'd in  Port Famine  formerly call'd  Knight's Bay  by the  Dutch  in a Voyage with a Fleet of five Sail where meeting with many Troubles and to eternize the Memory of the Voyage it being the first the  Dutch  made to those Straits the Admiral knighted six of the Officers by the Title of Knights of the furious Lion The Oaths they receiv'd at the Ceremony were never to do or consent to do any thing against their Honours or to prejudice their present Voyage to expose their Lives for the Service of their Commonwealth and to do their utmost in driving the  Spaniards  from their  golden World They were install'd on Shore with a Seagreen Garter and a Table built with their Names engrav'd on it  We saw several of the Inhabitants who were easily prevail'd upon to come on Board us But I could find nothing extraordinary in their Height as is fabulously reported The tallest I could see among them did not exceed six Foot They are certainly a poor miserable People but very harmless and I am apt to believe all former Stories of their monstrous Height and Cruelty to be Fables  We got through the Straits once more into the North Sea and by degrees came into a warmer Climate But a terrible Storm overtook us just as we were in Sight of  Pepy  's Island which drove us within Sight of Port  Desire  upon the Continent and therefore we thought it the safest way to run into the Bay which accordingly we did and came to an Anchor in seventeen Fathom Water  At the South Side of the Port lies  Penguin  Island so call'd from a multiplicity of those Birds resorting there Our Men went on shore and in three Hours time brought on board five hundred of the Fowls and several thousands of their Eggs which prov'd delicious Food They are call'd  Penguin  not from their Fatness as some Authors affirm but from their Whiteness mix'd with black They are about the bigness of a Goose weighing between nine and fourteen Pound and tho' their chief Diet is Fish yet they have no fishy Taste Their Skin is very thick their Bill is like that of a Raven tho' not altogether so crooked their Neck is short and thick and the rest of their Body resembles a Goose excepting the Wings which are only two Stumps cover'd with Feathers which they make  Use of in Swimming Their Feet are black like those of a Swan They breed in Holes of the Rocks which are so numerous there is no walking hardly for fear of falling into them When they walk on Shore 'tis upright with their Wings hanging down so that they appear in that Posture like small Pigmies We staid but two Days here and then steer'd our Course for  Rio Janeiro  or the River of  January  intending to touch at St  Sebastian  's first and if we did not succeed there to sail for St  Salvador  When we arriv'd there the  Portugueze  would not admit us to enter the Bay but fir'd several Guns from the Forts laden with Shot to deter us from anchoring we could not imagine the meaning of it but however we left 'em in that Humour and steer'd for St  Salvador  and in one and twenty Days we discover'd  Praya de Zumba  a Place very easily known from a Number of white Spots which appear like Linnen hung out to whiten or dry  We past Fort St  Anthony  and saluted it with eleven Guns which return'd us an equal Number without the charge of Shot and came to an Anchor within half a League of the City which we also saluted with eleven Guns and receiv'd but seven in Return  By Advice of the Officers we shar'd among the Sailors a thousand Pieces of eight a Man which pleas'd 'em exceedingly The next Day I went to wait on the Governor who receiv'd me very civilly and desir'd I would dine with him We were very magnificently serv'd and a Band of  Italian  Music play'd all the while After Dinner I made my Presents which he accepted of very kindly but when I came to treat about our Commerce he flatly deny'd me telling me it was against the King of  Portugal  's  express Orders to suffer any Trading with Foreigners I begg'd his Pardon if it was not to be comply'd with He would have return'd my Present but I press'd him to accept it in so obliging a manner that he did and told me in  French  that since he saw my Generosity he would comply with me He immediately sent for several Merchants and took 'em into his Closet where they stay'd some time When they came out again the Governor told me those Gentlemen would go on Board and view our Commodities and if we could agree he would be answerable for the Money One of the Persons seem'd to be of a more free and open Disposition than the  Portugueze  generally are Tho' most of the Inhabitants of St  Salvador  affect the Manners of the  French  We soon made an End of our Bargain and my merry Merchant would oblige me to go ashore and sup with him that Night He press'd me so heartily that I could not refuse him and accordingly I went with only my two  Indian  Servants who began to be understood in  English  When we arriv'd at the Merchant's House I was surpriz'd to find it so magnificent He led us into a handsome Summerhouse in the Garden where he told me we were to sup and said he to convince you that you are welcome I'll bring my Wife and Daughter to keep us Company which is reckon'd as a thing extraordinary among us But added he I have been in  England  and  France  and I find the Women are not the less Honest for having their Liberty I told him I thought Constraint did but whet their Inventions to gain their Desires Said he I am of your Mind therefore give 'em all the Liberty they desire and I can't find I have had any reason to repent it  In a little time he usher'd in the two Ladies his Wife and Daughter both very beautiful and notwithstanding the Heat of the Climate very fair The Wife seem'd about five and thirty the Daughter about sixteen and they both spoke very good  French  Our Conversation was kept up with all the Spirit I was capable of I soon discover'd a great deal of Wit in them both and made 'em my Compliment in finding Ladies so extraordinary in so remote a Part of the World  When we had supp'd the Merchant whose Name was  Don Jaques  told me it was his Custom to provide Beds for his Guests as well as Supper And after we had walk'd a Turn or two round the Garden we all retir'd to our several Apartments  The next Morning we drank Chocolate together and I invited  Don Jaques  with his Wife and Daughter to dine with me on Board the next Day which he consented to I now begg'd Leave to be gone but it being very hot he had provided me a Silk  Palanquin  which is a Thing like a Hammock with a Canopy over it carry'd by two Blacks with each a Rest to hang it on while they take Breath This is all the Vehicle in Use at St  Salvador  by reason of the Unevenness and Steepness of the Situation  I prepar'd for them with all the Magnificence I could the next Day And when they saw the Variety of Dishes dress'd after the  English  Manner they were mightily pleas'd and to add to their Satisfaction the Musick I had on Board play'd several elegant Pieces accompany'd with the Trumpet I had got from on Board the  Spanish  Prize for notwithstanding his being Trumpeter to the Garrison of  Baldivia  yet he was better pleas'd to be where he was We drank the King of  England  and the King of  Portugal  's Health several times with the Discharge of our Cannon And when the Time for their going on Shore came I fasten'd a small Present of several sorts of Silk upon the Wife and Daughter  Don Jaques  perceiv'd what I was about and merrily said That is not fair we did not pay you for your Company Yesterday and yet I believe it was as valuable as that you receiv'd today at least in my Opinion I sha'n't answer for the Ladies said he they are both capable of speaking for themselves I receiv'd many Compliments on all Hands but not dealing much in them I am very willing to forget 'em  In a Day or two after  Don Jaques  came on Board and told me the Money for the Goods was ready but I should not have it unless I came my self to receive it I accordingly went with him and he made me continue there all Night where we had the Conversation of the Ladies as before  When I was going away the next Day he told me he should soon find if any thing else besides Money had the Power to bring me to see him I told him to convince him of that I would come and dine with him the next Day which accordingly I did After Dinner I express'd a Desire of seeing the most remarkable Places in the City which he comply'd with and order'd two  Palanquins  to carry us  The City of St  Salvador  the Capital of  Brasil  is situated in the Bay of  AllSaints  in Degrees Minutes Southern Latitude It is divided into two Towns the upper and the lower The Streets are strait and pretty broad but most of them very steep and all the Goods  are hoisted in and out of the Vessels by Machines for that purpose It was formerly under the Dominion of the  Spaniards  but taken from them by the  Dutch  in and pretty well fortify'd by them yet notwithstanding that the  Spaniards  retook it the next Year I could not learn how long the  Portugueze  have possess'd it but they all agree upwards of fifty Years They have made it a regular fortify'd Place and very strong having five Forts besides the Castle well stor'd with Cannon and other Ammunition and small Arms for ten thousand Men This is the usual Seat of the Viceroy of  Brasil▪  but when I was there it was without one tho' he was expected every Day  The Cathedral is a magnificent Pile of Building finely adorn'd and painted after the modern Manner The  Jesuits  Church is a noble Structure all of  European  Marble with a fine Organ the Pipes gilt There are many more fine Churches twenty in all besides several Convents and Monasteries  This Place is also the Residence of a Bishop who has a handsome Palace and for the Reverend the Clergy I never saw such a Number for the bigness of the Place any where as  Benedictines Franciscans Carmelites Augustins Capuchins Dominicans  and  Barefoot Fryars  tho' I think most of the People I saw there wore no Stockings There are three Nunneries well stor'd with Nuns but not to be seen nor hardly any Women in the Town but common Whores or black Slaves for the  Portugueze  lock up their Wives and Daughters as carefully as they do their Money and would have none look upon them but themselves except my Friend  Don Jaques  which is something the more extraordinary  It is a Place of great Trade to  Guinea  and other Parts and is accounted one of the richest Cities in the King of  Portugal  's Dominions By moderate Account there may be about Whites or I should say  Portugueze  for they are none of the whitest and about treble that Number of Slaves  Don Jaques  would make me take five Days up in viewing the several Parts of the City and oblig'd me to be at his House without going on Board during that Time Some Part of the Day we play'd at  Ombre  a Game mightily in Vogue among the  Spaniards  and  Portugueze  and a very entertaining Game for three invented by the jealous  Spaniards  for that Number to prevent any clandestine Doings between two But alas I believe there are more Opportunities gain'd than lost by it  We had provided every thing we wanted now and began to prepare for our Departure  Don Jaques  was very sorry to lose me he told me and indeed it was with some Regret I left him for his Civility had drawn from me a Friendship insensibly I went to take Leave of the Governour who made me a Present of  American  Sweetmeats and begg'd I would dine with him which I could not in good Manners deny When Dinner was over  Don Jaques  was so obligingly pressing for me to sup with him the last Time that I could not refuse but I begg'd he would excuse my staying all Night and he gave me his Word he would not press me I sent one of my  Indians  to order the Boat to fetch me at Ten that Evening  When the time of my Stay was expir'd I took my Leave of  Don Jaques  and the Family after having forc'd him to accept of a  Gold Watch and the Ladies a Present of each a Diamond Ring that I receiv'd from the Governour of  Luconia  for my Civility in returning him his Plate and Jewels when we took the  Acapulco  Ship in the  SouthSea  Well said  Don Jaques  I see you will pay for your Board in spight of my Teeth I had taken Leave of the Wife and Daughter before who had left us in Tears I must own I thought my self very much oblig'd for their Tenderness and it drew such a deep Melancholy upon my Face with Thoughts of my dear Wife that  Don Jaques  imagin'd it was Grief for parting with him and his Family I did not take any Pains to undeceive him Well said he I see a Friendship may be contracted in a few Days as well as Love especially where there is a Harmony of Souls  We had agreed to correspond together and I had undertaken to send him some  European  Goods if it pleas'd God to guard me safe to  Europe  I had continu'd longer with  Don Jaques  than I had intended to do therefore whatever Violence I did my self I took my Leave  Don Jaques  tenderly embrac'd me and was so much overwhelm'd with Grief that I could not forbear sympathizing with him But I order'd his Servants whom I had liberally rewarded for the Trouble I gave to shut the Door to prevent their Master's going any farther  I walk'd towards the Port very melancholy though with some Precipitation but was rouz'd out of it by one of my  Indians  crying Master take a Care take a Care I turn'd about and saw four  Portugueze  pursuing us I made a Stand and drew my Sword took my Cloak from my  Indian  and put it across my Arm to  defend my self the better They all four attack'd me at once but my  Indians  whom I had order'd to wear Swords on Shore fell upon 'em furiously and dispatch'd two of 'em immediately and I had made a shift to drop a third though not without receiving several Wounds The fourth ran for it but my  Indians  being as nimblefooted as Does soon overtook him and dragg'd him down the Hill by the Hair of his Head while he cry'd out all the while  Misericordia Misericordia  The Noise we made had brought up my Boat's Crew who were all arm'd with Pistols and Cutlasses and the Guard coming in the mean time and seeing my  Indians  dragging the Fugitive fell upon us But my Crew and  Indians  charg'd 'em so furiously that they soon put 'em to Flight though treble our Number Though this avail'd us but little for the whole Garrison was coming down upon us I then order'd my Crew to resist no more but submit to 'em for as we were innocent I did not much fear to come off clear  The Bustle had rouz'd  Don Jaques  and his Servants who were soon inform'd of the Condition I was in and he came in good time to interpose his Authority for the  Portugueze  began to be outragious But the Governour had sent a Gentleman to bring us before him And accordingly I went accompanied by  Don Jaques  But the Wounds I had received bled so much that they were oblig'd to carry me to  Don Jaques  's and send for a Surgeon My Hurts were not dangerous but I was very faint with Loss of Blood  Don Jaques  waited on the Governour and inform'd him of the Condition I was in But the Governour not understanding who was the Aggressor order'd a Guard of Soldiers at the  Door of the House where I was My Boat's Crew soon got on Board and alarm'd both the Ships who immediately weigh'd and came close to Shore where they had prepar'd to fire upon the Town if I was not releas'd instantly I understanding the Matter sent one to inform them that the Guard was set upon me to secure me from the Insults of the  Portugueze  till the Truth of the Matter was discovered This would not serve their Turn but a hundred of 'em with the Officers and  Don Pedro  landed all well arm'd and vow'd to wait the Event on Shore The Governour did me the Honour of a Visit and enquir'd into the Cause and I inform'd him as well as my Weakness would permit me When they had examin'd the dead  Portugueze  they found one of them was Nephew to the deceas'd Viceroy Upon the Discovery of which the  Portugueze  began to be very much exasperated and were hardly restrain'd from rushing into the House and tearing me to Pieces for though they did not regard the Nephew yet they had a great Veneration for his deceas'd Uncle who behav'd himself with a great deal of Candour in his Post and the Inhabitants mightily regretted his Loss The Governour appeas'd their Fury by telling 'em I should have no Favour shewn me if I were guilty let the Consequence be what it would And immediately a Court was summon'd to try me tho' it was Midnight and I was carry'd there in a  Palanquin  weak as I was But I was oblig'd to send for my Lieutenant and tell him that there was no Danger and also order'd him to send the Crew on Board again When we came to the Place of Justice the Governour order'd me a Seat But the Business was soon ended for the  Portugueze  we had secur'd own'd that his Master had design'd to murder me because he was inform'd I was his Rival in the beautiful  Donna Bianca  which was the Daughter of  Don Jaques  I was very much surpris'd as well as  Don Jaques  at this Report and we both declar'd it was only a jealous Suggestion of the Gentleman which every one came into And the Grounds he had for it was my often frequenting  Don Jaques  's House upon the score of Friendship only and lodging there  The Governor handsomely dismist me and told me he was very sorry I had been detain'd from my Affairs I return'd that I was as sorry to be the Cause of so unhappy an Accident in a Country where I had receiv'd so much Civility  Don Jaques  begg'd I would go back to his House and stay till my Wounds were well but the Governour took us aside and said to us in  French  I know  Don Jaques  'tis your Friendship for the Captain that makes you desire his Company but if I might advise you I would have him go on Board upon the Instant for though he is very innocent as to the Matter yet I doubt some of the Deceased's Friends or Relations which are numerous not having Regard to Justice will contrive some Method to dispatch him out of the Way for most of the  Portugueze  are jealous malicious and revengeful and very seldom look into the Merits of the Cause  I thank'd the Governour for his kind Caution and  Don Jaques  notwithstanding his Friendship could not but come into what he had said I therefore order'd my self to be carried on Board that Moment It being broad Day the Governour and his Guard would accompany me to the Waterside but  Don Jaques  would go on Board with me In the Boat he told me he had some Thoughts of coming to reside in  England  for said he I have enough and therefore I will in two or three Years more leave off Traffick and live quiet in the World But he begg'd I would write to him assoon as I arriv'd in  Europe  and let him know the Place I had chose to live in for added he let it be where it will if it is ever my Fortune to arrive safe in  Europe  I'll take another Voyage only for the Hopes of seeing you I return'd him the Acknowledgment due to so much Friendship and we parted with Tears on both sides  Assoon as I had got on Board the Wind being fair we weigh'd and stood out of the Bay When we were out at Sea a Letter was brought me written in  French  the Translation of which is as follows  SIR  I  Was resolv'd to make Tryal of you before I suffer'd my Heart to chuse you for a Friend▪ and I am so well convinc'd of the Sincerity of your Soul that I will confide in you a Secret dear to my Repose I had an Amour with a beautiful Lady before I was marry'd that produc'd the Bearer of this Letter I have kept him conceal'd from my Family hitherto but the Person I trusted with his Education and this Secret being dead I fear'd I should find some Difficulty to conceal him any longer here Therefore depending upon your good Nature and Friendship I have ventur'd to send him to you with Sufficient to bear his Expences in his Education which I would have suitable to the Estate I have in my Power to give him I shall  ever own this Obligation and always think it my greatest Happiness to subscribe my self  Your sincere Friend and Servant Jaques de Ramires  I must own I was very much surpriz'd at this Epistle and could not imagine his Reasons for concealing it from me I order'd the Person that brought the Letter to be conducted in and immediately enter'd my Cabin one of the beautifullest Boys I had ever set my Eyes on He seem'd about Fifteen his Hair fair and long curling down his Shoulders In short every Feature so exact and uniform and so innocent withal that I was amaz'd At last I took him by the Hand and embrac'd him and told him for his Father's sake he should be as dear to me as my own Son But finding he did not answer me for I spoke to him in  English  I repeated the same in  French  He return'd me Thanks and said he did not doubt but he should find it so  After some time he deliver'd me a Casket in which were Jewels to the Value of five thousand Pistoles and a little Box which contain'd a thousand Moidores I told him I would take as much Care of them as if they were my own  These Sir said the Youth are design'd to bear my Charges Then ordering another Box in had it open'd and told me what it contain'd was a Present from his Father to me When I examin'd it I found six Silver Dishes and three dozen of Plates of the same Metal a dozen of Knives Forks and Spoons in Gold and half a dozen of Gold Sweetmeat Plates  In a larger Box was variety of all manner of Conserves and Cordials and I was informed he had made small Presents to every Officer in the Ship and to the common Sailors a Week's fresh Provision with Liquor in proportion I was amaz'd at his Bounty for his Present to me was what a Prince might have receiv'd I thought it was my Duty to shew all the Kindness I was capable of to the Son of so generous a Father therefore I order'd him a FieldBed in my own Cabin and his Behaviour was so engaging that I felt as much Tenderness for him as if he had really been my own Child and having Skill in Surgery I trusted him with the Management of my Wounds though I had a very good ShipSurgeon who supply'd him with what he wanted My Hurts which were not dangerous soon heal'd and I recover'd my Strength again I could not prevail upon young  Don Ferdinand Don Jaques  's Son to go often upon Deck He said he would rather chuse to stay in the Cabin where he had  French  Books of his own and some of mine to entertain him for I had taken my Opportunity to procure several at St  Salvador  and among the rest a  French  and  English  Grammar and Dictionary which mightily pleas'd  Don Ferdinand  for he had a great Desire to learn  English  I gave him all the Helps I could and he in return instructed me in the  Portugueze  Language so that in a short time we could discourse in either  We had resolv'd to steer our Course for the Island of  Tercera  the Capital of the  Azores  and after fifty Days Sail we discover'd the Peak of one of the Islands of  Azores  which is called  Pico  from the Mountain It is in the Resemblance of a Pyramid and may be discovered as many Leagues off as the  Pike of Teneriff  for  we were then by Observation thirty Leagues off from it and yet could see it distinctly  In two Days more we discover'd the Island of St  Michael  We were all pleas'd that we had enter'd that Part of the World we call  Europe  the Birthplace of most of us and what pleas'd us more was that we had made all our Fortunes  August  the th we anchor'd in the Bay of  Angra  the Capital of the  Azores  in the Island  Tercera  I can't give any great Commendation to the Port being I think it a very indifferent one We did not design to stay long only to get some Water and some fresh Provisions for we were inform'd there was no riding out a Storm there We got in what we wanted with all Expedition we could while the Weather was favourable  The City is seated at the Bottom of the Bay under the Brow of a Hill call'd  Monto de Brasil  or the  Brasil  Mountain but for what reason so call'd I could not be inform'd It is very well fortify'd having two strong Castles and eight Batteries besides with Guns of thirty Pounds Shot But it is very indifferently garrison'd having no more than two hundred Men in Pay and most wretchedly supply'd having no cloathing for three Years  The Town is very agreeable having a Stream of Water running quite through it which drives several Miles for the Use of the Publick and almost in every Quarter are publick Fountains of excellent tasted Water From this Place are brought the finest CanaryBirds tho' less than those of the  Canaries  yet they exceed 'em far in the Excellency of their Pipes  Money is very scarce here and consequently every thing cheap I bought two Months Biscuit for the Ships much cheaper than in any  Port of  Europe  Corn is their chief Commodity which they send to  Portugal  but for any other Trade I believe the King of  Portugal  gets but little Advantage  I was grown such a Proficient in the  Portugueze  Tongue that I could make a shift to be understood and by understanding that Language soon found a Gate to the  Spanish  Tongue by the help of  Don Pedro  who had learnt to speak  English  very fluently We got acquainted with one of the Fathers of the  Cordeliers  who shew'd us the Churches and other things of Note in the City The Cathedral is a very handsome Building and well painted which goes by the Name of St  Salvador  and there is no danger of missing that Title and St  Anthony  every where among the  Portugueze  There's no less than twenty besides the Cathedral with four Monasteries and four Convents that have each their Chapel beautifully adorn'd When we had got what Refreshments were wanting we set sail for the  Straits  intending to touch no where before we were got into the  Mediterranean  and because we met with nothing extraordinary in our Voyage to  Gibralter  I will to divert the Reader give him instead of Bearing of Coasts Changes of Wind and unexpected Storms the Life of my Companion  Don Pedro Aquilio  which he related to us during the Voyage in the following Manner  THE LIFE OF  Don PEDRO AQUILIO  _MY Father residing in  France  when the Commotions were ingendring between the King and the Parliament was made fast to the Interest of Cardinal  De Retz  by marrying one of his Neices of a very great Fortune He had a Hand in most of the secret Transactions of those Times and wading too deep in those Seas of Trouble was obliged to retire to his native Country He foreseeing what would happen took care of his Affairs accordingly sold his Estate in  France  and sent my Mother to  Sevil  the Place of his Birth whither he soon follow'd The King of  Spain  having a very great Regard for him gave him several Offices of Honour and Prosit and when I was born I was Son to the first Man in the City My Father by living so long in  France  had contracted the Manners of the  French  and the Formality of the  Spaniard  seem'd as strange to him as if he had been born in another Climate He had several Children  tho' none surviv'd but my self When I had Years enough over my Head to fear the Prejudice of Education he took a Resolution of sending me to the College of the four Nations in  Paris  to compleat my Studies And the first thing I learnt was to shake off all the Customs of  Spain  which was soon done for they had taken but small Impression in my Mind because I found my Father was averse to 'em I contracted a Friendship with several young  French  Noblemen of my own Age for Parity of Years is the first Step to Friendship  When I had reach'd my fifteenth Year I began to think of a Mistress to compleat my Studies And as I found it was a Method among my Companions to supplant each other in their Females without any Animosity I set my self so willingly about it that out of half a dozen  Madonas  I made my self Master of six of 'em This occasion'd many Plots and Contrivances to regain the flying Fair Ones Tho' I perceiv'd most Money laid out in Presents had a prevailing Force with 'em We had our Allowance paid quarterly and getting all my Companions into gaming I had the good Fortune to strip 'em all They seem'd to be a little uneasy in losing their Mistresses and Money too and my telling 'em as I had got the Females I should have the most occasion for the Money signify'd nothing but they all begg'd it as a great Favour that I would lend 'em half what I had won to be repaid the next Quarter which to oblige 'em I comply'd with and to play we fell again but Fortune chang'd her amiable Looks from me and I soon lost all I had won with my own Share too The fickle Dame favour'd one of the Company that would not lend any of us a Penny This chagrin'd the rest very much But to prevent  any more Importunity he went away to his own Chamber leaving room in all our Pockets for the Devil to dance a Saraband for we had not one Cross to keep him out and what was our greatest Mortification the Holydays were approaching that us'd to give us the Opportunity of rambling into the Country The Person that won our Money happen'd to be the last that was added to our Society and tho' he had not been long among us we began to be tir'd of him as much from his odd Humours as his Effeminacy I at last thought of a Project to be reveng'd on him and it was very much approv'd by the rest of my Companions The Holydays being come we design'd for our Country Rendezvous but he that bore the Purse would not go with us without we could produce every one so much Money This put us to our Shifts again But my Man who was an arch Wag begg'd that I would accept of what he had for I had been so lucky as to have paid him his Wages before my Loss I accepted of his Offer and took from him ten  Lewis d'Ors  We contriv'd it so well that they were shown to old Sir Snip from every Person of our Society Well said he sixty  Lewis d'Ors  will do our Business but who should be Pursebearer was what he cavil'd at and not caring to trust any of us and we resolv'd not to trust him he pitch'd upon my Man to be Cashkeeper for us all And accordingly he put down in his Pocketbook so much Money in Bank receiv'd of such and such Persons when in reality he had but twenty  Lewis d'Ors  When we had contriv'd every thing we took Horse and rode six Leagues that Evening to the Place where we design'd to put in Execution our Project We had agreed to pay every  Night the Expences of the Day and have it set down in my Man's Book But when he was call'd for as we had concerted no Man was to be found There was strange Enquiry made to no purpose and we all agreed he had taken the Opportunity to rob us and run away with our Money All that we had to do was to beg of Snip to discharge the House But he declar'd he had not half a Pistole in his Pocket which we knew very well for he had sew'd all the rest into his Wastecoat Since it falls out so unluckily said I don't let us make known our Wants to the House but go to rest and consult tomorrow I lay with Snip for fear he should take it into his Head to sneak off In the Night when I found he was fast asleep I bundled up all his Cloaths and threw them out of the Window to my Man that waited for them  When Morning came I desir'd him to rise that we might get all together to consult but no Cloaths were to be found He began to storm and swear but all to no purpose for not one of his Oaths would bring back a Rag of his Cloaths He told us in his Ravings that he had lost so much Money sew'd up in his Wastecoat We upbraided him for his Covetousness in not letting us share with him but it did not signifie any thing He threaten'd to go to the  Provost  and have the Landlord secur'd and would have don't if he had not been naked  After raving to no Purpose he was oblig'd to go to Bed again to avoid catching cold He ask'd us what he should do in his Condition but all the Advice we gave him brought him no Consolation  He was very tall and large made and we us'd to call him in Ridicule the  Infant  He propos'd to sell his Horse to cloath him but being so much out of Size there was not any thing to be had ready made that would fit him This was still worse and worse and tho' the Horse was sold for twenty  Pistoles  we contriv'd it so that my Landlord seiz'd the Money for his Reckoning This put him almost beside himself and he was ready to expire with Vexation  I pretended to be much concern'd at this Usage while the rest of our Company laugh'd at his Misfortune I seem'd to be very angry with them and told 'em I would do my Endeavour to remedy every thing I made 'em acquainted that I had just call'd to mind a Person a Friend of mine that liv'd in the Town much of the Infant's Size and I would go to borrow a Suit of Cloaths for him He seem'd very much rejoyc'd at this for he resolv'd assoon as ever he was dress'd to take up the  Landlord  and swear the Robbery against him  I went as he suppos'd about his Cloaths and after staying some time below I went up with a Bundle and seem'd very much concern'd that I could not succeed I told the  Infant  the Gentleman was gone to  Lyons  about Business of Concern and had carry'd all his Cloaths with him But I had brought him a Masquerade Habit that he had left behind him  He express'd some Satisfaction at the Sight of it that he should not be confin'd to lie in Bed But said he if it were not only for the Name of Cloaths a Man might as well go naked for there's no stirring abroad in this Dress  It was the Habit of a Satyr that we had made on purpose for the Occasion before we left  Paris  When we had equip'd him it was as much as I  could do to keep my Countenance at the Figure he made and he seem'd very much dissatisfy'd with it but however he wore it for the Conveniency of not lying in Bed  When we were at Dinner we had many Contrivances to get away but none feazable  I told 'em at last I had thought of a Design would certainly do our Business and make up our Losses if the  Infant  would consent to it He readily reply'd he would stick at nothing to do that Why then said I if you'll suffer your self to be shown in that Habit as a Monster newly arriv'd I'll answer for the Success of it  After much talk he agreed to do it on this Proviso that his Face should be disguis'd I told him I would step to my Friend's House for the Mask that was made to the Habit I return'd and gave it to him and he was soon satisfy'd with the Project  Notwithstanding the Bustle we made none of the House but the Landlord knew any thing of the Matter and the next Day it was given out about the Town that a Monster was to be shown in the Afternoon We had procur'd a Chain and other Materials to carry on the Joke and when the time came to show away we had such a Concourse of People to see our Monster it being in the Holydays that our Profit gave us some Satisfaction For when the time of showing was over our Money amounted to three and twenty  Pistoles  and the Monster behav'd himself so well with our Instructions that he gave a general Content  We had taken care he should appear so fierce that none should approach near enough to discover the Deceit We had a great deal of Diversion at the ignorant People's Suggestions One Country Fellow ask'd how old he was I told  him four Years three Months and five Days Lord bless me cry'd he out why by that time he comes to be twenty no House will be able to hold him  In fine we show'd him so long that our Money mounted to upwards of one hundred Pounds which pleas'd our  Infant  so well that he desir'd to continue a Monster all the time of the Holydays But we resolv'd to carry the Joke no further tho' we did not tell him so  We left the  Infant  chain'd to the Post of the Window as usual went down to my Landlord and gave him Instructions how to behave himself We took care to satisfy him very well for the Trouble he had been at  We all rid away to the next Village and putting up our Horses return'd on Foot one by one back again to the Inn and stole up Stairs unperceiv'd by any one but the Landlord The  Infant  finding we staid longer than ordinary began to make a great Noise which my Landlord hearing sent up one of his Servants that knew nothing of the Secret when the  Infant  saw him come in he made several Signs to him but as the Fellow knew nothing of the Jest he did not much like the Action of the  Infant  but ran down to his Master frighted out of his Wits  We had made Peepholes in the bordering Room where we could perceive every Action of the  Infant  's but he was so very much enrag'd that he sat down biting his Nails for Vexation for he began to perceive the Trick we had put upon him After sitting Melancholy some time he rose up and endeavour'd to undo the Chains but as they were ty'd close behind and made fast to a Staple in the Wall all his Efforts prov'd vain All our care was to contain from laughing  which was a very hard Task When he found he could not free himself Rage entirely possess'd him and the Noise he made with stamping and rattling his Chains brought up several of the Servants arm'd who open'd the Door cautiously but notwithstanding their Valour ran away assoon as they perceiv'd his menacing Action and tumbling over one another took the shortest way down Stairs  When we thought he had Mortification enough we sent my Landlord into him with a good Horsewhip and a Letter in his Hand Assoon as he had got within the Door he spoke after this manner in a Landlordlike Tone I was pretty well assur'd at the beginning that thou wert a rank Cheat but now I am convinc'd of it I will chastise thee first and reason with thee afterwards like other criminal Judges punish first and enquire into the Demerits of the Cause afterwards that Justice may not wait for any body  These Words were follow'd with some smart Strokes and the Dialogue soon began to be in much Confusion for between the roaring of the Infant the bawling of my Landlord and the smacking of the Whip it was a continual jargon of Noise And we were obliged all of us to own our Host executed his Commission to a Hair  When he had a little recover'd himself he began to reason with his Patient who that he might the better hear him laid himself down on his Pallate to condole his afflicted Body But their Questions being very long and the Answers but short consisting of two Monosyllables Ay or No I will not trouble you with the Relation  After their Dialogue was over he gave him the Letter which discovered our Design upon him He was thunderstruck at our Combination and utter'd such Imprecations of Revenge that my Landlord was oblig'd to answer him with his Whip which soon reduc'd him to Reason  We began to be tir'd with our  Infant  and so put an end to our Diversion and his Torture by sending him his Cloaths tho' some of our Company would have had him gone to  Paris  in that Trim  In a few Days after the Frolick was over he commenc'd a Suit of Law against us all for a Robbery but the Judges finding it only a Trick of Mirth fined every one of the Defendants six Livres apiece and every one to pay his own Costs This but enrag'd the  Infant  the more and he began to meditate a more pernicious Revenge for now he appear'd the Ridicule of the whole City and he could never stir without a Train of Boys at his Heels  The first Instance of it was as follows My Servant having some Intrigue on his Hands had made bold with my Cloaths to carry it on and coming home pretty late was shot thro' the Back with a Pistol Ball just as he was entring the College Gates Though it was well meant the poor Fellow escap'd with Life yet he lay dangerously ill for several Days He could give no Account of the Affair at all not having seen the Person that wounded him But the Accident made me very uneasie for I was convinc'd the Favour was meant to me This made me cautious how I ventur'd out of the College for it was easie to imagine it was a Proof of the  Infant  's Resentment who had left the College upon the loss of his Tryal  I began now to repent our Confederacy against him and wrote him a Note to assure him of my Contrition with my Share of the Money we had taken from him He receiv'd the Cash and sent me Word he heartily forgave me Imagining him sincere I ventur'd into the City and soon frequented my old Rendezvous but I had so much Regard for my self as to get to College betimes  One Night as I was going home four Men in Vizor Masks rush'd out from behind a Wall of a House that was building They all fir'd upon me and ran away assoon as they had discharg'd their Pieces I must confess at first Fear made me imagine my self no Man of this World But by degrees getting over my Apprehension I found I had not got any Hurt This Accident to me seem'd prodigious for they were all four so near me that several Grains of the Powder stuck in my Face But I was brought out of my Labyrinth of Thought when I receiv'd the following Letter the next Morning  SIR  I  Must own my self one of those unfortunate Men that for want of better Employment receive Money as the Price of Blood Though this I can say with a clear Conscience I never have yet put my Trade in Practice Yesterday Morning I was sent for to the House of Monsieur  Gomberville  commonly call'd the  Infant  who employed me to take away your Life and that he would be sure of the Execution made one of the four that fir'd upon you last Night but as I had the ordering of our Arms I took care nothing should be put in 'em that was hurtful The Acquaintance I had with your noble Father made me the more cautious  concerning his Son I beg in Justice to me you would keep your Chamber and cause it to be reported that you are dangerously wounded I need not caution you to be careful of your self for the  Infant  's Malice seems to me implacable We never have any Words made of these Things because we know how to revenge our selves therefore let no one else know the Contents of this and be thankful for your Life from  Jaques Marriot  When I had read the Letter I order'd my Servant to bring the Bearer before me where I soon found by his manner of Talking that a little Money would be very acceptable to the Sender and therefore I sent him ten Pistoles with my humble Service giving him to know that I would exactly comply with the Contents  I began now seriously to think on the Danger I had inconsiderately drawn upon my self for an innocent Frolick and that it would be but ill trusting to the  Infant  's Resentment I gave out that I was dangerously wounded and the better to carry it on I got a Surgeon a Friend of mine to visit me frequently  When I had kept my Chamber long enough for the time of my Cure I ventur'd abroad but never without four or five of my Friends for a Guard and came home in very good Time  During my Confinement I receiv'd Letters of Condolement from several of my Mistresses and when they heard of my Recovery as many of Reproach for not coming to visit them as usual One in particular and my favourite Fair was very pressing for a Meeting and her chief Reason was to pay her with my Presence for the Affronts she had sustain'd from the  Infant  upon my Account I sent her Word I would not fail waiting on her the  Sunday  following after Dusk Accordingly when the time came I stole out without any of the College Marks on and arriv'd safe at my  Madona  's  After Supper and two or three Bottles of  Hermitage  we went to Bed and when we had made our selves as merry as we could in the dark I address'd my self to Sleep But notwithstanding my willingness to receive the gentle God he still flew from me and several Hours pass'd without closing my Eyes  About Midnight I thought I heard Whispers in the next Room which very much alarm'd me But my Fears were trebly increas'd when looking through a Chink of the Door I discover'd the  Infant  and four other Fellows with Masks in their Hands spreading Sawdust on the Floor and on the Table lay several Sacks  I soon imagin'd what their Preparations meant therefore consulted my Safety as well as I could in the Confusion of my Thoughts  I went always well arm'd since the last Rencounter having two Brace of Pistols in my Pockets a good cutting Sword and a Stilletto But I was confounded when searching for my Cloaths where I had laid them none could be found I now began to think of Death seriously and beg Pardon sincerely of God for all my Sins for I knew it would be Madness to think of escaping naked as I was without any Thing for my Defnce In the Chaos of my Thoughts I remembred a Closet which had a Window that look'd into the  Seine  and tho' it was three Stories from the River yet as I could swim I thought it better to trust Providence by leaping into the Water than those Cutthroats I stole softly to the Window  but to my great Consternation found it too fast for me to open but by good Fortune in groping about I found my Cloaths I put 'em on with a great deal of Precipitation and having prepar'd my Arms resolv'd not to die alone  I waited some Time before the Chamber Door open'd When it was open I could perceive 'em coming in with Masks on and the foremost with a Darklanthorn I did not think fit to wait till they should discover I was not in the Bed but rush'd on the first and shot him dead on the Spot and in two seconds of a Minute dispatch'd two more one▪ with my Sword and the other with one of my Pistols and had made as quick work with the other two but they fell on their Knees and begg'd for Mercy which I granted on Condition that one should tye the other which was readily comply'd with when that was done I bound the other my self and coming to secure my false Mistress found her expiring in the Bed She had Breath enough left to tell me she had been caught in her own Trap for designing to poison me in the Wine I drank the Servant had mistaken the Bottle and given it to her  I ask'd her the Reason of her Hatred to me being as I remember'd guilty of no Fault She told me the  Infant  had inform'd her that I was false to her which converted her Love to the most implacable Hatred I must own this Woman was Mistress of my Heart and I had several Proofs of her Sincerity but she was of a Temper compos'd of Fire and Fury She further told me that I had rais'd her Rage to that height that she was resolv'd to put an end to my Life her self not caring to trust her Revenge to any Hands but her own  She begg'd I would forgive her and immediately expired I examin'd my two intended Murderers and found they were Servants to the  Infant  and compell'd to what they did therefore I resolv'd to pardon 'em  I thought once of going to the Provost and give him a particular Account of the Action but one of the Fellows inform'd me he was a near Relation of the  Infant  's and had a very great Love for him which made me apprehend his Passion would overcome his Justice Therefore I resolv'd the next Morning to set out for  Spain  which I put in practice before Day and gave my Man Orders to follow me  I left  Paris  with this Reflection that from the meanest triffling Accident often dreadful Effects follow'd and a Woman once provok'd was the most dangerous Enemy a Man could have  I met with nothing extraordinary in my Voyage to  Cales  but when I arriv'd at  Sevil  I was inform'd my Father who was Governor of that City was at his Countryhouse about six Leagues off  Tho' I was very much fatigu'd with my Journey I resolv'd to wait on him that Night I hir'd a Mule for I had my Servant's Cloaths on and set out But my Beast being none of the best tir'd with me about a League before I came to the Villa where my Father resided  I left him in the adjacent Village and pursu'd my Journey on Foot As I was willing to get to my Father's House I made all the Speed I could And tho' it was very dark I knew the Way perfectly  I overtook two Men in a narrow Lane that call'd to me asking why I had stay'd so long and where was  Don Lewis  I fancy'd there was something of Villany going forward by the Name of Don  Lewis  being he was an inveterate Enemy of my Father's I did not answer 'em immediately which brought 'em upon me they soon found their Mistake They ask'd me where I was going at that time of Night I told 'em I was going to  Saragoza  to my Friends for I had serv'd a Gentleman in  Cadiz  that had discharg'd me for getting his Maid with Child and I was obliged to walk all Night being I had not any Money to pay for a Lodging I answer'd a great many other Questions with the same Truth and Simplicity And after talking some time two more came up to us and ask'd the others who they had got with 'em They went all together and after a little talk one that seem'd to be the Superior came up to me and told me if I would make one of their Enterprize that Night he would not only reward me well but take me into his Service but if I refus'd after he had disclos'd it to me they would murder me upon the Instant  I told him I would stick at nothing to get Bread Why then said Sir Gravity my Name is Don  Lewis  I have a mortal hatred to  Ferdinand Aquilio  Governor of  Sevil  I have waited many Years for my Revenge but never could get an Opportunity to execute it till now He has receiv'd one of my Servants into his House as a Domestic who this Night will open the Door to us where I shall quench my Hatred of him with his Blood and further to dispatch all fear of Resistance I can assure you there are but two more Servants in the House whom my Fellow has made drunk which shall be order'd so as if they had murder'd their Master  It was well for me that Darkness cover'd the Hemisphere or the old Devil could have discover'd the Confusion in my Countenance But notwithstanding my Consternation I told him I should be proud to serve him in this or any other Adventure Gramercy said the old One and here's something to encourage thee clapping a handful of Dollars into my Hand  I'll leave you to guess the Confusion of my Thoughts at this Declaration and I was casting about in my Mind how I should prevent this intended Villany  When we arriv'd at my Father's we found the Treacherous Villain wating for his Master Assoon as ever he saw us he cry'd softly to Don  Lewis  I am glad your Honour is come but Don  Ferdinand  is in his Closet and does not intend to go to Bed tonight because he is to be at  Sevil  early in the Morning and he has shut his Closetdoor Why then said Don  Lewis  we'll break it open But return'd the Servant he has Arms always ready in his Closet and I fear the Enterprize will be a little Difficult for he's a tough old Blade  Upon this Account a small Pause ensu'd which gave me Leisure to think and to the Old one I utter'd my Thoughts  Sir said I submit this Business to me and I'll inform you how I design to execute it Your Servant shall accompany me to the Door of his Closet and knock and assoon as ever he opens it I'll give a good Account of the old Gentleman  Thou counsellest well reply'd the old Don and I'll reward thee accordingly when the Work is done And I shall deserve it thought I to my self if my Intention succeeds  Upon this Resolve we went into the House and the Fellow conducted me up Stairs very softly The Closet was at the end of a large Room the Door of which I bolted on the Inside with one Hand and plung'd my Ponyard to the Heart of the Fellow with the other who drop'd dead at my Feet At the Noise he made in falling my Father cry'd out Who's there and rush'd out of his Closet with a Pistol in his Hand I reply'd 'Tis I your Son  You may imagine the Surprize my Father was in at this sudden Appearance and to see one of his Servants weltring in Blood and dead before me Sir said I banish your Surprize and go with me into your Closet where I will inform you of this sudden and unlook'dfor Appearance and must farther add that the Hand of Providence by me has sav'd you from Death  My Father follow'd me into his Study without speaking Where I declar'd in as few Words as the Time would permit all that had befallen me that Night and we soon came to a Resolution what to do  We took each of us a Blunderbuss with a brace of Pistols went down the back Stairs and came in upon 'em a way they little expected I came first into the Hall as we had concerted  Assoon as the old Wretch saw me he cry'd Well my Lad hast thou dispatch'd the Villain Yes Sir said I and have drag'd him down that you may behold what I have done When he heard that he gave a Leap for Joy and came running forward to view the pleasing Sight But Words cannot express his Looks when he saw my Father confronting him with a Bluderbuss in his Hand He stood motionless as if he had been turn'd to Stone  The other three endeavour'd to make their Escape but I discharg'd my Blunderbuss and stopt two of them with my hasty Messengers The Report of my Piece made  Don Lewis  fall down as imagining himself slain the third Person finding it impossible to escape became desperate and like a Stag at Bay defy'd us He pull'd out a Stilletto and ran upon me like an angry Lyon and notwithstanding I shot him in the Breast with a Brace of Balls wounded me in three several Places I grappling with him we came down together upon the Body of  Don Lewis  who with our Weight began to cry out and that Moment had been the last of my Life if my Father had not ran to my Assistance and with his Sword nail'd my Antagonist to the Pavement  The Report of our FireArms had waken'd the two drunken Servants of my Father who came half frighten'd out of their Senses By this time  Don Lewis  had recover'd himself and seeing Death before him fell down upon his Knees and implor'd my Father's Mercy  Thou base Man reply'd my Father how canst thou expect to live after thy barbarous Attempt upon his Life that never wrong'd thee He told him he did not expect to be forgiven only to be allow'd a Priest and Confession and he would die with a hearty Penitence for his Sins  Wretch cry'd my Father thou may'st see how Heaven abhors thy Fact by blasting thy Design This Man thou seest before thee whom thou didst employ in thy black Design is my own Son whose coming hither was like an Angel sent from Heaven to my Assistance I see return'd the  Don  the Seal of Providence is upon you and I heartily repent the Crime I  intended to commit And if you will forgive me and forget what is past I'll esteem you as the Saver of my Life and to unite our Friendship I'll match my Daughter with a noble Dowry to this your Son and may they ever live happy  My Father was too much a Gentleman to murder in cold Blood though he had sufficient Excuse on his side if he had done it On the other hand his Daughter was a very great Fortune even beyond his Hopes  After some small Pause he made him this Reply Sir you know within your self that you have forfeited your Life by the Law in so basely attempting mine but as I can forgive any Injury design'd me if you perform your first Promise I am resolv'd to forgive all that's past Sir reply'd the other transported with Joy I am so much oblig'd to you for my Life that I will not stir out of your House till I have sign'd Articles of Agreement and I must farther add that nothing sets my Shame more before my Eyes than this your Goodness  My Father begg'd he would take a particular Care how he gave way to Hatred which by the way only commenc'd in my Father's getting the better of him in a LawSuit and was heighten'd by the King's conferring on him the Honour of the Government of  Sevil  which  Don Lovis  had some Hopes of  We took care the next Day to let the Country know that those Fellows that were kill'd had attempted to rob our House but we having timely Notice had prevented 'em by their Deaths  The old Gentleman was as good as his Word for Articles of Agreement were drawn up between  'em and I had Leave to visit the Lady when I thought fit But I was obliged to go back to  Sevil  to put my self in an Equipage suitable to the Occasion and  Don Lewis  follow'd after with his Daughter  I must confess I was charm'd with her Person at the first Interview and the Day was fix'd for our Nuptials which rejoic'd the whole City of  Sevil  that two of the noblest Houses were going to bury in Oblivion their long Enmity  I took the Privilege of an intended Husband in my Visits to my design'd Bride and in her Conversation found she had no Aversion for me at least I thought so and I promis'd my self the utmost Felicity in her Enjoyment  One Morning about a Week before the intended Wedding I came early to wait on her but was inform'd she was not come out of her Chamber therefore I resolv'd to take a Walk in the great Piazza of the City to give her time to dress her self but as I was going out I observ'd the Maid to my Mistress conferring with a Country Fellow the Sight of me I observ'd gave the Woman some Confusion My Heart told me I was concern'd in their Interview therefore I went to the Corner of the Street and waited till their Dialogue was over which did not keep me long for the Fellow soon parted with the Woman and went out of the Gate that leads to  Cordova  I had my Man with me whom I acquainted with my Fears ordering him to dog the Fellow and get out of him by fair Means or foul his Business at  Don Lewis  's House and I would follow after him on Horseback  Away ran my Man and I soon got my Horse and overtook 'em about a League and a half  from  Sevil  When my Man got Sight of me I observ'd he took a little Basket from the Countryman and ran away over the Fields with it I fancy'd by that he had succeeded in his Commission so turn'd my Horse and follow'd him  When I had overtaken him we went behind a Tuft of Trees a little out of the Road where he told me he had made the Fellow believe he was sent by  Teresa  the Name of the Maid he was conferring with to give him Notice that he would be pursu'd by a Cavalier and forc'd to deliver what he had receiv'd from her and perhaps be in Danger of losing his Life and that he had Orders to consult with him for his Safety  The Countryman being none of the wisest soon discovered the whole Affair to my Man and at Sight of me deliver'd the Basket to him and ran to a publick House in the next Village to wait till he could get clear of me where my Man was to bring him his Basket again In the Basket were four Melons and in one of them we found a Letter very artificially put up which I took out and with Terror of Mind read the Contents which were as follows  LIfe of my Life and Treasure of my Soul I receiv'd yours which gave me all the Consolation my disconsolate Heart was capable of receiving But the fatal Moment is approaching when I must give up this Body to another Person but without a Heart which always dwells with you and be assur'd unless ill Usage force it thence shall ever dwell in the Mansion of your Breast But my Soul grieve not for maugre my Tyrant Husband I will find Time to see the Darling of my Eyes and in the Pleasure of those dear Arms  forget the dull Embraces of a Husband Let Ten be the latest this Evening when you shall find at the usual Place with longexpecting Love your  Isabella  I was Thunderstruck at the reading of this Letter yet blest my providential Stars that guided me to this black Secret before the Priest had join'd our Hands And tho' a  Spaniard  my Resentment did not rise to Jealousy but my Fancy ran upon the Enjoyment of this false Fairone without the Marriage Chain And what prompted me the more to it was a Postscript to her Letter wherein she bad him come in his usual Disguise and in the dark In order to the Accomplishment of my Design I went into a neighbouring House and wrote the following Letter which was put in the Melon in the Room of the other  My Love  I  Have not Time to write my self I am so guarded by my Father and my Tyrant Husband that is to be so that I am oblig'd to employ  Teresa  Don't come to the usual Place till you hear from me which shall certainly be Tomorrow Adieu thou Life and Soul of  Isabella  Now all the Hopes I had were that the Fellow knew what Disguise this amorous Spark wore and where was the Place of Rendezvous  I left it all to my Servant who had Cunning enough to outwit twenty of the Countryman After I had deliver'd him his Commission I went back to  Sevil  full of Hopes and  Fears and in two Hours my Man arriv'd He gave me a Description of his Converse with the Countryman which was diverting enough and how happy they were in escaping my Hands  He inform'd me the amorous Gallant came disguis'd in the Habit of a Peasant and was admitted through the back Garden of  Don Lewis  's House by the Maid who always attended the Hour and convey'd him to her Apartment in the Dark which was according to my Wish and by Description of the Spark's Person we were not unlike as to Proportion or Age and Darkness would conceal the rest  I soon provided my self of the Habit I was to wear and impatiently expected the coming Hour which came at last though the intervening ones seem'd the longest of my Life  I did not wait long before I was admitted by the toofaithful Confident We went over the Garden to a small Room at the Entrance of the House where I soon discover'd my false Fairone tho' in the dark She was undress'd and disincumber'd of every Lett to Enjoyment I found by her eager Kisses and Embraces there was no Parlying requir'd so I e'en fell to and fed very heartily my Partner in Pleasure seem'd to like what was prepar'd for her and before we parted gave me to understand I had done Wonders and much beyond her Expectation  When we had dally'd away about four Hours in our Feasting the Maid came to tell me it was time to part which we did after snatching another Morsel  I went immediately home was soon in Bed and had no want of any Provocative to Sleep  When I arose in the Morning I began to weigh maturely the last Night's Adventure but could come to no Resolution as to the forming my Behaviour to my false Mistress But I resolv'd to be determin'd by hers  I went to visit her about Noon and found her more than ordinary civil to me  In short I was so charm'd with the Sight of her that I resolv'd to give her another Visit in my Disguise the same Night and all I had to do was to be first at the Place  When the Time came my Conductress was as ready as before but going softly in she clapt to the Door a little too hastily and fasten'd my Coat in't and to give me the more Uneasiness she the same Moment dropt the Key out of her Hand and though I could see where it lay yet I could not stoop for it because my Coat was secur'd in the Door  After groping about some time she took it up and open'd the Door to release her Prisoner But on the very Instant my Rival appear'd and finding himself there before he came rush'd in and fasten'd upon me  The Maid at the Sight of two  Sofia's  clapt to the Door in a Fright and ran screaming away so we had the Happiness to be lock'd in the Garden together But however to make the best of a bad Market as the Saying is I got my Rival down and belabour'd him with my Fists for as good Fortune would have it we had neither of us any offensive Weapons  The Noise of the Maid and our bustling alarm'd an  English  Mastiff that was Watchman to the House who without saying  By your Leave  had the Impudence to fasten upon my Rival by the Arm and worry'd him very handsomely But notwithstanding my Reasons to the  contrary I took Pity of him and by Force of Arms destroy'd the Dog that is I held him so fast about the Throat with my Hands that his last Breath flew away in a Huff  My disguis'd Spark seeing himself so unexpectedly reliev'd gave me Thanks for his Safety and assoon as ever he spoke for we had been sullen before neither of us having open'd our Lips I knew him by his Tongue to be one of my particular Acquaintance  Why how now  Don Juan  said I how came you thus disguis'd Nay reply'd the  Don  I ought to ask you the same thing With several Questions and Answers we came to a right Understanding If I had known said he your Pretensions here I should never have made any Attempts to your Prejudice Come come said I it's very well as it is So we turn'd that to Mirth and Ridicule which perhaps others of our Nation would have turn'd to Blood Our next thing was to make our Escape for the whole House was alarm'd and coming upon us with their domestick Weapons as Pokers Spits Fireshovels c My Companion led me to a Place of the Garden where the Wall was something lower than any where else and just as we had gain'd the Ascent we perceiv'd a Man mounting from the other Side but my Friend did him the Favour to tumble him down again he quickly got up and ran upon him most furiously with his Poniard and gave him several Stabs but my Friend clos'd with him wrested his Weapon from him and stabb'd him to the Heart  Assoon as he was sped we made off but did not go far before my Companion dropt down dead of his Wounds I was very much griev'd at the Accident but made the best of my way  home for fear I should come into Trouble about it if I was caught near the dead Bodies  I went to Bed but very much perplex'd in Mind and had no Rest all Night But what was my Grief in the Morning when my Servant brought me Word my Father and  Don Juan  my Friend were found murder'd in the Habits of Peasants under  Don Lewis  's GardenWall The Relation depriv'd me of the Use of Speech for some time and my Reason forsook me I was more than once going to put an End to my Life and had certainly done it if I had not been prevented by my faithful Servant But when my Reason return'd again I began to think of the Adventure with some Calmness for though I had all the Grief imaginable for the Loss of so good a Father yet I was of a Temper not to grieve long at any thing and then the Fortune I thought my self Master of appear'd so lovely to me that it soon dry'd up my Tears  The City imagin'd my Father came by his Death through  Don Lewis  's Means as remembring the antient Enmity of the two Houses and being found so near his House strengthen'd the Opinion of every Body and I was the only Person satisfy'd to the contrary  The Servants that brought in my Father's Body gave me several Papers found in his Pockets among which were two Letters that partly let me into the Truth of this unhappy Adventure The first was to this Purpose  SIR  YOur Generosity has prevail'd and I can no longer withst  nd your Offers on the Condition as you promise in your last that you will break off the  Match between your Son and my Lady You must provide your self of a Peasant's Habit and tomorrow I will send you a Note to instruct you farther  Yours c Teresa  The Second was as follows  BE at the West End of the Garden at one in the Morning and ascend a Ladder of Rope you will find there and bring it over with you near the Corner you'll perceive an Arbour go in there and wait till I come to conduct you to your Wishes I'll take care nothing shall be in your way to interrupt your Privacy and be sure you be careful of your Tongue for if you speak we shall be both undone  My Thoughts were in the utmost Confusion about the unravelling of this fatal Affair and running over in my Imagination my past Conversations with my Father I remember'd in our last he told me he thought it a little of the soonest for me to marry and that it would be more for my Interest to delay our Nuptials and perhaps said he I may give you sufficient Reasons for the contrary Whatever his Reasons were I little thought of the true one  I sent a Letter to the Maid of my false Mistress but she fearing she should be found out as she really was absconded  Don Lewis  sent to condole with me in my great Loss but I could perceive it gave him some Satisfaction that I was in actual Possession of that Estate which I had only Hopes of in the Life of my Father His Visit was but short yet I thought it too long for as I had no Design of  marrying the Daughter I was very willing to drop my Acquaintance with the Father Tho' I gave him Hopes when Decency would permit I would not fail in my Addresses to his Daughter  After the Interment of my Father I began to examine his Affairs and was not very well pleas'd to find the best Part of his Estate mortgag'd for twelve Years to several Persons and instead of seeing my self worth twenty thousand Crowns a Year soon found I was not worth the sixth Part  It was agreed that my Father was very profuse in his way of Living always keeping open House yet it was every body's Opinion he did not expend half his Income  I sometimes imagin'd there was some underhand Dealing in the Affair but it was past my finding out I therefore took an odd Resolution I determin'd with my self to undergo a voluntary Banishment till the term of Years on the Mortgage was expir'd  I made a Visit to  Don Lewis  and told him of my Resolves and my Reasons for it which he could not chuse but applaud for it was easy enough to perceive Interest was the Jack he aim'd at He did not press me to see his Daughter nor I him but after Assurance of remembrancing on both sides we parted  I must own my Soul long'd for another Taste of the delicious Banquet and I hope you will excuse me when I own to you my Passion could not be call'd Love but as I found it impracticable I made my self as easy as I could  In a few Weeks I had finish'd my Affairs and waited for the sailing of the  WestIndia  Fleet resolving for the City of  Mexico  where I had an Uncle very rich who had often express'd  in his Letters to my Father the great Desire he had to see me  I had rais'd out of the Ruins of my Father's Fortune six thousand Crowns without so much as touching any of his Plate or Furniture the care of those Things with all my Writings I trusted to a near Kinsman Superior of a Monastery in the City  One Day going about two Leagues out of Town my Horse's Girt broke which obliged me to a light at a Sadler's to have it made good The Man ask'd me if I would not take a walk in his Garden while he was doing his Work which I accordingly did  At the end of the Walk was a pretty Arbour and in it sat a Woman reading who at the Sight of me gave a great Shriek and was for running out but I stopp'd her and begging Pardon for disturbing her told her I would retire and leave her alone But upon finding it was  Teresa  Maid to my quondam Mistress I resolv'd to stay with her that I might know something of my Father's Affair  She appear'd confounded at the Sight of me is imagining I had come on purpose to apprehend her but I soon undeceiv'd her and with a little soothing Language and a couple of Pistoles she dispos'd her self to give me all the information she could  Sir said she I hope you will pardon me for what I did was purely by the Influence of Gold  Your Father declar'd to me at first Sight of my Mistress his Heart and Reason forsook him  nd often inform'd me if he could not enjoy  er he should be obliged to put an end to his Misery by Death I often lay'd before him the  njury he would do to you his Son but he as  often declar'd he would break off the Match between you for he was well assur'd you had no very violent Inclination for her and there were other Women in  Sevil  of as great a Fortune as my Mistress that would be proud of his Alliance  The many rich Presents he made me overcame my Honesty and that unfortunate Night that brought him his Death was to have compleated his Happiness But said she after some Pause I am very much at a loss to find out one thing What's that Madam said I Why Sir return'd  Madona  since I know how Matters stand between you and my Mistress I shall give you to understand that you were not the favour'd Lover and that another Gentleman revell'd in those Delights you perhaps thought to have the whole Possession of and that was the Reason I was so willing to comply with your Father for I had intended to introduce him in the Habit of the said Gentleman unknown to my Mistress and had provided a Story accordingly For assoon as ever the Gentleman was gone your Father should have taken his Place in the same Disguise and I intended to impose on my Mistress that her Lover was return'd to take another Farewel of her And this Cheat was easy to be carry'd on being they were obliged to Silence old  Don Louis  lodging in the next Room But what amazes me as I was saying opening the Door to let my Mistress's Lover in another in the same Disguise rush'd in upon me which I am sure was not your Father I soon clear'd up this Affair with her and let her know how I had supplanted my Rival  She seem'd very much surpriz'd at the unravelling of this Secret but was very glad she had nothing to apprehend from my Resentments being  that was the chief Cause of leaving her Mistress as imagining I should find the Letters she had sent him And upon this she resolv'd to go to her Mistress again for she heard every Day from the Family and knew how Matters stood and that her Mistress wanted her that they might condole together for the loss of  Don Juan  her old Spark But she declar'd she was not very sorry for his Loss for Mony came very hard from him and you know Sir said she it is our Business to make Hay while the Sun shines  Madam said I since I know what you love best if you'll pursue my Intrigue twenty Pistoles are at your Service Indeed Sir return'd Madam it must be something very extraordinary that I shall refuse for such a Sum Why then I'll let you into my Plot said I you shall inform your Mistress  Don Juan  is not Dead as was reported but after a tedious and dangerous Illness was recover'd to a Miracle but conceal'd his Revival being under some Apprehension of answering for the Life of my Father  Sir said she I like your Plot so well that I'll answer for the Success on't and I'll go about it instantly for I long to be fingering the Gold Why then said I you shall finger it beforehand and when the Business is done I'll double the Sum She was mightily pleas'd with the Amendment to the Bargain and the third Night after was concluded on for the Time when I was to attend as before  I took leave of  Teresa  and pursu'd my Journey made merry with my Friends and return'd  At length the happy Moment came that I so long expected My mercenary Confident was ready I enter'd and once more took Possession of all my Treasure and as I thought it would be the  last time was profuse enough My Lady seem'd very well pleas'd with my Night's Work and in plain Terms told me so  I had prepar'd a Letter in which I had disclos'd every thing When our loving Affair was over she ask'd me softly how I was engaged in that Adventure I told her as softly as I could that I knew she would be inquisitive and talking being dangerous I had brought the Account in Writing which I put into her Hand and with some regret took my Leave for the next Day was intended for our Imbarkation As I walk'd over the Garden I ask'd  Teresa  how long the Amour had been between  Don Juan  and her Lady she told me about two Years and this was the Commencement  Don Juan  whose Countryhouse lay about two Leagues from my Master's was set upon by Thieves and dangerously wounded and there had lost his Life if  Don Lewis  had not very fortunately for him come that Way attended and drove off the Thieves  Don Juan  was so very much hurt that it was not thought safe to carry him home therefore my Master order'd him to his House where his Wounds kept him a great while When he had recover'd Strength enough to walk he usually employ'd his time in the Garden where my Lady often seeing him fell desperately in Love with him She made me the Confident of her infant Passion and I being a very proper Person to be trusted with such Secrets advis'd her to let the  Don  see her which we contriv'd thus  She was to go into an Arbour at the farther end of the Garden where I had observ'd  Don Juan  sat every Day and pretend to be asleep She took all the care that was necessary in her Dress and did as I directed her It succeeded  to her Wish for the  Don  at Sight of her imagining her an earthly Goddess kneel'd and kiss'd her Hand She seem'd to wake in a pretended Fright but it was not long before they came to a right Understanding  That Place was made the Rendezvous of the Lovers when Opportunity would permit but he recovering tho' he pretended a Weakness for some time was obliged to take leave of our House tho' in the Father's Absence they often found Opportunity to satisfy their Loves and when they resided in Town he continu'd his Visits in the Disguise of the Countryman he us'd to send to my Lady with Presents of Fruit and by that means they received Letters from each other  When she had finish'd her short Relation I gave her the tewnty Pistoles I promis'd her and took my Leave She seem'd to be in some Confusion about managing it with her Mistress for she would certainly find her out she said when she would be confirm'd of  Don Juan  's Death but she comforted her self with telling me her Mistress durst not disclose it to any body for fear of betraying herself But poor  Teresa  little thought her Mistress would find it out so soon as the next Morning when she had read my Letter that I put into her Hand when I left her The next Day I order'd my Equipage on board our Ship which lay at  Cadiz  and follow'd my self but the Wind chopping about hinder'd our setting Sail I then repented the leaving my Letter with my Mistress for by the help of my Money with  Teresa  I might have made another Meal with her  I old not think it Prudence to go on Shore fearing her Resentments might form some Designs on my Life I therefore contented my self  on Board till the Wind should prove fair for sailing As I was reading in my Cabin one Day alone my Servant brought me a Letter The Contents were these  Noble Sir  UNderstanding you are bound for  Mexico  the Place of my Birth I shall think it the greatest Honour in the World if you please to take me into your Protection My Father was a rich Merchant of that City who going to another World has left me a considerable Estate in this Those Persons who had the care of my Education here seem to have Designs against my Fortune therefore I have made my Escape from 'em but must return to my Betrayers if you have not the Goodness to be my Guardian to  Mexico  where I shall return the Obligation you shall please to lay me under in being my Protector  I ask'd my Man who brought the Letter and he told me a young Negro I bid him bring him in I ask'd him several Questions and found him ready with his Answers He inform'd me that his Father tho' a Negro was a Man of Substance and had sent him in his Infancy to be educated at  Sevil  and for the rest the Letter inform'd me  I was mightily pleas'd with the Person of the black Gentleman and treated him civilly with the Assurance of delivering him safe to his Friends at  Mexico  When we were alone he told me he had a farther Secret to discover to me if he was sure of not being interrupted Upon hearing this I order'd my Servant on Shore for some Necessaries and inform'd him we need not fear any Interruption for some Hours  After a long Pause and casting his Eyes on the Ground he began  This Veil of Night would not hide my Blushes if I were not convinc'd in your Knowledge of my Frailty But if you'll consider my Youth Climate and Opportunity you will allow few of my Sex could withstand the Temptation Be not surpriz'd to find in this Disguise the Daughter of  Don Lewis  who is so far subject to the caprice of Love as to disclose to you the inmost Secret of her Heart  The Letter you left with me produc'd a contrary Effect than I believe you imagin'd and instead of Rage and Indignation taking Possession of my Breast a softer Passion stole in and I felt all the Tenderness imaginable for  Don Pedro  I expect nothing but ill Usage from you for my past Conduct but if you can believe there is any Sincerity in Woman after what I have been guilty of I am assur'd you may depend on what I say that no other Object shall share my Heart with you I do not mean the tye of Wedlock but if you will accept of me as I am I'll be as subservient to your Commands as your meanest Slave  I was so confounded between Pleasure and Amazement that I imagin'd all I heard and saw was a Dream but being sweetly convinc'd of the Reality I said all my Passion could suggest in return not giving my self time to consider of the Oddness of the Accident 'Twas sufficient I had in Possession all that was lovely in Woman in my Imagination and I had no other Thought but how to keep her from the Knowledge of her Father on Shore and the Sailors on Board for we did not know when we should set Sail  My Mistress told me if she had not succeeded with me she resolv'd for a Nunnery but since we were reconciled she had laid by all Thoughts of the Habit She made her Escape from her Father's without the Assistance or Knowledge of any one but  Teresa  But what favour'd her Escape was the Absence of her Father for ten Days in the Country yet she fear'd when he came home again he would fright  Teresa  into Consession or by Promises get it out of her for that she was mercenary enough to sell any thing she had to the best Bidder To prevent which we agreed to dress her in the Habit of a Man and let her wear her own Complexion  Accordingly we both went on Shore at  Cadiz  and soon equipt our selves with what we wanted and on Board I brought my Spark as a Relation of mine that had a Mind to run his Fortune with me The next Day the Wind proving favourable we set Sail and left our Apprehensions behind us  I was obliged to let our Servant into the Secret that I might have it kept so well knowing if he had discover'd it himself it had not been a Secret long tho' the Fellow was very faithful to any Secret that was trusted to him  We touch'd at the  Madera  Islands pass'd the Pike of  Teneriff  got over the Line duck'd our Men as usual and met with no extraordinary Accident but in fifty three Days arriv'd safe at the City of  Sancta Domingo  or St  Dominick  the capital City of the Island  Hispaniola  I was very well pleas'd to find so delightful a Place as this was after the Fatigue of our Voyage My Mistress and I took us a Lodging at a goodnatur'd  Spaniard  's that treated us very wellfor our Money  Here my Lady told me she felt the Effects of our Familiarity I endeavour'd to persuade her I had no Hand in't but she insisted upon't that the Deed was done by me and gave me some Proofs to believe it  I was very much concern'd to find Means to hide it from the House for she began to have those Qualms which attend that natural Distemper and by the Beauty of her Face I fear'd her Sex might soon be distinguish'd  I kept her from the Sight of our Ship's Crew in the Voyage she always staying in the Cabin and it was very dangerous to discover a fine Woman in this Part of the World because there are few that are handsome  I was upon Thorns till our Departure for  Mexico  but the Fleet staying longer than I expected I took a Ramble to the most noted Places in the Island and since I understand by your Story you never were there I'll give you a short Description of it  Hispaniola  is seated from seventeen Degrees to nineteen Degrees Latitude in Length about one hundred and twenty Leagues and Breadth about the middle Part fifty The Air much the same for Heat as at  Sevil  in  Spain  the Fruits delicious and some peculiar to the Place  The capital City is St  Domingo  which gives a delightful Prospect from the Fields about it being mix'd with pleasant Gardens and Rivers  Here the Governor of the Island resides and here are kept all their Offices and Courts of Judicature and it is likewise the Storehouse to the whole Island  There are two Cities more St  Jago  and  Nuestra Sennora de alta Gracia  the last of which  is to the South and is famous for the best Chocolate in the World  The Cathedral of St  Domingo  is a handsome Pile of Building and the other Churches are answerable to the Grandeur of the Inhabitants whose very Artizans are wealthy  The Fryers live as luxurious here as in any other Part of the World and follow the Steps of their Brethren in chusing the noblest Situations  This Island was discover'd by  Columbus  in the Year and kept in the Hands of the  Spaniards  ever since that Time while most of their other Acquisitions are fell to the  English French  and  Dutch  Tho' the  French  have some Plantations in the Island at present yet they were of their own acquiring and not taken from the  Spaniards  and being chiefly Hunters and not very rich the  Spaniards  make no Attempt upon 'em  No Island can boast of more convenient Ports than this and every Port disembogues fine Rivers stor'd with palatable Fish into the Sea but then to qualify that Blessing they are very much infested with Aligators and Crocodiles I saw one lying on the Shoreside like a Log of Wood and as a Buffalo came there to drink he sprung upon him dragg'd him to the Bottom and there devour'd him tho' they are easily to be avoided from the aromatic Smell that comes from their Skin  I was much surpriz'd to find in most Houses Serpents instead of Cats that were greater Enemies to Rats and Mice but what was more pleasing they were not the least Offensive having no Venom in 'em But then they will often play the Fox with the Poultry and destroy many of them unless narrowly watched  The  Scolopendria  of the  Greeks  is found here and very large Scorpions but by the Divine Providence neither of 'em hurtful  I shall not trouble you with any farther Account of this Island because there is not any thing to be found there but what is upon the Continent unless some particular Herbs and as I am no Botanist I shall not take any notice of 'em  The time came at last for our embarking for  Vera Cruz  in order to go to  Mexico  and I left St  Domingo  with some Regret as imagining I should not meet with any other Place in  America  so pleasant  During our Voyage my Mistress was mightily disorder'd  We embark'd for  Vera Cruz  where we arriv'd without any Accident and having no Business there we set out by Land for  Mexico  and got safe there But enquiring for my Uncle I was inform'd he was gone to reside at  Lima  the capital City of  Peru  My Concern was the more in that I fear'd I should not meet with proper Accommodation at  Mexico  for want of him in the Affair of my Mistress for her Condition would not bear the Fatigue of another Removal  I was entertain'd in the House of a near Friend of my Uncle's and one who kept a Correspondence with him he was very civil to me and of a freer Disposition than generally the  Spaniards  are but he had the same Vanity as all the old Christians have who Pride themselves very much upon't I let him into the Secret of my Lady and her Condition and by the help of his Wife we made her reassume her proper Dress But we kept her private  The time of her Delivery came and the Product prov'd a lusty Boy who staid among us three  Weeks and then left us I had no Scruples about being the Father for it was plain enough to be seen it being my Picture in a little My Mistress continu'd very weak longer than the usual Time and I being alone with her one Day she told me she was under some Apprehensions concerning our Landlord Don  Manuel  who had made her secretly many large Offers and the Nurse was his Emissary I told her I had the same Proposals from his Wife and tho' the Woman was not disagreeable nay might pass for a Beauty where Women were so scarce yet I could not find any Tenderness for her in my Heart  After many Arguments between us a Thought came into my Head which I hop'd would produce some Mirth among us I desir'd my Mistress to give Don  Manuel  some small Encouragement and leave the rest to me  My Landlord soon found an Opportunity thro' my means to see my Mistress She follow'd my Advice and transported the  Don  out of his Senses his Joy was not to be contain'd he forgot the Gravity of a  Spaniard  and caper'd about like a  French  Dancingmaster When I learnt all their Discourse from my Mistress I begg'd her to continue her good Humour to him and promise him a meeting that Day Sevennight in the Summerhouse of the Garden She did as I directed  In the mean time I took my Opportunity to confabulate with the Wife and gave her Directions the Night appointed to go to the same Summerhouse but to avoid Speech being it was over the Water and Men were continually passing to and fro The good Woman was as much overjoy'd as her Husband and the better to carry on my Design I gave it out that I was  to go with some Gentlemen a hunting the Buffalo for two or three Days I desir'd my Landlord a Title I had given him out of Mirth to take care of my Wife in my Absence I told my good Landlady this was a Contrivance of mine that we might not be suspected  My Mistress had made just the same Agreement with the  Don  The Time came and the good Man and good Woman were left to worry one another with their extraordinary Passion  The next Day at Dinner for we generally eat together Don  Manuel  cast many a Sheep's Eye at my Wife and his good Lady at me  The same Day as I was reading in the Garden  Madona  came to me and in bitter terms of Reproach gave me much ill Language and told me I had betray'd her to her Husband basely by giving him the Ring she gave me the last Night I soon found that she had made a Present to her Husband of a Ring taking him for me and she had observ'd it upon his Finger She made so many Speeches about it that at last I was compell'd to tell her the whole Truth to get rid of her tiresome Passion but I soon repented of my Declaration for she flew upon me and with her Nails play'd the Cat with my Face and I had much ado to disengage my self from her So furious does a disappointed Passion make a Woman  Her confounded Temper made me resolve to leave  Mexico  The Husband began to suspect something of the Affair but his Imagination that he had the Company of my Wise in the Summerhouse curb'd his Resentment  The Woman's Rage was unsurmountable and it was not in my Power to bring her to Temper Therefore I chose to avoid her as much as possible  As I was at Supper with my Mistress some few Days after the Accident happen'd she told me she had receiv'd a Present of Cordialwater from Don  Manuel  's Wife Now I had not told her of  Madona  's Resentment because I imagin'd it might make her uneasy But assoon as I heard of the Present something struck my Mind there was something uncommon in it I therefore desir'd my Mistress not to drink any of it Lord said she my Dear I have already and desire you would taste it too for 'tis the pleasantest Liquor I ever drank in my Life  I was mightily disturb'd at it and two Hours discover'd the fatal Effects  My Mistress began to be very much out of order and notwithstanding all the Aid of Physicians she expir'd in my Arms and every body agreed she had been poison'd I had in my Fury and Ravings declar'd to Don  Manuel  the Author of this black Deed and when he went to enquire after her was inform'd she went out before Night and was suppos'd to have gone to the Town of St  Jago  on the Lake to one of her Relations Don  Manuel  sent after her but she was not to be found He grieved at the loss of my Mistress as much as I did and I dare avow if he had found his Wife he would have sacrific'd her to the  Manes  of my dear Mistress  I was very much griev'd for the Loss of my Mistress for I had reason to be convinc'd her Passion for me was unfeign'd You may easily imagine there was no staying for me in the House where this dismal Accident happen'd but as I was preparing to be gone the  Corrigidore  sent for me to appear before him to give him the best Account I could of this Action I related to him the whole Truth as I have told it  you only I declar'd it was my Wife I had lost Don  Manuel  was seiz'd and put in Prison notwithstanding I insisted upon his Innocency but he proceeded in that manner being it was suppos'd he was accessary to his Wife's Escape But a few Days after he was secur'd News was brought that his Wife was found murder'd in the Woods as it was suppos'd by some  Indians  as she was endeavouring to make her Escape from the Hands of Justice  Thus she met her Reward for her barbarous Murder of a Woman that never wrong'd her tho' indeed the Favour was design'd for me  A few Days after this fatal Accident I heard of some Merchants that design'd to cross the Continent to the  South Sea  with a good Guard I made Acquaintance with 'em paid my Quota to the Charge and set out along with 'em leaving behind me the hateful City of  Mexico  where I had lost the only thing I esteem'd on Earth And I must own to you notwithstanding my Philosophy I never thought of her for some time without the utmost Heartbreaking I have endeavour'd indeed by forcing my Temper to Mirth to bury the Remembrance and Time with good Company has brought me some Assistance yet nevertheless I do firmly believe no Woman's Charms will ever for the future break my Rest for I am satisfy'd my late Mistress made a Hole quite through my Heart  But to pursue my Discourse  We set out with a Guard of fifty  Spanish  Soldiers for fear of the  Indians  who had made it their daily Practice to set upon every body that went through the Country if not too strong for 'em I need not tell you that  Mexico  is one of the finest Cities in the World or that it lies  upon a Lake and no other Passage to it but over three broad Causways from different Cities on the Land But what is something extraordinary one part of the Lake is brackish and noisome with no living Creature in't and the other is fresh wholsome and stor'd with palatable Fish But as there are many exact Accounts of the Continent of  America  and its Conquest by my noble Countryman  Hernando Cortes  I shall say no more of it but I will take the Liberty to add that  Caesar▪  and  Alexander  were but Pigmy Conquerors to him and every body will be of that Opinion if they will give themselves the Trouble of reading his History  We met with no  Indians  to oppose our Passage and arriv'd at  Segovia  an inland Town inviron'd with Rocks and but meanly built Some of our Company staid there and I was willing to stay along with 'em to refresh my self for it's but indifferent travelling over rocky Mountains and crossing Rivers upon Hurdles that is Pieces of Timber lash'd together with Ropes and it is sometimes dangerous tho' we got over safe with our whole Company  I staid fifteen Days at  Segovia  with fifteen of my Companions I was very much surpriz'd at the Relation of some of the Inhabitants of that Place who told me about two hundred of your Countrymen the Year before Freebooters in spight of all Opposition came from the  South Sea  to the  North  with a very great Booty defeated the  Spaniards  when ten to one and posted to all the Advantage in the World several times The People of  Segovia  talk of 'em as so many Devils and that they were aided by the black Gentleman or it had been an Impossibility to have gone through what they did But  it must be confess'd your Countrymen despise Hazards and laugh at the greatest Dangers  After we had sufficiently refresh'd our selves we took our Leaves of  Segovia  and pursu'd our Journey to the  SouthSea  with a Guard of  Indians  subservient to the  Spaniards  And I must own to you there is not a People in the World more true to their Trust than those confederate  Indians  that own the Dominion of  Spain  Our Journey to St  Fee  was pleasant enough through a rich level pleasant Country and we rode upon Mules a Beast of a sure Foot and our chief Diversion was shooting of Monkies that play'd us several comical Tricks running up the Trees and frequently did us the Favour to urine in our Faces and sometimes something worse  When we arriv'd at St  Fee  a small Town and Port in the  SouthSea  we had the good Fortune of meeting with a Vessel ready to set Sail for  Lima  We went immediately on Board and got clear of the Shore that Evening  We arriv'd at  Lima  after a Voyage of twenty five Days we landed at  Calao  the Port that all the Ships of  Spain  anchor at and one of the finest in the  SouthSea  The Town is built upon a Point of Land that runs into the Sea It is very strongly fortify'd and well garrison'd I sent my Servant to my Uncle at  Lima  to acquaint him that I was coming to wait on him the next Day but my Servant return'd in four Hours with my Uncle's Coach who inform'd me that he was impatient till he saw me My Uncle was Judge of the Civil Courts and a Man in very great Power He sent his  Major Domo  to wait on me with his Excuse that he had come himself but that he was afflicted with the Gout I only staid  till I had put on other Cloaths and immediately after went in the Coach with the  Major Domo  and arriv'd at my Uncle's just within Night He was very well pleas'd to see me and caress'd me in an extraordinary manner But I was something surpriz'd to find that he had resolv'd for  Spain  within a Month there to end his Days  I told him the Story of my Father's unhappy Fate only concealing his Love to  Donna Elvira  He was very much shock'd at the News owning to me his chief Reason of going to  Spain  was to have the Happiness of living together I then told him I suppos'd as that could not be that he would alter his Resolution and think no more of his Voyage But he answer'd most of his Effects were gone for  Spain  two Months before and that he must of necessity follow  I gave him to understand that it was not in my Power to wait upon him He took a great deal of Pains to persuade me to it but when he found it was to no purpose he told me since I was not to be prevail'd upon he would leave me Master of a small Fortune in  Lima  During his Stay he introduc'd me to most of the best Families in the City and the Viceroy was pleas'd to show me good Countenance and promis'd my Uncle to provide for me  When the time came of his embarking for  Spain  I waited on him on Board where we took Leave though not with dry Eyes and I have repented many times that I did not accompany him But we must submit to Fate and what is allotted us by Fortune will come  He left me Master of a wellfurnish'd House and a Plantation whose Income would provide  every thing Necessity requir'd in the middle Station of Life with a Promise that at his Death I should inherit the Remainder of his Estate for he was a single Man and had no nearer Relation than my self  I took all the Pleasure the Place would afford and to say Truth there was no want of any thing at  Lima  except the Conversation of the Female Sex though I must freely confess I did not always want that  The Viceroy prov'd very kind to me but Death taking him away suddenly I mightily griev'd his Loss as indeed I had Reason for the Person that succeeded him prov'd the Reverse He made a general Remove of all the Officers the Deceas'd had put in Posts and among the rest I was one of the Sufferers and farther upon all Occasions he made it his Business to slight me and often affronted me so grosly that nothing but his Dignity shrouded him from my Resentment and many other People in Power as the Injudicious generally copy the Frailties of their Superiors and neglect their Virtues treated me in the same Manner but I was resolv'd not to bear it  One Day as I was coming from my Plantation upon my Mule attended only with my old Servant I met a Nephew of the Viceroy's in his Chaise in a narrow Road and not being willing to give way to him we were both at a Stand which so enrag'd the cholerick Gentleman that he flew out of his Vehicle and ran his Spado into the Belly of my Mule which dropt down dead  I did not want so much Provocation to raise my Choler therefore I drew upon him and left him in the same Condition with my Beast grov'ling upon the Sand He had several People  that attended him who rush'd upon me and my Man overpower'd us and dragg'd us immediately to the Viceroy's Palace who being glad of any Pretence to wreak his Illnature upon me condemn'd me to  Baldivia  for Life in spite of the Intercession of those few Friends I had  It was in vain to complain of this damn'd Trick of Fortune and the more to plague me he left Orders that I should be dispos'd of to  Don Sancho Ramires  a Relation of his the Wretch that I have sufficiently reveng'd my self of and in part of the inhumane Viceroy for they were Partners in Trade  Ramires  us'd to put me upon the most slavish Business but as I had Money I usually bought it off for I receiv'd yearly my small Estate from  Lima  I mean from my Plantation for the Viceroy had seiz'd all the rest of my Moveables and would have done this but that the honest  Indian  who had the occupying of it insisted on its being my Uncle's  This old Hunks had a beautiful Daughter that I found was in Love with a Colonel of the Garrison of  Baldivia  This Colonel notwithstanding my Condition was not asham'd of my Acquaintance and often told me the Torments he endur'd for the young Lady  I ask'd him if the Lady knew of his Passion he inform'd me that he flatter'd himself with the Return though they had never spoke to each other but he had receiv'd obliging Glances from her fair Eyes from the Gallery which overlook'd the Court of Guard  I agreed that if he would write a Letter I'd pawn my Life she should have it and an Answer into the Bargain if she had any Inclination to send one He embrac'd me and thank'd  me for my kind Proffer and wrote a passionate Letter to the Lady which I accompanied with another to let her know I was devoted to her Service upon the Colonel's Account  In two Days I had an Answer convey'd into a hollow Tree in the Garden as I had concerted in my Note to her that waited upon the Colonel's  These Paper Messengers brought Matters to bear and the kind Lady resolv'd to venture her self with the Colonel  We contriv'd a Ladder of Ropes long enough to reach from her Window to the Terras on the Court of Guard and I convey'd a small Bundle of Packthread for her to throw down which we fasten'd to the Ladder of Ropes and the Lady with much Difficulty pull'd it up and fasten'd to an Iron Chest which was in the Room But as she came trembling for Fear down the Ladder it drew the Chest along the Floor above which awaken'd that old Devil her Father He immediately alarm'd all the Servants as well as Slaves but the Captain had got safe off with his Mistress  When old Huncks had summon'd us all together he went into the Room to see what the Matter was but when he found his Money safe his Distraction began to abate I must own I wish'd heartily we could have clear'd his Money too as well as his Daughter It was some time ere he miss'd her as having no Notion of her Elopement but when he found she was gone his Passion was unsurmountable for the good Lady had made bold with Writings of an Estate that it seems were left her by an old Aunt and I was very well pleas'd she did not go emptyhanded to my Colonel for I take Money to be the Sinews of Love as well as War  The inrag'd  Don  ran up and down like a Madman with about a dozen of us at his Heels and as we approach'd the Ditch of the Castle which happen'd to be free from Water being the Tide was out but pretty well provided with Mud some of his Servants imagin'd they saw something lie on the Mud The old  Don  being very peery was stooping down and gazing to be satisfy'd and the Devil prompting me just at the same time I clapt my Knee into his Bum and down fell the poor  Don  into the Mud  I was the first that cry'd out for Help yet I did not make extraordinary Haste to assist him but at last Ropes were brought and after he had flounder'd about a Quarter of an Hour we lugg'd him up in a sweet Pickle  By good Luck he did not mistrust that the Favour was design'd him but purely accidental I had an Opportunity the next Day to find out the Lady and the happy Colonel who had brought a Commission from the Priest to go to Bed together He was so well pleas'd with my Service that he promis'd to ransom me from  Don Sancho  and did not doubt but he should succeed being the  Don  made Money his  Summum Bonum  But we were surpriz'd at the Refusal for he had such a strict Charge from the Viceroy of  Peru  to hold me fast that it was more his Interest to keep me than part with me Nay this Proposal open'd the old  Don  's Eyes for he saw plainly I was at Bottom of his Daughter's Affair This so enrag'd him that he order'd a great wooden Clog to be lock'd fast to my Leg which I was oblig'd to lug along with me  This Proceeding drove me almost to Despair and I lost all Hopes of ever procuring my Liberty  The Colonel and his Lady who had recover'd the Fortune from  Don Sancho  were very much griev'd at my ill Usage and try'd all manner of Means for my Liberty but to no purpose I past three Years in this uncomfortable Life and had the Pleasure to hear that my implacable Enemy the Viceroy of  Peru  was summon'd to  Spain  upon the Account of some MaleAdministration At the hearing of this News my Hope of Freedom began to revive but it was soon clouded again for the old Devil  Don Sancho  was resolv'd to keep me a Martyr to his own Revenge and I weather'd out two Years more in my wretched Confinement Though Thanks to Heaven nothing depress'd my Spirits quite  The Colonel got an Opportunity to tell me that there was a Vessel in the Road bound for  Lima  and the Captain being a very good Friend of his he had prevailed with him to take me on Board him if it was possible for me to get out of Hunks's Clutches  I made all the Efforts imaginable but to no purpose and I was once more in my Imagination given up to eternal Slavery  The same Night as I was endeavouring to compose my troubled Thoughts I heard a great Noise in the CastleYard and was very much surpriz'd a while after when I saw an Officer and a File of Soldiers come to seize me as a Plotter against the State and carry'd me to the Colonel's Lodging But my Surprize was turn'd into Joy when I found he had us'd this Stratagem to gain me my Freedom I told him he had trebly repaid the Obligation he was pleas'd to say he lay under to me and I was resolv'd not to accept of my Liberty till I found what Stir  Don Sancho  made about it but the  Colonel resolv'd me that he had the Means in his own Hands to pacify him  I went on Board and set Sail the same Evening We had but an indifferent Voyage being involv'd in many Storms yet at last we arriv'd safe at  Calao  I shall if you think fit give you a short Description of  Baldivia  because few Foreigners are permitted to enter their Port  Baldivia  or  Valdivia  takes its Name from the first Founder a  Spaniard  The old Town stood a little higher than the new one till it was destroy'd by the  Indians  For  Peter Baldivia  and the rest of the  Spaniards  were such Tyrants over the poor Natives that they took Heart laid an Ambush for 'em and destroy'd 'em every one But in the new Town they are sufficiently guarded from their Insults or Danger of a foreign Enemy which have often attempted 'em to no Purpose This being reckon'd the richest Country for Gold Mines in all  America  Nature has befriended 'em very much in the Strength of the Place for there is so large a SandBank in the Mouth of the Bay that Vessels are obliged to come within five hundred Yards of the Shore which is guarded by a strong Castle to avoid it It is a difficult Harbour to enter but when you are once at Anchor no Wind on the whole Compass can hurt you tho' it blew a Storm it is so well shelter'd by the Land on all Sides of it  The Inhabitants are chiefly made up of banish'd Persons who generally work in the Mines for so many Years and the Time expir'd they have so much Land of their own to cultivate and most of them find the Means to be rich but how honestly I'll give you leave to judge The Country about it is very fruitful and  produces great Quantities of Apple Trees from which they make very good Cyder But the Juice of the Grape is very uncomatible there and those that do procure it must pay extravagantly for it  This City for it's no less is esteem'd the Key to the  SouthSea  The Governour and Officers are generally sent from  Lima  but the Soldiers are compos'd of those Persons that are sent there for a Punishment And tho' few Persons chuse to be sent there yet as few desire to leave it when once they are settled  Notwithstanding the People could make shift to live without Religion yet there are seven Churches and three Monasteries but they seem to be in a ruinated Condition And I don't doubt but an Age or two hence those that pass that Way may find them totally ruined  As I said we arriv'd safe at the Port of  Calao  I was resolv'd to remain  incognito  till I had enquir'd into the Affairs of the City  I took an Occasion to send to my  Indian  Tenant who came to me and was very well pleas'd to find me at Liberty  I sent him to several of my Friends to acquaint them what Circumstance I lay under who soon inform'd the Viceroy of my Misfortune and he as readily comply'd with my Desire allowing me the Liberty I had enjoy'd before I was sent to  Baldivia  I once more made my Appearance at  Lima  renew'd my Acquaintance and began to divert my self as before By degrees I crept into the good Graces of the Viceroy who gave me a Post in the Government that brought me a considerable Income and with the Esteem of most People I past on a whole Year  The Viceroy not liking his Situation found the Means to be recall'd to  Spain  Yet recommending me to his Successor I remain'd in the same Station he before had given me though I cannot brag of any more Favours bestow'd on me by my new Superior for he was a Man of an uncertain Temper proud and revengeful He was newly marry'd to a very rich Widow of  Lima  who had a very beautiful Daughter by Report for she was not suffer'd to take the Liberties of the Place  I often had a great Desire to see her Face for I had observ'd her veil'd many times at Church which was all the Liberty she had I was in form'd she was design'd a Wife for the  Supreme Judge  though much against her Inclination being there was a Disparity of Years which is certainly the greatest Bitter to the Sweets of Matrimony but nothing is consulted now more than Wealth  I receiv'd a Letter from my Uncle at  Sevil  wherein he desir'd I would leave  Lima  and come to  Spain  And to induce me to it he gave me the Promise to make me his Heir I must own I began to be pretty well tir'd of this Climate and the Time drawing on for the Expiration of my Mortgage I set my self to prepare things accordingly  I dispos'd of my Plantation to my faithful  Indian  for an under Price being I thought I was under many Obligations to him I resign'd up my Office in the Viceroy's Palace indeed because I could not get Leave to dispose of it  I turn'd all my Effects into GoldDust and sent it before me to my Uncle and now I only waited for Company to go over Land to  Vera Cruz  a Port in the North Sea where I should have Convenience of imbarking for  Spain  I began now to think of settling in the World and indeed it was almost time for I had past my twentyeighth Year and at that Age the Heat of Youth should be pretty well over for if a Man cannot see his Follies on this side thirty he is in Danger of being incorrigible all the Days of his Life Beside I had very good Encouragement to Stability my own Fortune and the Prospect of my Uncle's who in all Probability had not many Years to live being in his eightythird Year  Well then as my Story is almost off the Stage I'll throw you into the Bargain a short Account of one Place more for my Catastrophe and then to my Epilogue for detaining you so long and that shall be the Description of  Lima  as it is at present  Lima  the Capital City of  Peru  is seated about two Leagues from the SeaPort of  Callao  in Degrees Minutes of Southern Latitude and Degrees Minutes of Western Longitude It is built in a noble Plain with Hills at a Distance  Francis Pizarro  was the Founder in the Year tho' it has chang'd its Name since his Time from  La Ciudad de los Reges  or  City of Kings  to  Lima  which is only a Corruption of the  Indian  Word  Rimac  which was the Name of an  Indian  Idol formerly worship'd in that Place  This is the finest City next to  Mexico  in all  America  All the Streets are in a direct Line exactly measur'd out and much of the same Length and Breadth being fifty Yards wide  In the Heart of the City is the noblest Square my Eyes ever beheld and in the midst a Fountain of Brass adorn'd with eight Lions continually spouting Water supply'd by the River  of  Lima  that runs through the Skirts of the Town cover'd with a handsome Stone Bridge that leads to the Suburbs Within the Suburbs is a fine publick Walk beautify'd with Orange Trees and in the Evening is crowded with the best Company of the City Although this City is so beautiful it was mostly destroy'd by an Earthquake in the Year There are no less than fiftyseven Churches and Chappels with those that are in the Monasteries in this City and twentyfour Monasteries for Men and twelve for Women The Cathedral is very magnificent as are most of the other Churches tho' chiefly built with Wood from the first Story by reason of the Earthquakes  The Viceroy of  Peru  has his Residence here and is so powerful he hardly owns the King his Master to be his Superior Here are likewise kept all the Courts of Justice and from the High Court there is no Appeal Among the rest they have settled an  Inquisition  which on my Conscience is worse than that of  Spain  Heaven keep every Body from it for in this Court the Informant is a Witness and the Accuser is ever behind the Curtain and to mend the Matter the Witnesses are never brought Face to Face  To compleat the Grandeur of the Place there is an Archbishoprick and an University of three wellfill'd Colleges tho' the Students don't always follow Learning for I have found some ignorant enough  There are twelve Hospitals and one of them for  Indians  This City is garrison'd with two thousand Horse and six thousand Foot but very indifferent Troops for Service against a foreign Foe being chiefly compos'd of  Creolians  and  Indians  These  Creolians  who are so nam'd from owing  their Birth to  America  are most of 'em proud lazy and ignorant and generally Tyrants whenever they have Power tho' sharp enough as to Trade and will overreach you if they can  They are all inclin'd to Venery and will sacrifice every thing to gratify that Vice The Women who are really very handsome generally sit at home all Day crossleg'd and as mute as Fishes but at Night it is customary for 'em to haunt the Streets veil'd and will as hardly be refus'd a Favour as the Men with us on the like Occasion  As I was sitting one Evening in my Lodging dispatching some Letters for  Spain  I heard some body knock softly at my Door My Servant was gone abroad and therefore I arose and open'd it my self but was surpriz'd to see a Lady veil'd who without making any Words came in and sat down on a Couch After she had repos'd her self some time she unveil'd and discover'd to me one of the sweetest Faces I had ever seen I was almost turn'd into Stone at the Sight of so much Beauty and was ready to fall down to worship her as a Divinity Said she I come not here to be gaz'd at I like you and if you can do the same by me I believe you will not use me ill  Madam I return'd I know no other way to convince you that I like you but one With that I took her into an Alcove where we soon came to a right Understanding Assoon as our small Matter of Business was over she desir'd to be dismiss'd yet with a Promise to give me another Visit the next Evening but said she if you should chance by any Accident to see me in any other Place take your Eyes from the Object for fear of Danger for those Messengers of the Soul often betray their Trust  I promis'd to observe her Directions and left her but yet could not help my Curiosity for when she was got down Stairs I put on my Cloak follow'd her and observ'd she want into the Viceroy's Palace I was convinc'd by the Dress she wore that she was none of the common Sort and much diverted I was at the Accident  The next Day she did me the Favour of another Visit when we pass'd our time as pleasantly as we could and my  Incognita  seem'd very much pleas'd with my Company  After our Toying was over she told me she was afraid of losing me for she had heard I design'd for  Spain  I inform'd her nothing had Power to stop me but the Passion I had for her  She at last discover'd herself to me She was DaughterinLaw to the Viceroy She told me that she had respected me a great while and had many Disputes with her Honour and Love but the former was forc'd to give way to the latter She likewise let me know of her approaching Marriage and added that the Knowledge of my Person would make her Aversion to her Husband the stronger We had many Meetings to the Content of us both and she made me several Presents of Jewels which I intend to keep for her sake having preserv'd them thro' all my Fortunes Our Meetings now began to be less frequent being the WeddingDay was fix'd which gave me a great deal of Uneasiness To divert my Melancholy I usually took a Walk in the OrangeGrove where in my musing Fits I often stay'd longer than usual  As I was going home one Evening I heard the Clashing of Swords at a Distance and immediately after saw a Person running towards  me who cry'd For the Virgin  Mary  's sake if you are a Gentleman lend me your Sword to defend my self against a Villain who has offer'd me the vilest indignity I made him no Answer but gave him my Sword for he look'd like a Man of Quality and follow'd him  Just as I turn'd the Corner I saw him engag'd and his Antagonist drop down dead  The Gentleman seeing that took to his Heels  The Street being alarm'd with the Bustle as I came near the Body I was seiz'd as the Murderer What strengthen'd their Opinion and I must confess had but an indifferent Look was my Sword remaining in the Body of the Deceas'd All my Asseverations of Innocence signify'd nothing I was carried before the  Corrigidore  but having no Witnesses of my assaulting him and one Fellow by good Fortune proving I was not the Person that engag'd him first I was only once more condemn'd to  Baldivia  I curs'd my hard Stars a thousand times and the Grief of parting from my Mistress was like to rid me of Life but Time began to wear it off  I was secured in the Castle of the City till the Vessel was ready to sail  While I was confin'd in order to be transported to  Baldivia  a Gentleman came into the Prison and begg'd half an Hour's Conversation with me I had been so liberal to the Keeper with my Money and pretty jovial in my Humour that I believe if I had ask'd him to let me go he would not have deney'd me so that I begg'd the Favour to admit the Gentleman and his Absence during our Confabulation He obey'd me in both and the Gentleman enter'd my Room which though but mean was the best in the Prison  Assoon as the Gentleman had repos'd himself upon a Chair none of the best he ask'd me if I would please to refresh my self with any thing the Place afforded But I answering in the negative he made half a dozen Humms and Haws and open'd his Mouth to utter Sense  Sir said he you see before you the unhappy Person that is the occasion of your Confinement I should not be thus free with you if I were not assur'd of your generous Goodnature Once more I must tell you you see before you the unhappy Man who is guilty of that Fact you are to suffer for I am a Gentleman by Birth and tho' I had not the good Fortune to owe my first Being to old  Spain  yet I have this for my Consolation that my Parents were born at  Cordova  there but the Frowns of Fortune driving them to this part of the World grew asham'd of her ill Looks and greeted 'em with Smiles of Favour In a few Years  Plutus  the God of Wealth made 'em a Visit and took his Leave of 'em with a Promise of his frequent Return and he prov'd as good as his Word for in a little time Fortune became a neuter Gender that is believing they did not want her Assistance they were no more her Devotees  Sir said I the sooner you will please to come to plain  Spanish  the sooner I shall be in the ready Road to your Business  Why then said he not to keep you in Suspence I am the Person that was oblig'd to you for your Sword on such a Time which prov'd the Instrument of my Revenge on a base Wretch that deserv'd an Eternity of Torments after this Life for wronging the best of Women And since I find you love the shortest way without the tedious outward Flourishes of Rhetorick I  will inform you of my Story with as much Brevity as I am capable of  My Mother dy'd about seven Years since and I may very justly say the rest of my Father's Life was a Delirium but Death taking Pity of his Griefs came to his Aid and about two Years ago I was left Master of a plentiful Fortune  As Death is the End of all things and Age must pay its Tribute to him I shook off my Grief for my Father's Loss and in six Months after his decease fell in Love with a young Lady of an incomparable Beauty at least in my Eye My Fortune gave me easy Access to the Father of my Fair and when I had the Happiness of conversing with the Object of my Wishes she did not seem averse to my Passion Every thing concurring to my Desires  Hymen  join'd those Hands whose Hearts were united before  For several Days we revell'd in the Sweets of Love and I may justly say Possession had not the Power to pall Desire each Moment of Enjoyment seem'd new and my utmost Wish was center'd in her Breast But the dire Fiend tormenting Jealousy at last crept in and pall'd my Appetite to ardent Love the fatal Bitter to our mutual Sweets  I had a Person that I call'd my Friend who shar'd the Affluence of Fortune with me We had the same Desire to Love and Hate I therefore thought I was but poorly blest till my Friend saw the Idol of my Soul But oh what Pangs that fatal Moment cost me His Eyes receiv'd the Bane to all his Peace and in one Moment render'd up his Heart I gave him Leave for what could I refuse to such a Friend to visit my Wife when Business demanded my  Absence He often declared his Passion to her by plaintive Sighs and languishing Looks When my Wife perceiv'd he importun'd her too far with his Love she threaten'd to tell me of it but in the mean time he had acquainted me with what had pass'd between him and my Wife Said he My Friend I imagin'd your Wife was like other Women prone to change therefore in your Absence I counterfeited a Passion for her to see whether she had that Regard she ought to have for you and I am pleas'd to find you have made so worthy a Choice  I must own to you I was mightily pleas'd with this Tryal of my Friend as believing it sprang from his Kindness to me and I had much to do to reconcile my Wife to his Visits▪ She would often say I wish your Friend be sincere in his Professions to you for my part I greatly doubt it  In a little time after this Accident I perceiv'd my Friend began to look very melancholy I endeavour'd to sift the Secret from him but to no manner of Purpose for some time  One Day as we were riding out to take the Air together he seem'd more deeply plung'd in Sorrow than usual I told him I should not take him for my Friend any longer if he did not let me into the Cause of his Disorder At last with much Reluctance he told me that the good Opinion he had before conceiv'd of my Wife was false for he was well assur'd she was not true to my Bed  You must imagine what a Thunderclap this must be to me from a Friend who I was assur'd in my self would not relate a Falsehood It was some Moments before I could open my Mouth and all the time of my Silence he seem'd so much griev'd that he had declar'd the Secret to  me that I had no Doubt of the Truth of it  When my Grief had given me Liberty of Speech I begg'd he would give me the Foundation of his Suspicion but he desir'd to be excus'd till he had certain Proof of her Infidelity which he did not doubt but he should soon have tho' it was what he wish'd to be deceiv'd in And farther added he would not have me take any Notice of it but carry it fair to her as if nothing had happen'd for if you should said he you'll never come to the truth of the Matter  I promis'd to comply with him and went home but Heaven knows with what a Heart  I follow'd my Friend's Advice punctually but yet could not help showing the Discontent of my Mind in my Countenance My Wife was mightily concern'd for my Melancholy and was very pressing to know the Cause and in a very tender manner seem'd to be disquieted which I took all for Art and the Cunning of her Sex  I must own to you that sometimes I imagin'd my Friend had deceiv'd me but whenever we had an Opportunity of conversing he strengthen'd my Jealousy to such a degree that I began to wish the Cause of it no longer in this World And if it had not been for my revenging my self on the suppos'd Partner of her Guilt I had certainly taken Methods to dispatch her hence  I had some Affairs to transact at  Segovia  every Year and the time drawing on for my Journey my Friend told me before my Return I should have Demonstration of her Infidelity for said he your Absence will give her the Opportunity she wants and she'll be sure to take hold of it  It was a great while before I could be prevail'd upon by my Friend to undertake really this Journey but only to feign as if I had that I might be convinc'd of her Perfidy and punish it my self but my Friend laid me down so many Reasons for it that I at last very unwillingly agreed to go But in the mean time said he you must order that I may have Admittance in your Absence that I may take my Opportunity to observe all Passages Why said I I never knew you debarr'd the Liberty of my House But you know said he since my false Declaration of Love to try your Wife's Virtue she has look'd upon me more like an Enemy than Friend as knowing I was not sincere in my Passion for Women be they ever so vicious yet they abhor the Man that doubts their Virtue Well then said I if you will we'll sup together tonight and then I'll take an Opportunity to leave Directions with my faithless Wife to allow you the same Privileges in my Absence as you now have Why then return'd my Friend don't you be surpriz'd at what I shall say to her  We parted and went to prepare every thing for my intended Journey When I was at Dinner with my Wife I gave her some Hints concerning my Friend and that I desir'd he should have Admittance in my Absence I observ'd she chang'd Colour at my Discourse and seem'd to be in the utmost Confusion altho' I did not seem to see it  After some Talk about indifferent Matters she told me if I thought fit she intended to live private in my Absence and admit of no Visitors For Sir said she the World will be censorious and receiving Visits from a Man when you are from Home is not consisting with our  Spanish  Customs She found by my Discourse that I was  determin'd it should be so wherefore she left off arguing upon that Subject but I could perceive all the time we were together my Resolves sat very uneasy upon her and it was with much Difficulty she restrain'd her Tears Her Sorrow struck me to the Heart and it was the greatest struggle I ever went through to keep my Temper For I imagin'd all her Grief was to have this Spy upon her Actions  When Night approach'd my Friend came according to Appointment and during our Supper I told my Wife she was to look upon him as my only Friend and give him the same Admittance as if it was my self in every thing he should desire well knowing I told her he would ask nothing contrary to our strict Amity  Sir said my Friend I am very sorry I can't comply with your Desires for I have receiv'd Letters from a near Relation at  Panama  and I am obliged to attend his Nuptials being he can't make proper Marriage Settlements without I am upon the Spot and I fear I shall hardly return this six Weeks I was at first very much surpriz'd at this his sudden Resolution and was going to say something upon't till I observ'd he wink'd at me I then began to remember what he said to me in the Morning that I should not take Notice of what he said But I observ'd the Cloud upon my Wife's Face began to disappear by degrees which seem'd to me the greatest Proof of her Infidelity I was so provok'd with the imaginary Wrong that I could not help shewing it in Words and Actions but yet I had so much Reason in my Madness for Passion is no less that I conceal'd the real Clause  My Wife seem'd confounded at my incoherent Anger having never seen my Fury before and  when my Friend was gone begg'd I would tell her the real cause of my Uneasiness for she was well assur'd some secret Cause had ruffled my Temper but I persisted in the Obstinacy of not discovering it to her and the next Day pursu'd my Journey with a dismal Idea of what was to come  Thought had so much impair'd my Strength with its violent Workings that I found it a difficult thing to sit my Horse and when I came to my Inn at Night I was carry'd to Bed in a violent Feaver and all Night was in a Delirium My Servants sent for a Physician who gave me something to resist my Malady and while he was with me I utter'd some Words in my Ravings that gave him to understand my Disease proceeded from the Mind When I came to my self I was something surpriz'd to hear him speak to me after this Manner  Sir I have so long dealt with Diseases of most kinds that I have Knowledge enough to perceive when they proceed from an ill habit of Body or those Maladies of the Mind that slight all Physic and be not amaz'd when I tell you I have often cur'd the Latter by wholsome Advice You are a young Man and perhaps may have taken a wrong Conception of Things if you will be pleas'd to tell me your Case I'll give you my Advice without a Fee and don't think me impertinent to desire it I have seen more Years than you You may conceal your Name in your Relation and if my Advice does not please you you are but just where you were I shall be as faithful in keeping your Secret as your Confessor  You may be assur'd I was very much surpriz'd at his Proceeding and I easily perceiv'd a Sincerity in his Discourse that gain'd him my Esteem and I was resolv'd to let him  into my Story which I did as much as I have to you  After a Pause he said I had just come up to his Imagination of my Case and now Sir said he I will proceed to my Advice Consider well what you are about you have confess'd your Friend own'd to you he made pretended Love to your Wife to try her Virtue and yet I don't find he advis'd with you about it before he had put his Device in Practice To give you my Sentiments of this Matter I believe your Friend to be false to you and that he really is in Love with your Wife The Distress of your Spouse proceeded from her Indignation to him and Love to you His telling you after his Attempt upon her was no more than to be the first in the Declaration as imagining she would of course inform you with it her keeping it a Secret from you was not to make you uneasy and his declaring his Suspicion of her Virtue afterwards was either to be reveng'd on her for slighting his Passion or to give him an Opportunity in your Absence to wrong your Wife  This in short I fancy will prove the whole Truth Neither is this Judgment hard to make for I am apt to believe any disinterested Person would make the same Judgment your Passion has blinded yours yet nevertheless if you can give your self time to think calmly I don't in the least doubt but you'll be of my Opinion This I am assur'd of Jealousy is a certain sign of Love and if you should in the heat of Passion do a rash Deed every Moment of your Life will prove a Torment to you Lovers Eyes are often false and too quick in false Creations Call Reason to your Assistance that will prove your best Friend Take some time to think of my Advice and Counsel Friends may assoon prove false as  Wives and you had better lose the former than the latter  All the while he was speaking methought I was listening to an Oracle and at the end of his Discourse I could not help blaming my self for my rash Belief I call'd over in my Memory every Moment of my Wife's Behaviour and could not find any one Action start up to give me that hard Opinion I had rashly conceiv'd against her  I return'd the Physician of my Mind as well as Body many Thanks for his cordial Advice and would have paid him in another Coin but I could not prevail upon him to take a single Dollar No said he in accepting of your Money I shall make it appear that like Lawyers I pleaded for my Fee No Sir all the Recompence I shall ask of you is only to let me know the Truth of every thing when the Catastrophe is over which I hope will not affect your Wife And if I might throw in one Word of Advice more if you prove the Friend you have so much confided in to be false shew your Resentment by slighting him and leave Revenge to Heaven I promis'd to follow his judicious Advice in every Thing and so we parted with a very good Regard for each other  I was resolved to proceed no farther on my Journey but make the best of my Way back again and as I went along consider of my Behaviour and let Time alone for Proof The Reason I gave my Servants for returning was that I had not Strength to pursue my Journey which in Reality was no Falshood for I was weak enough and I am convinc'd that Disorders of the Mind weaken the Body more than habitual Distempers In part of my Journey back I could not come to any Resolution how to behave  and therefore resolved to lye one more Night upon the Road to see if my Pillow would advise me When I arriv'd at my Inn one of my Servants told me  Don Roderigo  was just alighted Hearing him nam'd my Blood ran a wild Course about my Body and immediately it struck to my Mind something was not right  I ask'd my Servant if  Roderigo  had seen him he told me no and that he seem'd disguis'd as if he did not desire to be known This strengthen'd my Suspicion of some Ill intended or done already and that he was making his Escape I order'd my Servants not to appear But when Supper was ready I sent for my Host to bear me Company where after some trivial Discourse I ask'd him what Guests he had in the House He made no Scruple in telling me but when he came to  Don Roderigo  he declar'd he did not much like him for he seem'd very willing to be private with two of his Servants and he had observ'd 'em often whispering They design said he to be going very early in the Morning but I don't know which Road they travel I conceal'd my Disturbance of Mind from my Host but resolv'd to be going as early as  Don Roderigo  and to be sure of being early enough I determin'd not to go to Bed notwithstanding the Weakness of my Body requir'd Repose  In the middle of the Night I heard People whispering in the next Room and I could easily distinguish  Roderigo  's Voice tho' I could gather little of their Discourse yet I could hear mine and my Wife's Name often mention'd  At break of Day I found they were preparing to be gone and tho' I was pretty expeditious yet they were got out of the Inn before  I could get on Horseback with my Servants I was much vex'd at it yet pursu'd my Journey homeward But I was very much amaz'd when about two Leagues from  Lima  I met my Wife in a Coach with her Maid and two  Indian  Servants The Servants assoon as they saw me were overjoy'd and my Wife could not open her Mouth for some time I then began to relapse into my former Jealousie and imagin'd she was following  Don Roderigo  At last she open'd her Mouth with a great deal of Joy Lord my Dear said she is it you in Reality or are my Senses deceiv'd I ask'd her the Reason of her Journey and her mighty Surprize Sir answer'd she that Question confounds me have I not a Letter from you to come with all Speed imaginable Here it is continu'd she I took the Letter from her and read the Contents  My Dear  PUrsuing my Journey I had the Misfortune to fall from my Horse and break my Arm which prevents my writing to you The Accident is attended with a violent Feaver which I am told is very dangerous I have refrain'd writing to you till now as expecting some Amendment but finding my self worse I beg you will come to me with all the Expedition imaginable for fear you should never see me more alive  Your Affectionate Husband  There needed no Sphynx to unriddle this Enigma and I observ'd by my Wife's Countenance we both knew the Author of the Letter While we were confus'd the Coachman that drove the Coach was stealing away but  my Wife cry'd out to stop him for that was the Messenger that brought the Letter to her and farther told her he was to conduct her to me for the Coachman we had before was drown'd and that Circumstance 'deceiv'd her more than any thing else The Fellow also told her that I had prevail'd with a Gentleman in the Neighbourhood where I lay hurt to send him to drive the Coach I rid after the Fellow and brought him back order'd him into the Coachbox and forc'd him to drive out of the Road to a neighbouring Village where liv'd a Gentleman of my Acquaintance He very unwillingly comply'd with my Commands and we kept very close to him to prevent his making away When we arriv'd at my Friend's House we secur'd the Fellow in a strong Room and I left two of my  Indian  Servants to guard him I made my Friend acquainted with the Accident and that this Visit was not intended but by meer Chance He gave me to know I was welcome let what would bring me there  When my Wife and I with my Friend were alone I tenderly embrac'd her and begg'd her Pardon for my unjust Suspicions of her Virtue and related the whole Progress of my Jealousie without omitting the least Circumstance She gave thanks to Heav'n for the Danger she was sav'd from and related to me the manner of her being deceiv'd by the Fellow that brought the Letter as follows  The fifth Day after you had left me as I was musing in the Garden my Maid told me a Person had a Letter to deliver me from you I began to tremble with timorous Apprehension and my whole Frame felt violent Disorders I order'd the Bearer to be brought to me and when I had read the Letter Grief lock'd up my  Tongue and I had not power to speak for some time When I had recover'd Speech I ask'd the Fellow where you were Madam said he he is at Don  Florio  's Countryhouse  naming a Friend of mine that my Wife had heard me often mention  and knowing you had never a Coachman my Master sent me to conduct you to your Husband I would not spend time in dressing my self but just as I was with my Maid and the two  Indians  pursu'd our Journey I never once dream'd of any Treachery tho' I always doubted your false Friend but as he had never been to visit me in your Absence it wip'd away all Suspicions of him I observ'd the Coachman by his Looks did not like the Company of my Servants but I was too much concern'd for you to think of it much  We congratulated one another again at our happy Deliverance and admir'd the workings of Divine Providence and the second Cause my friendly Physician  My Wife express'd a great Desire to see him to return him Acknowledgments for his inspir'd Advice and in the Morning I promis'd her to go to him if we could get any convenient Carriage For we were not very fond of making Use of the Coachman that brought her out  I defer'd his Examination till the next Day being too much fatigu'd to do it then tho' I order'd he should want nothing but his Liberty for I consider'd him only as an Instrument to work his Master's Ends When I was up in the Morning I order'd him to be brought before me but after some time they brought me Word he had made his Escape by creeping through the Cieling of the Room and throwing down the Shingles for it was a single Apartment near the Garden I was a little uneasy  at his getting away as well as my Wife for fear his Master should make some Attempt upon us in the House where we were it being a quarter of a Mile from the Village and the Gentleman my Friend had but few Servants Therefore it was thought the safest Course for us to go immediately to  Lima  And assoon as we could procure Mules we set out and reach'd that City without Molestation  I heard nothing of the faithless  Roderigo  for several Days neither did I think it strange for I imagin'd if he had any Shame left he would not dare to appear publickly at  Lima  but if he did I had resolv'd to take my friendly▪ Physician's Advice which had prov'd so successful to me to show my Resentment in slighting him  One Night as soft Repose had lock'd up our Senses we were alarm'd from our downy Sleep by a fearful cry of Fire Fire I rose and ran into my Wife's Apartment where she remain'd frighted almost to death and as People generally in the alarm of Fire know not what they do she ran to the Chamber where the Maids lay and dress'd herself in her Servant's Cloaths the Maid being equally frighted when she found she had no Cloaths to put on clap'd on her Mistress's which I had brought after her and was running down Stairs to free herself from the Danger As she was going through the Hall I observ'd four Men in Masks seiz'd her and carry'd her off I follow'd with my Sword in my Hand till one of the villanous Company came behind me and run me through the Back My Servants who came after me bore me in faint with loss of Blood but by good Fortune the Wound did not prove dangerous tho' well meant  We could never come by the Truth how the House was set on Fire tho' it was soon extinguish'd but we were assur'd it must be by some one of the Domestics It was easy to judge Don  Roderigo  was the Cause on't by running away with the Maid as mistaking her for my Wife because she had in the Hurry put on her Mistress's Cloaths and Vail  I was advis'd by my best Friends to summon him before the supream Judge for it was dangerous to let him go on with Impunity But he would not obey the Summons therefore he was design'd to be outlaw'd by due course of Law But as that takes up several Months I was oblig'd to keep a Guard in my House for I received several menacing Letters frequently from him either thrown over the Wall or left so that we could never secure any Person that brought 'em While our Suit was going on our new ViceRoy arriv'd who proving a Friend to Don  Roderigo  a  nolle prosequi  was issued out and I was obliged to stand at the whole Charge of the Lawsuit This violent and unjust Proceeding of the ViceRoy's rais'd my Gaul to that degree that I said many warm things against his Administration which came to his Knowledge for there are generally poorspirited Wretches in all Governments that have no other Merit than to improve Tales and feed the Ears of their Superiors with nauseous Flattery and Lyes  I was sent for to the ViceRoy and examin'd concerning these Reports and I so far incens'd him with my Replies to his Questions that if I had not met with some Friends that palliated the Matter I don't know how far his Resentment would have carry'd him I was dismiss'd with my Liberty but a multitude of Menaces if for the future I ever gave my Tongue another loose  and I soon found the Effects of his Resentment by losing a small Place in the Government but as Providence had put me above wanting it I was not much griev'd at the Loss  My Wife begg'd me to remove from  Lima  a Place where I had receiv'd so many Insults and it was not improbable but I might receive more which prov'd but too true  In a few Days after I had appear'd before the ViceRoy the Maid that was forc'd away by mistaking her for my Wife came home miserably ill us'd and brought me a Letter from the ungrateful Don  Roderigo  which you may read if you please upon that he took the Letter out of his Pocket and I found it as follows  I  Declare my self your inveterate Enemy tho' I have no just Reason to be so you may be sure my Enmity is rooted for ever in my Heart and I shall have no Rest in this World till thou art out of it I should not perhaps be so free in declaring my Mind by Writing if I was not very well assur'd thy publishing it would do thee no good I have so much Honour in me still as to assure thee I would venture my Life to hazard thine and if I have ever the Opportunity I shall put it to the Hazard therefore be well guarded whenever thou appearest abroad Minds like mine are never appeas'd I always was a Villain but had so much Cunning to hide it from the World till now this Affair has publish'd it And be assur'd I shall study every way to compass my Revenge whilst I am  Roderigo  The Insolence of this Letter was not to be born and I was as impatient to meet him as he could be to meet with me and I must own to you I thirsted for his Blood for his Usage was beyond  the nature of Man to bear I examin'd the poor Girl of what she knew of the Wretch who inform'd me that they put her into a Coach and carry'd her a League out of Town but when they found their Mistake the Usage she bore from 'em was insupportable and the Brute  Roderigo  told his Servants if they pleas'd to make use of her in the vilest Manner they were welcome The Wretches that serv'd such a Villain must have very near the same Sentiments of Honour and Honesty or they would seek another Master they were too forward to neglect such a Cruelty and four of 'em by turns ravish'd her Strangers to the nature of the Wretches who are Superiors in this Part of the World would imagine such Deeds should find Punishment by Law But alas Justice is fled the Place and we may expect more Mercy from the worst of Cannibals than is to be found here  The poor Creature in a little Time felt the farther Effects of their Cruelty for they gave her a Distemper that ended her Life  Before her Death she gave me Knowledge of the Place where they led her for they had not any Caution in their villanous Proceeding but assoon as they had gratify'd their Lust and Cruelty turn'd her out of Doors  I had no farther need of any thing to whet my Revenge but I must own the Death of this unfortunate poor Creature added Fuel to the Fire My Wife was almost distracted at the unhappy Accident and had no other Consolation but that she had escap'd their cruel Hands  I did not acquaint her with my Intention of seeking this Villain but I made it my only Business I went to the Place the poor Maid had directed me where I had Information that he had left the Place and now resided in  Lima  I was  very sorry he had chang'd his Habitation because I should find it a more difficult thing to execute my Resentment with Safety in  Lima  But however I sent him the following Letter  THY Usage to me is not to be born therefore if thou hast that Spirit which I much question from thy Villany for Villains are always Cowards meet me in St  Justin  's Field tomorrow at six in the Morning as I imagine there is no Second in thy Villany I shall expect thee alone and I hope thou wilt not fail to meet the injur'd  Alonzo de Castro  I chose St  Justin  's Field for the Conveniency of a small Publickhouse which overlook'd it where I went before Day that I might discover if he came alone for I had but little reason to expect fair Play from such a Villain When the time came I saw him go by the House alone I let him pass by me to see if he was not follow'd by any of his cursed Crew but finding none I hasted after him into the middle of the Field and call'd to him he turn'd about and with the Image of Hell in his Face he cry'd I thought your Resentment would have brought you first into the Field But as I am here before you it speaks me no Coward tho' your vile Scrawl would intimate as much Come said I no Words thy Breath is Poison to me it will insect the Air Only this Sir said he as you had not nam'd any particular Weapon I have made bold to bring a pair of Pistols with me and to let you see I have some Honour you shall take your Choice I gave him no Answer but took one and we agreed to stand at such a Distance As I was going to Fire he cry'd out  Hold I will tell you one Secret more before we engage and that's this Your Pistol is only charg'd with Powder but mine with Ball which I put in since you made the Choice and now prepare for Death be assur'd this is the last Moment of thy Life I did not give my self time to answer but fir'd my Pistol and then hurl'd it at him and had the good Fortune to cut him in the Face with it and in the Confusion and Surprize his Pistol went off without hurting me Now said I thou Wretch we are once more on equal Terms and Heav'n I hope will favour the justest Cause We drew and in a few Passes I laid him for dead on the Ground tho' in the Encounter I had receiv'd a dangerous Wound in the Breast I went home notwithstanding my Hurt and sent secretly for a Surgeon of my Acquaintance who dress'd me and told me I was in no Danger  My Wife was very much griev'd at the Accident tho' she could not but be pleas'd at  Roderigo  's Death yet her Fears increas'd as imagining I should suffer for it by the violent Temper of the Viceroy But her Grief began to blow over when in several Days after no Enquiry was made nor even any Notice taken of his Death  I was very much surpriz'd at it imagining I had really kill'd him  Assoon as my Wound was well I went to the little House to enquire if they knew any thing of the Body for the Owner of the House was formerly my Servant and a Man of much Probity who knew all my Story he inform'd me that a little while after I past by his House home again five Persons ran that way and coming to the Body seem'd to mourn over it and went the Road that leads to St  Dominick a Village about half a Mile from the Place where we fought  I imagin'd they had bury'd him privately in that Village and went home to acquaint my Wife who shar'd my Contentment  I now went abroad as I was wont and all the Discourse was of Don  Roderigo  's sudden disappearing Servants and all had left his House but no one suspected any thing of his Death Some of my Acquaintance told me they imagin'd this to be some Trick of his and that he only lay dormant to meditate some Mischief to me  I seem'd to come into their Fears but in my Mind slighted their Advice as imagining I had nothing to fear I past on a whole Month without any Danger at all but as I was going one Day across the Bridge to a Warehouse I had in the Suburbs a Fellow came up to me and privately ask'd me if I would be his Chapman for some  EastIndia  Goods He told me a long Story that he was oblig'd to make up a Cargo and leave this Part of the World for his Credit began to fail and if he did not get away speedily his Creditors would lay him up We went to a neighbouring Tavern where he read me his Bill of Parcels He told me he had been encourag'd to offer his Goods to me from the fairness of my Character and was coming to wait on me when he had the good Fortune to meet me The next Day was agreed on for me to go and view the Goods for I was not to pay for 'em till they were enter'd my Warehouse Accordingly as appointed I went to the House of the Person in the  Benedictine  Street I was shown into a Room till the Goods were brought but as I was looking on some Paintings five Men rush'd out of a Closet in the Room and seiz'd me They disarm'd me took out every thing that was in my Pockets went out and lock'd me in  You may imagine the Surprize I was in which was very much increas'd when I saw my Enemy  Don Roderigo  enter the Room I in my Confusion thought I had seen a Ghost for he look'd very pale but he soon convinc'd me of the contrary And have I got you at last said he I now will revenge my self at leisure but to compleat my Revenge I have sent a Token for your Wife that I may ravish her before thy Face and then I'll devise Tortures to rack every Joint about thee He gave me to know that he had sent my Watch for a Token and that she would bring such a Sum of Money to pay for the Goods The Torment of my Soul no Tongue can express and I am assur'd if they had not taken my Sword from me I had put an End to my wretched Life  The inhumane Villain insulted me so much that I rush'd upon him unarm'd as I was and had certainly choak'd him if his wicked Assistants had not dragg'd me from him  It is well said he I have no other Passion but Lust reigning in my Breast at this Instant but when I have sated my Desires on thy Wife I'll then add another Pang for this Usage but in the mean time I'll leave you to think of this Matter alone for I fancy you don't much care for my Company  Assoon as he had made an End of this Speech he and his Gang went out and fasten'd the Door on the other side I'll give you Leave to imagine the Confusion of my Thoughts I remain'd some time without moving but accidentally casting my Eyes on the Door I observ'd there was a Bar to shut it on the inside I immediately barr'd it and began to look about to see if I could find any thing for my Defence but to my Grief could perceive nothing  I enter'd the Closet and search'd there but to no purpose Looking upon the Floor of the Closet I perceiv'd one of the Boards seem'd to be loose I essay'd to pull it up but wanted some Engine to effect it I at last thought of the Bar of the Door ran to it and by main Force wrench'd it from the Staple for I thought if it would not serve me to make my Escape it would serve me to defend my self but I easily forc'd up the Board and with my Bar beat down the Ceiling under me I was resolv'd to explore the hidden Place whatever was the Consequence for it could not be worse than to remain where I was I therefore ventur'd down though something of a difficult Descent for the Joyces were so close together I had much ado to force my Body through but at last with much Difficulty I press'd through and had a desperate Fall to the Ground  I soon found I had got into a Cooper's Collar for there were several Pipestaves and Tools to work with I seiz'd upon some of them and by Force wrench'd open the CellarDoor which led me once more into the Street before  Don Roderigo  's House I did not give my self Time to consider but ran towards the Bridge to get to my own House and just as I enter'd the  Cordeliers  Street I met my Wife with her Maid and the Wretch that had decoy'd me to the House I ran upon him seiz'd him by the Throat and flung him over the Bridge where he met with the Reward of his Villany I had not Power of Speech to inform my Wife of the Accident but made Signs for her to go home By this time it was dark and the profligate Villain  Don Roderigo  fancying his cursed Emissary staid too long came out of his Door which fac'd the Bridge Assoon  as I discover'd him I ran towards him and seiz'd him Now Villain said I I will not part with thee till thou hast render'd up thy Soul to Hell We both struggled and I kept him down but the rest of his Company coming up to his Assistance I quitted him and runring to see if I could meet with some one arm'd I had the good Fortune to light on you Assoon as I receiv'd your Sword I ran back and just met the Villain as he was entring his Door I ran the Weapon into his very Heart and I believe you were a better Witness of his Death than my self being you were found near the Body  Assoon as I saw him fall I made the best of my way home not imagining you would meet with any farther Damage than the Loss of your Sword  The Darkness of the Night I fancy conceal'd me from the Servants that came to the Assistance of their Master for I never once was suspected or perhaps if they did know me Fear kept 'em from discovering me  When I heard of your Tryal I came my self into Court and if you had been condemn'd resolv'd to have discover'd the Truth but finding you were to be banished to  Baldivia  I conceal'd the Fact imagining I had it in my Power to gain your Freedom by paying your Ransom which was the Reason I came now to wait upon you to offer you my Service in that or any thing else that lies in my Power I return'd him Thanks for his Offer and considering his Story I told him I was glad I was in some sort an Instrument of his Revenge He would force upon me a Ring and two hundred Pieces of Gold and begg'd he might be rank'd in the Number of my Friends He made me many  Visits and once brought his Wife with him She was a very handsome Woman and seem'd to have a great deal of Wit She made me several very handsome Compliments in behalf of her Husband and begg'd I would accept of their Pictures set round with fine oriental Pearls  He accompany'd me on Board when our Vessel was to set Sail putting in the Captain's Hands fresh Provision and several sorts of good Liquor to comfort me in my Voyage  I had the Happiness to have Pirates for my FellowSuflerers and the Viceroy had given out to take off all Censure from him that I encourag'd 'em in their Piracy  We took our Leaves with Protestations of a lasting Friendship and I liv'd as merrily as I could till the Day we had the good Fortune to meet with you which has not given me any Reason to change my Humour  WE were mightily diverted with the Relation of  Don Pedro  and I found I was not deceiv'd when I took him for a Man that understood the World  We had now gain'd the Streights of  Gibraltar  and had enter'd the  Mediterranean  Sea But I must confess I could not see the  African  Shore without Numbers of Sighs for Misfortunes past and I found my Griefs renew'd with the Remembrance And all the Mitigation I had was the affectionate Concern from  Don Ferdinand  to whom I had told my whole Story We had not made a Day's Sail in the  Mediterranean  ere we perceiv'd two Sail making towards us I must own I had no Desire to engage being so richly laden and therefore by the Advice of both the Ships Company made all the Sail I could to avoid 'em But our Vessels being foul with so long a Voyage and never once clean'd during our whole  Course they gain'd upon us do what we could When we found there was no getting from 'em without Fighting we were as much determin'd on the other Hand to fight our Ships to the Bottom of the Sea rather than surrender Having fix'd this Resolution we prepar'd for the Engagement and when we had got all Things in Readiness we lessen'd our Sails that they might come up to us I order'd every Sailor to load as many small Arms as they could and not to fire a Gun till I gave 'em Orders but assoon as ever they had fir'd the great Guns to discharge their small Arms upon 'em I could not prevail upon  Don Ferdinand  to keep below though I saw Fear livelily painted in his Face When they came within Pistolshot of our Ship they hail'd us and commanded us to strike immediately We made no other Answer than with our Guns and small Arms which surpriz'd 'em and did 'em a great deel of Damage in their Rigging for cutting the Topsail Halliards with our Shot the Topsail fell down upon the Cap and hinder'd their Ship's Way very much and I believe we might have made our Escape But I perceiv'd the  Villars  was hard put to it our  Spanish  Man of War whom I had nam'd the  Villars  in Remembrance of that dear One By this time we were prepar'd again and I order'd every Man assoon as they had discharg'd to lye flat upon their Bellies till we had receiv'd the Fire of the Enemy which accordingly we did They fir'd in upon us▪ but kill'd  not one Man Then our Ha  ose up all together and fir'd in our small Shot We had so damag'd their Rigging with this Broadside that we fell astern till we were charg'd again and then I gave our Men Orders to fire into the Body of the Ship and point their Guns low on purpose  which we soon found had the desir'd Effect For they had several Shots between Wind and Water so that they were oblig'd to heel the Ship on the Starboard Side to prevent the Water running in on the Larboard I seeing there was not much to be fear'd from her bore down to assist the  Villars  because she was overmatch'd But when her Antagonist found my Design and understood the Condition of the other Ship she made all the Sail she could and fled for it We did not think fit to follow her but sent a Boat on Board to enquire how it stood with 'em in the  Villars  They sent me Word they had lost eight Men had three wounded and were very much mawl'd in their Rigging as well as their Hull and had receiv'd a Shot between Wind and Water and the Ship leak'd very much I bad 'em search for it but there was no coming at it therefore I order'd them to get out as many of the Goods as they could and bring them on Board me The Weather proving very favourable they went to Work as fast as they could  Our Men brought me Word that the Ship we had engag'd was sinking They fir'd several Guns for Assistance and their Consort being almost out of Sight I bore down to help them all I could but before we could come to 'em she sunk to the Bottom The Men had put out their Longboat and Barge and were got in them and made towards us Assoon as they came within hearing they call'd out for  Quarter  which I promis'd 'em they sh uld have There were of 'em and as their Number exceeded ours we were oblig'd to confine 'em for fear they should take it in their Heads to set upon us  The Captain was kill'd in the Engagement but the Lieutenant inform'd me they were two  Men of War of forty Guns each set out from  Barcelona  to cruise upon the Coast and mann'd each with two hundred Men But the rest of their Crew were either kill'd or being wounded sunk with the Ship I did not think it proper to carry 'em to  Italy  for fear it should prove prejudicial to  Don Antonio  and understanding that in removing the Goods on Board the  Villars  they had found out the Leak and stopp'd it I intended to put 'em on board her and give 'em the Ship with their Liberty but first I order'd out the Guns and Ammunition and her Goods leaving 'em nothing but Provision and Water which they return'd me many Thanks for and so we parted  The next Day there arose such a Storm as we had never felt before and continu'd in the utmost Violence for fourteen Days so that now we were in Danger of drowning and I believe most would have parted with their Wealth to have been safe on Shore At last we discover'd Land but were very much surpriz'd to find it  Candia  for now we began to be in fear of the  Turkish  Pirates So we resolv'd to steer for  Zant  as fast as we could and there make Dividend of our PrizeMoney and Goods And accordingly we arriv'd there safely  Sept    This Island of  Zant  belongs to the  Venetians  therefore we were out of Danger from the  Turks  The Town which bears the same Name with the Island is above a Mile in Length seated upon a Beach of the Bay It is built mostly of Stone and has a noble Look from the Sea To the West of the Town stands the Castle built on a high and very steep Hill where most of the Merchants dwell and is very near as big as the City below It is a Bishop's See and the Governour is of the Nobility of  Venice  The chief Commodities they deal in are Wine Oyl and Currants which are esteem'd of the best Growth They grow on Vines like other Grapes and are gather'd in  July  and then pack'd in Hogsheads ready for the Merchants  Our Men being well pleas'd they were out of Danger and in a Place where Wine was to be bought cheap traffick'd so much for that Commodity that most of them fell into dangerous Diseases therefore I resolv'd to leave  Zant  and make for  Sapienza  an Island with a good Harbour not inhabited where they would not be under the like Temptation so we came to an Anchor there  Sept  I order'd twelve Guns on Shore and rais'd a Platform capable of defending us from the insults of an Enemy In a pleasant Green we put up a large Tent and others smaller by it for the Officers and Sailors But I having but one Bed put up on Shore  Don Ferdinand  was forc'd to lie with me tho' as I thought very unwillingly Our sharing the ready Money took us up four Days I reserv'd a fourth Part to my Owners which amounted to upwards of sixty thousand Pound and a twelfth Part for my self which with what Presents and other Things that I had amounted to the value of fifty thousand Pound Every Sailor from first to last shar'd above twelve hundred Pound apiece but when we came to divide the Goods we knew not which way to go about it so with one common Consent of the Sailors I was oblig'd to accept of them without paying one Penny for them  We set Sail for  Ostia  the next Day after we had finish'd our Dividend and arriv'd there  Nov  after a Voyage of two Years and seven Months and the richest Prize that ever came into any Port of  Italy  I sent a Letter to  Don Antonio  to give him  Notice of my Arrival and Advice to come and take Care of his Cargo In two Days he  Donna Isabella  and their little Son came on Board in a PleasureBoat I found they were in Mourning and I told 'em I was afraid to ask 'em who it was for they inform'd me that  Isabella  's Father had been dead above two Years but they had resolv'd never to wear any other Colour till they had seen me Never was a more tender Meeting between Friends than between us and I must confess for some time all my Cares lay hush'd  When I came to inform  Don Antonio  of the Wealth I had brought him home he stood amaz'd For besides the Money which I told him of the Goods I had on Board exceeded in value the Freight I went out with I could hardly prevail upon him to accept of such a Sum of Money till I inform'd him it was but barely his Due and that I had very near as much to my own Share  I presented  Don Ferdinand  to  Antonio  and his Lady who seem'd very much pleas'd with him and  Don Pedro  out of his free merry Humour told me he hop'd I would not forget him because he was older for he thought he had more Right to my Friendship than  Don Ferdinand  being he was an older Acquaintance I let 'em into some of his Life and Humour they receiv'd him yery friendly and we all went to  Don Antonio  's  Villa  together  After staying a Week I began to be tir'd with so much Pleasure and therefore begg'd Leave of  Don Antonio  to visit  Rome  only to shew  Don Ferdinand  that celebrated Place  Don Antonio  sent before to his Palace to prepare for our Reception and the next Day we follow'd We visited all the Rarities ancient and modern  where we might see the Grandeur of the antient  Romans  by those stupendous Ruins still left As  Rome  was formerly a Nursery of War and Greatness it is now a Nursery of Arts but chiefly Painting Architecture and Musick There have flourish'd in one Century  Lanfranio Dominichino Pietro du Cortona  the  Possine's Camassei Guercin da Cento Chivoli Andrea Sacchi  the immortal  Raphael Hannibal Carac  e Guide Rene Mutiano  and many more excellent in the Art of Painting Then  Palladio Vitruvius Scamozzi Pozza  and many more famous for Architecture Then the divine  Corelli  for Musick whose sweet Compositions will be always new and we may say by him as a great  English  Poet said of our Countryman  Shakespear  that the former had pull'd up the Roots of Musick as the latter of Poetry and transplanted 'em into their own Gardens where all those that follow must borrow a Branch from them  I shall not say any thing more of  Rome  nor of  Naples  where we went once more upon  Don Ferdinand  's Account I would have persuaded him to have begun his Studies at  Rome  for I suppos'd him a  Roman Catholick  but he would not hear of it and begg'd he might go with me into  England  which I promis'd him he should  Donna Isabella  had an Orphan Cousin that liv'd with her of a vast Fortune beautiful to a Miracle who having seen Don  Ferdinand  fell desperately in Love with him But he did not seem to have the least Regard for her  Don Antonio  discover'd to me the Secret and pitying by Experience his Kinswoman desir'd I would foward the Match But when  Don Ferdinand  understood my Desires he fell upon his Knees and begg'd I would never mention it  more for he had made a solemn Resolution never to marry any Woman breathing I press'd him all I could and laid the Folly of such a rash Resolve before him but it was preaching to a Tempest and all my Arguments had no Power upon him On the other hand the merry  Don Pedro  was as deep in Love with  Donna Felicia  which was the Name of the Orphan Lady But his manner of Courtship was so odd and out of the way that he caus'd more Diversion than we could have imagin'd If she went to Bed he would lay himself down at her Chamber Door and sing Songs all Night that if she had any Inclination to have rested he was resolv'd she should not and he would often say he intended to plague her into a Complyance If she went into the Garden he was sure to follow her close or even at Church he would often tell her it was in vain to pray for a Blessing from Heaven when she was committing Murder with every Look In short he would often force a Smile from the afflicted Lady her self  I was still endeavouring with  Don Ferdinand  to forget his rash Vow But he desir'd me in such moving T  ms not to intreat him further that I resolv'd never to trouble him any more on that Theme Notwithstanding which I begg'd of  Donna Isabella  to try what she could do with him for I imagin'd Complaisance might work more upon him than Friendship She sent for him into her Closet and they remain'd together several Hours and I was very much pleas'd the next Day to see him walking in the Garden only with  Donna Felicia  I did not think it proper to interrupt them but when I had an Opportunity I declar'd my Satisfaction and told him I easily forgave his not complying with me and yielding to the Perswasion of  Donna Isabella  He seem'd in some Confusion at what I said to him which I attributed to his denying me and his Condescension to  Donna Isabella  But in a few Days after that I was something more surpriz'd to see  Don Pedro  eagerly addressing  Donna Felicia  and she regarding him more favourably than usual And my Surprize was encreas'd when  Donna Isabella  told me the nuptial Day was fix'd between  Don Pedro  and  Donna Felicia  I told her I was very well pleas'd the Lady had so soon forgot her violent Passion but I added that the stronger the Flame the shorter the Duration If so return'd  Donna Isabella  we may hope your Passion is bury'd long since I told her I did not Love like others for I was resolv'd to carry mine with me to the Grave By what I have formerly heard return'd  Donna Isabella  from you as well as my Husband you have not the least glimpse of Hopes Madam said I that is the Reason I must despair for no other Fire shall ever warm my Breast but what was kindled there by my first Flame We had much Discourse upon the same Subject and  Donna Isabella  told me at last I was a Pattern for all faithful Lovers  When we were at  Naples  I had provided Goods and Conveniency of sending to St  Salvador  according to my Promise given to  Don Jaques  and the Vessel being to touch at  Ostia  was to send to me for my Letters to  Don Jaques  I desir'd  Don Ferdinand  to write to his Father but he begg'd to be excus'd for fear it should fall into the Hands of his Lady and for the same Reason he begg'd I would be cautious how I mention'd him I told him he should see what I had wrote before I sent it which was as follows  SIR  I Know not how to make you Acknowledgments sufficient for those Favours so generously conferr'd upon me and the Manner of doing it stamps a double Value on the Obligation If there is no way to repay the mighty Debt yet I shall with the utmost Gratitude remember  Don Jaques  and his kind Benefits I have done my self the Honour to send you those Things you were desirous of the last Time I had the Happiness of conversing with you which I beg you will accept only for this Reason that you may see you shall ever live in the Remembrance of one who shall think it the best good Fortune can fall upon him to subscribe himself  Your sincere Friend and Servant Robert Boyle  P S  I also beg you to give my humble Duty to your good Lady and virtuous Daughter and be assur'd whatever you have given me in Charge shall have the same Regard as if an immortal Spirit had descended from above and written in my Heart your Commission Whatever Letters you are pleas'd to honour me with direct for me at the Palace of  Antonio de Alvares  in  Rome  who will take Care to send 'em to me whereever I am for as yet I am undetermin'd where to settle my self but I have  England  in View  I wrote this Letter in the  Portugueze  Language and shew'd it to  Don Ferdinand  who approv'd of what I had written  I had dispos'd of the rest of my Goods on Board and the Money amounted to upwards of fifteen thousand Pound but I could not prevail  upon  Don Antonio  to accept of one Penny  No my dear Friend said he you have already brought me the Fortune of a Nobleman tho' it is not worldly Wealth I covet I have all the Earth contains in the Possession of my adorable Wife and even that my greatest Happiness is owing to you and all the Allay of Joy I have is that I cannot see you as blest as I am But continu'd he Time that wears out all things will I hope cure this amorous Sickness of your Soul I let him know my Grief was as fix'd as Destiny and I had nothing else to do but to wing to the Place where the Joy of my Life did once reside with this only Hope that the lively Imagination of my Loss would put an end to all my Sorrows by sinking me into the Arms of Death  He was so very much concern'd for me that he could not avoid shedding Tears and us'd all the Arguments he could to persuade me to reside in  Italy  I told him I had more Reasons to go for my native Country than what I had given him and that was the Education of young  Don Ferdinand  who begg'd to cultivate his Studies in  England  I turn'd all my Money into Bills of Exchange well knowing the Casualties that attend Travellers and I intended to go by Land to  Flanders  with  Don Ferdinand  my two faithful  Indians  and one Servant more  All my  Spanish  Sailors that I had pick'd up by the Way had by my Consent their Discharge and were gone to their several Homes in Circumstances beyond their Expectations though they all declar'd if I intended another Voyage they would never forsake me Some  of my  English  Sailors had married  Italian  Women and so design'd to settle in  Italy  When I desir'd  Don Antonio  to take Charge of the Ship he told me he had nothing to do with it declaring it was mine and therefore desir'd I would make no more Words about it for said he you don't know but you may meet with something to change your Mind and we may have the Satisfaction of seeing you once more  In a few Days after this the Nuptials were celebrated between  Don Pedro  and  Donna Felicia  who design'd for  Spain  assoon as I left  Italy  where he intended to take up the Mortgage of his Estate the Time being almost expir'd I must own the Uncertainty of Women's Tempers gave me much Cogitation and I thought this Marriage was a very odd Thing  I now began to think of my Journey but first I order'd a Goldsmith to make me every way the same Parcel of Plate as I received as a Present from  Don Jaques de Ramires  which I presented to  Donna Isabella  that she might remember me She gave me many Thanks for it but seem'd very unwilling to accept of it a great while I told her as merrily as I could if she made any more Words about it I would return her the Ship that bore her Name and would be no longer under her Command Well said she I'll accept 'em but as you allow me to be your Owner I'll give you Orders in Writing that you must not break open till you come in such a Latitude that is a Fortnight after you are settled in  England  I promis'd to obey her punctually The next Day she gave me a seal'd Paper which she told me were the Orders she mention'd  I had given my Lieutenant Charge of the Ship with Directions to make for  Bristol  with all the Expedition practicable  The next Day being  Feb  I took my Leave of all my Acquaintance and notwithstanding I am not us'd to weep could not forbear shedding some Tears at parting with such true Friends as  Don Antonio  and his Lady had prov'd I rode the first Day overwhelm'd with Melancholy and not one Thought of being possess'd of such a Fortune from nothing in so short a Time ever enter'd my Breast But seeing  Don Ferdinand  by his Countenance partake of my Sorrow I was forc'd to appear less melancholy to oblige him to be so too  I would have shewn him the Rarities of  Italy  in our Travels but he seem'd very little inclin'd to Curiosity And we arriv'd at  Antwerp  without any Adventure We staid some time there to recover the Fatigue of our Journey but more upon  Don Ferdinand  's Account being he was something indispos'd having never travell'd on Horseback so far before  As we approach'd the Town he and my  Indians  were surpriz'd to see the Manner of Begging The Boys and Girls would run before you and of a sudden stop short stand upon their Heads and clap their Hands saying their Prayers all the while  The City of  Antwerp  is finely seated upon the River  Scheld  it is very well fortify'd and upon the Walls are planted Trees that give an agreeable Shade and make it pleasant Walking The Castle both strong and beautiful was founded by the Duke of  Alva  The City in Bigness may compare with  Bristol  their Streets spacious and Houses very magnificent The Church of  Sancta Maria  their Cathedral is a superb Building  and of that Neatness that the Emperor  Charles  the fifth of  Germany  would often say  it was only fit to be kept in a Case  The Inside is as glorious and neat as the Out The Paintings were perform'd by Sir  Peter Paul Rubens  an Inhabitant of  Antwerp  and are equal to any thing that ever he did The Jesuits Church is also very beautiful adorn'd with abundance of curious Marble Pillars and all the Pannels painted by the same Hand as the other There are several more beautiful Churches and Chappels but as these mention'd are the chief we shall take no farther Notice of 'em  The third of  April  having pretty well recover'd our Fatigue by a Rest of ten Days we set out for  Calais  being the shortest Cut to  Dover  and arriv'd there  April  making short Stages  From this Place we might behold the white Cliffs of  Dover  I must own I had some secret Satisfaction in viewing my native Country and the next Day early in the Morning we embark'd and reach'd the Town by Noon having a very favourable Passage Here landing I had like to have lost one of my  Indians  Slinging his Horses into the Boat he would get upon the Back of one of them thinking he would go out quietly But just upon the Instant a Vessel riding by the  Peer  fired a Gun and frighted the Horse to such a degree that he plung'd into the Sea and swam from the Shore and the  Indian  being thrown off with the Start had his Foot so entangled in the Stirrup that notwithstanding his Skill in Swimming he must have inevitably perish'd if the other  Indian  seeing the Misfortune had not plung'd in and with a Knife cut the String He then took the Horse by the Bridle with one Hand and swimming  with the other brought him safe to Shore  Don Ferdinand  not being overpleas'd with riding on Horseback we took the FlyingCoach the next Day and safely arriv'd at  London  I order'd my  English  Servant and the two  Indians  with our Baggage to make two Days of it and gave 'em Directions to wait at the Place where the Coach inn'd till I sent for 'em  When we arriv'd at  London  I did not care to go to any of my Acquaintance but rather chose to lie at a  Bagnio  for a Day or two but I sent privately for my Uncle's Clerk that had endeavour'd to prevent my being kidnapp'd by putting a Letter in my Pocket mention'd in the Beginning of this Relation He came to me according to my Desire but was overjoy'd and surpriz'd to see me though he hardly knew me at first for I had not sent him my Name  He inform'd me that my Uncle had been dead above a Year and had left his Estate to his eldest Son▪ and his Business to his youngest and him But they would often talk of me not believing I was in the Land of the Living yet they had increas'd my small Estate with their utmost Care intending if ever I came back again to restore it to me I let him into my whole History and he was very much pleas'd to hear that I had gain'd such a plentiful Fortune I got him to provide us convenient Lodgings and private for I did not intend to go abroad much and also to go to the Inn to fetch my Servants  My two  Indians  spoke  English  very well and I had learnt 'em to write and read and being in modern Habits they were not much gaz'd at  The Time being expir'd that I was to look into my Commission as  Donna Isabella  call'd it I resolv'd to break it open having some Curiosity But it was gone and notwithstanding all my Search I could not gain any Tydings of it I could not imagine how I should lose that and nothing else I must own I was very uneasie fearing it might be something of Importance I was to do for  Donna Isabella  therefore I dispatch'd a Letter to  Italy  to tell 'em of my safe Arrival and my Loss of the Packet and to send me a fresh one with Directions where to write to me  While I staid in Town I purchas'd an Estate of  l  a Year in  Somersetshire  and yet had  l  left which I employ'd in the publick Funds And now I had settled my Estate as well as that I had for  Don Ferdinand  I was willing to forward him in his Studies and propos'd to send him to  Oxford  with a Tutor But he still begg'd to stay a little longer with me  I therefore took a Resolution of going to  Bristol  only with  Don Ferdinand  and one Servant with no other Business than to see the Place where my lost Treasure once liv'd  When we were arriv'd I enquir'd which was the House that Mr  Villars  late Merchant formerly dwelt in We soon found it out but were inform'd one Capt  Kendrick  dwelt there I was inquisitive to know if there was any Tydings of one  Susan  who was formerly Maid to Mrs  Villars  Daughter to the deceas'd Merchant and at last got Information that she liv'd at a Country House near the Seaside  I went immediately away for the Place tho' near thirty Mile off and late in the Evening▪ Before we had rid far the Skies became gloomy  and a violent Storm threaten'd us which soon overtook us with such Fury that we were forc'd to put into a little House out of the Road for Shelter When we came within we could not see any Body in't but a little Child playing with some Toys it had before it and all we could get out of it was that  Mamma  would come by and by It was as lovely a Child as ever I saw and we were still admiring it when a Man and Woman came in They were much amaz'd to find us there but I begg'd their Pardon and told 'em the Storm drove us in to take Shelter  The Man told us we were very welcome to such as his House afforded but he fear'd we should find but poor Accommodation In short the Storm kept up in its full Force and now it grew dark and we were two Mile from any Inn and to add to our Distress we were Strangers to the Road The Man seeing us so put to it told us he had but two Beds but we should be welcome to 'em such as they were  I told him I would gratifie him for his Trouble and thereupon gave him a Guinea He was very well pleas'd with my Present and began to shew it in his Looks as well as the Woman I gave him another to provide us something to eat and to take care of the Horses He said he had but bad Stableroom but if I pleas'd he would take my Servant and all the Horses with one of his own to bring him back again and leave 'em at an Inn in the neighbouring Village I agreed to it and while he was gone I ask'd the good Woman many Questions about the Child which we saw there and soon sound it was none of their own but a Gentlewoman's a Stranger to them and one they had never seen but once Why said I  how are you paid for the keeping of it She seem'd amaz'd at my Question and was some time before she answer'd me but at last she said she was always very well paid  I finding she did not much care for talking upon that Subject chang'd the Discourse Soon after the Man came in and we went to Supper I would have had  Don Ferdinand  to have lain with me but the Man understanding we usually lay asunder would give us both the Beds and they would sit up I ask'd them where the Child lay and they told us in a Cradle I began to be concerned for the Infant though without giving any Reason When we had supp'd we went to Bed and had but little Rest and when we rose in the Morning it proving fair and pleasant we resolved to walk to the Inn where our Horses were with our Host for our Guide When we arriv'd I dismiss'd him with another Guinea and would have got immediately on Horseback but  Don Ferdinand  was so very much disorder'd that he was not able to mount I was very much concern'd for his Indisposition and begg'd he would repose himself there while I pursu'd my Journey with a Promise to return the next Day or send my Servant for him He consented that it should be so and I set forward  Coming to a Place where several Roads met I was confounded to know the right and therefore was some time at a Stand not knowing which to take But hearing several Voices in an adjacent Barn I made up to it on Foot giving my Horse to my Man The nearer I approach'd the more Noise they made but I could not understand 'em This awaken'd my Curiosity and I stole softly to the Barn where I could observe through a Crevice unseen upwards wards  of twenty Gypsies sitting in a Huddle with a Child in the midst stark naked which they were rubbing over with WalnutShells and every time it cry'd they set up that confus'd Noise But I was very much surpriz'd to find in that Child the Features of that I had seen the Night before at my Country Landlord's I beckon'd my Servant to come near with my Horses being arm'd I made to the Barn Door and forc'd it open I ask'd 'em in an imperious Manner what they were doing with that Child and further affirm'd they had stole it from such a Place giving them to understand I had People coming to apprehend 'em Upon hearing this they all took to their Heels and some I found that had come there with Crutches ran very nimbly away without 'em but the Child was left behind I now began to consider with my self what I had done and that I had gotten a Child but did not know what to do with it They had rubb'd the poor thing all over with the green WalnutShells that made it look like one of their Fraternity By good Fortune they had left his Cloaths behind 'em as also some Rags which I suppose were to be put on instead of the others  My man and I dress'd it as well as we could and aukwardly enough but when we had finish'd notwithstanding my Haste I resolv'd to go back again and enquire into this Affair When we came to the Inn I gave the Infant to the Care of the Woman of the House till my Return and understanding  Don Ferdinand  was gone to Rest I proceeded to my Host's House without disturbing him When we arriv'd there I met the Woman at the Door Pray said I to her good Woman where's the Child that I saw here last Night Where's the Child return'd  the Woman snappingly why the Child's in his Cradle asleep Let me see it said I No said she I won't disturb it for you nor no one else I told her peremptorily I would see it that Instant in spight of her for I fear'd some foul Play She seeing me resolute and lighting from my Horse Well Sir seeing you are so desirous said she I'll go and bring it to you When she was gone I began to imagine my self mistaken and that Children might be very like without being the same but I knew a Guinea would soon reconcile her to my Rudeness I staid waiting a considerable time taken up with several Thoughts and not observing how long I had waited till my Man told me the old Woman was long a coming I began to call and no body answering I order'd him to go in and see for her He came out again and told me she was not in the House nor any one else but that he believ'd she had slip'd out of the back Door and got away through the Garden I began to think there was something very extraordinary in the Adventure of the Child and resolv'd to be strict in the Examination I enter'd the House my self and search'd but to no Purpose I sent my Man in the mean time in pursuit of the Woman But he return'd without her There was never a Neighbouringhouse to enquire no nearer than the Village where I had left the Child So I had just got on Horseback in order to go back when I perceiv'd the Man coming towards his own House I spur'd on to meet him and he seem'd much concern'd I seiz'd him by the Collar and told him I came to secure him for the Murder of the Child I saw at his House last Night The Man was in such a terrible Fright at what I said that he was more dead than alive▪ Sure Sir said he it can't be it is not  murder'd I bid him produce it or he should be try'd for it In short I frighted the poor Fellow so much that he told me if I would have a little Patience he would tell me all that he knew concerning it still crying I hope it is not murder'd I told him the Child was safe We went back to his House where after the Fellow had a little compos'd himself he made me the following Relation  About three Years ago a Gentlewoman came to my Wife and made a Bargain with her to keep this Infant and by paying us handsomely we imagin'd it belong'd to some Person of Distinction for we receiv'd ten Pounds every Quarter and that before it was due The Lady would often take the Child for a Day or two and return it again My Wife being a worldly Woman laid several Plots how to know the truth of the Child but to no Purpose but by all Circumstances we believ'd the Parents did not care for owning it One Day my Wife told me she had a Design in her Head but she would not disclose it till she could be sure of succeeding and when the Lady came the next time to take the Child away for a Day as usual my Wife was in Conference with her for some time And when she was gone she told me that she had prevail'd upon the Lady to pay her one hundred Pounds before hand and that she brought her to it by telling her we should make a Purchase of the House we live in In short my Wife who wears the Breeches made me consent to carry on the Deceit and the next Day the Lady brought the Child and the hundred Pound and gave it my Wife without any thing under my Hand and left us in a small time after When she was gone my Wife discours'd me after this manner  Husband we have now one hundred and fifty Pounds for we had been very saving besides our Goods and Cattle which will fetch us one hundred more With this Money we may go into my Country which was the  Isle of Man  and live contentedly all our Lives without any fears of bad Crops and ill Markets Well but said I what will become of the Child I quickly found by her Expressions that she resolv'd to murder it I was struck with Horror at her Proposition and notwithstanding her violent Temper oppos'd her in't and told her upon no Conditions would I consent to do so barbarous a Deed I found her so fix'd upon the design of Murder that I was at last as the lightest Evil obliged to consent to her selling it to a Company of  Gypsies  but with the greatest Reluctance in the World which was executed this Morning But we had dispos'd of every thing before hand with Intention to have gone for  Bristol  two Days hence for we were assur'd the Lady would not come again for some time  When he had done I inform'd him how I came to meet with the Child I then began to examine if he did not know where the Lady liv'd and at last he confess'd he dogg'd her to her House one Day set on by his Wife but would never discover it to her for fear of her playing some Trick I prevail'd with him to go with me and shew me the House with the promise of a Reward and letting him go afterwards We set out after he had got a Horse and in two Hours arriv'd at a pleasant House surrounded by a small River and almost cover'd with Trees I stopp'd some time to view it and through a little Avenue saw two Women gathering Flowers one had her Face turn'd towards us which the Man said was the Woman that  us'd to come to see the Child and that was the Place she carry'd it to I order'd my Man to take the Horses to the next Town about half a Mile off and come to me again But I needed not have bid mine Host to have gone about his Business for he being fearful of the Event got away without our perceiving it  When my Man was gone I walk'd about to view the House but I had lost sight of the Women and it began to rain again I stood up for Shelter from the Weather under a large Oak and had but just got there when a Woman came out of the Gate with her Mistress's Service to invite me in I was very well pleas'd with the Invitation and went into the House where I was met by the Gentlewoman a very handsome Lady She told me as I look'd like a Gentleman she desir'd I would take Shelter there till the Storm was over I return'd her the Thanks her Civility deserv'd and we sat down but were immediately interrupted with ringing at the Gate and I perceiv'd through a small Window a Gentleman in a Scarletcloak alight from his Horse and go in quite through the House The Lady begg'd my Pardon and told me she was obliged to go keep another Lady Company while that Person was there but would wait on me assoon as possible again As my Curiosity had brought me there I had no Thoughts of going away till I had satisfy'd it in some measure I could hear the Man's Voice very plain who seem'd to threaten a Lady with a great many Hardships as to her Fortune if she would not consent to his Love The Lady answer'd in so low a Voice that I could not hear what she said but I found her Answers did but inrage him the more They talk'd a great while and at last they seem'd to be silent I hearing the Door open  step'd back into the Room where the Lady left me She came to me again and sat down I hope Sir said she you'll pardon my Rudeness but I could not wait on you before Madam return'd I I ought to beg your Pardon for taking Possession of your House here who am an utter Stranger to you We were interrupted in our Compliments by the Voice of a Person that scream'd out Murder MurderWe both ran out and she coming to the Door where the Noise was we found it shut and the Voice still calling out for Help I burst it open with my Foot and with my Sword in my Hand ran into the Room where I found the Gentleman that came in the Cloak endeavouring to force a Lady I gave him a Stroke upon the Head and bid him turn about and defend himself which he did with many bitter Exclamations But after several Passes I had the good Fortune to disarm him and he having receiv'd several Wounds drop'd down with loss of Blood The Lady he had attempted was still in a Swoon and the Bustle had brought several Women Servants into the Room I retir'd into the Chamber I came from but desir'd the Lady to take some care of the Wretch who deserv'd Death but I wish'd might survive to prevent farther Trouble She took my Advice and sent to the next Town for a Surgeon who soon came and my Man along with him by Accident Perceiving his Wounds were not dangerous for I stood by while the Surgeon dress'd him and finding the House in too much Confusion to be better inform'd concerning the Child I was about to take my Leave But the Lady I had so timely rescu'd having recover'd her Fright desir'd she might thank me for so great a Providence I was easily persuaded to stay and immediately a Lady came into the  Room But good God what Transports did I feel when in that Lady I beheld every Feature of my dear Mrs  Villars  Our Eyes were fix'd upon each other and the Sight of me rais'd such a tumult of Joy in her Breast that combating with her unsettled Heart she fell down in a Swoon again The other Lady at first knew not the Meaning of our Disorder But when I call'd her my dear Wife and other extravagant Expressions of my Love she soon guess'd the Truth and seem'd as much transported as we were Words would but wrong the Sentiments we felt for each other Therefore let the Reader if possible guess the Joy of two Lovers meeting after imagining each other no longer in this World We thought it was all a Dream but at last being convinc'd of the Reality we sent privately for the Parson and were ty'd by the outward Ceremony of the Church whose Hearts had been divinely united long before and that Night I took once more Possession of what I valu'd above all the World could give  The next Day I sent for  Don Ferdinand  to partake in our Joy but was inform'd his Indisposition had increas'd upon him so much that it was dangerous to remove him This was some allay to my Joy for I had a real Friendship for him I told my dear Wife the Obligation I had to his Father I now desir'd to know the Particulars of her wonderful Escape which she related to me after the following manner  You know said she when we parted at  Mequinez  our Hearts foreboded something would follow prejudicial to our Loves I was not acquainted with  Mustapha  's Escape if I had it is very probable I might have avoided the Misfortune that befell me But he got a Vessel to carry him to  Sallee  as he inform'd me when I was  their Prisoner again and by the Way met with his Master  Hamet  who wrote a Letter to the Governor of  Mammora  and sent  Mustapha  with it while he intended to wait near the Coast to guard us back When they had seiz'd me they hurry'd me away immediately on board a Vessel and sail'd upon the Instant and before Night met with  Hamet  where I was carry'd on Board He upbraided me in Terms that gave me to expect worse Treatment from him but I told him rather than submit to his nauseous Love I would starve my self to Death if I could find no other means to rid me of Life The next Day a Storm arising of a sudden blew down one of their Masts and drove 'em back again within Sight of the Port of  Mammora  but to avoid it they ran beyond it and the Storm continu'd In the Evening it began to abate and he steer'd his Course back again but before it was dark a Ship appear'd in View And notwithstanding he had lost several Men in a former Engagement he resolv'd to set upon this Vessel and it growing Calm he got up to her with rowing The other Vessel knowing what she was began with us first and fir'd very briskly  The Fight continu'd about an Hour as near as I could guess for all my Employment was to pray that some lucky Shot would end that Life which was so burthensome to me When the Noise of the Ordnance ceas'd I had not Curiosity enough to go to see how Affairs stood But judge my Surprize and Pleasure when I tell you the first Man that enter'd the Cabin was the Mate that I had made Captain as I mention'd to you in the Relation of my first Misfortune  How Madam cry'd he is it you thank Heav'n my Voyage is at End Come Madam continu'd he I'll carry you to one that thinks  her Life a Burden till you are safe being your Danger is owing to her I had not Power to return him an Answer or ask him who it was he meant I was so confounded with Thought He carry'd me on board of his own Ship where he brought Mrs  Susan  to me My Heart was so full of Content that for a Moment you had slipt out of my Memory  The Ship of  Hamet  's was just sinking for they had shot her between Wind and Water and could not come to stop it They had taken out as many of their Goods as the time would permit and all the Men that were wounded before she Sunk I let 'em into your Story and the mutual Affection we had and in Return the Captain gave me the following Account of their getting away from  Sallee  You know Madam said he the  Moors  were not very strict in searching us and I had at the first Sight of 'em judging what they were secur'd all the Merchants Money design'd for Trade as well as what I had of my own about my Cloaths and in a great Fur Cap which I wore upon my Head  Hamet  being satisfy'd with you and what he found besides would not sell us for Slaves but gave us the Liberty of walking about the Town with a small Allowance of Provision till we could send a Person to  England  for a thousand Pounds which was the Ransom of both Ship and Men In a little time I became acquainted with one of the  Jews  of  Sallee  whom I prevail'd upon by the force of Money to buy the Ship and pay for our Ransom which he did without any one's concerning themselves about it We did all we could to find you out but to no purpose so we were obliged to set Sail for  England  In our Voyage home Mrs  Susan  inform'd we with your Story not concealing even her own Part in't and I found her so sincere in her Repentance that I could not help pitying her which soon rose a softer Passion and assoon as we arriv'd in  England  the Ceremony of the Church compleated my Happiness We acquainted Mr  Kendrick  your Ladyship's Guardian and Steward with your Misfortune who with the Advice of us fitted the Ship out in your Name with a sufficient Quantity of Money for your Ransom if it were possible for us to hear of you and by meeting with you now we have compass'd what we intended I return'd 'em many Thanks especially Mrs  Susan  who would accompany her Husband in hopes to meet with me I desir'd Captain  Morrice  which is the Name of Mrs  Susan  's Husband to steer towards  Mammora  but he told me it was not safe For as there was a War proclaim'd between  France  and  England  the Ambassador could not answer it if he did not make us Prize and we were further inform'd by one of the  Renegado  Prisoners that he was very well assur'd they were sail'd for  France  Upon this Notice we directed our Course with this Hope that you would soon arrive in  England  and find me out for I remember'd in the Story of my Misfortunes I gave you Marks enough to let you know where I was to be found Before we made the  English  Coast I found my self with Child and the very Imagination had like to have cost me my Life for fear the Father of the unborn Infant would not come time enough to save my Credit for though I was well assur'd of your Honour yet I knew the censuring World would be apt to blame my Conduct I  could hide nothing from the faithful  Susan  who join'd her Fears with mine  When we came into  Bristol  Channel I consulted with  Susan  about my Management and I at last resolv'd to live Private till I could hear some News of you But I was obliged to let Mr  Kenderick  my Steward into the Knowledge of my Arrival tho' he was a Stranger to my Condition  I sent to  London  in hopes of hearing some News of you but having kept the Name of your Uncle a Secret in your Relation our Endeavours prov'd fruitless  My Melancholy encreas'd with my Condition and for fear of a Discovery I went into  Wales  with a Relation of Mrs  Susan  's and was deliver'd of a Boy that prov'd the greatest Comfort to my sinking Heart for in his Face was every Feature of his dear Father I brought him back again here and had him put to Nurse as a Child to a Relation of Mrs  Susan  's and had resolv'd but this very Day to have sent for him home that I might always have the Satisfaction of having him in my Sight  My Steward finding I was under a Necessity of living Private began to talk to me of Love and often proceeded so far after finding I disdain'd his Passion to tell me if I would not consent to make him my Husband he would take care my Estate should come into his Hands Though I could have soon broke his Designs as to my Fortune yet my solitary Dwelling pleas'd me so well that I gave him good Words which did but more encourage his Insolence till it arriv'd to that Pitch you so happily deliver'd me from  I soon found by my Wife's Relation that the Infant I had so marvellously sav'd was our own Child When I related the Accident of meeting with the Child my Wife express'd so much Feat▪ Terror Tenderness and Joy that I thought the different Passions would have taken away her Understanding By this we may learn there is a ruling Providence that regulates every Action of our Lives when they tend to Virtue  Mr  Kendrick  the Person that made the Attempt upon my Wife was soon inform'd of our happy Meeting and his Wounds mending every Day he begg'd we would favour him with a Visit which we comply'd with where he ask'd Pardon for all past Offences in such a sincere Manner that we were easily prevail'd upon to forgive him  He sent for all the Books of Accounts and Writings that belong'd to my Wife's Estate and deliver'd 'em up to us  The same Day Captain  Morrice  arriv'd from  France  where he went by the Desire of my Wife as her last Hope to know if he could gain any Intelligence of me He was so very diligent in his Commission that he got to the Speech of Monsieur  de St Olon  who inform'd him of my pursuing the Vessel and returning and of my Voyage to  Italy  I rewarded him by several handsome Presents for his Trouble and found in all his Actions a downright blunt sincere Honesty which drew me into a Friendship for him I now began to think of  Don Ferdinand  's Illness and resolv'd to go with my Wife to make him a Visit and my dear Wife was so impatient to embrace the Child she would not let me stay to finish my Affairs with Mr  Kendrick  As we were upon our Journey we were met by a Relation of mine Son to that barbarous  Uncle that had Kidnap'd me He was in the Country when I arriv'd at  London  Notwithstanding the Injury I had suffer'd from his Father I could not help receiving him with the utmost Affection for we were both of an Age and very like as to our Persons being brought up together till the Death of my Father which created a Friendship for each other  He brought me a Packet from  Italy  and in it one inclos'd from  Don Jaques  sent from St  Salvaldor  I broke open that first which was as follows  I  Hope the Distance of Climates has had no Force upon your Friendship mine here has rather receiv'd an Addition tho' I am overwhelm'd with a very great Misfortune My Daughter in whom all my Hopes center'd is I fear intirely lost for the very Day you left us was the last time my Eyes beheld her We have some reason to fear the Relations of the Person who dy'd by your Sword have us'd some clandestine Means and perhaps have privately murder'd her to be reveng'd on us for that Accident tho' of their own seeking In short I am weary of the hateful Place and shall do my Endeavour to seek Repose in some other Part of the World and relying upon your goodnatur'd Friendship I hope to have the Honour very shortly after your receiving this to ▪embrace you in  England  for I am preparing to leave St  Salvador  with the soonest I receiv'd your obliging Letter and the Bales of Goods all in good Condition But there is something Dark in it or at least my Understanding can't reach this Paragraph  and be assur'd whatever you gave me in Charge  c I sent you nothing but what I hope you will accept as your own and I took the manner of leaving 'em with you knowing your generous Temper would  not have been easily persuaded to have accepted 'em from one that shall ever subscribe himself  Your sincere Friend and Servant Jaques de Ramires  P S  My Wife who is inconsolable throws in her Love and Service and all the Hopes she has left is the Expectation of telling you Face to Face the Grief she lies under at her fatal Loss and to bring us farther in your Debt we beg you will leave us sufficient Direction among our Countrymen at your  Exchange  where we may find you  I was very much concern'd at my Friend's Misfortune especially in believing I was in some sort the mistaken Cause of it I had inform'd my Wife of the Adventure before and she condol'd with me and the Thoughts of being so near the same Distress in her own Child redoubled her Grief When we had given up some time to those Melancholy Reflections I broke open the following Letter from  Don Antonio  My Dear Friend  WE received yours with the utmost Transports but as I am an  Italian  I ought to be jealous at the Joy my Wife express'd when she read it and much more when she now declares that she will come to  England  to reproach you for the little Care you took of her Commission She will farther to encrease my Jealousy write you her Sentiments her self but let her say what she will there I am resolv'd to esteem you as the only Friend that's dear to  Antonio de Alvares  The other Letter from  Isabella  contain'd these Words  SIR  I'LL suspend my Reproaches till I see you which I hope will be soon I had no Commission to be executed in those Papers you lost but that of having clear'd the Aspersion you cast on our Sex of Inconstancy which you had some Grounds for in the sudden Marriage of  Don Pedro  and  Donna Felicia  after her violent Passion for  Don Ferdinand  When I found the Cause of her Distemper I as having felt the keenest Dart of Love pity'd her Pain and therefore tax'd  Don Ferdinand  often with his wearing an obdurate Heart in his Bosom I press'd him so often that he desir'd to meet  Donna Felicia  and my self in my Closet We came according to Appointment where he spoke to this Effect  Madam tax me no more with Hardness of Heart for if I had not a very tender one I had never arriv'd here and to discover my Frailty at once know I am a Woman  And upon that undiscovering her Bosom gave us Evident Tokens We were both so very much surpriz'd that she went on with her Discourse  I beg Ladies you will never open your Mouth to my Captain concerning this for the Moment I am sensible he knows my Weakness shall be the last of my Life  But notwithstanding this Injunction I can't help informing you in Pity to her and I am well assur'd as your Passion is hopeless you have Humanity enough not to destroy one who dies for you and nothing in this World can equal my Joy if I find when I arrive  Don Ferdinand  the Wife to one who shall ever have the Friendship of  Isabella de Alvares  What Words can express the Amazement I felt at the reading this last Letter My Thoughts were confounded in Thought and a Chaos of Ideas possess'd my Brain I was in so much Confusion that I thought of returning home again to consider of this strange Turn Recollected Circumstances convinc'd me how blind I was in not discovering it sooner My Soul was immediately fill'd with the most tender Pity and I had not the use of Words to declare my Sentiments to my Wife and Cousin Sometimes I would imagine it was all a fictitious Dream yet at last I was not displeas'd that I had it in my Power to restore to  Don Jaques  his long lost Daughter My Wife was as much concern'd as I was and my Cousin could hardly believe it I soon found that she had taken care the Packet should not fall into my Hands and that convinc'd me she would not have her Disguise discover'd The next Day we resolv'd to visit her and form my Resolution from my Observation  When we arriv'd at the Inn we found her dress'd at a Table with Paper Pens and Ink before her but very weak I presented my Wife and Cousin to her She saluted 'em and seem'd mightily pleas'd with my good Fortune and was very much concern'd her Indisposition would not admit her waiting on me to partake in my Contentment Her Weakness was so prevalent that she could hardly utter her Words She knew nothing of receiving the Packet from my Cousin but after we had sat some time I gave her the Letter from her Father which assoon as she had read she fell backward upon the Bed in a Swoon  The Noise we made at this Accident brought several People into the Room and among the rest my Landlady who it seems had fell desperately in Love with her as imagining her to be a Man She made such aukward Complainings that if our Minds had been at ease would have produc'd much Mirth but among her Actions she unbutton'd her Cloaths to give her Breath and soon discover'd her Mistake in the Object of her Wishes When she found by her Breasts that she was a Woman she ran down Stairs with the utmost Precipitation and left us alone to recover her When we had brought her to her Senses again she soon found that we had discover'd her Sex and the Grief and Shame at the Accident had like to have thrown her again into her Swooning It was some time before we could bring her to her self But she found by my Discourse that I understood the whole Secret  After a long Pause said she I did not intend to let my Frailty be known to you till after my Death but since it is discover'd I beg you will have some Regard to my Memory and I shall die contented I begg'd her not to talk of Death but live to comfort her griev'd Parents It is too late said she to talk of any Comfort for I have call'd my greatest Friend Death to my Aid who is just now arriv'd Upon uttering these Words a deadly Paleness possess'd her Face and Trembling seiz'd her Limbs She had just Strength enough to declare to us that she had taken a Dose of Poison provided for the Occasion bought of an Apothecary of the Town and that she was just going to write a Letter to me but was prevented by our sudden Appearance whose Contents were only to see her secretly bury'd and if possible to have conceal'd her Sex and Story from the World She had hardly made an End before  her Speech forsook her and Life in all Appearance fled the beauteous Dwelling My Wife was not present at this Accident being her eager Desire had carry'd her to her Child but she came in before it was over My Cousin seem'd more oppress'd with Grief than any of us for Love had taken full Possesson of his Heart  While Sorrow had lock'd up all our Tongues the Apothecary came in in a strange Confusion for the Report had soon dispers'd it self all over that little Village Sir said he to me don't be concern'd at the Condition you see the Gentleman in for he is not dead he has only took a sleeping Potion I partly guess'd his Design when he apply'd to me for Poison and the extraordinary Price he paid for it convinc'd me it was for some sinister Design and therefore I happily impos'd upon him  This News reviv'd us all again especially my Cousin who I thought would have gone distracted for Joy and to see his impatient watching for her Life's return if we may call it so only gave me further Proof that one Look is sufficient to fix Love for ever in the Soul The Apothecary during this interval of Life and Death pour'd Cordials into her Mouth to help the Operation and at last she open'd her unwilling Eyes and gaz'd around her as if she had been in another World But we soon convinc'd her of the Apothecary's Deceit at which she seem'd in the utmost Confusion and gave us to understand that Life was forc'd upon her against her Inclination and she would shake it off  We gave her all the Comfort we were capable of and my Wife told her if she talk'd any longer of Death it was only that she could not bear to see us happy This as it were rous'd her from her Lethargy Well then said she I will  live if it be only to convince you that I am pleas'd to see my Captain bless'd for she would always call me so After we had a little compos'd her we left her with my Cousin to look after our Child who was in the same Place which had prov'd the secret Instinct of Nature for at the first Sight in the House of his unnatural Nurse I could not help feeling a tender Regard for him When we had satisfy'd our Inn we prevail'd upon  Donna Bianca  now no longer  Ferdinand  to come into the Coach with us and we arriv'd that Evening at  Bristol  where we took Possession of the House which Captain  Kendrick  had liv'd in that belong'd to my Wife We staid some time there to settle my Wife's Affairs and as much to recover  Donna Bianca  's Indisposition  My Cousin by his Assiduity gain'd very much of her Esteem but she freely declar'd she had no Room in her Heart for Love But notwithstanding with much Importunity we prevail'd upon her to accept him for a Husband and her Esteem soon came up to a more tender Passion Assoon as the Ceremony was over we took a Journey to  London  to settle our Affairs there and provide for my expected Guests  One Morning as we were pursuing our Journey coming near the Skirts of a Wood we heard several Groans which alarm'd us but as we had too many People about us arm'd to sear any thing we came out of the Coach to know the Reason Where we found a Woman weltring in Blood being stabb'd in several Places with a Sword When I came to take a nearer View I found it was my former Master the Watchmaker's Wife I could not help having Compassion for any Person in that Condition therefore order'd her to be taken up and  put in the Coach  Donna Bianca  open'd her Breast and stopp'd her Wounds as well as she could till we could get a Surgeon that I had order'd to be sent for She soon knew me and cry'd out Sure Heaven has sent you that know my Guilt to be Witness of my Repentance The Wrongs I have done my Husband have pursu'd me to my Grave When I had robb'd him of all I could lay my Hands on I made my Escape to  Ireland  chang'd my Name and set up for a greater Fortune than I really was I had many Suitors but Heaven to punish me made me place my Affections on a Person that courted me for my Money And tho' I soon understood he had but very little Estate yet Love prevail'd with me to make him my Husband He soon spent both his own and my Fortune and by contracting many Debts was forc'd to fly for  England  and finding no Relief took to the Highway where he has committed many Robberies He lodg'd me in a neighbouring Village but our Place of Meeting was generally in this Wood for fear of a Discovery This Morning he came according to Appointment where he began his Discourse after this Manner I had no Inclination for you when I first marry'd you but now I utterly abhor you therefore am resolv'd to part with you But I have another Reason besides my Hatred to you which is this I have it in my Power to marry an old Woman very rich and therefore it is necessary to send you out of the World for fear our Marriage should come to her Ears and spoil my Fortune He follow'd his Discourse with these Wounds which he gave me and rode into the Wood without my once offering to open my Mouth for Astonishment had ty'd up my Tongue I told her I hop'd  Heaven had given her all its Punishment in this World That's all the Hope I have said she and in my unfeigned Repentance for I feel Death approaching We observ'd she was just expiring and before the Surgeon came she gave up her last Breath calling upon Heaven for Mercy I gave Orders for her Funeral and sent after her Murderer but to no Purpose But I heard he was taken for the Highway some time after and executed at  Worcester  where he confess'd the Murder of his Wife Thus we see the Hand of Heaven though slow in Punishments yet always overtakes the Guilty When I had given Directions for her Funeral we pursu'd our Journey and arriv'd safe at  London  Don Antonio  and his Lady arriv'd first in a private Capacity not caring to make a Show according to their Birth to be taken Notice of And in a few Days after came  Don Jaques  and his Lady in a Ship of their own in Company with the  Isabella  which my Lieutenant commanded that had sprung a Leak which oblig'd her to put into  Lisbon  to refit where  Don Jaques  joyfully met with her  I had desir'd  Donna Bianca  once more to put on her Boy's Cloaths for I intended agreeably to surprize her Parents  I was oblig'd to take Lodgings for  Don Jaques  's Family being they intended to take a convenient House in the City Assoon as mutual Caresses were over Grief again took Possession of their Souls for the Loss of their Child After condoling with 'em some time I begg'd 'em to hope for the best and that it was possible to hear of her again They shook their Heads and told me that Thought was long given  over and they had no Hope but in Time to wear away their unhappy Loss  I told 'em I had a Kinsman as much as I could remember the Features of their beautiful Daughter as like her as a Man could be like a Woman They express'd a great Desire to see him I told 'em I had invited him with another Relation to sup with us on purpose We had taken care before that  Donna Bianca  should Ombre her Face and speak nothing but  English  on purpose to carry on the Deceit 'Till the time of their coming we spent in relating our Accidents in the Voyage I told 'em how much I was surpriz'd at the Likeness of my Cousin to their Daughter for I had given 'em to understand it was a Relation I had never seen before I left  England  which was Truth  When the Time I had appointed came  Donna Bianca  and my Cousin enter'd I presented 'em to  Don Jaques  and his Wife as my Relations and they saluted 'em as utter Strangers But when they saw and heard  Donna Bianca  they burst into Tears at the great Resemblance in both Voice and Features as they said to their Daughter She carry'd it on as long as she could speaking  English  all the while but at last their Tears prevail'd so much upon her Tenderness that she begg'd leave to retire but would return immediately I made an Apology for my Kinsman to  Don Jaques  and his Wife and told 'em he would return in a very little time The Space of their Absence was fill'd with Sighs and Tears and as I knew their Grief would soon be over I never attempted to comfort 'em  When they were ready they sent a Servant to tell me a Gentleman wanted to speak with  me I retir'd and came in again immediately and told 'em our Company would be encreas'd for another Relation and his Wife were just coming in to sup with us and upon the Instant my Cousin enter'd leading by the Hand  Donna Bianca  They both ran and kneel'd down before  Don Jaques  and his Wife At the Sight of their Daughter the Mother fell backward in the Chair in a Swoon and  Don Jaques  was in such a Surprize that he could not open his Mouth but express'd his Joy by Tears Kisses and Embraces and his Lady coming to her self had like to have stifled her with her Transports  They did not ask any reasonable Questions till the Torrent of their Joy was poured out After the first Transports were over  Donna Bianca  told her own Story She said the first time I din'd at their House in St  Salvador  Love flew into her Heart and knowing the Modesty due to her Sex she was resolv'd never to discover it till she found the State of mine Yet finding her Passion daily increase and understanding the Day of my Departure she procured secretly the Habit of a Man with all other Necessaries and convey'd herself on Board in the Boat that carry'd the Presents her Father had sent me and counterfeited the Letter she gave me as from her Father Every thing answered my Wish said she but I soon found my Captain had no Heart to bestow It is needless to tell how many bitter Sighs and Tears that Knowledge cost me But it is now buried in Oblivion Then she proceeded to beg their Pardon for her rash Folly as she call'd it and they were too much overjoy'd not to forgive her every thing and they exprest a great deal  of Satisfaction in that they could now call me their Relation We liv'd in all the Contentment imaginable returning Heaven our grateful Thanks for its bounteous Mercy And now I am settled I'll take Leave of my Reader with this Couplet of the Poet  O never let a virtuous Mind despair  For constant Hearts are Love's peculiar Care  THE VOYAGE SHIPWRACK AND Miraculous ESCAPE OF  Richard Castelman  Gent With a Description of  Pensylvania  and the City  Philadelphia  c  Printed in the Year MDCCXXVI  THE VOYAGE c OF  Richard Castelman  Gent  _THE Dangers at Sea are certainly more imminent than those on Shore even in the fairest Weather the Space is very small betwen this World and the next  A  Grecian  Philosopher was in my Opinion much in the right when ask'd by a Friend if he would go to a neighbouring Island in the  Hellespont  to hunt answer'd if he should be guilty of so much Folly he should have no other Hope but of returning safe back for those that trusted their Lives to the Sea ventur'd with a changing Mistress  I embark'd on Board Captain  Cox  bound for  Charlestown  in  Carolina  with Mr  Jones  and his Family and arriv'd safe there without any  great Hazard just when Captain  Moor  had made a Descent upon the  Spaniards  of St  Augustine  a Plantation to the Southward of  Carolina  and return'd with considerable Booty By some of the  Colony  his Proceedings were censur'd with Injustice being the  Spaniards  had not any Notice of the Rupture between  England  and  Spain  but all Stratagems are lawful in War  Some time after the  Spaniards  resenting the Usage of the  English  fitted out five Sail of Men of War and several Transports to repay them in their own Coin  They landed eight hundred Men in the Bay and sent two Trumpeters to Sir  Nathaniel Johnson  at that time Governour of  Charlestown  to surrender but he sent 'em word back as the Place was intrusted to him by the Queen his Mistress he was resolv'd to hold it out to the last The Messengers inform'd their Admiral of Sir  Nathaniel  's Resolution and likewise added that the Town was too well Mann'd to be easily taken He thought better on't recall'd his Men and sail'd away  This Attempt very much alarm'd the Country and put 'em upon fortifying  Charlestown  which at present may laugh at all Attempts from a Foreign Foe or the native  Indians  who us'd before to infest 'em daily  Charlestown  or  Charles  City the Capital of  Carolina  is situated upon a Neck of Land form'd by a River on each side nam'd  Ashley  and  Cooper  Rivers from the first Plantations well stor'd with Fish There was when I was there but an indifferent wooden Church but before I left the Place Subscriptions were taken in to build a regular Stone Building There are upwards of a thousand Houses very neatly built with Gardens almost to every House There is Plenty of every Thing for the Life of Man to be  found at  Charlestown  It lies in deg min Northern Latitude The Trade of this Place is more considerable for its Bigness than any other Plantation in  America  it being the Southermost Settlement belonging to the Crown of  England  upon the Continent and I have been inform'd they have Dealings three hundred Leagues up the Country which is very much facilitated by the numerous navigable Rivers that come from the Mountains The Climate is very wholesome Tho' most  Europeans  have at their first Arrival the Distemper of the Country which proceeds from Change of Air and Diet yet I had the good Fortune to escape with a swell'd Arm which had like to have ended in the Mortification of a Finger but I was happily cur'd by the Care and Advice of Madam  Rhett  the only good Surgeon on the Place Tho' were I to enumerate her other good Qualities my small Tract would exceed in Bulk my Intentions I shall only say another  Dacter  may be found in  America  I staid at  Charlestown  upwards of eight Months and was well entertain'd by the courteous Inhabitants for I must own Pleasure as well as Profit induc'd me to travel though I have no Inclination that way now  Mr  Jones  the Person concern'd with me in Trade was oblig'd to go to  Bermuda  being Secretary and ProvostMarshal of the  SummerIslands  and in a short time after I follow'd with his Family We met with no other Accident than a large Shark that follow'd our Vessel several Days together and the Master told me he was well assur'd some One on Board would die I laugh'd at his Superstition and endeavour'd to rally him out of it but he still persisted in his Opinion When the Shark appear'd first  every Body was in good Health but in three Days time a Woman Passenger expir'd of a Fever whom we committed to the Waves and was probably entombed in the Bowels of the Shark for he took his leave of us the same Day The Master told me he had made it his Observation for several Years and was never once out 'Tis not impossible but the Shark at Sea has the same Instinct as the Vulture at Land  When I arriv'd at St  George  's the Capital of  Bermudas  I was as well pleas'd with the Climate and Inhabitants as I was at  Carolina  St  George  's Town is seated in the Bottom of a Bay of the same Name and is very well fortify'd It contains about two hundred Houses with a Church something handsomer than that of  Charlestown  The Incumbent was the Reverend Mr  Holland  a Person of a good Understanding I had a Present an  Antelope  's Foot set in Gold for a TobaccoStopper which I was to deliver to the Bishop of  Bangor  his Patron but it was lost among my other Things in my Shipwrack  There is a perpetual Spring to be observ'd in these Islands and the old Leaves never drop before they are thrust out by new ones Their Fruit is in Blossoms Buds and Ripe at the same time The Air is generally temperate and innubilous but now and then troubled with violent Thunder and Lightning and I have been shown several Rocks that they say were split by Lightning  I was informed by a Gentleman that had coasted along these Islands that their Number amounts to but above of them deserve no other Name than Rocks and most of the others that are inhabited have not above half a dozen Houses upon them  The Soil of all the cultivated Islands is alike being very fruitful and some People imagine they were once join'd making one intire Island but were divided as they are now by the Innovation of the Sea And what gives them ground for this Opinion is that the Waves daily lessen the small ones But this is only Conjecture  I am sorry to say that the former Inhabitants gain'd much by Pirates and even some that had large Plantations when I was there were little better at first than SeaRobbers  The late Queen being inform'd of it order'd Mr  Larkins  with a Commission to try Pirates whereever they resorted in her Dominions in  America  I happen'd to be at  Bermuda  when he arriv'd there He acquainted the People in Power with his Commission but met with a very cold Reception from 'em But however he proceeded in his Design and issu'd out Warrants to seize the suspected Persons Mr  Jones  as ProvostMarshal was oblig'd to execute the Warrants but he met with Resistance every where and was very ill us'd by some of them even to the Hazard of his Life  The Governour whose Name was  Bennet  as he represented the Monarch of  England  should have assisted Mr  Jones  and Mr  Larkins  but whether he was afraid of offending the Inhabitants or not enquiring truly into the Matter Mr  Jones  and Mr  Larkins  were seiz'd and committed to Prison Mr  Jones  first made his Escape and arriv'd safe in  England  where he set forth his Case and had all the Redress he desir'd He was order'd back and reinstated in his former Post  Those that oppos'd him I am inform'd had reprimanding Letters from  England  upon his Account  but when Hate is fix'd in the Minds of some Men 'tis never to be rooted out Their Animosities rose as high as ever and he was once more oblig'd to abandon the Island There is now depending a Suit in Law between the Governour and Mr  Jones  who are both in  England  and there is no doubt but Justice will take Place  Mr  Larkins  was put into the Dungeon of the Prison and it was the common Report he was deny'd even Food to sustain Life and would have certainly expir'd for Want if he had not made his Escape in the Habit of a Woman with the Assistance of a true Friend which is hard to find any where but more especially among the Men of Power in  America  But his Confinement had so worn him and he had contracted so many Distempers by his IllUsage that he expir'd in his Voyage home  As I said before this Island was in former Times the common Receptacle for Pirates and indeed their chiefest Gain proceeded from trading with them Here they came to spend what Money they got and recreate themselves it lying very convenient for 'em between and Degrees of N Latitude and Leagues from the Continent or any other Island  Among their Trees the  Cedar  is the most plentiful which they use even for Firing I have seen Vessels of a hundred Ton built with Cedar and most of the Houses are compos'd of the same  The Laws  should  be the same as those in  England  but Power is generally Chief Judge in  America  Yet if a Person never comes under the Lash of the Superior there is very comfortable Living at  Bermuda  Mr  Jones  Capt  Bayley  and my self had jointly bought a Vessel of about Ton and we had got in all our Freight but Tobacco which we were to take in at  Virginia  and then make up with the Fleet for  England  While we were fitting out our Vessel Mr  Jones  was employ'd in his own Affairs therefore the Care of his Share was committed to me  We set Sail from  Bermuda April  with a fair Gale which continu'd till we lost Sight of the Islands but in the Night a contrary Wind sprang up and blowing very fresh at N N E carry'd us to the Southward of the  Bermudas  and it was the greatest Providence in the World we were not stav'd upon the Rocks but with great Difficulty we got clear of them being oblig'd to ply it to Windward three Days  We had the Misfortune to find our Ship none of the best Sailors yet in four Days we got in our proper Latitude and the Wind continuing pretty fair we made very good Way We had no other Diversion than taking Dolphins with our Fizgig but in my Opinion it is but indifferent Food  We were forty one including Passengers and many of those being sick with the Rocking of the Ship made it uncomfortable living among them and I wish'd my self once more on Shore  April  we were alarm'd at Sight of a Vessel we discover'd which we imagin'd to be a  Spanish  Privateer We crouded all the Sail we could to avoid her which would have been very hard to do if immediately after the Wind had not chang'd to S S E a very strong Gale We bore away before it and ere Night lost Sight of her  As we were at Supper in the Cabin a Son of Capt  Bayley  's came and told his Father that the Colour of the Water was chang'd but his Father reprimanded him and told him he had lost his Senses for it was impossible to be near any Shore When the Sea changes its Colour 'tis an evident Token Land is not far off We continu'd the same Course under a Foresail but our Terror and Surprize was not to be exprest when in the Morning Watch the Captain who being upon Deck discover'd Land right ahead came down into my Cabin and with Tears in his Eyes desir'd I would rise I knew by his Looks something extraordinary was the Matter and got upon Deck to be resolv'd for Capt  Bayley  had not Power to utter a Word I soon found the Danger for I perceiv'd we were in View of  Virginia  near  Ronoke  SandBanks We did all that was in our Power to weather 'em but our Ship having a round Head she would not obey the Helm therefore we all agreed to make in for the Land hoping as it seem'd a bold Shore it was Tide of Flood and then we might through Providence land safe But it proving Tide of Ebb we bulg'd upon the  Ronoke  SandBanks but by lightning the Ship and cutting our Masts by the Board we got clear of that but keeping still in for the Shore we struck upon the second SandBank but not very violently so we threw out our Anchors in hopes we might ride out the Tide but the Wind increasing we dragg'd 'em and were violently thrown upon another SandBank where our Ship stuck and the Waves dash'd over us We had several Women with Children on Board and their dismal Cries pierc'd my very Heart We order'd the Boat out to see if we could gain the Shore that way I jump'd into her one of  the first but ere we could leave the Side of the Ship she was stav'd in Pieces All we could do in this Exigence was get into the Ship again and with much difficulty we compass'd it being dragg'd in by main Force yet if I had not held fast hold by the Coat of one that was in the Water with me and the Foot of another I must have inevitably perish'd for I was under the Keel When I had got Footing upon Deck I fetch'd my Box out of my Cabin and was for securing my Money which amounted to Fifty Pound While I was busying my self with uncording my Box the Captain's Sister reprimanded me for thinking on my Money when all their Lives were in Danger I must own other Thoughts had been more suitable to my Condition therefore I was asham'd of what I was about and had no other Regard than to assist in saving our selves It prov'd a fruitless Labour in endeavouring to get off the Vessel therefore we laid aside all Hopes of saving the Cargo  We had two Blacks on Board that belong'd to Capt  Bayley  that were excellent Divers for the Surge was so violent no one could stem the Billows but by diving who offer'd to get with a Rope on Shore and fasten it from the Ship to a Stump of a Tree and divine Providence had so order'd it there was not any Thing like a Tree for half a Mile on each Side of us I told the Captain it look'd like a good Omen and by the Help of God I did not doubt but we should get safe on Shore  The  Negroes  with much Difficulty did as they had intended and by the Help of the Rope came back to the Ship Capt  Bayley  his Wife and Mate ventur'd into the Water first upon the Awning of the Ship and got safe on Shore tho' it broke assoon as they were landed But  my Ears are even pierc'd this Moment with the Cries of his poor Children that were in the Ship which was more terrible to me than the Storm I offer'd to help 'em upon the Rope but they were in such Frights and Terrors that I could not prevail upon 'em to venture  Two of the Sailors got upon the Rope just as I was going to venture and with their Bustling had very near thrown me once more into the Sea I offer'd my Assistance to the Capain's Sister but she was as timorous as the Children and fed her self with vain Hopes that the Waves would leave 'em by degrees and they might with less Danger get on Shore I took my Leave of all that were on Board and recommending them and my self to the Care of Heaven I got into the Water and laid fast hold on the Rope and with the Assistance of one of the  Negroes  got some Distance from the Ship but the Waves drove back with such an Impetuosity that I was many times in Danger of losing my Hold and so be carried into the main Sea which had certainly came to pass if I had not been assisted by the Black for every time a great Sea was coming to break over us he would cry out  For the Lord's Sake Master hold fast  And whenever he call'd to me I settled my self to receive the Force of the Waves which would as oft overwhelm me and I poured out my Prayers to God for his Assistance At last with much Struggling I could feel my Feet touch the Ground sometimes and by degrees with the utmost Difficulty got Footing and at every Retire of the Waves set my self to running When they drove back upon the Shore I seiz'd upon the Rope or otherwise I had been dash'd to pieces on the Sand But at last my Strength began to fail me with the violent Fatigue I had undergone  and if the  Negro  had not dragg'd me on the Sands whose Strength also was almost gone I must after all my Strugglings for Life have resign'd my self to the Waves  Assoon as I could recover my Spirits I gave the divine Creator of all things Thanks for my wonderful Delivery from the Jaws of Death which was still more wonderful for assoon as I had let go the Rope some other Persons venturing the same way it broke so that not one of the unfortunate Wretches came on Shore but were swallow'd up by the Waves  Awhile after I had got on Shore Captain  Bayley  his Wife and the Mate came down to me and inform'd me that they could find no Road nor any Inhabitants This News renew'd our Griefs for we seem'd to be in as much Danger of Starving now as of Drowning before And to increase our Dread it was not above three Hours to Night and then we had the wild Bears to fear  While we were lamenting our Condition we heard somebody hollow up in the Woods which reviv'd our drooping Senses But running to see who it was we much to our Grief found it to be one of the Sailors that escap'd who was hollowing to his Companion and they were both as drunk as 'twas possible for them to be with Rum before they left the Ship Such Beasts are some Sailors that even the greatest Dangers will not deter them from Drinking if they have an Opportunity  When we were all together that is the Captain his Wife and Mate two white Sailors two  Negroes  and my self we resolv'd to walk to the Southward to see if it were possible to find any Habitations but in less than an Hour our  Journey was stopp'd by an impenetrable Wood and we were obliged to return  We then went Northward but were interrupted by large Swamps and not the least Mark of any Plantation Thus maroon'd as we were we went back again and could perceive the poor Wretches in the Vessel lifting up their Hands to us for Succour but we could neither give 'em Assistance or Comfort I made 'em Signs to let 'em know our Condition was as bad as theirs and that they had nothing to think on but Heaven  It growing near Night some of the poor Creatures ventur'd into the Water but were soon drown'd In short every Object we beheld increas'd our Horror None of us had eat or drank for two Days besides our Fatigue Tho' quite cast down my self I endeavour'd to chear my FellowSufferers and that we might be shelter'd from the Inclemency of the Night which to add to our wretched Condition prov'd a rainy one we by joint Consent and Labour while the Day lasted pluck'd down a good Number of  Palmetoe  Leaves and with Pieces of Trees which we tore for we had never a Knife among us built us up a Hut and shelter'd it from the Weather as well as we could  The  Palmetoe  Leaf is very large and the same that they make the plaited Straw of which forms the finest Hats that come from  Bermuda  and  Carolina  It was a very melancholy Reflection to think of our Condition Nothing to lie upon but the bare wet Ground and our Cloaths that cover'd us were those upon our Backs dropping with Rain and SaltWater no Food nor Hopes of getting any and I was even ready to expire with Thirst While the Hut was preparing  to allay my Drouth I stole by my self urin'd in my TobaccoBox and drank it with as great a Gusto as ever I have done  French  Claret before or since  When I came to lie down in our wretched Tenement the Place was full but I e'en laid my self down upon 'em and tho' a Woman was among us had no Thoughts of different Sexes and by degrees made Room for my self Notwithstanding their complaining of Legs and Arms I held my Tongue and maugre all my Wants and Misfortunes slept soundly till Morning But with the Day Reflection return'd sharpen'd with the extreamest Hunger  When we had got all together again that is seven of us for one of the drunken Sailors was found dead some Distance from our Cabin as we might well imagine with Cold and Want and spoil'd an excellent Proverb  That drunken Men never get any Harm  by my Advice we address'd our selves to the Allseeing Power for Succour all but the Mate who told us that Praying alone would not do therefore while we  pray'd  he would go  seek  After our extempore Orisons were over we rose up and resolv'd to go into the Woods to gather if it was possible something to kill our Hunger But as we turn'd toward the Beach we saw the Mate with another Man a Stranger to us coming towards us The Dove could not be a more pleasing Sight to the Patriarch  Noah  when he return'd with the OliveBranch in his Mouth than that Stranger was to us We ran with all the Speed which our weak Condition would admit of to meet him Under his Arm he had got a little Tub of Butter that the Sea had thrown up and though mixt  with Sand and Gravel we as greedily devour'd it as if it had been Partridge or Pheasant but our Misfortune was when we had tir'd our selves with Eating for I can't say we were satisfy'd we all of us grew Sick and cast it up again  The Stranger to relieve us gave us a Couple of Limes among us which we greedily devour'd and to the Butter again But what was a pleasing Surprize to us our Mate inform'd us a Puncheon of fresh Water was thrown on Shore We eagerly ran and my TobaccoBox serv'd us instead of a Cup The Mate who had slak'd his Thirst before would not let us drink too much for fear of endangering our Lives but with this indifferent Repast we recover'd our fainting Spirits and were more able to bear the Fatigue of the Day  Our Vessel was drove close on Shore but broke in many Pieces and it was a melancholy Sight to behold the dead Bodies covering the Sand But what had almost kill'd Capt  Bayley  and his Wife with Sorrow were the Bodies of his Sister and one of his Children half buried in the Sands For my own part I had no other thing to grieve for but the Loss of my Cargo which consisted of  Cotton Indigo  and Straw Ware which if it had arriv'd safe to  England  would have yielded to my own Share fifteen hundred Pound Tho' the Loss of my  Harpsichord  and  Italian Timbrel  I most regretted whose Remains I discover'd upon the Shore and the whole Strand was cover'd with  Bermuda  Hats Some we pick'd up and among other pieces of the Wreck the Mate discover'd my Box floating on the Surface which by good Fortune he dragg'd on Shore In it was my Money Linnen and Books of Accounts We kept this private from the  Stranger and bury'd it in a Place I had mark'd by several Observations For he had given us to understand it was his usual Custom after a violent Storm to come to the SandBanks in Expectation of Shipwrecks therefore we were not assur'd he might not find Means to destroy us in Hopes of what we had on Shore or leave us without assisting us to some Plantation  When we had done all we could about our Wreck we took leave of the miserable Sight and set forward to the Stranger's Plantation which was about ten Miles off He led us along the Woods by certain Marks on Trees which we were ignorant of but the Inhabitants know how to find one another's Plantations by those Marks and in four Hours for I had my Watch in my Pocket when I was shipwreck'd we once more beheld the pleasing Sight of a Chimney smoaking which was the Habitation of our Guide You may imagine the Joy we had to enter once more into a House after our miserable Hardships But when we came there we found but indifferent Accommodation There were no other Eatables to be got but a little hung Beef and  Humminy  that is  Indian  Corn ground mix'd with Milk and dry'd before the Fire but this was Feasting to us for Hunger is the best Sauce  There were but two Beds in the House which the Family complimented us with The Captain and his Wife had one and Mr  Burnam  and I had the other  I deferr'd going for my Box till the second Day after our Arrival for I was very much out of Order with the Fatigue I had underwent and by lying on the wet Ground I had lost my Hearing which I did not recover throughly till my Arrival in  England  The Mate 'two  Negroes  and my self set out with one to guide us to the Place of our Shipwreck but we were so long in looking for my Box that we were ready to give over all Search But just as we were thinking of returning the Mate happily found it out  The  Negroes  took it by Turns and we brought it safe to the Plantation  I had a good Parcel of Linnen in it which I lent to my FellowSufferers But it was an odd Sight to discover so many Scarecrows with tatter'd Coats and fine ruffled Shirts on  Our Host was very well satisfy'd for our Entertainment with what he found of the Wreck  We staid here five Days to refresh our selves and then resolv'd to go up the River to wait on Colonel  Carew  DeputyGovernor of  NorthCarolina  a Gentleman I had the Honour of being acquainted with We hir'd a Canoo with two Sails and embark'd Capt  Baily  his Wife the Mate two Blacks and the Sailor with another from the Plantation to assist us We sail'd up  Ronoke  Sound with a fresh Gale and at seven aclock the next Morning stopp'd at Colonel  Carew  's Plantation who out of his known Courtesy entertained us very handsomely We took our leaves and at eight aclock the same Evening came before the Governour's House situate on the River  Notaway  which runs into the  Ronoke  about fifty Leagues from the Sea  I sent up one of the Men to acquaint the Governour I was come to wait on him and upon the Instant he came down to the Shore accompany'd by Capt  Cratbach  a Native of  Bermuda  Island and one I had long been acquainted with He had left  Bermuda  since we came away and the Governour and he had just been wishing I had escap'd the Storm as the Messenger came to him  Assoon as ever he saw me he cry'd out I am sorry for your Misfortune I can easily perceive an ill Wind drove you hither He would not suffer us to talk much but hurry'd the whole Company into his DiningRoom where stood a Supper and a Bowl of Punch with several Genlemen his Guests He begg'd their Pardon but told 'em they should neither eat nor drink before we had satisfy'd our selves and we soon clear'd what was put before us and then another Supper was provided for the whole Company which we had our Shares of notwithstanding what we had eaten before  The Governour was but ill provided with Beds therefore Capt  Bayley  and his Wife went to Mr  Glover  's a neighbouring Gentleman and the Secretary would have me home with him about a Mile from the Governour's When we came to his House we found a Quarter of a  Shote  a young Hog and a Turkey on the Table I sat down once more and made a hearty Supper and I must own I never thought I should bring my Stomach to its proper Tone again After we had drank very heartily we went to Bed The next Morning we breakfasted upon broil'd Fowls and Chocolate  My Readers if any I hope will not ridicule my taking Notice so often of Eating till▪ they put themselves in my starv'd Condition  The next Day we went to dine with a Friend of the Secretary's and as we were at Dinner a Messenger came from the Governour and Capt  Bayley  to inform me a Vessel was going that Instant for  Kakatan  a Harbour where the  Virginia  Fleet make up and with the Convoy set sail all together for  England  and that Capt  Bayley  and the rest of my unfortunate Company waited on Board for me Notwithstanding my Stomach  I was oblig'd to make all the Dispatch I could to the Place where the Vessel lay but to my great Misfortune the Wind proving fair for them they were oblig'd to take the Advantage and when I arriv'd at the Port they were almost out of Sight I was very much concern'd at this Loss of my Passage for it was very probable I might not get such another Opportunity till the Fleet was gone and then I should be oblig'd to stay till next Year  The Governour seeing me so much concern'd offer'd me his Horse to go to  Kakatan  by Land about Leagues from the Place where we were and he procured me a Guide an honest  Quaker  who for ten Pieces of Eight agreed to accompany me and bring the Governour's Horse back again  We set out immediately for I had no Luggage to carry because Capt  Bayley  as imagining I would come time enough had got all my Things on Board  We rode that Day about twenty Mile thro' unfrequented Woods but my Guide knew the Way by the abovemention'd Marks upon Trees We came to a Quaker's Plantation and all the Compliments my Guide us'd to him was only this  Friend I have brought along with me a shipwreck'd Gentleman who is going to  Kakatan  and desires a Lodging tonight  who was answer'd by our new Host  Friend come in thou art welcome  And indeed he made his Words good for we had plenty of every thing and a handsome Apartment to lie in the best in the House I was very much pleas'd with his Conversation for I found him a Man of a sound Understanding  In the Morning when I was going I offer'd to pay him for what I had but he seem'd much offended at my Proposition Said he  My House  is no Inn and we see Strangers so very seldom that they are always welcome when they come and God forbid that I should lessen the Store of an unfortunate Man like thy self  In short this is the Treatment I met with in my six Days Travel Hospitality is commendable in all Countries and  England  was once famous for it but it seems at present banish'd to  America  The third Day my Horse tumbled with me into a deep Swamp and I was not only in danger of drowning but of having my Brains dash'd out with his Hoofs in his Floundering I continu'd so long in this Condition that I gave my self up for lost for my Guide could not come to assist me without being in the same Danger At last my Horse with much struggling got Foot on firm Ground by good Fortune I had got hold of the Stirrup and he drew me up with him to the great Joy of my Guide who gave me for gone  You must imagine I was not very easy in the rest of my Day's Journey which I was oblig'd to ride all cover'd with Water and Mud But our Host where we lay at Night got all my Things clean and dry by the time I rose in the Morning  Our first four Days we travell'd through vast Woods without seeing any humane Creature but at the Plantations where we din'd and supp'd and our Stages were very different sometimes more than twenty Mile asunder and at other times not above seven Monstrous Snakes I saw of different Kinds but none attempted to come near us till the fifth Day when as we were riding along my Horse gave a Start and ran on with me five hundred Yards before I could stop him I turn'd about and saw a  RattleSnake  of a monstrous Bulk spring at my Guide who happen'd at that time to be behind me  and it was very well he was for if I had been in his Place I should certainly have met with Death in not knowing how to avoid it  Their manner of springing upon any thing is this they fold themselves up in Rings then clap their Tail to the Ground and dart upon their Prey But as they are some time in doing it a Person may avoid 'em who knows their Manner  There is but one Way to cure the Bite of these venomous Creatures and that is to apply immediately the Fundament of a Fowl to the Wound and keep it there till it be dead which does not always happen If the Fowl dies there is Hope of a Cure but if it does not all the Physicians in the World can't help you My Guide told me this was one of the largest he had ever seen I believe it was near six Yards in Length and as thick as a lusty Man's Thigh It is very rare for 'em to come so near the Roads but this being little frequented perhaps was the Reason of it The Rattle which is in their Tail makes an odd Sort of a Noise When I was at  Philadelphia  a Gentleman show'd me the Rattle It was about a Yard and a half long in small Joints cover'd with a thin transparent Skin like your white Goldbeater's Skin They say they have a Joint grows every Year but I can't tell who can prove it The Rattle as it lay folded in my Hand seem'd so light that if I had not seen it there I could not have perceiv'd it by the Weight  The last Day's Journey was one of the pleasantest I had ever travell'd in my Life in a fine sweet Road shaded by Trees for many Miles together and through 'em on each side numerous Plantations with a well cultivated Glebe  The whole Prospect put me in Mind of the Vale of  Evesham  in  England  The sixth Night I lay at the Father's of my Guide having one Day's Journey more to reach  Kakatan  Mr  Ratcliff  the Name of my Guide's Father was Owner of a handsome Plantation upon  James  River and there were so many about it that it look'd like a little Town  The next Day after my Arrival being  Sunday  there was a general Assembly of the Brethren and most of the Elders din'd with Mr  Ratcliff  When Dinner was serv'd they began in their usual manner with their long Graces and when one had made an end another rose up to begin but Mr  Ratcliff  begg'd upon my Account that they would for once abridge the Motion of the Spirit and let it take its full Scope for an AfterGrace  We had Notice from  Kakatan  that the Fleet would not sail for some time so I staid with my friendly Quaker four Days who treated me very generously I call'd for his Son to dismiss him back to the Governor with the Horses As I was paying him the Money I agreed for his Father coming in by Accident was very angry with him and declared he would disown him for his Child if he took a Penny I was not at all pleas'd with the Refusal for the poor Man had taken a great deal of Pains with me wherefore meeting by Chance with four Yards of Muslin to be sold I bought it and made him a Present of it unknown to his Father tho' I had some Difficulty to make him accept of it after what his Father had said to him  The fourth Day after my Arrival we had Notice the Fleet would sail in a few Days This gave me a great deal of Uneasiness for I could not get to  Kakatan  without a Boat and Mr  Ratcliff  's was broke to Pieces some time before I came there But he seeing the Uneasiness I labour'd under procur'd one Yet another Difficulty arose we could not gain even for Money any Body to row us Well said Mr  Ratcliff  since we have got a Boat thou shalt not be made uneasie for want of People to work it I and my Children will go along with thee Accordingly we set out and arrived at  Kakatan  But we were surpriz'd not to find above five Sail there and one of 'em that Vessel that Capt  Bayley  went in so I had the Satisfaction of getting my Things again  Notwithstanding the Fleet's not being there the Place was so full of People in Expectation of it that there was no Lodging to be had I was not so much concern'd for my self as for my generous Quaker who was to meet with such bad Accommodation for his good Nature in accompanying me  I met with a Gentleman bound for  England  one Mr  Le Cruce  at present a WineMerchant in St  Martin  's Lane who seeing the Shifts we were put to offer'd me half his Bed which I accepted of for my Friendly Quaker but I could not prevail upon him to take it therefore I lay with Mr  Le Cruce  my self and Mr  Ratcliff  with his Sons made what Shift they could upon the Ground  It was the Report of every one that the Fleet would not get together in four Months so I resolved to take a Trip to  Philadelphia  in the mean time  I did not know how to fasten a Present upon Mr  Ratcliff  for his Civility for he would not hear of any thing like it but at last I found out this Method I bought a Runlet of Rum a Thing very much in Esteem among the Planters  and I begg'd Mr  Ratcliff  to add to the Obligations I had already received from him by taking Charge of it and a Letter to one Mr  Randal  a Planter in his Neighbourhood In the Letter I sent to Mr  Randal  was one inclos'd for Mr  Ratcliff  where I inform'd him the Rum was to him only as a small Acknowledgment for the many Obligations he had laid me under  The next Day he and his Sons took their leave of me even without taking any thing for the Hire of the Boat tho' I had bargain'd for it before I left the Place  The Vessel that was to carry me to  Philadelphia  was not clear'd of her Lading therefore I was oblig'd to stay seven Days at  Kakatan  which is no Place of Resort but only once a Year at the Time the Fleet makes up for  England  so there are not many Conveniences expected there  The Day before I fail'd for  Philadelphia  I receiv'd a Letter from my Friendly Quaker with a Present of a powder'd  Shote  and several Turkies which he sent me by Water  The Letter was as follows  Friend  Castelman  I  Receiv'd thy Present in a very particular manner and tho' I am not very easy about it yet I give thee my Thanks with a Promise of a grateful Remembrance from me and mine I pray thee to accept what I send thee as from a real Friend and I commit thee to God  J Ratcliff  The Vessel had but one Cabin in it which was taken up by a WomanPassenger so that I was oblig'd to make shift to warp my self up in the Sail and the Spray of the Waves beating  over us now and then I had but a wet Lodging and tho' it was nothing to what I underwent before yet I got more Cold by it We made so good Way that we got up to  NewCastle  in  Delaware  River the second Evening and we prevail'd upon the Master to stay there all Night where I got a good Lodging at a publick House being the first time I had paid for any thing since my Shipwreck  NewCastle  the Capital of the County of  NewCastle  is a handsome wellbuilt Town standing upon an Eminence which gives you a pleasant View from the River  Delaware  The  Dutch  were the first Founders but did not possess it long There are now above handsome Houses and Foundations for several more As it is daily increasing in Wealth by Trade we may imagine it will increase in Buildings and Inhabitants I have been inform'd they have discover'd in the Neighbourhood of this Town a fine Iron Mine  The Day following we din'd at  Chester  a little neat Town on the same River consisting of near three hundred Houses We were very handsomely entertain'd there by a Gentleman of the Place who would accompany us to  Philadelphia  We had a pleasant Voyage with many delightful Prospects of Towns Villages and Plantations on both sides of the River and in the Evening we landed at  Philadelphia  the Capital of  Pensylvania  Pensylvania  takes its Name from  William Penn  Esq  Son to Sir  William Penn  Admiral of a Squadron in the  Dutch  War where he behav'd like a Man of Courage and Conduct His Son the present Proprietor met with some Difficulty in obtaining his Patent by reason he  had declar'd himself Head of the People call'd  Quakers  Pensylvania  is compos'd of all that Tract of Land with its Islands Rivers Coasts and Bays which lies from forty to fortyfive Degrees of North Latitude and is one of the richest Countries in his Majesty's foreign Dominions  The Air is pleasant wholesome and unclouded or very rarely overcast Tho' the Winter is something colder and the Summer hotter than in  England  yet the Inhabitants have known several Winters together without Frosts The Day in the Summer is two Hours shorter than ours and in Winter two Hours longer which is really better for Business of all kinds And certainly this is a Tract of Ground as well seated as any in the World for Pleasure and Profit It is bounded on the East by  WestJersey  on the West by  Virginia Canada  on the North and  Maryland  on the South all except  Canada  fine  English  Settlements  The original Inhabitants of all these Places are suppos'd to be the ten Tribes of the  Jews  that were scatter'd but from whence they derive their Authority even for this Supposition I can't imagine 'Tis true some of the ancient  Jewish  Customs are among the  Indians  but as every Nation and People have Customs peculiar to themselves in my Opinion there is nothing to be gather'd from thence 'Tis certain they have something of the Countenance of the  Jews  they observe New Moons and offer their FirstFruits to their Idols They are most of 'em well made and exactly proportion'd in their Features without the thick Lips and flat Noses of the  Negroes  They are generally good natur'd and inoffensive slow to Anger but hard to be appeas'd a courteous  and humane Behaviour will gain upon 'em more than Severity It is very seldom they wrong a good Master but I have known 'em frequently venture their Lives for 'em Their Language is very lofty and high sounding but not copious for one Word hath several Meanings I'll give you from my Friend Mr  Thomas  a short Specimen  Hodi hita nee huska apeechi nee machi  Pensylvania  huska dogwachi keshow apeechi nowa huska hayly chetena koon peo  Thus in  English  Farewell my Friend I shall go shortly to  Pensylvania  We shall have a cold Moon presently and hard Frosts will soon follow  They throw their Children into the Water assoon as born to harden their Bodies The Business of the Men is to fish or hunt and the Women to Till their Ground and look after their Children who commonly go alone at nine Months They are most of them knowing in Botany and if at any time visited with Sickness cure themselves by their Knowledge in Herbs and Roots They are exceeding charitable and if any among 'em have the Misfortune to be lame or blind they take care they shall want for nothing The Boys go a hunting or fishing with the Father at six Years old and when they are experienced in both and arrive to their sixteenth Year they may marry The Girls stay at home with their Mother who instructs them in her Business The Women are very modest and chaste and you can't affront them more than by saying any thing to the contrary of either Adultery is punish'd with Death among 'em  Their Habitations are generally mean and small and their Utensils a Pot and two or three Calabashes with a Bowl and when they travel they lie in the Woods about a Fire to keep the wild Beasts from them They are People of a merry Disposition continually laughing and singing even at their Work They have some particular Songs among 'em though but indifferent Tunes and their Instruments of Musick are as poor They are generally given to Sobriety but if they once get Liquor of the  Europeans  they never give over till dead drunk and I have seen 'em lye in the middle of the Roads and Streets like so many Dogs Assoon as ever they come to themselves they plunge into the Water and gather some Herbs squeeze 'em into a Calabash which they drink by which Means they are recover'd and are never sick after their Debauches Their Age generally comes up to seventy and very few to eighty I have heard one  Indian  speaking to another when on his DeathBed of the Uncertainty of this Life and how happy he should be in the Company of their God where would be no want of Corn or Wood or any Thing that was needful for him But there is a great Number instructed in the Christian Faith There are  Indian  Schools to teach 'em Writing as well as Reading and most of 'em are very docile  The Country of  Pensylvania  abounds with every thing necessary for the Life of Man even for the most luxurious  The Woods afford fine Pidgeons Pheasants Quails Partridges Woodcocks Snipes wild Turkies and various other Birds About the Rivers Geese Ducks Swans Teal Divers Brands c In the Rivers generally a gravelly Bottom are to be found Herrings Smelts  Roach Dace Eels Perch Salmon Trout Gurnets Shadds Catsheads Sheepsheads and many more with fine large Oysters preferable to any I ever tasted in  England  and when any of these are brought to Market you may buy 'em very reasonably  The Wood produce Cedar Mulberry Vines  Ash Chesnut and the finest  Ships I am inform'd some of  have made Wine with Grapes  Growth but I have heard nothing in Commendation of it  The  Dutch  were the first Foreigners that came to these Parts but they made but few Settlements their chief Business was to trade with the  Indians  for Skins Furrs c and give them in Exchange Rum Beer and Sugar The next that appear'd was a Colony from  Sweden  who began to plant and manure the Ground The  Dutch  were offended at these Interlopers as they call'd 'em and threaten'd to make War upon 'em which was prevented by the  Swedes  surrendring the Plantations to 'em who return'd home  In the  Dutch  War Sir  Robert Carr  made a Descent upon 'em outed 'em quite and took Possession of it for the Crown of  England  in the Year and left a Relation of his of the same Name as Governour but the next Year the  Dutch  got the Mastery again and the few  English  that were there settled themselves in the other  English  Colonies better provided with Defence against an Invader  The  Dutch  remain'd Possessors of this pleasant Country till the Peace was concluded between  England  and  Holland  and then it was deliver'd once again to the  English  but no great Progress was made there till the Year after  Mr  Penn  had gain'd the Patent for it In less than a Year there were a hundred Houses built and form'd into a Town to which Mr  Penn  gave the Name of  Philadelphia  or Brotherly Love A Place for its Situation very agreeable seated high upon a Neck of Land form'd by two fine navigable Rivers two hundred Miles from the Sea yet Ships of five hundred Ton can unlade on the Key  The Country about it is rich well water'd and wooded the Earth producing a vast Increase They reap their Corn about the Beginning of  July  The Gardens and Orchards yield all Roots Fruits and Flowers we have in  England  and several peculiar only to the Country The Air is so healthy that there is no Occasion for Physicians being they find Cures for their accidental Diseases by Simples and the People so peaceful there's no want of a Lawyer among them and if any Difference happens a third Person makes up the Matter without the Charge of a LawSuit This Country is divided into six Counties or Divisions and each County sends six Members to the Assembly at  Philadelphia Chester    NewCastle    Kent    Bucks    Sussex  and  Philadelphia  All these mention'd Places have Yearly Fairs and Weekly Markets being very conveniently situated for Commerce with the Country about 'em  They have excellent Copper Mines which produce better Copper than any in  England  both for Colour and Finess Coal Mines have been lately found and several mineral Waters that perform the same Office as  Bath Tunbridge  or  Epsom  There is also found good Stone for Building that proves handsome and lasting and another thin Stone which they Tile their Houses with being much neater than our  English  Tile Also Loadstones and the  Salamander  Stone having a Substance like Cotton in the Veins which will not consume in the Fire  The Woods produce Wolves Panthers Bears Deer Hares Antelopes Foxes Rackoons Rabbets Squirrels Bevers c whose Skins yield great Profit to the Taker and a Creature call'd a  Possum  that has a false Belly into which the young ones retire in time of Danger Also the FlyingSquirrel with Wings like those of a Bat and I have often seen it fly from Tree to Tree  Red Deer Buffalos and  Elks  are common in the Woods and delicious Food but they are generally purchas'd from the  Indians  tho' at a very reasonable Rate they being the People that best know how to hunt them There is a Reward given 'em for killing a Bear or Wolf which has very much lessen'd the Number of both though any Person has the Liberty to hunt fish or fowl without being molested There's also Plenty of Otters about the Rivers and such a multitude of Frogs in the  Swamps  A  Swamp  is much of the same kind as the  Boggs  in  Ireland  that they disturb you with their Croaking especially the  BullFrog  that makes a Noise something like that Beast and is the Base to all the others  If the distress'd People of  England  knew the Comforts of  Pensylvania  and the casy Means there is of a Livelihood they would never stay where they are in a continual Scene of Want and Misery Even the meanest Servant has better Wages than those in  England  If criminal Persons were sent over there they would find Employment and yet be restrain'd in the Vices for which they were punish'd For a Thief there is to return Fourfold what he has stole and if he has not wherewithal to do that he's compell'd to work it out But every thing is in  such Plenty there they would have no Occasion to exercise their Talents that Way  Their Beef Mutton Pork Lamb Veal c is equal to our Meat in  England  with which they trade to the  LeewardIslands  and bring in Return Rum Sugar Molossos and Pieces of Eight Their Horses are strong handsome and hardy and seldom feed on any thing but Grass and after the hardest Day's Work are turn'd out hot into the Fields yet get no Harm  The Country produces great Numbers of Apple and Pear Trees with which they make great Quantities of Cyder and Perry that is very wholesome and well tasted  There are many large beautiful wellbuilt Towns in the Province of  Pensylvania  of which as I said before  Philadelphia  is the chief It is a noble large and populous City standing on as much Ground as our  English  City of  Bristol  seated upon a Neck of Land form'd by the Rivers  Delaware  and the  Schuylkill  both navigable many Leagues above the City It is built square in Form of a ChessBoard with each Front facing one of the Rivers  There are several Streets near two Mile long as wide as  Holborn  and better built after the  English  Manner The chief are  Broadstreet Kingstreet  and  Highstreet  tho' there are several other handsome Streets that take their Names from the Productions of the Country as  Mulberry Walnut Beech Sassafras Cedar Vine Ash  and  Chesnut Streets  From these Streets run great Numbers of Courts Yards and Allies with wellbuilt Houses in 'em There are several Coves and Docks where large Ships are built and by a moderate Computation there has been launch'd from the Stocks of this City in forty Year near Sail of Ships besides SmallCraft which may in some sort  give us an Idea of the Opulency of the Place Many of their Merchants keep their Coaches and the Tradesmens Shops and Streets are well frequented All Religions are tolerated here which is one Means to increase the Riches of the Place The People of the Church of  England  as by Law establish'd have a neat wellbuilt Church founded in the Year and I am inform'd the Foundation is laid for another The  Quakers  who are the major Part of the Inhabitants have several Meetings There is a  Swedish  reform'd Church Mr  Rudman  the Incumbent a Man of singular Learning and Piety who is as much follow'd by the  Quakers  when he preaches as the  Protestants  I shall beg leave to give one Instance of his Humility and Piety When Subscriptions were taking in to build the Church he subscrib'd a considerable Sum but when call'd upon for the Money he had it not in his Power to pay it yet to keep his Word he contracted with the MasterBuilder for so much aday to carry the Hod till he had work'd his SubscriptionMoney out This was an Instance of his Piety and Zeal for Religion and I fancy if Churches were to be built after the same Manner in a certain Island the Work would go but slowly on There are single Houses upon the Key that have cost  l  the Building Mr  Badcock  's Brewhouse is a noble large Building and has in it one single Vessel that will hold eight Ton of Liquor  In this City is held the Courts of the Province and the Assembly meet here which is in the nature of a dependant Parliament as in those Cities of  France  that are distant from the Capital There are three Fairs in the Year and every Week two Markets In time of the Fairs the City is so throng'd as well as the adjacent Plantations that it is hard to find a Lodging  The Government and Constitutions are the same as in  England  Their Council is compos'd of the Protestants and Quakers but the Publick Officers are taken out of the former The Governour is nominated by the King of  England  and the rest of the civil Officers are Master of the Rolls four Judges a Judge of the Admiralty Secretary AttorneyGeneral Treasurer Publick Register Clerk of the Peace as also a Commissary and a SurveyorGeneral These with eight Members of the Council form the Government of the City The Number of the Inhabitants is generally suppos'd to be upwards of besides Slaves There is hardly any Trade in  England  but the same may be met with in  Philadelphia  and every Mechanick has better Wages a Journeyman Taylor has twelve Shillings a Week besides his Board and every other Trade in Proportion has the same Advantage  There is a PostOffice lately erected which goes to  Boston  in  NewEngland Charlestown  in  Carolina  and the other neighbouring Places The uncultivated Ground which is not grubb'd sells for ten times the Value it did at first though there is none of that sort within ten Miles round the City And that within the Neighbourhood that was sold for ten Pound at first will fetch above three hundred now All Women's Work is very dear there and that proceeds from the smallness of the Number and the Scarcity of Workers for even the meanest single Women marry well there and being above Want are above Work The Proprietor of this fine Country as I said before is  William Pen  Esq  who has a sine Seat call'd  Pensbury  built on three Islets if I may so call 'em for a Branch of the River  Delaware  runs thrice round it In his Orchards and Gardens may be found all the  Fruits Roots and Herbs that are in  England  and many more peculiar to the Country There is very good Paper made in  Pensylvania  Linen Druggets Crapes Camblets and Serges with which they trade Most of the Merchants and some Tradesmen have handsome Country Houses well and conveniently furnish'd No Insults from the  Indians  were ever heard of here which is more than any of our other Plantations upon the Continent can say neither are there any of them us'd as Slaves but they are paid as well as the  Europeans  for their Commodities or Labour and there are more Christians among 'em than in any other Nation in  America  for their Number Most of them bring up their Children to read and write and some of them are bound Apprentice to the  Europeans  who prove as good Workmen at the Business they follow as their Masters In short in the midst of War they enjoy the Tranquility of Peace They are too far distant from the Sea to fear the Invasion of a foreign Enemy and there are several Places of Strength upon the River of  Delaware  before they can arrive at  Philadelphia  Yet when I was there the Town was alarm'd with a false Report that the  French  had landed within the Bay and committed several Acts of Hostility It was judg'd by some that this Report was spread abroad on purpose to see how active the People would be to defend themselves and whether the  Quakers  were to be depended upon in case of an Invasion The Governor got at the Head of about Men and exhorted the  Brethren  to stand up for the Defence of their Lives and Estates but they declar'd the carnal Weapon did not belong to them yet they would retire and pray for us The People of the Town brought out their Provision and Liquor and  freely gave it among the Soldiers who made as free with it Before Night News came that it was a false Alarm which I believe did not displease any of us  In the Heat of the Day I sometimes took a Walk with some of the Town to  Fair Mount  a pleasant Place shaded with Trees on the River  Schuylkill  As we were coming home one Day deep in Discourse with one another as I was stepping over a Stile I saw stretch'd on the Ground before me a Snake as I suppose asleep I had not Power to draw my Leg back again but my Foot fell just upon the Head and part of the Neck of the Reptile more by the particular Direction of Providence than my Design It sprung up so quick and twisted round my Right Leg and Body with such Force that I was in Fear of being strangled however I kept my Foot fix'd fast upon its Head and in a little time it fell down dead It is almost impossible for Words to describe what I felt at this Accident the very Touch of it about my Leg and Body had very near taken away my Breath and it was the greatest Providence in the World I did not take my Foot from the Head of the Snake for if I had it would certainly have bit me It was a considerable time before I could shake off my Apprehension and I was downright sick with the Fright the whole Day after Some of my Companions had the Curiosity to measure it It was in Length two Yards nine Inches and ten Inches about from the Neck to within a Yard of the Tail I remember very well after this Accident whenever I had Occasion to cross a Stile in  Pensylvania  or  Old England  I ever took Care to look before me so lasting is the Impression of Fear and Danger upon the Minds of Men  I continu'd at  Philadelphia  near four Months and was very well entertain'd by the Gentlemen of the Place I am pleas'd I have it in my Power to pay 'em my publick Acknowledgment of Thanks for all their Favours particularly the Reverend Mr  Brooks  whom I met with by Chance at  Philadelphia  His Business there was to raise Subscriptions for a new Church near  NewYork  When he heard of my Misfortunes he was so generous and charitable as to offer to lend me a Sum of Money he had in his Hands upon my bare Word only which I was to return to him from  England  by the Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts As I was not in want of it I did not accept his intended Favour but I shall ever gratefully remember his kind Intentions  I must not forget the many Obligations I had the Honour to receive from his Excellency Governor  Evans  nor Mr  Evans  the Commissary who was particularly civil to me These Gentlemen tho' of the same Name are no otherwise related than by marrying the Daughters of Mr  Moor  the Collector of the King's Customs The Commissary is just gone for  Philadelphia  again having been in  England  near a Twelvemonth about an Affair between the present Governor Sir  William Keith  and him relating to the King's Customs Among the rest of my Friends I must not forget the facetious Mr  Staples  DancingMaster who was the first Stranger of  Philadelphia  that did me the Honour of a Visit and to his merry Company I owe the passing of many a dull Hour that probably might have lain heavy upon the Hands of a Man under my Circumstances depriv'd of Fortune in a strange Country having no Friends in whose Power it was to assist me nearer than  England  for Mr  Jones  was too much involv'd in his own troublesome Affairs at  Bermuda  to expect any thing from him But the Generosity of the  Philadelphians  is rooted in their Natures for it is the greatest Crime among them not to show the utmost Civility to Strangers And if I were oblig'd to live out of my native Country I should not be long puzzled in finding a Place of Retirement which should be  Philadelphia  There the oppress'd in Fortune or Principles may find a happy  Asylum  and drop quietly to their Graves without Fear or Want  In the Beginning of  August  News arriv'd that the Fleet would be ready to sail from  Kakatan  the latter End of the Month so that I now began to bend my Thoughts towards my native Country I pick'd up at  Philadelphia  four more Companions that intended the same Voyage and  August  we took leave of our Friends and the lovely City of  Philadelphia  which I shall always remember with the utmost Satisfaction We hir'd a Boat to carry us down the  Delaware  and lay the first Night at a Planter's an Acquaintance of one of my Companions who treated us with the usual Civilities of the Country The next Day we din'd on Board our Boat and at Night arriv'd at  Lewis  about Leagues from  Philadelphia  and from the Sea We staid here three Days This Town is the Capital of  Sussex  County and is built upon the  Hoorkill  a River that runs into the  Delaware  A little below begins the Bay of  Delaware  which is form'd by Cape  William  and Cape  James  this last is the utmost Bounds of  Pensylvania  While we staid here I had the Curiosity to go into the Woods to see 'em gather Honey it being free for any one which proceeds  from its great Plenty and you may buy the best Beeswax at  Philadelphia  for four Pence a Pound At  Lewis  we had some of the largest Oysters and Cockles I ever saw in my Life some of the former were six Inches Diameter out of the Shell and very well tasted At this Place they make a rich Soup compos'd of these and other Shellfish which is very nourishing and palatable From  Lewis  we were to walk over an Isthmus of eight Mile that parts  Delaware  River and  Chesapeak  Bay which would save us three or four Days Sailing for we had Notice of a Ship call'd the  Globe  a new Vessel of near five hundred Ton and twentyfour Guns that was at  Kakatan  and would be willing to receive Passengers We set out from  Lewis  with Horses to carry what little Baggage we had but we chose to walk it on Foot our selves We din'd at a pleasant Plantation about the midway of our Journey but found it a difficult matter to prevail upon a Couple of young Girls to come near us at first for they took us for Privateers but at last we prevail'd upon 'em and they call'd their Father c who made very much of us One of the Girls perceiving I had a Watch in my Hand to see what time of Day it was begg'd to look upon it but it was very pleasant to see her Fear when she touch'd it and would not be persuaded but it was alive from its going and the Noise it made I ask'd her if she had never seen or heard of a Watch before She told me she had never seen one but her Sister had read of 'em I only mention this to shew the Simplicity and Innocence of those Inhabitants of  America  that live retir'd in the Country for they told me they had neither of 'em been four  Mile from their own House in their Lives  We took Leave of our Planter and his Family and got that Night to a Plantation on  Chesapeak  Bay where we lay all Night and were well entertain'd The next Day we set about getting a Boat to carry us to  Kakatan  but we met with a great deal of Difficulty in procuring one and were three Days before we could succeed but at last we got one by Accident that was coming up the Bay We got on Board and arriv'd at  Kakatan  the same Evening  Kakatan  is no more than a large Cove where all the Fleet rendezvous in order to set Sail for  England  There are some few Houses scatter'd up and down the Bay which go at great Rates upon this Occasion It lies about ten Leagues up the River of  Chesapeak  which River divides  Virginia  and  Maryland  It is the greatest River upon the Continent in the  English  Dominions and the farthest navigable up in the Country and many other Rivers fall into it We enquir'd for the  Globe  and soon agreed with the Captain for his great Cabin at a reasonable Rate and he seem'd pleas'd with his Company We provided what little Necessaries we wanted as some fresh Provisions Liquor c and on  Sept  the Commadore hung out the Signal for Sailing  I thought it was a noble Sight to see so many Ships under Sail all together There were upwards of two hundred Sail of MerchantMen besides four Sail of Men of War for our Convoy  We drove down the River and at Night got overagainst the  Virginia  Capes Cape  Henry  and Cape  Charles  which form the Mouth of  Chesapeak  Bay The next Day we left the  main Land astern and we had Orders from the Commadore to spread our selves for fear we should fall foul of each other in the Night We continu'd sailing several Days together with a prosperous Gale  Sept  the Skies threaten'd us with a Storm we reev'd our Sails in Expectation of it but it blew so violently at last that we were oblig'd to lie under a reeft Foresail and it was well we had a good stout Ship under us or we had perish'd Our Fleet was soon scatter'd and we saw several of them sink in View with their whole Crew and it was not in the Power of the other Ships to succour 'em I now began to think I should be bury'd in the Deep tho' our Captain always gave us great Hopes in the Goodness and Strength of the Ship for she was well rigg'd and fitted it being her first Voyage We were terribly toss'd all Night and when the Morning dawn'd we could not perceive one of the Fleet so we were oblig'd to sail alone which gave me many melancholy Reflections However we had this to comfort us that the Storm was abated and the next Day to my great Joy we discover'd forty of our scatter'd Fleet and one Man of War When we could come within Hailing we receiv'd a dismal Account of the Loss of above thirty of the Fleet that founder'd at Sea Some of the Men were sav'd as also part of the Cargo of seven or eight but the rest went to the Bottom  One Reason of the Weakness of the Ships was their being unsheath'd and staying four Months beyond their usual Time the Worms had got into their Bottoms  We sail'd together with a fair Wind till we came upon the Coast of  France  and then we had  the Misfortune of being dispers'd in the Night and our Danger was the greater in being so near an Enemy's Country The next Day we perceiv'd a Sail making up to us We soon discover'd it was a  French  Privateer There were three Ships of us in Company we got together to consult and at last it was agreed to prepare for the Fight though in a very poor Condition for an Engagement Some of the Sailors advis'd us to meet 'em which Advice was taken We immediately crouded all the Sail we could and got our Hands upon Deck Passengers and all and having the Wind of 'em we bore down upon 'em which had the desired Effect for assoon as they perceiv'd us chasing 'em they made all the Sail they could to get from us and in a little time got out of our Sight We were very well pleas'd with our Stratagem and continu'd our Course  November  we discover'd  England  whose Chalky Cliffs gave us all a vast Delight We coasted along the Channel with the pleasing Hopes of once more fetting our Feet upon our native Country and  Nov  we got safe into  Deal  Harbour We staid there but one Night and hir'd Horses to go to  Canterbury  from whence we took a Coach to  Gravesend  and the next Day went in the PassageBoat to  London  As we were going up the River a Ship outwardbound came so suddenly upon us that we were in the utmost Danger of being run over Most of the Passengers got up ready to lay hold of the Tackling of the Ship to save themselves but by Providence she mist us by about two Inches This put me in Mind of the Uncertainty of Human Life and that a Man may  meet with Death when he imagines himself past all Danger  I landed at  London Nov  I gave God Thanks for his many and signal Mercies where I hope I am settled for the Remnant of my Life without trusting my self any more to the Dangers of the tempestuous Sea  FINIS
