 LOVE in the SUDS A TOWN ECLOGUE BEING THE LAMENTATION of ROSCIUS FOR THE LOSS of his NYKY  Dixin' ego vobis in hôc esse Atticam elegantiam  TER  Oh me infelicem  quae laudârum quantum luctus habuerint  PHAED  With ANNOTATIONS and an APPENDIX  THE FIFTH EDITION  LONDON PRINTED FOR J WHEBLE PATERNOSTERROW  MDCCLXXII  To DAVID GARRICK Esq  SIR  THE author of the following Eclogue having requested my assistance to introduce it to the world it was with more indignation than surprize I was informed of your having used your extensive influence over the press to prevent its being advertised in the Newspapers How are you Sir concerned in the Lamentation of  Roscius  for his  Nyky  Does your modesty think no man entitled to the appellation of Roscius but yourself Does Nyky resemble any nicknamed favourite of yours Or does it follow that if you have cherished an unworthy favourite you must bear too near a resemblance to him  Qui capit ille facit  beware of selfaccusation where others bring no charge Or granting you right in these particulars by what right or privilege do you Sir set up for a licenser of the press That you have long successfully usurped that privilege to swell both your fame and fortune is well known Not the puffs of the quacks of Bayswater and Chelsea are so numerous and notorious but by what authority do you take upon you to shut up the general channel in which writers usher their performances to the public If they attack either your talents or your character  in utrumque paratus  you are armed to defend yourself You have besides your ingenuous countenance and conscious innocence  Nil conscire sibi nulla pallescere culpa  Besides this brazen bulwark I say you have a ready pen and a long purse The press is open to the one and the bar is ever ready to open with the other For a poor author not a printer will publish a paragraph not a pleader will utter a quibble You have then every advantage in the contest It is needless therefore to endeavour to intimidate your antagonists by countenancing your retainers to threaten their lives These intimidations let me tell you Sir have an ugly suspicious look They are besides needless the  genus irritabile vatum  want no such personal provocations Heaven knows the life of a playwright like that of a spider is in a state of the most slender dependency It is well for my rhiming friend that his hangs not on so slight a thread He thinks nevertheless that he has reason to complain as well as the publick of your having long preferred the flimzy translated patch'dup and misaltered pieces of your favourite compilers to the arduous attempts at originality of writers who have no personal interest with the manager In particular he thinks  the two pieces you are projecting to get up next winter for the emolument of your favorite in disgrace or to reimburse yourself the money you may have advanced him might for the present at least be laid aside  But you will ask me perhaps in turn Sir what right I have to interfere with the business of other people or with yours I will answer you It is because I think your business as patentee of a theatreroyal is not so entirely yours but that the publick also have some concern in it You Sir indeed have long behaved as if you thought the town itself a purchased appurtenance to the theatre but tho' the scenes and machines are yours nay tho' you have even found means to make comedians and poets your property it should be with more caution than you practise that you extend your various arts to make so scandalous a property of the publick  Again I answer it is because I have some regard for my friend and as much for myself whom you have treated as ill perhaps as you have done any other writer while under your auspices some of the persons stigmatised by the satirist have frequently combined to do me the most essential injury But  nemo me impurè lacessit  Not that I mean now to enter into particulars which may be thought to relate too much to myself and too little to the publick When I shall have leisure to draw a faithful portraiture of Mr Garrick not only from his behaviour to me in particular but from his conduct towards poets players and the town in general I doubt not to convince the most partial of his admirers that he hath accumulated a fortune as manager by the meanest and most meretricious devices and that the theatrical props which have long supported his exalted reputation as an actor have been raised on the ruins of the English stage  In the mean time I leave you to amuse yourself with the following jeu d'esprit of my friend hoping tho' it be a severe correction for the errours of your past favouritism it may prove a salutary guide to you for the future With regard to the mode of its publication I hope also to stand excused with the reader for thus interposing to defeat the success of those arts which you so unfairly practise to prevent from reaching the public eye whatever is disagreeable to your own  I am Sir Yours c W KENRICK  LOVE in the SUDS A TOWN ECLOGUE  WHITHER away now GEORGE  The brother and constant companion of ROSCIUS the Mercury of our

words no dictionary can explain  Goldsmith goodnatur'd man shall next defend  His fosterbrother  So called from having not long since made one in a poetical triumvirate which gave occasion to the following verses in imitation of Dryden's famous epigram on Milton "Three poets in three distant ages born" c  Poor Dryden what a theme badst thou  Compar'd to that which offers now  What are your Britons Romans Grecians  Compar'd with thoroughbred Milesians  Step into Griffin's shop he'll tell ye  Of Goldsmith Bickerstaff and Kelly  Three poets of one age and nation  Whose more than mortal

into fashion for philosophy to go in masquerade if there be any truth in the subject of the following which lately appeared in the public prints  To Doctor GOLDSMITH on seeing his name in the list of the mummers at the late masquerade  Say should the philosophic mind disdain  That good which makes each humbler bosom vain  Let  taught pride dissemble all it can  Such Rule things are great to little man  GOLDSMITH  How widely different Goldsmith are the ways  Of doctors now and those of ancient days  Theirs taught the truth in academic shades  Ours haunt lewd hops and midnight masquerades  So chang'd the times say philosophic sage  Whose genius suits so will this tasteful age  Is the Pantheon late a sink obscene  Become the fountain of chaste Hippocrene  Or do thy moral numbers quaintly flow  Inspir'd by th' Aganippe of Soho  Do wisdom's sons gorge cates and vermicelli  Like beastly Bickerstaff or bothering Kelly  Or art thou tir'd of th' undeserv'd applause  Bestow'd on bards affecting virtue's cause  Wouldst thou like Sterne resolv'd at length to thrive  Turn pimp and die cockbawd at sixtyfive  Is this the good that makes the humble vain  The good philosophy should not disdain  If so let pride dissemble all it can  A modern sage is still much less than man  MORNING CHRONICLE  Let me no longer then my loss deplore  But to his ROSCIUS Muse my NYK restore  IMITATIONS

reads  Tho' sense and language are expell'd the stage  For nonsense pleases best a senscless age  What tho' the author of the New Bath Guide  Up to the skies my talents late hath cried  The compliments passed between these celebrated geniuses indeed were mutual Mr A commending ROSCIUS for his fine acting and ROSCIUS in return Mr A for his fine writing The panegyric on both sides was equally modest and just and yet some snarling epigrammatist could not forbear throwing out the following illnatured jeu d'esprit on the occasion  On the poetical compliments lately passed between Mess G and A    When mincing masters met with misses  Pay mutual compliments for kisses  Miss Polly sings no doubt divinely  And master Jacky spouts as finely  But how I hate such odious greeting  When two

compared by the poet to a landtorroise buried in the earth on account of the slowness of its motion and the clouds of dirt and dullness with which it is surrounded the former hath been long known by the above appellation from the following humorous description  LUSUS NATUREAE TYPOGRAPHUS  Monstrum horrendum informe ingens cui lumen ademptum  VIRG  I thought some of Nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably  SHAKESPEARE  In Nature's workshop on a day  Her journeymen inclin'd to play  Half drank 'twixt cup and can  Took up a clod which see

Her action brings and thus she grounds her plea  "I never made a man but still  You acted like that man at will  Yet ever must I hope in vain  To make a man like you again"  Hence ruin'd totally by

certiorari to an other court when it appeared thus  Nature against G Defendant's Plea  For G I without a fee  'Gainst Nature thus put in his plea  "To make a man like me of art  Is not 'tis true dame Nature's part  I own that Scrub fool knave I've play'd  With more success than all my trade  But prove it plaintiff if you can  That e'er I acted like a man"  Of this we boldly make denial  Join issue

his Irish breeding  While I am acting shall that wretch be reading  Curse on all rivals or in same or profit  The Fantoccini still make something of it  What formidable rivals to the immortal ROSCIUS Harlequin Scaramouch Chimneysweeper Bassviol Astrologer Child Statue and Parrot But ROSCIUS having received a formal challenge from Mr Punch and his merry family a pitch'dbattle for which great preparations are now making will be fought between them next winter when there is no doubt but the triumphant ROSCIUS will even at their own weapons rout them all There is the less reason to fear this as he hath already exceeded even Mr's activity in King Richard It is but three or four years ago since this mockmonarch died so tamely that he was hissed off the stage on which occasion the following epigram appeared in the papers  ROSCIUS REDIVIVUS  George did'nt I hear the critics hiss  When I was dead "Yes brother yes  "You did not die in high rant"  Nay if they think a dying king  Like Harlequin convuls'd should spring  Letbe hence their tyrant  ROSCIUS however hath chang'd his mind and acquired new elastic powers in so much that the following complimentary verses appeared on the agility which he lately displayed in the performance of that character  Be dumb ye criticks dare to hiss no more  While crowded boxes pit and galleries roar  Who says that Roscius feels the hand of Time  To blast his blooming laurels in their prime  With ever supple limbs and pliant tongue  Roscius like Hebe will be ever young  See and believe your eyesdid e'er you see  So great a feat of pure agility  Nor Hughes nor Astley vaulting in the air  Like Roscius makes the struck spectators stare  Nor Lun nor Woodward ever gave the spring  He gave last night in Richard dying king  Th' immortal actor who can die so clever  In spite of fate will live to die for ever  Curse on that KENRICK  A Briton blunt bred to plain mathematics  Who hates French bgres and Italian pathics  with his caustic pen  Who scorns the hate and hates the love of MEN  Who with such force envenom'd satire writes  Deeper his ink than aquafortis  The plaintive ROSCIUS seems here to have an eye to the following lines  The wits who drink water and suck sugarcandy  Impute the strong spirit of  Kenrick  to brandy  They are not so much out the matter in short is  He sips  aquavitae  and spits  aquafortis  PUBLIC ADV  bites  Stand his perpetualmotion  This multifarious genius pretends to have discovered the Perpetual motion but it must be a mere pretence as he is weak enough to think the public ought to reward him for his discovery and offers to disclose it on the simple terms of no purchase no pay  ever still  Or if it move oh let it move up hill  The curse of Sisiphus oh let him feel  The curse of Fortune's

at first rejected as unfit for the theatre on account of having so many of Shakespeare's known characters in it tho' the manager himself afterwards brought on a pageant in which were almost all Shakespeare's known characters when finding it difficult to make any of them speak with propriety he contented himself with instructing them to bite their thumbs screw up their mouths and make faces at each other to the great edification of the audience This play indeed was afterwards almost entirely altered and got up for a performer's benefit when it was received with the greatest applause It has however never since been acted either for the author's emolument or the entertainment of the publick although the alterations were made at the instance of the manager and under his promise that if it succeeded in the representation it should be permitted to have a run  come again to life  Ne'er shall be play'd again his WIDOW'D WIFE  Another comedy nearly under the same predicament with respect to the town having been performed but once since its first run tho' received with approbation the manager in the mean while having brought on and repeatedly acted the performances of his favourite playwrights to almost empty benches and yet ROSCIUS hath all the while pretended to have the highest opinion of the talents and the greatest regard for the interest of the writerThe manager claims a legal right indeed as patentee to perform what plays he pleases but tho' the playhouse and patent be his property he has no liberal right to make at pleasure a property of the players the poets and the publick  Ne'er will I court again his stubborn Muse  But for a pageant would his play refuse  While puff and pantomime will gull the town  'Tis good to keep o'erweening merit down  IMITATIONS  Aut

my gains to him  If poor and proud can he of right complain  That wealthier men and wittier are as vain  Why must he hint that I am past my prime  To blast my fading laurels ere their time  Death to my fame and what alas is worse  'Tis death damnation to my craving purse  Capacious purse by PLUTUS form'd to hold  The God of Wealth the devil and all of gold  Insatiate purse that never yet ran o'er  But swallows all and gapes like Hell for more  And yet alas how much the world will lye  They call me miser but no miser I  He brooding o'er his bags delighted sits  And laughs to scorn the jests of

vein  With nice decorum shunning naughty jokes  Exhibit none but decent dainty folks  NYKY was employed by ROSCIUS to correct the Plaindealer of Wycherly which he accordingly attempted and inscribed the attempt to his patron "as a tribute of  affection  and esteem for his many shining and  amiable  qualities" "The licentiousness of Wycherly's muse" says this modern corrector "rendered her shocking to us with all her charms or in other words we could allow no charms in a tainted beauty who brought contagion along with her" Of the play of the Plaindealer in particular he intimates that it had been long excluded the theatre because to the honour of the present age it was immoral and indecent that on a close examination he found in it excessive obscenity that the character of Manly was rough even to outrageous brutality and that he thought it necessary to work the whole materials up again with a mixture of alloy agreeable to the rules of modern refinement SEE PREFACE TO BFF'S

cannot fawn and fetch and carry neither will I ever practise that servile complaisance which some people pique themselves on being masters of I will not whisper my contempt or hatred call a man fool or knave by signs and mouths over his shoulder while I have him in my arms I will not as you do  Plausible  As I do Heaven defend me upon my honour I never attempted to abuse or lessen any one in my life  Manly  What you were afraid  Plausible  No but seriously I hate to do a rude thing No faith I speak well of all mankind  Manly  I thought so but know that this is the worst sort of detraction for it takes away the reputation of the few good men in the world by making all alike Now I speak ill of many men because they deserve it  triumph to my sorrow  And PAPHOS rise o'er SODOM and GOMORRAH  APPENDIX  A Certain circumstance  Viz The gross publication of a direct abominable charge against ROSCIUS in the Public Ledger of June  to which the author of the foregoing piece was an utter stranger having happened about the time of its publication and given rise to rumours equally false and foreign to the writer it appears that Roscius or some of his friends was pleased to insert the following queries in the Morning Chronicle of July d  CANDOUR presents her compliments to Mr she begs his pardonto Dr  Kenrick  and desires to ask him a few simple questions to which if he be the  Plaindealer  he pretends he will give a plain and direct answer  Query  I Whether you are not the author of the eclogue entitled  Love in the Suds  as well as of the letter prefixed to it  II Whether you did not mean though you have artfully evaded the law by affecting the translation of a classical cento to throw out the most scandalous insinuations against the character of Roscius  III Whether you were not likewise the author of an infamous anonymous paragraph in a public paper for which that paper is under a just prosecution  IV Whether you have not openly acknowledged notwithstanding that you really entertained a very different opinion of Roscius  V Whether any cause of dispute that might subsist between you and Roscius can authorize so cruel so unmanly an attack  VI Whether the brother of Roscius did not personally wait on you to require in his name the satisfaction of a gentleman which you refused him  CANDOUR  To these queries the author judged it expedient to make the following reply in the same paper of July th  To CANDOUR  MADAM  Though I think your signature a misnomer to shew that I am no stranger to the name and quality you assume I shall not stand on the punctilio of your being an  anonymous  querist but answer your several questions explicitly  I I am the author of the eclogue you mention  II I did not mean to throw out the  most  scandalous insinuations on the character of Roscius nor any insinuation  more  scandalous than his conduct How far that has been so he knows best and is left to make the application  III An  infamous  paragraph I  cannot  write and an  anonymous  one I  will not  write to prejudice my greatest enemy As to that in question I have not to this hour even seen it CALUMNY I  detest  but I think  vice  should be exposed to  infamy  nor have I so much  false delicacy  as to conceive it should be treated with  tenderness  in proportion as it is  abominable  IV I have not acknowledged that I entertain a  very different  opinion of Roscius on the contrary I declare that I entertain a  very indifferent  opinion of him  V As to the cause of our dispute I should be very ready to submit it to the publick were I egotist enough to think it deserved their attention  VI The brother of Roscius  did personally wait  on me to desire I would meet "him the said Roscius who would bring a friend with him I being at liberty to do the same" but as nothing of time place or weapon was mentioned I did not look on this message as a challenge nor well could I as I never heard of requiring  gentleman's satisfaction  by  letter of attorney  and the professed end of our meeting  turned merely on a matter of businessIt is possible indeed the messenger otherwise instructed might  imagine  it such especially as it seems his head has teemed with nothing but challenges and duels since his magnanimous monomachy with one of his brother Roscius's candlesnuffersThat Roscius himself however did not mean to send me a challenge is plain from his solliciting afterwards by letter a conference in the presence only of a common friend to both a request that would have been complied with had not he thought proper in a most ungentlemanlike manner to make a confidant in the mean time of a booby of a bookseller who had the folly and impudence to declare that he would on  his  Roscius's account  take an opportunity  to do  me  some desperate mischiefLest I should be yet supposed from the purport of this last query to have any fear of a personal encounter with the doughty Roscius I require only that it may be on an equal footing I am neither so extravagantly fond of life nor think myself so consequential in it as to fear the end of it from such an antagonist nor to say the truth should I have any qualms of conscience if nothing less will satisfy him about putting an end to so insignificant a being as his but as "the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong" it is but right to provide against a mishap Roscius has a large fortune and little or no family to leave it to I have a large family and little or no fortune to leave it Let Roscius but previously settle  only half  his estate on my heirs on condition that  he  deprives them of a protector and I will meet him tomorrow and engage at his own weapons not only him but his brother George into the bargain  The above pleasantry being misconstrued by some of Roscius's friends to the disadvantage of the author the latter thought himself under the necessity of seriously acquainting the former of his being ready as he is at any time to give him such satisfaction as a gentleman who supposes himself injured has a right to require  And now Madam CANDOUR give me leave to ask  you  a question or two in my turn  Qu  I Whether from many gross instances of misbehaviour  Roscius  hath not long had sufficient reason to suspect the detestable character of  Nyky  II Whether therefore granting Roscius to be himself  immaculate  he is excusable for his notorious partialities to such a character  III Whether he has any right to complain of unjust severity in being ludicrously reproached with such partialities by a writer whom he hath treated even in favour of that very wretch with disrespect with insolence with injustice  W KENRICK  Instead of  candidly  replying however to the above three queries a very difficult task indeed to Roscius he caused the Court of King's Bench to be moved for a rule to shew cause why leave should not be given him to file an information against the author for a libel which being granted of course the same was exultingly anounced in the following paragraphs inserted in all the newspapers  Yesterday morning Mr Dunning made a motion in the Court of King's Bench for a rule to shew cause why an information should not be laid against the author of Love in the Suds When the court was pleased to grant a rule for the first day of next term The poem was read in court by the Clerk of the Crown and afforded no small diversion when it came to that part which reflects upon a certain Chief Justice who was present all the time  Besides Mr Wallace and Mr Dunning who are employed by a greatactor in his prosecution of some detestable charges which have been lately urged with  as much folly as wickedness  against his character Mr Murphy and Mr Mansfield are also engaged and the cause now becomes a matter of much expectation with the publick  To these paragraphs the author judged it necessary to make the following reply in the abovementioned Morning Chronicle almost all the rest of the newspapers by the indefatigable industry  and powerful influence of Roscius a proprietor in most of them being shut against him  The AUTHOR of LOVE in the SUDS to the PRINTER of the MORNING CHRONICLE  SIR  In reprehending the faults of other men you should ever be cautious of falling into the error you condemn In yesterday's paper you indirectly charge me among others with having "urged a detestable charge with as much folly as wickedness against a certain great actor"What other people have done I know not nor does it concern me but I may safely defy all the Lawyers in WestminsterHall fairly to deduce such a charge as you hint at from the eclogue in question In this respect it is certainly as innocent as the great actor's Jubilee Ode But granting it otherwise with any one else how can you take upon you to say that such a charge is urged  foolishly and wickedly  Can  you  know it to be false or groundless And if not on what grounds do you charge the accusers with  folly  and  wickedness  Why does not the CANDOUR of the great actor reply to the Queries put to him in your paper of Saturday last But no unable to justify himself at the bar of the publick he flies for refuge to the quirks and quibbles of WestminsterHall and even this at the latter end of a term in order to deceive the town into a notion that the court will countenance his prosecution Why was not his motion made sooner that cause might have been shewn in time and the futility of it made immediately evident Believe me Sir before an end is put to this business the publick will be better enabled to judge on which side the  folly and wickedness  lies than you appear to do at present  I am yours c W K  THE POETICAL ALTERCATION BETWEEN BENEDICK and BEATRICE EXTRACTED FROM THE MORNING CHRONICLE  KK whom we

GARRICK has illtreated KEN  Give me good dame I humbly crave you  A hearing for my fav'rite  Davy  I've my objectionslet me start 'em  The rule is "  audi alteram partem"  Some years ago an honest fellow  As ever with sheer sack was mellow  Who long has plac'd his hopes his all in  The gains of  histrionic  calling  Who now is  journeyman  now  master  Oh may he never meet disaster  Was offer'd for the truth ask KEN of it  Jack Falstaff's Wedding for his benefit  LOVE who at genius is no scoffer  Makes KEN a bow accepts his offer  The piece was play'd  the audience claw'd it  Not they nor did they much applaud it  But as it 'scap'd the  trial ordeal  To Kk's spirits 'twas a cordial  He bounc'd look'd big and swell'd his vanity  Was not to be restrain'd by any tie  He swore his comedy might claim a  Precedence in the  British  drama  Its flights so high its wit so  attic  'Twou'd crown him  king  of bards dramatic  Happy for KEN had  Drury  's sultan  Esteem'd his  bantling  an  adult  one  Butfatal to the sale of tickets  He said the  child  had got the  rickets  Tho' some  few features  in't were sprightly  Yet altogether 'twas  unsightly  Howe'er to soften KEN's displeasure  For disappointed  same  and  treasure  He  charitably  stood his patron  And brought him out the  Widow'd  Matron  Than Falstaff's Wedding  heavier  bruited  Yet to the  reigning  taste more suited  Some years elaps'd the doughty KEN  Applies to  Drury  's Chief again  He shook his head and screw'd his phyz hard  The  Widow'd Wife  stuck in his gizzard  "Must I cries he place in my

your friend will grace the pillory  And as he has prepar'd the  Suds  My wish is the  plebean  bloods  May recompence the  scribbling  adder  By giving him a hearty  lather  BENEDICK  To BENEDICK  KEN  vow'd revenge made  fame  his Pandar  Hell shudder'd at the horrid slander  BENEDICK  HA Benedick and are you there  Caught in your own designing snare  Doth Kk's eclogue say no more  Than  common same  had said before  So horrid  is't become the crime  To turn the towntalk into rhime  To hint in dark and distant terms  What foulmouth'd rumour loud affirms  Is satire only too severe  When more is meant than meets the ear  So cruel is't to speak not out  But leave avow'd report in doubt  Fame  is we know a lying strumpet  And yet the muses blow her trumpet  Your lines would else not run so glib  At ev'ry second word a fib  Lying 'tis therefore plain in thy sense  Is founded on poetic licence  A falshood all that you relate  Of Falstaff's Wedding and its fate  Of Gk's patronizing charity  How ill bestow'd so great a rarity  Tho' Kk e'er had too much pride  To kiss a manager's backside  Shunn'd with vile Nyky to be seen  In Gk's train behind the scene  Yet not so far the world above  His labour to give up for  Love  His lawful right he still maintains  To what he claim'd as honest gains  Nor this alone the secret cause  Why Kk his dread goosequill draws  Let others crouch but while a man  He never will forgive nor can  'Till full redress'd on fair confession  A bare affront or base oppression  Much less will he restrain his pen  In fear of wretches less than men  That pen which truth excites to gall  Both the great vulgar and the small  The scourge of guilt when Justice claims  Its aid against the greatest names  Much less will he its aid refuse  Or tamely check his daring muse  Because a stageplay'r stalks abroad  Whose antic tricks the crowd applaud  By his profession dead to shame  And trusting to theatric fame  Presumptuous that our English laws  Perverted to avenge his cause  The freeborn muse in chains will bind  Disgraceful unto human kind  Of ridicule will check the vein  And satire's wholesome power restrain  That Vice and Folly thus set free  May laugh at future infamy  No Sir next Term indeed or Hillary  May bring your Nyky to the pillory  Securely as you think he's closetted  And safe from law's pursuit deposited  But think not the indignant town  Will let his farces still go down  Or that with such a hateful croney  You still may share the public money  Attempt it not lest in a rage  The audience drive thee from the stage  BEATRICE  To Dr  K    DOCTOR I have been out of town or  This packet would have reach'd you sooner  Prithee pull off your mask for no man  Should injure that dear creature  woman  In Beatrice you give a handle  To fix on the dear sex a scandal  What lady would take up goose quill in  Defence of such a slanderous villain  At the word Fame you closely nibble  And strive by  jesuitic  quibble  T' explain away an  obvious  meaning  An art that  Ken  was always keen in  Thus a Solicitor who daily  Attends the sessions at Old Bailey  In fraud deep skill'd to law a nuisance  Will catch a word pervert its true sense  To save a thoroughpac'd and callous  Offender from his duethe gallows  You tax as  false  what I relate  "Of  Falstaff's Wedding  and its fate"  But will a Kenrick's  ipse dixit  Blast my report and falsehood fix it  No Doctor he that knows us both  Will trust  my word  before  your oath  The Comedy howe'er you laud it  I told you  was not much applauded  Many can witness my assertion  Is truth not envy nor aspersion  Love's  friends and  your's  were all agreed in  The  celebration  of  Jack's Wedding  Or possibly the critic clans  Had stepp'd into  forbid the bans  If on the town again you'd push'd it  Another audience might have crush'd it  That play whose only merit lies  In  imitation  scarce can  rise  You rail at  Bick  with all my heart  Think you I mean to take his part  Think you I would one distich write  T'exculpate a vile se  No on him let thy rage be hurl'd  Nolash him naked thro' the world  Expose in satire's keenest lays  This skulking damn'd detested race  Hang up to publick scorn each brute  Who dares Love's rites to prostitute  But never tax in prose or rhyme  The guiltless with so black a crime  Your hints to celebrated Garry  Seem useless and unnecessary  Davy is whata man of prudence  Now mark what comment I obtrudehence  He would deserve a cane or thicker staff  To favour  in futuro  Bickerstaff  For should a brat the town be sibb'd on  Father'd by Paul compil'd by Dibden  The secret could he hope to smother  No it would out some time or other  Then hey what havock rage and fury  Would reign tumultuous at old Drury  Down go the boxes up the benches  The scenes are fir'dhow great the stench is  By h each British fair would fly out  And eager join the general riot  Wives widows maids turn warlike Knights  T' avenge their  broken Bill of Rights  'Twere just for sure no  backdoor  cub like  Vile Bick should profit by the public  Doctor I mean this rhyming letter  The last for which you'll be my debtor  In friendship's name I therefore crave you  To make it up with injur'd  Davy  Your heart of envious spleen a mass call  And own yourself a sland'rous rascal  Speak truth for once and shame the Devil  Shame my old Friend 'twould be uncivil  Pho he'll excuse you on that score  You never made him  blush before  You think I'm Drury's stagedirector  Upon my honour mere conjecture  I've put on Benedick's disguise  To be conceal'd from critic spies  And Garrick knows no more than Bick  Or Ken the name of  BENEDICK  To BENEDICK  THUS costive bards themselves excuse  And lay the fault upon the muse  A slattern rambling up and down  That when they're dull is out of town  But come for once we'll let it pass  A witling is sometimes an ass
