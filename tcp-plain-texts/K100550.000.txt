o'erwhelmn them  SHAKESPEAR  LONDON  Printed and sold by W REEVE in  FleetStreet  M DCC LV  AN ACCOUNT OF  BARBAROSSA  The USURPER of  ALGIERS  _AS the Curiosity of the Publick has been of late much engaged in Enquiries after the NEW TRAGEDY of  BARBAROSSA  which is soon to be perform'd at the Theatre Royal in  DruryLane  and as several Gentlemen of Eminence in the Republick of Letters have been mention'd  as the Author it may perhaps be agreeable to the Town to have the following short Account given of the previous History of that fam'd Usurper from whom the Tragedy takes it's Name  While the memorable Cardinal XIMENEZ was Minister in  Spain  King FERDINAND the Fifth of  Arragon  about the Year sent PETER Count of  Navarre  with a powerful Force which without Difficulty took  Oran  The Inhabitants of this famous City in general were  Moors  which had been forc'd out of  Granada  and  Valentia  about twelve Years before  These being a bold and active People and being well vers'd in the Manners as well as Language of the  Spaniards  did considerable Damage both by Sea and Land to the Dependents of that Crown  From  Oran  the  Spaniards  flush'd with Success pursu'd their Conquest and took  Bugia  and many other Places with heroic Valour The  Algerines  being apprehensive their City would undergo the same Fate sent for Assistance by Way of Caution to SELIM EUTEMI a Prince of  Arabian  Extraction famous for Skill in military Affairs He accepted their Invitation  and came with a large Number of valiant Followers which he had selected from that populous Nation and encamp'd upon the Plain of  Mutija  where he had Power attended also by his Wife ZAPHIRA a Lady of great Worth and Virtue and his Son SELIM not then twelve Years old whom he was fond of initiating into the Exercise of War  Notwithstanding this Succour another Fleet and more Troops from FERDINAND quickly subdu'd the City of  Algiers  and oblig'd it to pay Tribute and even suffer'd the  Spaniards  to build a Fort and man it with some of the best Troops on a small Island that lay opposite the City to the great Injury of the  Algerine Corsairs  who could not with Safety go out and in the Harbour  This however disagreeable they bore with Patience 'till the Death of FERDINAND in the Year which put them then upon an Attempt to recover their Liberties  They sent Deputies to ARACH BARBAROSSA a  Mahometan Corsair  born at  Mcteline  in the  Archipelago  of great Fame for his Bravery and his Success in  Battle He was upon a Cruise with his Squardron when the  Algerine  Deputies met him with their Request to assist them to throw off the  Spanish  Yoke promising him great Dignities to his Person and large Gratification for such Service He gave the Deputies a most favourable Answer and sent them back to  Algiers  to carry Joy to their dejected Countrymen  BARBAROSSA immediately sent eighteen Gallies and a Number of Barks to  Algiers  while he march'd by Land collecting all the  Moors  and  Turks  that seem'd inclin'd to assist his Enterprize and was so successful in his Levies that the  Algerines  thought the Hour of Deliverance was at Hand  SELIM EUTEMI General of  Algiers  with many of the chief Officers and principal Citizens went two Days Journey to meet him and brought him with great Honours in Triumph into their City conducting him amidst the Shouts of the People to the Palace of SELIM EUTEMI Where he was nobly receiv'd while his Army met with great Indulgence from the rejoic'd  Algerines  which they soon abus'd and claim'd by Force what was first given them through Courtesy  BARBAROSSA too being of an ambitious Nature form'd a wicked Design of making himself Sovereign of  Algiers  and all its Provinces His Officers applauded his Design promis'd to assist in it and swore themselves to Secrecy 'till a Time happen'd to put it in Execution In order to begin Commotions BARBAROSSA wink'd at the Insolence and Villanies of the  Turkish  Soldiers who were perpetually raising Disorders in the City which he hop'd might enrage the Citizens to some desperate Act that might favour his Design  SELIM EUTEMI now discover'd his Indiscretion in calling BARBAROSSA in to his Assistance For so insolent was this Pirate that he treated the Prince with Contempt never asking his Advice in any Thing but built Forts attack'd the  Spanish  Castle and all without his Knowledge or Consent  The Citizens too plainly perceiv'd his Design and made no Scruple of declaring their Sentiments BARBAROSSA finding himself suspected gave Way to his Fury which was heighten'd by a Passion he had entertain'd for SELIM's Wife the fair ZAPHIRA He therefore determin'd  to make short Work of it and by the Death of SELIM satisfy at once his Ambition and his Love For he did not doubt but upon her Husband's Death ZAPHIRA would listen to his Suit and consent to marry him which Alliance would add Dignity to him and his own mean Extraction be hid by the Union with this Lady who was related to most of the powerful Cheques of the  Arabians  who if the  Algerines  should oppose would for his Wife's sake assist to establish him upon the Throne  BARBAROSSA having fixt his Scheme waited an Opportunity of SELIM's being alone in a Bath when he rush'd upon him and slew him He fell down in the Bath where the Water finish'd what his Hurry had imperfectly done The Pirate hasten'd out and collecting some of his Friends return'd to the Bath under Pretence of cooling himself as usual where with an affected Surprize he shew'd SELIM dead This was soon spread throughout the City and BARBAROSSA under Pretence of discovering any foul Play that might have been us'd to SELIM put all the Soldiers under Arms with Orders to secure every Pass 'till he could consider further on this Accident  The Citizens of  Algiers  notwithstanding the Reports given out look'd upon the Death of SELIM to be a Stroke of the inhuman BARBAROSSA's and dreading the further Mischief they suspected he had plan'd lock'd themselves in their Houses which gave the  Turkish  Army full Power to distress and spoil at PleasureThey immediately conducted BARBAROSSA in Pomp to SELIM's Palace proclaiming him King of  Algiers  adding  Destruction to all Opposers of him that Heaven has chosen for our Deliverer and Protector  These Menaces alarm'd the Citizens with most dreadful Apprehensions BARBAROSSA was seated under a Canopy surrounded with his Adherents and Guards while proper Officers were sent to the principal Inhabitants requiring them in the Name of the new King to attend and take the Oath of Allegiance before him promising great Marks of Favour and Rewards to those who shew'd themselves most ready to perform the Ceremony In this Exigency the Citizens who apprehended immediate Death would follow their Refusal suffer'd themselves to be brought to the Palace where after the King had repeated his magnificent Promises they took the  Oaths and sign'd the Instrument for his Coronation  BARBAROSSA having thus far obtain'd his End order'd the Inhabitants to go quietly about their several Callings and depend upon his Care for their Protection Prince SELIM's Son with Reason apprehending he was not long to survive his Father's Murder found Means to fly with only two Servants to  Oran  and beg Protection from  Spain  The Marquis DE GOMAREZ Governor of the Place receiv'd him with all the Respect and Honour due to his Birth and Youth  BARBAROSSA being thus settled on the Throne caus'd all the Fortifications of  Algiers  to be repair'd and plac'd in them strong Garrisons of  Turkish  Soldiers whom he paid well with Money he had coin'd in his own Name  The People soon felt the Grievances of BARBAROSSA's Usurpation for where he had the least Suspicion he seiz'd upon the Effects of the Subjects Others that had secreted their Money were put to Death while he and his Associates revell'd in their Property  While Affairs were in this Situation BARBAROSSA began his Addresses to the Princess ZAPHIRA who rejected them with the utmost Disdain for she look'd upon him as the Murderer of her Husband and expecting her Contempt of him would enrage him to attempt some Violence she always carry'd a Dagger with her fully resolv'd if she could not revenge herself on him to save her Virtue at the Price of her own Life  BARBAROSSA however furious by Nature did not immediately resent ZAPHIRA's Behaviour but looking on her excessive Grief to proceed from her Husband's Death resolv'd to forbear his Visits for awhile and let Time restore her Mind to Temper when he did not doubt but to perswade her to share his CrownHe made her a Present of some beautiful Slaves some of which were instructed to let him know what pass'd in the Princess's Apartment  ZAPHIRA's Grief was too violent to continue and her Transports began to settle into a compos'd and silent Sorrow Reflection took Place and finding it impossible  to revenge the Death of SELIM she resolv'd to request the Usurper to let her retire into her own Country  BARBAROSSA hearing the Princess was grown more moderate in her Grief sent her a Letter full of the highest Praises of her Beauty and the Adoration he paid to it offering to share his Crown with her and beseeching her to forget all former Miseries and rise to Joy upon the Throne he wish'd her to adorn  One of the Slaves that BARBAROSSA had presented the Princess with was entrusted to deliver this Letter to her but what was her Surprize when she read these Offers made by one who was the Murderer of her Husband All her former Agitations were renew'd but at length a little recollecting herself she consulted with her faithful Women how to behave in such a dreadful Exigency It was now resolv'd that she should send a soothing Answer back as Rage would prove vain against Power and by flattering the Tyrant obtain Permission to retire to the Plains of  Mutija  her native Country and urge for Reason of her refusing the Crown her Detestatio  of the Place where her Lord was murder'd  BARBAROSSA found by this Epistle that she suspected him as Accessary to SELIM's Death but in order to clear himself and put an End to ZAPHIRA's Imaginations he summon'd his chief Counsellor and Instrument in the Death of SELIM RAMADAN CHOULAH and told him As the Princess suspected he was concern'd in the Prince's Murder that in order to acquit himself he must procure some Victims to turn ZAPHIRA's Thoughts  RAMADAN easily came into this Project and order'd it to be proclaim'd That the King being inform'd that SELIM had a violent Death and that he himself was suspected to be privy to it his Orders were that any Person who knew or suspected the Murderers should immediately discover them on Pain of Death and Tortures promising at the same Time great Rewards to the Informer  It was not long before an Informer who had been practis'd upon made a Discovery He declar'd That a Domestic of Prince SELIM's had told him before he left  Algiers  the Names of the Accomplices adding that they were under an Oath to  suffer Death rather than betray the Secret if BARBAROSSA had miscarried but that he being at present the Sovereign they had nothing to fear though it should be publickly known This Wretch who was in the Prince's Service receiv'd the Reward but at the same Time the King order'd his Tongue to be pull'd out under Pretence of his not revealing it sooner but indeed that he might not discover the Treachery  The pretended Accomplices to the Number of Thirty were brought before the King who were some of the poorest Soldiers in BARBAROSSA's Army and had been wrought upon by RAMADAN in order to clear the King publickly to consess themselves guilty assuring them of great Rewards for the Service and tho' they should be put in Prison yet Means should be found to convey them safe to  Aegypt  to spend their Lives in Peace and Plenty  These poor Men could not resist such Promises but consented and when they were call'd upon answer'd to every Question and own'd their Guilt upon which they were immediately strangled One of them out of Revenge to RAMADAN who  had so deluded them cry'd out before he dy'd  That Prince  SELIM  was murder'd by the Order of  RAMADAN whom the King order'd that Instant to meet the same Fate the other Wretches had suffer'd Thus did this wicked Man fall by his own Contrivance and was destroy'd by that Power which he had been the chief Instrument to establish  BARBAROSSA had the Bodies of these Wretches drag'd round the City and their Heads fixt upon the Battlements of the Palace and did not doubt but the Confessions of these Criminals would convince ZAPHIRA as well as all the Citizens that he was innocent of Prince SELIM's Death And indeed many acquitted him of being any Ways concern'd in the Murder  With this Assurance he sent again to the Princess again invited her to his Throne and pleaded as some Merit the Discovery he had made of SELIM's Murderers and the Justice he had executed upon them  But ZAPHIRA was too penetrating to be so deceiv'd She again refus'd his  Offers adding His Power could not bestow any Thing worth her Acceptance unless it was the Liberty of retiring to her own Country  This Intercourse of assiduous Courtship and steady Refusal continu'd by Fits for some Years during which Time BARBAROSSA was frequently call'd from  Algiers  by his Ambition in defending the Territories he had usurped and inlarging them by new Conquests In the mean Time having got Notice that young SELIM had taken Refuge in  Oran  he secretly dispatch'd a bold Assassin who should destroy the young Prince whom he regarded as the greatest Obstacle to his safe Possession of the Throne  While this Design was in Agitation he return'd triumphant over his Enemies to  Algiers  and being at once tired and provoked with ZAPHIRA's repeated Delays he now bethought himself of using that Power he was possessed of and resolved in Case of another Refusal to compel her to a Marriage  Somewhere about this Period if ou  Accounts are true the Tragedy begins  How the Poet may conduct his Plan or what Use he may make of these Materials we presume not to conjecture Nor indeed if we were acquainted with his Design would we anticipate the Spectator's Pleasure by making it publickBut by the Policy of the Managers the Conduct of this Tragedy is as much a Secret as either the Name of the Author or the subsequent Part of the History itself  FINIS
