 ILLUMINATION OR THE GLAZIERS' CONSPIRACY A PRELUDE AS IT IS PERFORMED WITH UNIVERSAL APPLAUSE AT THE THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN BY F PILON  LONDON PRINTED FOR G KEARSLEY AT No IN FLEET STREET MDCCLXXIX  Entered at Stationershall  ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER  THE Author of the following trifle is as fully satisfied of the small claim it has to public attention as the best  critical anatomist  in town could make himbut as the country managers procure copies of every piece play'd with success in London that is not published he is unwilling to have the number of his faults increased through the blunders and inaccuracies of an ignorant  shorthand writer He therefore presents his little offspring to the reader as it came into the world for though a  parent  may find no great beauty in a child few I fancy are so  unnatural  as so stand by and see one knocked o'the head or get a broken limb without making some effort to prevent the accident  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  MEN

Sophia zounds can't you call her plain Sue as she was christened  MRS SKYLIGHT  I see Mr Skylight you will never get rid of your vulgar ideras notwithstanding all the pains I take with you  SKYLIGHT  But what right have you to give your daughter a higher name than plain Kate Bridget or Susan Are'nt these think you good enough for a tradesman's wife as she must be If you don't keep a tighter rein with that girl Bridget she'll resemble her betters in more respects than her name ay and if ever she gets a husband will put him in the fashion as well as herself or I'm out in my calculation  MRS SKYLIGHT  Why my dear wasn't she baptiz'd Susannah Sophia Serina  SKYLIGHT  Much against my will She was call'd Susannah after her grandmother and damme if I was a bishop but I'd pluck the blockhead's cassock  over his ears who tack'd the other two heathenish nonsensical additions to itBut don't sit chatting nonsense all night over that slop go to the shop and see the customers ar'nt neglectedI expect a few panes knockt out in the beginning of the evening and people don't care to let 'em stand all night without mending  MRS SKYLIGHT  You may look after the customers yourself Sophy and I are

kingdom so I cou'd get quit of your indentures  MRS SKYLIGHT  Come Sophy we'll leave him to recover from his tantrums  going  You see child what you have to expect if you marry a man who has no idera of the foster commotions and whose heart is more indurate than the glass which he glazes  Exeunt Sophy and Mrs Skylight  SKYLIGHT  So off they go to that puppy Quillet the lawyer's clerk and Abraham Skylight has seen the last of them 'till tomorrow morning  Sits down in a melancholy posture  Why did I marry Was it not as clear as plateglass that a prudent glazier cou'd never live in peace with a woman of  her confounded extravagant turbulent spirit Is there one part of her marriage vow she has not broken Yes let me do her justice her chastity that I look upon to be a whole pane yet and I fancy while her present head continues upon her shoulders it is a pane few will think worth smashing  Enter  DIP  DIP  What in the dumps friend Skylight  SKYLIGHT  I have been thinking Dip what windows will be broke 'twixt this and five tomorrow morning  DIP  Ay always an eye to business but what was done last nightAny great strokes struck  SKYLIGHT  Great strokes I and my apprentices struck

them from the Cat and Gridiron at Ratcliffe Highway to the Highlander and Bagpipe at Tyburn turnpike  SKYLIGHT  How was the City  DIP  A bonfire from Temple Bar to the Minories  SKYLIGHT  How was the Strand  DIP  For all the world like a bundle of matches lighted a blaze all above and brimstone all below  SKYLIGHT  How was Bowstreet  DIP  I can't tell for there was a file of musketeers at both

The first night but a confounded Whig  erly wind blew the candles out so the de  was droptbut to the siegefrom Cha  g Cross to Downingstreet the mob stow'd as  as a barrel of Colchester oysters But

I was af  to trust to the Scotch pavement But did  hear of any accident in the course of  night  DIP  Why yes a shortsighted gentleman was high having his eyes burnt out passing the General Advertiser because he did'nt illuminate his spectaclesand a coach full of ladies had like to have been burnt down to the ground opposite the London Tavern owing to a squib which was thrown into one of the women's heads and raised such a conflagration in a few seconds amongst the wool gauze pomatum and false hair she had on that there was a hole burnt through the top of the coach before the flames could be got under  Enter  DICK  DICK  Lord Sir you'll lose all the fun if you do'nt go out  SKYLIGHT  What you rascal have you left the shop and not a journeyman in the house but yourself  DICK  Why Sir
