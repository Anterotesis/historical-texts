 AN ELEGY WROTE IN A Country Church Yard  LONDON Printed for R DODSLEY in  Pallmall  And sold by M COOPER in  PaternosterRow  Price Sixpence  Advertisement  THE following  POEM  came into my Hands by Accident if the general Approbation with which this little Piece has been spread may be call'd by so slight a Term as Accident It is this Approbation which makes it unnecessary for me to make any Apology but to the Author As he cannot but feel some Satisfaction in having pleas'd so many Readers already I flatter myself he will forgive my communicating that Pleasure to many more  The EDITOR  AN ELEGY  c  THE  Curfeu  tolls the Knell of parting Day  The lowing Herd winds slowly o'er the Lea  The Plowman homeward plods his weary Way  And leaves the World to Darkness and to me  Now fades the glimmering Landscape on the Sight  And all the Air a solemn Stillness holds  Save where the Beetle wheels his droning Flight  And drowsy Tinklings lull the distant Folds  Save that from yonder Ivymantled Tow'r  The mopeing Owl does to the Moon complain  Of such as wand'ring near her sacred Bow'r  Molest her ancient solitary Reign  Beneath those rugged Elms that YewTree's Shade  Where heaves the Turf in many a mould'ring Heap  Each in his narrow Cell for ever laid  The rude Forefathers of the Hamlet sleep  The breezy Call of Incensebreathing Morn  The Swallow twitt'ring from the Strawbuilt Shed  The Cock's shrill Clarion or the ecchoing Horn  No more shall wake them from their lowly Bed  For them no more the blazing Hearth shall burn  Or busy Houswife ply her Evening Care  No Children run to lisp their Sire's Return  Or climb his Knees the envied Kiss to share  Oft did the Harvest to their Sickle yield  Their Furrow oft the stubborn Glebe has broke  How jocund did they they drive their Team afield  How bow'd the Woods beneath their sturdy Stroke  Let not Ambition mock their useful Toil  Their homely Joys and Destiny obscure  Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful Smile  The short and simple Annals of the Poor  The Boast of Heraldry the Pomp of Pow'r  And all that Beauty all that Wealth e'er gave  Awaits alike th' inevitable Hour  The Paths of Glory lead but to the Grave  Forgive ye Proud th' involuntary Fault  If Memory to these no Trophies raise  Where thro' the longdrawn Isle and fretted Vault  The pealing Anthem swells the Note of Praise  Can storied Urn or animated Bust  Back to its Mansion call the fleeting Breath  Can Honour's Voice provoke the silent Dust  Or Flatt'ry sooth the dull cold Ear of Death  Perhaps in this neglected Spot is laid  Some Heart once pregnant with celestial Fire  Hands that the Reins of Empire might have sway'd  Or wak'd to Extacy the living Lyre  But Knowledge to their Eyes her ample Page  Rich with the Spoils of Time did ne'er unroll  Chill Penury repress'd their noble Rage  And froze the genial Current of the Soul  Full many a Gem of purest Ray serene  The dark unfathom'd Caves of Ocean bear  Full many a Flower is born to blush unseen  And waste its Sweetness on the desart Air  Some Village  Hampden  that with dauntless Breast  The little Tyrant of his Fields withstood  Some mute inglorious  Milton  here may rest  Some  Cromwell  guiltless of his Country's Blood  Th' Applause of list'ning Senates to command  The Threats of Pain and Ruin to despise  To scatter Plenty o'er a smiling Land  And read their Hist'ry in a Nation's Eyes  Their Lot forbad nor circumscrib'd alone  Their growing Virtues but their Crimes confin'd  Forbad to wade through Slaughter to a Throne  And shut the Gates of Mercy on Mankind  The struggling Pangs of conscious Truth to hide  To quench the Blushes of ingenuous Shame  Or heap the Shrine of Luxury and Pride  With Incense kindled at the Muse's Flame  Far from the madding Crowd's ignoble Strife  Their sober Wishes never learn'd to stray  Along the cool sequester'd Vale of Life  They kept the noiseless Tenor of their Way  Yet ev'n these Bones from Insult to protect  Some frail Memorial still erected nigh  With uncouth Rhimes and shapeless Sculpture deck'd  Implores the passing Tribute of a Sigh  Their Name their Years spelt by th' unletter'd Muse  The Place of Fame and Elegy supply  And many a holy Text around she strews  That teach the rustic Moralist to dye  For who to dumb Forgetfulness a Prey  This pleasing anxious Being e'er resign'd  Left the warm Precincts of the chearful Day  Nor cast one longing ling'ring Look behind  On some fond Breast the parting Soul relies  Some pious Drops the closing Eye requires  Ev'n from the Tomb the Voice of Nature cries  Awake and faithful to her wonted Fires  For thee who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead  Dost in these Lines their artless Tale relate  If chance by lonely Contemplation led  Some hidden Spirit shall inquire thy Fate  Haply some hoaryheaded Swain may say  'Oft have we seen him at the Peep of Dawn  'Brushing with hasty Steps the Dews away  'To meet the Sun upon the upland Lawn  'There at the Foot of yonder nodding Beech  'That wreathes its old fantastic Roots so high  'His listless Length at Noontide wou'd he stretch  'And pore upon the Brook that babbles by  'Hard by yon Wood now frowning as in Scorn  'Mutt'ring his wayward Fancies he wou'd rove  'Now drooping woeful wan like one forlorn  'Or craz'd with Care or cross'd in hopeless Love  'One Morn I miss'd him on the custom'd Hill  'Along the Heath and near his fav'rite Tree  'Another came nor yet beside the Rill  'Nor up the Lawn nor at the Wood was he  'The next with Dirges due in sad Array  'Slow thro' the Churchway Path we saw him born  'Approach and read for thou can'st read the Lay  'Grav'd on the Stone beneath yon aged Thorn  The EPITAPH  HERE rests his Head upon the Lap of Earth  A Youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown  Fair Science frown'd not on his humble Birth  And Melancholy mark'd him for her own  Large was his Bounty and his Soul sincere  Heav'n did a Recompence as largely send  He gave to Mis'ry all he had a Tear  He gain'd from Heav'n 'twas all he wish'd a Friend  No farther seek his Merits to disclose  Or draw his Frailties from their dread Abode  There they alike in trembling Hope repose  The Bosom of his Father and his God  FINIS
