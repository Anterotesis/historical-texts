 THE PUPIL OF PLEASURE  VOL I  THE PUPIL OF PLEASURE OR The New System Illustrated INSCRIBED  To Mrs EUGENIA STANHOPE  EDITOR OF LORD CHESTERFIELD's LETTERS  By COURTNEY MELMOTH  Versatile ingenium VOL I  LONDON  Printed for G ROBINSON and J BEW in PaterNosterRow  PREFACE  SINCE the first publication of the late Earl of CHESTERFIELD'S Letters to the present time the arrows of Censure have been levelled at the doctrine they inculcate from every quarter the wit hath had his joke the versifier his parody the moralist his opposing sentiment and the divine  his grave dissertation Very ingenious men have taken the pen in hand to confront his Lordship his Graces have been smartly ridiculed his etiquette humorously exposed and Mr HUNTER with an elegance and profundity far beyond the rest of his remarkers hath penetrated into the very bottom of his maxims traversed him through every double and examined his whole system with an analytical acuteness  It is matter of real amazement that amongst all those who have expressed themselves loudly and diametrically against the doctrine of  Lord CHESTERFIELD'S correspondence none should have yet thought of the only method that was most likely to manifest their tendency The general stigma upon these Letters has been that they are calculated to recommend deceit and to conceal the most destructive hypocrisy under the smiling aspect plausible exterior fairseeming sentiments and a complacent flexibility  In an age of voluptuousness it is most obvious to apprehension that maxims like these would have most weight with the young and dissipated The man of fashion  would find them so consistent with his plan of security that there would be little doubt but he would adopt them and the man of expedient and broken fortunes would as eagerly catch at a mode of conduct which without either danger of his neck or character might repair his purse promote his pleasures and save him from a thousand shocks that poverty is heir to  The essence of my Lord CHESTERFIELD'S system seems to be neither more nor less than this Secure yourself from being blasted as he terms it and do whatever  you think proper whatever fancy passion whim or wickedness suggest only command your countenance check your temper and throw before your heart and bosom the shield of Dissimulation and snatch itseize itenjoy it  In regard to womennever surely issued from the press a collection of hints so capable of being turned to their destruction and the sex ought to be more alarmed at this publication which however one of their own sex has ushered into the world than at any thing that ever was pointed at their peace of mind or purity of character  How then hath it happened that no person hath yet put the volumes of the Earl of CHESTERFIELD into the hand of a hero who with a natural aptitude to enjoy every thing within his observation might increase his felicity very considerably by the assistance of sentiments so admirably suited to multiply mischief and to ensure his victory over that simplicity that beauty and that softness which would thence be so much the more easily  thrown off their guard  As nothing of this kind however has appeared I have ventured  to present to the public the adventures of a man of birth rank figure and character ardent in the pursuit of pleasures and much delighted  with  and attracted  by  the theory of Lord CHESTERFIELD He purchases the books finds them agreeable to his palate studies them paragraph by paragraph thrives under his application piques himself upon his progress and in the end a master of his science invokes the genius of his noble preceptor puts money in his purse the inestimable volumes in his portmanteau and sallies into the gay world armed at all points the PUPIL OF PLEASURE  Every ingenious precept laid down by the noble Lord this highbred young gentleman reduces to practice who taking the summer before him makes his attacks at a place of fashionable resort where fixing with commendable and preinstructed acuteness upon proper objects he begins to exemplify and is as successful as the politest casuist could possibly wish  In the course of this historical illustrationthis biographical commentary on the text of CHESTERFIELDample scope has been allowed for the display of various characters and particularly such as  more immediately promoted the main design of the work which is to shew the aggravated evils in society arising from the practice of such  perniciouslypleasing precepts  To this end I have made great use of the noble Lord's maxims rules and admonitions upon various subjects The incidents it is conceived arise naturally out of the principles that produce them the contrast in the characters especially of HOMESPUN SEDLEY THORNTON Lieutenant VERNON and Sir HENRY DELMORE I have endeavoured to render eminent and  conspicuous and altho' some may think the catastrophe and a few of the circumstances carried too far into the pathetic yet I am persuaded those who weigh deeply the  precepts  of Lord CHESTERFIELD will agree with me in thinking that if pushed into  practice  by an adventurer like that which his Lordship  would  have formed out of Mr STANHOPE similar or even greater sorrows and vices would invade the community In short this history is calculated strongly to prove the truth of Lord CHESTERFIELD'S  own  observation namely "That the adoption of Vice is  likely to ruin ten times more young men than natural inclination"  I am apt to think Mr STANHOPE'S reputed want of  ability  made him die an honest though an undistinguished man perhaps if he had had  Ton  enough to follow the advice of his father and entered into all the  elevated connexions  recommended to him he had fallen like the hero of this history equally celebrated dazzling and diabolical  THE PUPIL OF PLEASURE  c  LETTER I SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  Buxton  THE whirl of wheels a fine flow of spirits the elysium of expectation and the vigour of fresh horses at every stage brought me in less than twenty hours from Cavendishsquare to the place of date Having no unnecessary luggage  to retard me no trifling petit maitre who at two miles distance from the shiftingplace drives back for his gloves his cane his snuffbox or his white handkerchief I rolled THORNTON on the springs of expedition and I sit down unsubdued by fatigue to tell thee of my safety  Richardson's a child his Grandison is a monster his Lovelace a bungler since the days of Adam Nature hath produced but  one man of pleasure  and that wonder was reserved to adorn the age before us  Oh CHESTERFIELD CHESTERFIELD  thou  only thou knewest the  science  of joy thou only hadst the skill to cover the ruggednesses of life with roses that bloom from being pressed Deign then immortal shade to look with a gentle eye upon thy pupil teach me to emulate  thy genius to practise thy precepts to hit with a felicity like thine the true spirit of dissimulationsoften my features to the blandishments of delight attune my tongue to the thrillings of persuasion enrich my sentiments with so versatile a ductility that I may obey the occasions of the minuteendue me with perseverance of soul and condescend to guide me with all thy attendant graces assiduities and elegant attentions into the bosom of voluptuousness my Friend my Mentor my Genius and my God  THORNTON I am inspired the rhapsody of my invocation is throbbing already at my heartit is working its way to the very marrow in the bones The divine Letters of our Earl are this instant brought in by the postilion who is unconscious of the treasure with which he is freighted and I dare not proceed till I  have unlocked my hoard and with a more than Persian prostration paid to the maxims by which I am to be conducted the incense of my idolatry  Adieu adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER II  Mr  THORNTON  to Mr  SEDLEY  TAKE care it is easier to advise than to act I wish you joy of your system which I approve let it not however appear to be  imitation  and the deities of bliss throw objects in your way  Farewel JAMES THORNTON  P S  Be explicit in your letters  LETTER III SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  DULL THORNTONcircumspect citizen at what art thou alarmed and "why is thy spirit troubled within thee" How canst thou entertain so contemptible a notion of thy SEDLEY  Imitation  Curse thee for the thought Hast thou in the course of seven enterprizing years ever known me stoop from the originality of  self  to the slavery of another 'Tis true I admire the Lord of CHESTERFIELD his epistles are in the reading hour always in my hand at night they repose behind my pillow and they at present constitute all my travelling library But I scorn to be fettered  either in body or soul The liberty of the  understanding  is as dear to me as the liberty of the  person  and I have too much pride too much dignity to become a plagiary No THORNTON the Earl is as it were my tutor his sentiments are such as I have long felt but such as till now I was cautious of  avowing  Hitherto I have been restrained in my actions and lost half the joy of voluptuousness because forsooth nobody had either reputation or ingenuity enough to keep me in countenance I swam the stream of pleasure but was always afraid of going out of my depth For the herd of men are contented to be libertines in the ordinary shallow way and before the appearance of these  enchanting Letters  we wanted the imprimatur of a man of celebrity to give credit to the efforts of an enterprizing spirit But  now  the impediment is removedthe avenue is  opened and the prospect of pleasure is palpable The repository of STANHOPE the cabinet of CHESTERFIELD the Earl's arcanum are all disclosedEUGENIA bear bear the name ye rosywinged deities of joy in gratitude to heavenEUGENIA has given to mankind the invaluable remains of her father and in that present Oh THORNTON echo EUGENIA hath discovered to every elegant character fresh roads to the temple of felicity and virgin untasted resources of personal extacy  My design then is to indulge my principles by improving upon those maxims which his elegant pen hath made  fashionable  Let others content themselves with the  vulgar  happiness of yielding beauty entrapt simplicity and the mere defloration of female youth  I  cannot be circumscribed by such common  animal  sensations  give me delicacy give me difficulty give me refinementgive me innovationor take from me existence  "To beat the beaten trackto taste the tasted"Oh shockinginsupportable I am above it I scorn it  In a word then THORNTON what our GARRICK is to SHAKESPEARE I am resolved to be to CHESTERFIELDthe living comment upon the dead text The youth to whom the Earl's Letters were originally addressed thou knowest is dead and it should seem that he wanted  soul  to relish them had he continued amongst us Peace to his uncongenial manes I claim the inheritance THORNTON and desire you will consider  me  as his son by the adoption of his  sentiment  Nay had these veins been filled with the rich stream  that fed the heart of STANHOPE I could not have been more like himselfGod forgive me but were it not said that my mother was the Diana of her day I should suspect she played my father the Alderman false and that she threw herself into the conquering and accomplished arms of CHESTERFIELDEarth and skies Mr THORNTON canst thou think I was the product of a plethoric Alderman and that Alderman a dealer in hops Bastardize me dear friend in pity to my feelings and rather than suppose me the offspring of  such  a conjunction make me the byblow of some deity in disguise and let me catch a ray of comfort from illegitimacy  So much for the introduction to our correspondence Of preface no more Prepare for immediate actionA face  passes my window that throws attractions worth pursuing I press the wafer with my seal that I may rise to reconnoitre  Adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER IV  From the Same to the Same  THE Earl's absent man has already exhibited himself He is of the name of HOMESPUN and is the butt of the bath His soul is contemplative and his body pedantic Never saw I so perpendicular or thoughtful a figure a very walking soliloquy and his wife or at least the beautiful She who hangs upon his armO THORNTON THORNTON I have an object before me already young elegant graceful and I warmly hope a  wife  If she should prove indeed the property of this pedantif the stars should have thrown a  hoop of gold  in my way my fortune is madeSoft a little  my landlord entershis eye looks communicationthere is intelligence in every feature I am positive he will prove the  Daily Advertiser  of the bath  Pray MrI forget your name Mr Wyngood is my name Sir Pray Mr Wyngood what fine young lady is that now walking with the straight wellmade gentleman in ravengrey  She is wife to the gentleman Sir and his name is Mr HORACE HOMESPUN a minister come to bathe for the  Dissenters  disorder There's a  vast  deal of company Sir in town and I think you are very lucky in taking my lodgings I have got the best lodgings in all BUXTON and some of the best people in them at this moment Why now Sir you would not think it but I can shew you such things as will surprize youHere  he set off and I followed him into a bedchamber where without any ceremony opening the drawers of his lodgers he took out a ridinghat with a blue feather and a spangled button "Lookee Sir did you ever see the like Then here is silks upon sattins and sattins upon silks and they're the  kindest  people in the world They live as cheap as possible Why I don't suppose one day with another they spend a guinea they pay only eightpence apiece for breakfast a shilling apiece for dinner eightpence for tea in the afternoon a shilling each for supper and fourteen shillings for lodging besides washing coals candles and winesa  mere nothing  as I may say for a wateringplace I presume Sir you would chuse to join them and live in the same manner I see you are a very worthy gentleman and I will go mention you under the name of pray what name must I say Sir  But no matter I will tell Mr HOMESPUN that a new lodger wishes to do as he does Sir your servant I will be with you again presently  The fellow had it all his own way THORNTON I interrupted him not and am this very night to sup with master minister HOMESPUN I have walked down to the well and drank a glass at this Helicon of health I was in this ramble the man of fashion just stept out of the chaise and elegantly disordered in my dressmy hair was tied with negligence my curls loose and in the  ton  of confusion and my frock discovered a genteel shape and the cut of a good taylor A miscellaneous group were passing away the intermediate hours betwixt teatime and supper the lame and the lazy the merry and the mortified were all upon the saunter HOMESPUN was fondly ruminating  with his angelic consort in the shade and  something  that had the appearance of a fopI mean of the common kindwas saying smart things to a pretty wellwoman  Nothing however could induce me to stay a moment at this dull place but the  practice  of  precepts  which will convert all places into a paradise and make even a  wateringplace  deliciousI am summoned by the supperbellMrs HOMESPUNOh what a name for such a creatureis tripping it towards the sound and HOMESPUN himself seems to forget his primitive uprightness of back and steps briskly forward  Farewel PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER V  From the Same to the Same  CHESTERFIELD is right attention annihilates learning and carries away all before it I am in the road to rapture I have time only to give you the  hint  Another opportunity of  being assiduous  offers itself the moment must not be lost  Adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER VI  From the Same to the Same  I IMPROVE every hourOh why did not the Earl sanctify the paths of dissimulation that I might have lived to pleasure many years ago It is now only that I  begin  to live I have had my dear THORNTON in the course of a few hours a conquest superior to ALEXANDER'S I have made an  ordinary  coxcomb  pleased with himself  and yet discarded by his mistress I have seen a learned husband detestible in the eyes of his wife for the  first time  and I find him enraptured with the  very man  by whom he is made ridiculous and all this from the practice of a single precept  Study to please  I will go through every sentiment in the Earl's correspondence before I quit BUXTON all the books in all the languages are barren and deserve to be burnt but the epistles of my STANHOPE But stopI heard Mrs HOMESPUN express her aversion to cheese and though I  like it myself  I must hasten to order it may never appear again to offend her Nothing is immaterial that  pleases  Adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER VII THORNTON  to  SEDLEY  THOU mightst as well send folded to me a sheet of white paper Thou writest much without saying any thing Thy heart is engaged in the ardour of some pursuit and thy pen denotes agitation bustle and contrivance but thou speakest only generally I prithee SEDLEY reduce thy extravagant genius into order and let me understand by the post the meaning of sentiments I perceive not at present the drift of If anything starts that demands assistance or if thou meetest more adventure than thou canst thyself manage tell me so and I will order my horse to the door and go snacks in your enterprizes Farewel  JAMES THORNTON  LETTER VIII  From the Reverend  HORACE HOMESPUN  to Doctor  DIGGORY  Dear Sir  YOU remember I presume the jaunt I took in the last year to SOUTHAMPTON the particulars of which at the request of some friends I suffered to be printed in the WESTMINSTER MAGAZINE in two several letters addressed to the publisher Mr THOMAS WRIGHT of Essexstreet in the Strand London I there told you that I was not quite so highly interested in or entertained by the scenes in a hurry before me as my  then  patron the Baronet would flatter my  imagination with upon the road and as I find those letters from the Westminster Magazine were reprinted into various  other  monthly publications I have reason to suppose my excursion afforded some amusement to a certain set of readers  But having since then been yoked to a damsel who hath a passion for these wateringplaces and who bringing along with her a decent fortune has a right to indulge herself in such amusements as seem best unto her I have a  second  opportunity to survey the customs and manners of waterdrinkers and duckers and can now give you many curious particulars by way of supplement to the accounts I have already published  As my present cure is situated about thirtyseven post miles and a quarter from the waters of BUXTON amidst the wonders  of the Peake Mrs HOMESPUN chose to pass a week at that place for the benefit of a pain in the ancle which became grievous about six minutes before she suggested to me the necessity of such an excursion  That the cure of her ancle might be perfectly completed I contrived it so as to persuade the curate of a neighbouring parish to do duty at home in my absence and resolved to stay a fortnight Of this fortnight only four days are yet expired and though I never underwent the same degree of parade of fatigue and of impertinence in any former fourteen years of my lifenot even when I preached thrice in the Sunday and footed it to two of the curesyet HARRIET seems so happy in  doing as others do  and finds such real felicity in the dullest spot I ever beheld that I am in doubt whether even  the long residue of the fortnight will satisfy her so as to return home to peace privacy and the parsonagehouse without murmurings and repinings  Oh Doctor see the outlines of my situation and pity me I am amongst a number of both sexes whose pleasures are my aversions and whose amusements I cannot relish I love quietness and the shade of life and yet the house where I now lodge is as public as an inn at a fair I admire rural ornaments and scenes of summer verdure beyond imagination and yet the mountains of Arabia Deserta exhibit not a prospect so barren as that by which BUXTON is bounded I love to stroll into the shop of an intelligent bookseller and to converse with him upon the topic of recent publicationsalas the bookseller of BUXTON has nothing in his shop but the trash that circulates at a  wateringplace amongst the women I ran my eye over his catalogue and never did I see such a collection Clelia Pamela the Adventures of Cleopatra Amusements at the German Spa and the History of an Actress were the best in this bad bundle  I mentioned the Reviewsno body called for  them  I talked of the Magazinesnone were ordered I rummaged every row for  philosophy  nobody reads philosophy at a wateringplace I criticised the shelves for  morals  but found them not I ventured to ask but with some little hesitation for Secker's Lecturesthe bookseller never heard of them I took a turn round the shop and having forgot to bring any books with me would have taken up with almost anything  approaching  to the rational but in my progress I had wellnigh overset a glasscase  of toothpicks gold hussives embroidered pincushions and embossed snuffboxes  And now it appeared that this harlequin trader was rather a haberdasher than a bookseller  On casting my eyes towards a person at the other end of the shop I saw her bending wire to form what is facetiously called a cap over this person's head was a goodly show of bandboxes and across the window at which she sat were ribbons variously twisted and several specimens of her skill in decorating that part of the body which is  now  more ridiculous than any other Seeing such preparations for the  outside  of the head I gave up the idea of finding any  internal  furniture and walking out of the shop asked pardon for having so grossly mistaken a milliner's and toyman's for a vender of matters in  the literary wayJust as I got to the door a party of mighty pretty women and my wife amongst the rest for  she  already knew every body came rustling into the shop and in a lisping tone attuned to the articulation of a wateringplace desired the haberdasherymillinery bookseller to look for JULIA MANDEVILLE Julia Mandeville was not to be had Then let us have SIDNEY BIDDULPH said the ladies Sidney Biddulph was out I'm for THE MISTAKES OF THE HEART cried a very gravelooking woman I wish my dear said my wife to me with a very wellbred civility taking less notice of me than usual you had brought JOSEPH ANDREWS along with you Oh la Ma'am replied another how can you possibly read such  low  stuffthe adventures of a footman a kitchin wench and a strolling parsonNay Madam said HARRIET don't say anything against  the parsons pray remember I'm a clergyman's wife and there he standsan ABRAHAM ADAMS every inch of him a'n't you my dear  This was too much I attempted to go but HARRIET caught me by the coat The poor ladies were in great anxiety to find THE MISTAKES OF THE HEART had been carried off last season by a person who took the road to GRETNA GREEN with her footman in her way to London though some said the haberdasher archly may think  that  was going a roundabout way too If we can't get THE MISTAKES suppose rejoined the ladies we make shift till we can have something  better  with TOM JONESAye TOM JONES is tolerable enough said a pale lady if he would but say more about SOPHIA and give us less nonsense about the old vulgar father the  fusty aunt and those unentertaining horrid creatures THWACKUM and SQUARE As to his Introductory Chapters as he calls them I always skip 'em and yet if he was a little plainer in telling us what we were to expect at the top of his chapters I really think it would be a  goodish prettyish  sort of a novel Tom Jones it seems was now in reading by Lady Sallow's coachmanThe haberdasher recommended FILIAL PIETY the ladies were satisfied that it was a dull serious sermonizing thing from the title FILIAL PIETY indeedsend it to Miss Dorothy Desolate who is come to dip for the dismals or Lady Bab Bluebutter who wants to drink away her frogfreckled complexionHa ha ha he he he  The laugh was now more violent than the wit was brilliant by which it was occasioned  and my dear HARRIET joined in it most cordiallyThey were about to depart without any books at all when the haberdasher mentioned some odd volumes of the Spectator They asked what he meant by talking about such old things which they had been  obliged  to read over and over again when they were at their boardingschools Lord cried one of the damsels here's DELICATE EMBARRASSMENTSOh the very thingworth all the Spectators that ever were  wrote  Aye take it and let us go read it directlyIt don't  end well  I think objected another I had rather read EACH SEX IN THEIR HUMOURHere is  Something New  ladies said the haberdasherAs old as the poles said the faironesWhat say you to ELOISAOh by all means Have you got ELOISAreach it this momentOh the dear bookthere are  three  letters in the first volume worth all  the worldCome it's a nasty evening and not fit for walking let us hurry away and so send them Mr TRASHLEY to  the Hall  this instant Come Mr HOMESPUN turning to me you shall  'squire  us  They fluttered out caught me by the arm and carried me off in high triumph ten times faster than I should have walked had I been permitted to do as I thought proper But that is a matter by no means allowable at a wateringplace Even now I am summoned by a messenger who says  the party  are waiting for me to go into the walks I dare not stay to finish my letter lest I should become  ridiculous  so you must wait till I can next steal a moment  from  folly  for  friendship  I am dear Doctor Your most humble servant HORACE HOMESPUN  LETTER IX SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  OH for the genius of old HORATIUS FLACCUS that I might compress a volume of facts within the foldings of a single sheet of paper Hear see be convinced congratulate me and sing a  Te Deum  to thy friend and a requiem to the immortal memory of STANHOPE  The party of which I was made one consisted of master minister HOMESPUN his lady an animal who burlesqued the coxcomb and a fourth who departed before the entrance of supper so that of him I shall say nothing at present HOMESPUN and his wife are opposites  and therefore the better suited to the trial of skill At first I said no more than just to shew my breeding and inclination to be happy in their society I let them shew off  themselves  as much as possible that I might accurately learn their tempers before I ventured to attack them HOMESPUN soon discovered himself to be a grubber in books and his lady a lover of the fashions gay giddy goodnatured unsuspicious and uninformed The coxcomb was of the neutral kind but wished to be flattered for his taste in personal ornaments Never was there a more curious trio The conversation turned at first upon weather then upon books then upon dress and last upon the virtue of the BUXTON waters and I accommodated myself to the several changes with tolerable facility  And first to touch the tender part of  our bookworm I observed that the public sustained a great loss in the death of several ornaments of the age I spoke critically as to the satiric powers of CHARLES CHURCHILL and poetically as to the Pindaric flights of GRAY I entered into the intricacies of the epic and drew the line betwixt the original HOMER and the imitator VIRGIL I spoke of ease in the style of TILLOTSON and of the pathetic in the periods of YORICK I affected even to discountenance the innuendo of TRISTRAM SHANDY and I compared his licentious spirit with the voluptuous OVID I pretended to discover an ostentatious display of talents in the Orations and Epistles of CICERO and I took care to suit every opinion to the taste of the person I addressed who had his share in the conversation too and who as I have since heard mentions me to his friends as a paragon of learning  I must not forget to tell thee that when I was talking upon books and mentioned the ELEMENTS OF CRITICISM Mrs HOMESPUN though no simpleton asked me with great simplicity if that was a  novel  to which the fop answered  Yes  it came out last year and was written by an intimate friend of his but that though  he  pushed it with all his interest it did not  take  and was now totally buried in oblivion  I contradicted this with all possible politeness  I imagined he might be mistaken  that work  I believed  was attributed to LORD KAMESa writer with whom I did  not doubt  but he was acquainted Possibly he might confound the title a little with others similar to it which might very easily be done I had caught  myself  in such errors a thousand times Mr HOMESPUN chuckled at my candour  Mrs HOMESPUN I know by her eyes said something to her husband in a low voice in my favour and the fop himself with a smile of complacence but without any confusion at detected ignorance such THORNTON is the force of  manner  said it was very likely he might be misled by the title that there were three or four  elements  and he was most superlatively obliged to me for setting him right  Upon the topic of dress I took care to agree with Mrs HOMESPUN in every particular except that now and then I affected in a gentle tone of voice and submissive smile of countenance to differ from her on purpose to throw the triumph on  her  side make her happy in an ideal superiority the better to impress her with a proper notion of my good manners in yielding to conviction  The fop hopped out about twelve o'clock and took me by the hand in token of satisfaction Honest HORACE that is his Christian name considers me as his comforter and declares that he hopes for some happiness now even in a wateringplace and Mrs HOMESPUN or as I shall call her hereafter to use as little as possible that vulgar name HARRIET makes no scruple of saying I am the most chatty agreeable man at the bath  I caught her THORNTON twice measuring me from top to bottom and then she gave HORACE a surveyBy the soft halfsuppressed sigh she gave at the end of it it is easy to seewhose dimensions she likes best  Oh THORNTON if I can once bring her to be discontented with her situation  if she once begins to repent of her bargain the day is my own I never saw a pair of eyes more likely to fall in love than hers The eyes of HORACE are grey and without lustre She hath the right lips of invitation the vulgar HORACE smackt them at something she said but methinks the impression was only  skindeep  She is in full health and in the heyday of female youth  Oh THORNTON THORNTON pray earnestly that she may be miserable and that the despair of her heart may be removed only by thy friend  PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER X THORNTON  to  SEDLEY  HORACE HOMESPUN will I perceive have in due time a horn upon his head and yet I feel a pang for the poor pedantHang it SEDLEY why shouldst thou pluck the rose from the matrimonial pillow Why plant a thorn in its steadButbutI beg pardon 'twas a tug of conscience I am ashamed of the sensation I half blush at the impoliteness Go on and prosper I am all expectation till I hear of the downfal of the bewitching HARRIET  Farewel JAMES THORNTON  LETTER XI SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  THE horrors of the gout and the tremblings of the palsy seize thee for throwing a thought across me that hath well nigh torn a leaf of CHESTERFIELD from my heartThe matrimonial roseOh thou barbarian Wouldst thou ruin my principles and have me act in repugnance to my preceptor already Infidel avaunt My creed is established Dare noton thy life THORNTON dare not again attempt to make me an apostate to PLEASURE Halfbred man be silent and attentive I have a scene to paint to thee might thaw the frigid feelings of an Anchorite  About one o'clock in the morning the eyes of HORACE began to twinklewhat was before dull became duller till at last the four eyelashes met together and covered the balls of sight HARRIET continued loquacious and lively and resolved not to go to bed till it was a more  modish  hour insisting that I should keep her company I humoured her vivacity till HORACE began to snore and then shifted the conversation to something less spirited  Sentiment  THORNTON when enforced at a proper crisis is a better weapon for a man of pleasure than downright  licentiousness  I began to sing forth the happiness of Mr HOMESPUN said many things in praise of his learning honesty and hospitable turn of thinkingtold a tale of disappointed passiondescanted on the difficulties often attending reciprocal  attractionsplaced two young people in several affecting situations I altered the tone of my voice and suited it to the stillness of the nightsighed in whisper corrected myselfcalled a tear into my eyeassumed a softened flexibility of featureand now and then took my eye from viewing her as if sensibly struck with my danger  Part of the flowers with which she had been some time playing fell on the floor I took them up with a trembling hand and put them into hers with a pressure scarcely perceptible There was a sudden blush over her face in a moment I took no notice of it but catching up a myrtlesprig kept it sportingly as if to conceal a new sighpresented it to her as the feshest on the table and rose to take my leave  It was the exact moment of departure She was visibly agitated and I would not see it She took the sprig and I saw the leaves shake I went softly to the door left with her the compliments of the night in a gentleness of the tones perfectly patheticlingered at the door a moment complained that I could not open it hastily for fear of disturbing her husbandat last I  almost  shut ithalf opened it again

four this instant stopt at the door of mine host in which were three new visitants The foreglass was let down by a female hand so exquisitely white and so full of promise that I was induced to examine the other parts of the person to which it belonged  THORNTON she is a cherubim a mixture of beauty and breeding  As she stept from the chaise she discovered an ancle formed by Harmony and  polished by the Graces Her shape is admirable I only scribble this to announce her arrival at the bath Thou knowest the rest  Adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER XIII THORNTON  to  SEDLEY  THY letter is just brought me by the postman A cursed circumstance that requires my attendance in town till next Wednesday prevents my present happiness But my horse shall be at the door at Thursday's dawn and I will order relays by which means I shall reach BUXTON at dinner Take care of the Cherubim for thy friend  Farewel JAMES THORNTON  LETTER XIV SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  ORDER not thy horse to be bittedput not thy presumptuous foot in the stirrup Invade not the sacred prospects of a friend's felicity There are only two forms in BUXTON  worth  undoingHARRIET HOMESPUN and the Cherubim Sit quiet and saddle not thy steed if thou wishest the continued affection of thy  PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER XV  Miss  DELIA DELMORE  to Lady  LUCY SAXBY  THE journey has already had a good effect my dear LUCY upon poor FANNY We travelled by easy stages and I hope  much  from the alteration of air even if the waters should want virtue to restore her The poor thing has been to all the baths in the kingdom you know except those of BUXTON Alas I fear her disorder has got too near her heart for medicine and the God that afflicts can only I believe remove the affliction Never was known so gradual a decline and yet no application could stop its progressWhat a pity LUCY  that such a form should be daily decaying before the eyes of the most tender relations Company conversation the simplicity of her diet the wholesomeness of the situation are all that can be expected from a short residence here as the waters of BUXTON are not strongly recommended in consumptive complaints She is always best in society and I am happy to tell you the place is tolerably full Her poor fond husband hangs over her fading form with more tenderness than when it was in its bloom Pray Heaven these assiduities may prove successful I with write again soon  DELIA DELMORE  LETTER XVI  Miss  DELIA DELMORE  in Continuation  SOFTNESS to the sick is better than a cordial FANNY ventured yesterday to breakfast in public her delicate form beautiful in distress instantly attracted and  claimed  what it  received  the attention of the whole company She was dressed with her usual simplicity and suited her ornaments to her situation In my life I never saw any body in the luxuriancy of health half so interesting After the first dish of tea the flush which was formerly a constant resident revisited her cheekthe disorder has not in any degree tinged her complexionher forehead is as it ever was alabaster white and  the veins that meander round the temples are so transparently blue and the circulation seems to be performed so pacifically one might almost envy the delicacy which a cruel disorder hath bestowed upon her In the eyes of several young ladies who by their florid appearance came hither merely for amusement I saw the glistening drop of sympathyand the men who were laughing at our entrance soon softened their voices and spoke almost in a whisper in compliment to the lovely invalid who appeared to  want  such attention  FANNY was sensible to their indulgence and smiled acknowledgment At last in came a stranger elegant and easy beyond description  How  my LUCY shall I proceedFANNY sunk upon my arm complained that she was worse on a sudden and rose to go outthe stranger assisted  with a gentleness not to be described and she tottered down stairs under these supports to her apartment  I am so affected at present that I can write no more  LETTER XVII  Mrs  MORTIMER  to Miss  SIDNEY  HEAVEN scarce allows me strength to tell you that I am come to a place of all others in the habitable world the most miserable to me In a word the only person upon earth that I would have  avoided  is at the bath God protest me what  am  I to do Pity and pray for the dying  FANNY MORTIMER  LETTER XVIII  The Reverend  HORACE HOMESPUN  to Doctor  DIGGORY  Dear Friend  I REALLY begin to think I shall find some satisfaction at BUXTON bath Amidst a cluster of insignificant characters one gentleman has distinguished himself so much above the rest that I have at once gratified my pride and curiosity in his acquaintance  He is intimately acquainted with polite and elegant learning perfectly well mannered and not above conversing upon  subjects of divinity and ethics even at a  wateringplace  My wife says he understands to a nicety what some of the waterers call the ETIQUETTE of dress and with the arts of a scholar he has it seems the invention and taste of a courtier without anything of courtly insincerity  In truth I am apt to think very favourably of him especially as his exterior does not seem more frank and open than his interior is ingenuous and undisguised  One  such character will atone for the stupidity of the  rest  As I am fond of now and then what I call a woodwalk or a ramble by myself I can now take  this  without a breach of good manners for I can leave this accomplished gentleman with HARRIET who is fond enough of his company to accept of him in  my  absence  I am half inclined to forgive wateringplaces which have in the end after much prior disappointment produced so agreeable a companion whose sentiments of life and maxims of  moral  conduct do credit to himself and honour to the species  I am dear Doctor Your faithful servant HORACE HOMESPUN  LETTER XIX  Mrs  HOMESPUN  to Mrs  LA MOTT  OH that I could live at BUXTON for ever We have since I last wrote to you got acquainted with the handsomest man in the world and tho' he is as good a scholar as HORACE yet he understands as well as I do all the prettinesses of  dress  which you know HORACE is entirely ignorant of Then he is so polite so unaffected he contradicts with such gentlenesshe is so open to convictionYou know my aversion to filthy  cheese  I happened only to  hint  this and he ordered it never to be brought again to the table while I was at the bath tho' Mr HOMESPUN said  I ought to suffer what was offensive to  myself  out of goodmanners to the  company  'Tis hardly worth attending to and perhaps you'll laugh at my taking  notice  of such a trifle but he sits in a chair eats his victuals cuts it into slices and holds his knife and fork as different from HORACE as possible who you know sometimes seems so over head and ears in thought that he forgets the dinner is before him picks his teeth and sits silent till the cloth is ready to be taken away Then again as to carving HORACE can no more do the honours of the table than a baby he  misses the joint  and sometimes scatters the sauce in ones face whereas  this  gentleman hits the mark as dexterously as a surgeon helps the ladies to the greatest delicacies with such a gentle manner and with a countenance  so smiling that it is impossible to refuse what he offers  At supper last night HORACE was in one of his thoughtful moods and disgusted me horridly  There was a roasted fowl and HORACE perceiving my plate empty must needs fill it with one of the wings which he made shift to mangle off with the knife with which he had been eating though another for the purpose was lying on the other side the dish Then he must needs make my wing swim with the gravy and in awkwardly tilting the dish several drops flew upon the gentleman's waistcoat Mr SEDLEYthat is his name said it was no matter it was not easy to help such accidents and begged he would consider it as of no sort of consequenceSweet fellowOh that HORACE  would imitate him He is now walking towards our lodgings and HORACE slouching by the side of him HORACE is upright enough but then he looks as stiff and uncomfortable as an overstarched shirtSEDLEY moves as if he was quite happy Mr HOMESPUN struts as if he was in misery They are both at the door  Adieu adieu HARRIET HOMESPUN  LETTER XX SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  THE proverb is verified It cannot rain but it pours The Cherubim I mentioned to thee in my last is a cherub of an inferior order when compared with the SERAPH who came with her She was at  that  time muffled up and close hooded but when on the next day the veil was withdrawn judge of my surprize when I beheld the very  She  the charming  She  whom last season I met with her father Sir HENRY DELMORE at SCARBOROUGH at the very period that the letters of my  divine Earl  became popular and I had brought a copy of them We lodged in the same house  and I became agreeable to Sir HENRY The very first trial I made to reduce my favourite precepts to practice was upon the heart of this very girl then glowing with all the graces of health and endowed with all the enchantments of a  pathetic  temper I soon pretended to lose  my  vivacity and became the softest son of sentiment that ever was born The net of silk which I had diligently woven became successful and I had certainly caught in it the fairest prize in the creation had not a cruel necessity called me from the bath  Several transient teteatetes I Had with her there gave me the opportunities I wished Her passion was imaginary but pleasingshe fixed high the standard of domestic felicity and unreasonably loved to refine  To accommodate myself to  this  was at first not easy but before I quitted SCARBOROUGH I was so distinguished for the  pensenoso  that even Sir HENRY himself began to think I was falling into a hypochondriac disorder and used every effort to divert me  Though I was then but a novice in the theory of joy I had read enough of CHESTERFIELD to know the potency of  dissimulation  and had it been in my power to have staid  another week  should have even  then  added an illustrious example to corroborate that glorious precept which advises "to adapt the character and conversation to the company"  Since these transactions she is altered THORNTONaltered in every part of her situation the is married and in a consumption and yet like certain fruits she  is delicious in decay I was pleased to see her disordered at the first interview the little blood that painted her cheek disappeared her knees shook and her hands trembled at the recollection And this too was in a public breakfastingroom Judge how her agitation must alarm the company and operate amongst the women in my favour Who knows THONRTON but the beautiful invalid may have brought herself to this state upon  my  account If so ought not  I  to pity herand ought not  she  to thank the gods that I again "am come to comfort her" At all events you ought to congratulate me and once again sing  Io Paean  to the canonized bones of CHESTERFIELD  Adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER XXI  From the Same to the Same  THE HOMESPUNS are secured I have them by the  heart  and enjoy in an equal degree the  confidence  of the wife and husband  HORACE has many  oddities  of which hid wife is lately become sensible and it has been  my  business to excuse them to her He is addicted to catch hold of the button and in the ardour of philosophical and systematic conversation tugs at it most immoderately Last night in supporting a favourite opinion which was opposed stoutly by the fopling he seized  the wrought button and tore his fingers against the raisedwork on the surface till the blood fairly gushed out in a stream and spotted his sables The fop sworeI checked him with  temper  the parson cooled in his  argument  and I applied an handkerchief to the wound and thus saved them both from  looking silly  HORACE'S nails are not quite so  accurately clean  as they might be and as I observed Mrs HOMESPUN comparing them with  mine  I suddenly closed my hand as  if  out of tenderness lest the comparison should turn to HORACE'S disadvantage yet this  very  tenderness  so managed  answered the design compleatly and I can see plainly HARRIET thinks hardly of HORACE for neglecting to pick the dirt from under his nails while on  the other hand when he and I are  together  we laugh at the fopperies of the times and seem mutually to despise all its DELICATESSE  Adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER XXI THORTON  to  SEDLEY  CORMORANT in pleasure insatiate conqueror What is not one object sufficient at a time Must thy bow have seven strings to it and Canst thou not be satisfied with the victory thou wilt soon gain over the buxom HARRIET but thou must plot captivity for the Cherubim and hope to carry  all  before thee This is illustrating thy favourite Lord's maxims with a witness And wilt thou not bestow a single beauty to thy friend Be this as it may spareI conjure thee spare the delicate distressedharm not the gentle FANNY but suffer  her  to live  the short remainder of her days in the purity of conjugal caressesspot not the ermine at  expiring chastity  but let her spirit ascend immaculate to heaven  Do this if thou art a  man  The high in  health  may admit and return thy revels but pity the  sick  sister and let not the maxims of thy Preceptor be made subservient to sanctify barbarity If thou triest to ensnare the sinking soul of FANNY MORTIMER thou art a fiend and unworthy the friendship of thy  J THORNTON  P S  Is it not said in the volume of thine Oracle "A man is fit neither for business or pleasure who either does not  or cannot command and direct his attention to the present object and in some degree banish for  that  time all other objects from his thoughts"  How is this admonition consistent with thy scheme of three at a time Study to be consistent or all is over  LETTER XXII SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  THE very worst reasoner in the dominions of GEORGE is JAMES THORNTON Esq  And so because I have an eye upon  three  thou supposest I must needs be inconsistent and irregular Dost thou not know that the same Oracle advises a quickness of attention an unobserved observation the art of seeing all the people in the room without appearing to look  critically  Is there not according to that Oracle pretty nearly the same degree of deception in every character  and are we not to turn all this hypocrisy to  our  advantage even while we  seem  to think every body  honest  The great nicety in my present situation  thou  dost not see nor will  I  be at the pains to develope it to so awkward an arguer  What a conclusion hast thou drawn indeed from my having  three  objects in view not considering that I am as cool and collected as if I had but  one  and that I have a capacity equal to the conquest of thirty times three  Learn to know me better  I am too well disciplined in my system to be precipitate or to hazard the mortification of being disappointed by  rashly seizing that which I perceive can only be attained gradually by the successful efforts of resistless insinuation  The Master of my Art says very truly  Little minds are in a hurry when the object proves too big for them they run they puzzle confound and perplex themselves they want to do every thing at once and never do it at all But a man of sense takes the time for doing the thing he is about well and his haste to dispatch a business only appears by the continuity of his application to it he pursues it with a cool steadiness and finishes it before he begins any other  This last sentence THORNTON thou mayst think clashes with my present attack upon the three beauties of BUXTON  Thou art  again  mistaken  I am not in a hurry to be happy as to the  ultimatum  of female favours Like a man of resolution I can watch the progress of a favourite pursuit and see it prosper under my eye without seizing the final recompence of my labour till it is the proper  crisis  of fruition  To bring these arguments home to the points in question thou must understand that had only HARRIET HOMESPUN been at the bath I should have been contented till  her finishing  but as the Fates have thrown two  sisters  in my way of which one happens to be an old acquaintance but whom accident permitted to slip through my fingers  unconquered  or at least without bestowing upon her victor the  rewards  of conquest I must suit myself to the triple tie that chance hath  laid upon me with as much adroitness as I am able And  this  is the delicacy in my situation to which in the beginning of this letter I alluded  One great part of my system is to make people who are to give  me  happiness happy in themselves I must to this end take care to avoid making any of these dear creatures  rivals  to each otherto  boast  of amours thou knowest is utterly repugnant to the STANHOPEAN principle  Press  for the favour  read  the  eyes fix  the  heart  and revel over the  yielded  person  ad eternitatem  but keep the joy to  thyself  nor ever with rascal loquacity betray the infirmity of her whose indulgence has give thee the first of felicities  To one friend I have  ventured  to disclose myself in the very confidence of my  soul If thou  betrayest  me though but in the hour of ebrietyit does not admit of an  if  thou art a guarded honourable character  No more I prithee as to plurality of objects  The CHESTERFIELD system admits not the fearful and filthy intercourse of  venal  women  He  could not allow the horrid and vulgar hazards of cs and ps "Avoid" saith he in his coelestial chapter on Pleasures  the fate of the  promiscuous  fornicator what a wretch is a rake with half a nose crippled by coarse and infamous debauches  Hence THORNTON it is evident that a man is justified provided he keeps the secret to search the circle of the earth for those favours and elevated connexions  that bring along with them the honey without the sting It is beneath a  gentleman  to beat round the bagnio's or criticise the brothel Leave  such  to the appetites of apprentices whose vulgar palates can digest anything Be it the business of those who are governed by the  laws of goodbreeding  to enlist themselves under the  white banner of apparent modesty  and invite embraces unallayed by terrors and suspicions  The constitution of a man of fashion demands in these cases the utmost circumspection the  wife  the  virgin  and the FRIEND only promise this  blissful security  To them then let us direct ourselves in selfdefence and thus procure the personal paradise in which the roses of beauty bloom without a  thorn  I have said thus much to silence thee once for all as to the nature of my favourite principle which thou now perceivest to be not more pleasing than  rational  No more then of thy whining passages about pity and virtue and all the etcaetera of  parsonly  cant  The man of taste and fashion moves above it  Adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER XXIII  The Reverend  HORACE HOMESPUN  to Doctor  DIGGORY  Dear Doctor  WE are all wrong again  The head of poor HARRIET is certainly turned and instead of a cure being performed she is certainly distracted by these same waters of BUXTON This day we drank tea in private and never heard I such a train of conversation as she fell into Why Doctor she is  gone  her intellects I meanpast redemption  For the first time in her life she found fault with everything I did She insisted upon it I drank my tea  too hot  which was not only she said injurious to the coat of the stomach but shockingly  indelicate  The teaspoon was not managed to her satisfaction I sipped too  loud  from the  saucer  when it would I find have been  genteeler  to apply a  silent  lip to the  cup  Nay what is worse than all this I had the misfortune to fold the bread and butter  ineligantly  and it would have been better there too if I had put the  ends  rather than die  side  of it to my mouth first  But that which most astonished me was her objection to the good old custom of  turning down  my cup which she said was out of the TON and that it would  give her great pleasure if in future I would lay the  spoon across  the cup  I was perfectly petrified and yet  held my tongue and spake nothing  She proposed walking and as I really thought the air might do the poor creature's head good I drew on my gloves and attended her towards the wellwalkAlas Doctor nothing I fear can bring her about for she grew ten times worse than ever and if I was astonished before I was now almost struck dead with the hugeness of my amazement  I had not the happiness to hit her fancy even in my walk which she very fairly told me was  ridiculous  and that I held up my head too high turned  in  my toes too much and wanted the  Graces  in my arms  She actually made an objection to the  manner  in which my wig was powdered said it was all in patches and had not the regular sprinkling of a man of fashion  Upon this I ventured gently to tell her that I was but a country curate that I had no pretensions to  fashion  that I had for my own part nothing to do at wateringplace but to oblige her that I was very sorry for the loftiness of my head which for the time to come should be carried with more humility that if it would give her any pleasure I would take care to stoop till I bent neck and shoulders togetherthat as to inversion of the toes I would learn to dance late in the day as it was for me and inconsistent as such a part might be thought to the clerical character in regard to my arms that I had hitherto only  used them in the ordinary offices of life and found they performed very well for a plain man but that if she had any favourite attitudes or wished me to exhibit in any postures to which she was particularly partial I would practise vigilantly at the lookingglass and rather than want the  Graces  she spoke of would absolutely learn the exercise and go through all the forms and ceremonies of legs arms head and hands like a young recruit At the same time I begged her to consider that as we had since the day of our union lived harmoniously I warmly hoped we should not be put out of tune by trifles which are in themselves insignificant even if we admitted them to be essential to the  etiquette  of a wateringplace I moreover told her to remember that I was at least a  faithful  husband and made her happiness the study practice and contrivance of my  whole life and that surely where the cardinal duties were observed it mattered little whether the toes were the breadth of a barleycorn too much in or out or the head half an inch too lofty or half an inch too low I would have proceeded in my defence but that my good friend Mr SEDLEY at that instant came to my relief told us  as he advanced with warmth vivacity and a chearful countenance that  if we did justice to his attachment to us we might judge of the joy be felt in seeing us so frequently chuse a private path which was to him a certain indication of matrimonial felicity  There was something so pretty in his speech that it made an impression on my memory and I have copied it  verbatim  In less than half an hour Mrs HOMESPUN recovered her reason her  late lunacy was never hinted at and hoping to continue her goodnature I invited this most agreeable gentleman to take another bit of supper with us  The manner in which he accepted the invitation trebled the sense of the favour he did me by his company What a gratification it is to have so sensible and entertaining a friend at a wateringplace  Dear Doctor  I am yours truly HORACE HOMESPUN  LETTER XXIV SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  A MAN THORTON who is  true  to the relish of pleasure can extract extacy even from disappointment The  bliss of blisses  alone could have made me happier than I was an hour ago  Hear the story  Since the first moment I cast my eye upon the bewitching HARRIET I marked her for my own and  she  hath since been the  grand  point of all my insinuation and ingenuity Not a single article hath been neglected that could touch her imagination move her heart and catch her  favourite  weaknesses  I paid court to her fancy to her feelings to her foibles Constant attention hath done the business I expected it would and I have but one effort more to be master of  all  that the sinest woman in the world has to bestow  Last night my THORNTON was the conscious period that yielded up every transport but  the one  HORACE was requested to perform the funeralservice over the corpse of a fellow who died by a dropsy as the parson of the parish was indisposed and it seems he was to be buried at a town a mile distant from our lodgings  He wentThe opportunity was not to be omitted I exerted myself I sparkled in the lustre of STANHOPEAN sentimentsI became eloquent and soon communicated a part of  my  ardour to the  troubled bosom of HARRIET I hit her soft upon the heart Our eyes met  they  confirmed our  sentiments  our voices grew soft as the summerbreezesthere was no intruderI laid my cheek close to hersthey were both upon the glow for the first time in my life I kissed her lipsI repeated the pressureshe repulsed meI dropped upon my knee and in that attitude repeated the offence Nature was stirred to the uttermost I continued to suck the delicious poison and unawares she returned the salutation The dalliance was no longer to be borne she begged me for God's sake to desist The flush of desire and modesty were at war in her cheekher bosom palpitated I plied her with my precious maxims in a whisper that gave them additional gracesI laid my hand upon her heart the throb was violent and as I caught her eagerly in my arms her head sunk  in unresisting softness on my shoulder and worked to the extreme betwixt sentiment and sensation she burst into tears  I composed her cheekdrew her handkerchief gently over her eye fixed her again without offering to distress her in her chair and to this moment she thinks I sacrificed to love respect delicacy and friendship a passion that is tearing me to pieces  In a few minutes HOMESPUN returned he is no reader of looks and I took my leave for the night with that  easy intrepid assurance  which belongs to the great character I have adopted  And now THORNTON am I not a tolerable proficient in the science of dissimulation Does anything come amiss to me Can I not  assume with ease and  wear with chearfulness every shape  Are not heat cold luxury abstinence gravity gaiety ceremony easiness learning trifling business and pleasure modes which according to my Preceptor's advice I am able to take lay aside or change occasionally with as much ease as I would take and lay aside my hat But you may expect nobler illustrations of this hereafter I am yet in the outset of my adventuressporting by way of trial with jejune experiments The next time I can send THEE out of the way HORACE HOMESPUN beware Thou hast just escaped a sore evil A little while ago thou wert within an inch of cuckoldom  THORNTON adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER XXV  The Reverend  HORACE HOMESPUN  to Doctor  DIGGORY  Dear Doctor  SUCH a night as the last I never passed My poor wife has had a relapse Doctor It returned at midnight upon her and raged with the most frightful violence for above two hours She is absolutely delirious and I am the most wretched of men  About an hour after we were in bed she complained that there was no bearing  the heat though in truth this is one of the coldest places in England and it had rained all the preceding evening I felt her pulse and it was immoderately full tumultuous and rapid I kissed her with all the tenderness of a sympathizing husbandshe asked me how I could possibly be  so cruel  I offered to lay her dear head upon my bosom as upon the pillow of affection judging that she would be pleased with my assiduities Her eyes were streaming in tearsher face was on firethe sighs came from her palpably against her consent I pressed to know the cause of this at least to what she attributed it and offered to throw on my cloaths and procure a Doctor Her cure she told me was out of the reach of a Doctor but that if I would not suffer her to be quiet without fretting her by my officiousness  she should be under the necessity of getting out of the bed and sit till the morning in a chair A little time after this she changed her manner and with a kinder tone of the voice asked me if I would consent to return home as soon as it was light She caught my hand begged my pardon wetted it with her tears and begged I would excuse her infirmity I drew her fond and close to my heart and I felt  hers  at that moment leap with agony In the next moment she requested me to leave her covered herself hastily head over ears with the bedcloaths and saying that she wished I was wrapping her in the shroud sunk sobbing upon her pillow Oh Doctor what shall I do What can be the matter I am really unconscious of offence She is now in bedperhaps sleep may alleviate her disorder The  worst of it is she will not allow me to speak to any third person and as I myself know nothing of either maladies or their proper medicines I am dreadfully alarmed and tremble for the consequence  Dear Doctor  I am your unhappy friend HORACE HOMESPUN  LETTER XXVI  From the Same to the Same  Dear Doctor  CERTAINLY Mr SEDLEY is the best young man in England When he came to pay me the compliments of the morning he found me in a very dejected situation and though he was far from inquisitive yet I could not conceal from his asking eye the nature of my calamity Poor young Gentleman it was evident that he  felt  for me his countenance lost in a moment all that fine glow that is natural to it and if  my fancy does not deceive me he had some difficulty to prevent a tear from starting He assured me that words were never made to do justice to the feelings of wounded friendship that he was more interested in everything that concerned me and my wife than he could express and that if I would suggest some little pretence either of business or of invitation to leave him with Mrs HOMESPUN in the evening he would certainly either comfort her by every ministration of the sincerest friendship or at worst he would find out the reasons for her anxiety and the nature of her complaint after which he very well observed the remedy would be easy At this generous proposal in which his worthy disposition was manifest I was ready to weep and as we embraced each other at parting our  voices became of no use to us and we could only shew by our sympathising enfoldings that we had a sincere and christian regard for each other  I am Dear Doctor Your most faithful servant HORACE HOMESPUN  LETTER XXVII  Mrs  HOMESPUN  to Mrs  LA MOTTE  OH CHARLOTTE CHARLOTTE what a perplexity am I thrown into by this scheme of pleasure Accursed be the hour in which I set my foot upon the confines of BUXTON Unconscious of any violent partialities I was contented while I was ignorant In the dreary village where our parsonage is a  palace  I was sufficiently happy because I saw nobody superior to Mr HOMESPUN I was the Minister's lady and the wives and daughters of the neighbourhood paid me the compliment of their best curtsey My HORACE really looked handsome in  his Sunday canonicals and I viewed him in the pulpit with pleasure  But alas my CHARLOTTE the scene is changed I have been several days in a place of politeness where HORACE is the most awkward of the circle My eyes are now opened to his imperfections I  see  them I  feel  them I  detest  them He is a lump of learning without ductility without softness withoutwhat Mr SEDLEY calls  the Graces  I am sometimes obliged to ask several times before I can obtain an answer to the most ordinary question and then at last he bursts from his reverie and pretends not to have heard me speak to him Can anything be so disgusting His conversation is unlike that of the rest of the company and instead of bearing a part in little social and endearing  chitchat  he talks eternally about Locke and  Livy and Cicero the Elements of Criticism the Problems of Euclid and such fellowsand many a time when I have wanted him to put a pin in my handkerchief or such little offices of endearment he has been wrapt up in meditation and then stared me full in the face without knowing I was in the room  Then he actually has a strange shy method of treating me as a wife There is no delicacy in his air when he takes my hand he shakes it indeed HEARTILY but then he has the fat fist of a grasier even though in other respects he is disagreeably thin He kisses with a ceremony perfectly classical as Mr SEDLEY calls it There is a pretty method methinks even in the management of the lips By  accident  Mr SEDLEY stole a kiss the other day and he placed it so directly so gently and so pathetically in  the  center  that I never felt such a sensation I protest CHARLOTTE it ran thrilling through every vein of me warmed my very heart and almost took away my breath  We were I remember playing at questions and commands the day being showery so that we could not stir out The forfeit came round at last to HORACE and he smackt me as usual in his roundabout manner Heaven pardon me CHARLOTTE but I was obliged to draw my pockethandkerchief across my mouth and had some difficulty to avoid making a wry face If you was once in the company of Mr SEDLEY he is called the  handsome  SEDLEY here you would never forgetgentle graceful elegant soft genteel and eloquent HeighoWhy CHARLOTTE why did I marry before I had seen  something of the world Or rather Why after I  was  married why did I ever stray from carts and cottages to the delightful dangers of a wateringplace But I must hide my letter Mr HOMESPUN is coming towards the house as erect as a walkingstick  Adieu HARRIET HOMESPUN  LETTER XXVIII  Miss  DELIA DELMORE  to Lady  LUCY SAXBY  FANNY is much disordered my dear LUCY the fainting with which she was seized at the breakfastrooms has preyed on her ever since Her spirits are greatly agitated Her husband attends her with the diligence of a nurse and cannot be persuaded to leave her chamber The poor girl often drops the tear of gratitude but speaks less than usual as she says talking exhausts her She has twice hinted her wishes to be removed from hence either to my father's or to SCARBOROUGH as we thought proper and begs her removal may be pretty late at night for company  she says rather disturbs her since her last accident Poor MORTIMER her husband sees her dying by inches before his face and his unavailing officiousness appears now and then to go too near the heart of the sinking FANNY She is too indisposed to remove at present for my part I have not been able to set my foot yet in the street I love my sister too tenderly to leave her with a strange woman in a strange place especially with one who is merely paid for her attention and who consequently can have none of those charming thoughts that enter into the heart of a tender relation Sometimes my dear the changing a posture sometimes the shifting a pillow or fixing a chair does more by the  method  of doing it than all the elaborate efforts of an avowed nurse A Mr SEDLEYwho is said to be the beauty of the Bath and was the person that handed FANNY down  stairs and was very obliging during her illnesssends every day very respectfully to know how the sick lady improves in her health As many of both sexes were witness to poor FANNY'S distress and as people  should  have a fellowfeeling in places of general resort for cures as well as fashions I wonder  others  have not paid this sweet girl the same compliment  The  manner  in which this gentleman makes the enquiry is pretty he does not presume upon the privilege of a public place and send a blundering footboy with a message nor does he come intruding  himself  but he usually writes a little billet every day varied and containing a new turn in which his expressions discover at once accomplishment and highbreeding and what puts it out of any body's power to misconstrue it  into design he always addresses his cards to MR MORTIMER As my brother was reading one of these this morning to his wife she desired to look at the hand but had scarce held it to her eye before she dropt the paper and letting her arm fall languidly on the pillow said very softly that she could not manage it and was weaker than she imagined  She is now in a gentle dose and I took the opportunity it gave to inform my dear Lucy of our present melancholy situation Sir HARRY and my mother are expected hourly If FANNY really dies my mother will certainly go distracted Heaven bless you and yours  DELIA DELMORE  LETTER XXIX  Mrs  LA MOTTE  to Mrs  HOMESPUN  IN the name of heaven HARRIET what are you about Your letters alarm me beyond imagination You are in the road to ruin I see you upon the very verge of perpetual infamy You can now mark the little imperfections of a husband you are blind to his many virtues You have cast your eye on a man whose person and manners you like better with  this  man you have been already left  alone  you  may  be left alone  again  The next step is too apparent to be mentioned you are very gay very young very inexperienced there is but one way left to prevent your destruction  and  that  is to return home directly and make any excuse to HORACE for the abruptness of your departure I know nothing of the SEDLEY you speak nor do I wish to know him Better had it been on all hands if  you  were as ignorant of him as I am It is plain he hath pleased you  too well  since the pleasure is bought at the dear price of hatred to the best of husbands Yes HARRIET your HORACE is the best of husbands He is an  honest  man if he is not a  brilliant  man and if he does not shine in society he hath an excellent heart and a simplicity of manners truly amiable The little points of objection you have made are when weighed against his various virtues light and of no account while on the other hand SEDLEY has very probably nothing but an  elegance in trifling  to set him of  Waving however these points my dear let us come to others more startling You are a wife you are pregnant you are advanced far in that pregnancy you have a clear character you have the love of an innocent neighbourhoodAwayaway Order your chaise this instant to the door The matter does not admit of a moment's debate I hasten to seal up my letter and I beg for God's sake for your own sake and for that of all that  love you  or that  you love  that you will deliver your answer by word of mouth  I shall catch you to my breast as a dear friend just escaped from a precipiceas a treasure I have luckily rescued in the minute of despair from the surrounding flames Adieu Adieu I enjoin you to be expeditious  CHARLOTTE LA MOTTE  LETTER XXX  Mrs  HOMESPUN  to Mrs  LA MOTTE  Before the receipt of the above  YOUR HARRIET is something happier than when she last sat down to address you Mr SEDLEY has pleaded the cause of poor HORACE so persuasively and  that  behind his back there's a generous man for you that I have been induced to ask his pardon and I am resolved to treat him with more politeness which I find is indispensible in the conduct of a married woman to her husband even though he were indifferent to her  We have past together a very happy  afternoon and though I do not find any greater degree of tenderness for HORACE yet as I know how to make him happy by merely suppressing those sentiments in his disfavour which can do  me no service  to discover I feel the sweets of  disguiseing the truth  upon some occasions I have restored HORACE to perfect serenity and I as sincerely thank Mr SEDLEY for taking me to task Adieu  I am Dear CHARLOTTE Your Affectionate HARRIET HOMESPUN  LETTER XXXI SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  THE first blow is not yet finally given Opportunity hath not favoured temptation  sufficiently  My system not only demands that I should preserve the fact  private  but the reputation of both the man and the woman  unsuspected  I am not to be a harumscarum rake who brutishly and boyishly boasts of his successes but a man of pleasure who is to bathe his senses in bliss and revel in the richest luxuries of enjoyment  privately  with consenting elegance while  in public  I am to sustain a fair character and  pass upon men  who only look  upon the surface as a pattern of purity and a model for morals  HARRIET is a bewitching illiterate sweet piece of unpractised Nature Her complexion is ardent and I have sufficiently set  her  passions afloat but I must take care to guard against working up  my own  All the power of allconquering dissimulation is over when DESIRE seizes the helm from the hand of cool and deliberate REASON  "Vigour and spirit"  are mere madnesses without  "versatility  "and  complacence"  Upon this principle I must walk without deviation like a faithful pupil in the path that is chalkt out for me It is my business to  lead right reason in the triumphant fetters and shackles of the heart and the passions  In order to accomplish this THORNTON I must keep  myself  collected and never strike till I have fully thrown every body  about me off  their  guard and till I can then gratify conquer triumph and enjoy in full security My blood THORNTON is as cool as a turtle's HARRIET'S I see is upon the boil yet she  has  beauty enough to stir me and when the  secure  moment offers itself fear not her disappointment Her wishesshall not be vain  Adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER XXXII SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  I HAVE appeared in public I dined this day at the ordinary  Ordinary  indeed such a room full of emptiness I never beheld citizens apeing the men of mode women of sallow countenances and fops who would be thought witty and elegant when they are merely saucy and affected and dull Alas THORNTON what a pity what a mortification I have not a single competitorI mean not in point of gallantry for that militates against my system of pleasure but there is no one of  my  sex from whom I can gain any real honour in the comparison However as even blockheads are  worth gaining and their hearts worth misleading as they have all foibles to flatter and weaknesses that may be for our interest to work upon I began to shew off and brought the whole company over as my admirers I practised all the charming conversationrules of DORMER with as much facility as if I had been the author of them and indeed they are so suited to my own natural sentiments that I only consider him as having  written  what I long ago  thought  and what I will henceforward invariably practise till I am incapable of farther enjoyment I had the happiness to sit parallel to the very fop already recorded in my correspondence and he was  overdressed  to all the extravagancy of the  ton  while I had the advantage of not in any sort invading the modesty of Nature The fool lookt as if he piqued himself upon his gaudiness he stroaked his ruffles displayed  the baubles of his watch perkt up his head to gaze in the pierglasses pulled his watch in and out of his fob several times eyed himself ascance and figitted up and down in his chair with all the insignificant whiffling agility of the monkey in the fable who had seen the world  Close to the side of this popinjay sat an unweildy animal who to the manners of a bear united the uncouthness of an elephant without half its sagacity and who in feeding scattered his offals around to the utter dismay of the coxcomb who fearful of complaining and alarmed at the size of the antagonist took shelter at a small table or rather sideboard and fluttered himself clean while the monster enjoyed his embarrassment I am happy to tell you that though this piece of pleasantry set the unpolished table in a roar I commanded my features  and did not give way to ridicule Hitherto I have  never laught out  since I came to BUXTON and I solemnly hope I shall never be boorish of boisterous enough to laugh  out  again while I have being  I eat elegantly drank discreetly I  smiled  at a thousand  dull  stories and only told  one  myself and that inconceivably apropos I heard long talkers without appearing to be tired and I looked every person whom I addressed full in the face I dressed my countenance in softness and gave the  douçeur  to all my motions I interrupted no man contradicted cautiously palliated tenderly decided a dispute betwixt the fop and the glutton with a goodhumoured pleasantry caught the habits of the company swore not at all and adapted my conversation to every speaker The consequence  was THORNTON that I was immediately known to be  somebody  nay I was the admiration of  every body  my company was cherished my absence regretted and at my going out of the room a buz of universal approbation followed me down stairs In a word THORNTON the fops were annihilated the prattlers were silenced and I went off in the compleatest triumph of uncontested excellence  And thus having settled my reputation and established myself PUBLICLY it only remains that I enjoy my popularity by  appearing  to deserve it and then I may bid defiance to censure and then WELCOME VOLUPTUOUSNESS  Adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER XXXIII THOMAS  at the Bath to  TIMOTHY  in Town  Buxton  RECEIVE TIMOTHY the greeting of THOMAS  I and my master arrived on the day we set out at this execrable place where I have as yet done little more than stick a pin in SEDLEY'S hair and peruse a page of his CHESTERFIELD after dinner  These books we are both excessively fond of and as he always leaves them in the chamberwindow I take them  up  when he lays them  down  to walk out by which means we make pretty nearly  the same progress If any thing I believe I am half a volume beforehand with him and in the opinion of the judicious am the finer gentleman of the two  Not that my master like your common coxcombs ever mentions his amours or his studies to his servant any more than I discover mine to him we are both better bred but I have heard too much of CHESTERFIELD at table at tea and every where else not to have had long ago a relish for his writings and I scruple not to tell thee TIMOTHY that I have formed myself what you know me to be entirely on his Lordship's model  He had beyond comparison the prettiest pen at an epistle in Europe and is at once so neat and plain that it is  impossible to misunderstand him I once was as vulgar a dog in my choice of books as any in the kingdomI had no more taste TIMOTHY than a teacher of the table of multiplication I thought the luscious lovescenes of ROCHESTER delicious and had a mighty hankering after the memoirs of CLELAND but heaven defend me from such barefaced trash The bawdry brutes  They shew too much to raise desire  No TIM Stanhope has brought me round he teaches that  the very shoe has power to wound  and I am by God's grace and his Lordship's graces as gracefully graceless a rascal and as pretty a fellow as any in Britain  I expect by the Earl's assistance to do an infinite deal of mischief at this wateringplacemy eye though no  settler has pointed at a bathmaid who attracted me in the handing a tumbler of Spawater Nauseous as all minerals are I took it and tost it off because I find to refuse is  ungenteel  I shall subdue this damsel at my leisure having for my more serious  simulations  as his Lordship calls them a noble object in view of whom you will hear more explicitly in my next  SEDLEY is upon some project but I scorn to be guilty of impertinent curiosity and he is as much above making either a confident or a pimp of his servant I should with more propriety have said his  gentleman  as his gentleman is of wearing a livery of worsted lace God and the Graces speed him say I in all his undertakings Every man has a right in this world to follow  the bent of his fancy to  strew the way over with flowers  as the song says and to be as happy both up and  abed  as he possibly can  Vale  as I see your scholars conclude  ValeAdioAdieu  THOMAS  LETTER XXXIV  Mrs  HOMESPUN  to Mrs  LA MOTTE  After receiving Mrs  LA MOTTE  'S Letter  YOUR letter came too late The hour of circumspection is past and I am in utter despair  HARRIET HOMESPUN  LETTER XXXV SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  ADD to the list of my conquests or rather place at the  top  of the CHESTERFIELD catalogue the ruin of HARRIET HOMESPUN Ruin THORNTON why ruin In  my  system the name should be softened The same of the  she  who grants the favour is pure and inviolate as ever Where then the ruin HORACE will sleep as sound this night as the last  He finds not SEDLEY'S kisses on her lips  He saw not thinks it not  He that is robbed not wanting what is stolen  Let him not know'r and he's not robb'd at all  Well said WILL SHAKESPEARE By the same rule master minister HOMESPUN thou being ignorant art not robbed at all However robbed or not robbed I must pay another visit or two to thy treasure before I take my leave of it for ever for thy HARRIET is a most voluptuous banquet and increases the appetite while she indulges itBy the next post THORNTON I shall dispatch another letter mean time I am  Thine PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER XXXVI  Mrs  LA MOTTE  to Mrs  HOMESPUN  AND so the dreadful prophecy in my last is fulfilled As an  unhappy  woman I pity you as an  unchaste  one I can only keep your secret pray for your repentance and take my  everlasting leave  of you  Farewel C LA MOTTE  LETTER XXXVII  Mrs  HOMESPUN  to Mrs  LA MOTTE  PUNCTILIOUS prudish CHARLOTTE that mistakest a slip of the heart for an error in principle Two days ago  I  entertained sentiments like  yours  Novels and vulgar notions ruin half our sex I have begun and am still privately engaged in reading a BOOK that sets all to rights in my own heart and reconciles my conduct to my own conscience As to matrimonial shackles I say with ELOISA  Curse on all laws but those which Love hath made  Had I read the dear BOOK now in my box under lock and key a few months ago take my word for it CHARLOTTE I had never  been a HOMESPUN and would have died rather than have given my hand to a looby of a bookworm unacquainted with the  Beau Monde  and unfavoured by the  Graces  My mind is perfectly at rest and the only mad thing that flies in my face is having thrown away my charms upon a country curate that does not know how to behave in companywho is unable to carve a chicken or lead his wife into a ballroom without hanging down his head and biting his nails  I am H HOMESPUN  LETTER XXXVIII  Mrs  LA MOTTE  to Mrs  HOMESPUN  UPON my wordOh brave Why you have made a rapid progress and are an apt scholar that's certain A young creature scarce twoandtwenty bred upon a barren mountain little read in the ways of any part of the world but the ways of a circumscribed village a farmer to your father and an honest wholesome dairywoman for your mother a little modicum of money to the tune of five hundred pounds the savings of twenty painstaking years of your poor grandamand andto turn  fine lady  all of a suddento trip to BUXTON bath in the height of the season forget all  your country friends and country  feelings  all in a  week  a  little  week Upon my honour you are no common character and I congratulate you on reconciling all this and all that has resulted from this to your capacious conscience Down to the very earth I drop my curtesey fashionable Mrs HOMESPUN  But gracious God can it be possible Is not the last letter marked with your name a forgery Can the character be Mrs HOMESPUN'S Can it be written by  her  whom I have so often distinguished for innocence in the midst of gaiety and modesty in the very bosom of amusement  Is it practicable in so short a space of time to lose all that's valuable all that's feminine all that's truly endearing and to substitute the most despicable  detested contraries Ah HARRIET HARRIET how art thou fallen Thoughtless ingrateful creature Poor HORACE what is become of him If he is yet in ignorance in mercy to his merit  keep  him so at least have the generosity the  humanity  to keep from his knowledge  that  which would cut his honest heart to atoms  But what is the BOOK you allude to as the panacea of a person polluted and a heart set against the venerable maxims of morality Alas Madam be not every way deluded nor books nor tongues nor casuistry nor all the chicane of eloquence misapplied can possibly overturn the sober single system of unentangled innocency I  yet  hope you are not in that wretched state which despairing of forgiveness hunts about for apology nor rather than seem  destitute  condescend to take up with one that in effect plunges you deeper in criminality A drowning creature catches at the slightest twig and a guilty woman is fain to support herself from falling in her own esteem against a tottering pillar  BOOKS HARRIETfind a refuge from the keenness of your own reflections in BOOKS Perish the volume and may the name of its author descend ignominiously to posterity in which the error that you have under your pathetic circumstances been guilty of is not  palpably discountenanced  Mention however the name of that book from which you receive comfort and woman as I am I will undertake to baffle its boasted system and shew that the only way to genuine pleasure is through the paths of purity integrity  and singleness I am and have continued a widow five years upon principle the man I have lost was even less splendid than Mr HOMESPUN nor had his person any peculiar attractions What of that He was good he was great and he was tender as Heaven I wanted not temptation while he was living to indulge indelicacies but I valued both his honour and my own and though I pretend to no gifts of preternatural continency I defy either  books  or  men  to make me act in diametrical opposition to commonsense and christianity  But just at the present crisis you are of all women in the world the most inexcuseable Oh heavens HARRIET reflect a moment More than three parts gone with child  that  child your firstbornthe father an honour to his professionhis profession the  Church    I will say no more for if you had  my  heart enough has been said already to move you to add to your present errors the crime of suicide  Adieu C LA MOTTE  LETTER XXXIX SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  ALL goes on to the utmost content of my heart Oh THORNTON STANHOPE is infallible His maxims are perfect anodynes against disappointment and I shall I do really think render him more celebrated than ever by practically illustrating every precept in every periodI have played the second part of the same tune with HARRIET and I half believe I shall make her a proselyte for she hath got  volume the first  and I have taken care to pencil the places at which I would have her stop a mark in the margin always attracts HORACE and I too are hand and glove and a very  worthy priest he is for an HOMESPUN I'll assure thee  I will give thee however an instance or two of my proficiency in the arts of pleasing When all was over I paid my respects to HARRIET and her Lord at the accustomed hour without the least visible embarrassment or alteration of countenance The poor woman indeed made but a bungling piece of work of it blushed stammered and stopt short while I took care to preserve every muscle and lineament steady and unmoved I see the efficacy of this most materially for had I not practised this presence of mind I do verily believe even the unsagacious HOMESPUN would have suspected what had happened I took him by the hand with the usual cordiality and we walkt to FAIRFIELD a neighbouring village whither by the by he  was walking while the deed was doing like inseparable friends So that there is as thou perceivest fresh reason for thy congratulation  But I have other business in hand and must leave thee THORNTON  Adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER XL THOMAS  at the Bath to  TIMOTHY  in Town  CURSE upon it TIMOTHY SEDLEY hath caught me in the fact the very fact of consulting his oracle He came home accidentally when I thought him safe for at least an hour and I was just enjoying the sweet sentiment and had delv'd into the pith and marrow of the dear Earl's epistle upon dress when this indiscreet master of mine absolutely forgetting his goodbreeding kicked me on the breech took the book out of my hand and led me down stairs by the nose for which if I forgive him  May the shame I mean to brand his name with  Stick on mine  No matter I know my cue  smile at present and strike hereafter  Since this affair the cruel youth keeps the Earl all to himself but I see by the newspapers which come down here his Lordship's  good things  are all collected together in a little snug volume that a man upon any exigences may pop either into his pocket his bosom his breeches or elsewhere as occasion requires This little  essence of the Earl  I desire you will procure me TIMOTHY forthwith and send it down by the Fly I shall not rest till I get it for I comprehend every syllable he says and I have as great a right to do roguish things with a  good grace  as my master So no more at present from thy friend  THOMAS  Postscript  The book will be bought under the title of  Lord CHESTERFIELD'S Advice to his Son  printed as the papers say for RICHARDSON and URQUHART under the Royal Exchange  LETTER XLI SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  I BLUSH as I put my hand to the paper I feel the severity of selfreproach I have deviated from the maxims of my Preceptor by making a man  feel his inferiority  In a word THORNTON I have struck my servant I caught the fellow reading in the sacred page of  my  religion even in the page of the divine DORMER never meant to be polluted by the eye of a footman and I condescended to give him a blow  This  is amongst the list of unpardonable crimes and I must make it up with the lad before I sleep or I shall scorn myself  too heartily A man of fashion use his  fist  and against his footmanSHAME SHAMESHAMEI have a thought to bring all even again  Adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER XLII SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  I COULD singI could dance for alienation is no more THORNTON I have atoned for my meanness ask me now what I have given what I have said what I have done Whatever it was be assured there was  manner  in it and  manner is every thing every where and to every body  Farewel PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER XLIII  The Reverend  HORACE HOMESPUN  to Doctor  DIGGORY  Dear Doctor  THINGS are so pleasingly altered that I have been overruled as to my design of going away even at the end of the fortnight and I have contrived to procure another week's recess in order to extend my HARRIET'S happiness and enjoy myself the spirited yet moral and engaging conduct of Mr SEDLEY who every day becomes more agreeable and who I do truly believe has been not a little instrumental in  bringing about my poor wife to a proper sense of her duty and right reason If anything she is more cordial to me than before my departure from the curacy and is at once lively and obliging  I take it for granted the strange conduct I transmitted you an account of in my late letters was only a transient giddiness not very infrequent as I have observed Doctor to the fair sex about HARRIET'S age which is very well called in one of SHAKESPEARE'S tragedies that I read formerly the  heyday of youthful blood  We grave folks you know my dear DIGGORY ought to allow for all this Poor thing I pity her and am half angry with myself that I should have treated the overflowing effervescent emanations as I may stile them of a juvenile mind as a serious delirium  But thank God it is not gone abroad to any person who is capable of circulating the whisper of the day to the detriment of a fellowcreature Mr SEDLEY who I can easily see is to be trusted with every thing and my old friend and brothercollegian Doctor DIGGORY are the only persons informed of the matter and so all is well But do not I charge you think too hardly of her for what hath been said It was all a misrepresentation and you should admire your heavenly HARRIET as you used to call her the  more  for having been  injured  I can assure you I am at present more satisfied with  her  than I am with  myself  and indeed she has the advantage of me for she appears in the light of a person  calumniated  and I am only one in a state of conscious error and  probation  However a short time will I do not doubt set us all as happy again as our hearts can wishBut why my worthy DIGGORY do you not write how is it that so scrupulous a man in point of equity is so unexact a correspondent You are deep in my debt and though I am now rich in the inestimable treasures of reconciliation yet a line from you would add materially to my fortune and I should have to thank Heaven for as full a measure of felicity as it is perhaps either proper or possible to taste on this side of it  I am Dear Doctor Your most happy and faithful HORACE HOMESPUN  LETTER XLIV  Mrs  HOMESPUN  to Mrs  LA MOTTE  Madam  THE severity and rudeness in your letter I can pardon because they find an apology in your  want of breeding  but the liberty you take with me and my character cannot so readily be past over  I am  myself  the guardian of my honour  And will not brook so insolent a monitor  I am your deeplyinjured HARRIET HOMESPUN  LETTER XLV  From the Same to the Same  I WOULD give ten thousand worlds to stop the mail and take out of it my last mad and ingrateful letter even though I were to incur the punishment of robbing the post  Excuse me I beseech youexcuse the rashness of an enraged woman cut to the quick by your just reproaches Instead of resenting I beg of you to compassionate me My penitence is sincere and you must you  will  unite your prayers to mine that it may be at the same time perfect and efficient  Adieu HARRIET HOMESPUN  LETTER XLVI SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  HA ha ha There is no law against laughing in  a letter  as there is neither a vulgar noise nor a ghastly grin attending it take then the silent mirth of my soul and let me pour out upon paper some part of the exultation that at this moment swells my heart  What a superficial animal is man  as easily led by the nose as asses are  the dupe of the senses the idiots of mere exterior and the very fools of a wellmanaged set of features  It is usual with women when the  affair  is over to whimper lament the loss of reputation the destruction of their eternal peace of mind and grow stubbornly refractory or else sullenly repineing This was formerly a vile piece of business and was a sore drawback upon the felicity of fruition but the converts of CHESTERFIELD have no trouble of this sort to apprehend As the confessor can make the consent of a goodnatured nun a point of piety and religion so a man of manner dress address and dissimulation may manifestly prove to either maid wife or widow that the shortest as well as the softest conveyance to heaven is  upon a featherbed  Without any sort of hum haugh stammer or hesitation I have convinced HORACE that he has been notoriously in the wrong in consequence of which he is to kneel oftener than his professional bendings  requireI have firmly persuaded HARRIET that all our future pleasure depends on behaving ten times  better  than ever to HORACEand lastly I have prevailed on the curate to indulge his wife a few days longer as a first instance of his repentance In the rashness of her heart she hath told all to a  Mrs  LA MOTTE who hath written a chiding epistle in the old scolding way and to this I find she HARRIET hath replied in justification of herself Here I was obliged to set her right and have taken care to see her dispatch a penitential piece of  policy  which will bring all round again This same  Mrs  LA MOTTE is in a state of widowhood and much in love with her weedsa great beauty and I see by one of her letters which I  dissimulated  out of HARRIET a great  boaster  I furthermore understand that she is a constant churchgoer has a deliciously  demure set of muscles an elevated pair of eyesfolds the fair palm and holds long conversations betwixt GOD and her conscience  Now THORNTON if by setting  all  my mastermaxims in motionif by either the aids of genius stratagem and every exerted OMNIPOTENCY of the head heart hand and voice I could but lower the loftiness of this proudhearted  cottager  my soul would be satisfied and I should sacrifice to the shade of the invincible DORMER such a victim as might soothe his spirit and elevate his extacy in elysiumAt present this is in embrio onlyuningenderedIn all events I am determined as KING LEAR says  To do something  What it is yet I know not  But it shall strike the world c  Genius of STANHOPE assist me breathe into thy Pupil instant inspiration exalt my thoughtanimate megive me to bend the imperious heart of the confident LA MOTTE  Adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER XLVII  From the Same to the Same  I HAVE only a minute to spare and that is to tell thee I am the dullest dolt that Nature ever produced  That nobody might perceive my agitation of mind  by my countenance  and its treacherous changings I have rambled amongst the rocks and over the heathy hills of this execrable country to meditate upon the means of bringing LA MOTTE within the reach of my machinationsIt is not to be done and in the perfect stupidity and shame of my soul I am compelled to suspend the pursuit  Adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER XLVIII  Mrs  HOMESPUN  to Mrs  LA MOTTE  WRITE to me my dear LA MOTTE though it be but to sayHARRIET I do not hate you you have my pity and my prayers  HARRIET HOMESPUN  LETTER XLIX SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  THE matter of LA MOTTE must rest I cannot hit it off but have indeed other affairs to mind This HARRIET answers all my joyous purposes most delightfully while I am heating the fire for the tender FANNY who I understand is much better and is to be seen if the sun is not afraid of being outshone tomorrow to examine the bath  Accident  will no doubt  contrive  for me to be in view about the moment of her first appearance Her husbandbut of him hereafter  Postscript  HARRIET HOMESPUN wants capacity I am obliged to dictate her letters to this Mrs LA MOTTE who must be kept  in  with now she is in the secret  Adieu  PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER L  From the Same to the Same  THERE is nothing saith my creed  so delicate as a man's moral character and nothing which it is so much his  interest  to preserve pure  I have been at church THORNTON where HOMESPUN officiated as teacher He hath a snuffle in his nose his voice is destitute of that harmonious variety essential to all sorts of eloquence and his organs of articulation appear considerably obstructed  However I took him by the hand upon his descending from the pulpit returned him my sincere thanks in a  wellinvented compliment for the  elegance  of his discourse applauded his  delivery  lamented that I had not  often  been made so happy and almost brought the tears of virtue and vanity into the good man's eyes at the pathos of my conclusion  "There is no living in the world" you know THORNTON  without a complaisant indulgence for peoples weaknesses  In a short time I expect to reach the summit for after only an hour's practice I found myself able to call out a palpable tear only by placing a  chair  before my face and by the force of imagination representing  it  as a certain person in distress which I had an  interest  in relieving  And now I am talking upon the subject of sympathy I must tell thee THORNTON that I have made myself still more  popular than ever in this little place by several acts of  unostentatious ostentation  by giving occasional small sums to people who make it utterly unnecessary for me to be my  own  trumpeter There are a set of characters that will raise a benefactor's reputation without any drudgery on his side these people have  tongue  enough however poor they may be in other respects and all the good you do though silent and secret as the noon of night shall shine like  the light that shineth unto the perfect day  by means of those same grateful gossips  Adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER LI  From the Same to the Same  ONCE more receive an account of a tender transaction which I cannot conceal from thee Relating upon paper to the friend of one's heart for such thou art to me any business or event that hath afforded transport is an office of a pleasing kind  HARRIET is as richly formed by Nature for rapture as ever was woman and will I am in hopes soon be an adept in the  science  of pleasing Her person is voluptuous beyond painting and the joys it yields are only to be felt and yet I am almost reduced again to childishness  and am almost ready to fall again into my leadingstring notions by a very puerile accidenteven THORNTON by the lovetale of a green uninformed girl whose whole history I purchased for a single sixpence She hath been  ruined and undone  as she terms it by the basest of menAnd who dost thou think that man  is  THORNTONNeither more nor less than my fellow THOMAS who is I'll assure thee a wouldbe STANHOPEAN but trusting merely to pickedup preceptsthe very crumbs that have fallen from his master's tablehe stumbles in the effort and discovers his livery his dependency and his education even in his amours All this I enjoy thou knowestThe forsaken nymph came to complain of  my Mr  THOMAS She is very pretty and very loquacious but hear the story in her own words  THE STORY OF THE PRETTY BATHMAID  AN'T please your Honour I am but a servant and live by handing my water to gentryfolks I have tended the wellside since BUXTON bath became  famush  and nobody's tumbler was oftener filled than mine Till the week before last I was the happiest waterwench that ever dipt her glass in the well all the  qallety  knew me all the ladies loved me and all the gentlemen quarrelled which should drink first but matters are now altered and I am  asheamed  to take my  stand  at the place because of the baseness of your Honour's  unhonest  Mr THOMAS  The arts he has used to tangle me and take away my  wartue  are monstrous and such as would make the stoutest  she  in the country stumble I am sure for my part I stood it till I could stand it no longer If your Honour will hear me out and do me  justis  seeing as my character is gone and therewithal my water and with that my bread so that I have now neither bread  nor  water I will unfold everything and let your Goodness see the affair from top to bottom  Poor girl sit down sit down I am sorry for the loss of your water with all my heart and shall very chearfully see as much of the affair as you drink proper to shew meSit down therefore child and shew away  You must know Sir  as how  when bathing and drinking the waters is over and your Honour and suchlike fine folk are all busy adancing we servantpeople sometimes get together to a  lesserrer  room  and have a little hop of our own This happened the very first night I saw Mr THOMAS who I observed soon after he came into town walk round the well and then backwards and forwards and to be sure there was something in his putting his foot to the ground taking it off again swinging his arm flourishing his switch and saluting the fellowservants that made him look a king to the rest  Well Sir he  chus'd  me for his partner and tho' I say it I can shake a foot with my betters nay at a  country  dance I'll turn my back neither to gentle nor simple  If your Honour had heard the  highfliers  he crammed my poor head with all the while we were at itthe soft things he said while we led outthe  wows  he made as we handed up the middleand  the tender oaths and  rodermuntadoes  he swore while we right and left handed it or cast off and joined hands againwhile at the same time the music struck up enough to melt one's heartwith candles lighted and i' the summerseasonyour Honour would not blame me so much for giving away my soul and body to the most  artfullest  of his  sect  In short Sir he talkt me over so finely about  this  and  that  that before I left the room and we broke up I did not know whether I stood upon my head or my heels  After dancing was over and Mr THOMAS and I had made ourselves all of a heat or as I remembers  he  called it all of an  ardor  we took a walk in the grove by the hall to cool ourselves And  there  he began to flourish it againoverpowered  me with such an ocean of lovesayings and in short talked so different from my old sweetheart ROGER DOUSIT who is all dull and downright as I may say that I  declares  to your Honour he at last made me think it would be a sin to refuse him and soGod forgive meand so  And soyou did  not  refuse hey Is that it  Here the poor girl drew out her handkerchief and had sincerely a very great occasion for it  She told me in a tone THORNTON that touched me that if notwithstanding what THOMAS said she had been wicked she was a ruined woman that was all that it might do very well for  gentlefolks  to play false with one another because  they  had got  wherewithal  to wash all white  again but that a black spot in a  poor  woman who  pended  on her waterwas never to be rubbed outthat moreover the news had somehow got air and she was pointed at by all the illnatured fingers in the place She said with astonishing simplicity that the man fairly  overset  her with his newfangled  gibberish  but that she found 'twas all over with her She added that for her own part she did not so much mind it as she could turn her hand to anything and would leave the town in a twinkle but that she had an old mother that had been bedridden these eight months who lived at FAIRFIELD and who must now want bread as well as herself Nay for that matter said the girl she'll soon be provided for if she hears of my slip without troubling the parish for I shall soon break her heart I shall soon send my  poor old mother out of the world for she is a  good  woman Sir and would sooner bury me than see me what I am now DOUSIT will turn up his nose at me  now  and without your Honour makes Mr THOMAS do me  justis  so as that I may become honest again and do it in the lawful wayGod only knows what course I must take  She now dropt her tears THORNTON as fast to use the language of SHAKESPEARE  As the Arabian tree  Its medicinal gum  At this very moment THOMAS came in with a message on which he had been dispatched  What is it THORNTON what cursed troublesome thing is it at once invisible  and audacious that lodges in our bosoms beyond reach of our revenge to make the stoutest of us children and cowards  Never did GARRICK exhibit or SHAKESPEARE describe such a look and attitude as that of poor TOM at his entrance on observing so unexpected an object  He stammered he staggered he turned white and attempted to retreat  I commanded him to stay and taking my sword from the hook gave him his choice and one that might have puzzled a much wiser maneither to die or marry Fear operated even so strong as to make him chuse the latter  He fell on his knees and would have entered into explanations I would not  hear themThe ceremony that HAMLET uses with his quondam friends now passed between us and I made them both swear upon my sword  I promised them a dowerthe woman was in extacy and paid me by such a look of gratitude that had REYNOLDS been there he would have made the waterwench immortal by drawing it  I am above altercation of this THOMAS is aware Nay I believe he likes the girlThey shall be united as soon as possible and what the devil can be the reason that I am more happy in putting these two people together than all the joys I ever tasted with the exquisite and yielding HARRIET I cannot tell  Were it not that I have contrived as usual to get HORACE out of the way and that I never break an assignation I should certainly avoid seeing  her  or any body  else  this eveningIs not this unaccountable But  so  it is  Adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER LII THORNTON  to  SEDLEY  THE story of thy bathmaid interested me strangely and I have felt the more pleasure in giving it a tear because I perceive it hath penetrated even the almost invulnerable PHILIP SEDLEY  But how thou art able to stand the shock of so many radient eyes and yielded charmswrapt round and round as thou art in the elysium of voluntary and voluptuous embracesa young fellow of spirit toois to  me  most unaccountably mysteriousIn defiance of all the cautionary precepts of thy divine DORMERin defiance of all empiricismI  should certainly break out and even at the risque of overturning the whole wellwoven web of gallantry dwindle into a downright inamerato and quite lose the subtle distinction betwixt simulation and laudible insincerity  And so thou hadst the supreme of transport in uniting thy faithless footman to the beautiful bathmaid  I'll tell thee what SEDLEYthou art if thou wilt allow me for once the coinage of a new wordthou art but half CHESTERFIELDEDThe impression made upon thee by the pale face of the conscious THOMASthe pleasure thou hadst at wiping away the drops of penitence and perturbation from the cherry cheek of simplicityand thy wishing to soliloquise and be excused even from the arms of the tempting and  married  HARRIET  are all symptoms totally  unstanhopean  there's another word for thee  Take care SEDLEY thou art upon the eve of a relapsea relapse in favour not of DORMER but of downright DOUSIT'S singledealing  And yet my friend shall I once again confess to you my infirmitymy unestablishment in the maxims of thy PreceptorI cannot blame thy weaknesses nor can Ihowever destructive they may be to  thy  systemavoid wishing thou mayst continue thy present tendencies especially as by thy own honest confession thou hast found more gratification in them than in supporting the toilsome task of eternal disingenuity  Nor ought I indeed to  call  this a weakness in me If to be happy is the  ultimatum of all earthly pursuitsif it is equally the effort of every different order of men it assuredly follows that  that  conduct is the most rational by which the greatest share of felicity is procured The closest application of human wit and wisdom can do no more than point out to thee the most solid degree of joy and it matters not whether that joy is obtained by the practice of  one  system or  another  The last action thou hast recorded I allude to the promised nuptials of thy bathmaid was evidently agreeable to the sentiments of SENECA SOCRATES and all the wise and good men both of the East and West and since the precepts of STANHOPE have been unable to give thee a superior or even an  equal  felicity how proper and consistent with right reason is it in me to advise thee to walk  in that path wherein thou hast found the most pleasure Laugh notridicule not I beseech thee thou art not I hope so much a tool to the taste of the times so much a dupe to prejudiced opinionsas to dislike even the balance of bliss which is now in thy favour merely because the scale hath been turned by a worthy actionthat would be insanity  To love duplicity and certain sophistical distinctions merely for the sake of doubledealing and when plain clear clean uncrooked honesty will answer thy purpose much  better  is at once ridiculous and diabolical  On the whole therefore I advise thee in the deliberation of my heart to substitute the aforesaid SENECA or some other systematical moralist instead of STANHOPE and to lay  him  quickly  aside in a corner of thy trunk as unqualified to confer the comfort he professes to administer  And indeed SEDLEY to open my whole soul to thee I must own thee that I very much suspect his Lordship's sentiments Even in my occasional dealings here in Town since thy departure I have not been able to make them bear the test quite to my satisfaction such especially as relate to the suduction of the tender sex I made a slight experiment no longer ago than last night of his most favourite maxim namely to taste the joys of  security  mingled in embraces and yet though I do not think I conducted myself unadroitly it did not altogether answer the satisfaction he predicted to result from it  Thou art not a stranger to the elegancies  of SOPHIA VERNON the newmarried wife of the man whose promotion from ensign to lieutenant it was our joint endeavour some time ago to effect his gratitude is still  tremblingly alive all o'er  and by a natural consequence he is without the least tincture of suspicion and esteems every instance of particular enquiry after his wife or friend as a mark of generosity in his benefactor  This leaves the way to an intimacy with his SOPHIA fair and unobstructed and she has already caught so much of the Lieutenant's enthusiasm that she pays me the tribute of a rosyred blush of acknowledgment as often as I approach her They have lately purchased a pretty cottage amidst the vernal beauties of SURRY it is surrounded by gardens not  cittish  but genteel there are no nudities  no monstrous urns no fantastical fountains no chubby cherubims no tiptoed Mercury's smirking Venusses nor spruce hollyhedges 'tis all  true Nature to advantage dressed  the verdure is voluptuous the flowerbeds well weeded the shrubbery gratefully shaded and the alcove smiles upon the Thames  Within this alcove I yesterday took the tea that was prepared by the hand of SOPHIA whose husband had invited me pressingly to make the solitude of his lady more social by my company as he was himself under the necessity of taking a journey into SUSSEX  As you love brooks and books hills and rills my dear Mr THORNTON said he smilingly you and SOPHY will be able to pass away your time to your mutual satisfaction till the return of your friend  Poor unsuspicious pair  They united their entreaties and prevailed Lieutenant VERNON set out and left to thy friend  in trust  the most beautiful property upon the banks of the THAMES In a word he began his journey in the fragrant coolness of yesterday's evening and I was left at full liberty to abuse the confidence he placed in my integrity and in return for his hospitality do my utmost to destroy the chastity of  her  whom he doats upon with the sincerest tenderness  The tear which she dropt upon his hand as she kissed it at parting drew from him  another  accompanied by such a look as defies either tongue pen or pencil and went at the time so close to my heart that I could not but imagine the passion betwixt two was more exquisite  than if it were divided betwixt twoandtwenty One man and one woman thought I may certainly be happier than a Sultan and I had rather possess the real  undissimulated  love of a SOPHIA VERNON than command the keys of the seraglio  SOPHIA remained pensive and sighed after the travelling Lieutenant  I examined the little library for a book to entertain her CHESTERFIELD was there but I did not think it a proper book to read as I would wish to keep the maxims as far out of the sight of a female as possible for when a woman is  told the secret  of her seduction she will naturally be upon her guard against the seducer and really STANHOPE unfolds the art with such perspicuity that she who runs may read nay even thy  footman comprehends the whole system and hath according to thy account ruined his woman with a very  tolerable address  By the by SEDLEY I have to accuse thee of two weak pieces of conduct The first is thy rashness in trusting the epistles of thy Preceptor to the flighty HARRIET who might have heedlessly shewn them to HORACE by which means as thou art a very striking commentary upon the chapters of CHESTERFIELD he would have had a clue to the original sources of thy present conduct and a detection of this kind would have been totally insupportable Thy other fault is thy carelessness and I might say want of policy in exposing the volumes which thou so pretendest to venerate to the plebeian eyes of thy  valet  Lock them up I pray thee for the time to come and if  thou art resolved to proceed in reducing them to practice do it  privately  In regard to SOPHIA my endeavours to divert her thoughts  from  the beloved subject of their contemplation were in vain the Lieutenant mingled in every idea and she had passions sighs sentiments and sensations only for Mr VERNON I recited to her an elegy from HAMMOND and she wept in the sincerity of her heart over images so amiable and so similar to those now suggested by her  own  situation I wished to divert her by reading to her the oddities of corporal  Trim  and uncle  Toby  but she was in no disposition to be delighted with the whimsical strokes of a fine but irregular wit I even adverted to the irresistible sallies of HARRY FIELDING and displayed to her the masterpiece of narrative in the laughable  scene of Parson ADAMS pursued by the hounds and hunters She was proof even against this and afforded it only a faint smile She then tried what a walk in the garden would do she criticised the colours of the tulips and descanted with moral delicacy on the pleasing progress of vegetable Nature but alas even here a sigh would break in upon her remark and very evidently convince me that Pope was not so romantic in the pastoral sentiment which observes  Absence is surely death to those who love  In short SEDLEY whatever might be the temptation before me and however assiduous I was to gratify it it was not now the moment to begin the attack and everything I said only served to shew me more plainly that if I would wish to please her it must be by talking warmly of a man whom it was my interest to wean from her affections  Perceiving this I gave way to sympathy and most cordially united  my  tears to  hers  and joined in the most animated encomiums on her happy Lieutenant These tears however SEDLEY and those praises gave me a soothing softness not to be described and made me feel a thousand times more agreeable than while I repressed them in the hope of turning my thoughts to the husband's dishonour and the wife's destruction Is not this SEDLEY a parallel case to that of thine If thou wert more happy at doing a  just  action to thy bathmaid than at an  unjust  one by  undoing  the lively HARRIET I am more happy at having conquered an inclination which would have tormented my own fancy tortured a "generous trusting friend" and agonized the bosom of a woman whose reputation is at present unsuspected and unpolluted  Hence then my dear SEDLEY it appears that we are now both exulting in the triumph of a similar sensationa sensation created by the social virtues and derived purely from the felicity of others Upon this subject I have but one point to observe it is to  continue  the triumph Let us even cherish a transport which is superior to any that dissimulation can give let us throw away the perplexing mask of the casuistical CHESTERFIELD let us walk in the  right  way and since it hath already  rewarded  us so well let us prefer truth to falsehood and honesty to hypocrisy for believe me my dear dear SEDLEY under whatever name we may distinguish vice and virtue they remain eternally the same and neither sophistry nor subtlety nor fashion nor the sanctified follies of the mode can possibly palliate the atrociousness of the one or detract from the native excellence of the other PENMEN may puzzle PHILOSOPHERS  may refine POETS may colour and visionaries may suggest as they please but while the traces of Nature remain virtue will be fair and vice deformed and in my opinion that man's maxims are extremely contradictory and fallible who in the  same volume  nay sometimes in the  same epistle  inculcates a delicate regard to  moral  character and an attack upon those human  weaknesses  from the humouring of which assisted by a proper mixture of wellapplied flattery we are to prey upon each other to prepare ourselves for deceit and if the system were general introduce by these means even while we sanctify them the most dangerous delusions For my part SEDLEY I tell thee again and again that I find a flaw in thy STANHOPE and shall read him for the future with the eye of a severe critic and not an idolaternot a PHILIP SEDLEY  Farewel J THORNTON  LETTER LII SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  Prior to his Receipt of the last Letter  THE ceremony has been performed I insisted on its being done in the face of the congregation I gave THOMAS a purse for his weddingdinner and so the poor wench is again made an honest woman  Never heard I panegyrics more warm or better circulated than those reverberated from lip to lip upon this occasion and I could almost bless the fellow for a debauchery that hath added such lustre to my character I am the very ballad of  the bath and the negligence which I seem to pay to the praises only serves to increase and make me appear more deserving of them But what a simpleton I was in yielding to the baby sensation which seized me unawares in my last To do good is indeed  pleasing  and I will on that principle continue to do it as occasion invites but Is there not an higher motive thou wilt say than thisIs there not  religion  Pshaw  Yes pious THORNTON there is a higher motive It flatters the senses it gratifies vanity it procures  eclat  it promotes conquest it extends our triumph over a sex that was born for our amusementThe trifling action just recorded backed by a few more that I have not patience to recite hath made me so popular amongst all ranks of people in this village from my Lady in her bathingshift to her attendants  of the towel that I defy anything but my own folly to mark me as an object of suspicion  I have established my reputation THORNTON upon the solid basis of virtuous actions I have decorated the superstructure with the graces of conduct and now no man will dare to imagine this goodly edifice is but a  whitened  sepulchre Possibly thou mayst imagine that I have earned my pleasures by difficult adoption of the STANHOPEAN system No THORNTON I have a taste for them I do not  inflict excesses upon myself because I think them genteel  but I find these pursuits  guard me against frivolousness  and prevent me  from throwing away upon trifles that time which only important things deserve  In a word I tell thee once more I view the Lord of my Idolatry only as a man  more skilled than myself in the arts of being  truly  happy and in this light he deserves my everlasting gratitude for he hath taught me  to make every place I go to the scene of quick and lively transports to let every company I frequent gratify my  passions  to know the true value of time and to snatch seize and  enjoy  every moment of it  Of this enough the remainder of my letter shall be dedicated to the delicious purpose of recording several events which have fallen out by the joint effort of destiny and contrivance since my last  I have had a second glance at the delicate but decaying features of FANNY Tempted by the chearfulness of the morning she ventured under the supporting arms of a husband and sister to walk from her lodgings to the bathinghouse  She saw me but drew away her eye and never directed it towards me again Her husband bowed to me as to the polite stranger who had interested himself so much in the welfare of his beloved the sister inclined her head and curtesy'd  more  than civillyit was the bend rather of attention than ceremony  At this moment many a lankhaired swain yet humid with the bath and a cluster of women still glowing from the immersion appeared in view They were instantly attracted by the meteor gazed envied and passed on Well indeed  might  they gazewell might they envy THORNTON the rose again emulates the lilly in her cheek the blue is like the blue of the elements her arm is animated alabaster and the hand to which it belongs is shaped to  inspire  by its appearance and  enfever  by its touch  After this as she was preparing to return a servant came hastily to inform Mr MORTIMER that Sir HENRY DELMORE was arrived They quickened their pace a little even FANNY attempted to step briskly but failed in the effort The good Baronet was impatient and eager to behold his children came forward in his boots to meet them  Oh THORNTON what a figurehow noble how venerable how fashionable But alas all surprizes even those of the most pleasing kind are too much for the feeble situation of FANNY Her father soon saw her confusion softened it by a paternal kiss and assisted in conducing her home to her lodgings In something less than an hour I received the inclosed which is the luckiest incident in the world to me and which by  the time this reaches you I hope to improve to  some purpose  HARRIET HOMESPUN is fonder of me and better bred to HORACE than ever She has a wonderful aptitude to learn and will in time be no doubt a female STANHOPE What a lucky thing it is for us that HORACE hath so great an appetite for a long walk by himself after dinner and how infinitely  is  he and indeed  ought  he to be obliged to me for administering so much consolation to his wife in his absence  Surely THORNTON there is nothing so grateful as serving a friend  Adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER LIV  Sir  HENRY DELMORE  to  PHILIP SEDLEY  Esq  Inclosed in the above  Sir  I AM made truly happy at least as much so as the present situation of my family will admit to hear that I am again likely to be honoured by the company of a gentleman to whose society I am already indebted for so much pleasure It is no small addition Sir to this pleasing expectation to find that the many friendly enquiries that have from time to time  been made concerning the health of my poor FANNY proceeded from the very man to whom the father of that beautiful invalid owed so many agreeable hours at SCARBOROUGH  But how ceremonious was it Mr SEDLEY that you should all this while have estranged yourself and appeared only in the light of a person interested in the fate of the sick but not allied to the parent of that dear unfortunate by any closer or warmer reciprocations of a former friendship  I know for my part of but one way to excuse this punctilious behaviour and that is your embracing the first hour of your leisure to join your hand with that of Sir  Your most obedient and most humble servant H DELMORE  LETTER LV  The Reverend  HORACE HOMESPUN  to Doctor  DIGGORY  Dear Doctor  WHAT can possibly be the reason of your so long silence I now want your advice on a momentous subject  The time of my sojourning at this wateringplace is expired my curacy can no longer be deserted and I must return to it at all events on Saturday or the duty of the Sabbath must be neglected  Notwithstanding this Mrs HOMESPUN  again complains of her ancle and says the anguish of it is now got higher than her knee and she is therefore resolved to undergo the operation of pumping upon the part affected by which means I shall be obliged to leave her behind or else bring her away much against her own choice which notwithstanding my want of faith as to the knee and ancle I do not think myself entitled to do seeing that she hath demeaned herself most cordially The fact is she is quite in love with the frivolous pleasures of this puerile place in which were it not for the instructive and entertaining conversations of my friend SEDLEY I should not be able to support its customs As my wife however seems resolved I have thought of an expedient to supply my absence for a few days longer HARRIET hath a friend in our neighbourhooda Mrs LA MOTTEwho is a very discreet sensible  and judicious widowwoman and who I am persuaded will not only do me the service of passing a few days at the bath but likewise urge all the arguments of which she is mistress to wean the affections of her friend from this circle of vanity and reduce her once more to the standard of commonsense and the serene pleasures of a countryvillage  I want your council my dear DOCTOR on the following subject  Mr  SEDLEY has applied in my favour to the Bishop of respecting the living of which is worth near l per annum  Mr  SEDLEY is in hourly expectation of a reply to this and I am already so overwhelmed with the kindnesses of this worthy gentleman who hath done them in a manner peculiar to his character that I am in doubt whether I ought to increase a debt it will be ever beyond my  ability to discharge HARRIET'S little fortunes united to the profits of my curacy are sufficient to the purposes of a contented mind My parsonage you know DOCTOR is in the very bosom of a beautiful wood through which I have been accustomed to ramble with a social classic in my hand my parishioners love me the little garden is of my own cultivation I turned the arch and twisted the woodbines around my bower with my own fingers the birds are protected and nest with me in perfect security and if I could but once make HARRIET in love with it again I believe I should not quit it without a sigh But one circumstance weighs with me I have the dear prospect of a successor to  it  I owe an interest I should not feel for myself HARRIET is very far advanced in her pregnancy A child my dear friend enlarges the wishes of a father a tear is ready to  fall on my letter as I  think  upon the increase of my family To his offspring a man owes every thing Tell me then dear DIGGORY what I must do  Farewel I am yours HORACE HOMESPUN  LETTER LVI SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  THE plot begins to thicken and the catastrophe only demands good contrivance to be made delightful HORACE HOMESPUN goes away from the bath today in order to mount the rostrum and preach up the good old cause tomorrow HARRIET will be all this evening with me alone left wholly to my kindness and to crown the whole the scheme is at last laid to bring the haughtyhearted LA MOTTE within the reach of my machinations If there needs any further addition to these felicities know THORNTON that I am hand and glove with  Sir  HENRY DELMORE and hand and  heart  I  shall soon be with FANNY MORTIMER the enchanting DELIA looks not with eye inverted and MORTIMER himself hath made advances to intimacy Under these circumstances thou wilt not expect that I can attend to thy long epistolary sermon which I herewith reinclose thee for a present to the parson of thy parish against the death of Mrs ARABELLA thy grandam when it will afford many admirable hints for the funeral oration of that pious and puritanical old lady  Whenever thou sendest such a string of commonplace proverbs depend upon receiving them  again  and always with the charge of double postage So take the hint and thank me for the warning  Adieu PHILIP SEDLEY  LETTER LVII  Miss  DELIA DELMORE  to Lady  LUCY SAXBY  WHAT an additional degree of happiness do I feel since I last wrote to my beloved Lady LUCY My father is arrived my sister is recovering and we are become acquainted with a man whose company is at once pleasing instructive and various The very gentleman my dear LUCY who hath so frequently sent his polite cards of enquiry concerning FANNY proves to be a man of birth rank and character and wellknown both to  Sir  HENRY and  Mr  MORTIMER when they were last season at the bath of SCARBOROUGH He is  the most wellbred and complaisant character in the world and has at the first interview all the ease firmness and unembarrassed air of an old acquaintance The assured yet modest manner with which he presents himself to a company shews plainly that he has been long accustomed to fashionable societies and would charm you If FANNY continues to recover we shall be once more a joyful familymy mother is also down with us  We have taken part of a very elegant house only a short ride from the company about three miles distant from BUXTON and it stands upon a spot infinitely less bleak and barren than the uncomfortablelooking mountains that surround the bath I received the welcome epistle dear LUCY in which you enjoin me to fill up the interval of absence in a correspondence of wisdom wit sentiment  and affection but does not my fair friend forget that the requisites to form and to continue such an intercourse are not at the command of every scribbler though the partiality of Nature and the polish of highbreeding may confer them on herself However since you are so earnest with me I will pour out my soul imperfectly upon paper and though I may be wanting in point of elegance or accuracy the deficiencies will be compensated by a frankness of mind and an undisguise of sentiment that will pay a better compliment to my LUCY'S candour than all that could possibly be bestowed by the flowers of rhetoric or colourings of the imagination  I the more readily yield to your urgencies my LUCY as my pen at this period can only be the intelligencer of a felicity at once virtuous and endearing  It is said indeed that mankind have always some fantastical and visionary scheme in view I declare to you Lady SAXBY that the perfect restoration of FANNY'S health is the only drop that could now be added to the cup of our domestic joy Judge yourself for the visible alteration of Mrs MORTIMER for the better hath put me into such spirits that I cannot restrain my gratitude to the dear personages by which those spirits are inspired Take then my beloved LUCY the sketch of a familypicture drawn and yet not partially by the pencil of a relation  The first and principal figure in this group is a father whose mind is the repository of every virtuea repository in which he has been from hour to hour in the career of almost threescore years laying up something valuable till he hath at length stored it with every excellence  with all LUCY that can give worth to the husband softness to the parent solidity to the friend benevolence to the neighbour and humanity to the man to which is added a universal attention to the wants and complaints the fortunes and morals of that prodigious body of men to which he is related only by sameness of species and the conscious ties of the christian and fellowcreature  The second leading object in the piece is a mother the model of her husband and differing only by adapting the manly virtues to a delicacy more consistent with the refinement and gentleness of the female character and nature  The third figure to which I would direct your observation is the still lovely FANNY MORTIMERa woman whom even the depredations of four lingering  months passed in the languors of sickness have not rendered unattracting To a spirit at once wise and worthy she superadds the finest politeness gentleness uncommon and meekness peculiar to her and to these again are joined a taste elegant and simplean understanding enlarged and cultivatedand a face in defiance of distemper in which Heaven seems to have painted an attribute in every feature her eye sparkles benignity her lips are the temples of truth her cheeks are the emblems of modesty veiled in roses and her hands were formed by the Graces to the best of purposesto charm by their liberality the wretched into peace and to be consistently with their colour the pure and beautiful stewards of a heart tender as a turtle's yet solid as a sage's  The husband of this enchanting creature is the brother of Lady SAXBY the  very counterpart of his sister and the very youth whom Sir HENRY DELMORE adopted as the child of his affection undertook for several years the direction of his education supplied the loss of a father trained him up for his own and at last gave him allaccomplished to the only woman that could deserve himhis  daughter  His character is recorded in most of the European courts and it is but a mere reverberation of a familiar echo for  me  to say that he has been every where distinguished for bravery without rashness honour without ancestral pride elegance without vanity affection without interestedness and generosity without ostentation  Such LUCY are the outlines of a picture now under the eye of your friend Your absence however and FANNY'S uncertain state of health are the two dark  clouds that overcast my otherwise radiant horizon  In some measure however to atone for these indispensible drawbacks I can now promise an oftenrepeated intercourse in which through the kind medium of the post our pleasures with those of our families shall be reciprocatedButin the the name of extravagance where am I ramblingand what a metaphorical rhapsody am I going to send Let me hasten then to assure you that in all dispositions of mind I am with a tenderness peculiar to the truth of my attachment  Your affectionate DELIA DELMORE  LETTER LVIII SEDLEY  to  THORNTON  THE Fates surely are busied in contriving matters precisely as I would  have  them  The DELMORE'S are removed to a villa at some distance from BUXTON by which means I shall be able to prevent opposite interests from clashing with each otherI prithee THORNTON mark my policy to which I have even at the age of thirty sacrificed my  passion  Knowing the little scandals and fugitive whispers of a wateringplace I practised upon myself the STANHOPEAN selfdenial and have not been a single minute alone with HARRIET  since the departure of HORACE I contrive to call in either the loquacious landlord or chattering landlady and only conversed in their own way upon topics too trivial to send thee one hundred and sixty miles but which answered very well my purpose for strange as it may seem to thee I hold it not good policy or right reason to have a  teteatete  with a wife when her husband is  known  to have left the town nor am I very well pleased with the incautious HARRIET for suffering herself to be deserted and exposed to the report and  murder  of the moment for in these places where detraction is a  necessary  fillerup of the vacuum  At ev'ry word a reputation dies  And I would not be thought a libertine either in thought word or deed for the universe 'Tis expressly and flagrantly  against my system which thou knowest places the very perfection of human nature and the height of human abilities in "being upon our  own  guard and yet by a  seeming  natural openness to put people  off theirs"  Now in cases of amour it is in conformity to this principle absolutely necessary that a husband should be upon the premises though not upon the spot otherwise there is no possibility of avoiding mystery and mystery occasions suspicion and suspicion opens a door to detection and detection ruins me for ever The ordinary rake thou knowest piques himself upon this nay circulates it at the expence of his truth  He talks of transports that he never knew  And fancies raptures that he never felt  But the pupils of CHESTERFIELD are not such "rude vainglorious boasters" They are to preserve their moral sanctity even in the midst of what gownsmen call violation not only of good report but like the purity of Caesar's wife unsuspected  Oh may this ingenuity and wellacted dissimulation ever keep me from being blown upon and to this end may I never withdraw the dear veil that keeps me  apparently  pure one moment from my heart May I ever possess the ingenuous exterior with the reserved interior may I never reject as troublesome or useless the mastery of my temper and above all other things may I always possess myself enough to hear and see every thing without any visible change of countenance May no man living ever be able to decypher the secret of  my  heart and yet may  I keep the key of every  other  heart in the universe and to conclude my prayer let Hypocrisy place before me her shield under which I may fight my foolish antagonist for ever guarded and for ever victorious  And indeed THORNTON I perceive the adroitest practice of these several points suggested by the matchless DORMER will be shortly necessary for never did I enter so sagacious or so uniformly amiable a family as that of the DELMORES  The principal of it Sir HENRY is so acute so adorned so read so experienced that  he  must I perceive be deceived with a delicacy even beyond the deceptions of Belial and I wonder I did not lay myself open to discovery when at SCARBOROUGH at a time that I was a novice in  the ways of STANHOPE and could not be supposed to  copy him liberally  But my good genius preserved me and I engaged the hand of the father and struck hard upon the tender heart of his daughter  Then there's a formidable husband in my wayno HORACE HOMESPUNbut a man of travel experience tasteA second sister toothe lively DELIAa wit a corresponder a perfect penwoman and to close the list a venerable matron wisevirtuouspenetratingthe lady president of this bewitching association  What of that If they are not versed as I  believe  they are not in my maxims I may be a match for all of them pass like a meteor through this difficult hemispherekindle as I goand dread no radiant competitor  As to HARRIETthe affair is over nothing is left even for the exercise of my talents the precept by which I obtained her has been successful in practice all that remains is ITERATION Her fondness grows luxuriant and she may betray me To confess the truth THORNTON I am indifferent to her and I wish HORACE had her locked in his arms to eternity with all my soul  At all events she must not entertain such ardent expectationsforI am summoned elsewherea scene of greater difficulty greater delicacy and greater delight expands itself before methe halfconqueredhalfexpiring FANNY MORTIMER who must not descend unenjoyed by SEDLEY to the earthThe worm THORNTON must not be suffered to riot on her beauties 'twould be a pitya profanation  The exquisite and vivacious DELIA also attracts my notice I am called to the combat and I must exert every nerve to  triumph  in the combat of which the laurels will be trebly precious since I perceive they must be earned with all the artillery of manner address and assurance  In pursuance of these objects I shall probably be often animated into the  wish  of enjoyments that it may be impolitic to push  too far  till every thing is ripe for the  coup de grace  In such exigences it is difficult to keep the rein in my hand the warmth of imagination and an acquaintance with objects and situations calculated to fire it seem inconsistent with the necessary coolness and command of my temper  To provide therefore against these moments of ardour I shall if LA MOTTE comes down retain the enamoured HARRIET in my train as the agreeable resource from the agitations in which it is likely I shall be thrown by the charms delays or impediments of the DELMORES Possibly too something may fall out to reduce LA MOTTE which be her personal endowments what they may is desirable because she is prepared to suspect my principles and therefore will engage my more serious attention till she shall have little reason to ridicule or laugh at her friend  But on the other hand if this LA MOTTE does  not  move at the injunction of HORACE nor at the pretended penitence of the letterloving HARRIET and by these means HARRIET should be left  to herself she must absolutely return to the bosom of the poor pedant and I will assuredly sacrifice the possession of her person to the unblemished security of  my  character which I am aware must inevitably suffer by being avowedly the Cicisbeo of a wife little distinguished amongst the bathers and waterbibbers of fashion  If indeed she had been blessed with a sallow damsel for a sister or a prudent gentlewoman for her aunt it might have been another matter but I again repeat it to you that in a place like this in this sneaking inquisitive country of Britain it is to all intents and purposes requisite for the security of my system that there should be some third person in a family by way of screen and rather than have our mistresses alone that is unprotected by some ostensible he or she  that is answerable for them in the parish where they visit or where they reside it is better for  our  plan of action that we are sheltered under the withered wing of a maiden cousin of a century's standing or even of the greatgrandmother herself  And now THORNTON for a word or two on thy own affairs If thou hast not by this time surmounted the ticklings of thy conscience and taken possession of that tender tenement which thy friend the Lieutenant left to thee thou deservest to be for ever discarded  What Hast thou an angel in "earth's mould" Is she in a wilderness of sweets Art thou invited by a bed of roses Art thou neither in fear of being blasted by detection nor of incurring the prattle of a single gossip of either sex seeing that  thou art in a retirement perfectly shaded by a shrubbery of perfumes and apart from a second house and Is the good man of the house gone a long journey into a far countryIs all this in the way of propitiating thy advances masked as I presume they would be in the fine veil of modesty manner and firmness  each  like copartners whose interest it is to promote commonright in the same business assisting the  other  and Dost thou after all boggle at a shadowa maukinat conscience  Admitting even all thy wishes crowned with successwhere's the mischief Thou dost not despoil her the Lieutenant is ignorant of what is granted as of what was never attempted The STANHOPE scheme of fruition suffers us not to do any  real  injury to individuals  singly  or to the community  collectively we are neither to betray the wife nor to call the husband the cuckold we have had the honour to make him nor to breathe an accent that may lead to the remotest suspicion In some cases THORNTON this system is of the utmost service under the STANHOPEAN restrictions I mean both to our King and country  How many puny striplings are there who cannot do the common rights of nuptial justice to the unhappy creatures that either interest or folly has chained them to for life In that instance it is ours to bestow as a  favour  what the husbands cannot discharge as a  duty  On the other hand how many miserable pairs are there sighing for an heir to an unweildy estate which must in default of  issue devolve to the next fool or driveller in descent There again  we  are patriots of the first order Do we not provide a successor and create a being to inherit all the luxuries of life  Nay even supposing the husband enabled to provide for himself while our system dictates so inviolable a  secrecy  while the joys of it are not invaded by  distemper  and they can never be granted without the prior consent of the wife and such consent implies that such variety is necessary to her happinessno injury can in effect be incurred His  own  offspring we cannot destroy and  ours  will be considered as legitimate and not be exposed like the byblows of the rake to the scorn desertion and illfortunes of bastardy So that view the system of CHESTERFIELD on which side soever you  will it is a system of policy prudence pleasure goodfellowship and right reason  Great length of paper and much time have I stolen from more agreeable pursuits to illustrate this to thee and if it move thee not thou art altogether impenetrable and not deserving so sublime a friend as the  immaculate  PHILIP SEDLEY  END of the FIRST VOLUME
