 portrait of Alexander Pope  M  r  POPE  Mr POPE's  Literary Correspondence  For Thirty Years from to BEING A COLLECTION of LETTERS Which passed between him and Several Eminent Persons  VOLUME the First  LONDON  Printed for E CURLL in  Rosestreet    Covent Garden  MDCCXXXV  PREFACE  _WE presume we want no Apology to the Reader for this Publication but some may be thought needful to Mr  Pope  However he cannot think our Offence so great as Theirs who first separately published what we have here but collected in a better Form and Order As for the Letters we have procured to be added they serve but to compleat explain and sometimes set in a true light those others which it was not in the Writer's or Our power to recall  This Collection hath been owing to several Cabinets some drawn from thence by Accidents and others even of those to Ladies voluntarily given It is to one of that Sex we are beholden for the whole Correspondence with  H C  Esq  which Letters being lent her by that Gentleman she took the Liberty to print as appears by the following which we shall give at length both as it is something curious and as it may serve for an Apology for our selves  To HENRY CROMWELL  Esq  June  AFTER so long a silence as the many and great oppressions I have sigh'd under has occasion'd one is at a Loss how  to begin a letter to so kind a friend as your self But as it was always my resolution if I must sink to do it as decently that is as silently as I cou'd so when I found my self plung'd into unforeseen and unavoidable ruin I retreated from the world and in a manner buried my self in a dismal place where I knew none nor none knew me In this dull unthinking way I have protracted a lingring death for life it cannot be call'd ever since you saw me sequester'd from company depriv'd of my books and nothing left to converse with but the Letters of my dead or absent friends amongst which latter I always plac'd your's and Mr  Pope  's in the first rank I lent some of them indeed to an ingenious person who was so delighted with the specimen that he importuned me for a sight of the rest which having obtained he convey'd them to the Press I must not say altogether with my consent nor wholly without it I thought them too good to be lost in oblivion and had no cause to apprehend the disobliging of any The publick  viz  all persons of taste and judgment wou'd be pleas'd with so agreeable an amusement Mr  Cromwell  cou'd not be angry since it was but justice to his merit to publish the solemn and private professions of Love Gratitude and Veneration  made him by so celebrated an Author and surely Mr  Pope  ought not to resent the publication since the early pregnancy of his Genius was no dishonour to his character And yet had either of you been ask'd common modesty wou'd have oblig'd you to refuse what you wou'd not be displeas'd with if done without your knowledge And besides to end all dispute you had been pleas'd to make me a free gift of them to do what I pleas'd with them and every one knows that the person to whom a Letter is address'd has the same right to dispose of it as he has of goods purchas'd with his money I doubt not but your generosity and honour will do me the right of owning by a line that I came honestly by them I flatter my self in a few months I shall again be visible to the world and whenever thro' good providence that Turn shall happen I shall joyfully acquaint you with it there being none more truly your oblig'd Servant than  Sir  Your faithful and most humble Servant E THOMAS  P S  A Letter Sir directed to Mrs  Thomas  to be left at my house will be safely transmitted to her by  Yours  c  E CURLL  To Mr POPE  Epsom  July  WHEN these Letters were first printed I wond'red how  Curll  cou'd come by 'em and cou'd not but laugh at the pompous title since whatever you wrote to me was humour and familiar Raillery As soon as I came from  Epsom  I heard you had been to see me and I writ you a short letter from  Will  's that I long'd to see you Mr  D  s  about that time charg'd me with giving 'em to a Mistress which I positively denied not in the least at that time thinking of it but some time after finding in the newspapers Letters from Lady  Packington  Lady  Chudleigh  and Mr  Norris  to the same  Sapho  or  E T  I began to fear that I was guilty I have never seen these Letters of  Curll  's nor wou'd go to his shop about them I have not seen this  Sapho  alias  E T  these seven yearsher writing  That I gave her 'em to do what she wou'd with 'em  is straining the point too far I thought not of it nor do I think she did then But severe Necessity which catches hold of a Twig has produced all this which has lain hid and forgot by me so many years  Curll  sent me a Letter last week desiring a positive answer about this matter but finding  I wou'd give him none he went to  E T  and writ a Postscript in her long romantic Letter to direct my Answer to his house but they not expecting an Answer sent a young man to me whose name it seems is  Pattisson  I told him I shou'd not write any thing but I believ'd it might be so as she writ in her Letter I am extremely concern'd that my former Indiscretion in putting 'em into the hands of this  Pretieuse  shou'd have given you so much disturbance for the last thing I shou'd do wou'd be to disoblige you for whom I have ever preserv'd the greatest esteem and shall ever be  Sir    Your faithful Friend and most humble Servant HENRY CROMWELL  To Mr POPE  August  THO' I writ my long Narrative from  Epsom  'till I was tir'd yet was I not satisfied lest any doubt shou'd rest upon your mind I cou'd not make protestations of my Innocence of a grievous crime but I was impatient 'till I came to Town that I might send you those Letters as a clear evidence that I was a perfect stranger to  all their proceeding Shou'd I have protested against it after the printing it might have been taken for an attempt to decry his purchase and as the little exception you have taken has serv'd him to play his game upon us for these two years a new incident from me might enable him to play it on for two moreThe great value she expresses for all you write and her passion for having 'em I believe was what prevail'd upon me to let her keep 'em By the interval of twelve years at least from her possession to the time of printing 'em 'tis manifest that I had not the least ground to apprehend such a design But as People in great straits bring forth their hoards of old Gold and most valued Jewels so  Sapho  had recourse to her hid treasure of Letters and play'd off not only your's to me but all those to herself as the Lady's laststake into the pressAs for me I hope when you shall cooly consider the many thousand instances of our being deluded by the females since that great Original of  Adam  by  Eve  you will have a more favourable thought of the undesigning error of  Your faithful Friend and humble Servant HENRY CROMWELL  Now should our Apology for this Publication be as ill receiv'd as the Lady's seems to have been by the Gentlemen concerned we shall at least have  Her Comfort  of being Thank'd by the rest of the world Nor has Mr  P  himself any great cause to think it much Offence to his Modesty or Reflexion on his Judgment when we take care to inform the Public that there are few Letters of his in this Collection which were not written under Twenty years of Age On the other hand we doubt not the Reader will be much more surpriz'd to find at that early period so much variety of Style Affecting Sentiment and Justness of Criticism in pieces which must have been writ in haste very few perhaps ever review'd and none intended for the Eye of the Public  LETTERS OF Sir WILLIAM TRUMBULL Mr STEELE Mr ADDISON and Mr POPE From to  portrait of Joseph Addison  M  r  Addison  Secretary of State to King  William  the Third  Sir WILLIAM TRUMBULL to Mr POPE  I HAVE this moment receiv'd the favour of yours of the th instant and will make you a true excuse tho' perhaps no very good one that I defer'd the troubling you with a letter when I sent back your Papers in hopes of seeing you at  Binfield  before this time If I had met with any fault in your performance I should freely now as I have done too presumptuously in conversation with you tell  you my opinion which I have frequently ventur'd to give you rather in compliance with your desires than that I could think it reasonable For I am not yet satisfied upon what grounds I can pretend to judge of Poetry who never have been practis'd in the Art There may possibly be some happy genius's who may judge of some of the natural beauties of a Poem as a man may of the proportions of a building without having read  Vitruvius  or knowing any thing of the rules of architecture But this tho' it may sometimes be in the right must be subject to many mistakes and is certainly but a superficial knowledge without entring into the art the methods and the particular excellencies of the whole composure in all the parts of it  Besides my want of skill I have another reason why I ought to suspect my self by reason of the great affection I have for you which might give too much biass to be kind to every thing that comes from you but after all I must say and I do it with an oldfashion'd sincerity that I entirely approve of your Translation of those Pieces of  Homer  both as to the versification and the true sense that shines thro' the whole nay I am confirmed in my former application to you and give me leave to renew it upon this occasion that you  wou'd proceed in translating that incomparable Poet to make him speak good  English  to dress his admirable characters in your proper significant and expressive conceptions and to make his works as useful and instructive to this degenerate age as he was to our friend  Horace  when he read him at  Praeneste Qui quid sit pulchrum quid turpe quid utile quid non  c I break off with that  quid non  with which I confess I am charm'd  Upon the whole matter I intreat you to send this presently to be added to the Miscellanies and I hope it will come time enough for that purpose  I have nothing to say of my Nephew  B  's observations for he sent them to me so late that I had not time to consider them I dare say he endeavour'd very faithfully tho' he told me very hastily to execute your commands  All I can add is that if your excess of modesty shou'd hinder you from publishing this  Essay  I shall only be sorry that I have no more credit with you to persuade you to oblige the publick and very particularly dear Sir  Your most faithful humble Servant W Trumbull  April  Mr POPE to the Hon J C  Esq  June  I Send you  Dennis  's remarks on the  On Criticism  Essay  which equally abound in just Criticisms and fine Railleries The few observations in my hand in the margins are what a morning's leisure permitted me to make purely for your perusal For I am of opinion that such a Critic as you will find him by the latter part of his book is but one way to be properly answer'd and that way I wou'd not take after what he informs me in his preface that he is at this time persecuted by Fortune This I knew not before if I had his name had been spar'd in the  Essay  for that only reason I can't conceive what ground he has for so excessive a resentment nor imagine how those  But  Appius  reddens at each word you speak  And stares tremendous with a threatning eye  Like some fierce Tyrant in old Tapestry  three lines can be call'd a reflection on his  Person  which only describe him subject a little to Anger on some occasions I have heard of combatants so very furious as to fall  down themselves with that very blow which they design'd to lay heavy on their antagonists But if Mr  Dennis  's rage proceeds only from a zeal to discourage young and unexperienc'd writers from scribling he shou'd frighten us with his Verse not Prose for I have often known that when all the precepts in the world would not reclaim a sinner some very sad example has done the business  This Thought we find afterwards put into Verse in the  Dunciad    Book    Yet to give this man his due he has objected to one or two lines with reason and I will alter 'em in case of another edition I will make my enemy do me a kindness where he meant an injury and so serve instead of a friend What he observes at the bottom of page th of his reflections was objected to by yourself and had been mended but for the haste of the press 'Tis right  Hibernian  and I confess it what the  English  call a  Bull  in the expression tho' the sense be manifest enough Mr  Dennis  's Bulls are seldom in the expression they are always in the sense  I shall certainly never make the least reply to him not only because you advise me but because I have ever been of opinion that if a book can't answer for itself  to the publick 'tis to no sort of purpose for its author to do it If I am wrong in any sentiment of that  Essay  I protest sincerely I don't desire all the world should be deceiv'd which wou'd be of very ill consequence meerly that I my self may be thought right which is of very little consequence I'd be the first to recant for the benefit of others and the glory of my self for as I take it when a man owns himself to have been in an error he does but tell you in other words that he is wiser than he was But I have had an advantage by the publishing that book of  D  s  's which otherwise I should never have known It has been the occasion of making me friends and open abetters of several gentlemen of known sense and wit and of proving to me what I have till now doubted that my writings are taken some notice of by the world in general or I should never be attack'd thus in particular I have read that 'twas a custom among the  Romans  while a General rode in triumph to have common soldiers in the streets that rail'd at him and reproach'd him to put him in mind that tho' his services were in the main approved and rewarded yet he had faults enough to keep him humble  You will see by this that whoever sets up for wit in these days ought to have the constancy of a primitive Christian and be prepar'd to suffer martyrdom in the cause of it But sure this is the first time that a Wit was attack'd for his  Religion  as you'll find I am most zealously in this treatise and you know Sir what alarms I have had from the  See the ensuing Letters  opposite side on this account Have I not reason to cry out with the poor fellow in  Virgil  Quid jam misero mihi denique restat  Cui neque apud  Danaos  usquam locus super ipsi  Dardanidae  infensi paenas cum Sanguine poscunt  'Tis however my happiness that you Sir are impartial  Jove  was alike to  Latian  and to  Phrygian  For you well know that Wit's of no Religion  The manner in which Mr  D  takes to pieces several particular lines detach'd from their natural places may shew how easy it is to a caviller to give a new sense or  a new nonsense to any thing And indeed his constructions are not more wrested from the genuine meaning than theirs who objected to the heterodox parts as they call'd 'em  Our friend the  Abbè  is not of that sort who with the utmost candour and freedom has modestly told me what others thought and shewn himself one as he very well expresses it rather of a  Number  than a  Party  The only difference between us in relation to the Monks is that he thinks most sorts of learning flourish'd among 'em and I am of opinion that only some sort of learning was barely kept alive by 'em he believes that in the most natural and obvious sense that line  A second deluge Learning overrun  will be understood of Learning in general and I fancy 'twill be understood only as 'tis meant of polite Learning Criticism Poetry  c  which is the only learning concern'd in the subject of the  Essay  It is true that the  Monks  did preserve what learning there was about  Nicholas  the Fifth's time but those who succeeded fell into the depth of Barbarism or at least stood at a stay while others rose from thence insomuch that even  Erasmus  and  Reuchlin  could hardly laugh them out of it I am highly oblig'd to the  Abbè  's zeal in my commendation and goodness  in not concealing what he thinks my error And his testifying some esteem for the book just at a time when his brethren rais'd a clamour against it is an instance of great generosity and candor which I shall ever acknowledge  Your  c  To the same  June  IN your last you inform'd me of the mistaken zeal of some people who seem to make it no less their business to persuade men they are erroneous than Doctors do that they are sick only that they may magnify their own cure and triumph over an imaginary distemper The Simile objected to in my  Essay  Thus wit like faith by each man is apply'd  To one small Sect and all are damn'd beside  plainly concludes at this second line where stands a full stop and what follows  Meanly they seek  c speaks only of  Wit  which is meant by  that blessing  and  that sun  for how can the sun of  faith  be said  to  sublime the southern wits  and to  ripen the genius's of northern climates  I fear these gentlemen understand grammar as little as they do criticism and perhaps out of good nature to the Monks are willing to take from 'em the censure of ignorance and to have it to themselves The word  They  refers as I am sure I meant and as I thought every one must have known to those critics there spoken of who are partial to some particular sett of writers to the prejudice of all others And the very simile it self if twice read may convince them that the censure here of damning lies not on our Church at all unless they call our Church  one small Sect  and the cautious words  by each Man  manifestly show it a general reflection on all such whoever they are who entertain those narrow and limited notions of the mercy of the Almighty which the Reform'd ministers and Presbyterians are as guilty of as any people living  Yet after all I promise you Sir if the alteration of a word or two will gratify any man of sound faith tho' weak understanding I will tho' it were from no other principle than that of common good nature comply with it And if you please but to particularize the spot where their objection lies for it is in a very narrow  compass that stumblingblock tho' it be but a little pebble shall be removed out of their way If the heat of these good disputants who I am afraid being bred up to wrangle in the schools cannot get rid of the humor all their lives shou'd proceed so far as to personal reflections upon me I assure you notwithstanding I will do or say nothing however provok'd for some people can no more provoke than oblige that is unbecoming the character of a true Catholick I will set before me the example of that great man and great Saint  Erasmus  who in the midst of calumny proceeded with all the calmness of innocence and the unrevenging spirit of primitive christianity However I wou'd advise them to suffer the mention of  him  to pass unregarded lest I should be forc'd to do that for his reputation which I wou'd never do for my own I mean to vindicate so great a light of our Church from the malice of past times and the ignorance of the present in a language which may extend farther than that in which the Trifle about Criticism is written I wish these gentlemen wou'd be contented with finding fault with me only who will submit to 'em right or wrong as far as I only am concern'd I have a greater regard to the quiet of mankind than to disturb it  for things of so little consequence as my credit and my sense A little humility can do a Poet no hurt and a little Charity wou'd do a Priest none For as St  Austin  finely says  Ubi Charitas ibi Humilitas ubi Humilitas ibi Pax  Yours  c  To the same  July  THE concern which you more than seem to be affected with for my reputation by the several accounts you have so obligingly given of what reports and censures the holy  Vandals  have thought fit to pass upon me makes me desirous of telling so good a friend my whole thoughts of this matter and of letting before you in a clear light the true state of it  I have ever believ'd the best piece of service one cou'd do to our religion was openly to express our detestation and scorn of all those mean artifices and  Piae fraudes  which it stands so little in need of and which have laid it under so great a scandal among its enemies  Nothing has been so much a scarecrow to them as that too peremptory and seeminglyuncharitable assertion of an utter  Impossibility  of  Salvation  to all but ourselves  invincible  ignorance excepted which indeed some people define under so great limitations and with such exclusions that it seems as if that word were rather invented as a salvo or expedient not to be thought too bold with the thunderbolts of God which are hurl'd about so freely on almost all mankind by the Hands of ecclesiasticks than as a real exception to almostuniversal damnation For besides the small number of the truly faithful in our Church we must again subdivide the  Jansenist  is damned by the  Jesuit  the  Jesuit  by the  Jansenist  the  Scotist  by the  Thomist  and so forth  There may be errors I grant but I can't think 'em of such consequence as to destroy utterly the charity of mankind the very greatest bond in which we are engag'd by God to one another Therefore I own to you I was glad of any opportunity to express my dislike of so shocking a sentiment as those of the religion I profess are commonly charg'd with and I hop'd a slight insinuation introduc'd so easily by a casual similitude only cou'd never have given offence but on the contrary must  needs have done good in a nation and time where we are the smaller party and consequently most misrepresented and most in need of vindication  For the same reason I took occasion to mention the  Superstition  of some ages after the subversion of the  Roman Empire  which is too manifest a truth to be deny'd and does in no sort reflect upon the present professors of our faith who are free from it Our silence in these points may with some reason make our adversaries think we allow and persist in those bigottries which yet in reality all good and sensible Men despise tho' they are persuaded not to speak against 'em I can't tell why since now 'tis no way the interest even of the worst of our Priesthood as it might have been then to have them smother'd in silence For as the opposite Sects are now prevailing 'tis too late to hinder our church from being slander'd 'tis our business now to show it is slander'd unjustly and to vindicate ourselves from being thought abettors of what they charge us with This can't so well be brought about with serious faces we must laugh with them at what deserves it and then we need not doubt of being clear'd ev'n in their opinions  As to particulars you cannot but have observ'd that at first the whole objection against the simile of wit and faith lay to the word  They  When that was beyond contradiction removed the very Grammar serving to confute 'em then the objection lies against the  Simile itself  or if that simile will not be objected to sense and common reason being indeed a little stubborn and not apt to give way to every body next the mention of  Superstition  must become a crime as if  Religion  and she were sisters or that it were a scandal upon the family of  Christ  to say a word against the Devil's bastard Afterwards more mischief is discover'd in a place that seem'd innocent at first the two lines about  Schismatics  at the bottom of page An ordinary man wou'd imagine the author plainly declar'd against those schismatics for quitting the true faith out of contempt of the understanding of some few of its believers But these believers are call'd  Dull  and because I say that  those Schismatics  think  some  believers  dull  therefore these charitable interpreters of my meaning will have it that  I  think  all  believers dull I was telling lately Mr  these objections who assured me I had said nothing which a Catholick need to disown  and I have cause to know that gentleman's fault if he has any is not want of zeal He put a notion into my head which I confess I can't but perfectly acquiesce in that when a sett of people are piqu'd at any truth which they think to their own disadvantage their method of revenge on the truthspeaker is to attack his reputation a Byway and not openly to object to the place they are really gall'd by What these therefore in his opinion are in earnest angry at is that  Erasmus  whom their tribe oppress'd and persecuted shou'd be vindicated after an age of obloquy by one of their own people willing to utter an honest truth in behalf of the dead whom no man sure will flatter and to whom few will do justice Others you know were as angry that I mention'd Mr  Walsh  with honour who as he never refused to any one of merit of any party the praise due to him so honestly deserv'd it from all others tho' of ever so different interests or sentiments May I be ever guilty of this sort of liberty and latitude of principle which gives us the hardiness of speaking well of those whom envy oppresses ev'n after death As I wou'd always speak well of my living friends when they are absent nay because  they are absent so would I much more of the dead in that eternal absence and the rather because I expect no thanks for it  Thus Sir you see I do in my conscience persist in what I have written yet in my friendship I will recant and alter whatever you please in case of a second edition which I think the book will not so soon arrive at for  Tonsons  's printer told me he drew off a thousand copies in this first impression and I fancy a treatise of this nature which not one gentleman in threescore even of a liberal education can understand can hardly exceed the vent of that number You shall find me a true  Trojan  in my faith and friendship in both which I will presevere to the end  Your  c  To General upon his having translated into  French  Verse the  Essay on Criticism  IF I could as well express or if you will allow me to say it translate the sentiments of my heart as you have done  those of my head in your excellent version of my Essay I should not only appear the best writer in the world but what I much more desire to be thought the most your servant of any man living 'Tis an advantage very rarely known to receive at once a great honour and a great improvement This Sir you have afforded me having at the same time made others take my sense and taught me to understand my own if I may call that my own which is indeed more properly yours Your verses are no more a translation of mine than  Virgil  's are of  Homer  but are like his the justest Imitation and the noblest Commentary  In putting me into a  French  dress you have not only adorned my outside but mended my shape and if I am now a good figure I must consider you have naturaliz'd me into a country which is famous for making every man a fine gentleman It is by your means that contrary to most young travellers I am come back much better than I went out  I cannot but wish we had a bill of commerce for Translation established the next parliament we could not fail of being gainers by that nor of making our selves amends for all we have lost by the war Nay tho' we should insist upon the  demolishing  of  Boileau  's works the  French  as long as they have writers of your form might have as good an Equivalent  Upon the whole I am really as proud as our ministers can be of the terms I have gain'd from abroad and I design like them to publish speedily to the world the benefits accruing from them for I cannot resist the temptation of printing your admirable translation here  This was never done for the two printed  French  Versions are neither of this hand The one was the work of Monsieur  Roboton  private  ecretary to King  George  the first printed in  o  at  Amsterdam  and at  London  The other by the Abbè  Resnel  in  o  with a large Preface and Notes at  Paris    to which if you will be so obliging to give me leave to prefix your name it will be the only addition you can make to the honour already done me I am  Your  c  The Hon J C to Mr POPE  May  I AM very glad for the sake of the Widow and for the credit of the deceas'd  that  A Translation of some Part of  Chaucer  's  Canterbury Tales  the  Prologues  c printed in a Miscellany with some works of Mr  Pope  in Vol o by  B Lintot  Betterton  's remains are fallen into such hands as may render 'em reputable to the one and beneficial to the other Besides the publick acquaintance I long had with that poor man I also had a slender knowledge of his parts and capacity by private conversation and ever thought it pity he was necessitated by the straitness of his fortune to act and especially to his latest hours an imaginary and fictitious part who was capable of exhibiting a real one with credit to himself and advantage to his neighbour  I hope your health permitted you to execute your design of giving us an imitation of  Pollio  I am satisfy'd 'twill be doubly  Divine  and I shall long to see it I ever thought churchmusick the most ravishing of all harmonious compositions and must also believe sacred subjects well handled the most inspiring of all Poetry  But where hangs the  Lock  now tho' I know that rather than draw any just reflection upon your self of the least shadow of illnature you would freely have supprest one of the best of Poems I hear no more of itwill it comee out in  Lintot  's  Miscellany or not I wrote to Lord  Petre  upon the subject of the Lock some time since but have as yet had no answer nor indeed do I know when he'll be in  London  I have since I saw you corresponded with Mrs  W  I hope she is now with her Aunt and that her journey thither was something facilitated by my writing to that Lady as pressingly as possible not to let any thing whatsoever obstruct it I sent her obliging answer to the party it most concern'd and when I hear Mrs  W  is certainly there I will write again to my Lady to urge as much as possible the effecting the only thing that in my opinion can make her Niece easy I have run out my extent of paper and am  Your  c  Mr POPE's Answer  May  IT is not only the disposition I always have of conversing with you that makes me so speedily answer your obliging letter but the apprehension lest your charitable intent of writing to my Lady  A  on Mrs  W  's affair should be frustrated by the short stay she makes there She went thither on the th with that mixture of expectation and anxiety with which people usually go into unknown or halfdiscover'd countries utterly ignorant of the dispositions of the inhabitants and the treatment they are to meet with The Unfortunate of all people are the most unfit to be left alone yet we see the world generally takes care they shall be so Whereas if we took a considerate prospect of human nature the business and study of the happy and easy shou'd be to divert and humour as well as comfort and pity the distressed I cannot therefore excuse some near Allies of mine for their conduct of late towards this Lady which has given me a great deal of anger as well as sorrow All I shall say to you of 'em at present is that they have not been my relations these two months The consent of opinions in our minds is certainly a nearer tye than can be contracted by all the blood in our bodies and I am proud of finding I have something congenial with you Will you permit me to confess to you that all the favours and kind offices you have shown towards Me have not so strongly cemented me yours as the discovery of that generous and manly compassion you manifested  in the case of this unhappy Lady I am afraid to insinuate to you how much I esteem you Flatterers have taken up the style which was once peculiar to friends and an honest man has now no way left to express himself besides the common one of knaves So that true friends nowadays differ in their address from flatterers much as right mastiffs do from sp  niels and show themselves by a dumb surly sort of fidelity rather than by their complaisant and open kindnessWill you never leave commending my Poetry In fair truth Sir I like it but too well myself alreadyExpose me no more I beg you to the great danger of Vanity the rock of all men but most of young men and be kindly content for the future when you wou'd please me throughly to say only you like what I write  Your  c  Mr STEELE to Mr POPE  June  I AM at a solitude an house between  Hampstead  and  London  wherein Sir  Charles Sedley  died This circumstance set  me a thinking and ruminating upon the employments in which Men of wit exercise themselves It was said of Sir  Charles  who breath'd his last in this room  Sedley  has that prevailing gentle art  Which can with a resistless charm impart  The loosest wishes to the chastest heart  Raise such a conflict kindle such a fire  Between declining Virtue and Desire  Till the poor vanquish'd Maid dissolves away  In dreams all night in sighs and tears all day  This was an happy talent to a man of the Town but I dare say without presuming to make uncharitable conjectures on the author's present condition he would rather have had it said of him that he had pray'd  Oh thou my voice inspire  Who touch'd  Isaiah  's ballow'd lips with fire  I have turn'd to every verse and chapter and think you have preserv'd the sublime heavenly spirit throughout the whole especially at  Hark a glad voice  and  The lamb with wolves shall graze  There is but one line which I think below the original  He wipes the tears for ever from our eyes  You have express'd it with a good and pious but not with so exalted and poetical a spirit as the prophet  The Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces  If you agree with me in this alter it by way of paraphrase or otherwise that when it comes into a volume it may be amended Your Poem is already better than the  Pollio  I am  Your  c  Mr POPE to Mr STEELE  June  YOU have oblig'd me with a very kind letter by which I find you shift the seene of your life from the town to the country and enjoy that mix'd state which wise men both delight in and are qualify'd for Methinks the Moralists and Philosophers have generally run too much into extremes in commending intirely either solitude or publick life In the former men for the most part grow useless by too much rest and in the latter are destroy'd by too much precipitation as waters lying still putrify and are good for nothing and  running violently on do but the more mischief in their passage to others and are swallow'd up and lost the sooner themselves Those indeed who can be useful to all states should be like gentle streams that not only glide thro' lonely valleys and forests amidst the flocks and the shepherds but visit populous towns in their course and are at once of ornament and service to them But there are another sort of people who seem design'd for solitude such I mean as have more to hide than to show As for my own part I am one of those of whom  Seneca  says  Tam umbratiles sunt ut putent in turbido esse quicquid in luce est  Some men like some pictures are fitter for a corner than a full light and I believe such as have a natural bent to solitude to carry on the former similitude are like waters which may be forc'd into fountains and exalted into a great height may make a noble figure and a louder noise but after all they would run more smoothly quietly and plentifully in their own natural course upon the ground The consideration of this would  These foregoing Similitudes our Author had put into Verse some years before and inserted into Mr  Wycherleys  's Poem on  Mixt Life  We find him apparently in the Versification of them as they are since printed in  Wycherley  's eosthumous Works o  Page    d and    th  make me very well contented with the possession only of that Quiet which  Cowley  calls the  Companion of obscurity  But whoever has the Muses too for his companions can never be idle enough to be uneasy Thus Sir you see I would flatter myself into a good opinion of my own way of living  Plutarch  just now told me that 'tis in human life as in a game at tables where a man may wish for the highest cast but if his chance be otherwise he is even to play it as well as he can and to make the best of it I am  Your  c  Mr POPE to Mr STEELE  June  YOU formerly observ'd to me that nothing made a more ridiculous figure in a man's life than the disparity we often find in him sick and well Thus one of an unfortunate constitution is perpetually exhibiting a miserable example of the weakness of his mind and of his body in their turns I have had frequent opportunities of late to consider myself in these different views and I hope have receiv'd some  advantage by it if what Mr  Waller  says be true that  The soul's dark cottage batter'd and decay'd  Lets in new light thro' chinks that time has made  Then surely sickness contributing no less than old age to the shaking down this scaffolding of the body may discover the inward structure more plainly Sickness is a sort of early old age it teaches us a diffidence in our earthly state and inspires us with the thoughts of a future better than a thousand volumes of philosophers and divines It gives so warning a concussion to those props of our vanity our strength and youth that we think of fortifying ourselves within when there is so little dependance upon our outworks Youth at the very best is but a betrayer of human life in a gentler and smoother manner than age 'Tis like a stream that nourishes a plant upon a bank and causes it to flourish and blossom to the sight but at the same time is undermining it at the root in secret My youth has dealt more fairly and openly with me it has afforded several Prospects of my danger and given me an advantage not very common to young men that the attractions of the  world have nor dazzled me very much and I begin where most people end with a full conviction of the emptiness of all sorts of ambition and the unsatisfactory nature of all human pleasures When a smart fit of sickness tells me this scurvy tenement of my body will fall in a little time I am e'en as unconcern'd as was that honest  Hibernian  who being in bed in the great storm some years ago and told the house would tumble over his head made answer What care I for the house I am only a lodger I fancy 'tis the best time to die when one is in the best humour and so excessively weak as I now am I may say with conscience that I am not at all uneasy at the thought that many men whom I never had any esteem for are likely to enjoy this world after me When I reflect what an inconsiderable little atome every single man is with respect to the whole creation methinks 'tis a shame to be concern'd at the removal of such a trivial animal as I am The morning after my Exit the sun will rise as bright as ever the flowers smell as sweet the plants spring as green the world will proceed in its old course people will laugh as heartily and marry as fast as they were us'd to do The memory of man as it is elegantly express'd in the wisdom of  Solomon    passeth away as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but one day There are reasons enough in the fourth chapter of the same book to make any young man contented with the prospect of death  For honourable age is not that which standeth in length of time or is measured by number of years But wisdom is the gray hair to men and an unspotted life is old age He was taken away speedily lest wickedness should alter his understanding or deceit beguile his soul  c I am  Your  c  Mr POPE to Mr STEELE  Nov  I Was the other day in company with five or six men of some learning where chancing to mention the famous verses which the Emperor  Adrian  spoke on his deathbed they were all agreed that 'twas a piece of Gaiety unworthy of that Prince in those circumstances I could not but differ from this opinion Methinks it was by no means a gay but a very serious soliloquy to his soul at the point of his departure in which sense I naturally took  the verses at my first reading them when I was very young and before I knew what interpretation the world generally put upon them  Animula vagula blandula  Hospes comesque corporis  Quae nune abibis in loca  Pallidula rigida nudula  Nec ut soles dabis joca  "Alas my soul thou pleasing companion of this body thou fleeting thing that art now deserting it whither art thou flying to what unknown Scene all trembling fearful and pensive Now what is become of thy former wit and humour thou shalt jest and be gay no more"  I confess I cannot apprehend where lies the trifling in all this 'Tis the most natural and obvious reflection imaginable to a dying man and if we consider the Emperor was a heathen that doubt concerning the future fate of his soul will seem so far from being the effect of want of thought that 'twas scarce reasonable he should think otherwise not to mention that here is a plain confession included of his belief in its immortality The diminutive epithets of  vagula blandula  and the  rest appear not to me as expressions of levity but rather of endearment and concern such as we find in  Catullus  and the authors of  Hendecasyllabi  after him where they are used to express the utmost love and tenderness for their mistressesIf you think me right in my notion of the last words of  Adrian  be pleased to insert it in the  Spectator  if not to suppress it I am  Your  c  ADRIANI Morientis  AD ANIMAM  Translated  AH fleeting Spirit wand'ring Fire  That long hast warm'd my tender breast  Must thou no more this Frame inspire  No more a pleasing chearful Guest  Whither ah whither art thou flying  To what dark undiscover'd Shore  Thou seem'st all trembling shiv'ring dying  And Wit and Humour are no more  Mr STEELE to Mr POPE  Nov  I HAVE read over your  Temple of Fame  twice and cannot find any thing amiss of weight enough to call a fault but see in it a thousand thousand beauties Mr  Addison  shall see it to morrow After his perusal of it I will let you know his thoughts I desire you would let me know whether you are at leisure or not I have a design which I shall open a month or two hence with the assistance of the few like yourself If your thoughts are unengaged I shall explain myself further I am  Your  c  Mr POPE to Mr STEELE  Nov  YOU oblige me by the indulgence you have shewn the Poem I sent you but will oblige me much more by the kind severity I hope for from you No errors are so trivial but they deserve to be mended  but since you say you see nothing that may be call'd a fault can you but think it so that I have confined the attendance of  This is not now to be found in the  Temple of Fame  of which Poem he speaks here  Guardian spirits to Heaven's favourites only I could point you to several but 'tis my business to be informed of those faults I  do not  know and as for those  I do  not to talk of 'em but to correct 'em You speak of that Poem in a style I neither merit nor expect but I assure you if you freely mark or dash out I shall look upon your blots to be its greatest beauties I mean if Mr  Addison  and yourself shou'd like it in the whole otherwise the trouble of correction is what I would not take for I was really so diffident of it as to let it lie by me these  Hence it appears this Poem was wait before the Author was Years old  two years just as you now see it I am afraid of nothing so much as to impose any thing on the world which is unworthy of its acceptance  As to the last period of your letter I shall be very ready and glad to contribute to any design that tends to the advantage of mankind which I am sure all yours do I wish I had but as much capacity as leisure for I am perfectly idle a sign I have not much capacity  If you will entertain the best opinion of me be pleased to think me your friend Assure Mr  Addison  of my most faithful service of every one's esteem he must be assur'd already I am  Your  c  Mr POPE to Mr STEELE  Nov  I AM sorry you publish'd that notion about  Adrian  's  Verses  as mine shad I imagin'd you wou'd use my name I shou'd have express'd my sentiments with more modesty and diffidence I only sent it to have your opinion and not to publish my own which I distrusted But I think the supposition you draw from the notion of  Adrian  's being addicted to Magick is a little uncharitable  "that he might fear no sort of Deity good or bad"  since in the third verse he plainly testifies his apprehension of a future state by being sollicitous  whither  his soul was going As to what you mention of his using gay and ludicrous expressions I have owned my opinion to be that the expressions are not so but  that diminutives are often in the  Latin  tongue used as marks of tenderness and concern  Anima  is no more than my soul  Animula  has the force of my dear soul To say  Virgo Bella  is not half so endearing as  Virguncula Bellula  and had  Augustus  only call'd  Horace Lepidum Hominem  it had amounted to no more than that he thought him a pleasant fellow 'Twas the  Homunciolum  that exprest the love and tenderness that great Emperor had for him And perhaps I should myself be much better pleas'd if I were told you call'd me your little friend than if you complimented me with the Title of a great Genius or an Eminent hand as  Jacob  does all his authors I am  Your  c  Mr POPE to  Decemb  YOU have at length comply'd with the request I have often made you for you have shown me I must confess several of my faults in the sight of those letters Upon a review of them I find  many things that would give me shame if I were not more desirous to be thought honest than prudent so many things freely thrown out such lengths of unreserv'd friendship thoughts just warm from the brain without any polishing or dress the very dishabille of the understanding You have prov'd yourself more tender of another's embryo's than the fondest mothers are of their own for you have preserv'd every thing that I miscarry'd of Since I know this I shall in one respect be more afraid of writing to you than ever at this careless rate because I see my evil works may again rise in judgment against me Yet in another respect I shall be less afraid since this has given me such a proof of the extreme indulgence you afford to my slightest thoughts The revisal of these letters has been a kind of examination of conscience to me so fairly and faithfully have I set down in 'em from time to time the true and undistinguish'd state of my mind But I find that these which were intended as sketches of my friendship give as imperfect images of it as the little landscapes we commonly see in black and white do of a beautiful country they can represent but a very small part of it and that depriv'd of the life and lustre of nature I perceive that the more I endeavour'd  to render manifest the real affection and value I ever had for you I did but injure it by representing less and less of it as glasses which are design'd to make an object very clear generally contract it Yet as when people have a full idea of a thing first upon their own knowledge the least traces of it serve to refresh the remembrance and are not displeasing on that score So I hope the foreknowledge you had of my esteem for you is the reason that you do not dislike my letters  They will not be of any great service I find in the design I mentioned to you I believe I had better steal from a richer man and plunder your letters which I have kept as carefully as I would Letters Patents since they intitle me to what I more value than titles of honour You have some cause to apprehend this usage from me if what some say be true that I am a great Borrower however I have hitherto had the luck that none of my creditors have challeng'd me for it and those who say it are such whose writings no man ever borrow'd from so have the least reason to complain Their works are granted on all hands to be but too much their ownAnother has been pleased to declare that my Verses are corrected by  other men I verily believe theirs were never corrected by any man But indeed if mine have not 'twas not my fault I have endeavoured my utmost that they should But these things are only whispher'd and I will not encroach upon  Bays  's province and  pen Whispers  so hasten to conclude  Your  c  Sir WILLIAM TRUMBULL to Mr POPE  March  I Think a hasty scribble shows more what flows from the heart than a letter after  Balzac  's manner in studied phrases therefore I will tell you as fast as I can that I have received your favour of the th past with your kind present of  The Rape of the Lock  You have given me the truest satisfaction imaginable not only in making good the just opinion I have ever had of your reach of thought and my Idea of your comprehensive genius but likewise in that pleasure I take as an  Engglish  Man to see the  French  even  Boileau  himself in his  Lutrin  outdone in your Poem For you descend  leviore plectro  to all the nicer  touches that your own observation and wit furnish on such a subject as requires the finest strokes and the liveliest imagination But I must say no more tho' I could a great deal on what pleases me so much and henceforth I hope you will never condemn me of partiality since I only swim with the stream and approve what all men of good taste notwithstanding the jarring of Parties must and do universally applaud I now come to what is of vast moment I mean the preservation of your health and beg of you earnestly to get out of all Taverncompany and fly away  tanquam ex incendio  What a misery it is for you to be destroyed by the foolish kindness 'tis all one whether real or pretended of those who are able to bear the Poison of bad Wine and to engage you in so unequal a combat As to  Homer  by all I can learn your business is done therefore come away and take a little time to breathe in the country I beg now for my own sake but much more for yours methinks Mr  has said to you more than once  Heu fuge nate dea teque his ait eripe flammis  I am Your  c  Mr POPE to Sir WILLIAM TRUMBULL  March  THough any thing you write is sure to be a pleasure to me yet I must own your last letter made me uneasy You really use a style of compliment which I expect as little as I deserve it I know 'tis a common opinion that a young scribler is as ill pleas'd to hear truth of a young Lady From the moment one sets up for an author one must be treated as ceremoniously that it is as unfaithfully  As a King's Favourite or as a King  This proceeding join'd to that natural vanity which first makes a man an author is certainly enough to render him a coxcomb for life But I must grant it is but a just judgment upon Poets that they whose chief pretence is Wit shou'd be treated just as they themselves treat Fools that is be cajol'd with praises And I believe Poets are the only poor fellows in the world whom any body will flatter  I would not be thought to say this as if the obliging letter you sent me deserv'd this imputation only it put me in mind of it and I fancy one may apply to one's friend what  Caesar  said of his Wife  It was not sufficient that he knew her to be chast himself but she shou'd not be so much as suspected by others  As to the wonderful discoveries and all the good news you are pleas'd to tell me of myself I treat it as you who are in the Secret treat common news groundless reports of things at a distance which I who look into the true springs of the affair at home in my own breast know to have no foundation at all For  Fame  tho' it be as  Milton  finely calls it  The last Infirmity of noble Minds  is scarce so strong a temptation as to warrant our loss of time here It can never make us lie down contentedly on a deathbed as some of the ancients are said to have done with that thought You Sir have yourself taught me that an easy situation at that hour can proceed from no ambition less noble than that of an eternal felicity which is unattainable by the strongest endeavours of the Wit but may be gain'd by the sincere intentions of the Heart only As in the next world so in this the only solid blessings are owing to the goodness of the mind not the extent  of the capacity Friendship here is an emanation from the same source as Beatitude there the same benevolence and grateful disposition that qualifies us for the one if extended farther makes us partakers of the other The utmost point of my desires in my present state terminates in the society and goodwill of worthy men which I look upon as no ill earnest and foretaste of the society and alliance of happy souls hereafter  The continuance of your favours to me is what not only makes me happy but causes me to set some value upon myself as a part of your care The instances I daily meet with of these agreeable awakenings of friendship are of too pleasing a nature not to be acknowledged whenever I think of you I am  Your  c  To the same  April  I Have been almost every day employ'd in following your advice and amusing myself in Painting in which I am most particularly  obliged to Mr  Jervas  who gives me daily instructions and examples As to poetical affairs I am content at present to be a bare lookeron and from a practitioner turn an admirer which is as the world goes not very usual  Cato  was not so much the wonder of  Rome  in his days as he is of  Britain  in ours and tho' all the foolish industry possible has been used to make it thought a Partyplay yet what the author once said of another may the most properly in the world be apply'd to him on this occasion  Envy itself is dumb in wonder lost  And Factions strive who shall applaud him most  The numerous and violent claps of the Whigparty on the one side of the theatre were echo'd back by the Tories on the other while the Author sweated behind the scenes with concern to find their applause proceeding more from the hand than the head This was the case too of the Prologuewriter who was clapp'd into a stanch Whig at almost ev'ry two lines I believe you have heard that after all the applauses of the opposite Faction my Lord  Bolingbroke  sent for  Booth  who play'd  Cato  into the box  between one of the acts and presented him with fifty guineas in acknowledgment as he exprest it for defending the cause of  Liberty  so well against a  Perpetual Dictator  The Whigs are unwilling to be distanc'd this way as 'tis said and therefore design a present to the same  Cato  very speedily in the mean time they are getting ready as good a Sentence as the former on their side So betwixt them 'tis probable that  Cato  as Dr  Garth  exprest it  may have something to live upon after he dies  I am  Your  c  Mr POPE to Mr ADDISON  July  I AM more joy'd at your return than I should be at that of the Sun so much as I wish for him this melancholy wet season but 'tis his fate too like yours to be displeasing to Owls and obscene animals who cannot bear his lustre What put me in mind of these nightbirds was  John Dennis  whom I think you are best reveng'd upon as the Sun was in the fable  upon those batts and beastly birds abovemention'd only by  Shining on  I am so far from esteeming it any misfortune that I congratulate you upon having your share in that which all the great men and all the good men that ever liv'd have had their part of Envy and Calumny To be uncensur'd and to be obscure is the same thing You may conclude from what I here say that 'twas never in my thoughts to have offer'd you my pen in any direct reply to such a Critic but only in some little raillery not in defence of you but in contempt of him  This relates to the Paper occasion'd by  Dennis  's Remarks upon  Cato  call'd Dr  Norris  's  Narrative of the Frenzy of  John Den  But indeed your opinion that 'tis intirely to be neglected would have been my own had it been my own case but I felt more warmth here than I did when first I saw his book against myself tho' indeed in two minutes it made me heartily merry He has written against every thing the world has approv'd these many years I apprehend but one danger from  Dennis  's disliking our sense that it may make us think so very well of it as to become proud and conceited upon his disapprobation  I must not here omit to do justice to Mr  whose zeal in your concern is worthy a friend and honourer of you He writ to me in the most pressing terms about it tho' with that just contempt of the Critic that he deserves I think in these days one honest man is oblig'd to acquaint another who are his friends when so many mischievous insects are daily at work to make people of merit suspicious of each other that they may have the satisfaction of seeing them look'd upon no better than themselves I am  Your  c  Mr ADDISON to Mr POPE  October  I Was extreamly glad to receive a letter from you but more so upon reading the contents of it The  The Translation of the  Iliad  Work you mention will I dare say very sufficiently recommend itself when your name appears with the Proposals And if you think I can any way contribute to the forwarding of them  you cannot lay a greater obligation upon me than by employing me in such an office As I have an ambition of having it known that you are my Friend I shall be very proud of showing it by this or any other instance I question not but your Translation will enrich our Tongue and do Honour to our Country for I conclude of it already from those performances with which you have obliged the publick I would only have you consider how it may most turn to your advantage Excuse my impertinence in this particular which proceeds from my zeal for your ease and happiness The work wou'd cost you a great deal of time and unless you undertake it will I am afraid never be executed by any other at least I know none of this age that is equal to it besides yourself  I am at present wholly immersed in country business and begin to take delight in it I wish I might hope to see you here sometime and will not despair of it when you engage in a work that will require solitude and retirement I am  Your  c  Mr ADDISON to Mr POPE  Nov  I Have receiv'd your letter and am glad to find that you have laid so good a scheme for your great undertaking I question not but the Prose will require as much care as the Poetry but the variety will give your self some relief and more pleasure to your readers  You gave me leave once to take the liberty of a friend in advising you not to content your self with one half of the Nation for your Admirers when you might command them all If I might take the freedom to repeat it I would on this occasion I think you are very happy that you are out of the Fray and I hope all your undertakings will turn to the better account for it  You see how I presume on your friendship in taking all this freedom with you but I already fancy that we have lived many years together in an unreserved conversation and that we may do many more is the sincere wish of  Your  c  Mr POPE to Mr ADDISON  YOUR last is the more obliging as it hints at some little niceties in my conduct which your candor and affection prompt you to recommend to me and which so trivial as things of this nature seem are yet of no slight consequence to people whom every body talks of and every body as he pleases 'Tis a sort of Tax that attends an estate in  Parnassus  which is often rated much higher than in proportion to the small possession an author holds For indeed an author who is once come upon the town is enjoy'd without being thanked for the pleasure and sometimes illtreated by those very persons that first debauch'd him Yet to tell you the bottom of my heart I am no way displeas'd that I have offended the violent of all Parties already and at the same time I assure you conscientiously I feel not the least malevolence or resentment against any of those who misrepresent me or are dissatisfied with me This frame of mind is so easy that I am perfectly content with my condition  As I hope and would flatter myself that you know me and my thoughts so entirely as never to be mistaken in either so 'tis a pleasure to me that you guess'd so right in regard to the Author of that  Guardian  you mentioned But I am sorry to find it has taken air that I have some hand in those Papers because I write so very few as neither to deserve the credit of such a report with some people nor the disrepute of it with others An honest  Jacobite  spoke to me the sense or nonsense of the weak part of his Party very fairly that the good people took it ill of me that I writ with  Steele  tho' upon never so indifferent subjectsThis I know you will laugh at as well as I do yet I doubt not but many little calumniators and persons of sower dispositions will take occasion hence to bespatter me I confess I scorn narrow souls of all parties and if I renounce my reason in religious matters I'll hardly do it in any other  I can't imagine whence it comes to pass that the few  Guardians  I have written are so generally known for mine that in particular which you mention I never discovered to any man but the publisher till very lately yet almost every body I met told me of it  The true reason that Mr  Steele  laid down the Paper was a quarrel between him and  Jacob Tonson  He stood engaged to his bookseller in articles of penalty for all the  Guardians  and by desisting two days and altering the title of the paper to that of the  Englishman  was quit of his obligation these papers being printed by  Buckley  As to his taking a more Politick turn I cannot any way enter into that secret nor have I been let into it any more than into the rest of his politicks Tho' 'tis said he will take into these papers also several subjects of the politick kind as before But I assure you as to myself I have quite done with 'em for the future The little I have done and the great respect I bear Mr  Steele  as a Man of Wit has rendered me a suspected Whig to some of the Violent but as old  Dryden  said before me 'Tis not the Violent I design to please  I generally employ the mornings in painting with Mr  Jervas  See Mr  Pope  's Epistle to him in Verse writ about this time  and the evenings in the conversation of such as I think can most improve my mind of whatever Party or Denomination they are I ever must set the highest value upon men of truly great  that is honest Principles with equal capacities The best way I know of overcoming Calumny and Misconstruction is by a vigorous perseverance in every thing we know to be right and a total neglect of all that can ensue from it 'Tis partly from this maxim that I depend upon your friendship because I believe it will do justice to my intention in every thing and give me leave to tell you that as the world goes this is no small assurance I repose in you I am  Your  c  To the same  Dec  I Have been lying in wait for my own imagination this week and more and watching what thoughts came up in the whirl of the fancy that were worth communicating to you in a letter But I am at length convinc'd that my rambling head can produce nothing of that sort so I must e'en be contented with telling you the old story that I love you heartily I have often found by experience that nature  and truth tho' never so low or vulgar are yet pleasing when openly and artlessly represented it would be diverting to me to read the very letters of an infant could it write its innocent inconsistencies and tautologies just as it thought 'em This makes me hope a letter from me will not be unwelcome to you when I am conscious I write with more unreservedness than ever man wrote or perhaps talk'd to another I trust your good nature with the whole range of my follies and really love you so well that I would rather you should pardon me than esteem me since one is an act of goodness and benevolence the other a kind of constrained deference  You can't wonder my thoughts are scarce consistent when I tell you how they are distracted Ev'ry hour of my life my mind is strangely divided this minute perhaps I am above the stars with a thousand systems round about me looking forward into a vast Abyss and losing my whole comprehension in the boundless space of creation in dialogues with  W  and the Astronomers the next moment I am below all trifles groveling with  T  in the very center of nonsense Now I am recreated with the brisk sallies and quick turns of wit which Mr  Steele  in his liveliest  and freest humours darts about him and now levelling my application to the insignificant observations and quirks of  Grammar  of Mr  and  D  Good God What an incongruous animal is Man how unsettled is his best part his Soul and how changing and variable in his frame of Body The constancy of the one shook by every Notion the temperament of the other affected by every blast of wind What is man altogether but one mighty Inconsistency Sickness and Pain is the lot of one half of us Doubt and Fear the portion of the other What a bustle we make about passing our time when all our space is but a point What aims and ambitions are crowded into this little instant of our life which as  Shakespear  finely words it is  Rounded with a Sleep  Our whole extent of Being no more in the eyes of him who gave it than a scarce perceptible moment of duration Those animals whose circle of living is limited to three or four hours as the Naturalists assure us are yet as longlived and possess as wide a scene of action as man if we consider him with an eye to all Space and all Eternity Who knows what plots what atchievements a mite may perform in his kingdom of a grain of dust within his l  e of some minutes and of how much less  consideration than even this is the life of man in the sight of that God who is from Ever and for Ever  Who that thinks in this train but must see the world and its contemptible grandeurs lessen before him at every thought 'Tis enough to make one remain stupify'd in a poize of inaction void of all desires of all designs of all friendships  But we must return thro' our very condition of being to our narrow selves and those things that affect our selves our passions our interests flow in upon us and unphilosophize us into meer mortals For my part I never return so much into myself as when I think of you whose friendship is one of the best comforts I have for the insignificancy of myself I am  Your  c  To the same  Jan  YOur letter found me very busy in my grand undertaking to which I must wholly give myself up for some time unless when I snatch an hour to please myself with a distant conversation with you  and a few others by writing 'Tis no comfortable prospect to be reflecting that so long a siege as that of  Troy  lies upon my hands and the campagne above half over before I have made any progress Indeed the  Greek  fortification upon a nearer approach does not appear so formidable as it did and I am almost apt to flotter myself that  Homer  secretly seems inclined to a correspondence with me in letting me into a good part of his intentions There are indeed a sort of underling auxiliars to the difficulty of a work called Commentators and Critics who wou'd frighten many people by their number and bulk and perplex our progress under pretence of fortifying their author These lie very low in the trenches and ditches they themselves have digged encompassed with dirt of their own heaping up but I think there may be found a method of coming at the main works by a more speedy and gallant way than by mining under ground that is by using the Poetical Engines Wings and flying over their heads  While I am engag'd in the fight I find you are concern'd how I shall be paid and are sollicitous that I may not have the ill fate of many discarded Generals to be first envy'd and malign'd then perhaps prais'd and lastly neglected The former the  constant attendant upon all great and laudable enterprizes I have already experienc'd Some have said I am not a Master in the  Greek  who either are so themselves or are not If they are not they can't tell and if they are they can't without having catechized me But if they can read for I know some Critics can and others cannot there are fairly lying before them some specimens of my translation from this Author in the  Miscellanies  which they are heartily welcome to I have met with as much malignity another way some calling me a Tory because the heads of that party have been distinguishingly favourable to me some a Whig because I have been favoured with yours Mr  Congreve  's and Mr  Craggs  his friendship and of late with my Lord  Hallifax  's Patronage How much more natural a conclusion might be formed by any goodnatur'd man that a person who has been well used by all sides has been offensive to none This miserable age is so sunk between animosities of Party and those of Religion that I begin to fear most men have politicks enough to make thro' violence the best Scheme of Government a bad one and faith enough to hinder their own Salvation I hope for my own part never to have more of either than is consistent  with common justice and charity and always as much as becomes a christian and honest man Tho' I find it an unfortunate thing to be bred a  Papist  here where one is obnoxious to four parts in five as being so too much and to the fifth part as being so too little I shall yet be easy under both their mistakes and be what I more than seem to be for I suffer for it God is my witness that I no more envy you Protestants your places and possessions than I do our Priests their charity or learning I am ambitious of nothing but the good opinion of good men on both sides for I know that one virtue of a free spirit is more worth than all the virtues put together of all the narrowsoul'd people in the world I am  Your  c  The Reverend Dean BERKLEY to Mr POPE  Leghorne  May  AS I take Ingratitude to be a greater crime than Impertinence I chuse rather to run the risque of being thought guilty of the latter than not to return  you my thanks for a very agreeable entertainment you just now gave me I have accidentally met with your  Rape of the Lock here  having never seen it before Style Painting Judgment Spirit I had already admired in others of your Writings but in this I am charmed with the magic of your  Invention  with all those images allusions and inexplicable beauties which you raise so surprizingly and at the same time so naturally out of a trifle And yet I cannot say that I was more pleased with the reading of it than I am with the pretext it gives me to renew in your thoughts the remembrance of one who values no happiness beyond the friendship of men of wit learning and good nature  I remember to have heard you mention some halfformed design of coming to  Italy  What might we not expect from a Muse that sings so well in the bleak climate of  England  if she felt the same warm Sun and breath'd the same Air with  Virgil  and  Horace  There are here an incredible number of Poets that have all the inclination but want the genius or perhaps the art of the Ancients Some among them who understand  English  begin to relish our Authors and I am informed that at  Florence  they have translated  Milton  into  Italian  Verse If one who knows so well how to write like the old  Latin  Poets came among them it wou'd probably be a means to retrieve them from their cold trivial conceits to an imitation of their Predecessors  As Merchants Antiquaries Men of Pleasure  c  have all different views in travelling I know not whether it might not be worth a Poet's while to travel in order to store his mind with strong Images of Nature  Green fields and groves flow'ry meadows and purling streams are no where in such perfection as in  England  But if you wou'd know lightsome days warm suns and blue skies you must come to  Italy  and to enable a man to describe rocks and precipices it is absolutely necessary that he pass the  Alps  You will easily perceive that it is selfinterest makes me so fond of giving advice to one who has no need of it If you came into these parts I shou'd fly to see you I am here by the favour of my good friend the Dean of St  Patrick  's in quality of Chaplain to the Earl of  Peterborough  who about three months since left the greatest part of his family in this town God knows how long we shall stay here I am  Your  c  Mr POPE to the Honourable  June  THE Question you ask in relation to Mr  Ad  and  Philips  I shall answer in a few words Mr  Philips  did express himself with much indignation against me one evening at  Button  's Coffeehouse as I was told saying That I was entered into a Cabal with Dean  Swift  and others to write against the  WhigInterest  and in particular to undermine his own reputation and that of his friends  Steel  and  Addison  But Mr  Philips  never open'd his lips to my face on this or any like occasion tho' I was almost every night in the same room with him nor ever offer'd me any indecorum Mr  Addison  came to me a night or two after  Philips  had talk'd in this idle manner and assur'd me of his disbelief of what had been said of the friendship we shou'd always maintain and desir'd I wou'd say nothing further of it My Lord  Hallifax  did me the honour to stir in this matter by speaking to several people to obviate a false aspersion which might have done me no small prejudice with one Party However  Philips  did all  he could secretly to continue the report with the  Hanover  Club and kept in his hands the Subscriptions paid for me to him as Secretary to that Club The heads of it have since given him to understand that they take it ill but upon the terms I ought to be with a man whom I think a scoundrel I wou'd not even ask him for this money but commissioned one of the  Players  his equals to receive it This is the whole matter but as to the secret grounds of  Philips  's malignity they will make a very pleasant History when we meet Mr  Congreve  and some others have been much diverted with it and most of the Gentlemen of the  Hanover  Club have made it the subject of their ridicule on their Secretary It is to this management of  Philips  that the world owes Mr  Gay  's  Pastorals  The ingenious Author is extreamly your servant and would have comply'd with your kind invitation but that he is just now appointed Secretary to my Lord  Clarendon  in his Embassy to  Hanover  I am sensible of the zeal and friendship with which I am sure you will always defend your friend in his absence from all those little tales and calumnies which a Man of any genius or merit is born to I shall never complain while I am happy in such noble defenders and in such contemptible  opponents May their envy and ill nature ever increase to the glory and pleasure of those they wou'd injure may they represent me what they will as long as you think me what I am  Your  c  To the same  July  YOU mention the account I gave you some time ago of the things which  Philips  said in his foolishness but I can't tell from any thing in your Letter whether you receiv'd a long one from me about a fortnight since It was principally intended to thank you for the last obliging favour you did me and perhaps for that reason you pass it in silence I there launched into some account of my temporal affairs and intend now to give you some hints of my spiritual The conclusion of your Letter draws this upon you where you tell me you  pray'd  for me Your proceeding Sir is contrary to that of most other Friends who never talk of praying for a Man after they have done  him a service but only when they will do him none Nothing can be more kind than the hint you give me of the vanity of human Sciences which I assure you I am daily more and more convine'd of and indeed I have for some years past look'd upon all of 'em no better than amusements To make them the ultimate end of our pursuit is a miserable and short ambition which will drop from us at ev'ry little disappointments here and even in case of no disappointmentr here will infallibly desert us hereafter The utmost fame they are capable of bestowing is never worth the pains they cost us and the time they lose us If you attain the top of your desires that way all those who envy you will do you harm and of those who admire you few will do you good The unsuccessful writers are your declared enemies and probably the successful your secret ones For those hate not more to be excelled than these to be rivalled And at the upshot after a life of perpetual application to reflect that you have been doing nothing for yourself and that the same or less Industry might have gain'd you a Friendship that can never deceive or end a satisfaction which praise cannot bestow nor vanity feel and a glory which tho' in one respect like same not to be had 'till after death yet  shall be felt and enjoy'd to eternity These dear Sir are unfeignedly my sentiments whenever I think at all for half the things that employ our heads deserve not the name of thoughts they are only stronger dreams or impressions upon the imagination Our schemes of government our systems of philosophy our golden worlds of poetry are all but so many shadowy images and airy prospects which arise to us but so much the livelier and more frequent as we are more o'ercast with the darkness and disturb'd with the fumes of human vanity  The same thing that makes old men willing to leave this world makes me willing to leave poetry long habit and weariness of the same track  Homer  will work a cure upon me fifteen thousand verses are equivalent to fourscore years to make one old in Rhime And I shou'd be sorry and ashamed to go on jingling to the last step like a waggoner's horse in the same road and so leave my  Bells  to the next silly animal that will be proud of 'em That man makes a mean figure in the eyes of reason who is measuring syllables and coupling rhimes when he should be mending his own Soul and securing his own immortality If I had not this opinion I should be unworthy even of those small and limited parts  which God has given me and unworthy of the friendship of such a man as you I am  Your  c  To the same  July  I Have no better excuse to offer you that I have omitted a task naturally so pleasing to me as conversing upon paper with you but that my time and eyes have been wholly employ'd upon  Homer  whom I almost fear I shall find but one way of imitating which is in his blindness I am perpetually afflicted with headach's that very much affect my sight and indeed since my coming hither I have scarce passed an hour agreeably except that in which I read your letter I would seriously have you think you have no man who more truly knows to place a right value on your friendship than he who least deserves it on all other accounts than his due sense of it But let me tell you you can hardly guess what a task you undertake when you profess your self my friend there are some  Tories  who will take you for a  Whig  some  Whigs  who will take you for a  Tory  some  Protestants  who will esteem you a rank  Papist  and some  Papists  who will account you a  Heretick  I find by dear experience we live in an age where it is criminal to be moderate and where no one man can be allowed to be just to all men The notions of right and wrong are so far strain'd that perhaps to be in the right so very violently may be of worse consequence than to be easily and quietly in the wrong I really wish all men so well that I am satisfied but few can wish me so but if those few are such as tell me they do I am content for they are the best people I know While you believe me what I profess as to Religion I can bear any thing the Bigotted may say while Mr  Congreve  likes my poetry I can endure  Dennis  and a thousand more like him while the most honest and moral of each party think me no ill man I can easily support it tho' the most violent and mad of all parties rose up to throw dirt at me  I must expect an hundred attacks upon the publication of my  Homer  Whoever in our times would be a professor of learning above his fellows ought at the very first to enter the world with the constancy and resolution of a primitive Christian and be prepared to suffer all sorts of publick Persecution  It is certainly to be lamented that if any man does but endeavour to distinguish himself or gratify others by his studies he is immediately treated as a common enemy instead of being look'd upon as a common friend and assaulted as generally as if his whole design were to prejudice the State and ruin the publick I will venture to say no man ever rose to any degree of perfection in writing but thro' obstinacy and an inveterate resolution against the stream of mankind So that if the world has receiv'd any benefit from the labours of the Learned it was in its own despite For when first they essay their parts all people in general are prejudiced against new beginners and when they have got a little above contempt then some particular persons who were before unfortunate in their own attempts are sworn foes to them only because they succeedUpon the whole one may say of the best writers that they pay a severe fine for their fame which it is always in the power of the most worthless part of mankind to levy upon them when they please  I am  c  To Mr JERVAS  July  I Am just enter'd upon the old way of life again sleep and musing It is my employment to revive the old of past ages to the present as it is yours to transmit the young of the present to the future I am copying the great Master in one art with the same love and diligence with which the Painter hereafter will copy you in another  Thus I should begin my Epistle to you if it were a  Dedicatory  one But as it is a friendly letter you are to find nothing mentioned in your own praise but what only one in the world is witness to your particular goodnatur'd offices to me Whatever mankind in general would allow you that I am not to give you to your face and if I were to do it in your absence the world would tell me I am too partial to be permitted to pass any judgment of you  So you see me cut out from any thing but common acknowledgments or common discourse The first you wou'd take ill tho' I told you but half what I ought so in short the last only remains  And as for the last what can you expect from a man who has not talk'd these five days who is withdrawing his thoughts as far as he can from all the present world its customs and its manners to be fully possest and absorpt in the past When people talk of going to Church I think of Sacrifices and Libations when I see the parson I address him as  Chryses  priest of  Apollo  and instead of the Lord's Prayer I begin  God of the Silver Bow  c  While you in the world are concerned about the  Protestant  Succession I consider only how  Menelaus  may recover  Helen  and the  Trojan  war be put to a speedy conclusion I never inquire if the Queen be well or not but heartily wish to be at  Hector  's funeral The only things I regard in this life are whether my friends are well whether my Translation go well on whether  Dennis  be writing criticisms whether any body will answer him since I don't and whether  Lintott  be not yet broke  I am  c  To the same  August  I Thank you for your good offices which are numberless  Homer  advances so fast that he begins to look about for the ornaments he is to appear in like a modish modern author  Picture in the Front  With bays and wicked ryme upon't  I have the greatest proof in nature at present of the amusing power of Poetry for it takes me up so intirely that I scarce see what passes under my nose and hear nothing that is said about me To follow Poetry as one ought one must forget father and mother and cleave to it alone My  Rêverie  has been so deep that I have scarce had an interval to think myself uneasy in the want of your company I now and then just miss you as I step into bed this minute indeed I want extremely to see you the next I shall dream of nothing but the taking of  Troy  or the recovery of  Briseis  I fancy no friendship is so likely to prove lasting as ours because I am pretty sure there never was a friendship of so easy a nature We neither of us demand any mighty things from each other what Vanity we have expects its gratification from other people It is not I that am to tell you what an Artist you are nor is it you that are to tell me what a Poet I am but 'tis from the world abroad we hope piously hope to hear these things At home we follow our business when we have any and think and talk most of each other when we have none 'Tis not unlike the happy friendship of a stay'd man and his wife who are seldom so fond as to hinder the business of the house from going on all day or so indolent as not to find consolation in each other every evening Thus wellmeaning couples hold in amity to the last by not expecting too much from human nature while romantick friendships like violent loves begin with disquiets proceed to jealousies and conclude in animosities I have liv'd to see the fierce advancement the sudden turn and the abrupt period of three or four of these enormous friendships and am perfectly convinced of the truth of a Maxim we once agreed in That nothing hinders the constant agreement of people who live together  but meer vanity a secret insisting upon what they think their dignity or merit and an inward expectation of such an Overmeasure of deference and regard as answers to their own extravagant false scale and which no body can pay because none but themselves can tell exactly to what pitch it amounts  I am  c  Mr POPE to EDWARD BLOUNT  Esq  Aug  WHatever studies on the one hand or amusements on the other it shall be my fortune to fall into I shall be equally incapable of forgetting you in any of 'em The Task I undertook  The Translation of  Homer  's  Iliad  tho' of weight enough in itself has had a voluntary increase by the inlarging my design of the  Notes  and the necessity of consulting a number of books has carry'd me to  Oxford  But I fear thro' my Lord  Harcourt  's and Dr  Clark  's means I shall be more conversant with the pleasures and company of  the place than with the Books and Manuscripts of it  I find still more reason to complain of the negligence of the Geographers in their Maps of  old Greece  since I look'd upon two or three more noted names in the publick libraries here But with all the care I am capable of I have some cause to fear the Engraver will prejudice me in a few situations I have been forced to write to him in so high a style that were my epistle intercepted it would raise no small admiration in an ordinary man There is scarce an order in it of less importance than to remove such and such mountains alter the course of such and such rivers place a large city on such a coast and raze another in another country I have set bounds to the sea and said to the land  thus far shalt thou advance  and  no further  This relates to the Map of ancient  Greece  laid down by our Author in his observations on the second  Iliad  In the mean time I who talk and command at this rate am in danger of loosing my horse and stand in some fear of a country justice To disarm me indeed may be but prudential considering what armies I have at present on foot and in my service A hundred thousand  Grecians  are no contemptible body for all that I can tell they may be as formidable  as four thousand  Priests  and they seem proper forces to send against those in  Barcelona  That siege deserves as fine a poem as the  Iliad  and the machining part of poetry would be the juster in it as they say the inhabitants expect Angels from heaven to their assistance May I venture to say who am a  Papist  and to say to you who are a  Papist  that nothing is more astonishing to me than that people so greatly warm'd with a sense of Liberty should be capable of harbouring such weak Superstition and that so much bravery and so much folly can inhabit the same breasts  I could not but take a trip to  London  on the death of the  Queen  mov'd by the common curiosity of mankind who leave their own business to be looking upon other mens I thank God that as for myself I am below all the accidents of Statechanges by my circumstances and above them by my philosophy Common charity of man to man and universal good will to all are the points I have most at heart and I am sure those are not to be broken for the sake of any governors or government I am willing to hope the best and what I more wish than my own or any particular man's advancement is that this turn may put an end entirely to the divisions of  Whig  and  Tory  that the parties may love each other as  well as I love them both or at least hurt each other as little as I would either and that our own people may live as quietly as we shall certainly let theirs that is to say that want of  power  itself in us may not be a surer prevention of harm than want of  will  in them I am sure if all  Whigs  and all  Tories  had the spirit of one  RomanCatholick  that I know it would be well for all  RomanCatholicks  and if all  RomanCatholicks  had always had that spirit it had been well for all others and we had never been charged with so wicked a spirit as that of Persecution  I agree with you in my sentiment of the state of our nation since this change I find myself just in the same situation of mind you describe as your own heartily wishing the good that is the quiet of my country and hoping a total end of all the unhappy divisions of mankind by partyspirit which at best is but the madness of many for the gain of a few  I am  c  Mr JERVAS to Mr POPE  Aug  I Have a particular to tell you at this time which pleases me so much that you must expect a more than ordinary alacrity in every turn You know I cou'd keep you in suspense for twenty lines but I will tell you directly that Mr  Addison  and I have had a conversation that it would have been worth your while to have been plac'd behind the wainscot or behind some halflength Picture to have heard He assur'd me that he wou'd make use not only of his interest but of his art to do you some service he did not mean his Art of Poetry but his Art at Court and he is sensible that nothing can have a better air for himself than moving in your favour especially since insinuations were spread that he did not care you should prosper too much as a Poet He protests that it shall not be his fault if there is not the best intelligence in the world and the most hearty friendship  c  He owns he was afraid Dr  Swift  might have carry'd you too far among the enemy during the heat of the animosity but now  all is safe and you are escap'd even in his opinion I promis'd in your name like a good Godfather not that you should renounce the devil and all his works but that you would be delighted to find him your friend merely for his own sake therefore prepare yourself for some civilities  I have done  Homer  's head shadow'd and heighten'd carefully and I inclose the outline of the same size that you may determine whether you wou'd have it so large or reduc'd to make room for a feuillage or laurel round the oval or about the square of the Busto perhaps there is something more solemn in the Image itself if I can get it well performed  If I have been instrumenal in bringing you and Mr  Addison  together with all sincerity I value myself upon it as an acceptable piece of service to such a one as I know you to be  Your  c  Mr POPE's Answer  Aug  I Am just arriv'd from  Oxford  very well diverted and entertain'd thereall very honest fellowsmuch concern'd for  the Queen's death No panegyricks ready yet for the King  I admire your  Whigprinciples  of Resistance exceedingly in the spirit of the  Barcelonians  I join in your wish for them Mr  Addison  's verses on Liberty in his letter from  Italy  would be a good form of prayer in my opinion  O Liberty thou Goddess heavenly bright  c  What you mention'd of the friendly office you endeavour'd to do betwixt Mr  Addison  and me deserves acknowledgments on my part You thoroughly know my regard to his character and my propensity to testify it by all ways in my power You as thoroughly know the scandalous meanness of that proceeding which was used by  Philips  to make a man I so highly value suspect my dispositions toward him But as after all Mr  Addison  must be the judge in what regards himself and has seem'd to be no very just one to me so I must own to you I expect nothing but civility from him how much soever I wish for his friendship And as for any offices of real kindness or service which it is in his power to do me I should be ashamed to receive 'em from any man who had no better opinion of my morals than to think me a partyman nor of my temper than to believe me capable of maligning  or envying another's reputation as a Poet So I leave it to Time to convince him as to bo  h to shew him the shallow depths of those halfwitted creatures who misinform'd him and to prove that I am incapable of endeavouring to lessen a person whom I would be proud to imitate and therefore asham'd to flatter In a word Mr  Addison  is sure of my respect at all times and of my real friendship whenever he shall think fit to know me for what I am  For all that pass'd betwixt Dr  Swift  and me you know the whole without reserve of our correspondence The engagements I had to him were such as the actual services he had done me in relation to the subscription for  Homer  obliged me to I must have leave to be grateful to him and to any one who serves me let him be never so obnoxious to any party nor did the  Toryparty  ever put me to the hardship of asking this leave which is the greatest obligation I owe to it and I expect no greater from the  Whigparty  than the same libertyA curse on the word  Party  which I have been forced to use so often in this period I wish the present Reign may put an end to the distinction that there may be no other for the future than that of honest and knave fool and men of sense  these two sorts must always be enemies but for the rest may all People do as you and I believe what they please and be friends  I am  c  Mr POPE to Mr ADDISON  October  I Have been acquainted by one of my friends who omits no opportunities of gratifying me that you have lately been pleas'd to speak of me in a manner which nothing but the real respect I have for you can deserve May I hope that some late malevolencies have lost their effect Indeed it is neither for me nor my enemies to pretend to tell you whether I am your friend or not but if you would judge by probabilities I beg to know which of your poetical acquaintance has so little Interest in pretending to be so Methinks no man should question the real friendship of one who desires no real service I am only to get as much from the  Whigs  as I got by the  Tories  that is to say Civility being neither so proud as to be insensible of any good office nor so humble as  not to dare heartily to despise any man who does me an injustice  I will not value myself upon having ever guarded all the degrees of respect for you for to say the truth all the world speaks well of you and I should be under a necessity of doing the same whether I cared for you or not  As to what you have said of me I shall never believe that the Author of  Cato  can speak one thing and think another As a proof that I account you sincere I beg a favour of you It is that you would look over the two first books of my translation of  Homer  which are now in the hands of my Lord  Halifax  I am sensible how much the reputation of any poetical work will depend upon the character you give it 'tis therefore some evidence of the trust I repose in your good will when I give you this opportunity of speaking ill of me with justice and yet expect you will tell me your truest thoughts at the same time that you tell others your most favourable ones  I have a farther request which I must press with earnestness My Bookseller is reprinting the  Essay on Criticism  to which you have done too much honour in your  Spectator  of N  o  The period in that paper where you say  "I have admitted some strokes of ill nature into that  Essay  "  is the only one I could wish omitted of all you have written but I wou'd not desire it should be so unless I had the merit of removing your objection I beg you but to point out those strokes to me and you may be assured they shall be treated without mercy  Since we are upon proofs of sincerity which I am pretty confident will turn to the advantage of us both in each other's opinion give me leave to name another passage in the same  Spectator  which I wish you would alter It is where you mention an observation upon  Homer  's Verses of  Sysiphus  's Stone  These Words are since lest out in Mr  Tickel  's Edition but were extant in all during Mr  Addison  's Life  never having been made before by any of the Criticks  I happen'd to find the same in  Dyonisius  of  Halicarnassus  's Treatise  who treats very largely upon these Verses I know you will think fit to soften your Expression when you see the passage which you must needs have read tho it be since slipt out of your memory I am with the utmost esteem  Your  c  Mr POPE to the Earl of HALIFAX  Dec  My LORD  I Am obliged to you both for the favours you have done me and for those you intend me I distrust neither your will nor your memory when it is to do good and if ever I become troublesome or sollicitous it must not be out of expectation but out of gratitude Your Lordship may either cause me to live agreeably in the town or contentedly in the country which is really all the difference I set between an easy fortune and a small one It is indeed a high strain of generosity in you to think of making me easy all my life only because I have been so happy as to divert you some few hours But if I may have leave to add it is because you think me no enemy to my native country there will appear a better reason for I must of consequence be very much as I sincerely am  My Lord  c  portrait of William Congreve  M  r  William Congreve  M V  dr  Gucht Sculp  Mr POPE to Mr CONGREVE  Jan  MEthinks when I write to you I am making a confession I have got I can't tell how such a custom of throwing myself out upon paper without reserve You were not mistaken in what you judg'd of my temper of mind when I writ last My faults will not be hid from you and perhaps it is no dispraise to me that they will not The cleanness and purity of one's mind is never better prov'd than in discovering its own faults at first view as when a Stream shows the dirt at its bottom it shows also the transparency of the water  My spleen was not occasioned however by any thing an  Dennis  who writ an abusive Pamphlet this Year intitled  Remarks on Mr  Pope  's  Homer  abusive angry Critick could write of me I take very kindly your heroick manner of congratulation upon this scandal for I think nothing more honourable than to be involved in the same fate with all the great  and the good that ever lived that is to be envy'd and censur'd by bad writers  You do no more than answer my expectations of you in declaring how well you take my freedom in sometimes neglecting as I do to reply to your Letters so soon as I ought those who have a right taste of the substantial part of friendship can wave the ceremonial A friend is the only one that will bear the omission and one may find who is not so by the very trial of it  As to any anxiety I have concerning the fate of my  Homer  the care is over with me The world must be the judge and I shall be the first to consent to the justice of its judgment whatever it be I am not so arrant an Author as even to desire that if I am in the wrong all mankind should be so  I am mightily pleas'd with a saying of Monsieur  Tourreil  "When a Man writes he ought to animate himself with the thoughts of pleasing all the world but he is to renounce that desire or hope the very moment the Book goes out of his hands"  I write this from  Binfield  whither I came yesterday having past a few days in my way with my Lord  Bolingbroke  I go to  London  in three days time and will not fail to pay a visit to Mr  M    whom I saw not long since at my Lord  Halifax  's I hoped from  thence he had some hopes of advantage from the present administration for few people I think but I pay respects to great Men without any prospects I am in the fairest way in the world of being not worth a groat being born both a  Papist  and a  Poet  This puts me in mind of reacknowledging your continued endeavours to enrich me But I can tell you 'tis to no purpose for without the  Opes Aequum animum mi ipse parabo  I am your  c  Mr POPE to Mr CONGREVE  March  THE Farce of the  Whatd'yecall it  has occasioned many different speculations in the town Some look'd upon it as meer jest upon the tragic poets others as a satire upon the late war Mr  Cromwell  hearing none of the words and seeing the action to be tragical was much astonished to find the audience laugh and says the Prince and Princess must doubtless be under no less amazement on the same account Several templers and others of the more vociferous kind of criticks went with a resolution to hiss and confest they were forced to laugh so much that they forgot the design they came with The Court in general has in a  very particular manner come into the jest and the three first Nights notwithstanding two of them were courtnights were distinguish'd by very full audiences of the first quality The common people of the pit and gallery receiv'd it at first with great gravity and sedateness some few with tears but after the third day they also took the hint and have ever since been very loud in their claps There are still some sober men who cannot be of the general opinion but the laughers are so much the majority that one or two criticks seem determin'd to undeceive the town at their proper cost by writing grave dissertations against it To encourage them in which laudable design it is resolv'd a  Preface  shall be prefixt to the  Farce  in vindication of the nature and dignity of this new way of writing  Yesterday Mr  Steele  's affair was decided I am sorry I can be of no other opinion than yours as to his whole carriage and writings of late But certainly he has not only been punish'd by others but suffer'd much even from his own party in the point of character nor I believe receiv'd any amends in that of interest as yet whatever may be his Prospects for the future  This Gentleman among a thousand others is a great instance of the fate of all who are carried away by partyspirit of any side I wish all violence may succeed  as ill but am really amazed that so much of that sower and pernicious quality shou'd be joined with so much natural good humour as I think Mr  Steele  is possess'd of  I am  c  To Mr CONGREVE  April  MR  Pope  is going to Mr  Jervas  's where Mr  Addison  is sitting for his picture in the mean time amidst clouds of tobacco at a coffeehouse I write this letter There is a grand revolution at  Will  's  Morrice  has quitted for a coffeehouse in the city and  Titcomb  is restor'd to the great joy of  Cromwell  who was at a great loss for a person to converse with upon the fathers and churchhistory the knowledge I gain from him is intirely in painting and poetry and Mr  Pope  owes all his skill in astronomy to him and Mr  Whiston  so celebrated of late for his discovery of the longitude in an extraordinary copy of Verses  Called  An Ode on the Longitude  in  Swift  's and  Pope  's Miscellanies  Mr  Rowe  's  Jane Gray  is to be play'd in  EasterWeek  when Mrs  Oldfield  is to personate a character directly opposite to female nature for what woman ever despis'd Sovereignty You know  Chaucer  has a tale where a knight  saves his head by discovering it was the thing which all women most covered Mr  Pope  's  Homer  is retarded by the great rains that have fallen of late which causes the sheets to be long a drying this gives Mr  Lintot  great uneasiness who is now endeavouring to corrupt the Curate of his parish to pray for fair weather that his work may go on There is a sixpenny  Criticism  lately publish'd upon the Tragedy of the  Whatd'yecallit  wherein he with much judgment and learning calls me a blockhead and Mr  Pope  a knave His grand charge is against the  Pilgrims Progress  being read which he says is directly level'd at  Cato  's reading Plato to back his censure he goes on to tell you that the  Pilgrims Progress  being mentioned to be the eighth edition makes the reflection evident the Tragedy of  Cato  having just eight times as he quaintly expresses it  visitéd the Press  He has also endeavoured to show that every particular passage of the play alludes to some fine part of Tragedy which he says I have injudiciously and profanely abused  This curious Piece was entitled  A compleat Key to the whatd'yecallit  It was written by one  Griffin  a Player assisted by  Lewis Theobald  Sir  Samuel Garth  's Poem upon my Lord  Clare  's house I believe will be publish'd in the  Easterweek  Thus far Mr  Gay  who has in his letter forestall'd all the subjects of diversion unless  it shou'd be one to you to say that I sit up till two aclock over  Burgundy  and  Champagne  and am become so much a rake that I shall be ashamed in a short time to be thought to do any sort of business I fear I must get the gout by drinking purely for a fashionable pretence to sit still long enough to translate four books of  Homer  I hope you'll by that time be up again and I may succeed to the bed and couch of my predecessor Pray cause the stuffing to be repaired and the crutches shortened for me The calamity of your gout is what all your friends that is to say all that know you must share in we desire you in your turn to condole with us who are under a persecution and much afflicted with a distemper which proves grievous to many poets a  Criticism  We have indeed some relieving intervals of laughter as you know there are in some diseases and it is the opinion of divers good guessers that the last fit will not be more violent than advantageous for poets assail'd by critics are like men bitten by  Tarantula's  they dance on so much the faster  Mr  Thomas Burnet  hath play'd the precursor to the coming of  Homer  in a treatise called  Homerides  He has since risen very much in his criticisms and after assaulting  Homer  made a daring attack upon  the  In one of his Papers call'd  The Grumbler  long since dead  Whatd'yecallit  Yet is there not a proclamation issued for the burning of  Homer  and the  Pope  by the common hangman nor is the  What d'ye callit  yet silenc'd by the Lord Chamberlain They shall survive the conflagration of his father's works and live after they and he are damned for that the B  p of  S  already is so is the opinion of Dr  Sacheverel  and the Church of  Rome    I am  c  Mr POPE to the Earl of  B    My LORD  IF your Mare could speak she wou'd give you an account of the extraordinary company she had on the road which since she cannot do I will  It was the enterprizing Mr  Lintott  the redoubtable rival of Mr  Tonson  who mounted on a stonehorse no disagreeable companion to your Lordship's mare overtook me in  Windsorforest  He said he heard I design'd for  Oxford  the seat of the muses and would as my bookseller by all means accompany me thither  I ask'd him where he got his horse He answered he got it of his publisher  "For that rogue my printer said he disappointed  me I hoped to put him in good humour by a treat at the tavern of a brown fricassee of rabbits which cost two shillings with two quarts of wine besides my conversation I thought myself cocksure of his horse which he readily promised me but said that Mr  Tonson  had just such another design of going to  Cambridge  expecting there the copy of  a Comment upon the Revelations  and if Mr  Tonson  went he was preingaged to attend him being to have the printing of the said copy"  So in short I borrow'd this stonehorse of my publisher which he had of Mr  Oldmixon  for a debt he lent me too the pretty boy you see after me he was a smutty dog yesterday and cost me near two hours to wash the ink off his face but the Devil is a faircondition'd Devil and very forward in his catechise if you have any more bags he shall carry them  I thought Mr  Lintott  's civility not to be neglected so gave the boy a small bagg containing three shirts and an Elvezir  Virgil  and mounting in an instant proceeded on the road with my man before my courteous stationer beside and the aforesaid Devil behind  Mr  Lintott  began in this manner  "Now damn them what if they should put it into the newspaper how you and I went  together to  Oxford  why what would I care If I should go down into  Sussex  they would say I was gone to the speaker But what of that if my son were but big enough to go on with the business by G  d I would keep as good company as old  Jacob  "  Hereupon I enquir'd of his son  "The lad says he has fine parts but is somewhat sickly  much as you are  I spare for nothing in his education at  Westminster  Pray don't you think  Westminster  to be the best school in  England  most of the  late Ministry  came out of it so did many of  this Ministry  I hope the boy will make his fortune"  Don't you design to let him pass a year at  Oxford  "To what purpose said he the Universities do but make Pedants and I intend to breed him a man of Business"  As Mr  Lintott  was talking I observ'd he sate uneasy on his saddle for which I express'd some solicitude Nothing says he I can bear it well enough but since we have the day before us methinks it would be very pleasant for you to rest a while under the Woods When we were alighted  "See here what a mighty pretty  Horace  I have in my pocket what if you amus'd yourself in turning an Ode till we mount again Lord if you pleas'd what a  clever  Miscellany  might you make at leisure hours"  Perhaps I may said I if we ride on the motion is an aid to my fancy a round trot very much awakens my spirits Then jog on apace and I'll think as hard as I can  Silence ensu'd for a full hour after which Mr  Lintott  lugg'd the reins stept short and broke out  "Well Sir how far have you gone"  I answered seven miles  "Z  ds Sir said  Lintott  I thought you had done seven stanza's  Oldsworth  in a ramble round  Wimbletonhill  would translate a whole Ode in half this time I'll say that for  Oldsworth  tho' I lost by his  Timothy  's he translates an Ode of  Horace  the  quickest  of any man in  England  I remember Dr  King  would write verses in a tavern three hours after he could n't speak and there's Sir  Richard  in that rumbling old Chariot of his between  Fleetditch  and St  Giles  's pound shall make you half a  Job  "  Pray Mr  Lintott  said I now you talk of Translators what is your method of managing them  "Sir reply'd he those are the saddest pack of rogues in the world In a hungry fit they'll swear they understand all the languages in the universe I have known one of them take down a  Greek  book upon my counter and cry Ay this is  Hebrew  I must read it from the  latter end By G  d I can never be sure in these fellows for I neither understand  Greek Latin French  nor  Italian  myself But this is my way I agree with them for ten shillings  per  sheet with a proviso that I will have their doings corrected by whom I please so by one or other they are led at last to the true sense of an author my judgment giving the negative to all my Translators"  But how are you secure that those correctors may not impose upon you  "Why I get any civil gentleman especially any  Scotchman  that comes into my shop to read the original to me in  English  by this I know whether my first Translator be deficient and whether my Corrector merits his money or no"  "I'll tell you what happened to me last month I bargain'd with  S  for a new version of  Lucretius  to publish against  Tonson  's agreeing to pay the author so many shillings at his producing so many lines He made a great progress in a very short time and I gave it to the corrector to compare with the  Latin  but he went directly to  Creech  's translation and found it the same word for word all but the first page Now what d'ye think I did I arrested the  Translator  for a cheat nay and I stopt the  Corrector  's  pay  too upon this proof that he had made use of  Creech  instead of the original"  Pray tell me next how you deal with the Critics  "Sir said he nothing more easy I can silence the most formidable of them the rich ones for a sheet a piece of the blotted manuscript which costs me nothing They'll go about with it to their acquaintance and pretend they had it from the author who submitted to their correction this has given some of them such an air that in time they come to be consulted with and dedicated too as the top critics of the townAs for the poor Critics I'll give you one instance of my management by which you may guess at the rest A lean man that look'd like a good scholar came to me t'other day he turn'd over  Homer  shook his head shrugg'd up his shoulders and pish'd at every line of it  One would wonder  says he  at the strange presumption of men  Homer  is no such easy task that  every  Stripling  every  Versisier  he was going on when my Wife called to dinner Sir said I will you please to eat a  piece of beef  with me Mr  Lintott  said he  I am sorry you should be at the expence of this great book I am really concern'd on your account  Sir I am much oblig'd to you if you can dine upon a piece of beef together with a slice of pudding  Mr  Lintott  I do not say but Mr  Pope  if he would condescend to advise with men of learning  Sir the  pudding  is upon the table if you please to go inMy critic complies he comes to a taste of your poetry and tells me in the same breath that the  Book  is commendable and the  Pudding  excellent"  Now Sir concluded Mr  Lintott  in return to the frankness I have shown pray tell me  "Is it the opinion of your friends at Court that my Lord  L  will be brought to the Bar or not"  I told him I heard  not  and I hoped it my Lord being one I had particular obligations to  "That may be reply'd Mr  Lintott  but by G  d if he is not I shall lose the printing of a very good Trial"  These my Lord are a few traits by which you may discern the genius of my friend Mr  Lintott  which I have chosen for the subject of a letter I dropt him as soon as I got to  Oxford  and paid a visit to my Lord  Carlton  at  Middleton  The conversations I enjoy here are not to be prejudiced by my pen and the pleasures from them only to be equal'd when I meet your Lordship I hope in a few days to cast myself from your horse at your feet  I am  c  Dr PARNELLE to Mr POPE  Jun  I Am writing you a long letter but all the tediousness I feel in it is that it makes me during the time think more intently of my being far from you I fancy if I were with you I cou'd remove some of the uneasiness which you may have felt from the opposition of the world and which you should be ashamed to feel since it is but the testimony which one part of it gives you that your merit is unquestionable What wou'd you have otherwise from ignorance envy or those tempers which vie with you in your own way I know this in mankind that when our ambition is unable to attain its end it is not only wearied but exasperated too at the vanity of its labours then we speak ill of happier studies and sighing condemn the excellence which we find above our reach  My  Printed for  B Lintott    o  under this Title  Zoilus  which you us'd to write about I finished last spring and left in town I waited till I came up to send it you but not arriving here before your book was out  imagin'd it a lost piece of labour If you will still have it you need only write me word  I have here seen the  First Book  of  Homer  which came out at a time when it cou'd not but appear as a kind of setting up against you My opinion is that you may if you please give  them thanks who writ it  Neither the numbers nor the spirit have an equal mastery with yours but what surprizes me more is that a scholar being concern'd there should happen to be some mistakes in the author's sense such as putting the light of  Pallas  's eyes into the eyes of  Achilles  making the taunt of  Achilles  to  Agamemnon  that he should have spoils when  Troy  should be taken to be a cool and serious proposal the translating what you call  ablution  by the word  Offals  and so leaving  Water  out of the rite of Lustration  c  but you must have taken notice of all this before I write not to inform you but to shew I always have you at heart  I am  c  From a Letter of the Reverend Doctor BERKLEY Dean of  Londonderry  July  Some days ago three or four Gentlemen and myself exerting that right which  all readers pretend to over Authors sate in judgment upon the two new Translations of the first  Iliad  Without partiality to my countrymen I assure you they all gave the preference where it was due being unanimously of opinion that yours was equally just to the sense with Mr  's and without comparison more easy more poetical and more sublime But I will say no more on such a threadbare subject as your late performance is at this time  I am  c  Extract from a Letter from Mr GAY to Mr POPE  July  I have just set down Sir  Samuel Garth  at the Opera He bid me tell you that every body is pleas'd with your Translation but a few at  Button  's and that Sir  Richard Steele  told him that Mr  Addison  said  Tickel  's translation was the best that ever was in any language  Sir  Richard Steele  afterwards in his Preface to an Edition of the  Drummer  a Comedy by Mr  Addison  shews it to be his opinion that  "  not Mr  Tickel  but Mr  Addison  himself was the Person that translated this book  "  He treated me with extream civility and out of kindness gave me a  squeeze by the Sore fingerI am inform'd that at  Button  's your character is made very free with as to morals  c  and Mr  A  says that your translation and  Tickel  's are both very well done but that the latter has more of  Homer  I am  c  Extract from a Letter of Dr ARBUTHNOT to Mr POPE  July  I congratulate you upon Mr  Tickel  's first Book It does not indeed want its merit but I was strangely disappointed in my expectation of a Translation nicely true to the original whereas in those parts where the greatest exactness seems to be demanded he has been the least careful I mean the History of  ancient Ceremonies and Rites  c in which you have with great judgment been exact  I am  c  Mr POPE to the Honourable JAMES CRAGGS  Esq  July  I Lay hold of the opportunity given me by my Lord Duke of  Shrewsbury  to  assure you of the continuance of that esteem and affection I have long borne you and the memory of so many agreeable conversations as we have passed together I wish it were a compliment to say such conversations as are not to be found on this side of the Water for the spirit of Dissension is gone forth among us nor is it a wonder that  Button  's is no longer  Button  's when  Old England  is no longer  Old England  that region of hospitality society and good humour Party affects us all even the wits tho' they gain as little by politicks as they do by their wit We talk much of fine sense refined sense and exalted sense but for use and happiness give me a little common sense I say this in regard to some gentlemen professed wits of our acquaintance who fancy they can make Poetry of consequence at this time of day in the midst of this raging fit of Politicks For they tell me the busy part of the nation are not more divided about  Whig  and  Tory  than these idle fellows of the Feather about Mr  Tickel  's and my Translation I like the  Tories  have the town in general that is the mob on my side but 'tis usual with the smaller Party to make up in industry what they want in number and that's the case with the little Senate of  Cato  However if our principles be well considered I  must appear a brave  Whig  and Mr  Tickel  a rank  Tory  I translated  Homer  for the publick in general he to gratify the inordinate desires of One man only We have it seems a great  Turk  in Poetry who can never bear a Brother on the throne and has his Mutes too a sett of Nodders Winkers and Whisperers whose business is to strangle all other offsprings of wit in their birth The new Translator of  Homer  is the humblest slave he has that is to say his first Minister let him receive the honours he gives him but receive them with fear and trembling let him be proud of the approbation of his absolute Lord I appeal to the People as my rightful judges and masters and if they are not inclined to condemn me I fear no arbitrary highflying proceedings from the small Courtfaction at  Button  's But after all I have said of this great Man there is no rupture between us We are each of us so civil and obliging that neither thinks he is obliged And I for my part treat with him as we do with the  Grand Monarch  who has too many great qualities not to be respected tho' we know he watches any occasion to oppress us  When I talk of  Homer  I must not forget the early present you made me of  Monsieur de la Motte  's Book And I can't conclude  this letter without telling you a melancholy piece of news which affects our very Entrailsis dead and Soupes are no more You see I write in the old familiar way  "This is not to the Minister but to the Friend"  However it is some mark of uncommon regard to the Minister that I steal an expression from a Secretary of State  I am  c  Mr POPE to Sir WILLIAM TRUMBULL  Dec  IT was one of the Enigma's of  Pythagoras When the Winds rise worship the Echo  A modern Writer explains this to signify  "  When popular Tumults begin retire to Solitudes or such places where Echo's are commonly found Rocks Woods  c"  I am rather of opinion it should be interpreted  "When Rumours increase and when there is abundance of Noise and Clamour believe the  second Report  "  This I think agrees more exactly with the  Echo  and is the more natural application of the Symbol  However it be either of these precepts is extreamly proper to be followed at this season and I cannot but applaud your resolution of continuing in what you call your Cave in the forest this winter and preferring the noise of breaking Ice to that of breaking Statesmen the rage of Storms to that of Parties and fury and ravage of Floods and Tempests to the precipitancy of some and the ruins of others which I fear will be our daily prospect in  London  I sincerely wish myself with you to contemplate the wonders of God in the firmament rather than the madness of men on the earth But I never had so much cause as now to complain of my poetical star that fixes me at this tumultuous time to attend the gingling of rhymes and the measuring of syllables To be almost the only trifler in the nation and as ridiculous as the Poet in  Petronius  who while all the rest in the ship were either labouring or praying for life was scratching his head in a little room to write a fine description of the tempest  You tell me you like the sound of no arms but those of  Achilles  for my part I like them as little as the others I listed myself in the battles of  Homer  and I am no sooner in war but like most other folks I wish myself out again  I heartily join with you in wishing Quiet to our native country Quiet in the state which like charity in religion is too much the perfection and happiness of either to be broken or violated on any pretence or prospect whatsoever Fire and sword and fire and faggot are equally my aversion I can pray for opposite parties and for opposite religions with great sincerity I think to be a lover of one's Country is a glorious Elogy but I do not think it so great an one as to be a lover of Mankind  Mr  J  and I sometimes celebrate you under these denominations and join your health with that of the whole world a truly Catholick health which far excels the poor narrowspirited ridiculous healths now in fashion to  this Church  or  that Church  Whatever our teachers may say they must give us leave at least to  wish  generously These dear Sir are my general dispositions but whenever I pray or wish for particulars you are one of the first in the thoughts and affections of  Your  c  Sir W TRUMBULL's Answer  Jan  I Should be asham'd of my long idleness in not acknowledging your kind advice about  Echo  and your most ingenious explanation of it relating to Popular tumults which I own to be very useful and yet give me leave to tell you that I keep myself to a shorter receipt of the same  Pythagoras  which is  Silence  and this I shall observe if not the whole time of his discipline yet at least till Your return into this country I am oblig'd further to this method by the most severe weather I ever felt when tho' I keep as near by the fire as may be yet  gelidus concrevit frigore Sanguis  and often I apprehend the circulation of the blood begins to be stop'd I have further great losses to a poor farmer of my poor Oxen  Intereunt pecudes slant circumfusa pruinis Corpora Magna Boum  c  Pray comfort me if you can by telling me that your second Volume of  Homer  is not frozen for it must be express'd very poetically to say now that the Presses  sweat  I cannot forbear to add a piece of artifice I have been guilty of on occasion of my being obliged to congratulate the birthday of a friend of mine When finding I had no materials of my own I very frankly sent him your imitation of  Martial  's Epigram on  Antonius Primus  Jam numerat placido felix Antonius aevo  c  Sir  William Trumbull  was born at  Easthamsted  in  Berkshire  He was Fellow of  All Souls  College in  Oxford  follow'd the Study of the Civil Law and was sent by King  Charles  the Second JudgeAdvocate to  Tangier  thence Envoy to  Florence Turin  c and in his way back Envoy Extraordinary to  France  from thence sent by King  James  the Second Ambassador to the  Ottoman Porte  Afterwards he was made Lord of the Treasury then Secretary of State with the Duke of  Shrewsbury  which Office he resign'd in He retir'd to  Easthamsted  in  Windsor Forest  and died in the Place of his Nativity in  December  aged Bears Our Author celebrated that Retirement in his Poem on the Forest and addrest to him his first Pastoral at Years of Age  This has been applauded so much that I am in danger of commencing Poet perhaps Laureat pray desire my good friend Mr  Rowe  to enter a Caveat provided you will further increase my stock in this bank In which proceeding I have laid the foundation of my estate and as  honestly  as many others have begun theirs But now being a little tender as young beginners often are I offer to you for I have concealed the true author whether you will give me orders to declare who is the Father of this fine child or not Whatever you determine my fingers pen and ink are so frozen that I cannot thank you more at large You will forgive this and all other faults of  Dear Sir  Your  c  To Mr JERVAS in  Ireland  July  THO' as you rightly remark I pay my Tax but once in half a Year yet you shall see by this Letter upon the neck of my last that I pay a double Tax as we NonJurors ought to do Your Acquaintance on this side the Sea are under terrible Apprehensions from your long stay in  Ireland  that you may grow too Polite for them for we think since the great success of so damn'd a Play as the NonJuror that Politeness is gone over the Water But others are of opinion it has been longer among you and was introduced much about the same time with  Frogs  and with equal Success Poor  Poetry  the little that's left of it here longs to cross the Seas and leave  Eusden  in full and peaceable Possession of the  British  Laurel  And we begin to wish you had the singing of our Poets as well as the croaking of our Frogs to yourselves in  Saecula Saeculorum  It would be well in exchange if  Parnelle  and two or three more of your Swans would come hither especially that Swan who like a true modern one does not sing at all Dr  Swift  I am like the rest of the World a Sufferer by his Idleness Indeed I hate that any Man should be idle while I must translate and comment And I may the more sincerely wish for good Poetry from others because I am become a person out of the question for a Translator is no more a Poet than a Taylor is a Man  You are doubtless persuaded of the Validity of that famous Verse  'Tis Expectation makes a Blessing dear  but why would you make your Friends fonder of you than they are There's no manner of need of itWe begin to expect you no more than  Antichrist  A Man that hath absented himself so long from his Friends ought to be put into the Gazette  Every Body here has great need of you Many Faces have died for ever for want of your Pencil and blooming Ladies have  wither'd in expecting your return Even  Frank  and  Betty  that constant Pair cannot console themselves for your Absence I fancy they will be forced to make their own Picture in a pretty Babe before you come home 'Twill be a noble Subject for a Family Piece Come then and having peopled  Ireland  with a World of beautiful Shadows come to us and see with that Eye which like the Eye of the World creates Beauties by looking on them see I say how  England  has altered the Airs of all its heads in your Absence and with what sneaking City Artitudes our most celebrated Personages appear inthe meer mortal Works of our Painters  Mr  Fortescue  is much yours  Gay  commemorates you and lastly to climb by just steps and degrees my Lord  Burlington  desires you may be put in mind of him His Gardens flourish his Structures rise his Pictures arrive and what is far nobler and more valuable than all his own good Qualities daily extend themselves to all about him Whereof I the meanest next to some  Italian  Chymists Fidlers Bricklayers and Operamakers am a living Instance  To the same  Nov  IF I had not done my utmost to lead my Life so pleasantly as to forget all Misfortunes I should tell you I reckoned your Absence no small one but I hope you have also had many good and pleasant Reasons to forget your Friends on this side the World If a wish could transport me to you and your present Companions I could do the same Dr  Swift  I believe is a very good Landlord and a chearful Host at his own Table I suppose he has perfectly learnt himself what he has taught so many others  Rupta non insanire lagena  Else he would not make a proper Host for your humble Servant who you know tho' he drinks a Glass as seldom as any Man contrives to break one as often But 'tis a Consolation to me that I can do this and many other Enormities under my own Roof  But that you and I are upon equal terms of all friendly Laziness and haven take an inviolable Oath to each other always to do what we will I should reproach you for so long a silence The best amends you can make for saying nothing to me is by saying  all the good you can of me which is that I heartily love and esteem the Dean and Dr  Parnelle  Gay  is yours and theirs His Spirit is awakened very much in the Cause of the Dean which has broke forth in a courageous Couplet or two upon Sir  Richard Bl  He has printed it with his name to it and bravely assigns no other Reason than that the said Sir  Richard  has abused Dr  Swift  I have also suffered in the like Cause and shall suffer more unless  Parnelle  sends me his  Zoilus  and  Bookworm  which the bishop of  Clogher  I hear greatly extols it will be shortly  Concurrere Bellum atque Virum  I love you all as much as I despise most Wits in this dull Country  Ireland  has turned the Tables upon  England  and if I have no Poetical Friend in my own Nation I'll be as proud as  Scipio  and say since I am reduced to Skin and Bone  Ingrata patria ne  ossa  quidem habeas  To the same  Nov  THAT you have not heard from me of late ascribe not to the usual laziness of your Correspondent but to a ramble to  Oxford  where your name is mentioned with honour even in a land flowing with Tories I had the good fortune there to be often in the conversation of Doctor  Clarke  He entertained me with several Drawings and particularly with the original designs of  Inigo Jones  's  Whitehall  I there saw and reverenced some of your first Pieces which future Painters are to look upon as we Poets do on the  Culex  of  Virgil  and  Batrachom  of  Homer  Having named this latter piece give me leave to ask what is become of Dr  Parnelle  and his Frogs  Oblitusque meorum obliviscendus illis  might be  Horace  's wish but will never be mine while I have such  meorums  as Dr  Parnelle  and Dr  Swift  I hope the spring will restore you to us and with you all the beauties and colours of nature Not but I congratulate you on the pleasure you must take in being admired in your own Country which so seldom happens to Prophets and Poets But in this you  have the Advantage of Poets you are Master of an Art that must prosper and grow rich as long as people love or are proud of themselves or their own persons However you have stay'd long enough methinks to have painted all the numberless Histories of old  Ogygiae  If you have begun to be Historical I recommend to your hand the story which every pious  Irishman  ought to begin with that of St  Patrick  To the end you may be obliged as Dr  P  was when he translated the  Batrachomuomachia  to come into  England  to copy the Frogs and such other Vermine as were never seen in that land since the time of that Confessor  I long to see you a History Painter You have already done enough for the Private do something for the Publick and be not confined like the rest to draw only such silly stories as our own faces tell of us The Ancients too expect you should do them right those Statues from which you learned your beautiful and noble Ideas demand it as a piece of Gratitude from you to make them truly known to all nations in the account you intend to write of their  Characters  I hope you think more warmly than ever of that noble design  As to your enquiry about your House when I come within the walls they put  me in mind of those of  Carthage  where your Friend like the wandring  Trojan  Animum Pictura pascit inani  For the spacious Mansion like a  Turkish  Caravanserah entertains the Vagabond with only bare Lodging I rule the Family very ill keep bad Hours and lend out your Pictures about the Town See what it is to have a Poet in your House  Frank  indeed does all he can in such a Circumstance for considering he has a wild Beast in it he constantly keeps the Door chain'd Every time it is open'd the Links rattle the rusty Hinges roar the House seems so sensible that you are its support that it is ready to drop in your Absence but I still trust my self under its Roof as depending that Providence will preserve so many  Raphaels Titian  and  Guido's  as are lodg'd in your Cabinet Surely the Sins of one Poet can hardly be so heavy as to bring an old House over the Heads of so many Painters In a word your House is falling but what of that I am only a Lodger  Mr Secretary  Craggs  to Mr  Pope  Paris  Sept  LAST post brought me the favour of your letter of the th  Aug O S  It would be taking too much upon me to decide that 'twas a Witty one I never pretend to more judgment than to know what pleases me and can assure you it was a very Agreeable one The proof I can give you of my sincerity in this Opinion is that I hope and desire you would not stop at this but continue more of them  I am in a place where Pleasure is continually flowing The Princes set the Example and the Subjects follow at a distance The Ladies are of all parties by which means the conversation of the Men is very much softened and fashioned from those blunt disputes on Politicks and rough Jests we are so guilty of while the Freedom of the Women takes away all Formality and Constraint I must own at the same time these Beauties are a little too artificial for my Taste you have seen a  French  Picture the Original is more painted and such a crust of Powder and essence in their Hair that you can see no difference between  black and red By disusing Stays and indulging themselves at a Table they are run out of all Shape but as to that they may give a good reason they prefer Conveniency to Parade and are by this means as ready as they are generally willing to be Charitable  I am surpriz'd to find I have wrote so much Scandal I fancy I am either setting up for a Wit or imagine I must write in this Style to a Wit I hope you'll prove a good natured one and not only let me hear from you sometimes but forgive the small Encouragement you meet with If you'll compleat your favours pray give my humble Services to Lords  W  ck St    and  H  y  I have had my hopes and fears they would have abused me before this Time I am sure it is not my business to meddle with a nest of Bees I speak only of the Honey I won't trouble my self to finish finely a true Compliment is better than a good one and I can assure you without any that I am very sincerely  SIR  Yours  c  The Rev  d  Dean  Afterwards Bishop of  Cloyne  in  Ireland  a celebrated Metaphysician Author of the Dialogues of  Hylas  and  Philonnses  the  Minute Philosopher  c  BERKLEY to Mr POPE  Naples  Oct N S  I Have long had it in my thoughts to trouble you with a Letter but was discouraged for want of something that I could think worth sending fifteen hundred Miles  Italy  is such an exhausted Subject that I dare say you'd easily forgive my saying nothing of it and the imagination of a Poet is a thing so nice and delicate that it is no easy matter to find out Images capable of giving Pleasure to one of the few who in any Age have come up to that Character I am nevertheless lately returned from an Island where I passed three or four Months which were it set out in its true Colours might methinks amuse you agreeably enough for a minute or two The Island  Inarime  is an Epitome of the whole Earth containing within the compass of eighteen Miles a wonderful variety of Hills Vales ragged Rocks fruitful Plains and barren Mountains all thrown together in a most romantic Confusion  The Air is in the hottest Season constantly refreshed by cool breezes from the Sea The Vales produce excellent Wheat and  Indian  Corn but are mostly covered with Vineyards intermixt with Fruittrees Besides the common kinds as Cherries Apricots Peaches  c  they produce Oranges Limes Almonds Pomegranates Figs Water Melons and many other Fruits unknown to our Climates which lie every where open to the Passenger The Hills are the greater part covered to the top with Vines some with Chesnut Groves and others with thickets of Myrtle and Lentiscus The Fields on the Northern side are divided by hedgerows of Myrtle Several Fountains and Rivulets add to the Beauty of this Landscape which is likewise set off by the variety of some barren Spots and naked Rocks But that which crowns the Scene is a large Mountain rising out of the middle of the Island once a terrible  Volcano  by the Ancients called  Mons Epomeus  its lower parts are adorned with Vines and other Fruits the middle affords Pasture to flocks of Goats and Sheep and the top is a sandy pointed Rock from which you have the finest Prospect in the World surveying at one view besides several pleasant Islands lying at your Feet a tract of  Italy  about three hundred Miles in length from the Promontory of  Antium  to  he Cape of  Palinurus  The greater part of which hath been sung by  Homer  and  Virgil  as making a considerable part of the Travels and Adventures of their two Heroes The Islands  Caprea Prochyta  and  Parthenope  together with  Cajeta Cumae Monte Miseno  the Habitations of  Circe  the  Syrens  and the  Lestrigones  the Bay of  Naples  the Promontory of  Minerva  and the whole  Campagnia felice  make but a part of this noble Landscape which would demand an Imagination as warm and numbers as flowing as your own to describe it The Inhabitants of this delicious Isle as they are without Riches and Honours so are they without the Vices and Follies that attend them and were they but as much strangers to Revenge as they are to Avarice or Ambition they might in fact answer the poetical Notions of the Golden Age But they have got as an alloy to their Happiness an ill habit of murdering one another on flight Offences We had an Instance of this the second Night after our Arrival a Youth of eighteen being shot dead by our Door And yet by the sole secret of minding our own business we found a means of living securely among these dangerous People Would you know how we pass the time at  Naples  Our chief Entertainment is the Devotion of our Neighbours Besides the  gayety of their Churches where Folks go to see what they call  una Bella Devotione  i e a sort of Religious Opera they make Fireworks almost every Week out of Devotion the Streets are often hung with Arras out of Devotion and what is still more strange the Ladies invite Gentlemen to their Houses and treat them with Musick and Sweetmeats out of Devotion in a word were it not for this Devotion of its inhabitants  Naples  would have little else to recommend it beside the Air and Situation Learning is in no very thriving state here as indeed no where else in  Italy  However among many pretenders some Men of taste are to be met with A Friend of mine told me not long since that being to visit  Salvini  at  Florence  he found him reading your  Homer  He liked the Notes extreamly and could find no other fault with the Version but that he thought it approached too near a Paraphrase which shews him not to be sufficiently acquainted with our Language I wish you Health to go on with that noble Work and when you have that I need not wish you Success You will do me the Justice to believe that whatever relates to your Welfare is sincerely wished by  Yours  c  portrait of Jonathan Swift  IONAT SWIFT  Dean S  t  Pat in Hib  Non Pareil  Mr  Pope  to  Dec  THE old project of a Window in the bosom to render the Soul of Man visible is what every honest friend has manifold reason to wish for yet even that would not do in our case while you are so far separated from me and so long I begin to fear you'll die in  Ireland  and that the Denunciation will be fulfilled upon you  Hibernus es in Hiberniam reverteris  I shou'd be apt to think you in  Sancho  's case some Duke has made you Governor of an Island or wet place and you are administring Laws to the wild  Irish  But I must own when you talk of  Building  and  Planting  you touch my String and I am as apt to pardon you as the Fellow that thought himself  Jupiter  would have pardon'd the other Madman who call'd himself his Brother  Neptune  Alas Sir do you know whom you talk to One that had been a Poet was degraded to a Translator and at last thro' meer dulness is turn'd an Architect You know  Martial  's Censure  Praeconem facito vel Architectum  However I have one way left to plan to  elevate  and  to surprize  as  Bays  says The next you may expect to hear is that I am in Debt  The History of my Transplantation and Settlement which you desire would require a Volume were I to enumerate the many projects difficulties vicissitudes and various fates attending that important part of my Life Much more should I describe the many Draughts Elevations Profiles Perspectives  c  of every Palace and Garden propos'd intended and happily raised by the strength of that Faculty wherein all great Genius's excel Imagination At last the Gods and Fate have fix'd me on the borders of the  Thames  in the Districts of  Richmond  and  Twickenham  It is here I have passed an entire Year of my life without any fix'd abode in  London  or more than casting a transitory glance for a day or two at most in a Month on the pomps of the Town It is here I hope to receive you Sir return'd in triumph from Eternizing the  Ireland  of  this Age  For you my Structures rise for you my Colonades extend their Wings for you my Groves aspire and Roses bloom And to say truth I hope Posterity which no doubt will be made acquainted with all these things will look upon it as one of the principal Motives of my Architecture that it was a Mansion prepar'd to receive you against your own  should fall to dust which is destin'd to be the Tomb of poor  and  and the immortal Monument of the Fidelity of two such Servants who have excell'd in Constancy the very Rats of your Family  What more can I tell you of my self so much and yet all put together so little that I scarce care or know how to do it But the very reasons that are against putting it upon Paper are as strong for telling it you in Person and I am uneasy to be so long deny'd the satisfaction of it  At present I consider you bound in by the  Irish  Sea like the Ghosts in  Virgil  Tristi palus inamabilis unda  Alligat novies Styx circumfusa coercet  and I can't express how I long to renew our old intercourse and conversation our morning Conferences in bed in the same Room our evening Walks in the Park our amusing Voyages on the Water our philosophical Suppers our Lectures our Dissertations our Gravities our Reveries our Fooleries our what notThis awakens the memory of some of those who have made a part in all these Poor  Parnelle Garth Rowe  You justly reprove me for not speaking of the Death of the last  Parnelle  was too much in my mind to  whose Memory I am erecting the best Monument I can What he gave me to publish was but a small part of what he left behind him but it was the best and I will not make it worse by enlarging it I'd fain know if he be buried at  Chester  or  Dublin  and what care has been or is to be taken for his Monument  c  Yet I have not neglected my Devoirs to Mr  Rowe  I am writing this very day his Epitaph for  WestminsterAbbey  After these the best natur'd of Men Sir  Samuel Garth  has left me in the truest concern for his loss His Death was very Heroical and yet unaffected enough to have made a Saint or a Philosopher famous But ill Tongues and worse Hearts have branded even his last Moments as wrongfully as they did his Life with Irreligion You must have heard many Tales on this Subject but if ever there was a good Christian without knowing himself to be so it was Dr  Garth  I am  c  LETTERS OF Mr  Wycherley  and Mr  Pope  From the Year to  The Author's Age then Sixteen  Mr POPE to Mr WYCHERLEY  Decemb  IT was certainly a great Satisfaction to me to see and converse with a Man whom in his Writings I had so long known with Pleasure But it was a high addition to it to hear you at our very first meeting doing justice to your dead friend Mr  Dryden  I was not so happy as to know him  Virgilium tantum vidi  Had I been born early enough I must have known and lov'd him For I have been assur'd not only by your self but by Mr  Congreve  and Sir  William Trumbul  that his personal Qualities were as amiable as his Poetical notwithstanding the many libellous Misrepresentations of them against which the former of these Gentlemen has told me he will one day vindicate him  He since did so in his Dedication to the Duke of  Newcastle  prefix'd to  Tonson  's  Duodecimo  Edition of  Dryden  's Plays  I suppose those Injuries were begun by the Violence of Party but 'tis no doubt they were continu'd by Envy at his success and fame And those Scriblers who attack'd him in his latter times were only like Gnats in a Summer's Evening which are never very troublesome but in the finest and most glorious Season for his Fire like the Sun's shin'd clearest towards its setting  You must not therefore imagine that when you told me of my own Performances that they were above those Criticks I was so vain as to believe it and yet I may not be so humble as to think my self quite below their Notice For Critics as they are Birds of Prey have ever a natural Inclination to Carrion And though such poor Writers as I are but Beggars however no Beggar is so poor but he can keep a Cur and no Author is so beggarly but he can keep a Critic So I'm sar from  thinking the Attacks of such people either any honour or dishonour even to me much less to Mr  Dryden  I think with you that whatever lesser Wits have risen since his Death are but like Stars appearing when the Sun is set that twinkle only in his Absence and with the Rays they have borrowed from him Our Wit as you call itis but Reflection or Imitation therefore scarce to be call'd ours True Wit I believe may be defin'd Justness of Thought and a Facility of Expression or in the Midwives Phrase a perfect Conception with an easy Delivery However this is far from a compleat Definition pray help me to a better as I doubt not you can  I am  c  Mr WYCHERLEY to Mr POPE  Jan  I HAVE been so busy of late in correcting and transcribing some of my Madrigals for a great Man or two who desir'd to see them that I have with your Pardon omitted to return you an Answer to your most ingenious Letter So Scriblers to the Publick like Bankers to the Publick are profuse in their voluntary Loans  to it whilst they forget to pay their more private and particular as more just Debts to their best and nearest Friends However I hope you who have as much GoodNature as Good Sense since they generally are Companions will have Patience with a Debtor who you think has an Inclination to pay you his Obligations if he had wherewithal ready about him and in the mean time should consider when you have oblig'd me beyond my present Power of returning the Favour that a Debtor may be an honest Man if he but intends to be just when he is able tho' late But I should be less just to you the more I thought I could make a Return to so much Profuseness of Wit and Humanity together which though they seldom accompany each other in other Men are in you so equally met I know not in which you most abound But so much for my Opinion of you which is that your Wit and Ingenuity is equall'd by nothing but your Judgment or Modesty which though it be to please my self I must no more offend than I can do either right  Therefore I will say no more now of them than that your good Wit ne'er forfeited your good Judgment but in your Partiality to me and mine so that if it  were possible for a harden'd Scribler to be vainer than he is what you write of me would make me more conceited than what I scribble my self yet I must confess I ought to be more humbled by your Praise than exalted which commends my little Sense with so much more of yours that I am disparag'd and dishearten'd by your Commendations who give me an Example of your Wit in the first Part of your Letter and a Definition of it in the last to make writing well that is like you more difficult to me than ever it was before Thus the more great and just your Example and Definition of Wit are the less I am capable to follow them Then the best way of shewing my Judgment after having seen how you write is to leave off writing and the best way to shew my Friendship to you is to put an end to your Trouble and to conclude  Your  c  Mr POPE's Answer  March  WHEN I write to you I foresee a long Letter and ought to beg your  Patience beforehand for if it proves the longest it will be of course the worst I have troubled you with Yet to express my Gratitude at large for your obliging Letter is not more my Duty than my Interest as some People will abundantly thank you for one Piece of Kindness to put you in mind of bestowing another The more favourable you are to me the more distinctly I see my Faults Spots and Blemishes you know are never so plainly discover'd as in the brightest Sunshine Thus I am mortified by those Commendations which were design'd to encourage me for Praise to a young Wit is like Rain to a tender Flower if it be moderately bestow'd it chears and revives but if too lavishly overcharges and depresses him Most Men in years as they are generally discouragers of Youth are like old Trees that being past Bearing themselves will suffer no young Plants to flourish beneath them But as if it were not enough to have outdone all your Coaevals in Wit you will excel them in GoodNature too As for my  His  Pastorals  written at Years of Age  green Essays if you find any pleasure in 'em it must be such as a Man naturally takes in observing the first Shoots and Buddings of a Tree which he  has rais'd himself and 'tis impossible they should be esteem'd any otherwise than as we value Fruits for being early which nevertheless are the most insipid and the worst of the Year In a word I must blame you for treating me with so much Compliment which is at best but the Smoak of Friendship I neither write nor converse with you to gain your Praise but your Affection Be so much my Friend as to appear my Enemy and tell me my Faults if not as a young Man at least as an unexperienc'd Writer  I am  c  Mr WYCHERLEY to Mr POPE  March  YOUR Letter of the Twentyfifth of  March  I have received which was more welcome to me than any thing cou'd be out of the Country tho' it were one's Rent due that Day and I can find no fault with it but that it charges me with Want of Sincerity or Justice for giving you your Due who shou'd not let your Modesty be so unjust to your Merit as to reject  what is due to it and call that Compliment which is so short of your desert that it is rather degrading than exalting you But if Compliment be the Smoak only of Friendship as you say however you must allow there is no Smoak but there is some Fire and as the Sacrifice of Incense offer'd to the Gods wou'd not have been half so sweet to others if it had not been for its Smoak so Friendship like Love cannot be without some Incense to perfume the Name it would praise and immortalize But since you say you do not write to me to gain my  Praise  but my  Affection  pray how is it possible to have the one without the other We must admire besore we love You affirm you would have me so much your Friend as to appear your Enemy and find out your Faults rather than your Perfections But my Friend that would be so hard to do that I who love no Difficulties can't be persuaded to it Besides the Vanity of a Scribler is such that he will never part with his own Judgment to gratify another's especially when he must take pains to do it And tho' I am proud to be of your Opinion when you talk of any Thing or Man but your self I cannot suffer you to murther your Fame with your own hand without opposing you especially when you say your last Letter  is the worst since the longest you have favoured me with which I therefore think the best as the longest Life if a good one is the best as it yields the more Variety and is more Exemplary as a chearful Summer's Day tho' longer than a dull one in the Winter is less tedious and more entertaining Therefore let but your Friendship be like your Letter as lasting as it is agreeable and it can never be tedious but more acceptable and obliging to  Your  c  Mr WYCHERLEY to Mr POPE  April  I HAVE receiv'd yours of the Fifth wherein your Modesty refuses the just Praises I give you by which you lay claim to more as a Bishop gains his Bishoprick by saying he will not Episcopate But I must confess whilst I displease you by commending you I please my self just as Incense is sweeter to the Offerer than the Deity to whom 'tis offered by his being so much above it For indeed every Man partakes of the Praise he gives when it is so justly given  As to my enquiry after your Intrigues with the  Muses  you may allow me to make it since no old Man can give so young so great and able a Favourite of theirs Jealousy I am in my Enquiry like old Sir  Bernard Gascoign  who us'd to say That when he was grown too old to have his Visits admitted alone by the Ladies he always took along with him a young Man to ensure his Welcome to them who had he come alone had been rejected only because his Visits were not scandalous to them So I am like an old Rook who is ruin'd by Gaming forc'd to live on the good Fortune of the pushing young Men whose Fancies are so vigorous that they ensure their Success in their Adventures with the Muses by their Strength of Imagination  Your Papers are safe in my Custody you may be sure from any one's Theft but my own for 'tis as dangerous to trust a Scribler with your Wit as a Gamester with the Custody of your MoneyIf you happen to come to Town you will make it more difficult for me to leave it who am dear Mr  Pope  Your  c  Mr POPE's Answer  April  I Cannot contend with you You must give me leave at once to wave all your Compliments and to collect only this in general from 'em that your Design is to encourage me But I separate from all the rest that Paragraph or two in which you make me so warm an Offer of your Friendship Were I possess'd of That it would put an end to all those Speeches with which you now make me blush and change them to wholesome Advices and free Sentiments which might make me wiser and happier I know 'tis the general Opinion that Friendship is best contracted betwixt Persons of equal Age but I have so much Interest to be of another Mind that you must pardon me if I cannot forbear telling you a few Notions of mine in opposition to that Opinion  In the first place 'tis observable that the Love we bear to our Friends is generally caused by our finding the same Dispositions in them which we feel in our selves This is but Selflove at the bottom Whereas the Affection betwixt People of different Ages cannot well be such the Inclinations of such  being commonly various The Friendship of two young Men is often occasioned by Love of Pleasure or Voluptuousness each being desirous for his own sake of one to assist or incourage him in the Courses he pursues as that of two old Men is frequently on the score of some Profit Lucre or Design upon others Now as a young Man who is less acquainted with the Ways of the World has in all probability less of Interest and an old Man who may be weary of himself less of Selflove so the Friendship between them is the more likely to be true and unmix'd with too much Selfregard One may add to this that such a Friendship is of greater Use and Advantage to both for the old Man will grow more gay and agreeable to please the young one and the young Man more discreet and prudent by the help of the old one so it may prove a Cure of those epidemical Diseases of Age and Youth Sourness and Madness I hope you will not need many Arguments to convince you of the Possibility of this One alone abundantly satisfies me and convinces to the very Heart which is that  I am  c  Mr  Wycherley  was at this time about Seventy Years old Mr  Pope  under Seventeen  Mr POPE to Mr WYCHERLEY  June  I Shou'd believe my self happy in your good Opinion but that you treat me so much in a Style of Compliment It has been observ'd of Women that they are more subject in their youth to be touch'd with Vanity than Men on account of their being generally treated this way but the weakest Women are not more so than that weak Class of Men who are thought to pique themselves upon their Wit The World is never wanting when a Coxcomb is accomplishing himself to help to give him the finishing Stroke  Every Man is apt to think his Neighbour overstock'd with Vanity yet I cannot but fancy there are certain Times when most people are in a disposition of being inform'd and 'tis incredible what a vast Good a little Truth might do spoken in such seasons A very small Alms will do a great kindness to people in extream necessity  I could name an acquaintance of yours who wou'd at this time think himself more oblig'd to you for the Information of his Faults than the Confirmation of his Follies If you would make those the Subject of a Letter it might be as long as I could wish your Letters always were  I do not wonder you have hitherto found some difficulty as you are pleas'd to say in writing to me since you have always chosen the Task of commending me Take but the other way and I dare ingage you will find none at all  As for my Verses which you praise so much I may truly say they had never been the cause of any Vanity in me except what they gave me when they first occasion'd my acquaintance with you But I have several times since been in danger of this Vice as often I mean as I receiv'd any Letters from you  'Tis certain the greatest magnifying Glasses in the World are a Man's own Eyes when they look upon his own Person yet even in those I cannot fancy my self so extremely like  Alexander the Great  as you wou'd persuade me If I must be like him 'tis you will make me so  by complimenting me into a better opinion of my self than I deserve They made him think he was the  Son of Jupiter  and you assure me I am a Man of Parts But is this all you can say to my honour You said ten times as much before when you call'd me your Friend After having made me believe I possess'd a share in your Affection to treat me with Compliments and sweet Sayings is like the proceeding with poor  Sancho 'Panca  They had persuaded him that he enjoy'd a great Dominion and then gave him nothing to subsist upon but  Wafers  and  Marmalade  In our Days the greatest obligation you can lay upon a Wit is to make a Fool of him For as when Madmen are found incurable wise Men give them their Way and please them as well as they can so when those incorrigible things Poets are once irrecoverably BeMus'd the best way both to quiet them and secure your selves from the effects of their Frenzy is to feed their Vanity which indeed for the most part is all that is fed in a Poet  You may believe me I could be heartily glad that all you say were as true apply'd to me as it wou'd be to your self for several weighty Reasons but for none so much as that I might be to you what you  deserve whereas I can now be no more than is consistent with the small tho' utmost Capacity of  Dear Sir  Your ever affectionate Servant  Mr POPE to Mr WYCHERLEY  Oct  I HAVE now chang'd the Scene from the Town to the Country from  Will  's CoffeeHouse to  Windsor  Forest I find no other difference than this betwixt the common TownWits and the downright Country Fools that the first are pertly in the Wrong with a little more Flourish and Gaiety and the last neither in the Right nor the Wrong but confirmed in a stupid settled Medium betwixt both However methinks these are most in the Right who quietly and easily resign themselves over to the gentle Reign of Dulness which the Wits must do at last tho' after a great deal of Noise Pother and Resistance Ours are a sort of modest inoffensive People who neither have Sense nor pretend to any but enjoy a jovial Sort of Dulness They are commonly known in the World by the Name of honest civil Gentlemen They live much as they ride at random a kind of hunting Life pursuing with earnestness and hazard something not worth the catching never in the way nor out of it I can't but preser Solitude to the Company of all these for tho' a  Man's self may possibly be the worst Fellow to converse with in the world yet one would think the Company of a Person whom we have the greatest regard to and affection for could not be very unpleasant As a Man in love with a Mistress desires no conversation but hers so a Man in love with himself as most Men are may be best pleased with his own Besides if the truest and most useful Knowledge be the Knowledge of our selves Solitude conducing most to make us look into our selves should be the most instructive State of Life We see nothing more commonly than Men who for the sake of the circumstantial Part and meer outside of Life have been half their Days rambling out of their Nature and ought to be sent into Solitude to study themselves over again People are usually spoil'd instead of being taught at their coming into the World whereas by being more conversant with Obseurity without any Pains they would naturally follow what they were meant for In a word if a Man be a Coxcomb Solitude is his best School and if he be a Fool it is his best Sanctuary  These are good Reasons for my own Stay here but I wish I could give you any for your coming hither except that I earnestly invite you And yet I can't help  saying I have suffered a great deal of discontent that you do not tho' I so little merit that you should  I must complain of the shortness of your last Those who have most Wit like those who have most Money are generally most sparing of either  Mr WYCHERLEY's Answer  Nov  YOURS of the th of  October  I have received as I have always done yours with no little Satisfaction and am proud to discover by it that you find fault with the shortness of mine which I think the best Excuse for it And tho' they as you say who have most Wit or Money are most sparing of either there are some who appear Poor to be thought Rich and are Poor which is my Case I cannot but rejoice that you have undergone so much discontent for want of my company but if you have a mind to punish me for my fault which I could not help defer your coming to Town and you will do it effectually But I know your Charity always exceeds your Revenge so that I will not  despair of seeing you who in return to your inviting me to your Forest invite you to my Forest the Town where the Beasts that inhabit tame or wild of long Ears or Horns pursue one another either out of Love or Hatred You may have the Pleasure to see one Pack of Bloodhounds pursue another Herd of Brutes to bring each other to their Fall which is their whole Sport Or if you affect a less bloody Chace you may see a Pack of Spaniels called  Lovers  in a hot pursuit of a two legg'd  Vixen  who only flies the whole low'd Pack to be singled out by one Dog who runs mute to catch her up the sooner from the rest as they are making a Noise to the Loss of their Game In fine this is the Time for all sorts of Sport in the Town when those of the Country cease therefore leave your Forest of Beasts for ours of Brutes call'd Men who now in full Cry pack'd by the Court or Country run down in the House of Commons a deserted horned Beast of the Court to the satisfaction of their Spectators Besides more for your Diversion you may see not only the two great Playhouses of the Nation those of the Lords and Commons in Dispute with one another but the two other Playhouses in high Contest because the Members of one House are remov'd  up to t'other as it is often done by the Court for Reasons of State Insomuch that the lower Houses I mean the Playhouses are going to act Tragedies on one another without Doors and the Sovereign is put to it as it often happens in the other two Houses to silence one or both to keep Peace between them Now I have told you all the News of the Town  I am  c  Mr WYCHERLEY to Mr POPE  Feb  I HAVE receiv'd your kind Letter with my Paper  The same which was printed in the Year in a  Miscellany  of  Bern Lintot  's and in the present Edition of the Posthumous Works of Mr  Wycherley  to Mr  Dryden  corrected I own you have made more of it by making it less as the  Dutch  are said to burn half the Spices they bring home to inhance the Price of the remainder so to be greater Gainers by their Loss which is indeed my Case now Well you have prun'd my sading Laurels of some superfluous sapless  and dead Branches to make the remainder live the longer thus like your Master  Apollo  you are at once a Poet and a Physician  Now Sir as to my impudent invitation of you to the Town your GoodNature was the first Cause of my confident request but excuse me I must I see say no more upon this Subject since I find you a little too nice to be dealt freely with tho' you have given me some Encouragement to hope our Friendship tho' young might be without Shyness or criminal Modesty for a Friend like a Mistress tho' he is not to be mercenary to be true yet ought not to refuse a Friend's kindness because it is small or trivial I have told you I think that a  Spanish  Lady said to her poor poetical Gallant that a Queen if she lay with a Groom would expect a mark of his kindness from him tho' it were but his Currycomb But you and I will dispute this Matter when I am so happy as to see you here and perhaps 'tis the only Dispute in which I might hope to have the better of you  Now Sir to make you another excuse for my boldness in inviting you to Town I design'd to leave with you some more of my Papers since these return so much better out of your Hands than they went from mine for I intended as I told you formerly  to spend a Month or six Weeks this Summer near you in the Country for you may be assured there is nothing I desire so much as an Improvement of your Friendship  Mr WYCHERLEY to Mr POPE  March  I MUST lay a penance upon you which is to desire you to look over that damn'd Miscellany of Madrigals of mine to pick out if possible some that may be so alter'd that they may yet appear in Print again I hope with better success than they hitherto have done I will give you my Reason for this Request of mine when I see you which I am resolv'd shall be when I have done here and at the  Bath  where I design to go and afterwards to spend two Months God willing with you at  Binfield  or near it  Mr POPE's Answer  April  BY yours of the last Month you desire me to select if possible some Things from the  Printed in  Folio  in the Year  first Volume of your Miscellanies which may be alter'd so as to appear again I doubted your meaning in this whether it was to pick out the best of those Verses as that on the  Idleness of Business  on  Ignorance  on  Laziness  c to make the Method and Numbers exact and avoid Repetitions For tho' upon reading 'em on this occasion I believe they might receive such an Alteration with advantage yet they would not be chang'd so much but any one would know 'em for the same at first sight Or if you mean to improve the worst Pieces which are such as to render them very good would require a great addition and almost the entire new writing of them Or lastly if you mean the middle sort as the Songs and LoveVerses For these will need only to be shortned to omit repetition the Words remaining very little different from what they were before Pray let me know  your mind in this for I am utterly at a loss Yet I have try'd what I could do to some of the  Songs  Vid  Letter of  Nov  a  and the  Poems  on  Laziness  and  Ignorance  but can't e'en in my own partial Judgment think my alterations much to the purpose So that I must needs desire you would apply your Gare wholly at present to those which are yet unpublished of which there are more than enough to make a consierable Volume of full as good ones nay I verily believe of better than any in Vol I which I could wish you would defer at least 'till you have finish'd these that are yet unprinted  I send you a Sample of some few of these namely the Verses to Mr  Waller  in  his old Age  your new ones on the  Duke of Marlborough  and two others I have done all that I thought could be of advantage to them Some I have contracted as we do Sunbeams to improve their Energy and Force some I have taken quite away as we take Branches from a Tree to add to the Fruit others I have entirely new express'd and turned more into Poetry  Donne  like one of his Successors had infinitely more Wit than he wanted Versification for the great dealers  in Wit like those in Trade take least Pains to set off their Goods while the Haberdashers of small Wit spare for no Decorations or Ornaments You have commission'd me to paint your Shop and I have done my best to brush you up like your Neighbours But I can no more pretend to the Merit of the Production than a Midwife to the Virtues and good Qualities of the Child she helps into the Light  The few Things I have entirely added you will excuse you may take them lawfully for your own because they are no more than Sparks lighted up by your Fire and you may omit them at last if you think them but Squibs in your Triumphs  I am  c  Mr WYCHERLEY to Mr POPE  Feb  I HAVE received yours of the th as kind as it is ingenious for which therefore I most heartily thank you It would have been much more welcome to me had it not inform'd me of your want of Health But you who have a Mind so  vigorous may well be contented with its crazy Habitation since you know the old Similitude says The Keenness of the Mind soonest wears out the Body as the sharpest Sword soonest destroys the Scabbard So that as I say you must be satisfied with your apprehension of an uneasy Life tho' I hope not a short one notwithstanding that generally you sound Wits tho' weak Bodies are immortal hereafter by that Genius which shortens your present Life to prolong that of the future But I yet hope your great vigorous and active Mind will not be able to destroy your little tender and crazy Carcass  Now to say something to what you write concerning the present epidemick Distemper of the Mind and Age Calumny I know it is no more to be avoided at one time or another of our Lives than a Fever or an Ague and as often those Distempers attend or threaten the best Constitutions from the worst Air so does that malignant Air of Calumny soonest attack the sound and elevated in Mind as Storms of Wind the tallest and most fruitful Trees whilst the low and weak for bowing and moving to and fro are by their Weakness secure from the danger and violence of the Tempest But so much for stinking Rumour which weakest Minds are most afraid  of as  IrishMen  tho' the nastiest of Mankind are most offended at a  Fart  Mr WYCHERLEY to Mr POPE  Nov  I Receiv'd yours of the th yesterday which has like the rest of your Letters at once pleas'd and instructed me so that I assure you you can no more write too much to your absent Friends than speak too much to the present This is a Truth that all Men own who have either seen your Writings or heard your Discourse enough to make others show their Judgment in ceasing to write or talk especially to you or in your company However I speak or write to you not to please you but my self since I provoke your Answers which whilst they humble me give me vanity tho' I am lessen'd by you even when you commend me since you commend my little Sense with so much more of yours that you put me out of Countenance whilst you would keep me in it So that you have found a way against the Custom of great Wits to shew even a great deal of GoodNature with a great deal of good Sense  I thank you for the Book you promis'd me by which I find you would not only correct my Lines but my Life  As to the damn'd Verses I entrusted you with I hope you will let them undergo your Purgatory to save them from other People's damning them since the Criticks who are generally the first damn'd in this Life like the Damn'd below never leave to bring those above them under their own Circumstances I beg you to peruse my Papers and select what you think best or most tolerable and look over them again for I resolve suddenly to print some of them as a harden'd old Gamester will in spite of all former ill usage by Fortune push on an ill Hand in expectation of recovering himself especially since I have such a  Croupier  or Second to stand by me as Mr  Pope  Mr POPE to Mr WYCHERLEY  Nov  MR  Englefyld  being upon his Journey to  London  tells me I must write to you by him which I do not more to comply with his desire than to gratify my own tho' I did it so lately by the Messenger you sent hither I take it too as an opportunity of sending you the fair Copy of the  Poem  The Original of it in Blots and with Figures of the References from Copy to Copy in Mr  Pope's  Hand is in the  HarleyLibrary  among other such  Brouillons  of Mr  Wycherley  's Poems corrected by him  Vid Lett Ap    Note  a  on  Dulness  which was not then finish'd and which I should not care to hazard by the common Post Mr  Englefyld  is ignorant of the Contents and I hope your prudence will let him remain so for my sake no less than your own Since if you should reveal any thing of this nature it would be no wonder Reports should be rais'd and there are those I fear who would be ready to improve them to my disadvantage I am sorry you told the great Man whom you met in the  Court of Requests  that your Papers were in my hands No Man alive shall ever know any such thing from me and  I give you this warning besides that tho' your self should say I had any way assisted you I am notwithstanding resolv'd to deny it  The method of the Copy I send you is very different from what it was and much more regular For the better help of your Memory I desire you to compare it by the  Figures  in the Margin answering to the same in this Letter The Poem is now divided into four Parts mark'd with the literal Figures I II III IV The first contains the  Praise  of Dulness and shews how upon several suppositions it passes for Religion Philosophy Example Wit And The cause of Wit and the end of it The second Part contains the  Advantages  of Dulness st In Business and dly at Court where the Similitudes of the Byass of a Bowl and the Weights of a Clock are directly tending to illustrate those advantages of Dulness tho' introduced before in a place where there was no mention made of them which was your only objection to my adding them The third contains the  Happiness  of Dulness in all Stations and shews in a great many Particulars that it is so fortunate as to be esteem'd some good Quality or other in all sorts of People that it is thought Quiet Sense Caution  Policy Prudence Majesty Valour Circumspection Honesty  c  The fourth Part I have wholly added as a Climax which sums up all the  praise advantage  and  happiness  of Dulness in a few words and strengthens them all by the opposition of the  disgrace disadvantage  and  unhappiness  of Wit with which it concludes  This is totally omitted in the present Edition Some of the Lines in the H M are these  Thus Dulness the safe Opiate of the Mind  The last kind refuge weary Wit can find  Fit for all stations and in each content  Is satisfy'd secure and innocent  No pains it takes and no offence it gives  Unfear'd unhated undisturb'd it lives  c    Tho' the whole be as short again as at first there is not one Thought omitted but what is a Repetition of something in your first Volume or in this very Paper Some Thoughts are contracted where they seem'd encompass'd with too many words and some new express'd or added where I thought there wanted heightning as you'll see particularly in the Simile of the  ClockWeights  It was originally thus express'd  As Clocks run fastest when most Lead is on  We find it so in a Letter of Mr  Pope  to Mr  Wycherley  dated  April  and in a paper of Verses of his  To the Author of a Poem call'd Successio  which got out in a Miscellany in three Years before Mr  Wycherley  died and two after he had laid aside the whole design of publishing any Poems  and the Versification throughout is I believe such as no body can be shock'd at The repeated Permissions you give me of dealing freely with you will I hope excuse what I have done for if I have not spar'd you when I thought Severity would do you a kindness I have not mangled you where I thought there was no absolute need of Amputation As to Particulars I can satisfy you better when we meet in the mean time pray write to me when you can you cannot too often  Mr WYCHERLEY's Answer  Nov  YOU may see by my Stile I had the happiness and satisfaction to receive yesterday by the hands of that Wagg Mr  Englefyld  your extreme kind and obliging Letter of the th of this Month which like all the rest of yours did at once mortify me and make me vain since it tells me with so much more Wit Sense and Kindness than mine can express that my Letters are always welcome to you So that even whilst your Kindness invites me to write to you your Wit and Judgment  forbids me since I may return you a Letter but never an Answer  Now as for my owning your assistance to me in overlooking my unmusical Numbers and harsher Sense and correcting them both with your Genius or Judgment I must tell you I always own it in spite of your unpoetick Modesty who would do with your Friendship as your Charity conceal your Bounty to magnify the Obligation and even whilst you lay on your Friend the Favour acquit him of the Debt But that shall not serve your turn I will always own 'tis my infallible Pope has or would redeem me from a poetical Damning the second time and save my Rhimes from being condemn'd to the Criticks Flames to all Eternity But by the Faith you prosess you know your Works of Supererrogation transfer'd upon an humble acknowledging Sinner may save even Him having good Works enough of your own besides to ensure yours and their Immortality  And now for the pains you have taken to recommend my  Dulness  by making it more methodical I give you a thousand thanks since true and natural  Dulness  is shown more by its pretence to form and method as the Sprightliness of Wit by its despising both I thank you a thousand  times for your repeated Invitations to come to  Binfield  You will find it will be as hard for you to get quit of my mercenary kindness to you as it would for me to deserve or return yours however it shall be the Endeavour of my future Life as it will be to demonstrate my self  Your  c  Mr POPE's Reply  Nov  THE Compliments you make me in regard of any inconsiderable Service I could do you are very unkind and do but tell me in other words that my Friend has so mean an opinion of me as to think I expect acknowledgments for trifles which upon my faith I shall equally take amiss whether made to my self or to any others For God's sake my dear Friend  Wycherley  think better of me and believe I desire no sort of Favour so much as that of serving you more considerably than I have yet been able to do  I shall proceed in this manner with some others of your Pieces but since you  desire I would not deface your Copy for the future and only mark the Repetitions I must as soon as I've mark'd these transcribe what is left on another Paper and in that blot alter and add all I can devise for their Improvement For you are sensible the Omission of  Repetitions  is but one and the easiest Part of yours and my Design there remaining besides to rectify the  Method  to  connect  the  Matter  and to mend the  Expression  and  Versification  I will go next upon the  Some  Broüillons  of these transcrib'd and very much blotted by Mr  Pope  are extant in the  Harley Library  Poems of  Solitude  on the  Publick  and on the  mixt Life  the  Bill of Fare  the  Praises of Avarice  and some others  I must take some Notice of what you say of  "My pains to make your Dulness methodical"  and of your hint that  "The sprightliness of Wit despises method"  This is true enough if by  Wit  you mean no more than  Fancy  or  Conceit  but in the better notion of  Wit  consider'd as propriety surely  Method  is not only necessary for Perspicuity and Harmony of parts but gives beauty even to the minute and particular thoughts which receive an additional advantage from those which precede or follow in their due place According  to a Simile Mr  Dryden  us'd in conversation of Feathers in the Crowns of the wild  Indians  which they not only chuse for the beauty of their Colours but place them in such a manner as to reflect a Lustre on each other I will not disguise any of my Sentiments from you To  methodize  in your Case is full as necessary as to  strike out  otherwise you had better destroy the whole Frame and reduce them into  single Thoughts  in  Prose  like  Rochfoucault  as I have more than once hinted to you  Mr WYCHERLEY to Mr POPE  Feb  I HAVE had yours of the d of this Instant for which I give you many thanks since I find by it that even Absence the usual bane of Love or Friendship cannot lessen yours to more than mine  Mr  Pope  had this from Mr  Cromwell  after his Enquiry in these Words  "I returned to Town last  Saturday  and inquiring as you desir'd about Mr  Wycherley  was told in two several Places that he had been very ill and that he was even gone off our Stage But I could not imagine this report to be true or that so great a Man could leave the World without its being instructed to lament so considerable a Loss"  As to your hearing of my being ill I am glad  and sorry for the report In the first place glad that it was not true and in the next sorry that it shou'd give you any disturbance or concern more than ordinary for me for which as well as your concern for my future wellbeing or life I think my self most eternally oblig'd to you assuring your concern for either will make me more careful of both Yet for your sake I love this Life so well that I shall the less think of the other but 'tis in your power to ensure my Happiness in one and the other both by your society and good Example so not only contribute to my felicity here but hereaster  Now as to your Excuse for the plainness of your Style or Letter I must needs tell you that Friendship is much more acceptable to a true Friend than Wit which is generally salse Reasoning and a Friend's reprimand often shews more Friendship than his compliment Nay Love which is more than Friendship is often seen by our Friend's correction of our Follies or Crimes Upon this Test of your Friendship I intend to put you when I return to  London  and thence to you at  Binfield  which I hope will be within a Month  Next to the News of your good Health I am pleas'd with the good News of your going to print some of your Poems and  proud to be known by them to the Publick for your Friend who intend perhaps the same way to be reveng'd of you for your kindness by taking your Name in vain in some of my future Madrigals yet so as to let the World know my love or esteem for you are no more Poetick than my Talent in scribbling But of all the Arts of Fiction I desire you to believe I want that of feigning Friendship and that I am sincerely  Your  c  Mr WYCHERLEY to Mr POPE  May  I HAVE receiv'd yours of the first of  May  Your Pastoral Muse outshines in her modest and natural dress all  Apollo  's CourtLadies in their more artful labour'd and costly Finery therefore I am glad to find by your Letter you design your Countrybeauty of a Muse shall appear at Court and in Publick to outshine all the farded lewd confident affected Towndowdies who aim at being honour'd only to their Shame But her artful Innocence on the contrary will gain more Honour as she  becomes more publick and in spite of Custom will bring Modesty again into Fashion or at least make her Sisterrivals of this Age blush for Spite if not for Shame As for my stale antiquated poetical Puss whom you would keep in countenance by saying she has once been tolerable and wou'd yet pass Muster by a little licking over it is true that like most vain antiquated Jades which have once been passable yet she affects Youthfulness in her Age and wou'd still gain a few Admirers who the more she seeks or labours for their liking are but more her contemners Nevertheless she is resolv'd henceforth to be so cautious as to appear very little more in the World except it be as an attendant on your Muse or as a Foil not a Rival to her Wit or Fame So that let your Countrygentlewoman appear when she will in the World  This and the following Extract are a full Confutation of the Lying Spirit of  John Dennis  and others who impudently asserted that Mr  Pope  wrote these Verses on himself tho' publish'd by Mr  Wycherley  six Years before his Death We find here it was a voluntary Act of his promis'd beforehand and written while Mr  Pope  was absent The first  Broüillon  of those Verses and the second Copy with Corrections are both yet extant in the  Harley Library  in Mr  Wycherley  's own hand from which will appear that if they received any alteration from Mr  Pope  it was in the Omission of some of his own Praises  my old wornout Jade of a lost Reputation shall be her attendant into it  to procure her Admirers as an old Whore who can get no more Friends of her own bawds for others to make Sport or Pleasure yet one way or other for Mankind I approve of your making  Tonson  your Muse's Introductor into the World or Master of the Ceremonies who has been so long a Pimp or GentlemanUsher to the Muses  I wish you good Fortune since a Man with store of Wit as store of Mony without the help of good Fortune will never be popular but I wish you a great many Admirers which will be some Credit to my Judgment as well as your Wit who always thought you had a great deal and am  Your  c  Extract from two Letters of Mr WYCHERLEY of  May  and of  July    I HAVE made a damn'd Compliment in Verse upon the printing your Pastorals which you shall see when you see meIf you suffer my old Dowdy of a Muse to wait upon your sprightly Lass  of the Plains into the Company of the Town 'twill be but like an old Citybawd's attending a young Country beauty to Town to gain her Admirers when past the Hopes of pleasing the World herself  Mr WYCHERLEY to Mr POPE  May  I MUST thank you for a Book of your Miscellanies which  Tonson  sent me I suppose by your Order and all I can tell you of it is that nothing has lately been better receiv'd by the Publick than your part of it you have only displeas'd the Criticks by pleasing them too well having not left them a Word to say for themselves against you and your performances so that now your hand is in you must persevere 'till my Prophesies of you be fulfill'd In earnest all the best Judges of good Sense or Poetry are Admirers of yours and like your Part of the Book so well that the rest is lik'd the worse This is true upon my word without Compliment so that your first Success will make you for all your Life a Poet in spite of your Wit for a Poet's Success at first  like a Gamester's Fortune at first is like to make him a loser at last and to be undone by his good fortune and merit  But hitherto your Miscellanies have safely run the Gantlet through all the Coffeehouses which are now entertain'd with a whimsical new NewsPaper call'd  The Tatler  which I suppose you have seen This is the newest thing I can tell you of except it be of the Peace which now most People say is drawing to such a Conclusion as all  Europe  is or must be satisfy'd with so Poverty you see which makes Peace in  WestminsterHall  makes it likewise in the Camp or Field throughout the World Peace then be to you and to me who am now grown peaceful and will have no Contest with any Man but him who says he is more your Friend or humble Servant than  Your  c  Mr POPE's Answer  May  I AM glad you receiv'd the  Jacob Tonson  's sixth Vol of  Miscellany Poems  Miscellany  if it were only to show you that there  are as bad Poets in this Nation as your Servant This modern Custom of appearing in Miscellanies is very useful to the Poets who like other Thieves escape by getting into a Crowd and herd together like  Banditti  safe only in their Multitude Methinks  Strada  has given a good Description of these kind of Collections  Nullus hodiè mortalium aut nascitur aut moritur aut praeliatur aut rusticatur aut abit peregrè aut redit aut nubit aut est aut non est nam etiammortuis isti canunt cui non illi extemplò cudant Epicaedia Genethliaca Protreptica Panegyrica Epithalamia Vaticinia Propemptica Soterica Paraenetica Naenias Nugas  As to the success which you say my part has met with it is to be attributed to what you were pleas'd to say of me to the World which you do well to call your  Prophesy  since whatever is said in my favour must be a Prediction of things that are not yet you like a true Godfather engage on my part for much more than ever I can perform My Pastoral Muse like other Country Girls is but put out of Countenance by what you Courtiers say to her yet I hope you would not deceive me too far as knowing that a young Scribler's Vanity needs no Recruits from abroad for Nature like an indulgent Mother kindly takes care to supply  her Sons with as much of their own as is necessary for their Satisfaction If my Verses should meet with a few flying Commendations  Virgil  has taught me that a young Author has not too much reason to be pleas'd with them when he considers that the natural consequence of Praise is Envy and Calumny  Si ultra placitum laudarit Baccare frontent  Cingite ne Vati noceat mala lingua futuro  When once a Man has appear'd as a Poet he may give up his Pretensions to all the rich and thriving Arts Those who have once made their court to those Mistresses without Portions the Muses are never like to set up for Fortunes But for my part I shall be satisfy'd if I can lose my Time agreeably this way without losing my reputation As for gaining any I am as indifferent in the Matter as  Falstaffe  was and may say of  Fame  as he did of  Honour If it comes it comes unlook'd for and there's an end on't  I can be content with a bare saving Game without being thought an Eminent Hand with which Title  Jacob  has graciously dignify'd his adventurers and voluntiers in Poetry  Jacob  creates Poets as Kings sometimes do Knights not for their honour but for money Certainly he  ought to be esteem'd a worker of Miracles who is grown rich by Poetry  What Authors lose their Booksellers have won  So Pimps grow rich while Gallants are undone  I am your  c  Mr WYCHERLEY to Mr POPE  May  THE last I receiv'd from you was dated the d of  May  I take your charitable hint to me very kindly wherein you do like a true Friend and a true Christian and I shall endeavour to follow your Advice as well as your ExampleAs for your wishing to see your Friend an Hermit with you I cannot be said to leave the World since I shall enjoy in your conversation all that I can desire of it nay can learn more from you alone than from my long Experience of the great or little Vulgar in it  As to the Success of your Poems in the late Miscellany I told you of in my last upon my word I made you no Compliment for you may be assur'd that all sorts of Readers like them except they are  Writers too but for them I must needs say the more they like them they ought to be the less pleas'd with 'em So that you do not come off with a bare  Saving Game  as you call it but have gain'd so much Credit at first that you must needs support it to the last Since you set up with so great a Stock of good Sense Judgment and Wit that your Judgment ensures all that your Wit ventures at The Salt of your Wit has been enough to give a relish to the whole insipid HotchPotch it is mingled  The sixth Volume of  Tonson  's Miscellanies  with and you will make  Jacob  's  Ladder  raise you to Immortality by which others are turn'd off shamefully to their Damnation for poetick Thieves as they are who think to be sav'd by others good Works how faulty soever their own are But the Coffeehouse Wits or rather AntiWits the Critics prove their Judgments by approving your Wit and even the NewsMongers and Poets will own you have more Invention than they nay the Detracters or the Envious who never speak well of any body not even of those they think well of in their absence yet will give you even in your absence their good Word and the  Criticks  only hate you  for being forc'd to speak well of you whether they will or no and all this is true upon the word of  Your  c  Mr WYCHERLEY to Mr POPE  Aug  MY Letters so much inferior to yours can only make up their scarcity of Sense by their number of Lines which is like the  Spaniards  paying a debt of Gold with a load of brass Money But to be a Plaindealer I must tell you I will revenge the raillery of your Letters upon mine by printing them as  Dennis  did mine  without your knowledge too  which wou'd be a revenge upon your Judgment for the raillery of your Wit For some dull Rogues that is the most in the World might be such Fools as to think what you said of me was in earnest It is not the first time you great Wits have gain'd Reputation by their paradoxical or ironical Praises your Forefathers have done it  Erasmus  and othersFor all Mankind who know me must confess he must be no ordinary Genius or little Friend who can find out any thing  to commend in me seriously who have given no sign of my Judgment but my Opinion of yours nor mark of my Wit but my leaving off Writing to the publick now you are beginning to shew the World what you can do by yours whose Wit is as spiritual as your Judgment infallible in whose Judgment I have an implicit Faith and shall always subscribe to it to save my Works in this World from the Flames and DamnationPray present my most humble Service to Sir  W Trumbull  for whom and whose Judgment I have so profound a respect that his Example had almost made me marry more than my Nephew's ill Carriage to me having once resolv'd to have reveng'd my self upon him by my Marriage but now am resolv'd to make my revenge greater upon him by his Marriage  Mr WYCHERLEY to Mr POPE  April  I HAVE had yours of the th of the last Month which is kinder than I desire it shou'd be since it tells me you cou'd be better pleas'd to be sick again in Town  in my company than to be well in the Country without it and that you are more impatient to be depriv'd of Happiness than of Health yet my dear Friend set raillery or compliment aside I can bear your absence which procures your Health and Ease better than I can your company when you are in Pain for I cannot see you so without being so too Your love to the Country I do not doubt nor do you I hope my love to it or you since there I can enjoy your company without seeing you in Pain to give me Satisfaction and Pleasure there I can have you without Rivals or Disturbers without the C  s too civil or the T  s too rude without the Noise of the Loud and the Censure of the Silent and wou'd rather have you abuse me there with the Truth than at this distance with your Compliment Since now your business of a Friend and kindness to a Friend is by finding fault with his Faults and mending them by your obliging Severity I hope in point of your good nature you will have no cruel Charity for those Papers of mine you were so willing to be troubled with which I take most infinitely kind of you and shall acknowledge with gratitude as long as I live No Friend can do more for his Friend than preserving his Reputation nay not by preserving his Life  since by preserving his Life he can only make him live about threescore or fourscore Years but by preserving his Reputation he can make him live as long as the World lasts so save him from damning when he is gone to the Devil Therefore I pray condemn me in private as the Thieves do their Accomplices in  Newgate  to save them from condemnation by the Publick Be most kindly unmerciful to my poetical Faults and do with my Papers as you Countrygentlemen do with your Trees slash cut and lopoff the Excrescencies and dead Parts of my wither'd Bays that the little remainder may live the longer and increase the value of them by diminishing the number I have troubled you with my Papers rather to give you Pain than Pleasure notwithstanding your compliment which says you take the trouble kindly Such is the generosity to your Friends that you take it kindly to be desired by them to do them a kindness and you think it done to you when they give you an opportunity to do it to them Wherefore you may be sure to be troubled with my Letters out of Interest if not Kindness since mine to you will procure yours to me so that I write to you more for my own sake than yours less to make you think I write well than to learn from  you to write better Thus you see Interest in my Kindness which is like the Friendship of the World rather to make a Friend than be a Friend but I am yours as a true  Plaindealer  Mr WYCHERLEY to Mr POPE  April  IF I can but do part of my Business at  Shrewsbury  in a Fortnights time which I propose to do I will be soon after with you and trouble you with my Company for the remainder of the Summer In the mean time I beg you to give your self the pains of altering or leaving out what you think superfluous in my Papers that I may endeavour to print such a Number of them as you and I shall think fit about  Michaelmas  next in order to which my dear Friend I beg you to be so kind to me as to be severe to them that the Criticks may be less so for I had rather be condemn'd by my Friend in private than expos'd to my Foes in publick the Criticks or common Judges who are made such by having been old Offenders themselves Pray believe I have as much Faith in your Friendship  and Sincerity as I have Deference to your Judgment and as the best Mark of a Friend is telling his Friend his Faults in private so the next is concealing them from the publick 'till they are fit to appear in the mean time I am not a little sensible of the great kindness you do me in the trouble you take for me in putting my Rhymes in Tune since good Sounds set off often ill Sense as the  Italian  Songs whose good Airs with the worst Words or Meaning make the best Musick so by your tuning my  Welch  Harp my rough Sense may be the less offensive to the nicer Ears of those Criticks who deal more in Sound than Sense Pray then take Pity at once both of my Readers and me in shortning my barren Abundance and increasing their Patience by it as well as the Obligations I have to you and since no Madrigaller can entertain the Head unless he pleases the Ear and since the crowded Opera's have left the best Comedies with the least Audiences 'tis a sign Sound can prevail over Sense therefore soften my Words and strengthen my Sense and  Eris mihi magnus Apollo  Mr WYCHERLEY  Mr WYCHERLEY to Mr POPE  April  YOU give me an account in your Letter of the trouble you have undergone for me in comparing my Papers you took down with you with the old printed Volume and with one another of that Bundle you have in your hands amongst which you say you find numerous  The Truth of this may be seen in the whole printed Volume of his  Miscellanies  in  Folio  in in almost every Page  repetitions of the same Thoughts and Subjects all which I must confess my want of Memory has prevented me from imagining as well as made me capable of committing them since of all Figures that of Tautology is the last I would use or least forgive my self for but seeing is believing wherefore I will take some pains to examine and compare those Papers in your hands with one another as well as with the former printed Copies or Books of my damn'd Miscellanies all which as bad a Memory as I have with a little more pains and care I think I can remedy therefore I would not have you give  your self more trouble about them which may prevent the pleasure you have and may give the World in Writing upon new Subjects of your own whereby you will much better entertain your self and others Now as to your Remarks upon the whole Volume of my Papers all that I desire of you is to mark in the Margin without defacing the Copy at all either any Repetition of Words Matter or Sense or any Thoughts or Words too much repeated which if you will be so kind as to do for me you will supply my  want of Memory  with your good One and my  Deficiencies of Sense  with the Infallibility of yours which if you do you will most infinitely oblige me who almost repent the trouble I have given you since so much Now as to what you call Freedom with me which you desire me to forgive you may be assur'd I would not forgive you unless you did use it for I am so far from thinking your Plainness a Fault or an Offence to me that I think it a Charity and an Obligation which I shall always acknowledge with all sort of Gratitude to you for it who am therefore  Dear Mr  Pope    Your most obliged humble Servant W WYCHERLEY  All the News I have to send you is that poor Mr  Betterton  is going to make his  Exit  from the Stage of this World the Gout being gotten up into his Head and as the Physicians say will certainly carry him off suddenly  Mr POPE's Answer  May  I AM sorry you persist to take ill my not accepting your Invitation and to find if I mistake not your Exception not unmixt with some Suspicion Be certain I shall most carefully observe your Request not to cross over or deface the Copy of your Papers for the future and only to mark in the Margin the Repetitions But as this can serve no further than to get rid of those Repetitions and no way rectify the  Method  nor  connect  the  Matter  nor improve the  Poetry  in  Expression  or  Numbers  without further blotting adding and altering so it really is my opinion and desire that you should take your Papers out of my hands into your own and that no Alterations may be made but when  both of us are present when you may be satisfied with every Blot as well as every Addition and nothing be put upon the Papers but what you shall give your own sanction and assent to at the same time  Do not be so unjust as to imagine from hence that I would decline any part of this Task On the contrary you know I have been at the pains of transcribing some Pieces at once to comply with your desire of not defacing the Copy and yet to lose no Time in proceeding upon the Correction I will go on the same way if you please tho' truly it is as I have often told you my sincere opinion that the greater part would make a much better Figure as  Single Maxims  and  Reflections  in Prose after the manner of your Favourite  Rochefoucant  than in Verse  But little Progress was made in this Design by Mr  Wycherley  thro' his old Age and the increase of his Infirmities He died and was buried in the Vault of St  Paul  's Church  Covent Garden  And this when nothing more is done but marking the Repetitions in the Margin will be an easy Task for your self to proceed upon notwithstanding the bad Memory you complain of  I am unfeignedly  dear Sir  Your  c  LETTERS OF  Of  Abberley  in  Worcestershire  Gentleman of the Horse in Queen  Anne  's reign Author of several beautiful pieces in Prose and Verse and in the Opinion of Mr  Dryden  in his Postscript to  Virgil  the Best Critic of our Nation in his Time  Mr  Walsh  and Mr  Pope  From to  Mr WALSH to Mr WYCHERLEY  Ap  I Return you the  Mr  Pope  's Pastorals  Papers you favour'd me with and had sent them to you yesterday morning but that I thought to have brought them to you last night my self I have read them over several  times with great satisfaction The Preface is very judicious and very learned and the Verses very tender and easy The Author seems to have a particular Genius for that kind of Poetry and a Judgment that much exceeds the years you told me he was of He has taken very freely from the Ancients but what he has mixt of his own with theirs is no way inferior to what he has taken from them 'Tis no flattery at all to say that  Virgil  had written nothing so good at his Age  Sixteen  I shall take it as a favour if you will bring me acquainted with him and if he will give himself the trouble any morning to call at my House I shall be very glad to read the Verses over with him and give him my opinion of the particulars more largely than I can well do in this Letter I am  Sir  Your most faithful and most humble Servant W WALSH  Mr WALSH to Mr POPE  June  I Receiv'd the favour of your Letter and shall be very glad of the continuance of a correspondence by which I am like to be so great a gainer I hope when I have the happiness of seeing you again in  London  not only to read over the Verses I have now of yours but more that you have written since for I make no doubt but any one who writes so well must write more Not that I think the most voluminous Poets always the best I believe the contrary is rather true I mention'd somewhat to you in  London  of a  Pastoral Comedy  which I should be glad to hear you had thought upon since I find  Menage  in his observations upon  Tasso  's  Aminta  reckons up fourscore Pastoral Plays in  Italian  And in looking over my old  Italian  Books I find a great many Pastorals and Piscatory Plays which I suppose  Menage  reckons together I find also by  Menage  that  Tasso  is not the first that writ in that kind he mentioning another before him which he himself had never seen nor indeed have I But as the  Aminta Pastor Fido  and  Filli di Sciro  of  Bonarelli  are the three best so I think there  is no dispute but  Aminta  is the best of the three Not but that the Discourses in  Pastor Fido  are more entertaining and copious in several peoples opinion tho' not so proper for Pastoral and the Fable of  Bonarelli  more surprizing I do not remember many in other Languages that have written in this kind with success  Racan  's  Bergeries  are much inferior to his Lyrick Poems and the  Spaniards  are all too full of Conceits  Rapin  will have the design of Pastoral Plays to be taken from the  Cyclops  of  Euripides  I am sure there is nothing of this kind in  English  worth mentioning and therefore you have that Field open to your self You see I write to you without any sort of constraint or method as things come into my head and therefore pray use the same freedom with me who am c  Mr POPE to Mr WALSH  July  I Cannot omit the first opportunity of making you my acknowledgments for reviewing those Papers of mine You have no less right to correct me than the same hand that rais'd a Tree has to prune it I am convinc'd as well as you that one may  correct too much for in Poetry as in Painting a Man may lay Colours one upon another till they stiffen and deaden the Piece Besides to bestow heightning on every part is monstrous Some parts ought to be lower than the rest and nothing looks more ridiculous than a Work where the Thoughts however different in their own nature seem all on a level 'Tis like a Meadow newly mown where  Weeds Grass  and  Flowers  are all laid even and appear undistinguish'd I believe too that sometimes our first Thoughts are the best as the first squeezing of the Grapes makes the finest and richest Wine  I have not attempted any thing of Pastoral Comedy because I think the Taste of our Age will not relish a Poem of that sort People seek for what they call  Wit  on all subjects and in all places not considering that Nature loves Truth so well that it hardly ever admits of flourishing  Conceit  is to Nature what  Paint  is to Beauty it is not only needless but impairs what it wou'd improve There is a certain Majesty in Simplicity which is far above all the Quaintness of Wit insomuch that the Critics have excluded it from the loftiest Poetry as well as the lowest and forbid it to the Epic no less than the Pastoral I shou'd certainly displease all those who are charm'd  with  Guarini  and  Bonarelli  and imitate  Tasso  not only in the Simplicity of his Thoughts but in that of the  Fable  too If surprising shou'd have place in the story of a Pastoral Comedy I believe it wou'd be more agreeable to Probability to make them the effects of  Chance  than of  Design  Intrigue not being very consistent with that Innocence which ought to constitute a Shepherd's Character There is nothing in all the  Aminta  as I remember but happens by meer accident unless it be the meeting of  Aminta  with  Sylvia  at the  Fountain  which is the contrivance of  Daphne  and even that is the most simple in the world The contrary is observable in  Pastor Fido  where  Corisca  is so perfect a Mistress of Intrigue that the Plot cou'd not have been brought to pass without her I am inclin'd to think the Pastoral Comedy has another disadvantage as to the  Manners  Its general design is to make us in love with the Innocence of a rural Life so that to introduce Shepherds of a vicious Character must in some measure debase it and hence it may come to pass that even the virtuous Characters will not shine so much for want of being oppos'd to their contrariesThese Thoughts are purely my own and therefore I have reason to doubt  them but I hope your Judgment will set me right  I wou'd beg your opinion too as to another point It is how far the liberty of  Borrowing  may extend I have defended it sometimes by saying that it seems not so much the Perfection of Sense to say things that have  never  been said before as to express those  best  that have been said  oftenest  and that Writers in the case of borrowing from others are like Trees which of themselves wou'd produce only one sort of Fruit but by being grafted upon others may yield variety A mutual commerce makes Poetry flourish but then Poets like Merchants shou'd repay with something of their own what they take from others not like Pyrates make prize of all they meet I desire you to tell me sincerely if I have not stretch'd this Licence too far in these Pastorals I hope to become a Critic by your Preceps and a Poet by your Example Since I have seen your Eclogues I cannot be much pleas'd with my own however you have not taken away all my Vanity so long as you give me leave to profess my self  Yours  c  Mr WALSH to Mr POPE  July  I Had sooner return'd you thanks for the favour of your Letter but that I was in hopes of giving you an account at the same time of my Journey to  Windsor  but I am now forc'd to put that quite off being engag'd to go to my Corporation of  Richmond  in  Yorkshire  I think you are perfectly in the right in your Notions of Pastoral but I am of opinion that the redundancy of Wit you mention tho' 'tis what pleases the common people is not what ever pleases the best judges  Pastor Fido  indeed has had more admirers than  Aminta  but I will venture to say there is a great deal of difference between the admirers of one and the other  Corisca  which is a Character generally admir'd by the ordinary judges is intolerable in a Pastorl and  Bonarelli  's fancy of making his Shepherdess in love with two men equally is not to be defended whatever pains he has taken to do it As for what you ask of the  Liberty  of  Borrowing  'tis very evident the best  Latin  Poets have extended this very far and none so far as  Virgil  who is the best  of them As for the  Greek  Poets if we cannot trace them so plainly 'tis perhaps because we have none before them 'tis evident that most of them borrow'd from  Homer  and  Homer  has been accus'd of burning those that wrote before him that his Thefts might not be discover'd The best of the modern Poets in all Languages are those that have the nearest copied the Ancients Indeed in all the common Subjects of Poetry the Thoughts are so obvious at least if they are natural that whoever writes last must write things like what have been said before But they may as well applaud the Ancients for the Arts of eating and drinking and accuse the Moderns of having stol'n those Inventions from them it being evident in all such cases that whoever live first must first find them out 'Tis true indeed when  unus alter Assuitur pannus  when there is one or two bright Thoughts stol'n and all the rest is quite different from it a Poem makes a very foolish figure But when 'tis all melted down together and the Gold of the Antients so mixt with that of the Moderns that none can distinguish the one from the other I can never  find fault with it I cannot however but own to you that there are others of a different opinion and that I have shewn your Verses to some who have made that objection to them I have so much Company round me while I write this and such a noise in my ears that 'tis impossible I should write any thing but Nonsense so must break off abruptly I am Sir  Your most affectionate and most humble Servant  Mr WALSH to Mr POPE  Sept  AT my return from the North I receiv'd the favour of your Letter which had lain there till then Having been absent about six weeks I read over your Pastorals again with a great deal of pleasure and to judge the better read  Virgil  's Eclogues and  Spenser  's Calendar at the same time and I assure you I continue the same opinion I had always of them By the little hints you take upon all occasions to improve them 'tis probable you  will make them yet better against Winter tho' there is a mean to be kept even in that too and a Man may correct his Verses till he takes away the true Spirit of them especially if he submits to the correction of some who pass for great Critics by mechanical Rules and never enter into the true Design and Genius of an Author I have seen some of these that would hardly allow any one good Ode in  Horace  who cry  Virgil  wants fancy and that  Homer  is very incorrect While they talk at this rate one would think them above the common rate of mortals but generally they are great admirers of  Ovid  and  Lucan  and when they write themselves we find out all the Mystery They scan their Verses upon their Fingers run after Conceits and glaring Thoughts their Poems are all made up of Couplets of which the first may be last or the last first without any sort of prejudice to their Works in which there is no Design or Method or any thing Natural or Just For you are certainly in the right that in all Writings whatsoever not Poetry only  Nature  is to be follow'd and we shou'd be jealous of our selves for being sond of  Similes Conceits  and what they call saying  Fine Things  When we werein the North my Lord  Wharton  shew'd  me a Letter he had receiv'd from a certain great  The Earl of  P  General in  Spain  I told him I wou'd by all means have that General recall'd and set to writing here at home for it was impossible that a Man with so much Wit as he shew'd cou'd be fit to command an Army or do any other Business As for what you say of Expression 'tis indeed the same thing to Wit as Dress is to Beauty I have seen many Women overdrest and several look better in a careless Nightgown with their hair about their ears than Mademoiselle  Spanheim  drest for a Ball I do not design to be in  London  till towards the Parliament then I shall certainly be there and hope by that time you will have finisht your Pastorals as you would have them appear in the world and particularly the third of  Autumn  which I have not yet seen Your last Eclogue being upon the same Subject as that of mine on Mrs  Tempest  's Death I shou'd take it very kindly in you to give it a little turn as if it were to the Memory of the same Lady if they were not written for some particular Woman whom you wou'd make immortal You may take occasion to shew the difference between Poets Mistresses and other Men's I only hint this  which you may either do or let alone just as you think fit I shall be very much pleas'd to see you again in Town and to hear from you in the mean time I am with very much esteem  Your  c  Mr POPE to Mr WALSH  Oct  AFter the Thoughts I have already sent you on the subject of  English  Versification you desire my opinion as to some farther particulars There are indeed certain Niceties which tho' not much observed even by correct Versifiers I cannot but think deserve to be better regarded  It is not enough that nothing offends the Ear but a good Poet will adapt the very Sounds as well as Words to the things he treats of So that there is if one may express it so a Style of Sound As in describing a gliding Stream the Numbers shou'd run easy and slowing in describing a rough Torrent or Deluge sonorous and swelling  and so of the rest This is evident every where in  Homer  and  Virgil  and no where else that I know of to any observable degree The following Examples will make this plain which I have taken from  Vida  Molle viam tacito lapsu per levia radit  Incedit tardo molimine subsidendo  Luctantes ventos tempestatesque sonoras  Immenso cum praecipitans ruit Oceano Nox  Telum imbelle sine ictu Conjecit  Tolle moras cape saxa manu cape robora Pastor  Ferte citi flammas data tela repellite pestem  This I think is what very few observe in practice and is undoubtedly of wonderful force in imprinting the image on the reader We have one excellent Example of it in our Language Mr  Dryden  's Ode on St  Caecilia  's Day entitled  Alexander  's  Feast  Every nice Ear must I believe have observ'd that in any smooth  English  Verse of ten syllables there is naturally a  Pause  at the fourth fifth or sixth syllable It is  upon these the Ear rests and upon the judicious Change and Management of which depends the Variety of Versification For example  At the fifth  Wheree'er thy Navy ‖ spreads her canvas Wings  At the fourth  Homage to thee ‖ and Peace to all she brings  At the sixth  Like Tracts of Leverets ‖ in Morning Snow  Now I fancy that to preserve an exact Harmony and Variety the Pauses of the th or th shou'd not be continu'd above three lines together without the Interposition of another else it will be apt to weary the Ear with one continu'd Tone at least it does mine That at the th runs quicker and carries not quite so dead a weight so tires not so much tho' it be continued longer  Another nicety is in relation to  Expletives  whether Words or Syllables which are made use of purely to supply a vacancy  Do  before Verbs plural is absolutely such and it is not improbable but future Refiners may explode  did  and  does  in the same manner which are almost always  used for the sake of Rhime The same Cause has occasioned the promiscuous use of  You  and  Thou  to the same Person which can never sound so graceful as either one or the other  I would also object to the Irruption of  Alexandrine  Verses of twelve syllables which I think should never be allow'd but when some remarkable Beauty or Propriety in them attones for the Liberty Mr  Dryden  has been too free of these especially in his latter Works I am of the same opinion as to  Triple Rhimes  I could equally object to the  Repetition  of the same Rhimes within four or six lines of each other as tiresome to the Ear thro' their Monotony    MonosyllableLines  unless very artfully managed are stiff or languishing but may be beautiful to express Melancholy Slowness or labour  To come to the  Hiatus  or Gap between two words which is caus'd by two Vowels opening on each other upon which you desire me to be particular I think the rule in this case is either to use the  Caesura  or admit the  Hiatus  just as the Ear is least  shock'd by either For the  Caesura  sometimes offends the Ear more than the  Hiatus  itself and our language is naturally overcharg'd with Consonants As for example If in this Verse  The Old have Int'rest ever in their Eye  we should say to avoid the  Hiatus  But th' Old have Int'rest  The  Hiatus  which has the worst effect is when one word ends with the same Vowel that begins the following and next to this those Vowels whose sounds come nearest to each other are most to be avoided O A or U will bear a more full and graceful Sound than E I or Y I know some people will think these Observations trivial and therefore I am glad to corroborate them by some great Authorities which I have met with in  Tully  and  Quintilian  In the fourth Book of Rhetoric to  Herennius  are these words  Fugiemus crebras Vocalium concursiones quae vastam atque hiantem reddunt orationem ut hoc est Baccae aeueae amaenissimae impendebant  And Quintilian  l    cap    Vocalium concursus cum accidit hiat intersistit at quasi laborat oratio Pessimi longè quae easdem inter  se literas committunt sonabunt Praecipuus tamen erit hiatus earum quae cavo aut patulo ore efseruntur Eplenior litera est I anguslior  But he goes on to reprove the excess on the other hand of being too sollicitous in this matter and says admirably  Ne  io an negligentia in hoc aut solicitudo sit pejor  So likewise  Tully Orator ad Brut Theopompum reprehendunt quod eas literas tanto opere fugerit etsi idem magister ejus Isocrates  which last Author as  Turnebus  on  Quintilian  observe has hardly one  Hiatus  in all his Works  Quintilian  tells us that  Tully  and  Demosthenes  did not much observe this Nicety tho'  Tully  himself says in his Orator  Crebra ista Vocum concursio quam magna ex parte vitiosam fugit Demosthenes  If I am not mistaken  Malherbe  of all the Moderns has been the most scrupulous in this point and I think  Menage  in his Observations upon him says he has not one in his Poems To conclude I believe the  Hiatus  should be avoided with more care in Poetry than in Oratory and I would constantly try to prevent it unless where the cutting it off is more prejudicial to the Sound than the  Hiatus  itself  I am  c  Mr  Walsh  died at Years old in the Year The Year after Mr  Pope  writ the  Essay on Criticism  which he concludes with this Gentleman's Elogie  LETTERS TO Several LADIES  LETTER I  Madam  I Send you the book of Rudiments of  Drawing  which you were pleas'd to command and think my self oblig'd to inform you at the same time of one of the many excellencies you possess without knowing of 'em You are but too good a Painter already and no Picture of  Raphael  's was ever so beautiful as that which you have form'd in a certain heart of my acquaintance Indeed it was but just that the  finest lines in nature shou'd be drawn upon the most durable ground and none cou'd ever be met with that wou'd so readily receive or so faithfully retain them as this Heart I may boldly say of it that you will not find its fellow in all the  Parts  of the  Body  in this book But I must complain to you of my hand which is an arrant traitor to my heart for having been copying your picture from thence and from  Kneller  these three days it has done all possible injury to the finest Face that ever was made and to the liveliest Image that ever was drawn I have imagination enough in your absence to trace some resemblance of you but I have been so long us'd to lose my judgment at the sight of you that 'tis past my power to correct it by the life Your Picture seems least like when plac'd before your eyes and contrary to all other pictures receives a manifest disadvantage by being set in the fairest Light in the world The Painters are a very vain generation and have a long time pretended to rival Nature but to own the truth to you she made such a finish'd piece about three and twenty years ago I beg your pardon Madam I protest I meant but two and twenty that 'tis in vain for them any longer to contend with her I know You indeed made one something like it betwixt  five and six years past 'Twas a little girl done with abundance of spirit and life and wants nothing but time to be an admirable piece But not to flatter your work I don't think 'twill ever come up to what your Father made However I wou'd not discourage you 'tis certain you have a strange happiness in making fine things of a sudden and at a stroke with incredible ease and pleasure  Madam  I am  c  LETTER II  IT is too much a rule in this town that when a Lady has once done a man a favour he is to be rude to her ever after It becomes our Sex to take upon us twice as much as yours allow us By this method I may write to you most impudently because you once answer'd me modestly and if you shou'd never do me that honour for the future I am to think like a true Coxcomb that your silence gives consent Perhaps you wonder why this is address'd to you rather than to Mrs  M  with whom I have the right of an old acquaintance whereas you are a  fine Lady have bright eyes  c  First Madam I make choice of you rather than of your Mother because you are younger than your Mother Secondly because I fancy you spell better as having been at school later Thirdly because you have nothing to do but to write if you please and possibly it may keep you from employing your self worse it may save some honest neighbouring Gentleman from three or four of your pestilent glances Cast your eyes upon Paper Madam there you may look innocently Men are seducing books are dangerous the amorous one's soften you and the godly one's give you the spleen If you look upon trees they clasp in embraces birds and beasts make love the Sun is too warm for your blood the Moon melts you into yielding and melancholy Therefore I say once more cast your eyes upon Paper and read only such Letters as I write which convey no darts no flames but proceed from Innocence of soul and simplicity of heart However I can allow you a Bonnet lin'd with green for your eyes but take care you don't tarnish it with ogling too fiercely I am told that hand you shade your self with this shining weather is tann'd pretty much only with being carried over those Eyesthank God I am an hundred miles off from them  Upon the whole I wou'd sooner trust your hand than your Eyes for doing me mischief and tho' I doubt not some part of the rancour and iniquity of your heart will drop into your pen yet since it will not attack me on a sudden and unprepar'd since I may have time while I break open your letter to cross my self and say a  Paternoster  I hope Providence will protect me from all you can attempt at this distance Mr  B  tells me you are at this hour as handsome as an Angel for my part I have forgot your face since two winters I don't know whether you are tall or short nor call tell in any respect what sort of creature you are only that you are a very mischievous one whom I shall ever pray to be defended from But when Mr  B  sends me word you have the smallpox a good many freckles or are very pale I will desire him to give thanks for it in your Parish Church which as soon as he shall inform me he has done I will make you a visit atwithout Armour I will eat any thing you give me without suspicion of poyson take you by the hand without gloves nay venture to follow you into an arbour without calling the company This Madam is the top of my wishes but how differently are our desires inclined You sigh out in the ardour of  your heart Oh Playhouses Parks Opera's Assemblies  London  I cry with rapture Oh Woods Gardens Rookeries Fishponds Arbours Mrs  Betty M  LETTER III  To a Lady written on the opposite pages of a Letter to her Husband from Lady  M  THE Wits would say that this must needs be a dull Letter because it is a marry'd one I am afraid indeed you will find what Spirit there is must be on the side of the Wife and the Husband's part as usual will prove the dullest What an unequal Pair are put together in this sheet in which tho' we sin it is you must do penance When you look on both sides of this paper you may fancy that our words according to a Scripture expression are as a  Twoedg'd Sword  whereof Lady  M  is the shining blade and I only the Handle But I can't proceed without so far mortifying Sir  Robert  as to tell him that she writes this purely in obedience to  me and that it is but one of those honours a Husband receives for the sake of his Wife  It is making court ill to one fine Woman to shew her the regard we have for another and yet I must own there is not a period of this Epistle but squints toward another overagainst it It will be in vain to dissemble Your penetrating Eyes cannot but discover how all the letters that compose these words lean forward after Lady  M  's letters which seem to bend as much from mine and fly from them as fast as they are able Ungrateful letters that they are which give themselves to another man in the very presence of him who will yield to no mortal in knowing how to value them  You will think I forget my self and am not writing to you but let me tell you 'tis you forget your self in that thought for you are almost the only Woman to whom one can safely address the praises of another Besides can you imagine a Man of my importance so stupid as to say fine things to you before your Husband Let us see how far Lady  M  her self dares do any thing like it with all the wit and address she is mistress of If Sir  Robert  can be so ignorant now he is left to himself in the country to imagine any such matter let him know from me that here in town  every thing that Lady says is taken for Satire For my part every body knows it is my constant practice to speak Truth and I never do it more than when I call my self  Your  c  LETTER IV  To a Lady in the Name of her Brother  IF you have not a chaste ear and a pure heart do not peruse this Letter for as  Jeremy Taylor  says in his  holy living and dying  the first thing a Virgin ought to endeavour is to be ignorant of the  distinction  of  Sexes  It is in the confidence I have that you are thus innocent that I endeavour to gratify your curiosity in a point in which I am sensible none but a Brother could do it with decency  I shall entertain you with the most reigning Curiosity in the town I mean a Person who is equally the toast of gentlemen and ladies and is at present more universally admired than any of either Sex You know  few proficients have a greater genius for Monsters than my self but I never tasted a monster to that degree I have done this creature It was not like other monsters produced in the Desarts of  Arabia  nor came from the country of the  Great Mogul  but is the production of the jointendeavours of a  Kentish  Parson and his Spouse who intended in the singleness of heart to have begot a christian but of one sex and providence has sent them one of two  There are various opinions concerning this Creature about town Mr  Cromwell  observes that the Age is very licentious and the present Reign very lewd and corrupt in permitting a Lady  by Authoriy  as appears by the printed bills to expose her personal curiosities for a shilling  Mr  P  looks upon it as a Prodigy portending some great Revolution in the State to strengthen which opinion he produces the following Prophecy of  Nostradamus  which he explains politically  When as two Sexes join'd in One  Shall in the Realm of  Brute  be shown  Then Factions shall unite if I know  To choose a Prince  Jure Divino  This prodigy of common Gender  Is neither Sex but a Pretender  So the Lord shield the Faith's Defender  Mrs  N  admires what people wonder at so much and says she is just so her self The Duchess of  S  is of the same opinion  Among these various conjectures that I might be informed of the truth I took along with me a Physician and a Divine the one to inspect the state of its Body the other to examine that of its Mind The persons I made choice of were the ingenious Dr  P  and the reverend Mr  We were no sooner in the room but the Party came to us drest in that habit in which the Ladies affect an Hermophroditical imitation of Menyour sharp wit my dear Sister will immediately conclude that I mean a Ridinghabit  I think it not material to inform you whether the Doctor the Divine or my self look'd first The Priest you will maliciously fancy was in his nature most an Infidel and doubted most of this Miracle we therefore propos'd to him to take the surest method of believing seeing and feeling He comply'd with both admonitions and having taken a large pinch of snuff upon it advis'd us with a nod that we should by no means regard it as a Female but as a Male for by so doing we should be guilty of less sinfulness  The Doctor upon inspection differ'd from this opinion he wou'd by no means allow it a miracle or at most a natural one He said upon the whole it was a woman that whatever might give a handle to think otherwise was a trifle nothing being more common than for a child to be mark'd with that thing which the mother long'd for  As for this Party's temper of mind it appears to be a most even disposition partaking of the good qualities of both sexes for she is neither so inaccessible as other Ladies nor is he so impudent as other Gentlemen Of how obliging and complaisant a turn appears by this that he tells the Ladies he has the Inclinations of a Gentleman and that she tells the Gentlemen she has the  Tendre  of a Lady As a further proof of this affable disposition he formerly receiv'd visits of the fair sex in their masques till an impertinent fellow in a female disguise mingled with a party of ladies and impudently overheard their improving Speculations  Notwithstanding this she civilly promised at my request that my two sisters should be admitted privately whenever you wou'd do her the honour of your consideration  How agreeable soever this sight has been to me I assure you it cannot be so pleasing as the sight of you in town and whatever you may see in the country I dare affirm no man or woman can shew you the like  I therefore earnestly desire you to make haste to this place for tho' indeed like most other brothers I should be sorry you were married at my expence yet I would by no means like them detain you in the country from your admirers for you may believe me no brother in the world ever lov'd a sister as I do you  I am  c  LETTER V  Bath    YOU are to understand Madam that my passion for your fair self and your sister has been divided with the most wonderful regularity in the world Even from my infancy I have been in love with one after the other of you week by week and my journey to  Bath  fell out in the three hundred seventy sixth week of the Reign of my Sovereign Lady  Sylvia  At the  present writing hereof it is the three hundred eighty ninth week of the Reign of your most Serene Majesty in whose service I was listed some weeks before I beheld your Sister This information will account for my writing to either of you hereafter as either shall happen to be QueenRegent at that time  Pray tell your sister all the good qualities and virtuous inclinations she has never gave me so much pleasure in her conversation as that one vice of her obstinacy will give me mortification this month  Ratcliff  commands her to the  Bath  and she refuses indeed if I were in  Berkshire  I should honour her for this obstinacy and magnisy her no less for disobedience than we do the  Barcelonians  But people change with the change of places as we see of late and virtues become vices when they cease to be for one's interest with me as with others  Yet let me tell her she will never look so finely while she is upon earth as she would here in the water It is not here as in most other instances for those Ladies that would please extremely must go  out  of their own element She does not make half so good a figure on horseback as  Christina  Queen of  Sweden  but were she once seen in the Bath no man wou'd part with  her for the best Mermaid in christendom You know I have seen you often I perfectly know how you look in black and in white I have experienc'd the utmost you can do in colours but all your movements all your graceful steps deserve not half the glory you might here attain of a moving and easy behaviour in  Buckram  Something between swimming and walking free enough and more modestlyhalfnaked than you can appear any where else You have conquer'd enough already by land show your ambition and vanquish also by water We have no pretty Admirals on these Seas but must strike sails to your white Flags were they once hoisted up The Buckram I mention is a dress particularly useful at this time when we are told the Princess is bringing over the fashion of  German  Ruffs You ought to use your selves to some degrees of stiffness beforehand And when our Ladies chins have been tickled awhile with starch'd muslin and wire they may possibly bear the brush of a  German  beard and whisker  I cou'd tell you a delightful story of Dr  P  but want room to display it in all its shining circumstances He had heard it was an excellent cure for Love to kiss the Aunt of the person beloved who is generally of years and experience enough to  damp the fiercest flame he try'd this course in his passion and kiss'd Mrs  E  at Mr  D  's but he says it will not do and that he loves you as much as ever  Yours  c  LETTER VI  To the same  IF you ask how the waters agree with me I must tell you so very well that I question how you and I should agree if we were in a room by our selves Mrs  T  has honestly assured me that but for some whims which she can't entirely conquer she would go and see the world with me in man's cloaths Even you  Madam  I fancy if you wou'd not partake in our adventures would wait our coming in at the evening with some impatience and be well enough pleas'd to hear 'em by the fireside That would be better than reading Romances unless Lady  M  would be our Historian for as she is married she has probably leisure hours in the nighttime to write or do what she will in What raises these desires in me is an acquaintance I am beginning  with my Lady  Sandwich  who has all the spirit of the last age and all the gay experience of a pleasurable life It were as scandalous an omission to come to the  Bath  and not to see my Lady  Sandwich  as it had formerly been to have travell'd to  Rome  without visiting the Queen of  Sweeden  She is in a word the best thing this Country has to boast of and as she has been all that a woman of spirit could be so she still continues that easy and independent creature that a sensible woman always will be  I must tell you a truth which is not however much to my credit I never thought so must of your self and your sister as since I have been fourscore miles distance from you In the Forest I look'd upon you as good neighbours at  London  as pretty kind of women but here as divinities angels goddesses or what you will In the same manner I never knew at what a rate I valu'd your life till you were upon the point of dying If Mrs  T  and you will but fall very sick every season I shall certainly die for you Seriously I value you both so much that I esteem others much the less for your sakes you have robb'd me of the pleasure of esteeming a thousand pretty qualities in them by showing me so many finer in  your selves There are but two things in the world which could make you indifferent to me which I believe you are not capable of I mean Illnature and malice I have seen enough of you not to overlook any Frailty you cou'd have and nothing less than a Vice can make me like you less I expect you shou'd discover by my conduct towards you both that this is true and that therefore you should pardon a thousand things in me for that one disposition Expect nothing from me but truths and freedom and I shall always be thought by you what I always am  Yours  c  LETTER VII  To the same  I Return'd home as slow and as contemplative after I had parted from you as my Lordretir'd from the Court and Glory to his Country seat and Wife a week ago I found here a dismal desponding letter from the son of another  great Courtier who expects the same fate and who tells me the great one's of the earth will now take it very kindly of the mean one's if they will favour them with a visit by Daylight With what Joy wou'd they lay down all their schemes of glory did they but know you have the generosity to drink their healths once a day as soon as they are fallen Thus the unhappy by the sole merit of their misfortunes become the care of heaven and you I intended to have put this last into Verse but in this age of Ingratitude my best friends forsake me I mean my rhymes  I desire Mrs  P  to stay her stomach with these half hundred Plays till I can procure her a Romance big enough to satisfy her great Soul with Adventures As for Novels I fear she can depend upon none from me but That of  my Life  which I am still as I have been contriving all possible methods to shorten for the greater ease both of my Historian and the Reader May she believe all the passion and tenderness express'd in these Romances to be but a faint image of what I bear her and may you who read nothing take the same truth upon hearing it from me you will both injure me very much if you don't think me a truer friend than ever any romantick  lover or any imitator of their style could be  The days of Beauty are as the days of Greatness and as long as your Eyes make their sunshine all the world are your adorers I am one of those unambitious people who will love you forty years hence when your eyes begin to twinkle in a retirement for your own sakes and without the vanity which every one now will take to be thought  Your  c  LETTER VIII  YOU have ask'd me News a hundred times at the first word you spoke to me which some would interpret as if you expected nothing better from my lips And truly 'tis not a sign two Lovers are together when they can be so impertinent as to enquire what the world does All I mean by this is that either you or I are not in love with the other I leave you to guess which of the two is that stupid and insensible creature so blind to the other's excellencies and charms  This then shall be a letter of News and sure if you did not think me the humblest creature in the world you could never imagine a Poet could dwindle to a brother of  Dawks  and  Dyer  from a rival of  Tate  and  Brady  The Earl of  Oxford  has behaved so bravely that in this act at least he might seem above Man if he had not just now voided a Stone to prove him subject to human infirmities The utmost weight of affliction from princely power and popular hatred were almost worth bearing for the glory of such a dauntless conduct as he has shewn under it  You may soon have your wish to enjoy the gallant sights of armies incampments standards waving over your brother's cornfields and the pretty windings of the  Thames  about  M  stain'd with the blood of men Your barbarity which I have heard so long exclaim'd against in town and country may have its fill of destruction I would not add one circumstance usual in all descriptions of calamity that of the many Rapes committed or to be committed upon those unfortunate women that  delight in war  But God forgive mein this martial age if I could I would buy a regiment for your sake and Mrs  P  's and some others whom I have  cause to fear no fair means will prevail upon  Those eyes that care not how much mischief is done or how great slaughter committed so they have but a fine Show those veryfemale eyes will be infinitely delighted with the camp which is speedily to be form'd in  HydePark  The tents are carried thither this morning new regiments with new cloths and furniture far exceeding the late cloth and linnen design'd by his  Grace  for the soldiery The sight of so many gallant fellows with all the pomp and glare of War yet undeform'd by Battle those Scenes which  England  has for many years only beheld on Stages may possibly invite your curiosity to this place  Mrs  expects the Pretender at her lodgings by  Saturday  se'nnight She has bought a picture of Madam  Maintenon  to set her features by against that time Three Priests of your acquaintance are very positive by her interest to be his Father Confessor  By our latest accounts from  Dukestreet Westminster  the conversion of  T G  Esq  is reported in a manner somewhat more particular That upon the seizure of his  FlandersMares  he seem'd more than ordinarily disturb'd for some hours sent for his ghostly father and resolv'd to bear his  loss like a Christian till about the hours of seven or eight the coaches and horses of several of the Nobility passing by the window towards  HydePark  he could no longer endure the disapointment but instantly went out took the Oath of Abjuration and recover'd his dear Horses which carry'd him in triumph to the  Ring  The poor distressed  Roman Catholicks  now unhors'd and uncharioted cry out with the Psalmist  some in Chariots and some in Horses but we will invocate the name of the Lord  I am  c  LETTER IX  I Will not describe  Bl  in particular not to forestall your expectations before you see it Only take a short account which I will hazard my little credit is no unjust one I never saw so great a thing with so much littleness in it I think the Architect built it entirely in compliance to the taste of its Owners For it is the most inhospitable thing imaginable and the most selfish it has like their own hearts no room for strangers and no reception for any person of superior quality to themselves There are but two Apartments for  the Master and Mistress below and but two apartments above very much inferior to them in the whole House When you look upon the outside you'd think it large enough for a Prince when you see the inside it is too little for a Subject and has not conveniency to lodge a common family It is a house of Entries and Passages among which there are three Vista's through the whole very uselessly handsome There is what might have been a fine Gallery but spoil'd by two Arches towards the End of it which take away the sight of several of the windows There are two ordinary staircases instead of one great one The best things within the house are the Hall which is indeed noble and wellproportion'd and the cellars and offices underground which are the most commodious and the best contrived of the whole At the top of the Building are several Cupola's and little Turrets that have but an ill effect and make the building look at once finical and heavy What seems of the best taste is that Front towards the gardens which is not yet loaded with these turrets The two Sides of the building are intirely spoil'd by two monstrous bowwindows which stand just in the middle instead of doors And as if it were fatal  that some trifling littleness should every where destroy the grandeur there are in the chief front two semicircles of a lower structure than the rest that cut off the arges and look as it they were purposely design'd to hide a lostier and nobler piece of building the top of which appears above them In a word the whole is a most expensive absurdity and the Duke of  S  gave a true character of it when he said it was a great  Quarry of Stones above ground  We paid a visit to the spring where  Rosamond  bathed her self on a hill where remains only a piece of a wall of the old Palace of  Henry  the Second We toasted her shade in the cold water not without a thought or two scarce so cold as the liquor we drank it in I dare not tell you what they were and so hasten to conclude  Your  c  LETTER X  YOU can't be surprized to find him a dull correspondent whom you have known so long for a dull companion And tho' I am pretty sensible that it I have any wit I may as well write to show  it as not because any Lady that has once seen me will naturally ask what I can show that is better yet I'll content my self with giving you as plain a history of my pilgrimage as  Purchas  himself or as  John Bunyan  could do of his  walking through the wilderness of this world  c  First then I went by water to  HamptonCourt  unattended by all but my own virtues which were not of so modest a nature as to keep themselves or me conceal'd For I met the Prince with all his Ladies on horseback coming from hunting Mrs  B  and Mrs  L  took me into protection contrary to the laws against harbouring Papists and gave me a dinner with something I lik'd better an opportunity of conversation with Mrs  H  We all agreed that the life of a Maid of Honour was of all things the most miserable and wish'd that every woman who envy'd it had a specimen of it To eat  Westphalia  Ham in a morning ride over hedges and ditches on borrow'd Hacks come home in the heat of the day with a fever and what is worse a hundred times with a red mark in the forehead from an uneasy hat all this may qualify them to make excellent wives for Foxhunters and bear abundance of ruddycomplexion'd  children As soon as they can wipe off the sweat of the day they must simper an hour and catch cold in the Princess's apartment from thence as  Shakespear  has it  To dinner with what appetite they may  and after that 'till midnight walk work or think which they please I can easily believe no lonehouse in  Wales  with a Mountain and a Rookery is more contemplative than this Court and as a proof of it I need only tell you Mrs  L  walk'd all alone with me three or four Hours by moonlight and we met no creature of any Quality but the King who gave audience to the ViceChamberlain all alone under the garden wall  In short I heard of no Ball Assembly BassetTable or any place where two or three were gathered together except Madam  Kilmansegg  's to which I had the honour to be invited and the grace to stay away  I was heartily tired and posted to  B  Park there we had an excellent Discourse of Quackery Dr  Shadwell  was mentioned with honour Lady  A  walked a whole hour abroad without dying after it at least in the time I stay'd tho' she seemed to be fainting and had convulsive motions several times in her head  This day I received a Letter with certain advices were women were to be met with at  Oxford  I defy them and all their works I love no meat but Ortolans and no women but you tho' indeed that's no proper comparison but for fat Duchess's for to love You is as if one should wish to eat Angels or to drink Cherubimbroth  I arriv'd in the forest by  Tuesday  noon having fled from the face I wish I could say the horned face of  Moles B  who dined in the midway thither I past the rest of the day in those Woods where I have so often enjoyed a Book and a Friend I made a Hymn as I passed thro' which ended with a sigh that I will not tell you the meaning of  Your Doctor is gone the way of all his patients and was hard put to it how to dispose of an estate miserably unweildy and splendidly unuseful to him Sir  Samuel Garth  says that for  Ratcliffe  to leave a Library was as if a Eunuch should found a Seraglio Dr  Sh  lately told a Lady he wonder'd she could be alive after him she made answer She wonder'd at it for two reasons because Dr  Ratcliffe  was dead and because Dr  Sh  was living I am  Your  c  LETTER XI  To the Same  NOthing could have more of that melancholy which once used to please me than my last days journey for after having pass'd through my favorite Woods in the forest with a thousand Reveries of past pleasures I rid over hanging hills whose tops were edg'd with groves and whose feet water'd with winding rivers listning to the falls of cataracts below and the murmuring of the winds above The gloomy verdure of  Stonor  succeeded to these and then the shades of the evening overtook me The Moon rose in the clearest sky I ever saw by whose solemn light I paced on slowly without company or any interruption to the range of my thoughts About a mile before I reach'd  Oxford  all the bells toll'd in different notes the clocks of every college answered one another and sounded forth some in a deeper some in a softer tone that it was eleven at night All this was no ill preparation to the life I have led since among those old walls venerable galleries stone portico's studious walks  and solitary scenes of the University I wanted nothing but a black gown and a salary to be as meer a bookworm as any there I conform'd myself to the College hours was roll'd up in books lay in one of the most antient dusky parts of the University and was as dead to the world as any Hermit of the desart If any thing was alive or a wake in me it was a little vanity such as even those good men us'd to entertain when the Monks  of their own Order  extoll'd their piety and abstraction For I found my self receiv'd with a sort of respect which this idle part of mankind the learned pay to their own species who are as considerable here as the busy the gay and the ambitious are in your world  Indeed I was treated in such a manner that I could not but sometimes ask my self in my mind what College I was founder of or what Library I had built Methinks I do very ill to return to the world again to leave the only place where I make a figure and from seeing my self seated with dignity in the most conspicuous shelves of a library put myself into the abject posture of lying at a Lady's feet in St  James  's square  I will not deny but that like  Alexander  in the midst of my glory I am wounded and find myself a meer man To tell you  from whence the dart comes is to no purpose since neither of you will take the tender care to draw it out of my heart and suck the poison with your lips  Here at my Lord  H  's I see a creature nearer an angel than a woman tho' a woman be very near as good as an angel I think you have formerly heard me mention Mrs  T  as a credit to the Maker of Angels she is a relation of his Lordship's and he gravely propos'd her to me for a Wife being tender of her Interests and knowing what is a shame to Providence that she is less indebted to Fortune than I I told him 'twas what he could never have thought of if it had not been his misfortune to be blind and what I never could think of while I had eyes to see both her and myself  I must not conclude without telling you that I will do the utmost in the affair you desire It would be an inexpressible joy to me if I could serve you and I will always do all I can to give my self pleasure I wish as well for you as for my self I am in love with you both as much as I am with my self for I find my self most so with all three when I least suspect it  I am  c  LETTER XII  To Mrs  Arabella Fermor  on her Marriage  YOU are by this time satisfy'd how much the tenderness of one man of merit is to be prefer'd to the addresses of a thousand And by this time the Gentleman you have made choice of is sensible how great is the joy of having all those charms and good qualities which have pleas'd so many now apply'd to please one only It was but just that the same Virtues which gave you reputation should give you happiness and I can wish you no greater than that you may receive it in as high a degree your self as so much good humour must infallibly give it to your husband  It may be expected perhaps that one who has the title of Poet should say something more polite on this occasion But I am really more a wellwisher to your felicity than a celebrater of your beauty Besides you are now a married woman and in a way to be a great many better things than a fine Lady such as an excellent wife a faithful friend a tender parent and at  last as the consequence of them all a saint in heaven You ought now to hear nothing but that which was all you ever desired to hear whatever others may have spoken to you I mean  Truth  And it is with the utmost that I assure you no friend you have can more rejoice in any good that befalls you is more sincerely delighted with the prospect of your future happiness or more unfeignedly desires a long continuance of it I beg you will think it but just that a man who will certainly be spoken of as your admirer after he is dead may have the happiness to be esteem'd while he is living  Your  c  LETTER XIII  THE chief cause I have to repent my leaving the town is the uncertainty I am in every day of your Sister's state of health I really expected by every post to have heard of her recovery but on the contrary each letter has been a new awakening to my apprehensions and I have ever since suffer'd allarms upon allarms on her account No one can be more sensibly touch'd at this than I  nor any danger of any I love cou'd affect me with more uneasiness tho' as I never had a sister I can't be quite so good a judge as you how far humanity wou'd carry me I have felt some weaknesses of a tender kind which I would not be free from and I am glad to find my value for people so rightly plac'd as to perceive them on this occasion  I cannot be so good a Christian as to be willing tho' no less than God should order it to resign my own happiness here for her's in another life I do more than wish for her safety for every wish I make I find immediately chang'd into a prayer and a more fervent one than I had learn'd to make till now  May her Life be longer and happier than perhaps her self may desire that is as long and as happy as your self can wish May her Beauty be as great as possible that is as it always was or as yours is but whatever ravages a merciless distemper may commit I dare promise her boldly what few if any of her makers of visits and complements dare to do she shall have one man as much her admirer as ever As for your part Madam you have me so more than ever since I have been a witness to the generous tenderness you have shewn upon this occasion  Your  c  LETTER XIV  IT is with infinite satisfaction I am made acquainted that your brother will at last prove your relation and has entertain'd such sentiments as become him in your concern I have been prepar'd for this by degrees having several times receiv'd from Mrs  that which is one of the greatest pleasures the knowledge that others enter'd into my own sentiments concerning you I ever was of opinion that you wanted no more to be vindicated than to be known and like Truth cou'd appear no where but you must conquer As I have often condol'd with you in your adversities so I have a right which but few can pretend to of congratulating on the prospect of your better fortunes and I hope for the future to have the concern I have felt for you overpaid in your felicities Tho' you modestly say the world has left you yet I verily believe it is coming to you again as fast as it can For to give the world its due it is always very fond of Merit when 'tis past its power to oppose it Therefore if you should take it into favour again upon its repentance and continue in it you would be so far from  leading what is commonly call'd an unsettled life and what you with too much unjust severity call a vagabond Life that the wise cou'd only look upon you as a Prince in a progress who travels to gain the affections he has not or to fix those he already has which he effectually does wherever he shews himself But if you are resolv'd in revenge to rob the world of so much example as you may afford it I believe your design will be vain for even in a Monastery your devotions cannot carry you so far towards the next world as to make This lose the sight of you but you'll be like a Star that while it is fix'd to Heaven shines over all the Earth  Wheresoever Providence shall dispose of the most valuable thing I know I shall ever follow you with my sincerest wishes and my best thoughts will be perpetually waiting upon you when you never hear of me or them Your own guardian Angels cannot be more constant nor more silent I beg you will never cease to think me your friend that you may not be guilty of that which you never yet knew to commit an Injustice As I have hitherto been so in spite of the world so hereafter if it be possible you shou'd ever be more opposed and more deserted I should only be so much the more  Your faithful  c  LETTER XV  I Can say little to recommend the Letters I shall write to you but that they will be the most impartial representations of a free heart and the truest copies you ever saw tho' of a very mean original Not a feature will be soften'd or any advantageous light employ'd to make the ugly thing a little less hideous but you shall find it in all respects most horribly like You will do me an injustice if you look upon any thing I shall say from this instant as a compliment either to you or my self Whatever I write will be the real thought of that hour and I know you'll no more expect it of me to persevere till death in every sentiment or notion I now set down than you would imagine a man's face should never change when once his picture was drawn  The freedom I shall use in this manner of  thinking aloud  may indeed prove me a fool but it will prove me one of the best sort of fools the honest ones And since what folly we have will infallibly buoy up at one time or other in spight of all our art to keep it down methinks 'tis almost foolish to take any pains to conceal it at  all and almost knavish to do it from those that are our friends If  Momus  's project had taken of having windows in our breasts I shou'd be for carrying it further and making those windows casements that while a man show'd his heart to all the world he might do something more for his friends even give it them and trust it to their handling I think I love you as well as King  Herod  did  Herodias  tho' I never had so much as one dance with you and would as freely give you my heart in a dish as he did another's head But since  Jupiter  will not have it so I must be content to shew my taste in life as I do my taste in painting by loving to have as little drapery as possible Not that I think every body naked altogether so fine a sight as your self and a few more would be but because 'tis good to use people to what they must be acquainted with and there will certainly come some day of judgment or other to uncover every soul of us We shall then see that the  Prues  of this world ow'd all their fine figure only to their being straterlac'd than the rest and that they are naturally as arrant Squabs as those that never girded their loins at allBut a particular reason that may engage you to write your thoughts the more freely to me is that I am confident no one  knows you better for I find when others express their thoughts of you they fall very short of mine and I know at the same time theirs are such as you would think sufficient in your favour  You may easily imagine how desirous I must be of a correspondence with a person who had taught me long ago that it was as possible to esteem at first sight as to love and who has since ruin'd me for all the conversation of one sex and almost all the friendship of the other I am but too sensible thro' your means that the company of men wants a certain softness to recommend it and that of women wants every thing else How often have I been quietly going to take possession of that tranquillity and indolence I had so long found in the country when one evening of your conversation has spoil'd me for a  Solitaire  Books have lost their effect upon me and I was convinced since I saw you that there is one alive wiser than all the Sages a plague of female wisdom it makes a man ten times more uneasy than his own What is very strange Virtue herself when you have the dressing her is too amiable for one's repose You might have done a world of good in your time if you had allow'd half the fine gentlemen who have seen you to have conversed with you they  would have been strangely bit while they thought only to fall in love with a fair Lady and you had bewitch'd them with Reason and Virtue two Beauties that the very Fops pretend to have no acquaintance with  The unhappy distance at which we correspond removes a great many of those restrictions and punctilious decorums that oftentimes in nearer conversation prejudice truth to save good breeding I may now hear of my faults and you of your good qualities without a blush we converse upon such unfortunate generous terms as exclude the regards of fear shame or design in either of us And methinks it would be as paltry a part to impose even in a single thought upon each other in this state of separation as for Spirits of a different sphere who have so little intercourse with us to employ that little as some would make us think they do in putting tricks and delusions upon poor mortals  Let me begin then Madam by asking you a question that may enable me to judge better of my own conduct than most instances of my Life In what manner did I behave the last hour I saw you What degree of concern did I discover when I felt a misfortune which I hope you will  never feel that of parting from what one most esteems for if my parting looked but like that of your common acquaintance I am the greatest of all the hypocrites that ever decency made  I never since pass by your house but with the same sort of melancholy that we feel upon seeing the Tomb of a friend which only serves to put us in mind of what we have lost I reflect upon the circumstances of your departure which I was there a witness of your behaviour in what I may call your last moments and I indulge a gloomy kind of pleasure in thinking that those last moments were given to me I would fain imagine this was not accidental but proceeded from a penetration which I know you have in finding out the truth of people's sentiments and that you were willing the last man that  would have  parted from you should be that last that  did  I really look'd upon you just as the friends of  Curtius  might have done upon that Hero at the instant when he was devoting himself to Glory and running to be lost out of generosity I was obliged to admire your resolution in as great a degree as I deplored it and had only to wish that Heaven would reward so much Virtue as was to be taken from us with all the felicities it could enjoy elsewhere  I am  c  LETTER XVI  YOU will find me more troublesome than ever  Brutus  did his Evil Genius I shall meet you in more places than one and often refresh your memory before you arrive at your  Philippi  These shadows of me my letters will be haunting you from time to time and putting you in mind of the man who has really suffer'd very much from you and whom you have robb'd of the most valuable of his enjoyments your conversation The advantage of hearing your sentiments by discovering mine was what I always thought a great one and even worth the risque I generally run of manifesting my own indiscretion You then rewarded my trust in you the moment it was given for you pleas'd or inform'd me the minute you answer'd I must now be contented with more slow returns However 'tis some pleasure that your thoughts upon Paper will be a more lasting possession to me and that I shall no longer have cause to complain of a loss I have so often regretted that of any  thing you said which I happen'd to forget In earnest Madam if I were to write to you as often as I think of you it must be every day of my life I attend you in spirit through all your ways I follow you thro' every stage in books of travels and fear for you thro' whole folio's you make me shrink at the past dangers of dead travellers and if I read of a delightful prospect or agreeable place I hope it yet subsists to please you I enquire the roads the amusements the company of every town and country thro' which you pass with as much diligence as if I were to set out next week to overtake you In a word no one can have you more constantly in mind not even your guardian Angel if you have one and I am willing to indulge so much Popery as to fancy some Being takes care of you who knows your value better than you do your self I am willing to think that Heaven never gave so much selfneglect and resolution to a woman to occasion her calamity but am pious enough to believe those qualities must be intended to conduce to her benefit and her glory  Your first short letter only serves to show me you are alive it puts me in mind of the first Dove that return'd to  Noah  and just made him know it had found no rest abroad  There is nothing in it that pleases me but when you tell me you had no Seasickness I beg your next may give me all the pleasure it can that is tell me any that you receive You can make no discoveries that will be half so valuable to me as those of your own mind Nothing that regards the States or Kingdoms you pass through will engage so much of my curiosity or concern as what relates to yourself Your welfare to say truth is more at my heart than that of  Christendom  I am sure I may defend the truth though perhaps not the virtue of this declaration One is ignorant or doubtful at best of the merits of differing religions and governments but private virtues one can be sure of I therefore know what particular person has desert enough to merit being happier than others but not what nation deserves to conquer or oppress another You will say I am not  Publickspirited  let it be so I may have too many tendernesses particularly regards or narrow views but at the same time I am certain that whoever wants these  can never have a  Publickspirit  for as a friend of mine says how is it possible for that man to love twenty thousand people who never loved one  I communicated your letter to Mr  C  he thinks of you and talks of you as he ought I mean as I do and one always thinks that to be just as it ought His health and mine are now so good that we wish with all our souls you were a witness of it We never meet but we lament over you we pay a kind of weekly rites to your memory where we strow flowers of rhetorick and offer such libations to your name as it would be prophane to call  Toasting  The Duke of  B  m  is sometimes the High Priest of your praises and upon the whole I believe there are as few Men that are not sorry at your departure as Women that are for you know most of your Sex want good sense and therefore must want generosity You have so much of both that I am sure you pardon them for one cannot but forgive whatever one despises For my part I hate a great many women for your sake and undervalue all the rest 'Tis you are to blame and may God revenge it upon you with all  those blessings and earthly prosperities which the Divines tell us are the cause of our Perdition for if he makes you happy in this world I dare trust your own virtue to do it in the other I am  Your  c  LETTERS To the Honourable ROBERT DIGBY From Mr POPE  To the Honourable  Robert Digby  Chiswick  Jan  Dear Sir  I Had pleas'd myself sooner in writing to you but that I have been your Successor in a Fit of Sickness and am not yet so much recovered but that I have thoughts of using your  Asses  Physicians They are as grave Persons as any of the Faculty and like the Antients carry their own Medicaments about with them But indeed the Moderns are such Lovers of Raillery that nothing is grave enough to escape them Let 'em laugh but People will still have their Opinions As they think our Doctors Asses to them we'll think them Asses to our Doctors  I am glad you are so much in a better State of Health as to follow me to jest about it My Concern when I heard of your Danger was so very serious that I almost take it ill Dr  Evans  should tell you of it or you mention it I tell you fairly if you and a few more such people were to leave the World I would not give Sixpence to stay in it  I am not so much concern'd as to the point whether you are to live fat or lean Most Men of Wit or Honesty are usually decreed to live very lean so I am inclined to the opinion that 'tis decreed you shall However be comforted and reflect that you'll make the better Busto for it  'Tis something particular in you not to be satisfied with sending me your own Books but to make your Acquaintance continue the Frolick Mr  Wharton  forc'd me to take  Gorboduc  which has since done me great Credit with several People as it has done  Dryden  and  Oldham  some Diskindness in shewing there is as much difference between their  Gorboduc  and this as between Queen  Anne  and King  George  It is truly a Scandal that Men should write with Contempt of a Piece which they never once saw as those two Poets did who were ignorant even of the Sex as well as Sense of  Gorboduc  Adieu I am going to forget you This minute you took up all my mind the next I shall think of nothing but the Terms of  Agamemnon  and the Recovery of  Briseis  I shall be  Achilles  's humble Servant these two Months with the good Leave of all my Friends I have no Ambition so strong at present as that noble One of Sir  Salathiel Lovel  Recorder of  London  to furnish out a decent and plentiful Execution of  Greeks  and  Trojans  It is not to be exprest how heartily I wish the Death of all  Homer  's Heroes one after another The Lord preserve me in the Day of Battle which is just approaching Dear Sir join in your prayers for me and know me to be always whether I live die or am damn'd as a Poet  Yours most faithfully  To the same  London  March  Dear Sir  TO convince you how little pain I give myself in corresponding with Men of good Nature and good Understanding you see I omit to answer your Letters till a time when another Man would be ashamed to own he had received  them If therefore you are ever moved on my Account by that Spirit which I take to be as familiar to you as a Quotidian Ague I mean the Spirit of Goodness pray never stint it in any fear of obliging me to a Civility beyond my natural Inclination I dare trust you Sir not only with my Folly when I write but with my Negligence when I do not and expect equally your Pardon for either  If I knew how to entertain you thro' the rest of this Paper it should be spotted and diversified with Conceits all over you should be put out of Breath with Laughter at each Sentence and pause at each Period to look back over how much Wit you had pass'd But I have found by Experience that People now adays regard Writing as little as they do Preaching The most we can hope is to be heard just with Decency and Patience once a Week by Folks in the Country Here in Town we hum over a Piece of fine Writing and we whistle at a Sermon The Stage is the only Place we seem alive at there indeed we stare and roar and clap Hands for K  George  and the Government As for all other Virtues but this Loyalty they are an obsolete Train so illdress'd that Men Women and Children hiss 'em out of all good Company Humility knocks so sneakingly at the Door  that every Footman outraps it and makes it give way to the free Entrance of Pride Prodigality and Vainglory  My Lady  Scudamore  from having rusticated in your Company too long really behaves herself scandalously among us She pretends to open her Eyes for the Sake of seeing the Sun and to sleep because it is Night drinks Tea at nine in the Morning and is thought to have said her Prayers before talks without any manner of Shame of good Books and has not seen  Cibber  's Play of the  Nonjuror  I rejoiced the other Day to see a Libel on her Toilette which gives me some Hope that you have at least a Taste of Scandal left you in Defect of all other Vices  Upon the whole Matter I heartily wish you well but as I cannot entirely desire the Ruin of all the Joys of this City so all that remains is to wish you wou'd keep your Happiness to your selves that the happiest here may not die with Envy at a Bliss which they cannot attain to  I am  c  To the same  May  Dear Sir  YOU'LL think me very full of my self when after a long Silence which  however to say Truth has rather been employ'd to contemplate of you than to forget you I begin to talk of my own Works I find it is in the finishing a Book as in concluding a Session of Parliament one always thinks it will be very soon and finds it very late There are many unlook'd for Incidents to retard the clearing  any publick Account  and so I see it is in mine I have plagued myself like great Ministers with undertaking too much for one Man and with a Desire of doing more than was expected from me have done less than I ought  For having design'd four very laborious and uncommon sorts of Indexes to  Homer  I'm forc'd for want of Time to publish two only the Design of which you will own to be pretty tho' far from being fully executed I've also been oblig'd to leave unfinish'd in my Desk the Heads of two Essays one on the  Theology  and  Morality  of  Homer  and another on the  Oratory  of  Homer  and  Virgil  So they must wait for future Editions or perish and one Way or other no great Matter which  dabit Deus his quoque finem  I think of you every Day I assure you even without such good Memorials of you as your Sisters with whom I sometimes talk of you and find it one of the most agreeable of all Subjects to them My Lord  Digby  must be perpetually remember'd by all who ever knew him or knew his Children There needs no more than an Acquaintance with your Family to make all Elder Sons wish they had Fathers to their Livesend  I can't touch upon the Subject of filial Love without putting you in mind of an old Woman who has a sincere hearty oldfashion'd Respect for you and constantly blames her Son for not having writ to you oftner to tell you so  I very much wish but what signifies my wishing my Lady  Scudamore  wishes your Sister's wish that you were with us to compare the beautiful Contrast this Season affords us of the Town and the Country No Ideas you could form in the Winter can make you imagine what  Twickenham  is and what your Friend Mr  Johnson  of  Twickenham  is in this warmer Season Our River glitters beneath an unclouded Sun at the same time that its Banks retain the Verdure of Showers Our Gardens are offering their first Nosegays our Trees like new Acquaintance brought happily together are stretching their Arms to meet each other and growing nearer and nearer every Hour The Birds are paying their thanksgiving Songs for the new Habitations I have made 'em My Building rites  high enough to attract the Eye and Curiosity of the Passenger from the River where upon beholding a Mixture of Beauty and Ruin he enquires what House is falling or what Church is rising So little taste have our common Tritons of  Vitruvius  whatever Delight the true unseen poetical Gods of the River may take in reflecting on their Streams my  Tuscan  Porticos or  Ionic  Pilasters  But to descend from all this Pomp of Style the best Account I can give of what I am building is that it will afford me a few pleasant Rooms for such a Friend as yourself or a cool Situation for an Hour or two for Lady  Scudamore  when she will do me the Honour at this Publick House on the Road to drink her own Cyder  The Moment I am writing this I am surprized with the account of the Death of a Friend of mine which makes all I have here been talking of a meer Jest Buildings Gardens Writings Pleasures Works of whatever stuff Man can raise none of them God knows capable of advantaging a Creature that is mortal or of satisfying a Soul that is immortal Dear Sir I am  Your most faithful Servant  To the same  July  YOUR kind Desire to know the State of my Health had not been unsatisfied of so long had not that ill State been the Impediment Nor should I have seem'd an unconcern'd Party in the Joys of your Family which I heard of from Lady  Scudamore  whose short  Eschantillon  of a Letter of a quarter of a Page I value as the short Glimpse of a Vision afforded to some devout Hermit for it includes as those Revelations do a Promise of a better Life in the Elysian Groves of  Cirencester  whither I could almost say in the Style of a Sermon the  Lord bring us all  c Thither may we tend by various ways to one blissful Bower Thither may Health Peace and good Humour wait upon us as Associates Thither may whole Cargoes of Nectar Liquor of Life and Longaevity by Mortals call'd  Sp  gwater  be convey'd and there as  Milton  has it may we like the Deities  On Flow'rs repos'd and with fresh Gerlands crown'd  Quaff Immortality and Joy  When I speak of Garlands I should not forget the green Vestments and Scarfs which your Sisters promis'd to make for this Purpose I expect you too in Green with a Huntinghorn by your Side and a green Hat the Model of which you may take from  Osborne  's Description of King  James  the First  What Words what Numbers what Oratory or what Poetry can suffice to express how infinitely I esteem value love and desire you all above all the great ones the rich ones and the vain ones of this Part of the World above all the Jews Jobbers Bubblers Subscribers Projectors Directors Governors Treasurers  c c c c in saecula soeculorum  Turn your Eyes and Attention from this miserable mercenary Period and turn yourself in a just Contempt of these Sons of Mammon to the Contemplation of Books Gardens and Marriage In which I now leave you and return Wretch that I am to Watergruel and  Palladio  I am  c  To the same  Twickenham  Sept  Dear Sir  YOUR Doctor is going to the  Bath  and stays a Fortnight or more Perhaps you would be comforted to have a Sight of him whether you need him or not I think him as good a Doctor as any for one that is ill and a better Doctor than any for one that is well He would do admirably for Mrs  Mary Digby  She needed only to follow his Hints to be in eternal Business and Amusement of Mind and even as active as she could desire But indeed I fear she would outwalk him For as Dean  Swift  observ'd to me the very first time I saw the Doctor  He is a Man that can do every thing but walk  His Brother who is lately come into  England  goes also to the  Bath  and is a more extraordinary Man than he worth your going thither on purpose to know him The Spirit of  Philanthropy  so long dead to our World is reviv'd in him He is a Philosopher all of Fire so warmly nay so wildly in the Right that he sorces all others about him to be so too and draws them into his  own  Vortex  He is a Star that looks as if it were all Fire but is all Banignity all gentle and beneficial Influence If there be other Men in the World that would serve a Friend yet he is the only one I believe that could make even an Enemy serve a Friend  As all human Life is chequer'd and mix'd with Acquisitions and Losses though the latter are more certain and irremediable than the former lasting or satisfactory so at the time I have gain'd the Acquaintance of one worthy Man I have lost another a very easy human and gentlemanly Neighbour Mr  Stonor  It's certain the Loss of one of this Character puts us naturally upon setting a greater Value on the sew that are left though the Degree of our Esteem may be different Nothing says  Seneca  is so melancholy a Circumstance in human Life or so soon reconciles us to to the Thought of our own Death as the Reflection and Prospect of one Friend after another dropping round us Who would stand alone the sole remaining Ruin the last tottering Column of all the Fabrick of Friendship once so large seemingly so strong and yet so suddenly sunk and buried  I am  c  To the same  Saturday Night  Dear Sir  I Have belief enough in the goodness of your whole family to think you will all be pleas'd that I am arriv'd in saftey at  Twickenham  tho' 'tis a sort of Earnest that you will be troubled again with me at  Sherborne  or  Coleshill  for however I may like One of your places it may be in that as in liking One of your family when one secs the rest one likes them all Pray make my services acceptable to them I wish them all the happiness they may want and the continuance of all the happiness they have and I take the latter to comprize a great deal more than the former I must separate Lady  Scudamore  from you as I fear she will do herself before this letter reaches you So I wish her a good journey and I hope one day to try if she lives as well as you do tho' I much question if she can live as quietly I suspect the Bells will be ringing at her arrival and on her own and Miss  Scudamore  's birthdays and that all the Clergy in the County come to pay respects both the Clergy and their Bells expecting from her and  from the young Lady further business and further employment Besides all this there dwells on the one side of her the Lord  Coningsby  and on the other Mr  W  Yet I shall when the Days and the Years come about adventure upon all this for her sake  I beg my Lord  Digby  to think me a better Man than to content myself with thanking him in the common way I am in as sincere a sense of the word His Servant as you are his Son or he your Father  I must in my turn insist upon hearing how my last fellowtravellers got home from  Clarendon  and desire Mr  Philips  to remember me in his Cyder and to tell Mr  W  that I am dead and buried  I wish the young Ladies whom I almost robb'd of their good Name a better Name in return even that very name to each of them which they like best for the sake of the Man that bears it  Your ever faithful and affectionate Servant  To the same    YOUR making a sort of Apology for your not writing is a very genteel reproof to me I know I was to blame but I know I did not intend to be so and what is the happiest Knowledge in the World I know you will forgive me For sure nothing is more satisfactory than to be certain of such a Friend as will overlook one's Failings since every such instance is a Conviction of his Kindness  If I am all my life to dwell in Intentions and never to rise to Actions I have but too much need of that gentle disposition which I experience in you But I hope better things of myself and fully purpose to make you a visit this summer at  Sherbourn  I'm told you are all upon removal very speedily and that Mrs  Mary Digly  talks in a Letter to Lady  Scudamore  of seeing my Lord  Bathurst  's Wood in her way How much I wish to be her Guide thro' that enchanted Forest is not to be exprest I look upon myself as the Magician appropriated to the place without whom no mortal can penetrate into the Recesses of those sacred Shades I could pass whole Days in only describing to  her the future and as yet visionary Beauties that are to rise in those Scenes The Palace that is to be built the Pavillions that are to glitter the Colonnades that are to adorn them Nay more the meeting of the  Thames  and the  Severn  which when the noble Owner has finer Dreams than ordinary are to be led into each other's Embraces thro' secret Caverns of not above twelve or fifteen Miles till they rise and openly celebrate their Marriage in the midst of an immense Amphitheatre which is to be the Admiration of Posterity a hundred Years hence But till the destin'd time shall arrive that is to manifest these Wonders Mrs  Digly  must content herself with seeing what is at present no more than the finest Wood in  England  The Objects that attract this part of the world are of a quite different Nature Women of Quality are all turn'd Followers of the  Camp  in  HydePark  this Year whither all the Town resort to magnificent Entertainments given by the Officers  c  The  Seythian  Ladies that dwelt in the Waggons of War were not more closely attached to the Luggage The Matrons like those of  Sparta  attend their Sons to the Field to be the Witnesses of their glorious Deeds and the Maidens  with all their Charms display'd provoke the Spirit of the Soldiers Tea and Coffee supply the place of  Lacedemonian  black Broth This camp seems crowded with perpetual Victory for every Sun that rises in the Thunder of Cannon sets in the Musick of Violins Nothing is yet wanting but the constant presence of the  Princess  to represent the  Mater Exercitus  At  Twickenham  the World goes otherwise There are certain old People who take up all my time and will hardly allow me to keep any other Company They were introduced here by a Man of their own sort who has made me perfectly rude to all my Contemporaries and won't so much as suffer me to look upon 'em The Person I complain of is the Bishop of  Rochester  Yet he allows me form something he has heard of your Character and that of your Family as if you were of the old Sect of Moralists to write three or four sides of Paper to you and to tell you what these sort of People never tell but with Truth and religious Sincerity that I am and ever will be  Dear SIR  Yours  c  To the same  THE same reason that hinder'd your writing hinder'd mine the pleasing Expectation to see you in Town Indeed since the willing Confinement I have lain under here with my Mother whom it is natural and reasonable I should rejoice with as well as grieve I could the better bear your Absense from  London  for I could hardly have seen you there and it would not have been quite reasonable to have drawn you to a sick Room hither from the first Embraces of your Friends My Mother is now I thank God wondersully recovered tho' not so much as yet to venture out of her Chamber yet enough to enjoy a few particular Friends when they have the good Nature to look upon her I may recommend to you the Room we sit in upon one and that a favourite Account that it is the very  warmest  in the House We and our Fires will equally smile upon your Face There is a  Persian  Proverb that says I think very prettily  The Conversation of a Friend brightens the  Eyes  This I take to be a Splendor still more agreeable than the Fires you so delightfully describe  That you may long enjoy your own Fireside in the metaphorical Sense that is all those of your Family who make it pleasing to sit and spend whole wintry Months together a far more rational Delight and better selt by an honest Heart than all the glaring Entertainments numerous Lights and false Splendors of an  Assembly  of empty Heads aking Hearts and false Faces This is my sincere Wish to you and yours  You say you propose much Pleasure in seeing some few  Faces  about Town of my Acquaintance I guess you mean Mrs  Howara  's and Mrs  Blount  's And I assure you you ought to take as much Pleasure in their  Hearts  if they are what they sometimes express with regard to you  Believe me dear Sir to you all a very faithful Servant  To the same  Octob  Dear Sir  I Was upon the point of taking a much greater Journey than to  Bermudas  even to That undiscover'd Country from whose Bourn no Traveller returns  A Fever carry'd me on the high Gallop towards it for six or seven daysBut here you have me now and that's all I shall say of it Since which time an impertinent Lameness kept me at home twice as long as if Fate should say after the other dangerons Illness  "You shall neither go into the other World nor any where you like in this"  Else who knows but I had been at  Homlacy  I conspire in your Sentiments emulate your Pleasures wish for your Company You are all of one Heart and one Soul as was said of the Primitive Christians 'Tis like the Kingdom of the Just upon Earth not a wicked Wretch to interrupt you but a Set of trv'd experienc'd Friends and fellow Comforters who have seen Evil Men and Evil Days and have by a superior Rectitude of Heart set yourselves above them  and reap your Reward Why will you ever of your own accord end such a Millenary Year in  London  transmigrate if I may so call it into other Creatures in that Scene of folly Militant when you may reign for ever at  Homlacy  in Sense and Reason Triumphant I appeal to a Third Lady in your Family whom I take to be the most Innocent and the least warp'd by idle Fashion and Custom of you all I appeal to Her if you are not every Soul of you better People better Companions and happier where you are I desire her Opinion under her Hand in your next Letter I mean Miss  Scudamore  's  Afterwards Duchess of  Beaufort  at this time about  Years old  I'm confident if she would or durst speak her Sense and employ that Reasoning which God has given her to infuse more thoughtfulness into you all those Arguments could not fail to put you to the blush and keep you out of Town like People sensible of your own Felicities I am not without hopes if She can detain a Parliament Man and a Lady of Quality from the World one Winter that I may come upon you with such irresistable Arguments another Year as may carry you all  with me to  Bermudas  About this time the Rev Dean  Berkly  conceived his Project of erecting a Settlement in  Bermuda  for the Propagation of the Christian Faith and of Sciences in  America  the Seat of all Earthly Happiness and the new  Jerusalem  of the Righteous  Don't talk of the decay of the Year the Season is good where the People are so 'Tis the best Time of the Year for a Painter there is more Variety of Colours in the Leaves the Prospects begin to open thro' the thinner Woods over the Vallies and thro' the high Canopies of Trees to the higher Arch of Heaven The Dews of the Morning impearl every Thorn and scatter Diamonds on the verdant Mantle of the Earth The Frosts are fresh and wholesome What wou'd ye have The Moon shines too tho' not for Lovers these cold Nights but for Astronomers  Have ye not  Reflecting Telescopes  These Instruments were just then brought to perfection  whereby ye may innocently magnify her Spots and Blemishes Content yourselves with them and do not come to a Place where your own Eyes become Reflecting Telescopes and where those of all others are equally such upon their Neighbours Stay You at least for what I've said before relates only to the Ladies don't imagine I'll write about any  Eyes  but theirs Stay I  say from that idle busylooking  Sanhedrin  where  Wisdom  or  No Wisdom  is the Eternal Debate not as it lately was in  Ireland  an Accidental one  If after all you will despise good Advice and resolve to come to  London  here you will find me doing just the things I should not living where I should not and as worldly as idle in a Word as much an  AntiBermudanist  as any body Dear Sir make the Ladies know I am their Servant You know I am  Yours  c  To the Same  Aug  I Have been above a month strolling about in  Buckinghamshire  and  Oxfordshire  from Garden to Garden but still returning to Lord  Cobham  's with fresh Satisfaction I should be sorry to see my Lady  Scudamore  's till it has had the full Advantage of Lord  Bathurst  's Improvements and then I will expect something like the waters of  Riskins  and the woods of  Oakley  together which without flattery would be at least as good as any thing in our World For as to the  hanging Gardens of  Babylon  the Paradise of  Cyrus  and the Sharawaggis of of  China  I have little or no Ideas of 'em but I dare say Lord  B  t  has because they were certainly both very  Great  and very  Wild  I hope Mrs  Mary Digby  is quite tired of his Lordship's  Extravagante Bergerie  and that she is just now sitting or rather inclining on a Bank fatigu'd with over much Dancing and Singing at his unwearied Request and Instigation I know your love of Ease so well that you might be in danger of being too Quiet to enjoy Quiet and too Philosophical to be a Philosopher were it not for the Ferment Lord  B  will put you into One of his Lordship's Maxims is that a total Abstinence from Intemperance or Business is no more  Philosophy  than a total Composition of the Senses is  Repose  one must  Feel  enough of its Contrary to have a Relish of either But after all let your Temper work and be as sedate and contemplative as you will I'll engage you shall be fit for his Lordship when you come to Town in the Winter Folly will laugh you into all the Customs of the Company here nothing will be able to prevent your Conversion to her but Indisposition which I hope will be far from you I am telling the worst that can come of you for as to Vice you are safe but Folly is many an honest Man's nay every  goodhumour'd Man's Lot Nay it is the Seasoning of Life and Fools in one Sense are the Salt of the Earth a little is excellent tho' indeed a whole Mouthful is justly call'd the  Devil  So much for your Diversions next Winter and for mine I envy you much more at present than I shall then for if there be on Earth an Image of Paradise it is in such perfect Union and Society as you all possess I wou'd have my innocent Envies and Wishes of your State known you all which is far better than making you Compliments for it is inward Approbation and Esteem My Lord  Digby  has in me a sincere Servant or would have were there any occasion for me to manifest it  To the same  Sept  Dear Sir  I AM glad your Travels delighted you improve you I am sure they could not you are not so much a Youth as that tho' you run about with a King of sixteen and  what makes him still more a Child a King of  Frenchmen  My own time has been more melancholy spent in an Attendance upon Death which has seized one of our Family my poor old Nurse My Mother is something better though at her advanc'd Age every Day is a Climacteric There was join'd to this an Indisposition of my own which I ought to look upon as a slight one compar'd with my Mother's because my Life is not of half the Consequence to any Body that her's is to me All these Incidents have hinder'd my more speedy Reply to your obliging Letter  The Article you enquire of is of as little Concern to me as you desire it shou'd namely the Railing Papers about the  Odyssey  If the Book has Merit and since you like it it must it will extinguish all such nasty Scandal as the Sun puts an end to stinks meerly by  coming out  I wish I had nothing to trouble me more an honest Mind is not in the power of any dishonest one To break it's Peace there must be some Guilt or Consciousness which is inconsistent with it's own Principles Not but Malice and Injustice have their Day like some poor shortliv'd Vermine that die of shooting their own Stings  Falshood is Folly  says  Homer  and Liars and Calumniators at last hurt none but themselves even  in this World In the next 'tis Charity to say God have Mercy on them They were the Devil's Vicegerents upon Earth who is the Father of Lies and I fear has a Right to dispose of his Children  I've had an Occasion to make these Reflexions of late more justly than from any thing that concerns my Writings for it is one that concerns my Morals and which I ought to be as tender of as my own the good Character of another very innocent Person who I'm sure shares your Friendship no less than I do ***** No Creature has better natural Dispositions or would act more rightly or reasonably in every Duty did she act by herself or from herself But you know it is the Misfortune of that Family to be governed like a Ship I mean the Head guided by the Tail and that by every Wind that blows in it  To the same  Decemb  Dear Sir  IT is now the Season to wish you a good End of one Year and a happy Beginning of another but both these you know how to make yourself by only continuing such  a Life as you have been long accustomed to lead As for Good Works they are things I dare not name either to those that do them or to those that do them not the first are too modest and the latter too selfish to bear the mention of what are become either too old fashion'd or too private to constitute any Part of the Vanity or Reputation of the present Age However it were to be wish'd People would now and then look upon Good Works as they do upon old Wardrobes meerly in case any of 'em should by chance come into Fashion again as ancient Fardingales revive in modern Hoop'd Petticoats which may be properly compar'd to Charities as they cover a Multitude of Sins  They tell me that at  certain antiquated Charities and obsolete Devotions are yet subsisting That a thing called Christian Chearfulness not incompatible with  Christmas  Pyes and Plumbbroth whereof frequent is the mention in old Sermons and Almanacks is really kept alive and in Practice That feeding the Hungry and giving Alms to the Poor do yet make a Part of good Housekeeping in a Latitude not more remote from  London  than fourscore Miles And lastly that Prayers and Roastbeef actually make some People as happy as a Whore and a Bottle But here in Town  I assure you Men Women and Children I have done with these things Charity not only begins but ends at home Instead of the four Cardinal Virtues now reign four Princely ones We have Cunning for Prudence Rapine for Justice Timeserving for Fortitude and Luxury for Temperance Whatever you may fancy where you live in a State of Ignorance and see nothing but Quiet Religion and Good Humour the Case is just as I tell you where People understand the World and know how to live with Credit and Glory  I wish that Heaven would open the Eyes of Men and make 'em sensible  which  of these is right Whether upon a due Conviction we are to quit Faction and Gaming and Highfeeding and Whoring and take to your Country Way or you to leave Prayers and Almsgiving and Reading and Exercise and come into our Measures I wish I say that this Matter were as clear to all Men as it is to  Your Affectionate  c  LETTERS TO EDWARD BLOUNT  Esq  From to  To EDWARD BLOUNT  Esq  Jan  Dear Sir  I Know of nothing that will be so Interessing to you at present as some circumstances of the last Act of that eminent Comic Poet and our Friend  Wycherley  He had often told me as I doubt not he did all his Acquaintance that he would marry as soon as his life was despair'd of Accordingly a few days before his Death he underwent the Ceremony and join'd together those two Sacraments which wise Men say should be the last we receive for if you observe Matrimony is plac'd after Extreme  Unction in our Catechism as a kind of Hint of the Order of Time in which they are to be taken The old Man then lay down satisfy'd in the Conscience of having by this one Act paid his just Debts obliged a Woman who he was told had Merit and shewn a heroic resentment of the ill usage of his next Heir Some hundred pounds which he had with the Lady discharged those Debts a Jointure of four hundred a year made her a Recompence and the Nephew he left to comfort himself as well as he could with the miserable Remains of a mortgaged Estate I saw our Friend twice after this was done less peevish in his Sickness than he used to be in his Health neither much afraid of dying nor which in him had been more likely much ashamed of marrying The Evening before he expired he called his young Wife to the bedside and earnestly entreated her not to deny him one request the last he should make Upon her Assurances of consenting to it he told her  My Dear it is only this that you will never marry an old Man again  I cannot help remarking that Sickness which often destroys both Wit and Wisdom yet seldom has power to remove that Talent which we call  Humour  Mr  Wycherley  shew'd his even in this last Compliment tho' I think his request a little hard for  why should he bar her from doubling her Jointure on the same easy Terms  So trivial as these Circumstances are I should not be displeas'd myself to know such Trifles when they concern or characterise any eminent Person The wisest and wittiest of Men are seldom wiser or wittier than others in these sober Moments At least our Friend ended much in the Character he had lived in And  Horace  's Rule for a Play may as well be apply'd to him as a Playwright  servetur ad imum  Qualis ab inceptu processerit sibi constet  I am  c  To the same  Feb  Dear Sir  I AM just return'd from the Country whither Mr  Rowe  accompanied me and pass'd a Week in the Forest I need not tell you how much a Man of his Turn entertain'd me but I must acquaint you there is a Vivacity and Gaiety of Disposition almost peculiar to him which make it impossible to part from him without that uneasiness which  generally succeeds all our pleasures I have been just taking a solitary walk by moonshine full of reflections on the transitory nature of all human delights and giving my Thoughts a loose in the contemplation of those Satisfactions which probably we may hereafter taste in the Company of separate Spirits when we shall range the walks above and perhaps gaze on this World at as vast a distance as we now do on those Worlds The pleasures we are to enjoy in that Conversation must undoubtedly be of a nobler kind and not unlikely may proceed from the Discoveries each shall communicate to another of God and of Nature for the Happiness of Minds can surely be nothing but Knowledge  The highest Gratification we receive from Company is  Mirth  which at the best is but a fluttering unquiet Motion that beats about the breast for a few moments and after leaves it void and empty  Keeping good Company even the best is but a less shameful Art of losing Time  What we here call  Science  and  Study  are little better The greater number of Arts to which we apply ourselves are mere groping in the Dark and even the search of our most important Concerns in a future being is but a needless anxious and uncertain haste to be knowing sooner than we can  what without all this sollicitude we shall know a little later We are but  Curious Impertinents  in the case of Futurity 'Tis not our business to be guessing what the State of Souls shall be but to be doing what may make our own State happy We cannot be Knowing but we can be Virtuous  If this be my Notion of a great part of that high Science Divinity you will be so civil as to imagine I lay no mighty Stress upon the rest Even of my darling Poetry I really make no other use than Horses of the Bells that gingle about their ears tho' now and then they toss their Heads as if they were proud of 'em only to jogg on a little more merrily  Your Observations on the narrow conceptions of Mankind in the point of Friendship confirm me in what I was so fortunate as at my first knowledge of you to hope and since so amply to experience Let me take so much decent Pride and Dignity upon me as to tell you that but for Opinions like these which I discover'd in your Mind I had never made the Trial I have done which has succeeded so much to mine and I believe not less to your Satisfaction For if I know you right your Pleasure is greater in obliging me than I can feel on my part till it falls in my power to oblige you  Your Remark that the Variety of opinion in Politics or Religion is often rather a Gratification than Objection to people who have Sense enough to consider the beautiful order of Nature in her Variations makes me think you have not construed  Joannes Secundus  wrong in the Verse which precedes that which you quote  Bene nota Fides  as I take it does no way signify the  Roman  Catholic Religion tho'  Secundus  was of it I think it was generous thought and one that flow'd from an exalted mind that it was not improbable but God might be delighted with the various methods of worshipping him which divided the whole World I am pretty sure You and I should no more make good  Inquisitors  to the modern Tyrants in Faith than we could have been qualify'd for  Lictors  to  Procrustes  when he converted refractory Members with the Rack In a word I can only repeat to you what I think I have formerly said that I as little fear God will damn a Man who has Charity as I hope that any Priest can save him without it  I am  c  To the same  March  Dear Sir  I Find that a real Concern is not only a Hindrance to Speaking but to Writing too The more time we give our selves to think over one's own or a Friend's unhappiness the more unable we grow to express the grief that proceeds from it It is as natural to delay a Letter at such a Season as this as to retard a melancholy Visit to a Person one cannot relieve One is ashamed in that Circumstance to pretend to entertain people with trifling insignificant affectations of Sorrow on the one hand or unseasonable and forced Gayeties on the other 'Tis a kind of profanation of things sacred to treat so solemn a matter as a generous voluntary Suffering with Compliments or Heroic Gallantries Such a Mind as your's has no need of being spirited up into Honour or like a weak Woman praised into an opinion of its own Virtue 'Tis enough to do and suffer what we ought and Men should know that the noble power of Suffering bravely is as far above that of Enterprizing greatly as an unblemish'd Conscience and inflexible Resolution are  above an accidental Flow of Spirits or a sudden Tide of Blood If the whole Religious Business of Mankind be included in Resignation to our Maker and Charity to our FellowCreatures there are now some People who give us the Opportunity of affording as bright an Example in practising the one as themselves have given an infamous Instance of the Violation of the other Whoever is really brave has always this Comfort when he is opprest that he knows himself to be superior to those who injure him For the greatest Power on Earth can no sooner do him that Injury but the brave Man can make himself greater by forgiving it  If it were generous to seek for alleviating Consolations in a Calamity of so much Glory one might say that to be ruin'd thus in the Gross with a whole People is but like perishing in the General Conflagration where nothing we can value is left behind us  Methinks in our present Condition the most heroic thing we are left capable of doing is to endeavour to lighten each other's Load and opprest as we are to succour such as are yet more opprest If there are too many who cannot be assisted but by what we cannot give our Money there are yet others who may be relieved by our Counsel by our Countenance and even by our  Chearfulness The Misfortunes of private Families the Misunderstandings of People whom Distresses make suspicious the Coldnesses of Relations whom Change of Religion may dis unite or the Necessities of halfruin'd Estates render unkind to each other these at least may be soften'd in some degrees by a general wellmanag'd Humanity among ourselves if all those who have your Principles of Belief had also your Sense and Conduct But indeed most of 'em have given lamentable  This was written in the Year of the Affair of  Preston  proofs of the contrary and 'tis to be apprehended that they who want Sense are only religious thro' Weakness and goodnatur'd thro' Shame These are narrowminded Creatures that never deal in Essentials their Faith never looks beyond Ceremonials nor their Charity beyond Relations As poor as I am I would gladly relieve any distressed conscientious  French  Refugee at this instant what must my Concern then be when I perceive so many Anxieties now tearing those Hearts which I have desired a place in and Clouds of Melancholy rising on those Faces which I have long look'd upon with Affection I begin already to feel both what some apprehend and what others are yet too stupid  to apprehend I grieve with the Old for so many additional Inconveniences and Chagrins more than their small Remain of Life seem'd destin'd to undergo and with the Young for so many of those Gayeties and Pleasures the Portion of Youth which they will by this means be depriv'd of This brings into my mind one or other of those I love best and among them the Widow and Fatherless late of  As I am certain no People living had an earlier and truer Sense of others Misfortunes or a more generous Resignation as to what might be their own so I earnestly wish that whatever part they must bear may be render'd as supportable to them as it is in the power of any Friend to make it  But I know you have prevented me in this Thought as you always will in any thing that's good or generous I find by a Letter of your Lady's which I have seen that their Ease and Tranquility is part of your Care I believe there's some Fatality in it that you should always from time to time be doing those particular things that make me enamour'd of you  I write this from  Windsor  Forest of which I am come to take my last look We here bid our Neighbours adieu much as those who go to be hang'd do their FellowPrisoners who are condemn'd to follow  them a few weeks after I parted from honest Mr  D  with tenderness and from old Sir  William Trumball  as from a venerable Prophet foretelling with lifted hands the Miseries to come from which he is just going to be remov'd himself  Perhaps now I have learnt so far as  Nos Dulcia linquimus arva  My next Lesson may be  Nos Patriam fugimus  Let that and all else be as Heaven pleases I have provided just enough to keep me a Man of Honour I believe you and I shall never be asham'd of each other I know I wish my Country well and if it undoes me it shall not make me wish it otherwise  To the same  June  Dear Sir  IF a Regard both to Publick and Private Affairs may plead a lawful Excuse in behalf of a negligent Correspondent I have really a very good Title to it I cannot say  whether 'tis a Felicity or Unhappiness that I am obliged at this time to give up my whole Application to  Homer  when without that Employment my Thoughts must turn upon what is less agreeable the Violence Madness and Resentment of modern Warmakers which are likely to prove to some People at least more fatal than the same Qualities in  Achilles  did to his unfortunate Countrymen  Tho' the change of my Scene of Life from  Windsor  Forest to the Side of the  Thames  be one of the grand  Aera's  of my days and may be called a notable Period in so inconsiderable a History yet you can scarce imagine any Hero passing from one Stage of Life to another with so much Tranquillity so easy a Transition and so laudable a Behaviour I am become so truly a Citizen of the World according to  Plato  's Expression that I look with equal Indifference on what I have lost and on what I have gained The Times and Amusements past are not more like a Dream to me than those which are present I lie in a refreshing kind of Inaction and have one Comfort at least from Obscurity that the  Darkness  helps me to  sleep  the better I now and then reflect upon the Enjoyment of my Friends whom I fancy I remember much as separate Spirits do us at tender  Intervals neither interrupting their own Employments nor altogether careless of ours but in general constantly wishing us well and hoping to have us one day in their Company  To grow indifferent to the World is to grow Philosophical or Religious whichsoever of those Turns we chance to take and indeed the World is such a thing as one that thinks pretty much must either laugh at or be angry with But if we laugh at it they say we are proud and if we are angry with it they say we are illnatur'd So the most politic Way is to seem always better pleas'd than one can be greater Admirers greater Lovers and in short greater Fools than we really are So shall we live comfortably with our Families quietly with our Neighbours favour'd by our Masters and happy with our Mistresses I have filled my Paper and so adieu  To the same  Sept  Dear Sir  I Think your leaving  England  was like a good Man's leaving the World with the blessed Conscience of having acted  well in it And I hope you have received your Reward in being happy where you are I believe in the Religious Country you now inhabit you'll be better pleas'd to find I consider you in this light than if I compared you to those  Greeks  and  Romans  whose Constancy in suffering Pain and whose Resolution in pursuit of a generous End you would rather imitate than boast of  But I had a melancholy hint the other day as if you were yet a Martyr to the fatigue your Virtue made you undergo on this side the Water I beg if your health be restor'd to you not to deny me the Joy of knowing it Your endeavours of Service and good Advices to the poor Papists put me in mind of  Noah's  preaching forty years to those folks that were to be drowned at last At the worst I heartily wish your Ark may find an  Ararat  and the Wife and Family the hopes of the good Patriarch land safely after the Deluge upon the Shore of  Totness  If I durst mix prophane with sacred History I would chear you with the old Tale of  Brutus  the wandering  Trojan  who found on that very Coast the happy End of his Peregrinations and Adventures  I have very lately read  Jeffery  of  Monmouth  to whom your  Cornwall  is not a little beholden in the Translation of a Clergyman  in my neighbourhood The poor Man is highly concerned to vindicate  Jeffery  's veracity as an Historian and tole me he was perfectly astonished we of the  Roman  Communion could doubt of the Legends of his Giants while we believ'd those of our Saints I am forced to make a fair Composition with him and by crediting some of the Wonders of  Corinaeus  and  Gogmagog  have brought him so far already that he speaks respectfully of St  Christopher  's carrying Christ and the Resuscitation of St  Nicholas Tolentine  's Chickens Thus we proceed apace in converting each other from all manner of Infidelity  Ajax  and  Hector  are no more compared to  Corinaeus  and  Arthur  than the  Guelphs  and  Ghibellines  were to the  Mohocks  of everdreadful memory This amazing Writer has made me lay aside  Homer  for a Week and when I take him up again I shall be very well prepared to translate with belief and reverence the Speech of  Achilles  's Horse  You'll excuse all this trifling or any thing else which prevents a Sheet full of Compliment And believe there is nothing more true even more true than any thing in  Jeffery  is false than that I have a constant Affection for you and am  c  P S  I know you will take part in rejoycing for the Victory of Prince  Eugene  over the  Turks  in the Zeal you bear to the Christian Interest tho' your Cousin of  Oxford  with whom I dined yesterday says there is no other difference in the Christians beating the  Turks  or the  Turks  beating the Christians than whether the Emperor shall first declare War against  Spain  or  Spain  declare it against the Emperor I must add another Apothegm of the same noble Earl it was the Saying of a Politick Prince  "Time and he would get the better of any two others"  To which Lord  Oxford  made this Answer  Time and I  'gainst any two  Chance and I  'gainst  Time  and  you  To the same  Nov  Dear Sir  THE Question you proposed to me is what at present I am the most unfit Man in the world to answer by my Loss of one of the best of Fathers  He had liv'd in such a Course of Temperance as was enough to make the longest Life agreeable to him and in such a Course of Piety as suffic'd to make the most sudden Death so also Sudden indeed it was However I heartily beg of God to give me such an one provided I can lead such a Life I leave him to the Mercy of God and to the Piety of a Religion that extends beyond the Grave  Si qua est ea cura  c  He has left me to the ticklish Management of a narrow Fortune where every false Step is dangerous My Mother is in that dispirited State of Resignation which is the effect of long Life and the Loss of what is dear to us We are really each of us in want of a Friend of such an humane Turn as yourself to make almost any thing desirable to us I feel your Absence more than ever at the same time I can less express my Regards to you than ever and shall make this which is the most sincere Letter I ever writ to you the shortest and faintest perhaps of any you have receiv'd 'Tis enough if you reflect that barely to remember any Person when one's Mind is taken up with a sensible Sorrow is a great degree of Friendship I can say no more but that I love you and all that are yours and that I wish it may be very long before any of yours shall feel for you what I now feel for my Father Adieu  To the same  Rentcomb in Gloucestershire  Oct  Dear Sir  YOUR kind Letter has overtaken me here for I have been in and about this Country ever since your departure I am pleas'd to date this from a place so well known to Mrs  Blount  where I write as if I were dictated by her Ancestors whose faces are all upon me I fear none so much as Sir  Christopher Guise  who being in his Shirt seems as ready to combate me as her own Sir  John  was to demolish Duke  Lancastere  I dare say your Lady will recollect his Figure I look'd upon the Mansion Walls and Terraces the Plantations and Slopes which Nature has made to command a variety of Valleys and rising Woods with a Veneration mixt with a Pleasure that represented her to me in those puerile Amusements which engaged her so many Years ago in this place I fancy'd I saw her sober over a Sampler or gay over a jointed Baby I dare say she did one thing more even in those early  times  remember'd her Creator in the Days of her Youth  You describe so well your Heremitical state of Life that none of the antient Anchorites could go beyond you for a Cave in a Rock with a fine Spring or any of the Accommodations that befit a Solitary Only I don't remember to have read that any of those venerable and holy Personages took with them a Lady and begat Sons and Daughters You must modestly be content to be accounted a Patriarch But were you a little younger I should rather rank you with Sir  Amadis  and his fellows If Piety be so Romantick I shall turn Hermit in good earnest for I see one may go so far as to be Poetical and hope to save one's Soul at the same time I really wish myself something more that is a Prophet for I wish I were as  Habakkuk  to be taken by the Hair of the Head and visit  Daniel  in his Den You are very obliging in saying I have now a whole Family upon my hands to whom to discharge the part of a Friend I assure you I like 'em all so well that I will never quit my Hereditary Right to them you have made me yours and consequently them mine I still see them walking on my Green at  Twickenham  and gratefully remember not only their green  Gowns but the Instructions they gave me how to slide down and trip up the steepest Slopes of my Mount  Pray think of me sometimes as I shall often of you and know me for what I am that is  Yours  To the same  Twickenham  Oct  Dear Sir  YOUR very kind and obliging manner of enquiring after me among the first Concerns of Life at your Resuscitation should have been sooner answer'd and acknowledg'd I sincerely rejoice at your recovery from an Illness which gave me less pain than it did you only from my Ignorance of it I should have else been seriously and deeply affected in the thought of your danger by a Fever I think it a fine and a natural thought which I lately read in a private Letter of  Montaigne  giving an account of the last words of an intimate Friend of his  'Adieu my Friend the pain I feel will soon be over but I grieve for  that you are to feel which is to last you for life'  I join with your Family in giving God thanks for lending us a worthy Man somewhat longer The Comforts you receive from their Attendance put me in mind of what old  Fletcher  of  Saltoune  said one day to me  'Alas I have nothing to do but to die I am a poor Individual no Creature to wish or to fear for my life or death 'Tis the only reason I have to repent being a single Man now I grow old I am like a Tree without a Prop and without young Trees of my own shedding to grow round me for Company and Defence'  I hope the Gout will soon go after the Fever and all evil things remove far from you But pray tell me when will you move towards us If you had an Interval to get hither I care not what fixes you afterwards except the Gout Pray come and never stir from us again Do away your dirty Acres cast 'em to dirty People such as in the ScripturePhrase  possess the Land  Shake off your Earth like the noble Animal in  Milton  The tawny Lyon pawing to get free  His hinder Parts he springs as broke from Bonds  And rampant shakes his brinded Main the Ounce  The Lizard and the Tyger as the Mole  Rising the crumbled Earth above them throw  In Hillocks  But I believe  Milton  never thought these fine Verses of his should be apply'd to a Man selling a parcel of dirty Acres tho' in the main I think it may have some resemblance for God knows this little space of Ground nourishes buries and confines us as that of  Eden  did those Creatures till we can shake it loose at least in our Affections and Desires  Believe dear Sir I truly love and value you let Mrs  Blount  know that she is in the list of my  Memento Domine's Famulorum Famularumque's  c My poor Mother is far from well declining and I am watching over her as we watch an expiring Taper that even when it looks brightest wastes fastest I am as you will see from the whole Air of this Letter not in the gayest nor easiest Humour but always with Sincerity  Dear Sir  Yours  To the same  June  Dear Sir  YOU may truly do me the Justice to think no Man is more your sincere Wellwisher than myself or more the sincere  wellwisher of your whole Family with all which I cannot deny but I have a mixture of Envy to you all for loving one another so well and for enjoying the sweets of that life which can only be tasted by people of good will  They from all Shades the Darkness can exclude  And from a Desart banish Solitude  Torbay  is a Paradise and a Storm is but an Amusement to such people If you drink Tea upon a Promontory that overhangs the Sea it is preferable to an Assembly and the whistling of the Wind better Music to contented and loving Minds than the Opera to the Spleenful Ambitious Diseas'd Distasted and Distracted Souls which this World affords nay this World affords no other Happy they who are banish'd from us but happier they who can banish themselves or more properly banish the World from them  Alas I live at  Twickenham  I take that Period to be very sublime and to include more than a hundred Sentences that might be writ to express Distraction Hurry Multiplication of Nothings and all the fatiguing perpetual Business of having no Business to do You'll wonder I reckon translating the  Odyssey  as nothing But whenever I think  seriously and of late I have met with so many Occasions of thinking seriously that I begin never to think otherwise I cannot but think these things very idle as idle as if a Beast of Burden should go on jingling his Bells without bearing any thing valuable about him or ever serving his Master  Life's vain Amusements amidst which we dwell  Not weigh'd or understood by the grim God of Hell  Said a Heathen Poet as he is translated by a Christian Bishop who has first by his Exhortations and since by his Example taught me to  think  as becomes a Reasonable CreatureBut he is gone He carry'd away more Learning than is left in this Nation behind him but he left us more in the noble Example of bearing Calamity well 'Tis true we want Literature very much but pray God we don't want Patience more if these Precedents are to prevail  I remember I promis'd to write to you as soon as I should hear you were got home You must look on this as the first Day I've been myself and pass over the Mad Interval unimputed to me How punctual a Correspondent I shall henceforward be able or not able to be God knows but he knows I shall ever be a punctual and grateful Friend and all the good Wishes of such an one will ever attend you  To the same  June  Dear Sir  YOU shew your self a just Man and a Friend in those Guesses and Suppositions you make at the possible reasons of my Silence every one of which is a true one As to forgetfulness of you or your's I assure you the promiscuous Conversations of the Town serve only to put me in mind of better and more quiet to be had in a Corner of the World undisturb'd innocent serene and sensible with such as you Let no Access of any Distrust make you think of me differently in a cloudy day from what you do in the most sunshiny Weather Let the young Ladies be assured I make nothing new in my Gardens without wishing to see the print of their Fairy Steps in every part of 'em I have put the last Hand to my works of this kind in happily finishing the subterraneous Way and Grotto I there found a Spring of the clearest Water which falls in a perpetual Rill that ecchoes thro' the Cavern day and night From the River  Thames  you see thro' my Arch up a Walk of the Wilderness to a kind of open  Temple wholly compos'd of Shells in the Rustic Manner and from that distance under the Temple you look down thro' a sloping Arcade of Trees and see the Sails on the River passing suddenly and vanishing as thro' a Perspective Glass When you shut the Doors of this Grotto it becomes on the instant from a luminous Room a  Camera obscura  on the Walls of which all the Objects of the River Hills Woods and Boats are forming a moving Picture in their visible Radiations And when you have a mind to light it up it affords you a very different Scene it is finished with Shells interpersed with Pieces of Lookingglass in angular forms and in the Ceiling is a Star of the same Material at which when a Lamp of an orbicular Figure of thin Alabaster is hung in the Middle a thousand pointed Rays glitter and are reflected over the Place There are connected to this Grotto by a narrower Passage two Porches with Niches and Seats one toward the River of smooth Stones full of light and open the other toward the Arch of Trees rough with Shells Flints and Iron Ore The Bottom is paved with simple Pebble as the adjoining Walk up the Wilderness to the Temple is to be Cockleshells in the natural Taste agreeing not ill with the little dripping Murmur and the Aquatic Idea of the whole Place It wants nothing  to compleat it but a good Statue with an Inscription like that beautiful antique one which you know I am so fond of  Hujus Nympha loci sacri custodia fontis  Dormio dum blandae sentio murmur aquae  Parce meum quisquis tangis cava marmora somnum  Rumpere seu bibas sive lavere tace  Nymph of the Grot these sacred Springs I keep  And to the Murmur of these Waters sleep  Whoe'er thou art ah gently tread the Cave  Ah bathe in silence or in silence lave  You'll think I have been very Poetical in this Description but it is pretty near the Truth I wish you were here to bear Testimony how little it owes to Art either the Place itself or the Image I give of it  I am  c  To the same  Sept  Dear Sir  I Should be asham'd to own the receipt of a very kind Letter from you two whole Months from the date of this if I were not  more asham'd to tell a Lye or to make an Excuse which is worse than a Lye for being built upon some probable Circumstance it makes use of a degree of Truth to falsity with It is a Lye  Guarded  Your Letter has been in my Pocket in constant wearing till that and the Pocket and the Suit are worn out by which means I have read it forty times and I find by so doing that I have not enough consider'd and reflected upon many others you have obliged me with for true Friendship as they say of good Writing will bear reviewing a thousand times and still discover new beauties  I have had a Fever a short one but a violent I am now well So it shall take up no more of this Paper  I begin now to expect you in Town to make the Winter to come more tolerable to us both The Summer is a kind of Heaven when we wander in a Paradisaical Scene of Nature among Groves and Gardens but at this Season we are like our poor first Parents turn'd out of that agreeable tho' solitary life and forc'd to look about for more people to help to bear our labours to get into warmer Houses and hive together in Cities  I hope you are long since perfectly restor'd and risen from your Gout happy in the delights of a contented Family smiling at  Storms laughing at Greatness and merry over a Christmasfire exercising all the Functions of an old Patriarch in Charity and Hospitality I will not tell Mrs  B  what I think she is doing for I conclude it is her opinion that he only ought to know it for whom it is done and she will allow herself to be far enough advanc'd above a fine Lady not to desire to shine before Men  Your Daughters perhaps may have some other thoughts which even their Mother must excuse them for because she is a Mother I will not however suppose those thoughts get the better of their Devotions but rather excite 'em and assist the warmth of them while their Prayer may be that they may raise up and breed as irreproachable a young Family as their Parents have done In a Word I fancy you all well easy and happy just as I wish you and next to that I wish you all with me  Next to God is a good Man Next in dignity and next in value  Minuisti eum paullo minus ab Angelis  If therefore I wish well to the good and the deserving and desire They only shou'd be my Companions and Correspondents I must very soon and very much think of you I want your Company and your Example Pray make haste to Town so as not again to leave us Discharge the Load of Earth that lies on you  like one of the Mountains under which the Poets say the Giants that is the  Men of the Earth  are whelmed Leave Earth to the Sons of Earth your Conversation is in Heaven Which that it may be accomplish'd in us all is the Prayer of him who maketh this short Sermon Value to you Three Pence Adieu  LETTERS OF Mr POPE to Mr GAY From to  Nov  SIR  YOU writ me a very kind Letter some months ago and told me you were then upon the point of taking a journey into  Devonshire  That hindered my answering you and I have since several times inquir'd of you without any Satisfaction for so I call the knowledge of your welfare or of any thing that concerns you I past two months in  Sussex  and since my Return have been again very ill I writ to  Lintot  in hopes of hearing of you but had no answer to that point Our Friend  Mr  Cromwell  too has been silent all this year I believe he has been displeas'd at some or other of my Freedoms which I very innocently take and most with those I think most my friends But this I know nothing of perhaps he may have open'd to you And if I know you right you are of a Temper to cement Friendships and not to divide them I really much love Mr  Cromwell  and have a true affection for your self which if I had any Interest in the world or Power with those who have I shou'd not be long without manifesting to you I desire you will not either out of Modesty or a vicious Distrust of another's value for you those two Eternal Foes to Merit imagine that your Letters and Conversation are not always welcome to me There's no man more intirely fond of goodnature or ingenuity than my self and I have seen too much of those qualities in Mr  Gay  to be any thing less than his  most affectionate Friend and real Servant A POPE  Binfield  No  Dec  Dear Sir  IT has been my good fortune within this month past to hear more things that have pleas'd me than I think almost in all my time beside But nothing upon my word has been so Homefelt a satisfaction as the News you tell me of your self and you are not in the least mistaken when you congratulate me upon your own good Success for I have more People to be happy out of than any illnatur'd man can boast I may with honesty affirm to you that notwithstanding the many Inconveniencies and Disadvantages they commonly talk of in the  Res angusti domi  I have never found any other than the inability of giving people of Merit the only certain proof of our value for them in doing 'em some real service For after all if we could but Think a little Selflove might make us Philosophers and convince us  Quantuli indiget Natura  Ourselves are easily provided for 'tis nothing but the Circumstantials and the Apparatus or Equipage of human life that costs so much the furnishing Only what a luxurious Man wants for horses and footmen  a goodnatur'd Man wants for his friends or the indigent  I shall see you this Winter with much greater pleasure than I could the last and I hope as much of your Time as your Attendance on the Dutchess will allow you to spare to any friend will not be thought lost upon one who is as much so as any man I must also put you in mind tho' you are now Secretary to this Lady that you are likewise Secretary to Nine other Ladies and are to write sometimes for them too He who is forc'd to live wholly upon those Ladies favours is indeed in as precarious a condition as any He who does what  Chaucer  saysfor  Sustenance  but they are very agreeable Companions like other Ladies when a Man only passes a Night or so with them at his leisure and away I am  Your  c  Aug  Dear Sir  JUST as I receiv'd yours I was set down to write to you with some shame that I had so long deferr'd it But I can hardly repent my neglect when it  gives me the knowledge how little you insist upon Ceremony and how much a greater share in your memory I have than I deserve I have been near a week in  London  where I am like to remain till I become by Mr  J  s  's help  Elegans Formarum Spectator  I begin to discover Beauties that were till now imperceptible to me Every Corner of an Eye or Turn of a Nose or Ear the smallest degree of Light or Shade on a Cheek or in a dimple have charms to distract me I no longer look upon Lord  Plausible  as ridiculous for admiring a Lady's fine Tip of an Ear and pretty Elbow as the  Plaindealer  has it but am in some danger even from the Ugly and Disagreeable since they may have their retired beauties in one Trait or other about 'em You may guess in how uneasy a state I am when every day the performances of others appear more beautiful and excellent and my own more despicable I have thrown away three Dr  Swift  's each of which was once my vanity two Lady  Bridgewaters  a Dutchess of  Montague  besides half a dozen Earls and one Knight of the Garter I have crucify'd  Christ  over again in effigie and made a  Madona  as old as her Mother St  Anne  Nay what is yet more miraculous I have rival'd St  Luke  himself in Painting and as 'tis said  an Angel came and finish'd his Piece so you would swear a Devil put the last hand to mine 'tis so begrim'd and smutted However I comfort my self with a Christian Reflection that I have not broken the Commandment for my Pictures are not the likeness of any thing in heaven above or in earth below or in the waters under the earth Neither will any body adore or worship them except the  Indians  should have a sight of 'em who they tell us worship certain Pagods or Idols purely for their Ugliness  I am very much recreated and refreshed with the News of the Advancement of the  Fan  which I doubt not will delight the Eye and Sense of the Fair as long as that agreeable Machine shall play in the Hands of Posterity I am glad your  Fan  is mounted so soon but I would have you varnish and glaze it at your leisure and polish the Sticks as much as you can You may then cause it to be born in the Lands of both Sexes no less in  Britain  than it is in  China  where it is ordinary for a  Mandarine  to fan himself cool after a Debate and a Statesman to hide his face with it when he tells a grave Lye  I am  c  Binfield  May  Dear Gay  SINCE by your letter we find you can be content to breath in smoak to walk in crouds and divert your self with noise nay and to make fine Pictures of this way of life we shou'd give you up as one abandoned to a wrong choice of pleasures We have however so much compassion on you as to think of inviting you to us where your taste for books friendship and ease may be indulg'd But if you do not come pray leave to tempt us with your description of the Court for indeed humanity is frail and we cannot but remember some particular honours which we have enjoy'd in conversation bate us this one point and we stand you still untir'd with one another and fresh to the pleasures of the country If you wou'd have any news from us know that we are well at present This I am sure wou'd have been allow'd by you as news from either of us a fortnight ago In return to this send us every thing you imagine diverting and pray forget not my commissions Give my respects to the Dean  Dr  Arbuthnot  Mr  Ford  and the Provost Dear  Gay  adieu  Your affectionate Friend and humble Servant THO PARNELLE  Dear Mr Gay  ABOVE all other News send us the best that of your good Health if you enjoy it which Mr  Harcourt  made us very much fear If you have any design either to amend your health or your life I know no better Expedient than to come hither where you should not want room tho' I lay my self in a Trucklebed under the Doctor You might here converse with the old Greeks be initiated into all their Customs and learn their Prayers by heart as we have done The Doctor last  Sunday  intending to say an  Our Father  was got half way in  Chryses'  Prayer to  Apollo  The ill effects of Contention and Squabling so lively describ'd in the first Iliad make Dr  Parnelle  and my self continue in the most exemplary Union in every thing We deserve to be worship'd by all the poor divided factious interested Poets of this world  As we rise in our speculations daily we are grown so grave that we have not condescended to laugh at any of the idle things about us this week I have contracted a severity of aspect from deep meditation on high subjects equal to the formidable Front of blackbrow'd  Jupiter  and become an awful Nod as well when I assent to some grave and weighty Proposition of the Doctor or inforce a Criticism of my own In a word  Y  g  himself has not acquired more Tragic Majesty in his aspect by reading his own Verses than I by  Homer  's  In this state I cannot consent to your publication of that ludicrous trifling Burlesque you write about Dr  Parnelle  also joins in my opinion that it will by no means be well to print it  Pray give with the utmost fidelity and esteem my hearty service to the Dean Dr  Arbuthnot  Mr  Ford  and to Mr  Fortescue  Let them also know at  Button  's that I am mindful of them I am divine Bucoliast  Thy loving Countryman  Oct  Dear Sir  I HAVE been perpetually troubled with sickness of late which has made me so melancholy that the Immortality of the Soul has been my constant Speculation as the Mortality of my Body my constant Plague In good earnest  Seneca  is nothing to a fit of illness  Dr  Parnelle  will honour  Tonson  's Miscellany with some very beautiful Copies at my request He enters heartily into our design I only fear his stay in town may chance to be but short Dr  Swift  much approves what I proposed even to the very title which I design shall be  The Works of the Unlearned  published monthly in which whatever Book appears that deserves praise shall be depreciated Ironically and in the same manner that modern Critics take to undervalue Works of Value and to commend the high Productions of  Grubstreet  I shall go into the Country about a month hence and shall then desire to take along with me your Poem of the  Fan  to consider it at full leisure I am deeply ingaged in Poetry the particulars whereof shall be deferr'd till we meet  I am very desirous of seeing Mr  Fortescue  when he comes to Town before his journey if you can any way acquaint him of my desire I believe his good nature will contrive a way for our meeting I am ever with all sincerity dear Sir  Your  c  Sept  Dear Mr Gay  WElcome to your native Soil welcome to your Friends thrice welcome to me whether return'd in glory blest with Courtinterest the love and familiarity of the Great and fill'd with agreeable Hopes or melancholy with Dejection contemplative of the changes of Fortune and doubtful for the future Whether return'd a triumphant  Whig  or a desponding  Tory  equally All Hail equally beloved and welcome to me If happy I am to share in your elevation if unhappy you have still a warm corner in my heart and a retreat at  Binfield  in the worst of times at your service If you are a  Tory  or thought so by any man I know it can proceed from nothing but your Gratitude  to a few People who endeavour'd to serve you and whose Politicks were never your Concern If you are a  Whig  as I rather hope and as I think your Principles and mine as Brother Poets had ever a Byass to the Side of Liberty I know you will be an honest man and an inoffensive one Upon the whole I know you are incapable of being so much of either Party as to be good for nothing Therefore once more whatever you are or in whatever state you are All Hail  One or two of your old Friends complain'd they had heard nothing from you since the  Queen  's Death I told 'em no man living lov'd Mr  Gay  better than I yet I had not once written to him in all his Voyage This I thought a convincing proof how truly one may be a friend to another without telling him so every month But they had reasons too themselves to alledge in your excuse as men who really value one another will never want such as make their friends and themselves easy The late universal Concern in publick affairs threw us all into a hurry of Spirits even I who am more a Philosopher than to expect any thing from any Reign was born away with the current and full of the expectation of the Successor During your Journeys I knew not whither to aim  a letter after you that was a sort of shooting flying add to this the demand  Homer  had upon me to write fifty Verses a day besides learned Notes all which are at a conclusion for this year Rejoice with me O my Friend that my Labour is over come and make merry with me in much Feasting for I to thee and thou to me We will feed among the Lilies By the Lilies I mean the Ladies with whom I hope you have fed to Satiety Hast thou passed through many Countries and not tasted the delights thereof Hast thou not left to thy Issue in divers Lands that  German Gays  and  Dutch Gays  may arise to write Pastorals and sing their Songs in strange Countries Are not the  Blouzelinda's  of the  Hague  as charming as the  Rosalinda's  of  Britain  or have the two great Pastoral Poets of our Nation renounced Love at the same time for  Philips  immortal  Philips Hanover Philips  hath deserted yea and in a rustick manner kicked his  Rosalind  Dr  Parnelle  and I have been inseparable ever since you went We are now at the  Bath  where if you are not as I heartily hope better engaged your coming would be the greatest pleasure to us in the world Talk not of Expences  Homer  shall support his Children I beg a line from you directed to the Posthouse  in  Bath  Poor  Parnelle  is in an ill state of health  Pardon me if I add a word of advice in the Poetical way Write something on the King or Prince or Princess On whatsoever foot you may be with the Court this can do no harmI shall never know where to end and am confounded in the many things I have to say to you tho' they all amount but to this that I am entirely as ever  Your  c  London  Nov  Dear Sir  I AM extremely glad to find by a Letter of your's to Mr  Fortescue  that you have receiv'd one from me and I beg you to keep as the greatest of Curiosities that Letter of mine which you receiv'd and I never writ  But the Truth is that we were made here to expect you in a short time that I was upon the Ramble most part of the Summer and have concluded the Season in Grief for the death of my poor father  I shall not enter into a detail of my Concerns and Troubles for two reasons because I am really afflicted and need no Airs of grief and because they are not the concerns and troubles of any but my self But I think you without too great a compliment enough my friend to be pleas'd to know he died easily without a groan or the sickness of two minutes in a word as silently and peacefully as he lived  Sic mihi contingat vivere sicque mori  I am not in the humour to say gay things nor in the affectation of avoiding them I can't pretend to entertain either Mr  Pulteney  or you as you have done both my Lord  Burlington  and me by your letter to Mr  Lowndes  I am only sorry you have no greater quarrel to Mr  Lowndes  and wish you paid some hundreds a year to the Landtax That Gentleman is lately become an inoffensive person to me too so that we may join heartily in our Addresses to him and like true Patriots rejoice in all that Good done to the Nation and Government to which we contribute nothing our selves  I should not forget to acknowledge your letter sent from  Aix  you told me then that writing was not good with the Waters  and I find since you are of my opinion that 'tis as bad without the Waters But I fancy it is not writing but thinking that is so bad with the Waters and then you might write without any manner of prejudice if you writ like our Brotherpoets of these days  I have no story to tell that is worth your hearing you know I am no man of Intrigue but the Duchess of  Hamilton  has one which she says is worth my hearing that relates to Mr  Pulteney  and your self and which she promises if you won't tell me she will Her Grace has won in a Raffle a very fine Tweezercase at the sight of which my Tweezercase and all other Tweezercases on the globe  Hide their diminish'd Heads  That Dutchess Lord  Warwick  Lord  Stanhope  Mrs  Bellenden  Mrs  Lepell  and I can't tell who else had your letters Dr  Arbuthnot  and I expect to be treated like Friends I would send my services to Mr  Pulteney  but that he is out of favour at Court and make some compliment to Mrs  Pulteney  if she were not a Wig My Lord  Burlington  tells me she has as much outshin'd all the  French  Ladies as she did the  English  before I am sorry for it because it will be detrimental to our holy Religion if heretical Women should eclypse those  Nuns and orthodox Beauties in whose eyes alone lie all the hopes we can have of gaining such fine Gentlemen as you to our Church  Your  c  I wish you joy of the birth of the young Prince because he is the only Prince we have from whom you have had no Expectations and no Disappointments  Dear Sir  I Think it obliging in you to desire an account of my health The truth is I have never been in a worse state in my life and find whatever I have try'd as a remedy so ineffectual that I give myself entirely over I wish your health may be set perfectly right by the Waters and be assured I not only wish that and every thing else for you as common friends wish but with a Zeal not usual among those we call so I am always glad to hear often from you always glad to see you whatever accidents amusements have interven'd to make me do either less than usual I not only frequently think of you but constantly do my best to make others do it by mentioning  you to all your acquaintance I desire you to do the same for me to those you are now with do me what you think Justice in regard to those who are my friends and if there are any whom I have unwillingly deserved so little of as to be my Enemies I don't desire you to forfeit their opinion or your own judgment in any case Let Time convince those who know me not that I am an inoffensive person tho' to say truth I don't care how little I am indebted to Time for the World is hardly worth living in at least to one that is never to have health a week together I have been made to expect Dr  Arbuthnot  in town this fortnight or else I had written to him If he by never writing to me seems to forget me I consider I do the same seemingly to him and yet I don't believe he has a more sincere friend in the world than I am therefore I will think him mine I am His Mr  Congreve  's and  Your  c  London  Sept  Dear Gay  I Thank you for remembring me I would do my best to forget my self but that  I find your Idea is so closely connected to me that I must forget both together or neither I'm sorry I could not have a glympse either of you or of the Sun your Father before you went for  Bath  But now it pleases me to see him and hear of you Pray put Mr  Congreve  in mind that he has one on this side of the World who loves him and that there are more Men and Women in the Universe than Mr  Gay  and my Lady Duchess of  M  There are Ladies in and about  Richmond  that pretend to value him and your self and one of 'em at least may be thought to do it without Affectation namely Mrs  Howard  As for Mrs  Blounts  whom you mercifully make mention of they are gone or going to  Sussex  I hope Mrs  Pulteney  is the better for the  Bath  tho' I have little Charity and few good Wishes for the Ladies the Destroyers of their best friends the Men Pray tell her she has forgot the first Commissson I ever troubled her with and therefore it shall be the last the very thing I fear the desires Dr  Arbuthnot  is a strange creature he goes out of town and leaves his Bastards at other folks doors I have long been so far mistaken in him as to think him a Man of Morals as well as of Politicks Pray let him know I made a very unfashionable enquiry t'other day of the welfare  of his Wife and family Things that I presume are below the consideration of a Wit and an  Omore  player They are in perfect health Tho' Mrs  A  's Navel has been burnt I hope the Doctor's own Belly is in absolute ease and contentment Now I speak of those Regions about the  Abdomen  pray dear  Gay  consult with him and Dr  Che e  to what exact pitch yours may be suffer'd to swell not to outgrow theirs who are yet your Betters Pray tell Dr  Arbuthnot  that even Pigeonpyes and Hogspuddings are thought dangerous by our Governors for those that have been sent to the Bishop of  Rochester  are open'd and prophanely pry'd into at the  Tower  'Tis the first time dead Pigeons have been suspected of carrying Intelligence To be serious you and Mr  Congreve  nay and the Doctor if he has not dined will be sensible of my concern and surprize at the commitment of that Gentleman whose welfare is as much my concern as any friend's I have I think my self a most unfortunate wretch I no sooner love and upon knowledge fix my esteem to any man but he either dies like Mr  Craggs  or is s nt to Imprisonment like the Bishop God send him as well as I wish him manifest him to be as innocent as I believe him and make all his Enemies know him as well as I do that  they may love him and think of him as well  If you apprehend this Period to be of any danger in being address'd to you tell Mr  Congreve  or the Doctor it is writ to them I am  Your  c  July  Dear Sir  I WAS very much pleas'd not to say oblig'd by your kind letter which sufficiently warm'd my heart to have answer'd it sooner had I not been deceiv'd a way one often is deceiv'd by hearkening to Women who told me that both Lady  Burlington  and yourself were immediately to return from  Tunbridge  and that my Lord was gone to bring you back The world furnishes us with too many examples of what you complain of in yours and I assure you none of them touch and grieve me so much as what relates to you I think your Sentiments upon it are the very same I should entertain I wish those we call Great Men had the same Notions but they are really the most Little Creatures in the world and the most interested in all but one Point which is that they want Judgment  to know their greatest Interest to encourage and chuse Honest men for their Friends  I have not once seen the Person you complain of whom I have of late thought to be as the Apostle admonisheth  one Flesh with his Wife  Pray make my sincere compliments to Lord  Burlington  whom I have long known to have more Mind to be a Good and honourable man than almost any one of his rank  I have not forgot yours to Lord  Bolingbroke  tho' I hope to have speedily a fuller opportunity he returns for  Flanders  and  France  next Month  Mrs  Howard  has writ you something or other in a letter which she says she repents She has as much Goodnature as if she had never seen any Illnature and had been bred among Lambs and Turtledoves instead of Princes and CourtLadies  By the end of this week  Fortescue  will pass a few days with me We shall remember you in our Potations and wish you a Fisher with us on my Grassplat In the mean time we wish you Success as a Fisher of Women at the Wells a Rejoycer of the Comfortless and Widow an Impregnator of the Barren and a Playfellow of the Maiden I am  Your  c  Dear Sir  I Faithfully assure you in the midst of that melancholy with which I have been so long encompassed in an hourly Expectation almost of my Mother's death there was no circumstance that render'd it more insupportable to me than that I could not leave her to see you Your own present Escape from so imminent danger I pray God may prove less precarious than my poor Mother's can be whose Life at her age can at best be but a short Reprieve or a longer Dying But I fear even that is more than God will please to grant me for these two days past her most dangerous Symptoms are returned upon her and unless there be a sudden change I must in a few days if not in a few Hours be depriv'd of her In the afflicting Prospect before me I know nothing that can so much alleviate it as the View now given me Heaven grant it may encrease of your recovery In the sincerity of my heart I am excessively concern'd not to be able to pay you dear  Gay  any part of the debt I very gratefully remember I owe you on a like sad occasion when you was here comforting me in her last great Illness May your  health augment as fast as I fear it pleases God hers must decline I believe that would be very fastmay the Life that is added to you be past in good fortune and tranquillity rather of your own giving to your self than from any Expectations or Trust in othersMay you and I live together without wishing more felicity or acquisitions than Friendship can give and receive without obligations to GreatnessGod keep you and three or four more of those I have known as long that I may have something worth the surviving my Mother Adieu dear  Gay  and believe me while you live and while I live  Your  c  As I told you in my last letter I repeat it in this Do not think of writing to me The Doctor Mrs  Howard  and Mrs  Blount  give me daily accounts of you  Sunday Night  Dear Sir  I Truly rejoyc'd to see your handwriting tho' I fear'd the trouble it might give you I wish I had not known that you are still so excessively weak Every day for  a week past I had hopes of being able in a day or two more to see you But my poor Mother advances not at all gains no strength and seems but upon the whole to wait for the next cold Day to throw her into a Diarrhoea that must if it return carry her off This being daily to be fear'd makes me not dare to go a day from her lest that should prove to be her Last God send you a speedy recovery and such a total one as at your time of Life may be expected You need not call the few Words I writ to you either kind or good That was and is nothing But whatever I have in my Nature of Kindness I really have for you and whatever Good I could do I wou'd among the very first be glad to do to you In your circumstance the old  Roman  farewell is proper  Vive memor nostri  Your  c  I send you a very kind letter of Mr  Digby  between whom and me two letters have pass'd concerning you  Dear Gay  NO words can tell you the great concern I feel for you I assure you it  was not and is not lessen'd by the immediate apprehension I have now every day Jain under of losing my Mother Be assur'd no Duty less than that should have kept me one day from attending your condition I would come and take a Room by you at  Hampstead  to be with you daily were she not still in danger of death I have constantly had particular accounts of you from the Doctor which have not ceas'd to alarm me yet God preserve your life and restore your health I really beg it for my own sake for I feel I love you more than I thought in health tho' I always lov'd you a great deal If I am so unfortunate as to bury my poor Mother and yet have the good fortune to have my prayers heard for you I hope we may live most of our remaining days together If as I believe the air of a better clime as the Southern Part of  France  may be thought useful for your recovery thither I would go with you infallibly and it is very probable we might get the Dean with us who is in that abandon'd state already in which I shall shortly be as to other Cares and Duties Dear  Gay  be as chearful as your Sufferings will permit God is a better friend than a Court Even any honest man is a better I promise you my entire friendship  in all events heartily praying for your recovery  Your  c  Do not write if you are ever so able The Doctor tells me all  Dear Sir  I AM glad to hear of the progress of your recovery and the oftner I hear it the better when it becomes easy to you to give it me I so well remember the Consolation you were to me in my Mother's former Illness that it doubles my Concern at this time not to be able to be with you or you able to be with me Had I lost her I wou'd have been no where else but with you during your confinement I have now past five weeks without once going from home and without any company but for three or four of the days Friends rarely stretch their kindness so far as ten miles My Lord  Bolingbroke  and Mr  Bethel  have not forgotten to visit me the rest except Mrs  Blount  once were contented to send messages I never pass'd so melancholy a time and now Mr  Congreve  's death touches me nearly It is twenty years that I have known him Every year carries away something  dear with it till we outlive all tendernesses and become wretched Individuals again as we begun Adieu This is my Birthday and this is my Reflection upon it  With added Days if life give nothing new  But like a Sieve let ev'ry Pleasure thro'  Some Joy still lost as each vain Year runs o'er  And all we gain some sad Reflection more  Is this a Birthday'Tis alas too clear  'Tis but the Funeral of the former Year  I am Yours  c  Twick'nam  July  Dear Gay  YOU have the same share in my memory that good things generally have I always know whenever I reflect that you should be in my mind only I reflect too seldom However you ought to allow me the Indulgence I allow all my Friends and if I did not They would take it in consideration that they have other avocations which may prevent the  Proofs  of their remembring me tho' they preserve for me all the friendship and goodwill which I deserve from them In like manner I expect from you that my past life  of twenty years may be set against the omission of perhaps one month And if you complain of this to any other 'tis you are in the spleen and not I in the wrong If you think this letter splenatick consider I have just receiv'd the News of the death of a Friend whom I esteem'd almost as many years as you poor  Fenton  He died at  Easthamstead  of Indolence and Inactivity let it not be your fate but use Exercise I hope the Duchess will take care of you in this respect and either make you gallop after her or teize you enough at home to serve instead of Exercise abroad Mrs  Howard  is so concern'd about you and so angry at me for not writing to you and at Mrs  Blount  for not doing the same that I am piqu'd with Jealousy and Envy at you and hate you as much as if you had a great Place at Court which you will confess a proper cause of Envy and Hatred in any Poetmilitant or unpension'd But to set matters even I own I love you and own I am as I ever was and just as I ever shall be  Yours  c  Twickenham  Oct  Dear Sir  I HAVE many years ago magnify'd in my own mind and repeated to you a ninth Beatitude added to the eight in the Scripture  Blessed is he who expects nothing for he shall never be disappointed  I could find in my heart to congratulate you on this happy dismission from all CourtDependance I dare say I shall find you the Better and the Honester Man for it many years hence very probably the healthfuller and the chearfuller into the bargain You are happily rid of many cursed ceremonies as well as of many ill and vicious habits of which few or no men escape the Infection who are hackney'dand tramelled in the ways of a court Princes indeed and Peers the Lackies of Princes and Ladies the Fools of Peers will smile on you the less but Men of Worth and real Friends will look on you the better There is a thing the only thing which Kings and Queens cannot give you for they have it not to give  Liberty  which is worth all they have and which as yet I hope  Englishmen  need not ask from their hands You will enjoy That and your own Integrity and the satisfactory  Consciousness of having  not  merited such Graces from them as they bestow only on the mean servile flattering interested and undeserving The only Steps to their favour are such complacencies such compliances such distant decorums as delude them in their Vanities or engage them in their Passions He is their  Greatest  favourite who is their  Falsest  and when a man by such vile Gradations arrives at the height of Grandeur and Power he is then at best but in a circumstance to be  hated  and in a condition to be  hanged  for serving their Ends So many a Minister has found it  I believe you did not want Advice in the letter you sent by my Lord  Grantham  I presume you writ it not without And you cou'd not have better if I guess right at the person who agreed to your doing it in respect to any  Decency  you ought to observe for I take that person to be a perfect Judge of Decencies and Forms I am not without fears even on that person's account I think it a bad Omen but what have I to do with CourtOmensDear  Gay  adieu I can only add a plain uncourtly Speech While you are no body's Servant you may be any one's Friend and as such I embrace you in all conditions of life While I have a shilling you shall have sixpence nay eight  pence if I can contrive to live upon a groat I am faithfully  Your  c  Aug  Dear Gay  IF my friendship were as effectual as it is sincere you would be one of those people who would be vastly advantag'd and enrich'd by it I ever honour'd those Popes who were most famous for Nepotism 'tis a sign that the old fellows  loved Somebody  which is not usual in such advanced years And I now honour Sir  Robert Walpole  for his extensive Bounty and Goodness to his private Friends and Relations But it vexes me to the heart when I reflect that my friendship is so much less effectual than theirs nay so utterly useless that it cannot give you any thing not even a Dinner at this distance nor help the General whom I greatly love to catch one fish My only consolation is to think you happier than myself and to begin to envy you which is next to hating an excellent Remedy for Love How comes it that Providence has been so unkind to me who am a greater object of compassion than any fat man alive that I am forc'd to drink wine while you  riot in water prepar'd with oranges by the hand of the Duchess of  Queensberry  that I am condemn'd to live on a Highway side like an old Patriarch receiving all Guests where my Portico as  Virgil  has it  Mane salutantum totis vomit aedibus undam  while you are rapt into the  Idalian  Groves sprinkled with Rosewater and live in Burrage Balm and Burnet up to the chin with the Duchess of  Queensberry  that I am doom'd to the drudgery of dining at Court with the Ladies in waiting at  Windsor  while you are happily banish'd with the Duchess of  Queensberry  So partial is Fortune in her dispensations for I deserv'd ten times more to be banish'd than you and I know some Ladies who merit it better than even her Grace After this I must not name any who dare do so much for you as to send you their Services But one there is who exhorts me often to write to you I suppose to prevent or excuse her not doing it herself she seems for that is all I'll say for a Courtier to wish you mighty well Another who is no Courtier frequently mentions you and does certainly wish you wellI fancy after all they both do so  I writ to Mr  Fortescue  and told him the pains you took to see him Dr  A  for all  that I know may yet remember you and me but I never hear of it The Dean is well I have had many accounts of him from  Irish  Evidence but only two Letters these four months in both which you are mentioned kindly He is in the North of  Ireland  doing I know not what with I know not whom  Cleland  always speaks of you he is at  Tunbridge  wondring at the superior Carnivoracity of the Dr He plays now with the old Duchess of  M  nay dines with her after she has won all his money Other News know I not but that Counsellor  Bickford  has hurt himself and has the strangest walkingstaff I ever saw He intends speedily to make you a visit at  Amesbury  I am my Lord Duke's my Lady Duchess's Mr  Dormer  's General  Dormer  's and  Your  c  Sept  Dear Sir  I May with great Truth return your Speech that I think of you daily oftner indeed than is consistent with the character of a reasonable man who is rather to make himself easy with the things and men that are about him than uneasy  with those which are not And you whose Absence is in a manner perpetual to me ought rather to be remembred as a good man gone than breathed after as one living You are taken from us here to be laid up in a more blessed state with Spirits of a higher kind such I reckon his Grace and her Grace since their Banishment from an earthly Court to an heavenly one in each other and their friends for I conclude none but true friends will consort or associate with them afterwards I can't but look upon myself so unworthy as a man of  Twitnam  seems to be rank'd with such rectify'd and sublimated Beings as you as a separated Spirit too from Courts and Courtly Fopperies But I own not altogether so divested of terrene Matter nor altogether so spiritualized as to be worthy admission to your Depths of Retirement and Contentment I am tugg'd back to the world and its regards too often and no wonder when my retreat is but ten miles from the Capital I am within Earshot of Reports within the Vortex of Lyes and Censures I hear sometimes of the Lampooners of Beauty the Calumniators of Virtue the Jokers at Reason and Religion I presume these are creatures and things as unknown to you as we of this dirty Orb are to the Inhabitants of the  Planet  Jupiter  Except a few fervent prayers reach you on the wings of the post from two or three of your zealous Votaries at this distance as one Mrs  Howard  who lists up her heart now and then to you from the midst of the  Colluvies  and Sink of Human Greatness at  W  r  One Mrs  B  that fancies you may remember her while you liv'd in your mortal and too transitory State at  Petersham  One Lord  B  who admir'd the Duchess before she grew quite a Goddess and a few others  To descend now to tell you what are our Wants our Complaints and our Miseries here I must seriously say the Loss of any one Good woman is too great to be born easily and poor Mrs  Rollinson  tho' a private woman was such Her Husband is gone into  Oxfordshire  very melancholy and thence to the  Bath  to  live on  for such is our Fate and Duty Adeiu Write to me as often as you will and to encourage you I will write as seldom as if you did not Believe me  Your  c  Oct  Dear Sir  I AM something like the Sun at this Season withdrawing from the World but meaning it mighty well and resolving to shine whenever I can again But I fear the Clouds of a long Winter will overcome me to such a degree that any body will take a farthingcandle for a better Guide and more serviceable companion My Friends may remember my brighter days but will think like the  Irishman  that the  Moon  is a better thing when once I am gone I don't say this with any allusion to my Poetical capacity as a Son of  Apolio  but in my Companionable one if you'll suffer me to use a phrase of the Earl of  Clarendon  's For I shall see or be seen of few of you this Winter I am grown too faint to do any good or to give any pleasure I not only as  Dryden  fairly says  Feel my Notes decay  as a Poet but feel my Spirits flag as a Companion and shall return again to where I first began my Books I have been putting my Library in order and enlarging the Chimney in it with equal intention to warm my Mind and Body if I can to some Life A Friend  a Womanfriend God help me with whom I have spent three or four hours a day these fifteen years advised me to pass more time in my studies I reflected she must have found some Reason for this admonition and concluded she wou'd compleat all her kindnesses to me by returning me to the Employment I am fittest for Conversation with the dead the old and the wormeaten  Judge therefore if I might not treat you as a Beatify'd Spirit comparing your life with my stupid state For as to my living at  Windsor  with Ladies  c  it is all a dream I was there but two nights and all the day out of that company I shall certainly make as little Court to others as they do to me and that will be none at all My FairWeatherFriends of the Summer are going away for  London  and I shall see Them and the Butterflies together if I live till next Year which I would not desire to do if it were only for their sakes But we that are writers ought to love Posterity that Posterity may love us and I would willingly live to see the Children of the present Race meerly in hope they may be a little wiser than their Parents  I am  c  To J GAY  Esq  Dec  I Am astonished at the Complaints occasion'd by a late  Epistle  to the  Earl  of  Burlington  and I should be afflicted were there the least just Ground for 'em Had the Writer attack'd  Vice  at a Time when it is not only tolerated but triumphant and so far from being concealed as a  Defect  that it is proclaimed with Ostentation as a  Merit  I should have been apprehensive of the Consequence Had he satirized Gamesters of a hundred thousand pounds Fortune acquired by such Methods as are in daily practice and almost universally encouraged Had he overwarmly desended the  Religion of his Country  against such Books as come from every Press are publickly vended in every Shop and greedily bought by almost every Rank of Men or had he called our excellent  Weekly Writers  by the same Names which they openly bestow on the greatest Men  in  the Ministry and  out  of the Ministry for which they are all unpunished and most rewarded  In any of these Cases indeed I might have judged him too presumptuous and perhaps have trembled for his Rashness  I could not but hope better for this small and modest Epistle which attacks  no one Vice  whatsoever which deals only in  Folly  and not Folly in general but a single Species of it that only Branch for the opposite Excellency to which the Noble Lord to whom it is written must necessarily be celebrated I fancied it might escape Censure especially seeing how tenderly these Follies are treated and really less accused than Apologized for  Yet hence the Poor are cloath'd the Hungry fed  Health to himself and to his Infants Bread  The Lab'rer bears  Is this such a  Crime  that to impute it to a Man must be a grievous Offence 'Tis an  Innocent Folly  and much more  Beneficent  than the Want of it for  Ill Taste  employs more hands and diffuses Expence more than a  Good  one Is it a  Moral  Defect No it is but a  Natural  one a  Want of Taste  It is what the best good Man living may be liable to The worthiest Peer may live exemplarily in an illfavour'd House and the best reputed Citizen be pleased with a vile Garden I thought I say the Author had  the common Liberty to observe a Defect and to compliment a Friend for a Quality that distinguishes him which I know not how any Quality should do if we were not to remark that it was wanting in others  But they say the Satire is  Personal  I thought it could not be so because all its Reflexions are on  Things  His Reflexions are not on the  Man  but his House Garden  c  Nay he respects as one may say the  Persons  of the Gladiator Amphitheatre the Nile and the Triton He is only sorry to see them as he might be to see any of his  Friends  ridiculous by being in the wrong Place and in bad Company Some fancy that to say a Thing is  Personal  is the same as to say it is  Unjust  not considering that nothing can be  Just  that is not  Personal  I am afraid that  "all such Writings and Discourses as  touch no Man  will  mend no Man  "  The GoodNatured indeed are apt to be alarmed at any thing like Satire and the  Guilty  readily concur with the  Weak  for a plain Reason because the Vicious look upon Folly as their  Frontier  Jam proximus ardet  Ucalegon    No wonder those who know Ridicule belongs to them find an inward Consolation  in removing it from themselves as far as they can and it is never so far as when they can get it fixed on the  best Characters  No wonder those who are Food for Satirists should rail at them as Creatures of  every Beast born for our Use would be ready to call a Man so  I know no Remedy unless people in our Age would as little frequent the Theatres as they begin to do the Churches unless Comedy were forsaken Satire silent and every man left to do what seems good in his own Eyes as if there were no King no Priest no Poet in  Israel  But I find myself obliged to touch a Point on which I must be more serious it well deserves I should I mean the malicious Application of the Character of  Timon  which I will boldly say they would impute to the Person the most different in the World from a  Manhater  and the Person whose  Taste  and  Encouragement  of  Wit  have often been shewn in the  rightest Place  The Author of that Epistle must certainly think so if he has the same Opinion of his own Merit as Authors generally have for he has been favoured by this very Person  Why in God's Name must a  Portrait  apparently collected from twenty different Men be applied to one only Has it his  Eye  No it is very unlike Has it his  Nose  or  Mouth  No they are totally differing What then I beseech you Why it has the  Mole on his Chin  Very well but must the Picture therefore be his and has no other man that Blemish  Could there be a more melancholy Instance how much the Taste of the Publick is vitiated and turns the most salutary and seasonable Physick into Poison than if amidst the Blaze of a thousand bright Qualities in a Great Man they should only remark there is a  Shadow  about him as what Eminence is without I am confident the Author was incapable of imputing any such to One whose whole Life to use his own Expression in Print of him is  a continued Series  of good and generous Actions  I know no man who would be more concerned if he gave the least Pain or Offence to any innocent Person and none who would be less concerned if the Satire were challenged by any one at whom he would really aim it If ever that happens I dare engage he will own it with all the Freedom of one whose  Censures  are  just  and who sets his  Name  to them  To the Earl of  Burlington  March  My LORD  THE Clamour rais'd about my Epistle to you could not give me so much pain as I receiv'd pleasure in seeing the general Zeal of the world in the cause of a great Man who is Beneficent and the particular Warmth of your Lordship in that of a private Man who is innocent  It was not the  Poem  that deserv'd this from you for as I had the Honour to be your Friend I cou'd not treat you quite like a Poet but sure the  Writer  deserv'd more Candor even from those who knew him not than to promote a Report which in regard to that Noble Person was  Impertinent  in regard to me  Villainous  Yet I had no great cause to wonder that a Character belonging to  twenty  shou'd be applied to  one  since by that means  nineteen  wou'd escape the Ridicule  I was too well content with my Knowledge of that Noble Person's Opinion in this Affair to trouble the publick about it But  since Malice and Mistake are so long a

theirs must be of the latter His Humanity feels a Concern for the Injury done to  Me  while his Greatness of Mind can bear with Indifference the Insult offer'd to  Himself  Alludes to the Letter the Duke of  Ch  wrote to Mr  Pope  on this occasion a Copy of which together with Mr  Pope  's to his Grace we hope to procure for the next Volume  However my Lord I own that Critics of  this Sort  can intimidate me nay half incline me to write no more That wou'd be making the Town a Compliment which I think it deserves and which some I am sure wou'd take very kindly This way of Satire is dangerous as long as Slander rais'd by Fools of the lowest Rank can find any countenance from those of a Higher Even from the Conduct shewn on this occasion I have learnt there are some who wou'd rather be  wicked  than  ridiculous  and therefore it may be safer to attack  Vices  than  Follies  I will therefore leave my Betters in the quiet Possession of their  Idols  their  Groves  and their  HighPlaces  and change my Subject from  their  Pride  to their  Meanness  from their  Vanities  to their  Miseries  And as the only certain way to avoid Misconstructions to lessen Offence and not to multiply

am  my Lord  Your Faithful Affectionate Servant A POPE  Dr ARBUTHNOT to Mr POPE  Hampstead  July  Dear Sir  I Little doubt of your kind Concern for me nor of that of the Lady you mention I have nothing to repay my Friends with at present but prayers and good wishes I have the satisfaction to find that I am as officiously serv'd by my Friends as he that has thousands to leave in Legacies besides the Assurance of their Sincerity  God Almighty has made my bodily distress as easy as a thing of that nature can be I have found some relief at least sometimes from the Air of this Place My Nights are bad but many poor Creatures have worse  As for you my good Friend I think since our first acquaintance there has not been any of those little Suspicions or Jealousies that often affect the sincerest Friendships I am sure not on my side I must be so sincere as to own that tho' I could not help valuing you for those Talents which the World prizes yet they were not the Foundation of my Friendship They were quite of another sort nor shall I at present offend you by enumerating them And I make it my Last Request that you continue that noble  Disdain  and  Abhorrence  of Vice which you seem naturally endu'd with but still with a due regard to your own Safety and study more to reform than chastise tho' the one often cannot be effected without the other  Lord  Bathurst  I have always honour'd for every good Quality that a Person of his Rank ought to have Pray give my Respects and kindest Wishes to the Family My Venison Stomach is gone but I have those about me and often with me who will be very glad of his Present If it is left  at my house it will be transmitted safe to me  A Recovery in my Case and at my Age is impossible the kindest Wish of my Friends is  Euthanasia  Living or dying I shall always be  Your most faithful Friend And humble Servant JO ARBUTHNOT  LETTERS OF Mr POPE to H C  Esq  From to  March  I Believe it was with me when I left the Town as it is with a great many Men when they leave the World whose loss itself they do not so much regret as that of their Friends whom they leave behind in it For I do not know one thing for which I can envy  London  but for your continuing there Yet I guess you  will expect I should recant this Expression when I tell you that  Sapho  by which heathenish Name you have christen'd a very orthodox Lady did not accompany me into the Country However I will confess myself the less concern'd on that account because I have no very violent Inclination to lose my Heart especially in so wild and savage a place as this Forest is In the Town 'tis ten to one but a young Fellow may find his stray'd Heart again with some  Wildstreet  or  Drurylane  Damfel but here where I could have met with no redress from an unmerciful virtuous Dame I must for ever have lost my little Traveller in a Hole where I could never rummage to find him againWell Sir you have your Lady in the Town still and I have my Heart in the Country still which being wholly unemploy'd as yet has the more room in it for my Friends and does not want a Corner at your ServiceTo be serious you have extremely oblig'd me by your Frankness and Kindness to me And if I have abus'd it by too much Freedom on my part I hope you will attribute it to the natural Openness of my Temper which hardly knows how to show Respect where I feel Affection I wou'd love my Friend as my Mistress without Ceremony and hope a little rough Usage  sometimes may not be more displeasing to the one than it is to the other  If you have any Curiosity to know in what manner I live or rather lose a Life  Martial  will inform you in one Line the Translation of which cost a Friend of ours three in  English  One short one long  One soft one strong  One right one wrong  Prandeo poto cano ludo lego caeno quiesco  Every Day with me is literally another yesterday for it is exactly the same It has the same Business which is Poetry and the same Pleasure whieh is Idleness A man might indeed pass his Time much better but I question if any Man could pass it much easier If you will visit our Shades this Spring which I very much desire you may perhaps instruct me to manage my Game more wisely but at present I am satisfy'd to trifle away my Time any Way rather than let it stick by me as Shopkeepers are glad to be rid of those Goods at any rate which would otherwise always be lying upon their hands  Sir if you will favour me sometimes with your Letters it will be a great Satisfaction  to me on several accounts and on this in particular That it will show me to my Comfort that even a wise Man is sometimes very idle for so you must needs be when you can find leisure to write to  Your  c  April  I Have nothing to say to you in this Letter but I was resolv'd to write to tell you so Why should not I content myself with so many great Examples of deep Divines profound Casuists grave Philosophers who have written not Letters only but whole Tomes and voluminous Treatises about Nothing Why shou'd a Fellow like me who all his life does nothing be asham'd to write nothing and that to one who has nothing to do but to read it But perhaps you'll say the whole World has something to do something to talk of something to wish for something to be imploy'd about But pray Sir cast up the Account put all these Somethings together and what is the Sum Total but just Nothing I have no more to say but to desire to give you my Service that  is nothing to your Friends and to believe that I am nothing more than  Your  c  Ex nihilo nil fit  LUCR  May  YOU talk of Fame and Glory and of the great Men of Antiquity Pray tell me what are all your great dead Men but so many little living Letters What a vast Reward is here for all the Ink wasted by Writers and all the Blood spilt by Princes There was in old time one  Severus  a  Roman  Emperor I dare say you never call'd him by any other Name in your Life and yet in his days he was styl'd  Lucius Septimius Severus Pius Pertinax Augustus Parthicus Adiabenicus Arabicus Maximus  and what not What a prodigious waste of Letters has Time made what a Number have here dropt off and lest the poor surviving Seven unattended For my own part Four are all I have to take care for and I'll be judg'd by you if any man cou'd live in less compass except it were one Monsieur  D  and one  Romulus  ⁂ But these contrary to the common Calamity came in  process of time to be call'd Monsieur  Boileau Despreaux  and  Romulus Threepoints  Well Sir for the future I'll drown all high Thoughts in the  Lethe  of CowslipWine as for Fame Renown Reputation take 'em Critics  Tradam protervis in mare  Criticum  Ventis  If ever I seek for Immortality here may I be d  d for there's not so much danger in a  Poet  's being damn'd  Damnation follows Death in other Men  But your damn'd Poet lives and writes agen  November  I Have been so well satisfy'd with the Country ever since I saw you that I have not so much as once thought of the Town or enquir'd of any one in it besides Mr  Wycherley  and yourself And from him I understand of your Journey this Summer into  Leicestershire  from whence I guess you are return'd by this time to your old Apartment in the Widow's Corner to your old Business of comparing Critics and reconciling  reconciling commentators and to the old diversions of a losing game at Picquet with the ladies and half a play or a quarter of a play at the theatre where you are none of the malicious Audience but the chief of amorous Spectators and for the infirmity of one  His Hearing  Sense which there for the most part could only serve to disgust you enjoy the vigour of another which ravishes you  You know when one Sense is supprest  It but retires into the rest  According to the poetical not the learned  Dodwell  who has done one thing worthy of eternal memory wrote two lines in his life that are not nonsense So you have the advantage of being entertain'd with all the beauty of the Boxes without being troubled with any of the dulness of the Stage You are so good a critic that 'tis the greatest happiness of the modern Poets that you do not hear their works and next that you are not so arrant a critic as to damn them like the rest without hearing But now I talk of those critics I have good news to tell you concerning myself for which I expect you shou'd congratulate with me It is that beyond all my expectations and  far above my demerits I have been most mercifully repriev'd by the sovereign power of  Jacob Tonson  from being brought forth to publick punishment and respited from time to time from the hands of those barbarous executioners of the Muses whom I was just now speaking of It often happens that guilty Poets like other guilty criminals when once they are known and proclaim'd deliver themselves into the hands of Justice only to prevent others from doing it more to their disadvantage and not out of any Ambition to spread their fame by being executed in the face of the world which is a fame but of short continuance That Poet were a happy man who cou'd but obtain a grant to preserve his for ninetynine years for those names very rarely last so many days which are planted either in  Jacob Tonson  's or the  Ordinary of Newgate  's Miscellanies  I have an hundred things to say to you which shall be deferr'd till I have the happiness of seeing you in town for the season now draws on that invites every body thither Some of them I had communicated to you by Letters before this if I had not been uncertain were you pass'd your time the last season so much fine weather I doubt not has given you all the pleasure you cou'd desire from the country  and your own thoughts the best company in it But nothing cou'd allure Mr  Wycherley  to our Forest he continu'd as you told me long since he wou'd an obstinate lover of the town in spite of friendship and fair weather Therefore henceforward to all those considerable qualities I know you possest of I shall add that of Prophecy But I still believe Mr  Wycherley  's intentions were good and am satisfy'd that he promises nothing but with a real design to perform it how much soever his other excellent qualities are above my imitation his sincerity I hope is not and it is with the utmost that I am  Sir  c  Jan  I Had sent you the inclos'd  This was a Translation of the first Book of  Statius  done when the Author was but Years old as appears by an Advertisement before the first Edition of it in a Miscellany publish  d by  B Lintot    o      Papers before this time but that I intended to have brought them myself and afterwards cou'd find no opportunity of sending them  without suspicion of their miscarrying not that they are of the least value but for fear somebody might be foolish enough to imagine them so and inquisitive enough to discover those faults which I by your help wou'd correct I therefore beg the favour of you to let them go no farther than your chamber and to be very free of your remarks in the margins not only in regard to the accuracy but to the fidelity of the translation which I have not had time of late to compare with its original And I desire you to be the more severe as it is much more criminal for me to make another speak nonsense than to do it in my own proper person For your better help in comparing it may be fit to tell you that this is not an entire version of the first book There is an omission from the th line  Jam murmura serpunt plebis agenoreae  to the th  Interea patriis olim vagus exul ab oris  between these  These he since translated and they are extant in the printed Version  two  Statius  has a description of the council of the Gods and a speech of  Jupiter  which contain a peculiar beauty and majesty and were left out for no other reason but because the consequence  of this machine appears not till the second book The translation goes on from thence to the words  Hic vero ambobus rabiem fortuna cruentam  where there is an odd account of a battle at fiftycuffs between the two Princes on a very slight occasion and at a time when one wou'd think the fatigue of their Journey in so tempestuous a night might have render'd them very unfit for such a scuffle This I had actually translated but was very ill satisfied with it even in my own words to which an author cannot but be partial enough of conscience it was therefore omitted in this copy which goes on above eighty lines farther at the words  Hic primum lustrare oculis  cto the end of the book  You will find I doubt not that  Statius  was none of the discreetest Poets tho' he was the best versifier next  Virgil  In the very beginning he unluckily betrays his ignorance in the rules of Poetry which  Horace  had already taught the  Romans  when he asks his Muse where to begin his  Thebaid  and seems to doubt whether it should not be  ab ovo Ledaeo  When he comes to the scene of his Poem and the prize in dispute between the Brothers he gives us a very mean opinion of it  Pugna est de paupere regno  Very different from the conduct of his master  Virgil  who at the entrance of his Poem informs his reader of the greatness of its subject  Tantae molis erat Romanam condere Gentem  Bossu  on Epic Poetry  There are innumerable little faults in him among which I cannot but take notice of one in this book where speaking of the implacable hatred of the brothers he says  The whole world wou'd be too small a prize to repay so much impiety  Quid si peteretur crimine tanto  Limes uterque Poli quem Sol emissus Eoo  Cardine aut portu vergens prospectat Ibero  This was pretty well one wou'd think already but he goes on  Quasque procul terras obliquo sydere tangit  Avius aut Boreae gelidas madidive tepentes  Igne Noti  After all this what cou'd a Poet think of but Heaven itself for the Prize but what follows is astonishing  Quid si Tyriae Phrygiaeve sub unum  Convectentur Opes  I do not remember to have met with so great a fall in any antient author whatsoever I shou'd not have insisted so much on the faults of this Poet if I did not hope you wou'd take the same freedom with and revenge it upon his Translator I shall be extremely glad if the reading this can be any amusement to you the rather because I had the dissatisfaction to hear you have been confin'd to your chamber by an illness which I fear was as troublesome a companion as I have sometimes been to you in the same place where if ever you found any pleasure in my company it must surely have been that which most men take in observing the faults and follies of another a pleasure which you see I take care to give you even in my absence  If you will oblige me at your leisure with the confirmation of your recovery under your own hand it will be extreme grateful to me for next to the pleasure of seeing my friends is that I take in hearing from them and in this particular I am beyond all acknowledgments oblig'd to our friend Mr  Wycherley  who as if it were not enough to have excell'd all men in wit is resolv'd to excel them in goodnature too I know I need no apology to you for speaking of Mr  Wycherley  whose example as I am proud of following in all  things so in nothing more than in professing myself like him  Your  c  May  YOU had long before this time been troubled with a Letter from me but that I deferr'd it till I cou'd send you either the  Jacob Tonson  's sixth Volume of Poetical Miscellanies in which Mr  Pope  's Pastorals and some Versions of  Homer  and  Chaucer  were first printed  Miscellany or my continuation of the Version of  Statius  The first I imagin'd you might have had before now but since the contrary has happen'd you may draw this Moral from it That Authors in general are more ready to write nonsense than Booksellers are to publish it I had I know not what extraordinary flux of rhyme upon me for three days together in which time all the Verses you see added have been written which I tell you that you may more freely be severe upon them 'Tis a mercy I do not assault you with a number of original Sonnets and Epigrams which our modrn Bards put forth in the springtime in as great abundance as Trees do  Blossoms a very few whereof ever come to be Fruit and please no longer than just in their birth So that they make no less haste to bring their flowers of wit to the press than gardeners to bring their other flowers to the market which if they can't get off their hands in the morning are sure to die before night Thus the same reason that furnishes  CoventGarden  with those nosegays you so delight in supplies the  Muses Mercury  and  British Apollo  not to say  Jacob  's Miscellanies with Verses And it is the happiness of this age that the modern invention of printing Poems for pence apiece has brought the Nosegays of  Parnassus  to bear the same price whereby the publickspirited Mr  Henry Hills  of  Blackfryars  has been the cause of great ease and singular comfort to all the Learned who never overabounding in transitory coin should not be discontented methinks even tho' Poems were distributed  gratis  about the streets like  Bunyan  's Sermons and other pious treatises usually publish'd in a like Volume and Character  The time now drawing nigh when you use with  Sapho  to cross the Water in an Ev'ning to  SpringGarden  I hope you will have a fair opportunity of ravishing herI mean only as  Oldfox  in the  Plaindealer  says thro' the ear with your wellpenn'd  Verses I have been told of a very lucky Compliment of an Officer to his Mistress in the very same place which I cannot but set down and desire you at present to take it in good part instead of a  Latin  Quotation that it may some time or other be improv'd by your pronunciation while you walk  Solus cum Sola  in those amorous shades  When at Springgarden  Sapho  deigns t'appear  The  flow'rs  march in hervan  musk  in her rear  I wish you all the pleasures which the Season and the Nymph can afford the best Company the best Coffee and the best News you can desire And what more to wish you than this I do not know unless it be a great deal of patience to read and examine the Verses I send you and I promise you in return a great deal of deference to your judgment and an extraordinary obedience to your sentiments for the future to which you know I have been sometimes a little refractory If you will please to begin where you left off last and mark the margins as you have done in the pages immediately before which you will find corrected to your sense since your last perusal you will extremely oblige me and improve my Translation Besides those places which may deviate from the sense of the Author  it wou'd be very kind in you to observe any deficiencies in the Diction or Numbers The  Hiatus  in particular I wou'd avoid as much as possible to which you are certainly in the right to be a profess'd enemy tho' I confess I cou'd not think it possible at all times to be avoided by any writer till I found by reading  Malherbe  lately that there is scarce any throughout his Poems I thought your observation true enough to be pass'd into a Rule but not a rule without exceptions nor that ever it had been reduc'd to practise But this example of one of the most correct and best of their Poets has undeceiv'd me and confirms your opinion very strongly and much more than Mr  Dryden  's Authority who tho' he made it a rule seldom observ'd it  Your  c  June  I Have received part of the Version of  Statius  and return you my thanks for your remarks which I think to be just except where you cry out like one in  Horace  's  Art of Poetry    Pulchrè benè rectè  There I have some fears you are often if not always in the wrong  One of your objections namely on that passage  The rest revolving years shall ripen into Fate  may be well grounded in relation to its not being the exact sense of the words  See the first book of  Statius  Verse  Caetera reliquo ordine ducam  But the duration of the Action of  Statius  's poem may as well be excepted against as many things besides in him which I wonder  Bossu  has not observ'd For instead of confining his narration to  one year  it is manifestly exceeded in the very first two books The Narration begins with  Oedipus  's prayer to the  Fury  to promote discord betwixt his Sons afterward the Poet expresly describes their entrlng into the agreement of reigning a year by turns and  Polynices  takes his flight for  Thebes  on his brother's refusal to resign the throne All this is in the first book in next  Tydeus  is sent Ambassador to  Etheocles  and demands his resignation in these terms  Astriferum velox jam circulus orbem  Torsit amissae redierunt montibus umbrae  Ex quo frater inops ignota per oppida tristes  Exul agit casus  But  Bossu  himself is mistaken in one particular relating to the commencement of the Action saying in Book Cap that  Statius  opens it with  Europa  's  Rape  whereas the Poet at most only deliberates whether he shou'd or not  Unde jubetis  Ire Deae Gentisne canam primordia dirae  Sidonios raptus  c  but then expresly passes all this with a  Longa retro series  and says  Limes mihi carminis esto  Oedipodae  confusa domus  Indeed there are numberless particulars blameworthy in our Author which I have try'd to soften in the version  Dubiam{que} jugo fragor impulit Oeten  In latus geminis vix fluctibus obstitit Isthmus  is most extravagantly hyperbolical Nor did I ever read a greater piece of Tautology than  Vacua cum  solus  in Aula  Respiceres  jus omne tuum cunctos{que} Minores  Et nusquam  par  stare  caput  In the Journey of  Polynices  is some geographical error  In mediis audit duo litora campis  could hardly be for the  Isthmus  of  Corinth  is full five miles over And  Caligantes abrupto sole Mycaenas  is not consistent with what he tells us in Lib lin  "that those of  Mycaenae  came not to the war at this time because they were then in confusion by the divisions of the Brothers  Atreus  and  Thyestes  "  Now from the raising the  Greek  army against  The'es  back to the time of this journey of  Polynices  is according to  Statius  's own account three years  Yours  c  July  THE Morning after I parted from you I found myself as I had prophecy'd all alone in an uneasy StageCoach a doleful change from that agreeable company I enjoy'd the night before without the least hope of entertainment but from my last recourse in such cases a Book I then began to enter into acquaintance with the  Moralists  and had just receiv'd from them  some cold consolation for the inconveniencies of this life and the incertainty of human affairs when I perceiv'd my Vehicle to stop and heard from the side of it the dreadful news of a sick Woman preparing to enter it 'Tis not easy to guess at my mortification but being so well fortify'd with Philosophy I stood resign'd with a Stoical constancy to endure the worst of evils a sick Woman I was indeed a little comforted to find by her voice and dress that she was Young and a Gentlewoman but no sooner was her hood remov'd but I saw one of the finest faces I ever beheld and to increase my surprize heard her salute me by my name I never had more reason to accuse Nature for making me shortsighted than now when I could not recollect I had ever seen those fair eyes which knew me so well and was utterly at a loss how to address myself till with a great deal of simplicity and innocence she let me know even before I discover'd my ignorance that she was the daughter of one in our Neighbourhood lately marry'd who having been consulting her Physicians in Town was returning into the Country to try what good Air and a new Husband cou'd do to recover her My Father you must know has sometimes recommended the Study of Physick to me but I never had any ambition  to be a Doctor till this instant I ventur'd to prescribe some Fruit which I happen'd to have in the Coach which being forbidden her by her Doctors she had the more inclination to In short I tempted and she eat nor was I more like the Devil than she like  Eve  Having the good success of the 'foresaid Gentleman before my eyes I put on the Gallantry of the old Serpent and in spite of my evil Form accosted her with all the Gaiety I was master of which had so good effect that in less than an hour she grew pleasant her colour return'd and she was pleas'd to say my prescription had wrought an immediate cure In a word I had the pleasantest journey imaginable  Thus far methinks my Letter has something of the air of a Romance tho' it be true But I hope you will look on what follows as the greatest of truths That I think myself extremely oblig'd by you in all points especially for your kind and honourable Information and Advice in a matter of the utmost concern to me which I shall ever acknowledge as the highest proof at once of your friendship justice and sincerity At the same time be assur'd that Gentleman we spoke of shall never by any alteration in me discover my knowledge of his Mistake the hearty forgiving of which is the only kind of Return I can possibly  make him for so many favours And I may derive this pleasure at least from it that whereas I must otherwise have been a little uneasy to know my incapacity of returning to his Obligations I may now by bearing his Frailty exercise my Gratitude and Friendship more than Himself either is or perhaps ever will be sensible of  Ille meos primus qui me sibi junxit Amores  Abstulit ille habeat secum servetque Sepulchro  But in one thing I must confess you have yourself oblig'd me more than any man which is that you have shew'd me many of my Faults to which as you are the more an implacable Enemy by so much the more you are a kind Friend to me I cou'd be proud in revenge to find a few slips in your Verses which I read in  London  and since in the Country with more application and pleasure the thoughts are very just and you are sure not to let them suffer by the Versification If you wou'd oblige me with the trust of any thing of yours I shou'd be glad to execute any commissions you wou'd give me concerning them I am here so perfectly at leisure that nothing wou'd be so agreeable an entertainment  to me but if you will not afford me that do not deny me at least the satisfaction of your Letters as long as we are absent if you wou'd not have him very unhappy who is very sincerely  Your  c  Having a vacant space here I will fill it with a short  Ode  on  Solitude  which I found yesterday by great accident and which I find by the date was written when I was not twelve years old that you may perceive how long I have continu'd in my passion for a rural life and in the same employments of it  Happy the man whose wish and care  A few paternal Acres bound  Content to breathe his native air  In his own ground  Whose herds with milk whose fields with bread  Whose flocks supply him with attire  Whose Trees in summer yield him shade  In winter fire  Blest who can unconcern'dly find  Hours days and years slide soft away  In Health of body Peace of mind  Quiet by day  Sound sleep by night Study and Ease  Together mixt sweet Recreation  And Innocence which most does please  With Meditation  Thus let me live unseen unknown  Thus unlamented let me die  Steal from the world and not a stone  Tell where I lie  August  IF I were to write to you as often as I think of you my Letters wou'd be as bad as a Rentcharge but tho' the one be but too little for your Goodnature the other wou'd be too much for your Quiet which is one blessing Goodnature shou'd indispensably receive from mankind in return for those many it gives I have been inform'd of late how much I am indebted to that quality of yours in speaking well of me in my absence the only thing by which  you prove yourself no Wit or Critic Tho' indeed I have often thought that a friend will show just as much indulgence and no more to my faults when I am absent as he does severity to 'em when I am present To be very frank with you Sir I must own that where I receiv'd so much Civility at first I cou'd hardly have expected so much Sincerity afterwards But now I have only to wish that the last were but equal to the first and that as you have omitted nothing to oblige me so you wou'd omit nothing to improve me  I caus'd an acquaintance of mine to enquire twice of your welfare by whom I have been inform'd that you have left your speculative Angle in the Widow's Coffeehouse and bidding adieu for some time to all the  Rehearsals Reviews Gazettes  c have march'd off into  Lincolnshire  Thus I find you vary your life in the scene at least tho' not in the Action for tho' life for the most part like an old Play be still the same yet no w and then a new Scene may make it more entertaining As for myself I would not have my life a very regular Play let it be a good mery Farce a Gd's name and a fig for the critical Unities Yet on the other side I wou'd as soon write like  Durfey  as live like  T  e  whose beastly yet  merry life is if you will excuse such a similitude not unlike a Ft at once nasty and laughable For the generality of men a true modern life is like a true modern play neither Tragedy Comedy nor Farce nor one nor all of these every Actor is much better known by his having the same Face than by keeping the same Character for we change our minds as often as they can their parts and he who was yesterday  Caesar  is to day Sir  John Daw  So that one might ask the same question of a modern life that  Rich  did of a modern play  " Pray do me the favour Sir to inform me  " Is this your Tragedy or your Comedy  I have dwelt the longer upon this because I persuade myself it might be useful at a time when we have no other Theatre to divert ourselves at this great one Here is a glorious standing Comedy of Fools at which every man is heartily merry and thinks himself an unconcern'd Spectator This to our singular comfort neither my Lord Chamberlain nor the Queen herself can ever shut up or silence While that of  Drury  alas lies desolate in the profoundest peace and the melancholy prospect of the Nymphys yet lingring about its beloved avenues appears no less moving than that of the  Trojan  Dames lamenting over their ruin'd  Ilium  What now can they  hope disposiess'd of their antient seats but to serve as Captives to the insulting Victors of the  Haymarket  The afflicted subjects of  France  do not in our  Postman  so gnievously deplore the obstinacy of their arbitrary Monarch as these perishing people of  Drury  the obdurate heart of that  Pharaoh Rich  who like him disdains all Proposals of peace and accommodation Several Libels have been secretly affix'd to the great gates of his imperial palace in  Bridgesstreet  and a Memorial representing the distresses of these persons has been accidentally dropt as we are credibly inform'd by a person of quality out of his first Minister the chief Boxkeeper's pocket at a late Conference of the said Person of quality and others on the part of the Confederates and his Theatrical Majesty on his own part Of this you may expect a copy as soon as it shall be transmitted to us from a good hand As for the late Congress it is here reported that it has not been wholly ineffectual but this wants confirmation yet we cannot but hope the concurring prayers and tears of so many wretched Ladies may induce this haughty Prince to reason  I am  c  October  I MAY truly say I am more oblig'd to you this summer than to any of my Acquaintance for had it not been for the two kind letters you sent me I had been perfectly  oblitusque meorum obliviscendus illis  The only companions I had were those Muses of whom  Tully  says  Adolescentiam alunt Senectutem oblectant secundas res ornant adversis perfugium ac solatium praebent delectant domi non impediunt foris pernoctant nobiscum peregrinantur rusticantur  Which indeed is as much as ever I expected from them for the Muses if you take them as Companions are very pleasant and agreeable but whoever should be forc'd to live or depend upon 'em would find himself in a very bad condition That Quiet which  Cowley  calls the  Companion of Obscurity  was not wanting to me unless it was interrupted by those fears you so justly guess I had for our Friend's welfare 'Tis extremely kind in you to tell me the news you heard of him and you have deliver'd me from more anxiety than he imagines me capable of on his account as I am convinc'd by his long  silence However the love of some things rewards itself as of Virtue and of Mr  Wycherley  I am surpriz'd at the danger you tell me he has been in and must agree with you that our nation would have lost in him alone more wit and probity than would have remain'd for ought I know in all the rest of it My concern for his friendship will excuse me since I know you honour him so much and since you know I love him above all men if I vent a part of my uneasiness to you and tell you that there has not been wanting one to insinuate malicious untruths of me to Mr  Wycherley  which I fear may have had some effect upon him If so he will have a greater punishment for his credulity than I cou'd wish him in that fellow's acquaintance The loss of a faithful creature is something tho' of ever so contemptible an one and if I were to change my Dog for such a Man as the aforesaid I shou'd think my Dog undervalu'd who follows me about as constantly here in the country as I was us'd to do Mr  Wycherley  in the Town  Now I talk of my Dog that I may not treat of a worse subject which my spleen tempts me to I will give you some account of him a thing not wholly unprecedented since  Montaigne  to whom I am but a Dog  in comparison has done the very same thing of his Cat  Dic mihi quid melius desidiosus agam  You are to know then that as 'tis Likeness begets affection so my favourite dog is a little one a lean one and none of the finest shap'd He is not much a Spaniel in his fawning but has what might be worth any man's while to imitate from him a dumb surly sort of kindness that rather shows itself when he thinks me illus'd by others than when we walk quietly and peaceably by ourselves If it be the chief point of Friendship to comply with a friend's Motions and Inclinations he possesses this in an eminent degree he lies down when I sit and walks when I walk which is more than many good friends can pretend to witness our walk a year ago in St  James  's  Park  Histories are more full of examples of the Fidelity of Dogs than of Friends but I will not insist upon many of 'em because it is possible some may be almost as fabulous as those of  Pylades  and  Orestes  c I will only say for the honour of Dogs that the two most antient and esteemable books sacred and prophane extant  viz  the  Scripture  and  Homer  have shewn a particular regard to these animals That of  Toby  is the more remarkable because there was no manner of reason to take notice of the Dog besides the great humanity  of the Author  Homer  's account of  Ulysses  's Dog  Argus  is the most pathetick imaginable all the Circumstances consider'd and an excellent proof of the old Bard's Goodnature  Ulysses  had left him at  Ithaca  when he embark'd for  Troy  and found him at his return after twenty years which by the way is not unnatural as some Critics have said since I remember the dam of my dog was twentytwo years old when she dy'd May the omen of longaevity prove fortunate to her successor You shall have it in verse  ARGUS  When wise  Ulysses  from his native coast  Long kept by wars and long by tempests tost  Arriv'd at last poor old disguis'd alone  To all his friends and ev'n his Queen unknown  Chang'd as he was with age and toils and cares  Furrow'd his rev'rend face and white his hairs  In his own Palace forc'd to ask his bread  Scorn'd by those slaves his former bounty fed  Forgot of all his own domestick crew  The faithful Dog alone his rightful Master knew  Unfed unhous'd neglected on the clay  Like an old servant now cashier'd he lay  Touch'd with resentment of ungrateful man  And longing to behold his antient Lord again  Him when he sawhe rose and crawl'd to meet  'Twas all he cou'd and fawn'd and kiss'd his feet  Seiz'd with dumb joythen falling by his side  Own'd his returning Lord look'd up and dy'd  Plutarch  relating how the  Athenians  were oblig'd to abandon  Athens  in the time of  Themistocles  steps back again out of the way of his History purely to describe the lamentable cries and howlings of the poor Dogs they left behind He makes mention of one that follow'd his Master across the Sea to  Salamis  where he dy'd and was honour'd with a Tomb by the  Athenians  who gave the name of the  Dog  's  Grave  to that part of the Island where he was buried this respect to a dog in the most polite people of the world is very observable A modern instance of gratitude to a Dog tho' we have but few such is that the chief Order of  Denmark  now injuriously call'd the Order of the  Elephant  was instituted in memory of the fidelity of a dog nam'd  Wildbrat  to one of their Kings who had been deserted  by his subjects He gave his order this motto or to this effect which still remains  Wildbrat was faithful  Sir  William Trumbull  has told me a story which he heard from one that was present King  Charles  I being with some of his Court during his troubles a discourse arose what sort of dogs deserv'd preeminence and it being on all hands agreed to belong either to the Spaniel or Greyhound the King gave his opinion on the part of the Greyhound because said he it has all the  Goodnature  of the other without the  Fawning  A good piece of satire upon his Courtiers with which I will conclude my Discourse of Dogs Call me a Cynick or what you please in revenge for all this impertinence I will be contented provided you will but believe me when I say a bold word for a christian that of all dogs you will find none more faithful than  Your  c  April  I Had written to you sooner but that I made some scruple of sending prophane things to you in Holy week Besides our Family wou'd have been scandaliz'd to see me write who take it for granted I write nothing but ungodly Verses I assure you I  am look'd upon in the Neighbourhood for a very welldispos'd person no great Hunter indeed but a great Admirer of the noble sport and only unhappy in my want of constitution for that and Drinking They all say 'tis pity I am so sickly and I think 'tis pity they are so healthy But I say nothing that may destroy their good opinion of me I have not quoted one  Latin  Author since I came down but have learn'd without book a Song of Mr  Thomas Durfey  's who is your only Poet of tolerable reputation in this country He makes all the merriment in our Entertainments and but for him there would be so miserable a dearth of Catches that I fear they would put either the Parson or me upon making some for 'em Any man of any quality is heartily welcome to the best TopeingTable of our Gentry who can roar out some Rhapsodies of his works so that in the same manner as it was said of  Homer  to his Detractors What Dares any man speak against Him who has given so many men to  Eat  Meaning the Rhapsodists who live by repeating his verses thus may it be said of Mr  Durfey  to his Detractors Dares any one despise Him who has made so many men  Drink  Alas Sir this is a glory which neither you nor I must ever pretend to Neither you with your  Ovid  nor I with my  Statius  can amuse a whole board of Justices and extraordinary 'Squires or gain one hum of approbation or laugh of admiration These things they wou'd say are too studious they may do well enough with such as  love Reading  but give us your antient Poet Mr  Durfey  'Tis mortifying enough it must be confess'd but however let us proceed in the way that nature has directed us  Multi multa sciunt sed nemo omnia  as it is said in the Almanack Let us communicate our works for our mutual comfort send me Elegies and you shall not want Heroicks At present I have only these  Arguments in Prose  to the  Thebaid  which you claim by promise as I do your Translation of  Pars me Sulmo tenet  and the  Ring  the rest I hope for as soon as you can conveniently transcribe 'em and whatsoever orders you are pleas'd to give me shall be punctually obey'd by  Your  c  May  I Had not so long omitted to express my acknowledgments to you for so much goodnature and friendship as you lately show'd me but that I am but just return'd to my own Hermitage from Mr  Caryl  's  who has done me so many favours that I am almost inclin'd to think my Friends infect one another and that your conversation with him has made him as obliging to me as yourself I can assure you he has a sincere respect for you and this I believe he has partly contracted from me who am too full of you not to overflow upon those I converse with But I must now be contented to converse only with the Dead of this world that is to say the dull and obscure every way obscure in their intellects as well as their persons Or else have recourse to the living Dead the old Authors with whom you are so well acquainted even from  Virgil  down to  Aulus Gellius  whom I do not think a Critic by any means to be compar'd to Mr  Dennis  And I must declare positively to you that I will persist in this opinion till you become a little more civil to  Atticus  Who cou'd have imagin'd that he who had escaped all the misfortunes of his Time unhurt even by the Proscriptions of  Anthony  and  Augustus  shou'd in these days find an Enemy more severe and barbarous than those Tyrants and that Enemy the gentlest too the bestnatur'd of mortals Mr  C    Whom I must in this compare once more to  Augustus  who seem'd not more unlike himself in the Severity of one part of his life and the Clemency of the other than you  I leave you to reflect on this and hope that time which mollifies rocks and of stiff things makes limber will turn a resolute critic to a gentle reader and instead of this positive tremendous newfashion'd Mr  C  restore unto us our old acquaintance the soft beneficent and courteous Mr  C    I expect much towards the civilizing of you in your critical capacity from the innocent Air and Tranquillity of our Forest when you do me the favour to visit it In the mean time it wou'd do well by way of Preparative if you wou'd duly and constantly every morning read over a Pastoral of  Theccritus  or  Virgil  and let the Lady  Isabella  put your  Macrobius  and  Aulus Gellius  somewhere out of your way for a month or so Who knows but Travelling and long Airing in an open field may contribute more successfully to the cooling a Critic's severity than it did to the asswaging of Mr  Cheek  's Anger of old In these fields you will be secure of finding no enemy but the most faithful and affectionate of your friends  c  May  AFTER I had recover'd from a dangerous Illness which was first contracted in Town about a fortnight after my coming hither I troubled you with a letter and a paper inclos'd which you had been so obliging as to desire a sight of when last I saw you promising me in return some translations of yours from  Ovid  Since when I have not had a syllable from your hands so that 'tis to be fear'd that tho' I have escaped Death I have not Oblivion I shou'd at least have expected you to have finish'd that Elegy upon me which you told me you was upon the point of beginning when I was sick in  London  if you will but do so much for me first I will give you leave to forget me afterwards and for my own part will die at discretion and at my leisure But I fear I must be forc'd like many learned Authors to write my own Epitaph if I wou'd be remember'd at all  Monsieur de la Fontaine  's wou'd fit me to a hair but it is a kind of Sacrilege do you think it is not to steal Epitaphs In my present living dead condition nothing wou'd be properer than  Oblitusque meorum obliviscendus illis  but that unluckily I can't forget my friends and the civilities I receiv'd from yourself  and some others They say indeed 'tis one quality of generous minds to forget the obligations they have conserr'd and perhaps too it may be so to forget those on whom they conferr'd 'em Then indeed I must be forgotten to all intents and purposes I am it must be own'd dead in a natural capacity according to Mr  Bickerstaff  dead in a poetical capacity as a damn'd author and dead in a civil capacity as a useless member of the Commonwealth But reflect dear Sir what melancholy effects may ensue if Dead men are not civil to one another If he who has nothing to do himself will not comfort and support another in his Idleness If those who are to die themselves will not now and then pay the charity of visiting a Tomb and a dead friend and strowing a sew flow'rs over him In the shades where I am the Inhabitants have a mutual compassion for each other Being all alike  Inanes  and  Umbratiles  we saunter to one another's habitations and daily assist each other in doing nothing at all this I mention for your edification and example that  Tout plein du vie  as you are yet you may not sometimes disdain  desipere in loco  Tho' you are no Papist and have not so much regard to the dead as to address yourself to them which I plainly perceive by your silence yet I hope you are not one of those  Heterodox who hold them to be totally insensible of the good offices and kind wishes of their living friends and to be in a dull State of Sleep without one dream of those they left behind them If you are let this Letter convince you to the contrary which assures you I am still tho' in a State of Separation  Your  c  P S  This letter of Deaths puts me in mind of poor Mr  Betterton  's over whom I wou'd have this Sentence of  Tully  for an Epitaph  Vitae bene actae jucundissima est Recordatio  June  'TIS very natural for a young Friend and a young Lover to think the persons they love have nothing to do but to please them when perhaps they for their parts had twenty other engagements before This was my case when I wonder'd I did not hear from you but I no sooner receiv'd your short letter but I forgot your long silence and so many fine things as you said of me cou'd not but have wrought a cure on my own Sickness if it had not been of the nature of that which is deaf to the Voice of the Charmer 'Twas impossible you  cou'd have better tim'd your compliment on my Philosophy it was certainly properest to commend me for it just when I most needed it and when I cou'd least be proud of it that is when I was in pain 'Tis not easy to express what an exaltation it gave to my Spirits above all the cordials of my Doctor and 'tis no compliment to tell you that your Compliments were sweeter than the sweetest of his Juleps and Syrups But if you will not believe so much  Pour le moins votre Compliment  M'a soulage dans ce moment  Et des qu' on me l'est venu faire  J'ay chasse mon Apoticaire  Et renvoye mon Lavement  Nevertheless I wou'd not have you entirely lay aside the thoughts of my Epitaph any more than I do those of the probability of my becoming ere long the subject of one For Death has of late been very familiar with some of my Size I am told my Lord  Lumley  and Mr  Litton  are gone before me and tho' I may now without vanity esteem myself the least thing like a man in  England  yet I can't but be sorry two Heroes of such a make shou'd die inglorious in their beds when it had been a  fate more worthy our size had they met with theirs from an irruption of Cranes or other warlike Animals those antient enemies to our  Pygmaean  Ancestors You of a superior species little regard what befals us  Homunciolos Sesquipedales  however you have no reason to be so unconcern'd since all Physicians agree there is no greater sign of a Plague among Men than a Mortality among Frogs I was the other day in company with a Lady who rally'd my Person so much as to cause a total subversion of my countenance Some days after to be reveng'd on her I presented her among other company the following  Rondeau  on that occasion which I desire you to show  Sapho  You know where you did despise  T'other day my little Eyes  Little Legs and little Thighs  And some things of little Size  You know where  You 'tis true have fine black Eyes  Taper Legs and tempting Thighs  Yet what more than all we prize  Is a thing of little Size  You know where  This sort of writing call'd the  Rondeau  is what I never knew practis'd in our Nation and I verily believe it was not in use with the  Greeks  or  Romans  neither  Macrobius  nor  Hyginus  taking the least notice of it 'Tis to be observ'd that the vulgar spelling and pronouncing it  Round O  is a manifest Corruption and by no means to be allow'd of by Critics Some may mistakenly imagine that it was a sort of  Rondeau  which the  Gallick  Soldiers sung in  Caesar  's Triumph over  GaulGallias Caesar subegit  c as it is recorded by  Suetonius  in  Julio  and so derive its original from the antient  Gauls  to the modern  French  but this is erroneous the words there not being rang'd according to the Laws of the  Rondeau  as laid down by  Clement Marot  If you will say that the Song of the Soldiers might be only the rude beginning of this kind of Poem and so consequently imperfect neither  Heinsius  nor I can be of that opinion and so I conclude that we know nothing of the matter  But Sir I ask your pardon for all this Buffoonry which I could not address to any one so well as to you since I have found by experience you most easily forgive my impertinencies 'Tis only to show you that I am mindful of you at all times that I write at all times and as nothing I can say can be worth your reading so I may as  well throw out what comes uppermost as study to be dull I am  c  Mr  C  to Mr POPE  July  AT last I have prevail'd over a lazy humour to transcribe this Elegy I have chang'd the situation of some of the  Latin  Verses and made some Interpolations but I hope they are not absurd and foreign to my author's sense and manner but they are refer'd to your censure as a debt whom I esteem no less a Critic than a Poet I expect to be treated with the same rigour as I have practis'd to Mr  Dryden  and you  Hanc veniam petimus{que} damus{que} vicessim  I desire the favour of your opinion why  Priam  in his speech to  Pyrrhus  in the second  Aeneid  says this to him  At non ille satum quo te mentiris  Achilles  He wou'd intimate I fancy by  Pyrrhus  's answer only his degeneracy but then these following lines of the Version I suppose  from  Homer  's History seem absurd in the mouth of  Priam  viz  He chear'd my sorrows and for sums of gold  The bloodless carcase of my  Hector  sold  I am Your  c  Mr POPE's Answer  July  I Give you thanks for the Version you sent me of  Ovid  's Elegy It is very much an image of that author's writing who has an agreeableness that charms us without correctness like a mistress whose faults we see but love her with them all You have very judiciously alter'd his method in some places and I can find nothing which I dare insist upon as an error What I have written in the margins being merely Guesses at a little improvement rather than Criticisms I assure you I do not expect you shou'd subscribe to my private notions but when you shall judge 'em agreeable to reason and good sense What I have done is not as a Critic but as a Friend I know too well how many qualities are requisite to make up the one and that I want almost all  I can reckon up but I am sure I do not want inclination nor I hope capacity to be the other Nor shall I take it at all amiss that another dissents from my opinion 'Tis no more than I have often done from my own and indeed the more a man advances in understanding he becomes the more every day a critic upon himself and finds something or other still to blame in his former notions and opinions I cou'd be glad to know if you have translated the th Elegy of  Lib    Ad amican navigantem  the th of Book or the th of Book which are above all others my particular favourites especially the last of these  As to the passage of which you ask my opinion in the second  Aeneid  it is either so plain as to require no solution or else which is very probable you see farther into it than I can  Priam  wou'd say  "that  Achilles  whom surely you only feign to be your Father since your actions are so different from his did not use me thus inhumanly He blush'd at his murder of  Hector  when he saw my sorrows for him and restor'd his dead body to me to be buried"  To this the answer of  Pyrrhus  seems to be agreeable enough  "Go then to the shades and tell  Achilles  how I degenerate from him"  granting the truth of what  Priam  had said of the difference between them  Indeed Mr  Dryden  's mentioning here what  Virgil  more judiciously passes in silence the circumstance of  Achilles  's selling  for mony  the body of  Hector  seems not so proper it in some measure less'ning the character of  Achilles  's generosity and piety which is the very point of which  Priam  endeavours in this place to convince his Son and to reproach him with the want of But the truth of this Circumstance is no way to be question'd being expresly taken from  Homer  who represents  Achilles  weeping for  Priam  yet receiving the gold  Iliad  For when he gives the body he uses these words  "O my friend  Patroclus  forgive me that I quit the corps of him who kill'd thee I have great gifts in ransom for it which I will bestow upon thy funeral"  I am  c  Mr  C  to Mr POPE  Aug  LOoking among some  French  Rhymes I was agreeably surpriz'd to find in the  Rondeau  of  In  Voiture  's Poems  Pour le moins  your  Apoticaire  and  Lavement  which I took for your own so much is your Muse of Intelligence with the Wits of all languages You have refin'd upon  Voiture  whose  Ou Vous Sçavez  is much inferior to your  You know where  You do not only pay your club with your author as our friend says but the whole reckoning who can form such pretty lines from so trivial a hint  For  Ovid  's  Amorum  l  El    Pars me Sulmo  c  my Elegy 'tis confess'd that the Topography of  Sulmo  in the  Latin  makes but an awkward figure in the Version Your couplet of the  Dogstar  is very fine but may be too sublime in this place I laugh'd heartily at your note upon  Paradise  for to make  Ovid  talk of the Garden of  Eden  is certainly most absurd But  Xenophon  in his  Oeconomicks  speaking of a garden finely planted and watered as is here described calls it  Paradisos  'Tis an interpolation indeed and serves for a gradation to the  Caelestial Orb  which expresses in some sort the  Sidus Castoris in parte Caeli  how  Trees can enjoy  let the naturalists determine but the Poets make 'em sensitive lovers bachelors and married  Virgil  in his  Georgicks Lib    Horace Ode    Lib    Platanus caelebs evincet ulmos Epod    Ergo aut adulta vitium propagine Altas maritat populos  Your Critique is a very  Dolcepiccante  for after the many faults you justly find you smooth your rigour but an obliging thing is owing you think to one who so much esteems and admires you and who shall ever be  Your  c  August  YOUR Letters are a perfect charity to a man in retirement utterly forgotten of all his Friends but you for since Mr  Wycherley  left  London  I have not heard a word from him tho' just before and once since I writ to him and tho' I know myself guilty of no offence but of doing sincerely just what he  Correcting his Verses See the Letters in and the following Years of Mr Wycherley and Mr  Pope  bid me  Hoc mihi libertas hoc pia lingua dedit  But the greatest injury he does me is the keeping me in ignorance of his welfare which I am always very sollicitous for and very uneasy in the fear of any Indisposition that may befal him In what I sent you some time ago you have not verse enough to be severe upon in revenge for my last criticism In one point I must persist that is to say my dislike of your  Paradise  in which I take no pleasure I know very well that in  Greek  'tis not only us'd by  Xenophon  but is a common word for any Garden but in  English  it bears the signification and conveys the idea of  Eden  which alone is I think a reason against making  Ovid  use it who will be thought to talk too like a Christian in your version at least whatever it might have been in  Latin  or  Greek  As for all the rest of my Remarks since you do not laugh at them as at this I can be so civil as not to lay any stress upon 'em as I think I told you before and in particular in the point of  Trees enjoying  you have I must own sully satisfy'd me that the Expression is not only defensible but beautiful I shall be very glad to see your Translation of the Elegy  Ad Amicam navigantem  as soon as you can for without a compliment to you every thing you write either in verse or prose is welcome to me and you may be confident if my opinion can be of any sort of consequence in any thing that I will never be unsincere tho' I may be often mistaken To use Sincerity with you is but paying you in your own coin from whom I have experienc'd so much of it and I need not tell you how much I really esteem you when I esteem nothing in the world so much as that Quality I know you sometimes say civil things to me in your Epistolary Style but those I am to make allowance  for as particularly when you talk of  Admiring  'tis a word you are so us'd to in conversation of Ladies that it will creep in to your discourse in spite of you ev'n to your Friends But as Women when they think themselves secure of admiration commit a thousand Negligences which show them so much at disadvantage and off their guard as to lose the little real Love they had before so when men imagine others entertain some esteem for their abilities they often expose all their Imperfections and foolish works to the disparagement of the little Wit they were thought masters of I am going to exemplify this to you in putting into your hands being encourag'd by so much indulgence some verses of my Youth or rather Childhood which as I was a great admirer of  Waller  were intended in imitation of his manner and are perhaps such imitations as those you see in awkward country Dames of the fine and wellbred Ladies of the Court If you will take 'em with you into  Lincolnshire  they may save you one hour from the conversation of the country Gentlemen and their Tenants who differ but in Dress and Name which if it be there as bad as here is even worse than my Poetry I hope your stay there will be no longer than as Mr  Wycherley  calls it to rob the  Country and run away to  London  with your money In the mean time I beg the favour of a line from you and am as I will never cease to be  Your  c  October  I Deferr'd answering your last upon the advice I receiv'd that you were leaving the town for some time and expected your return with impatience having then a design of seeing my Friends there among the first of which I have reason to account yourself But my almost continual Illnesses prevent that as well as most other satisfactions of my life However I may say one good thing of sickness that it is the best Cure in nature for Ambition and designs upon the World or Fortune It makes a man pretty indifferent for the future provided he can but be easy by intervals for the present He will be content to compound for his Quiet only and leave all the circumstantial part and pomp of life to those who have a health vigorous enough to enjoy all the Mistresses of their desires I thank God there is nothing out of myself which I would be at  the trouble of seeking except a Friend a happiness I once hop'd to have possess'd in Mr  Wycherley  but  Quantum mutalus ab illo  I have for some years been employ'd much like Children that build houses with Cards endeavouring very busily and eagerly to raise a Friendship which the first breath of any illnatur'd Bystander cou'd puff awayBut I will trouble you no farther with writing nor myself with thinking of this subject  I was mightily pleas'd to perceive by your quotation from  Voiture  that you had track'd me so far as  France  You see 'tis with weak heads as with weak stomachs they immediately throw out what they receiv'd last and what they read floats upon the surface of their mind like Oil upon water without incorporating This I think however can't be said of the Loveverses I last troubled you with where all I am afraid is so puerile and so like the Author that no body will suspect any thing to be borrow'd Yet you as a friend entertaining a better opinion of 'em it seems search'd in  Waller  but search'd in vain Your judgment of 'em is I think very rightfor it was my own opinion before If you think 'em not worth the trouble of correcting  pray tell me so freely and it will save me a labour if you think the contrary you wou'd particularly oblige me by your remarks on the several thoughts as they occur I long to be nibling at your verses and have not forgot who promis'd me  Ovid  's Elegy  ad Amicam Navigantem  Had  Ovid  been as long composing it as you in sending it the Lady might have sail'd to  Gades  and receiv'd it at her return I have really a great Itch of Criticism upon me but want matter here in the Country which I desire you to furnish me with as I do you in the Town  Sic servat sludii Faedera quisque sui  I am oblig'd to Mr  Caryl  whom you tell me you met at  Epsom  for telling you Truth as a man is in these days to any one that will tell Truth to his advantage and I think none is more to mine than what he told you and I shou'd be glad to tell all the world that I have an extreme Affection and estrem for you  Tecum etenim longos memini consumere soles  Et tecum primas epulis decerpere noctes  Unum Opus Requiem pariter disponimus ambo  Atque verecunda laxamus seria mensa  By these  Epulae  as I take it  Persius  meant the  Portugal Snuff  and  burn'd Claret which  he took with his master  Cornutus  and the  Verecunda Mensa  was without dispute some Coffeehouse table of the antientsI will only observe that these four lines are as elegant and musical as any in  Persius  not excepting those six or seven which Mr  Dryden  quotes as the only such in all that AuthorI could be heartily glad to repeat the satisfaction describ'd in them being truly  Your  c  October  I am glad to find by your last letter that you write to me with the freedom of a friend setting down your thoughts as they occur and dealing plainly with me in the matter of my own Trifles which I assure you I never valu'd half so much as I do that Sincerity in you which they were the occasion of discovering to me and which while I am happy in I may be trusted with that dangerous weapon Poetry since I shall do  nothing with it but after asking and following your advice I value Sincerity the more as I find by sad experience the practice of it is more dangerous Writers rarely pardoning the executioners of their Verses ev'n tho' themselves pronounce sentence upon themAs to Mr  Philips  's Pastorals I take the first to be infinitely the best and the second the worst the third is for the greatest part a Translation from  Virgil  's  Daphnis  I will not forestal your judgment of the rest only observe in that of the Nightingale these lines speaking of the Musician's playing on the harp  Now lightly skimming o'er the Strings they pass  Like Winds that gently brush the plying grass  And melting Airs arise at their command  And now laborious with a weighty hand  He sinks into the Cords with solemn pace  And gives the swelling Tones a manly grace  To which nothing can be objected but that they are too lofty for Pastoral especially being put into the mouth of a Shepherd as they are here in the Poet's own person they had been I believe more proper These are more after  Virgil  's manner than that of  Theocritus  whom yet in the character of Pastoral he rather seems to  imitate In the whole I agree with the  Tatler  that we have no better Eclogues in our language There is a small copy of the same Author publish'd in the  Tatler  N  o  on the  Danish  Winter 'Tis Poetical Painting and I recommend it to your perusal  Dr  Garth  's Poem I have not seen but believe I shall be of that Critic's opinion you mention at  Will  's who swore it was good For tho' I am very cautious of swearing after Critics yet I think one may do it more safely when they commend than when they blame  I agree with you in your censure of the use of  Seaterms  in Mr  Dryden  's  Virgil  not only because  Helenus  was no great Prophet in those matters but because no Terms of Art or CantWords suit with the Majesty and dignity of Style which  Epic  Poetry requires  Cui mens divinior atque os magna soniturum  The Tarpawlin Phrase can please none but such  Qui aurem habent Batavam  they must not expect  Auribus Atticis probari  I find by you I think I have brought in two phrases of  Martial  here very dexterously  Tho' you say you did not rightly take my Meaning in the verse I quoted from  Juvenal  yet I will not explain it because tho' it seems you are resolv'd to take me for a  Critic I wou'd by no means be thought a CommentatorAnd for another reason too because I have quite forgot both the Verse and the Application  I hope it will be no offence to give my most hearty service to Mr  Wycherley  tho' I perceive by his last to me I am not to trouble him with my letters since he there told me he was going instantly out of Town and till his return was my Servant  c  I guess by yours he is yet with you and beg you to do what you may with all truth and honour that is assure him I have ever borne all the Respect and Kindness imaginable to him I do not know to this hour what it is that has estrang'd him from me but this I know that he may for the future be more safely my friend since no invitation of his shall ever more make me so free with him I cou'd not have thought any man had been so very cautious and suspicious as not to credit his own Experience of a friend Indeed to believe no body may be a Maxim of Safety but not so much of Honesty There is but one way I know of conversing safely with all men that is not by concealing what we say or do but by saying or doing nothing that deserves to be conceal'd and I can truly boast this comfort in my affairs with Mr  Wycherley  But I pardon  his Jealousy which is become his Nature and shall never be his enemy whatsoever he says of me  Your  c  Mr  C  to Mr POPE  Nov  I Find I am oblig'd to the sight of your Loveverses for your opinion of my sincerity which had never been call'd in question if you had not forc'd me upon so many other occasions to express my esteem  I have just read and compar'd  Pieces printed in the th Vol of  Tonson  's Miscellanies  Mr  Row  's Version of the th of  Lucan  with very great pleasure where I find none of those absurdities so frequent in that of  Virgil  except in two places for the sake of lashing the Priests one where  Cato  says  Sortilegis egeant dubii  and one in the simile of the  Haemorhoisfatidici Sabaei  He is so errant a Whig that he strains even beyond his Author in passion for Liberty and  aversion to Tyranny and errs only in amplification  Lucan  in  initio    ni  describing the seat of the  Semidei manes  says  Quod{que} patet terras inter Lunae{que} meatus  Semidei manes habitant  Mr  Row  has this Line  Then looking down on the Sun's feeble Ray  Pray your opinion if there be an  ErrorSphaericus  in this or no  Yours  c  Nov  YOU mistake me very much in thinking the freedom you kindly us'd with my Loveverses gave me the first opinion of your sincerity I assure you it only did what every goodnatur'd action of yours has done since confirm'd me more in that opinion The Fable of the Nightingale in  Philips  's Pastoral is taken from  Famianus Strada  's  Latin  Poem on the same subject in his  Prolusiones Academicae  only the Tomb he erects at the end is added from  Virgil  's conclusion of the  Culex  I can't forbear giving you a passage out of the  Latin  Poem  I mention by which you will find the  English  Poet is indebted to it  Alternat mira arte sides dum torquet acutas  Incidit{que} graves operoso verbere pulsat  Jam{que} manu per fila volat simul hos simul illos  Explorat numeros chorda{que} laborat in omni  Mox silet Illa modis totidem respondit artem  Arte refert nunc ceu rudis aut incerta canendi  Praebet iter liquidum labenti è pectore voci  Nunc caesim variat modulisque canora minutis  Delibrat vocem tremuloque reciprocat ore  This Poem was many years since imitated by  Crashaw  out of whose Verses the following are very remarkable  From this to that from that to this he flies  Feels Musick's Pulse in all its Arteries  Caught in a net which there  Apollo  spreads  His fingers struggle with the vocal threads  I have as I think I formerly told you a very good opinion of Mr  Row  's th book  of  Lucan  Indeed he amplifies too much as well as  Brebaeus  the famous  French  imitator If I remember right he sometimes takes the whole Comment into the Text of the Version as particularly in lin  Ut{que} solet pariter totis se essundere signis Corycii pressura croci  And in the place you quote he makes of those two lines in the  Latin  Vidit quanta sub nocte jaceret  Nostra dies risitque sui ludibria trunci  no less than eight in  English  What you observe sure cannot be an  Error Sphaericus  strictly speaking either according to their  Ptolomaick  or our  Copernican  System  Tycho Brahe  himself will be on the Translator's side For Mr  Row  here says no more than that he look'd down on the Rays of the Sun which  Pompey  might do even tho' the Body of the Sun were above him  You can't but have remark'd what a journey  Lucan  here makes  Cato  take for the sake of his fine Descriptions From  Cyrene  he travels by land for no better reason than this  Haec eadem sua debat Hyems quae clauserat aequor  The Winter's effects on the Sea it seems were more to be dreaded than all the Serpents Whirlwinds Sands  c  by Land which immediately after he paints out in his speech to the soldiers Then he fetches a compass a vast way round about to the  Nasamones  and  Jupiter Ammon  's Temple purely to ridicule the Oracles And  Labienus  must pardon me if I do not believe him when he says  sors obtulit fortuna viae  either  Labienus  or the Map is very much mistaken here Thence he returns back to the  Syrtes  which he might have taken first in his way to  Utica  and so to  Leptis Minor  where our Author leaves him who seems to have made  Cato  speak his own mind when he tells his Army  Ire sat est  no matter whither I am  Your  c  Mr  C  to Mr POPE  Nov  THE System of  Tycho Brahe  were it true as it is  Novel  cou'd have no room here  Lucan  with the rest of the  Latin  Poets seems to follow  Plato  whose  order of the Spheres is clear in  Cicero De Natura Deorum De somnio Scipionis  and in  Macrobius  The Seat of the  Semidei manes  is  Platonick  too for  Apuleius de Deo Socratis  assigns the same to the  Genii viz  the Region of the  Air  for their intercourse with Gods and Men so that I fancy  Row  mistook the situation and I can't be reconcil'd to  Look down on the Sun's Rays  I am glad you agree with me about the latitude he takes and wish you had told me if the  sortilegi  and  fatidici  cou'd licence his invectives against Priests But I suppose you think them with  Helena  undeserving of your protection I agree with you in  Lucan  's Errors and the cause of 'em his Poetic descriptions for the  Romans  then knew the coast of  Africa  from  Cyrene  to the Southeast of which lies  Ammon  toward  Egypt  to  Leptis  and  Utica  But pray remember how your  Homer  nodded while  Ulysses  slept and waking knew not where he was in the short passage from  Corcyra  to  Ithaca  I like  Trapp  's Versions for their justness his Psalm is excellent the Prodigies in the first  Georgick  judicious whence I conclude that 'tis easier to turn  Virgil  justly in blank verse than rhyme The Eclogue of  Gallus  and Fable of  Phaeton  pretty well but he is very saulty in his  Numbers  the fate of  Phaeton  might run thus  The blasted  Phaeton  with blazing Hair  Shot gliding thro' the vast Abyss of Air  And tumbled headlong like a falling Star  I am Your  c  Mr POPE's Answer  Nov  TO make use of that freedom and familiarity of style which we have taken up in our Correspondence and which is more properly Talking upon paper than Writing I will tell you without any preface that I never took  Tycho Brahe  for one of the Antients or in the least an acquaintance of  Lucan  's nay 'tis a mercy on this occasion tha  I do not give you an account of h  Life and conversation as how he liv  some years like an inchanted Knight in a certain Island with a tale of a King of  Denmark  's Mistress that shall be namelessBut I have compassion on you and wou'd not for the world you shou'd  stay any longer among the  Genii  and  Semidei Manes  you know where for if once you get so near the Moon  Sapho  will want your presence in the Clouds and inferior regions not to mention the great loss  Drurylane  will sustain when Mr  C  is in the Milky way These coelestial thoughts put me in mind of the  Priests  you mention who are a sort of  Sortilegi  in one sense because in their Lottery there are more Blanks than Prizes the Adventurers being at best in an uncertainty whereas the Settersup are sure of something Priests indeed in their Character as they represent God are sacred and so are Constables as they represent the King but you will own a great many of 'em are very odd fellows and the devil a bit of likeness in 'em Yet I can assure you I honour the good as much as I detest the bad and I think that in condemning these we praise those I am so far from esteeming e'en the worst unworthy of my protection that I have defended their Character in  Congreve  's and  Vanbrugh  's Plays ev'n against their own Brethren And so much for Priests in general now for  Trapp  in particular whose Translations from  Ovid  I have not so good an opinion of as you not I will assure you from any sort of prejudice to him as a Priest but because I  think he has little of the main Characteristick of his Author a graceful Easiness For let the sense be ever so exactly render'd unless an author looks like himself in his air habit manner 'tis a Disguise and not a Translation But as to the Psalm I think  David  is much more beholden to him than  Ovid  and as he treated the  Roman  like a  Jew  so he has made the  Jew  speak like a  Roman  Your  c  Mr  C  to Mr POPE  Decemb  THE same judgment we made on  Row  's th of  Lucan  will serve for his part of the th where I find this memorable line  Par{que} novum Fortuna videt concurrere bellum  At{que} virum  For this he employs six Verses among which is this  As if on Knightly terms in Lists they ran  Pray can you trace Chivalry up higher than  Pharamond  will you allow it an Anachronism    Tickell  in his Version of the Phoenix from  Claudian  When Nature ceases thou shalt still remain  Nor second Chaos bound thy endless reign  Claudian  thus  Et clades te nulla rapit solus{que} supersles  Edom ta Tellure manes  which plainly resers to the Deluge of  Deucalion  and the Conflagration of  Phaeton  not to the final Dissolution You thought of the  Priests Lottery  is very fine you play the Wit and not the Critic upon the errors of your brother  Your observations are all very just  Virgil  is eminent for adjusting his diction to his sentiments and among the moderns I find your Practice the Prosodia of your Rules Your  To a Lady with the Works of  Voiture  Poem shews you to be what you say of  Voiture with Books wellbred  The state of the Fair tho' satirical is touch'd with that delicacy and gallantry that not the Court of  Augustus  norBut hold I shall lose what I lately recover'd your opinion of my Sincerity yet I must say 'tis as faultless as the Fair to whom 'tis address'd be she never so perfect  The M G who it seems had no right notion of you as you of him transcrib'd it by lucubration From some discourse of yours he thought your inclination led you to what the men of fashion call Learning Pedantry but now he says he has no less I assure you than a Veneration for you  Your  c  Mr POPE to Mr C  Decemb  IT seems that my late mention of  Crashaw  and my quotation from him has mov'd your curiosity I therefore send you the whole Author who has held a place among my other books of this nature for some years in which time having read him twice or thrice I find him one of those whose works may just deserve reading I take this Poet to have writ like a Gentleman that is at leisure hours and more to keep out of idleness than to establish a reputation so that nothing regular or just can be expected from him All that regards Design Form Fable which is the Soul of Poetry all that concerns exactness or consent of parts which is the  Body will probably be wanting only pretty conceptions fine metaphors glitt'ring expressions and something of a neat cast of Verse which are properly the dress gems or loose ornaments of Poetry may be found in these verses This is indeed the case of most other Poetical Writers of  Miscellanies  nor can it well be otherwise since no man can be a true Poet who writes for diversion only These Authors shou'd be consider'd as  Versifiers  and  witty Men  rather than as  Poets  and under this head will only fall the Thoughts the Expression and the Numbers These are only the pleasing parts of Poetry which may be judg'd of at a view and comprehended all at once And to express myself like a Painter their  Colouring  entertains the sight but the  Lines  and  Life  of the Picture are not to be inspected too narrowly  This Author form'd himself upon  Petrarch  or rather upon  Marino  His thoughts one may observe in the main are pretty but oftentimes far fetch'd and too often strain'd and stiffned to make them appear the greater For men are never so apt to think a thing great as when it is odd or wonderful and inconsiderate Authors wou'd rather be admir'd than understood This ambition of surprising a reader is the true natural cause of all Fustian or Bombast in  Poetry To confirm what I have said you need but look into his first Poem of the  Weeper  where the d th th th st stanza's are as sublimely dull as the th th th th th th and d stanza's of the same copy are soft and pleasing And if these last want any thing it is an easier and more unaffected expression The remaining thoughts in that Poem might have been spared being eihter but repetitions or very trivial and mean And by this example in the first one may guess at all the rest to be like this a mixture of tender gentle thoughts and sutiable expressions of sorc'd and inextricable conceits and of needless fillersup to the rest From all which it is plain this Author writ fast and set down what came uppermost A reader may skim off the froth and use the clear underneath but if he goes too deep will meet with a mouthful of dregs either the Top or bottom of him are good for little but what he did in his  own natural middleway  is best  To speak of his  Numbers  is a little difficult they are so various and irregular and mostly Pindarick 'tis evident his heroic Verse the best example of which is his  Musick  's  Duel  is carelesly made up but one may imagine from what it now is  that had he taken more care it had been musical and pleasing enough not extremely majestic but sweet And the time consider'd of his writing he was ev'n as uncorrect as he is none of the worst Versificators  I will just observe that the best Pieces of this Author are a Paraphrase on Psal On  Lessius  Epitaph on Mr  Ashton  Wishes to his suppos'd Mistress and the  Dies Irae  I am  c  Mr POPE to Mr C  Decemb  I Resume my old liberty of throwing out myself upon paper to you and making what thoughts float uppermost in my head the subject of a letter They are at present upon  Laughter  which for ought I know may be the cause you might sometimes think me too remiss a friend when I was most intirely so for I am never so inclin'd to mirth as when I am most pleas'd and most easy which is in the company of a friend like yourself  As the fooling and toying with a mistress is a proof of fondness not disrespect so is raillery with a friend I know there are Prudes in friendship who expect distance awe and adoration but I know you are not of them and I for my part am no Idolworshipper tho' a Papist If I were to address  Jupiter  himself in a heathen way I fancy I shou'd be apt to take hold of his knee in a familiar manner if not of his beard like  Dionysius  I was just going to say of his buttons but I think  Jupiter  wore none however I won't be positive to so nice a Critic as you but his robe might be  Subnected  with a  Fibula  I know some Philosophers define Laughter  A recommending ourselves to our own favour by comparison with the weakness of another  but I am sure I very rarely laugh with that view nor do I believe  Children  have any such consideration in their heads when they express their pleasure this way I laugh full as innocently as they for the most part and as sillily There is a difference too betwixt laughing  about  a thing and laughing  at  a thing One may find the inferior Man to make a kind of casuistical distinction provok'd to folly at the sight or observation of some  circumstance of a thing  when the  thing itself  appears solemn and august to the superior Man that is our  Judgment and Reason Let an Ambassador speak the best Sense in the world and deport himself in the most graceful manner before a Prince yet if the  Tail  of  his Shirt  happen as I have known it happen to a very wise man to hang out behind more people shall laugh at that than attend to the other till they recollect themselves and then they will not have a jot the less respect for the Minister I must confess the iniquity of my countenance before you several Muscles of my Face sometimes take an impertinent liberty with my Judgment but then my Judgment soon rises and sets all right again about my mouth And I find I value no man so much as he in whose sight I have been playing the fool I cannot be  SubPersona  before a man I love and not to laugh with honesty when Nature prompts or Folly which is more a second Nature than any thing I know is but a knavish hypocritical way of making a mask of one's own FaceTo conclude those that are my friends I  laugh with  and those that are not I  laugh at  so am merry in company and if ever I am wise it is all by myself You take just another course and to those that are not your friends are very civil and to those that are very endearing and complaisant Thus when you and I meet there will be  the  Risus Blanditiae  united together in conversation as they commonly are in a verse But without Laughter on the one side or Compliment on the other I assure you I am with real esteem  Yours  c  Mr C to Mr POPE  October  MR  Wycherley  visited me at the  Bath  in my sickness and express'd much affection to me hearing from me how welcome his Letters would be he presently writ to you in which I inserted my Scrall and after a second He went to  Gloucester  in his way to  Salop  but was disappointed of a boat and so return'd to the  Bath  then he shew'd me your answer to his letters in which you speak of my good nature but I fear you found me very froward at  Reading  yet you allow for my illness I cou'd not possibly be in the same house with Mr  Wycherley  tho' I sought it earnestly nor come up to town with him he being engag'd with others but whenever we met we  talk'd of you He praises your  Essay on Criticism  Poem and even outvies me in kind expressions of you As if he had not wrote two letters to you he was for writing every Post I put him in mind he had already Forgive me this wrong I know not whither my talking so much of your great humanity and tenderness to me and love to him or whether the return of his natural disposition to you was the cause but certainly you are now highly in his favour now he will come this Winter to your house and I must go with him but first he will invite you speedily to townI arriv'd on  Saturday  last much wearied yet had wrote sooner but was told by Mr  Gay  who has writ a pretty Poem to  Lintot  and who gives you his service that you was gone from home  Lewis  shew'd me your letter which set me right and your next letter is impatiently expected by me Mr  Wycherley  came to town on  Sunday  last and kindly surpriz'd me with a visit on  Monday  morning We din'd and drank together and I saying  To our Loves  he reply'd  'Tis Mr  Pope  's health  He said he would go to Mr  Thorold  's and leave a letter for you Tho' I cannot answer for the event of all this in  respect to him yet I can assure you that when you please to come you will be most desirable to me as always by inclination so now by duty who shall ever be  Your  c  Mr POPE to Mr  C  Nov  I Receiv'd the entertainment of your Letter the day after I had sent you one of mine and I am but this morning return'd hither The news you tell me of the many difficulties you found in your return from  Bath  gives me such a kind of pleasure as we usually take in accompanying our Friends in their mixt adventures for methinks I see you labouring thro' all your inconveniencies of the rough roads the hard saddle the trotting horse and what not What an agreeable surprize wou'd it have been to me to have met you by pure accident which I was within an ace of doing and to have carry'd you off triumphantly set you on an easier Pad and reliev'd the wandring Knight with a Night's lodging and rural Repast at our Castle in the Forest But these are only  the pleasing Imaginations of a disappointed Lover who must suffer in a melancholy absence yet these two months In the mean time I take up with the Muses for want of your better company the Muses  Quae nobiscum pernoctant peregrinantur rusticantur  Those aerial Ladies just discover enough to me of their beauties to urge my pursuit and draw me on in a wand'ring Maze of thought still in hopes and only in hopes of attaining those favours from 'em which they confer on their more happy Admirers We grasp some more beautiful Idea in our own brain than our endeavours to express it can set to the view of others and still do but labour to fall short of our first Imagination The gay Colouring which Fancy gave at the first transient glance we had of it goes off in the Execution like those various figures in the gilded clouds which while we gaze long upon to separate the parts of each imaginary Image the whole faints before the eye and decays into confusion  I am highly pleas'd with the knowledge you give me of Mr  Wycherley  's present temper which seems so favourable to me I shall ever have such a Fund of Affection for him as to be agreeable to myself when I am so to him and cannot but be  gay when he's in good humour as the surface of the Earth if you will pardon a poetical similitude is clearer or gloomier just as the Sun is brighter or more overcastI should be glad to see the Verses to  Lintot  which you mention for methinks something oddly agreeable may be produc'd from that subjectFor what remains I am so well that nothing but the assurance of your being so can make me better and if you wou'd have me live with any satisfaction these dark days in which I cannot see you it must be by your writing sometimes to  Your  c  Mr  C  to Mr POPE  Dec  MR  Wycherley  has I believe sent you two or three letters of invitation but you like the Fair will be long sollicited before you yield to make the favour the more acceptable to the Lover He is much yours by his talk for that unbounded Genius which has rang'd at large like a libertine now seems confin'd to you  and I shou'd take him for your Mistress too by your simile of the Sun and Earth 'Tis very fine but inverted by the application for the gaiety of your fancy and the drooping of his by the withdrawing of your lustre perswades me it wou'd be juster by the reverse Oh happy Favourite of the Muses how  pernoctare  all night long with them but alas you do but toy but skirmish with them and decline a close Engagement Leave Elegy and Translation to the inferior Class on whom the Muses only glance now and then like our WinterSun and then leave 'em in the dark Think on the Dignity of Tragedy which is of the greater Poetry as  Dennis  says and foil him at his other weapon as you have done in Criticism Every one wonders that a Genius like yours will not support the sinking  Drama  and Mr  Wilks  tho' I think his Talent is Comedy has express'd a furious ambition to swell in your Buskins We have had a poor Comedy of  Johnson  's not  Ben  which held seven nights and has got him three hundred pounds for the Town is sharpset on new Plays In vain wou'd I fire you by Interest or Ambition when your mind is not susceptible of either tho' your Authority arising from the General esteem like that of  Pompey  must infallibly assure you of success for  which in all your wishes you will be attended with those of  Yours  c  Mr POPE to Mr  C  Decemb  IF I have not writ to you so soon as I ought let my writing now attone for the delay as it will infallibly do when you know what a Sacrifice I make you at this time and that every moment my eyes are employ'd upon this paper they are taken off from two of the finest Faces in the universe But indeed 'tis some consolation to me to reflect that while I but write this period I escape some hundred fatal Darts from those unerring Eyes and about a thousand Deaths or better Now you that delight in dying wou'd not once have dreamt of an absent Friend in these circumstances you that are so nice an Admirer of Beauty or as a Critic wou'd say after  Terence    so elegant a Spectator of Forms  You must have a sober dish of Coffee and a solitary candle at your side to write an Epistle Lucubratory to your friend whereas I can do it as well with two pair of radiant lights that outshine the golden God  of Day and silver Goddess of Night with all the refulgent Eyes of the FirmamentYou fancy now that  Sapho  's eyes are two of these my Tapers but it is no such matter Sir these are eyes that have more perswasion in one glance than all  Sapho  's Oratory and Gesture together let her put her body into what moving postures she pleases Indeed indeed my friend you cou'd never have found so improper a time to tempt me with Interest or Ambition let me but have the Reputation of these in my keeping and as for my own let the Devil or let  Dennis  take it for ever How gladly wou'd I give all I am worth that is to say my  Pastorals  for one of them and my  Essay  for the other I wou'd lay out all my  Poetry  in  Love  an  Original  for a  Lady  and a  Translation  for a  waiting Maid  alas what have I to do with  Jane Grey  as long as Miss  Molly  Miss  Betty  or Miss  Patty  are in this world Shall I write of  Beauties murder'd long ago  when there are those at this instant that  murder me  I'll e'en compose my own Tragedy and the Poet shall appear in his own person to move Compassion 'Twill be far more effectual than  Bays  's entring with a rope about his neck and the world will own there never was a more miserable Object brought upon the Stage  Now you that are a Critic pray inform me in what manner I may connect the foregoing part of this Letter with that which is to follow according to the Rules I would willingly return Mr  Gay  my thanks for the favour of his Poem and in particular for his kind mention of me I hop'd when I heard a new Comedy had met with success upon the Stage that it had been his to which I really wish no less and had it been any way in my power should have been very glad to have contributed to it's Introduction into the world His  A Receipt to make a Miscellany  Verses to  Lintot  have put a whim into my head which you are like to be troubled with in the opposite page  This Copy of Verses will be found in our second Volume  Take it as you find it the production of half an hour t'other morning I design very soon to put a task of a more serious nature upon you in reviewing a piece of mine that may better deserve Criticism and by that time you have done with it I hope to tell you in person with how much fidelity I am  Your  c  A POPE  The End of the First Volume
