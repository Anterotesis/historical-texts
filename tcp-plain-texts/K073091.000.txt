 AN ESSAY ON REDEMPTION BY  JESUS CHRIST  Shewing from Scripture the CHARACTER of our RE∣DEEMER the NATURE of his REDEMPTION and the BENEFITS arising from it to MEN  By J MURRAY Of NEWCASTLE  NEWCASTLE  Printed by T SLACK and sold by the Booksellers in Town and Country  INTRODUCTION  A Great part of the  mistakes  about Religion have arisen from men's passing  too suddenly  from one object to another Mankind naturally are dis∣posed to proceed rapidly in their progress after truth and seldom come to the true knowledge of it by reason of not considering  one thing before another  The words of  Job  may be fitly applied to mankind in general  For vain man would be wise though man is born like a wild asses colt  Job  xi  Notwithstanding we are  dull  in our capacities in learning the knowledge of  truth  yet we are  ever  ready to make too  much  haste and to stretch ourselves beyond our measurePassing too quickly from  one  thing to  another  we leave the former before we investigate  its  properties  In seeking to become wise we become fools  by stopping short in our enquiries be∣fore we understand  any  subject Wisdom is not attained by the ordinary methods of seeking after herWe should "search for her as for hid treasure" We ought not to leave  any  truth before we have examined  it  on  all sides  and enquired into its various properties on purpose to understand the  whole complex  or  particular notions  included in  its  general characterHow far  it  may be possible to know the several simple properties which are understood in  general terms  or  universal propositions  IT is necessary if we would understand things as they are in their several constitutions  physical moral  and  oeco∣nomical  to examine the constitutions in which they are considered as  parts  of a  whole  By this means we shall be led to consider the various relations which constitution∣al ideas have to one anotherWhich may be of  singular service  to us in the chusing terms to express either general or particular things By this means we shall proceed  gradually  from  one  property of  any  subject to another and be able to distinguish between  primary  and  secondary truths  and their qualitiesAnd know what we are already in the possession of and what we ought to enquire after on purpose to  consummate our knowledge  IT is a great part of our present infelicity that we think we have knowledge when we have  some perceptions  whereas perceptions are but the materials of knowledge or the steps by which we advance to understanding It is necessary that we judge our perceptions and compare them with  those objects  which we think we perceive other∣wise what we call knowledge will be no more than a  chaos  of  ill arranged perceptions huddled together without any order  ONE  chief  thing to be observed in all our pursuits after truth is  Analysis  The Almighty has seen meet to repre∣sent  Truth  to men  as it were in bundles  and when they are well directed in their enquiries after  it  they proceed by  Analysis  to find out the several simples contained in  every concert  But I must observe  here  that we know  nothing  of absolute simplicity Things to us are only simple by being compared with other things that are more complex but we cannot say that we know  any  thing abstractly in a perfect sense Our notions of simplicity are  entirely  form∣ed from our notions of compositionand we call things simple that are  farthest  from some known compound E∣very object meets us at  first  in a compounded or constitu∣tional stateand our knowledge of constitutional truth consists in our being acquainted with the  Analysis  of its constitution The several individual truths arranged in  such  a constitution when considered distinct from the rest are called  simple  This I take to be  all  that is implied in our ideas of simplicity Our notions of simplicity are therefore  only  relative  I shall observe before I proceed that all our knowledge of the Divine Nature and Operations is founded upon a constitution of his government and we attain to  that  knowledge by being  gradually  let into the  Analysis  of that constitution By unfolding the  various  parts and  relations principles  and  ends  of that constitution the Deity makes  his ways  known to menand the whole system of physi∣cal and moral truth as it relates to  this  constitution comes to be known by comparing those parts and rela∣tions The understanding of parts and their relations in  natural philosophy may be called physical knowledge the understanding of relations and ends in morals may be called  moral knowledge  The term relation is truly no more than the condition of some object with regard to another in some system either as to connection or oppo∣sition Relations are all the parts we possibly can con∣ceive of in a moral system and in  any  moral constitution bear the same respect to one another that parts  properly so called  do in  physics  or  natural philosophy  GOOD and evil are to one another as  heavy  and  light  namely oppositesthey are equally parts of the system they belong to The term  part  is relative and has a respect to a whole as the term  good  is relative and has a relation to  evil  They are only so systematically as far as we know what they are in themselves we cannot cer∣tainly say Moral evil supposeth  some law  and constitu∣tion of government  For where there is no law there is no transgression  It can therefore be evil  only  systematically and cannot be conceived of  out of a system  The true knowledge of the constitution and system we be∣long to with all the various relations and dispensations thereof are taught us in  revelation  the right knowledge of the scriptures is the true  Analysis  of the divine govern∣ment and administration  Which are profitable for all things to make the man of God perfect and to furnish him thoroughly for every good word and work    Tim  iii  THE plan of the divine government hath  never  varied though the external administration thereof hath been va∣rious at different times since the beginning of the world It argues the infinite capacity of the great author that he hath supported an uniform plan of government amidst the  various  dispensations thereof among so many different nations and people  THE first account we have of the conduct of the Al∣mighty towards man is that he made him after  his own image  and placed  him  under a  law  which  law  he qua∣lified  him  to obey by endowing  him  with powers suitable to the  task  he enjoined  him  The rest of the creatures  were made subject to man as the  Representative  of his  Maker  in this lower world  Adam  the first of our pro∣genitors was intrusted with the administration of govern∣ment in this world and was the  vicegerent  of  his Maker  over all the creatures yet he himself was put under a  law  and made  accountable  to the great Legislator of the universe He was God's chief minister under this first constitution  GOD who is possessed of infinite prescience could not but know what would be the issue of  Adam  's administration had therefore provided against  all future contingencies  yet saw meet to suffer a specimen to be handed down through all ages what the most perfect beings were liable to when left entirely to the exercise of their own liberty By permitting  Adam  to betray  his trust  and suffering him to transgress that law he was placed under  He  has evidently shewn that the most perfect human liberty yea angelic freedom cannot secure creatures in happiness without the divine care and agency to uphold them All human powers are created and need as much the concurrence of the power of God to support them in their exercises as it was necessary for their first existence For it is true in a moral as well as a natural sense  That in him we live and move and have our being  Acts  xvii  ADAM being the subject of his Maker and his prime minister with respect to the creatures by breaking that  positive law  concerning the  fruit  of the forbidden  tree  lost his dominion over the creatures and became liable himself to suffer punishment because the law of that con∣stitution threatened death in case of disobedience It is manifest from scripture that the first man being in a  public  character transmitted  his guilt  to  his posterity  for the Apostle plainly declares  That the judgment was by one to condemnation  and  that death reigned by one man's offence  That  by the offence of one judg∣ment came upon all men to condemnation  That  by one man's disobedience many were made sinners  Rom  v  It is plain from the Apostle's o∣pinion of the first transgression that it brought both  death  and  condemnation  along with it How this was consistent  with  that  constitution man  at first  was placed in and how it was just in the Almighty to impute the sin of  Adam  to his posterity may  next  fall under our consideration  HERE we must confine our views of  justice  to what was expressed in the law of the first constitution of man According to that law it was just for God to punish man with death and condemnation because his offence was  treason  against the divine government by affecting  inde∣pendency  The offence was aggravated by man attempting to be  like to God  or rather  independent  upon Him It was not  merely  a  simple  breach of  trust  but an attempt to usurp the throne of the Almighty it was  more  than diso∣bedience of the law that the Almighty gave to  Adam  eating of that fruit  at any rate  might have deserved con∣demnation but to eat thereof to be as God was seeking to become Deities As man had now taken part with beings who had already renounced the  Divine supremacy  as far as they could it was but fit he should share in  their  punishment as far as the offence was  similar  WHENEVER  Adam  should have children they could not but stand in a relation to him as  a parent under for∣feiture  of happiness till such time as it should appear whether they would approve of their father's misconduct or notFor the  spirit  of  all laws  saith that the sons of  traitors  shall not have the inheritance their fathers have forfeited till once the government hath  some proof  of their fidelity The imputation of the guilt of fathers to their children is implied in the  spirit of all laws  and interwoven with  all forms  of wise government But in case sons shall disapprove of their fathers conduct and approve them∣selves worthy of the notice of the  Sovereign  it is  but rea∣sonable  that they be taken under his protection and have the forfeiture removed which their parent brought upon their inheritanceBut this is far from being the case with the seed of  Adam  They became partakers of the  same  rebellious temper of mind that was in him and discover it as soon as they are able to do any thing  NOT to carry this point too far it was and is  just  in our Great Sovereign to impute the guilt of  Adam  's sin to  all his posterity till  they  disapprove of his deed and testify their dislike of it by conformity to that law which he transgressed But shall none of  his race  disapprove of  his conduct  but walk in  his very footsteps  what does the spirit of all good laws say but that the children shall suffer even for the sin of their fathers and their own also I hear∣tily agree with what the Prophet says  If a father beget a son that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done and considereth and doth not such like If he walk in the statutes of life without committing iniquity he shall surely live he shall not die He shall not bear the iniquity of his father  Ezek  xviii and xxxiii  But where do we find among all the sons of  Adam  such wise and considerate children Do not they  all go astray as soon as they are born and are estranged from the very womb  The scripture account of all men as descendants of  Adam  is  There is none righteous no not one there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after God They are all gone out of the way they are altogether become unprofitable there is none that doth good no not one  Rom  iii  ADAM and all his posterity were now  justly  accounted  guilty  by the law of their constitution they were first placed in both on account of the promise they despised and the authority of God they set at nought It would border upon profanity to say that the Almighty placed man under a  faulty  constitution for it seems to have been as well calculated for free agents that are  dependent  as any thing could be to answer an end The most mate∣rial objection that seem to have  any  weight in  it  is at the same time  full of impiety  namely that God ought to have prevented what he knew would so much tend to the  hurt  of his rational creaturesBut not to mention the  absurdity  of saying what the Almighty  ought  to have done we should rather conceive that God did things for the  best  and more especially as it was through an abuse of the  best  of  privileges  that man ruined  himself  Liberty is what all wise men account a valuable privilege and it is necessary to make rational creatures  accountable  and had man at first not been formed a free agent as far as a crea∣ture  can be  dependently free  he could neither had  merit  nor  demerit  It is sufficient to say that God made man upright and neither impelled him to the one side or the other and as he had power to do good or evil he is  justly  accountable for the abuse of  his liberty The only source of moral obligation is the divine will  and seeing God decla∣red that it was his pleasure that man should abstain from  the fruit of the forbidden tree  it was an act of the  highest  rebellion against God to gainsay his public declaration Man was therefore condemned for a  breach  of moral obli∣gation attended with the  highest  aggravations  IT would be needless to say what man lost through his disobediencethe favour of his Maker which is life and every other blessing that tends to happiness he forfeit∣ed  by sinning against God  It would be absurd to say that man could  really  enjoy  life  when he had lost the  favour  of his Maker in which  it  consistedwhat is therefore meant by death in the  full  extent of the word under this constitution is  misery  and  pain  as well as the  dissolution  of the body  through mortality  The fabric of this first consti∣tution was  totally  ruined as far as it respected human happiness and the weight of its fall would have sunk the whole human race down to  endless  misery had not the Almighty who knew all future events  beforehand  pro∣vided a remedy suitable to the breach made in that con∣stitution This law which man was made under stood in  full force  against  him  and as it was the first public re∣velation of God's will to which  he  had annexed a threaten∣ing where  his veracity  was concerned for the sake of his public credit as the just governor of the universe he deals with all men according to this  first  revelation of his will This  Law Covenant Revelation  or what you please to call it comes always  first  under consideration when the Almighty deals with men  As this is really the case that the Almighty begins with every man of  Adam  's posterity where their father ended and is obliged  in honour  to do so it appears  plainly  that  by the deeds of the law no flesh living can be justified  The Almighty cannot  in character  depart from the first publication of his will and men cannot  walk up to  it since Adam fell  but fall miserably short in  Principles Measure Motives  and  Ends  The consequence is they must either be miserable or  some other scheme  must be revealed suited to the character of God and the miserable condition of mankind The condition of man∣kind is very wretched through sinThey are in con∣sequence of the  justice  and  equity  of God as a  Lawgiver  expressed in  that law  given to man at first consigned over to  death  and  condemnation  they are held fast by the fetters of prejudice and corrupt affections and have neither  will  nor  inclination  to do the will of God Hence they are  doubly  in bondagebound over to condemna∣tion by the sanction of the law of Godand bound by their own corrupt affections as  slaves  to the  God of this world  Whatever different  Theories  men may have of this matter every man  in fact  feels the truth of this double bondagewhich they plainly discover by fears at death and enmity to truth while they live  SUCH is the state and condition of man that without a  Redeemer  he can have  no  hope of happiness nor  any  real pleasure in this life  Redemption  by  the blood of Jesus Christ  is necessary to  give hope  of happiness to men And  this  shall now be considered  AN ESSAY ON REDEMPTION  CHAP I  Shewing the  Nature  of  Redemption  according to  Scrip∣ture  wherein  it  consisteth and what  Qualifications  were requisite in the  Redeemer  to accomplish  it  SECT st  R  EDEMPTION in Scripture signifies the buying back something that is  lost alienated  or  mortgaged  or it signfies deliverance from  danger violence  or  oppression  It is applied to persons or things to either the  lives  or  estates  of men It always has relation to some  law of equity  and  moral justice  That redemption which our  Lord Jesus Christ  wrought for his people was also according to the  law  and  justice  of the first constitution which man was placed in It was observed in the introduction that the will of God is the  source of moral obligation  it was his revealed will that man should have kept that positive law he gave him in a state of innocence or in case he should transgress the precept that was given to him he should fall under the  weight  of  the threatening  and  forfeit  the  favour  of  his Maker  in which his true life and hap∣piness consisted for in the  favour  of the Almighty is life  yea it is in scripture said to be  better than life  in as much as moral satisfaction is  better  than  mere  creature existence The threatening implied what is death in a moral sense The  want  of friendship with God and in consequence thereof  pain  and  bitter  remorse of soul at the apprehen∣sion of the divine displeasure and the thoughts of  fu∣ture evil  THE Almighty placed our first parents under a  very casy  and equitable lawhe laid no heavier burthen upon them than  a single prohibition  to put them in mind of their dependence upon their Maker He gave them all things  richly  to enjoy and did not  sparingly  distribute his bounty unto them only as was just he put them in mind of their dependence by withholding from them the fruit of  a single tree  While man kept the  supremacy  and  moral character  of God in his eye there was no danger of his breaking his law but he forgot that he was de∣pendent and brake the law of his Maker by affecting to be  his equal  By affecting independence upon God who made him he became like  the beasts that perish  The threatening pursued him fast  For the Lord drove out the man  The presence of JEHOVAH in which a perfect creature cannot but have the  most exquisite  pleasure became dreadful to minds  so conscious  of their guilt  A∣dam  and his wife hid themselves from the Lord God among the trees of the garden  But  boundless mercy  which never had  any  motive but the Sovereign Pleasure from whence it flowed in  due time  revealed a Saviour and made known a reason of hope to man who had nothing in himself but every reason of despair A Saviour is pro∣mised and Redemption through his blood  The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head  But will God  truly  pass over the  spirit  and  intention  of his law to man and make  void  his Own word and declara∣tion in that positive affirmation of His holiness  In the day that thou eatest thou shalt die  Shall God's moral character as a righteous Legislator suffer for the sake of man  that is a worm  and the son of man  that is a worm  This would expose the character of the God of truth and give reason for rebellious mortals to  pre∣sume  upon his mercy and goodness Shall ever favour be  bestowed upon guilty man it must be in consistency with that  first revelation  which God made to the world If sinners be saved and redeemed from sin and punishment it must be  according to law  THE law which JEAOVAH gave to his rational crea∣ture man was  easy reasonable  and  light  and could be  no way  hard or difficult to  such  perfect creatures as our first parents wereand as this first moral precept was an abstract of all righteousness and implied all the duties which dependence upon the Almighty binds men to ob∣serve so  no deed  or  action  contrary to this law done by any in the nature of man could be lawful and right And supposing this law either broken or  strictly  observed it was still the condition of life and happiness to the posterity of  Adam  In keeping of it it is plain that  life  was the  reward  and in case  it  should be broken  death  should be  the wages    The wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life  Rom  vi  Upon supposition that man should  transgress  and be  exposed  to the curse of the law if any should be so wise mighty and merciful as to redeem him from his misery this law was still to come under the  first consideration  and the hap∣piness to be obtained must be consistent with  this abstract  of the  will  of  God  As God's moral character was concerned in this rule of righteousness and called in question by man's disobe∣dience so there was  no other way  known to us how his character and our salvation might be made consistent but by beginning where our first parents  failed  To have overlooked the first transgression of his law altogether would have represented man's duty not so necessary as God said it was when  He  annexed the threatening of  death  to  disobedience    In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die  For suppose we ought not to at∣tempt "to limit the holy one of Israel" in the exercise of his attributes nor say what he might or could do yet we may say according to what he has revealed to us in  his word  he could not have granted life to man with∣out first having respect to his own holy character ex∣pressed  in  his law  as  the Judge of all the earth he must do right  WHENEVER God intended to express his mercy and compassion towards miserable mortals it was necessary that his wisdom should devise a method whereby mercy and compassion might appear consistent with the truth of the divine threatening and the purity of the holy law We find from scripture that benevolence and wisdom are both conspicuous in the plan of man's happiness Wisdom in contriving a scheme where there is the  Greatest  good∣will to men and yet the divine law taken first into consi∣deration Benevolence in taking into consideration the case of  enemies wretched  and  miserable  and conferring favours upon them they never could have deserved This is clearly pointed out in the xl  Psal  ver  When sacrifice and offerings were not required  JEHOVAH the Messiah says  a body hast thou prepared me I de∣light to do thy will O my Godthy law I have within my heart  Christ was made under the very  same law  which the first man transgressed He was made subject to all  its  precepts to obtain a title to eternal life to all his seed according to the covenant of promise and subjected to  its  curse to redeem them from temporal spi∣ritual and eternal deathFrom temporal death as to its stingfrom spiritual death as to its powerand from eternal death as to its nature degrees and con∣sequences  THE  chief end  of man was to  glorify God  by doing  his will  and CHRIST had a  special  respect to this end "I delight to do thy will" The Redemption obtained by JESUS CHRIST and applied to believers is neither  more  nor  less  than a perfect fulfilling of the chief end of manwhich was  at first  and still is  to glorify God  and  to enjoy him for ever  CHRIST as our Redeemer was made  under the law of God  in all  its various forms  In the fullness of time God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adop∣tion of sons  Gal  iv  HE was made under the law in that form in which  it  was revealed to our first parents both as to  its command∣ment  and  curse  As a rule of righteousness it was the delight of his lifeand he called  it  with all the other forms of  it His Father's business  He was made under the law of God in its ceremonial form as connected with the doctrine of  all  the prophets  for he came not to de∣stroy the law and the prophets but to fulfil them  Matth  v  IT would lead me from my subject to give instances of each of themBut in a word That Redemption which our Redeemer perfected was according to all the known forms of the divine law But more than  all  it was perfectly conformable to the  spirit  of the  law  of  God  The  spirit  of our Saviour's obedience was quite answer∣able to the  intention  and  spirit  of the  law of God  The  principles  and  motives  from whence he  acted served  and  obeyed  were  holy just  and  pure  love to God and man were his  devoted principles  His motives were to glorify Him that sent him to deliver his people from wrath and make them happyHis end to give such a re∣presentation of God's moral character to the world as should appear quite consistent with itself and the first revelation of God to man In the Messiah those draughts of moral character  mercy  and  truth righteousness  and  peace  met together and in the  most  regular moral oeco∣nomy shewed the justice of the divine proceedings and vindicated the  ways of God to man  Whatever was in∣tended by the  spirit  of the  first law  and  revelation  of the  will of God  was by our Saviour's Redemption perfect∣ly fulfilled  THE best of men  even  when they observe the  letter  of the law of God are much defective as to the  springs  of action and fall much short of the spirit and design of God's holy commandmentBut CHRIST had the whole law in its  largest extent  and  compass  in  his heart  and could say with the strictest propriety  I have respect to all thy commandments  This Redemption which JESUS CHRIST perfected was according to law because  he was  appointed  to the office of Redeemer by the oath of God As the High Priest over the house of God he was consecrated and appointed to fulfil the law for those whom he represented as a High Priest  The Lord hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest for ever  Psal  cx  THE  Messiah  the son of the Highest was made a Priest by an  Oath  which is generally accounted the  most  solemn and  surest  ratification of  any deed law  or  office  The Apostle to the  Hebrews  says  that the word of the oath maketh the son a priest  Heb  vii  i e Mak∣eth him one in the divine appointment of JEHOVAH which is the same with  any  law that  ever  was revealed  OUR Saviour in his death and offering of himself an atonement for our sins had a  special  view to the law and appointment of God  I have power to lay down my life and power to take it up again this commandment have I received of my father  John  x  The High Priest who was a type of JESUS CHRIST upon the day of expiation was obliged to observe  strictly  the law of atonementfor upon it depended both his own life and the ceremonial remission of the sins of the congrega∣tion The least deviation from the law was death to the priest and non acceptance to the peopleThe whole congregation therefore stood without in  great fear  and  terror  in the outer court till the expiation was finished and the priest came out from the  holy of holies  What supported their hope in the midst of their fears was the  sound  of the  bells  that were upon the  hem  of his garments which were heard in the outer court  And it shall be upon Aaron and his sons to minister And his sound shall be heard when he goeth into the holy place be∣fore the Lord and when he cometh out that he die not  Exod  xxviii  And it is an evidence to us that  our High Priest  hath observed the law of the atone∣ment appointed himwhen  now  that he is gone to heaven the  holy place not made with hands  we hear the  sound  of his acceptance in the  Gospel  which publish∣eth "repentance and remission of sins through his blood" It is a sign that JESUS CHRIST our High Priest is alive and his sacrifice is accepted of as an atonement for his  church and people when  life  and  immortality  are publish∣ed through his death in the gospel to  the chief of sinners  I am alive  says he  for evermore and have the keys of hell and death  Rev  i  SECT d  THIS Redemption was  vicarious  or one redeeming others by being substitute in their place one paying a price of Redemption as a representative of others who were guilty JESTS CHRIST is in this respect  the surety of the better covenant  When  he  assumed the office of Redeemer he obliged himself to  do  and  perform  what his people  ought  to have done and to suffer what they ought to have sufferedAll the  sinofferings  under the law were  types  and  figures  of  him  and had their  full  accomplishment in that offering which he made of him∣self in the fullness of time It was impossible that the whole human race or  any  individual amongst  them  could make a sufficient atonement for their guiltman's Re∣demption would have ceased  for ever  for all that any mor∣tal could have done to obtain it  But the Lord laid on him the iniquities of us all  and in his mercy pro∣vided for himself a  true  sinoffering  THERE was a transmutation of guilt from the  prin∣ciple  to the  surety  which in scripture is called  bearing our sins  Our Redeemer is said  to bear our sins on his own body on the tree    Pet  ii  The words  might read thus  Who himself listed up our sins in his own body upon the Tree  viz the  cross  which he could not have done unless they had been imputed to him or transferred upon him The Apostle seems to refer to  Isa  liii where the prophet says  He was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed  The original words are very strong and much more expressive than our translation  Vebu me∣cholal mipshanem meducah meavonotenu musar shelemenu Gnalav Ubacka∣burato nirpah  They may be thus rendered  He was pierced through for our iniquities he was bruised to dust for our sins The transferring of our punish∣ment was upon him and by his stripes we are made whole  These words ex∣press the sufferings of Christ in the  strongest  manner and point out the reason and the effects of them clearly and emphatically  The reasons of our acceptance with God and the cause of our sanc∣tification are plainly pointed out in them If we compare the words in this passage with the th verse of this chap and with these words God sp  ke from the excellent Glory  This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased  it will be found that God is  only  perfectly pleased with his own son and with finners for what he hath done and suffered  As our guilt is pardoned  only  on account of what Christ hath suffered so the wounds and moral bruises of our souls by sin are healed by his stripes  THAT this was the case we have no reason to doubt if we believe divine revelation for the scripture is both  full  and  plain  on this subject  Isa  liii  All we like lost sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all  Pet  ii who himself bare our sins on his own body on the tree  Cor  v For he hath made him sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him  Pet  iii For Christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God be∣ing put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit  If words have any meaning at all those texts must point out one suffering for anotherand since God has so assured us in his word of this truth it would be presumption in us to say it was inconsistent with  his character  to demand satisfaction when he has told us the contrary by his own  express testimony  DR SIKES and some others would willingly explain away the meaning of these passages without giving them a  better  yea without giving them any meaning at all and say they cannot mean a  vicarious  Redemption for this would be contrary to the character of GodBut how came those  Critics  to be  better  informed what was suitable to the divine character than the Deity himself It is evident from both the Old and New Testaments that the Almighty did not want those passages to have  any  other meaning than  a common  reader may find at  first instance  because he has often repeated them after the same manner and does not seem to have thought that understanding them so would injure his character In scripture where the Almighty speaks in a mystical and  figurative manner it is plain he does not want to have his words understood  literally  and always explains  his meaning  by other plain passages of scriptureBut with regard to  those  already cited we do not find  any  other passages when taken in their  connection  and  scope  that lead us to any other meaning  ONE would be ready to apprehend that such literary censors are more zealous for their own pride than for the character of the Deity and rather suppose what they themselves would do if they were in his place than what they are sure is his mind and will What their wisdom thinks best they conclude is fittest for the cha∣racter of their makerand have the  assurance  to say what  he ought  to do even when he has said the quite contraryNor will they allow the Deity to be the properest judge of his own character They have a  standard quite  above both God and the Scriptures name∣ly their  own natural notions  What is not suitable to  these  they will not allow to be consistent with either the divine character or common senseNothing is more contrary and inconsistent with  their notions  than  vicarious  Redemption when it implies punishment It is indeed surprising that these wise men who know the character of the Deity so well by their natural notions should give such visible demonstrations of their ignorancewhen in every branch of their conduct in very momentous matters they are not  very  studious to imitate  that  character they pretend to know more than other people They tell us that the Almighty is all goodness which no sober man will deny more than they but will perhaps say that he is as much all justice equity and holinessBut not to say  any thing  of the absurdity of pretending to say what the Deity iswhich no man can tell further than he himself hath revealed it might be expected if they believed the Almighty was  so very good  that they would imitate his character If indulging the passions and gra∣tifying the appetites be imitations of God in goodness those devotees of goodness have made  considerable  attain∣mentsThey can receive bondsmen for debts throw debtors into jail domineer over their inferiors and de∣pendents like other menand if their lives and conduct  be a real imitation of their  Deity  they are in some jeo∣pardy notwithstanding of that goodness they have learned by their natural notions They in real life express as much vengeance towards those who injure or offend them as the  rest  of their fellow men that differ from them in sentiment and when  fairly  provoked forget what they profess to believe concerning their MakerAnd though they conceive the Deity to be so good as to demand no satis∣faction yet they want to be satisfied themselves Such conduct is a  burlesque  of their pretended belief and makes  them  truly ridiculous If the Deity they profess to wor∣ship be as unmerciful as they themselves are notwith∣standing of that goodness they boast of they are in dan∣ger of being miserable enough But after all it seems not more inconsistent with God to accept of a  vicarious  Atonement or Redemption and CHRIST to give it than it was inconsistent with him to make the world For if we consider the character of God revealed to us in his word and not what our  natural notions  suggest we will find it drawn in such a manner that this world as it now appears is not answerable to that character  i e  it is nothing in comparison with what God could have made itAnd we may as well complain of God for not making us angels as complain of his conduct for re∣quiring an atonement for our sinsfor God was good before Time as well as after it commenced and according to  some people's natural notions  of goodness should have made man so that he could not have fallenor in other words made him a Deity for this is the language of pride "ye shall be as Gods"  THERE was  certainly  necessity for a  vicarious  Redemp∣tion otherwise God would not have required  any  but in his dispensations towards the  Jews vicarious atonements  were among the first institutions that were made  a part  of their religious  oeconomy  The Apostle to the  Hebrews  in∣forms us that all these  vicarious  atonements were shadows of  Christ to come  yea that the whole  Tabernacle  and  Temple  service were figures of JESUS CHRIST the true Messiah And we are expressly told that  he came in the end of time to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself  Heb  x That he was manifested to take away sin and in him was no sin    John  iii  IT seems to have been the common opinion of all na∣tions where  any  notions of God ever entered that there was necessity for  vicarious Atonements  for all nations who  e story we have mentioned  in history  had some ri∣tuals of this sort in their religious worshipBut  com∣mon sense  tells us that it is not inconsistent with the Al∣mighty's goodness to demand a  vicarious  Redemption for what is the meaning of requiring satisfaction for the breach of human laws if this notion of satisfaction be not taken from  some notices  we have received from the Deity If it be good for civil government which all men for the most part agree is from God  thus  to demand  satisfaction  in the lower  system  of his administration it cannot well be supposed inconsistent with his goodness to demand sa∣tisfaction in the more exalted part of his government  THAT this Redemption was  vicarious  will appear from the  very goodness of God  made use of against its necessity For how was it consistent with the Divine Goodness to make CHRIST suffer such grievous sorrows if he was in no sense guiltyFor it is agreed on all hands that he had no sin of his own It is abundantly evident from scripture that there never were  any sorrow  like unto his  Is it nothing unto you all ye that pass by Behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow which is done unto me wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger  Lam  i  Could there be any thing more tyrannical and arbitrary than to make an innocent person undergo such grievous sufferingswhen JEHOVAH from the excellent glory had declared he was well pleased with him In punishing an offender there is  nothing unjust  or contrary to the nature of moral goodnessbut to punish an innocent person  so well approved  of by God is not so  easily  accounted for Re∣velation  only  can satisfy us as to this  He bare our sins in his own body on the tree  Pet  ii The Lord laid on him the iniquities of us all  Isa  liii  IF JESUS CHRIST came to set us an example of pa∣tience  and resignation to the will of God under all our afflictions and sufferingsand this was all that was in∣tended by his deathWhy did God himself afflict him so grievously in his soul with such  horrible terrors  which made the very blood sweat from his body when there were no visible trouble upon him This does not well agree with the character of the Almighty  Who doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men without a a cause  There was certainly  something more  than ex∣ample here otherwise it was all in vain for never man was or will be able to copy after itWhat had  almost  broke the heart of our Redeemer would  altogether  break the hearts of the sons of men JESUS CHRIST himself seems to have had  quite  different views in his sufferings for he says to those who came to apprehend him  If ye seek me let these go their way  John  xviii  He seems plainly to have considered himself as a  vicarious Redeemer  one substitute in the room and place of others But if CHRIST came only to instruct us as a Prophet and to set us an example by his sufferings he has set be∣fore us the  most fearful example  that ever was set before  mortals  An example of bearing the punishment of sin and the wrath of God due on account of our iniquity Ah fearful example Tremendous pattern Who among the sons of men can follow the footsteps of such a Savi∣our What  so severely  scorched the green tree would effectually burn up all the dry onesand unless men were qualified in the same degree that CHRIST was his  very  example would be a sufficient hell to them Ye fol∣lowers of CHRIST upon this plan Could you follow him to the garden of  Gethsemene  with all that anguish of soul which he suffered there Could you undergo such a bloody sweat as JESUS did and live  NONE but a divine person could endure such grief and sorrow as were inflicted upon JESUS CHRISTand un∣less CHRIST could endow his people with the same de∣gree of perfection power and holiness that was in him it would be impossible to copy his pattern  THAT our Redeemer did bear the wrath of God the scriptures affirm expressly  Thy wrath lieth hard upon  me and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves Thy fierce wrath goeth over me thy terrors have cut me off  Psal  lxxxviii  It is because the chas∣tisement of our peace was upon him that he suffered such grievous sorrows and because he came in the room of the guilty that he suffered unto deathand not m  rely to set us an example  He gave himself a ransom to redeem us from all iniquity and to purify unto himself a pe∣culiar people zealous of good works  From all which it appears evident that our LORD's Redemption was  vi∣carious  SECT d  THIS Redemption was a procuring of that inheritance which man lost Man's portion and inheritance where∣by he could have lived happy and enjoyed life was the favour and fellowship of his MakerThis enjoyment he forfeited by breaking the divine law and transgressing the holy commandmentMan was driven from his in∣heritance and became a vagabond upon the earth for re∣nouncing his allegiance to the Almighty He had no∣thing after he had sinned that he could call his own but what he would have been better without namely the divine displeasure threatened in the sanction of the law of worksAnd besides he was miserable by what he had lost All enjoyments whatsoever unless connected with the divine favour tend only to make the curse sit faster upon guilty minds It is only in the favour of God there is life all other vital acts are only the shadow of lifeFor without the favour of God a man is dead while he liveth When God created man at first he made him lord of this lower world and heir of everlasting felicity in the next upon condition that he should obey that law which he gave him as the test of his dependence upon him and his acknowledgment of his Maker's so∣vereignty His faithful service for a season would have entitled him to a crown of immortal lifebut he sold himself to Satan for the pleasures of sense and lost his liberty by gratifying his taste  By seeking to become  wise he became a fool  and marred his happiness by stretching its limits beyond the divine prohibition By giving himself up to be the servant of sin and Satan God in righteous judgment condemned him to be their slaves and instead of that blessed inheritance of immortal life he had reason as the son of God to expect if he had con∣tinued in his service he was made a slave to the devil and a subject of death Through pride and seduction he lost an inheritance which would have for ever enriched both him and his posterity  Now man is miserable for wanting what only can make him happy and is not able to pay a ransom for what he hath lost But God who is abundant in love and infinite in mercy sent his son in human naturewho hath given his life's blood to redeem the lost inheritance The strong One JEHOVAH's partner the Man his Fel∣low or of his Right Hand was sent to redeem that fore∣feited inheritance that his "little ones might not perish but have everlasting life" This holy life and obedience which we call active to distinguish it from his passion and sufferings is the meritorious reason of men's being received again into the favour of God It was through disobedience that man lost the favour of his Maker and it is by obedience that any of fallen  Adam  's posterity are restored to it againFor  as by one man's disobedi∣ence many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous  Rom  v  But before our Redeemer could procure the favour of God as an in∣heritance to eternal life it was necessary that he should be related to those for whom he was to obtain it  That question whether JESUS CHRIST procured the love of God is a very needless one Had those who moved it attended to the plain meaning of words they would never have proposed it  Love and Benevolence in as far as we know any thing of them are the same namely Sovereign Good Pleasure Favour and Accep∣tance also signify the same thing and may be expressed by the word Friendship Though JESUS CHRIST did not procure the Divine good will yet he obtained our acceptance with God The Apostle tells us  Eph  ii  That through him we have access by one spirit to the Father  which the Apostle to the  Hebrews  says is obtained by the blood of CHRIST  Heb  x  Having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the bood of Jesus  The Almighty according to his moral character expressed in the first public revelation of his will is a declared enemy to sin and as the Su∣preme and righteous Governor of the world an enemy to sinners on account of it But this implies no more than the opposition of his in∣finitely perfect moral character to the guilty and vile character of sinners  There is no such passion in the Divine nature as  a  redit is only the opposition of his nature to what is opposite to and unlike itself  God bestows his love or goodwill sovereignly without any reason out of himself He loves because he pleasethBut his favour and friend∣ship are bestowed upon the guilty for moral considerations He g  ve his son freely and sovereignly without any reason but his good plea∣surebut he bestows his favours upon sinners for his son's s  ke  Isa  liii  By his knowledge shall my righteous servant make many righteous for he shall carry their iniquities imposed upon him  Where the connection between our Saviour's bearing the sins of his peo∣ple and their justification is manifest The Divine goodwill and plea∣sure is the source of all grace and favour to guilty menbut the blood of JESUS CHRIST is the channel through which these favours are con∣veyed to them The first channel through which the favour of God was conveyed to the world was stopt by the offence of our first parents Fa∣vour friendship and acceptance with God could no more run in that channelBut JESUS CHRIST by giving his life's blood for that offence hath opened "a new and living way" whereby grace and fa∣vour "might reign through his righteousness" to the most worthless and chief of sinners consistently with JEHOVAH's moral character ex∣pressed in the first revelation of his will  The Divine love or goodwill considers all the chosen of God as one in CHRIST but his grace and favour respect them as many members of the one body The Almighty had but one goodwill to all his peo∣ple as the body of CHRIST which he expressed in  chusing them in him before the world began  But his favours are many according to the number and wants of his members It is agreed almost on all hands that man lost the favour of God by transgressing his lawIt is also manifest from scripture that man's life lies in the favour of his Maker If this is really the case that the first man lost life and happi∣ness by forfeiting the favour of the Almighty it is as manifest that the second man obtained it to his people by procuring his favour Eter∣nal life which lies in the favour of God is now bestowed through the channel of a ransom or purchase which our Redeemer paid to remove the forfeiture of happiness by shedding his blood  The Apostle tells us  that the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord  for though our Redeemer paid the ransom price of his blood for the christian's inheritance it is still the gift of God to us as much as it had never been procured by pricebecause we can give nothing for its ransomBesides it was JEHOVAH himself that provided and was pleased to admit a Goal According to the first revelation of the will of God Redemption was necessary to clear the character of the Lawgiver from all imputation of unrighteousnessand  so he shewed in all his afterdealings with men a respect to that first revelation  But to fulfil the pupose of his goodwill he provided a Goal or Kins∣man Saviour who should fulfil the whole of the first law as to both the  letter  and  spirit  of it and thereby open free access to sinners to the fa∣vour and friendship of God With respect to that first law the death of CHRIST was in reality a ransom price For he came into the world to fulfil it Eternal life is the purchase of CHRIST as far as it respects that l  w which threatened everlasting punishment but it is the gift of God as far as God provided a Redeemer and was pleased to admit of a furety None of these things according to the spirit of the first reve∣lation he was obliged to do Eternal life the Apostle tells us  was given to us in Christ Jesus before the world began  But it was given to him to work out by his obedience unto deathso by his death he wrought out eternal life Believers therefore obtain eternal life by a  work which Christ finished upon the cross  Fallen men are like a son banish∣ed from his father's house for breaking the laws of the family and re∣belling against his father The father according to the laws of his house cannot receive his son into favour without some atonement and satisfac∣tion for the rebellion against his supremacy for if he should it would shew that his laws were of no weightYet notwithstanding his good∣will to his prodigal son inclines him to find out a friend or prevail with the elder brother to pay the prodigal son's ransomthat he may again receive him into favour and the rest of his dependents may see how righ∣teous and just he isand his son may feel how gracious and good both his father and elder brother are  The love and benevolence of the father is the reason of him prevail∣ing with the elder brother to pay the ransombut it is the ransom which the elder brother pays that is the reason of the prodigal's being again received into favour The younger brother is justified and ac∣quitted from the guilt on account of the elder brother becoming his  Goal  or  Red  emer  Dr  Gill  and some others by not attending to the plain distinction be∣tween  Benevolence  and  Favour  have endeavoured to support an eternal justification of the electand because God out of his good pleasure de∣creed to justify them have concluded that they are really justified But they ought to have considered that the divine love is not the reason in law whereby sinners are acquitted from the guilt of an  evil action  but  som  deed  conformable to the moral justice and equity expressed in the first publication of the will of GodFor upon the same principles that eternal justification is built uponeternal guilt and condemnation may also be supportedAlso the eternal existence of men and the revelation of a law to them  for where there is no law there is no trans∣gression  The sons of God were like  Absolom  in the land of the  Philistines out of savour  but the King's goodwill or love was not abated towards them It was God's benevolence that made him send his son to pay the price of man's Redemption that he might consistently with that public character which he first assumed as a  lawgiver  to men receive sinners into favour CHRIST's doing and suffering were all that law and justice  could demand and were fully as powerful and prevalent to restore the guilty to favour as man's disobedience was to cast him out of it  IT was by his holy active obedience that he procured that favour which man lost by his sin and transgression  The whole human race had forfeited their right to com∣munion and fellowship with Godso there was a forfei∣ture  upon their inheritance which was necessary to be re∣moved before they could again enter upon the possession This forfeiture our LORD JESUS CHRIST paid by his obe∣dience unto death and hath restored his people into the forfeited favour of God and makes them partakers of those divine pleasures that are in his presence It was con∣tinuing in the service of God that would have secured the inheritance of eternal life to manand it was by our first parents their coming short before the time of probation was ended that they and their seed lost that inheritance  For cursed is he that continueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them  Had there been no sanction annexed to the law then any person who had been able to have taken up the  a  k where  Adam  left it might have set all to right again But justice had a claim for satisfaction by virtue of the curse annexed to the law  in the day thou eatest there∣of thou shalt die  Our Redeemer was therefore o∣bliged to fulfil that law which man left unfinished that he might procure access into the divine favourand also to bear the cursethat the justice and truth of JEHOVAH's character might appear in reinstating man into the fa∣vour of his Maker But as man was also himself a pri∣soner as well as an insolvent debtor to justice there was still something more necessary  SECT th  THIS Redemption which CHRIST accomplished for his people was a Redemption of persons There was a necessity of loosing the bonds of the prisoners and of opening the prison doors as well as procuring a good in∣heritance in the enjoyment of the favour of God The divine favour is what the servants of sin cannot enjoy because they are Satan's captives and led by him at his pleasure This Redemption of the persons of believers was twofold according to the nature of their bondage They were bound over by a just sentence of the law to  death and were arrested at the instance of justice and could not get clear ti  l the uttermost farthing was paid In this sense they are held like persons under attainder as guilty of treason against the Sovereign of heaven and earth Nothing but the  price of blood  could release them so the Prophet informs us  That by the blood of the covenant Christ brings forth the prisoners out of the pit wherein there is no water  He paid the price of their Redemption by his precious blood and died to re∣scue them out of the prison of spiritual and eternal death He paid their ransom by his blood and hath delivered them from going down to the pitBy virtue of this ransom their persons became his property and he s  ts them free agreeable to both law and justiceHence they are justified and acquitted from the curse by which they were heldwhich like a heavy chain held them fast in the prison of spiritual deathso that they were unable to move in  any  holy acts of duty towards God  The curse of the law hinders men in the practice of moral duty because it leaves them no hopeswithout which no man living will pur∣sue virtuous actions It is the hope of the glory of God that makes men rejoice in tribulations suffer patiently unto the endbut no man can have any reason of hope who is under the curse  BUT not only are men as they are the descendants of the first  Adam  prisoners of justice but they are also captives to sin and Satan made to grind in his prisonhouse by serving divers lusts and pleasures Christ redeems them from Satan's dominion by his power as he delivers them from justice by the price of his bloodSo hereby the captives are delivered  and the prey of the terrible taken away  THIS deliverance the Redeemer performs by the gospel which is the "rod of his strength sent out of mount Zion" whereby he pulls down Satan's kingdom and relieves his people Satan that cruel enemy of man's happiness is not willing to part with his captives and notwithstanding of their ransom being paid endeavours to hold them fast in the fetters of sin and prejudiceBut  their Re∣deemer is mighty the LORD OF HOSTS is his name  Jer  l  He sends his powerful word  come forth  and all the powers of hell cannot hold them longer  THE gospel as the rod of CHRI  T's power bruiseth Satan under his people's feet and persuades and enables them to flee from the wrath to come This part of the Redemption which our Redeemer performs consists in changing the purposes of his people's minds by the su∣perior evidence of the gospel of peace It is by the A∣postle  Rom  viii  called a fulfilling of the law in them  This is a Redemption of the persons of be∣lievers with a strong hand and belongs to JESUS CHRIST under the character of a Conqueror  travelling in the greatness of his strength  The gospel which is a  stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to the Greeks is the power of God and the wisdom of God in calling his people out of darkness into his marvelous light  The word of truth however simple in itself is by the evidence which the spirit that speaks in it gives it  mighty through God to pull down strong holds and every imagination that exalteth itself against the kingdom of Christ  Its evidence ariseth from its simplicity and is not like  the enticing words of man's wisdom  which please those who belong to the king∣doms of this world It flatters no man while in a state of sin or while living in the practice of it but plainly tells him his doom while he remains in that condition But at the same time  proclaims liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison doors to those who are bound  It exhibits very great and precious promises to all who believe in JESUS CHRIST and affords the surest reason of hope to the miserable and wretched It speaks nothing but woes to hypocrites and such as go about to establish a righteousness of their own for it  calls not the righteous but sinners to repentance  This gospel looks with no favourable aspect upon such as are seeking requisities to prepare them to come to CHRIST but looks benignly upon the poor the miserable the blind and the naked It says not one word of peace or pardon to the wise man or the disputer of this world while it scatters its influence among those who are ac∣counted worst by the sons of pride  THIS word of JESUS CHRIST which saves men from the power of sin and the captivity of the Devil has in∣deed an influence upon its enemiesbut it is to torment them as it doth their father the Devil  who believes and trembles  The same word that begets faith in the souls of those who are called and gives hope and great joy to the wretched and miserable among men begets pain and remorse in the consciences of the proud and torment in the minds of Devils Though this faith which the gospel produces and brings forth has received the opprobrious name of the faith of Devils yet it is the word of CHRIST's patience and power which begets in the souls of his chosen people a belief of the same truth which makes those evil spirits tremble The faith of saints and devils is no way different the difference lies in their hopes The one hath no hope from the truth they believe but pain and sorrow whereas the others from the same truth have a noble reason of hope which revives and supports their minds  WHENEVER any man believes the truth of the gos∣pel as firmly as the Devils do it presents to him a ground of hope that overbalanceth all his reasons of despair Among those inhabitant of the regions of dark∣ness notwithstanding of their believing the truth their reasons of despair outweigh their reasons of hopebe∣cause the gospel is not sent to themBut to men under every guilty circumstance it says  to you is the word of this salvation sent  JESUS CHRIST delivers his people when they are in captivity by opening their eyes and pointing out to them the way of escape He opens men's blinded understand∣ings by the light of his gospel and brings them  out of darkness into his marvelous light  The scripture calls this a  turning them from darkness unto light and from the power of Satan unto God  When Sa∣tan got man into his prison he did with him as the  Phi∣listines  did with  Sampson  put out his eyes and it is through ignorance that he holds them in his power For whenever the light is made to shine into their hearts  they break his prison and escape Hence the gospel saves men by making them  know the things which belong to their peace  In this respect knowledge is the principle of faith and faith the exercise of know∣ledgeFor  only those who know JEHOVAH's name will put their trust in him  The gospel becomes a principle of understandingwhich by its own evidence be∣gets assent to its truth in the soul which in scripture hath received the name of  Faith  This faith is termed  the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen  Or as that passage may more properly be read  The firm foundation of things hoped for and the  argument  or  proof  of things not seen  The tes∣timony of God made known to men is the firm foun∣dation of faith and faith is the argument or proof to us of the truth and reality of what is testified The gospel gives being to faith and faith realizes the object to us or gives it a real existence in our souls It is by the power of CHRIST's word that the souls of his people escape out of the snares of the Devil and forsake his service  SECT th  THIS Redemption is meritorious It is not  merely  an allusive and figurative oneWhen CHRIST is called a Redeemer it is not because  Moses Joshua David  and others were so called but because he is really a Saviour and Redeemerwho paid the price of our Redemption The price he paid was truely worthy of all that ever his people can receive on account thereof It is a suffi∣cient reason and argument in law and equity why God should justify the ungodly The merit of this Redemp∣tion arose from the nature and dignity of the person who paid the price of it Our Saviour was truly God as well as very man  The modern enemies of our SAVIOUR begin to sneer at such phrase as the above and like  Nicodemus  are ready to say  how can thesethings be  And what they are not able to refute with any shew of reason or  argument they endeavour to turn into  ridicule  Yet one may easily perceive that they smile  but aukwardly  for the force of scripture evidence being so  very  clear against  them  makes them  on occasions  betray  some  de∣gree of  concern  mixed with their  irrefragable smile  It would require a good degree of critical knowledge to enable any man to explain away the meaning of so many plain passages of holy scripture which at first view seem to point out this truth that the  Messiah is God  as well as  Man  For at the same time that he assumes the title of our  Goal  and  Kinsman Saviour  he takes to himself the highest name that ever is assumed by the  Creator  of the  Universe  Isa xliv  Ka omar Jehovah Melech Israel vegoalo Jehovah sabaoth Ani Rishon va ani acharon U mib∣bal Gnadi in Elokim  Thus saith JEHOVAH  King of Israel  and  his kins∣man Redeemer  the Lord JEHOVAH of Hosts  I am the first and the last and besides me there is no God  Comp  red with Rev i    I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end saith the Lord who is who was and  s to come the Almighty  Isa xliv  Ka Omar Jehovah Goaleka vejitzerka mibbaten anki Jehovah Gnoshe Kol note sham∣ajim Lebadi rokagn haaretz mejitti  Thus saith the Lord thy kinsman Redeemer I formed thee from the womb I am he who made all things I alone stretched forth the heavens and by myself spread abroad the earth Isa xli  Altiri Tolaath Jakol mete Israel ani Asarttick Neum Jehovah vegoalck Kedosh Israel  Fear not worm Jacob and ye men of Israel I Jehovah your kinsman Redeemer the holy one of Israel will help you Compared with Acts iii  And ye denied the holy one and the just  I am inclined to think that wherever JEHOVAH is in scripture repre∣sented as a  Goal  or  kinsman Redoemer  that the Messiah is meant  Jacob  gives this name of  Goal  to an angel which could be no other but the angel of the covenant Gen xlviii  Hamalach hagoaloti Michal roagn  The angel my kinsman Redeemer from all evilwhich our version reads "hath redeemed me from all evil"  Job  xix gives the like character to the Messiah  Jadgnati Goali hai veacharon algnaphar jakum  I know that my kinsman Redeemer is living and that at last he shall stand upon the dust of the earth  It would be but kind in those who will not allow the Messiah to be the true God to give us some good reason why he assumes such names and affirms that he hath performed such works as none but the  Supreme  can justly claim or is able to perform The old  Jewish  principles rule still in the hearts of the children of disobedience for they cannot un∣derstand the consistence of Jesus's claim to such a high character when he was pleased to appear in such a low one  hat is to say unless they are able to understand as  much  as their Maker they will not be∣lieve  him  and the relation his work had to his in∣finitely  holy person gave it a value worthy of all that sinners can ever stand in need of It is for this reason that our Redeemer is so highly exalted as Mediator because being the true God he humbled himself unto the death The Actions of our Saviour's human nature re∣ceived an infinite value and dignity from their being the  works of him who is "the true God and eternal life" No finite creature can ever receive  more  or  greater  favours than our Redeemer merited by his deathFor this reason there is an eternity ordained for the enjoyment of themthat what can never be exhausted may be ever en∣joyed The song of the redeemed in heaven is filled with the worth and excellence of JESUS CHRIST and his Redemption  Rev  v  Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive glory honour dominion and powerFor thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood  CHAP II  The Qualifications necessary to fit the Redeemer to perform Man's Redemption  SECT st  IT was necessary that our Redeemer should be a party in that covenant according to which sinners were to be saved No person who was not able and worthy to treat with JEHOVAH and to engage his heart to approach unto him could be qualified to redeem lost sinners And suppose he had been qualified yet if he had not ac∣tually done it he would have wanted a true legal qualifi∣cation for his work Such as do act for others in mat∣ters where law is concerned do not merely act according to their ability and personal endowments but according to the law that relates to the transaction Personal endow∣ments were essentially necessary but mutual and actual engagements were morally necessary also As our LORD JESUS CHRIST intended to redeem his people it was ne∣cessary for him as their covenanthead to be mutually en∣gaged for them in a contract mutually with his Father and their Godthat so the will of the parties engaged might be one joint counselSo the Prophet tells us that  the council of peace was between them both  Zech  vi  Had not CHRIST been a party in the cove∣nant of peace all that he did could not have been answer∣able  to the breach of the covenant of works The first covenant was broken by  Adam  as a party in it and his posterity were ruined in consequence thereofso the children of our Redeemer are saved from the ruin of the first covenant by his being a party in the second I have saith God  made a covenant with my chosen  Psal  lxxxix  By our Redeemer being a party in the covenant of grace he was qualified to plead the benefits of his redemption for his people when the conditions in that covenant were fulfilled and could plead the original contract as a party that was worthy to covenant with GodThus by having really covenanted for guilty sinners he was qualified to ascertain the number of his seedthrough his knowledge of the contract in which he was a partyAnd could plead the word of the Fa∣ther in that covenant made with him  when he shall make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed and prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand  With regard to all this as a party in the covenant of peace he could say Lord do as thou hast said  OUR Redeemer's being a party in the new covenant qualified him to know both the number of his spiritual seed and the great and good things that are laid up for them in the covenant of grace and promise In conse∣quence thereof he could very properly pardon sin and for∣give the iniquity of the guilty because he knew what he had contracted for in their behalf and what he was able to do in fulfilling his contract Had not our Saviour been a party in that covenant his suretyship could have no way been answerable to the necessity of guilty man who needed one substituted in his place as a covenantparty It was entirely owing to the first  Adam  's being a party in the first covenant that his posterity were found guilty for the breach of it and it is because JESUS CHRIST is a party in the second covenant that his righteousness in fulfilling it as their surety is the reason of their accep∣tance with God Our Saviour's righteousness could not have been a covenant one unless he had been a party in it So it was an essential qualification to JESUS CHRIST our Saviour to be a party in the covenant of grace  SECT d  IT was an essential qualification in our Redeemer to be related to both God and man Man's Redemption could not have been effected by any not truly God and really manFor Deity could not suffer and a mere man could not have given such a ransom as was answer∣able to the spirit of the law and the demands of justice And moreover as man had offended God and incurred his just displeasure by disobedience it was necessary the Reconciler should be able to please God and restore man into his favour  When we speak of CHRIST reconciling us to GOD I know that some alledge that no more is meant than taking away of the enmity of our minds against himBut the scripture seems to signify something more that CHRIST had to peform a work whereby it might appear consistent with GOD's holy character to express himself well pleased towards them who have offended himAnd though nothing which CHRIST did made any change in the Divine mind yet it makes a great alteration in his conduct towards man  THE most perfect man that ever existed even the human nature of JESUS CHRIST unless it had been u∣nited to the Deity could not have effected man's Re∣demptionFor the most perfect finite service could merit no more than a finite reward and the death of a finite person could not in the nature of the thing be a price of Redemption from an infinite cursejustly pro∣nounced against sin wherever it should be found or in whatever form  THERE were two things which made it impossible for a mere man to redeem a guilty worldThe nature of justice required that there should be adequate satisfac∣tion made for the offence committed that the character of the Most High might be justified in justifying the un∣godly Though we may conceive many things which we think the Almighty might do or have done so far as they respect our interest yet we are not certain that he could have done otherwiseOn the contrary we are rather sure that he could not morally have acted other∣wise or than he would have done it It is not our part  to say what our Maker could have done as to his power or any other attribute of his naturebut whether ac∣cording to the system of his government revealed to us could he have acted otherwise agreeable thereto Was the first system which man was placed in perfect And did God speak in earnest when he said  in the day thou eatest thou shalt die  Will it not appear more con∣formable to that system that a perfect satisfaction be given to his justice expressed in his law by one who was able to give it than that the Divine character be any way ob∣scured in its truth and veracity  IT was therefore necessary that our Redeemer should be God and Man or EMMANUELthat he might be able to support the moral character of the Deity by giving a righteous and perfect obedience conformable to that lawwhich was an exact image of his character and might be able to give satisfaction to what truly may be called justice to make a complete Redemption con∣formable to the truth and holiness of God Thus quali∣fied he could give all the satisfaction the purest justice could exact in the same nature that had given the of∣fenceNor does this represent religion in any unfa∣vourable point of light or set forth the Almighty as cruel and capriciousWhen out of his mercy he found a chosen onewho at the same time that he repaired that awful breach could suffer no loss to himself  HAD what JESUS CHRIST did for sinners ruined him∣self or had death been able to detain him prisoner or had the making of men eternally happy made him miserable then might the enemies of the atonement called the scheme of man's redemption a cruel schemeand the Deity severeBut when the sufferings of JESUS CHRIST were salutary to men and in the event exalted the cha∣racter of the Most High in the esteem of men and angels and brought honour to our Redeemer also there does not appear any thing in the whole scheme but what is con∣sistent with perfect goodness Yea it exalts the goodness and extolls the love of God  SECT d  IT was necessary that the human nature which CHRIST assumed should be perfectly innocent Had our Saviour's human nature had either original or actual sin it could not have been a proper sinofferingfor in this case he would have needed an atonement for his own iniquity But that nature which he assumed though it was equally related to the believing seed of  Abraham  yet it was not par∣taker of any of that pollution which is common to the nature of man This human nature of JESUS CHRIST was sanctified by the Holy Ghost and brought forth in an extraordinary manner of a virginand though of the same kind with that of others was yet free of that na∣tural pollution which stains the best services of such where it prevailsBut JESUS CHRIST  was holy harmless undefiled and separated from sinners  without sin nor was guile found in him His sacrifice was sinless and perfect as well as divinely pure and holyon account of its relation to him who is the true GOD Though as a surety he was accounted guilty as bearing our sinsyet was he ever separated from sinners in respect of every moral impurity  THE pure law could not find the smallest defect in his sinoffering nor could the severest justice spy the least imperfection in that nature which was given him for a sacrifice  THERE was a passive innocence in the human nature of JESUS CHRISTwhereby he was morally inoffensive He had no disposition to give or to take offence as is common among menHe had no selfish pride in him nor any inordinate passions arising from the connection between his soul and body Passions and appetites not subordinate to pure reason and the will of God are pe∣culiar to corrupt and imperfect creatures In CHRIST there were none such He had no ambition to make him envy or grieve at the good of others but he constantly rejoiced to see men happy and to make them so All the  affections of his human soul were passively pure and holy and could not be moved to think or do evil  BUT this was not all the purity of his nature did not merely dispose him to do no evil or injury to any but it inclined him to seek men's happiness on all occasions "He went continually about doing good" from a holy propensity of mind towards what was worthy and virtuous Our Redeemer had no occasion to be excited to do good by any motives from withoutfor he had the law of God in his heart He had a perfect knowledge of moral rec∣titude and a perfect love of all truth  Thou lovest righteousness and hatest iniquity therefore God thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of joy above thy fellows  Psal  xiv  It was as natural for him to love truth as it is for other men under the influence of corruption to err and go astray from it It was the love of righteousness which constantly inclined him to do his Father's wil  and made him pursue the great end for which be came into the worldwhich was  to seek and save that which was lost  SECT th  IT was necessary that he should be appointed and have instructions for his office of Redeemer Without a spe∣cial appointment and proper instructions the execution of any office would be intrusion Natural endowments may fit a person for the execution of an office but does not morally qualify him in law without appointment thereto Our Redeemer did not run unsentbut  was called of God as was  Aaron  Hence we have frequently in the gospel his declaration "that the Father sent him" He demonstrated his divine mission by works that were truly miraculous and wonderfulTo these he appeals as a proof of his being sent of God  If I do not the works of my Father believe me not  John  x The Father which sent me he doth the work  John  xiv  CHRIST was called to his office by God in the most solemn man∣ner  The Lord hath sworn and will not repent  Thou art a priest for ever  Psal  cx  When CHRIST speaks of himself as the Good Shepherd he op∣poseth himself to such as came  unsent  whom he calls  thieves  and  robbers  It was because our Saviour was ap∣pointed to this office of surety that he had security for as∣sistance to support him in his work His mission and appointment were constantly before his eyes and upon this he founds his arguments in his prayer to the Father  I have finished the work thou gavest me to do therefore glorify thou me with that glory which I had with thee before the world was  John  xvii  Dr  Watts  Mr  Allen  and some others from this text would attempt to prove the preexistence of CHRIST's human soul But it does not seem that our Saviour's prayer refers to any glory he had in possession before the world but to what he had in promise As one of the  Elo∣him  or  Swearers  or  Covenanters  he had a promise made to him in that covenant of peace of aid and support in his suffering and of a glorious resurrection from the dead He had this glory promised him before the world began This was a glory he had with the Father to receive a right by promise of a glorious resurrectionSo his prayer here must refer to a promise he had in his eyefor the promise is the rule of the prayer of faith  The royal prophet personating JESUS CHRIST foretold what our Saviour here prays for  Psal  xvi  Thou wilt not leave my life or soul in the grave nor suffer thy holy One to see corruption  Which may be explained by  Luke  i  The holy Thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God  For the word  Psal  xvi is  Chesed  not  Kodesh  the word which in the Old Testament is used to signity the  Holy One of Israel  Our Redeemer had the glory to be a partner in the great transaction where man's redemption was settledand received a promise that his human nature should not sink under suffering nor be left to see corrup∣tionAnd he here says that the mu  ual glory of him and his Father was concerned in that work he was now about to engage in He puts up a prayer of faith for the accomplishment of that promise which con∣cerned both his Father's glory and his own  Glorify me with thine own self  intimating that the glory of both was concerned  i e  ful∣fil thy promise to me and make thy faithfulness appear conspicuous When the council of peace was between us both it was my glory to re∣ceive a promise of help and assistance and thine to make it Therefore glorify me with thine own self Here our SAVIOUR asks what he bare witness to when he bare record as one of the  Elohim  concerning the transaction of grace There seems no occasion of assuming any new hypothesis upon this subject when the truth may be accounted for with∣out any  HE could plead the law of his appointment and the oath that was made to him as the High Priest over the  house of God Without an appointment to his office and work there would have been no certainty that ever his work should have been acceptedBut as he was so∣lemnly appointed by the oath of JEHOVAH the law of the appointment secured to him acceptance whenever he should finish his work  CHAP III  The Effects of  CHRIST  's Redemption when it is mani∣fested to the Souls of Believers  SECT st  IT produceth an esteem of CHRIST and all things that are his When JESUS CHRIST makes himself known to his people as a Redeemer and displays the glory of his Redemption unto them the amiableness of his person and the greatness of the salvation he hath procured by his blood quite subdues their hearts and gains their esteem Such as saw no comeliness in him why he should be de∣siredwhile under the power of ignorance and the in∣fluence of error become by the manifestation of his ex∣cellencies altogether charmed with his beauty It is im∣possible but those who know this blessed object should esteem himbecause his excellencies are morally en∣gaging and have the power to transform the mind into a sameness of moral likeness with himself The Apostle who understood this subject better than most of men affirms it as a matter of certaintyThat  by beholding the glory of God through Jesus we are transformed into the same image from glory to glory  There are none who know the Redeemer but do love him and such as do not render him their supreme regard do testify that they know him not  THERE is something in the world which men call Knowledge which is only a  specious  resemblance of it yet is oftentimes mistaken for true understanding Thro' means of the gospel revelation men may come to  some  specious understanding of the character of JESUS CHRIST so as to enable them to speak  as if  they knew him But then their knowledge is no more than the wisdom of words This kind of knowledge may be called a passing view of CHRIST's character which may lead men to some speculation but can never be reduced to practice This sort of spurious knowledge is like that which we learn of the characters of men at court in the common news which may enable us to form conjectures concerning the leading draughts of  certain  reputations but being remote from the persons and the theatre on which they act we are uncertain of the justness of the various descriptions of character which may be given themBut true know∣ledge of JESUS CHRIST by the gospel is like that which we attain by friendly informationwhere the informer acts the part of a friendly instructorand knowing himself the things which he teacheth and describeth per∣fectly represents them with such evidence that our know∣ledge becomes certain and real  THE truths of the gospel to All who have not felt their power are only like the common news to a com∣mon readerwhich may learn him to speak but does not afford any certain knowledge nor make him any wiser Yet a stranger would perhaps not know the differ∣ence between such persons and men of more wisdom if he only heard them speak It is action  hich testifies the truth of true knowledgehe who pretends to know but is not truly instructed exposeth his own ignorance when brought to trial Christians who are really instructed in the knowledge of the gospel and understand the character of JESUS CHRIST are enabled according to their mea∣sure to act his character as a pattern of holiness their lives and that of CHRIST are as like one another in the leading parts of character as the image of babes and perfect men are like one another It is a saying common enough with regard to some persons that it is not for want of knowledge in religion that they do not live as becomes the gospel This is not true in fact if we con∣sider the word Knowledge in a strict senseWhenever any person knows JESUS CHRIST rightly it transforms him into his likeness and disposeth him to walk as he  also walked The knowledge of things in which men are not much interested may be attained without producing any visible alteration in their conductnor would men judge fairly of their understanding if they should con∣clude them ignorant of what they did not practise when neither  pleasure  nor  happiness  are connected with such practiceThe knowledge of things indifferent may be obtained without any visible evidence in action for being indifferent the practice upon knowing them is not absolutely necessary But to walk as CHRIST also walked and to imitate him as the blessed pattern of ho∣liness and perfection is absolutely necessary to happiness in this life or that which is to come  WHEN the excellencies of CHRIST are made known to the souls of men the connection between an imitation of them and everlasting happiness is also made known and the very power of that knowledge inclines the minds of christians to observe the imitation  Psal  ix  They that know thy name will put their trust in thee  He that loveth not knoweth not God    John  iv  The Apostle points out the connection between true knowledge of CHRIST and the work and labour of love    John  ii  He that saith I know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him ver He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now He that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is no occasion of stumbling in him But he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whither he go∣eth because that darkness hath blinded his eyes  Those who know God hear and obey what the Apostles of CHRIST hath saidbut whoever form their religious practice upon any other plan testify that they know not Godeven suppose they should make a great shew of Godliness in willworshipLet the Apostle  John  deter∣mine this point    John  iv  We are of God He that knoweth God heareth us he that is not of God heareth not usHereby we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error Beloved let us love one ano∣ther For love is of God and every one that loveth  is born of God and knoweth God  The reason why men do not esteem JESUS CHRIST and all things that are his is because they know him not  Luke  gives this for the reason in the  Acts  of the Apostles why the  Jews  condemned and crucified JESUS CHRIST because they knew him not  Acts  xiii  For they that dwell at Jerusalem because they knew him not nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath day they have fulfilled them in condemning him  WHEREVER JESUS CHRIST makes a true and real dis∣covery of his own Character and Redemption to the souls of men by his gospelso as the discovery becomes the materials of knowledge or rather knowledge itself it as necessarily begets esteem of JESUS as any active principle produceth its  proper  effects It becomes a part of a be∣liever's moral constitution and operates in the soul as a principle of actionAnd this knowledge expresseth it∣self in the way of esteeming CHRIST and all that is his Such as do not esteem our Redeemer it is because they do not know himThey have not the full conviction of his excellence fitness and sufficiency  I KNOW it has been often said that men may have the knowledge and full conviction of the truth and yet not be truely reformed therebyThis I cannot so easily understandFor our Saviour tells us that such as know the truth are set at liberty  Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free  John  viii  Wherever the scripture speaks of wicked men knowing God it must be understood comparatively with others who are more ignorant of the things which they are said to know A servant may know his master's will and not do it  i e  the things which he knoweth may be what his master requireth but still he does not know as he ought to knowand it is called knowledge in contrast to other men's total ignorance As long as men are not reformed in their hearts and lives they cannot properly be said to be convinced of truthnor accounted such who know JESUS CHRISTand it is their ignorance which keep∣eth them in bondage to Satan  THEY have such wisdom which passeth for true know∣ledge in the world and which may make a very specious appearance and deceive menbut it never proves its efficacy by that labour of love and esteem of JESUS CHRIST which true knowledge produceth in them who have it What  Solomon  says of wisdom may be strictly said of knowledge  It giveth life to them who have it  What has made men fall into a mistake in thinking that themselves or others have been possessed of true knowledge when they have been really ignorant of truth is their not considering the difference between tran∣sient views and solid understanding There are many transient and passing views which persons may have of objects which cannot justly be called true knowledge In objects of senfe they may be called glancesin objects of moral truth they may be called hintsin matters of fact or testimony they may be called notices Men may have some glances of a figure whose properties they do not understand and suppose they had a passing view of it yet they do not understand the form nor use of it without instructionA moral truth may be represented to our mind by some hints but is either removed before we un∣derstand it or the mind parts with it before it knows it Matters of fact may be brought to our hearing upon a credible enough testimony which may give notice of very surprising or profitable thingsbut the notices may either be short and imperfect or not often enough repeat∣ed to leave an impression of the truth of the facts and the authority of the author upon our mindsand in this re∣spect is not true knowledge This is something like a tale that is toldwhich though it may afford for the time some entertainment is not competent to be reduced into practice  THOSE three kinds of passing views may be illustrated by these similitudesThe first is like one who views his face in a glass but forgets what manner of man he wasThe second is like one who receives the dictates of a master upon a subject the rudiments of which he hath never learnedso has no knowledge of but as far as any thing he hath heard said is agreeable with some∣thing  he has already learnedThe latter is like one who receives the news from another who passeth by but is not able to form a judgment of what is reportedbecause he has not time to be acquainted with the author who re∣ports the facts That knowledge which superficial en∣quirers have in matters of religion is like the two last forts of knowledge Things marvelous may transiently be pointed out to themand alarming facts may be told them which may surprize themor create a sudden transport of wonder or fear according to the nature of the things intimatedBut what so suddenly struck them may as quickly be removed so that it never be∣comes a principle of action in their hearts nor leaves any just or lasting impression upon their mindsThis nei∣ther affords a sufficient information to the judgment nor produceth a full conviction in the conscience of the truth of what is reported It is only a transient passing view of truth but not the knowledge thereof The knowledge of JESUS CHRIST consists in the understanding of the character of him that speakethwhen he makes the report the matter of knowledge in the soul he maketh it shew his own veracity and a believer is instructed as well in the character of the person who reveals the truth as in the report he makes  THE gospel has this excellency above all other re∣portsThat it is calculated to make known the charac∣ter and veracity of him who publisheth it and sheweth with the surest evidence who he is that is the author of it We have no proof but what the gospel itself contains that God is the author of itnor have we any certain evidence to satisfy us that we are not imposed upon but what is expressed in the very testimony we believe Who∣ever believes the gospel is firmly persuaded at once that it is God that speaks and his word they believe The first true knowledge of God comes by the gospeland it is calculated to produce it It is much better contrived to make us understand what God is and what are his at∣tributes than all his works put together for it gives light "The entrance of thy word giveth light" Divine re∣velation is too often considered as a  sort  of passive organ something like the sun moon and stars which are said  to declare the Glory of Godand there are several people in the world will with difficulty admit that we can know it to be from God till we learn it  extra seipsum  without itselfBut the difficulty here is insurmount∣able and ends in  Atheism  For when men depart from scripture itself to seek for the knowledge of its author where do they land In eternal doubts and scepticism  By faith we understand that the worlds were made by the word of God  By the knowledge of the sacred records we learn the character of their author and re∣ceive the certain proof that God made the worldBut when we begin to seek the Divine Character among his works at first hand on purpose to settle the character of scripture we are obliged first to prove that the universe is his handy workThis is still more difficult to prove without help from the scripture than to find the charac∣ter of the author of revelation without such aid The gospel seems to be suited to some capacity in us whereby it produceth in our minds an assent to its truth by making known its author  THIS knowledge is not like opinion which is found∣ed upon probability nor like conjecture which is ground∣ed only on some probable marks of truthbut is founded upon certain understanding of facts concerning which there can be no reasonable doubt and on the testimony of one who neither will nor can deceive us  WHEN this knowledge is obtained it is not like opinion which may vary with probability but it becomes a principle of action in the mindand in its nature varies no more than the record on which it is founded It may have degrees according to the measure of divine manifestationbut as to its nature it is founded upon principles that are invariable It may increase or decline upon occasions but can never totally fail more than its first principles can be destroyed It is compared  to the shining light which shineth more and more unto the perfect day  This knowledge begets a lasting esteem of CHRIST on account of his many excellencies that are the sum of that heavenly wisdom  FROM the divine records the christian is informed that the Redeemer is a divine person  Fairer than the sons of men and more excellent than all mountains of prey  That he excells in wisdom power goodness and truthbut rests in his love and rejoiceth in mer∣cy Those who know JESUS CHRIST consider him not only as mighty to save but as the most excellent object of contemplation and delighthaving in him every beauty which can give pleasure to the mind It was from a certain knowledge of  this  that  David  expressed himself so earnest∣ly in these pathetic lines  Psal  xxvii  One thing have I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after that all the days of my life I may dwell in the house of the Lord to behold his beauty and enquire in his temple  The christian's esteem of JESUS is founded upon what is amiable in his characterwhat is not more striking than it is sweet In this love and esteem are something distinct Love which is the desire of enjoy∣ment of any object that is agreeable considered at some distance is more engaged with what is striking than what is amiablebut when the object is obtained and all the striking parts of character appear mixed with sweetness and amiablenessthen love rests in the object and becomes lasting esteem  WHEN a miserable sinner under the apprehensions of guilt and the Divine displeasure receives the intimation of the Redeemer's character as one who hath paid his ran∣som and hath delivered him from going down to the pit he is ready to be enamoured with his love and com∣passionand admires him rather as one who hath done him a real service than one who is intrinsickly worthy of his highest regardbut when he comes to consider his character more strictly after his surprize at his mercy is somewhat abated he comes to see that his chief happiness lies in being joined in fellowship with one who in all re∣spects is so engaging that his soul will never need any thing more to satisfy its desires through an endless tract of duration When CHRIST and his redemption is ma∣nifested in the soul the mind rests in the esteem of him who is worthy of its most exalted regards  BUT this knowledge makes christians also esteem all that is CHRIST'sEvery appointment of his and every ordinance which bears the stamp of his authority are dear to them who know himHis character as a Lawgiver who rules in mount Zion is the object of their esteem and therefore all his laws appear righteous It is not how agreeable some ordinances are to flesh and blood or how they may suit the ends of worldly policy and temporal in∣terest that engageth a christian to observe thembut whether they have the seal of CHRIST's appointment add∣ed to them The knowledge of CHRIST our Redeemer teacheth all his children to consider obedience to him in observing his ordinances not as means which merely lead to glorybut a very part of glory  itself  for it is their glory to keep his commandments in every stage of existence whatsoever The children of heavenly wisdom wisely consider that there is no difference between the militant state of CHRIST's church and that of the tri∣umphant with respect to men's obligation to obey him nor will they ever have any desire to be freed from his serviceAnd therefore they consider these ordinances which are appointed to them in this life to observe as the only heavenly exercise they are capable of for the present  THOSE who know JESUS CHRIST their Redeemer are not taken with the splendour of rituals nor engaged with the pompous means of devotionbut are more concerned about the spirit and truth of religion than the elegance of external modes of worship When they come to the house of God  they are more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools  The vocal praise of christian worship gives them more pleasurebecause they can mutually join in that devotion than all the symphany of instrumental music The  Jewish  sound of Organs Symbols and Harps give no delight to a christian's ear because CHRIST has not commanded that mode of praise in the New Testament sanctuary Such as know CHRIST crucified chuse to direct their devotion by some express laws of his authorising and will not venture to perform his service according to their own will and pleasure  They esteem all his precepts and promisesthey say of his commandments that in all things they are right Every promise is the object of a believer's trust and confi∣denceand what their Lord says they are able to re∣ceive as faithful sayingsBecause they know the ve∣racity of the author they chearfully trust his promise Though many circumstances in providence may intervene seemingly unfavourable to the accomplishment of God's promise yet the knowledge they have of the Divine cha∣racter supports their confidence under every unfavourable circumstanceBeing satisfied concerning God's love towards them by his giving his son they conclude that with him he will freely give them all things  MOREOVER they who have been favoured with the discovery of CHRIST's character as their Redeemer will love all the children of their heavenly fatherfor as they esteem him that begat they will also love them that are begotten This esteem is of the same kind towards all those who receive the truth in the love thereof and who bear the image of their heavenly fatherAnd tho' the children of God may differ in their moral stature or have different views of some thingsThough they may have different gifts and various imperfections in this present stateyet they esteem one another on account of their common relation to the one Father in JESUS CHRIST Difference in outward circumstance or variance in opi∣nion will not alter their opinion of one anotherwhile they agree in the original principles of knowledge namely the knowledge of CHRIST crucified Whenever men begin to disesteem one another and instead of loving one another do most heartily hate each other there is rea∣son to fear something worse than difference in opinion Nothing but total ignorance of JESUS CHRIST will pro∣duce such a dismal effect Men's opinions are what they cannot help more than they can add a cubit to their sta∣tureand if we think them wrong we ought to pity them but not hate them Christian love begets compassion for a brother when he errs and will not suffer the mind to re∣move its regards for what is only his misfortune  SECT d  IT produceth peace and tranquillity of mind When christians have attained to the true knowledge of CHRIST and the Redemption he hath obtained for them they re∣ceive full satisfaction concerning their peace with God through himand are persuaded they shall not be brought into condemnation or in the language of the  Psalmist  They shall not die but live and discover the works of the Lord  This occasions an inward cafe and satis∣faction of soulbecause God who is the chief good and whose anger is most to be dreaded is now reconciled through the blood of JESUS to the guilty  WHEN this great privilege is obtained the children of heavenly wisdom find no occasion to be troubled with what passes in the worldfor this reason be they poor or rich weak or strong as to the things pertaining to this life they are content because their treasure is in heaven Satisfaction concerning peace with our Maker not only makes us easy ourselves but makes us behave easily towards others with whom we may be concerned It does not appear that persons who behave with severity towards their fellow man have any pleasure in contemplating the Divine characterfor all severity proceeds from a sour∣ness of mind which the love of God subdues wherever it prevails When men called christians through a cruel∣ty of disposition endeavour to hurt one another for conscience sake it argues they have but bad consciences For if their consciences were purified they would endea∣vour to follow peace with all men All true peace of mind arises from satisfaction with those things that are the object of moral contemplation There are two things especially which fall under this denominationthe relations we stand in to Godand the happiness or misery that arise to us from those relations When these appear favourable to us they make us happy when we contemplate them if unfavourable they make us un∣happy  WHEN upon enquiry it is found that the character  of God appears opposite to what we find to be our own present leading character it must produce a very great uneasiness in the mind and make us unhappy If we find that God stands in the relation of a just and righteous judge to us and we in the relation of guilty sinners it will cause no little pain and uneasiness if we be not quite past feelingBut if it is found that he is related to us as a gracious and reconciled God thro' JESUS CHRIST bestowing pardon freely upon the guilty it will produce peace and satisfaction in the soul Our happiness and misery entirely depend upon what relation we stand in to God and he to us To consider him as a just Judge without perceiving his character as reconciled through his beloved Son sets before us a very awful prospect for in that character he condemns the guiltyBut when he is considered as the LORD GOD merciful and gracious in JESUS CHRIST he is represented as just and yet the justifier of the ungodly When this great point of peace with God is obtained and the intimation of it made to the conscience contentment with every o∣ther circumstance of life will be the necessary consequence this will dispose men to live peaceably as far as in them lies with every one It argues a bad conscience and corrupt heart to have a constant disposition to quarrel with others about things that are no ways momentous When we consider the connection of what has been said we shall not be able to give any other reason for men fall∣ing out with their fellow christians and brethren but that they know not JESUS CHRIST and are at variance with their Makerfor were they in good terms with the Almighty they would find no great difficulty to live peaceably with all menAnd we may easily learn from observation that a good man is not at so much difficulty to live peaceably with his enemies as bad men and hypo∣crites are to live in peace with their most intimate friends Whoever is fully persuaded of what JESUS hath done for them will not grudge to seek peace with their very foes they know they cannot follow a better example than that of CHRIST The various murmurings which pre∣vail among nominal professors of religion only testify how little they are acquainted with that Saviour who died to  make peace for men and shed his precious blood to ob∣tain for them forgiveness of sin  THERE are many more effects which the manifestation of CHRIST and Redemption through him produce in the souls of those who believe the record concerning him which I am obliged to leave out of this Essay lest I should swell it to an undue sizeI shall therefore finish it with observing that our whole conversation will be directed according to our knowledge and belief of this subject Wherever it prevails as an article of religion in truth it will dispose the believers to walk as CHRIST also walked It is one of those doctrines of grace that purify the heart and animates the whole conduct of christiansInfidelity in this particular will not long lie concealedfor as a man thinketh so is heand he will shew the abundance of his heart by the manner of his actingBut all who believe in CHRIST will be careful to maintain good works  FINIS
