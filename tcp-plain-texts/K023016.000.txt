 THE CHARACTER OF  KATHARINE  LATE Duchess of  Buckinghamshire  and  Normanby  By the late Mr  POPE  LONDON Printed for M COOPER in  PaternosterRow  MDCCXLVI  THE CHARACTER OF  KATHARINE  LATE Duches of  Buckinghamshire  c c  _SHE was the Daughter of  James  the Second and of the Countess of  Dorchester  who inherited the Integrity and Virtue of her Father with happier Fortune She was married first to  James  Earl of  Anglesey  and secondly to  John Sheffield  Duke of  Buckinghamshire  and  Normanby  with the former She exercised the Virtues of  Patience and Suffering    as long as there was any Hopes of doing Good by either with the latter all other  Conjugal Virtues  The Man of finest Sense and sharpest Discernment She had the Happiness to please and in that found her only Pleasure When he died it seem'd as if his Spirit was only breathed into her to fulfill what he had begun to perform what he had concerted and to preserve and watch over what he had left  his only Son  in the Care of whose Health the forming of whose Mind and the Improvement of whose Fortune She acted with the Conduct and Sense of the  Father  soften'd but not overcome with the Tenderness of the  Mother  Her Understanding was such as must have made a Figure had it been in a Man but the Modesty of her Sex threw a Veil over its Lustre which nevertheless suppress'd only the Expression not the Exertion of it for her Sense was not superior to her Resolution which when once She was in the Right preserv'd her from making it only a Transition to the Wrong the frequent Weakness even of the best Women She often followed wise Counsel but sometimes went before it always with Success She was possess'd of a Spirit which assisted her to get the better of those Accidents which admitted of any Redress and enabled her to support outwardly with Decency  and Dignity those which admitted of none yet melted inwardly through almost her whole Life at a Succession of melancholy and affecting Objects the Loss of all her Children the Misfortunes of  Relations and Friends    publick and private  and the Death of those who were dearest to her Her Heart was as compassionate as it was great Her Affections warm even to Sollicitude Her Friendship not violent or jealous but rational and persevering Her Gratitude equal and constant to the Living to the Dead boundless and heroical What Person soever She found worthy of her Esteem She wou'd not give up for any Power on Earth and the greatest on Earth whom She cou'd not Esteem obtain'd from her no farther Tribute than Decency Her GoodWill was wholly directed by Merit not by Accident not measured by the Regard they profess'd for her own Desert but by her Idea of theirs And as there was no Merit which She was not able to imitate there was none which She cou'd envy therefore her Conversation was as free from Detraction as her Opinions from Prejudice or Prepossession As her Thoughts were her own so were her Words and She was as sincere in uttering her Judgment as impartial in forming it She was a safe Companion many were serv'd  none ever suffer'd by her Acquaintance Inoffensive when unprovok'd when provok'd not stupid But the Moment her Enemy ceased to be hurtful She could cease to act as an Enemy She was therefore not a bitter but consistent Enemy tho' indeed when forced to be so the more a finish'd One for having been long a making And her Proceeding with ill People was more in a calm and steady Course like Justice than in quick and passionate Onsets like Revenge As for those of whom She only thought ill She considered them not so much as once to wish them ill of such her Contempt was great enough to put a Stop to all other Passions that could hurt them Her Love and Aversion her Gratitude and Resentment her Esteem and Neglect were equally open and strong and alterable only from the Alteration of the Persons who created them Her Mind was too noble to be insincere and her Heart too honest to stand in Need of it so that She never found Cause to repent her Conduct either to a Friend or an Enemy There remains only to speak of her Person which was most amiably Majestick the nicest Eye could find no Fault in the Outward Lineaments of her Face or Proportion of her Body it was such as pleas'd wherever she had a Desire it shou'd yet she never envy'd that of any other  which might better please in general In the same Manner as being content that her Merits were esteemed where She desired they should She never depreciated those of any other that were esteemed or prefered elsewhere For She aimed not at a general Love or a general Esteem where She was not known it was enough to be possess'd of both wherever she was Having lived to the Age of Sixtytwo Years not courting Regard but receiving it from all who knew her not loving Business but discharging it fully wheresoever Duty or Friendship engaged her in it not following Greatness but not declining to pay Respect as far as was due from Independency and Disinterest having honourably absolv'd all the Parts of Life She forsook this World where She had left no Act of Duty or Virtue undone for that where alone such Acts are rewarded on the th Day of  March    The above Character was written by Mr  Pope  some Years before Her Grace's Death
