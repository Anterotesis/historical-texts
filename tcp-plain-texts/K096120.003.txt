DCC LXXXVIII  TRAVELS THROUGH Siberia and Tartary PROVINCES OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE  By S PALLAS M D PROFESSOR OF NATURAL HISTORY c  PART I CONTINUED  IN my way from Kalmykowa on the th of  August  to the next station on the line I met with a number of tarantulas which every Cossack was ac∣quainted with and one and all declared that their bite was harmless Not many miles distant on a tract of the high shore of the river Jaik before we reached the heights of the Inderskoian mountains which ex∣tend themselves to the river we saw almost every  where large flocks of antelopes feeding which as the wind was in our faces did not fly before us the sight of this animal being imperfect or rendered obscure by four spungy excrescencies on the eye nature how∣ever has favoured them in the organs of smell and made them much superior to other animals in it's quick∣ness and extent for they will scent a man or animal if the wind is favourable at two or three miles distance Yet it is wonderful that the antelopes which seem to be constructed for swift running having windpipes almost two inches in diameter large lungs and wide skinny nostrils should be soon out of breath more so than any other animal This I have often observed in tame ones which have neither been scared or alarmed The Inderskoian mountains which are full of stucco are always crowded with them till the Kirguese make their appearance who hunt them incessantly This ani∣mal is very fond of the small white wormwood which grows here in abundance They were now so nu∣merous that the little escort which attended me shot above twelve of different ages We saw here also in quantities a peculiar species of uncommonly beautiful lizards running about in the sun and a number of racehares and marmots  In a salt district situated upon the heights of Tschornoijar about miles from the Wolga where there is not only a strong saltlake but also stonesalt and again about thirty miles east of it are two  clests in the mountains which the Kalmucks hold as sacred as do the Kirguese the Jlezkian mountain and offer to them as vows harness arms and other things and give this fictitious story as a reason for their so do∣ing that their DelaiLama had once passed a night on one and dined upon the other In the cleft of one is said to be some water and the Kalmucks say that one of their countrymen having once fallen into it came out again in the Wolga safe and unhurt  The Inderskoi mountains are so full of salt that the Cossacks who set out in spring to fetch salt from this place take as much freshwater with them as they think they shall have occasion for there being no freshwater springs  I no sooner reached the top of this mountain than I was struck with a large lake resembling an extensive plain glittering with snow and encompassed with heights which on a calculation I made is above the level of the river Jaik This lake may be justly called a wonder of nature It lies in a straight line scarcely seven miles from the Jaik about miles south from JaizkoiGorodok I could not determine it's extent but the Cossacks say it is sixty miles round it is ap∣parently about ten miles in circumference It wears a round form and has many bays The water is not very deep for I rode into it near a quarter of mile and was not up to the girths of my saddle The water of  this lake is so saturated with salt that large cubic grains are constantly forming upon the shore when not prevented by moist weather and it's borders seem to be sowed with salt From the constant evaporation of this lake the land all round is covered with a crust of salt seven inches thick This crust is as hard as stone of a pure white and when broke ex∣hibits an extraordinary chrystalization in irregular bo∣dies Underneath this crust lies a gravelly grey and loose salt which may be easily pierced I ran a Cos∣sack lance which was ten feet long down into it without finding any bottom of course to what depth this salt lies cannot be determined This is the salt which the Cossacks gather being small and fit for use loading their little waggons in the lake itself They wash it with saltwater on the spot till it loses it grey colour I dare not venture a supposition respecting the formation of this loose salt I must also confess my ignorance about the origin of that fine white cubic salt called by the Cossacks  Tamosa Kaja Sol  It resembles small and large hail promiscously scattered on the muddy shore and touching the ground only in one point The largest cubes were about the size of a small walnut the chief no larger than peas and many not so large as the smallest hail Their whiteness is dazzling to the eye and they are so solid that it was with difficulty I could squeeze them between my thumb and finger Their substance seems to be a sort of ala∣basterlike stone the parts of which are almost invisible  with a magnifying glass I could not discover any chrystalline configuration This salt keeps itself very dry and notwithstanding it's soft consistency dissolves slower in water than stonesalt If you pour into the saltwater a dissolved alkali it milks very much but if suffered to steam away by boiling without any mixture it has the appearance and quality of kitchensalt though adhering much in crusts about the vessel in which it is boiled This generation of cubicsalt is only found after a long drowth accompanied by storms When I was at the lake on the th of August it was plentifully to be met with but on my return to it in September some tempestuous rains had swept it quite away From these circumstances it may be con∣cluded that the cubic pieces of salt are formed by some attractive power from the particles of salt evapo∣rated from the lake  This mountain is full of a variety of minerals coals stucco allum marcasites belemnites oystershells c The Cossacks pick up these shells and prepare them as a medicine for children against acidities pouring water into the shell and scraping off some of it's inside substance with a knife They sup∣pose that where a flash lightning falls such a shell will grow in the space of three years after The Kal∣mucks fetch also from this place a kind of deepred marle in dust of which there are whole hills on this  mountain and with which they paint their tentpoles red  Of the vegetable kingdom this mountain boasts of the bushy orach  Atriplex Glauca  the pretty saltwort  Salicornia Arabica  and another species of this plant not yet discovered by botanists  Salicornia Strobilacea  The latter grows on the low and moist part of the borders of the saltlake and both the for∣mer on the higher Besides these the thorny glasswort and  Salsola arbuscula  also the thrift  Statice Suffruticosa  As to the animal kingdom I could have gathered plenty of insects from the flat borders of the lake brought here by storms on it's wide waters washed a∣shore dead and perfectly preserved by the saltwater Among them were several rare species peculiar to the hotter parts of Asia the large wandering grasshop∣per a smaller species  Gryllus Italicus  the scorpionspider  Phalangium Araneoides  and many more  On the st of August I continued my journey along the line to the next station and met in my way with a plant which the Kalmucks drink as tea At Kula∣ginaGorodok a little fort on an arm of the Jaik more spacious indeed than the fort Kalmykowa but not better built though it has a church and a garrison of Kalmuck and Tartar soldiers under an ataman  who commands the whole line but who is himself subordinate to the commander of Gurjef Some of the Tartars have here watermelon gardens where this fruit thrives uncommonly well and from whence they supply other stations who are in want of this producti∣on Among the Kalmucks lived a Sungorian priest or gellung who had ten scholars  Mandschi  His bur∣chans were Ajuscha Dshakdschimmuni and another figure resembling the former which was holding his hands across before him having in the right the sa∣cerdotal sceptre and in the left the bell he called him  Odschirrdarr  All were neatly cast in copper and strongly gilt I will give my readers two other Kal∣muck stories which may serve as proofs of their aus∣pices  I have already mentioned that the white owl is much looked up to and considered as a sacred prophesying bird To the flamingo  Phoenicopterus ruber  known in Russia by the name of  krasna  or red goose they shew an absurd antipathy whilst they almost make a burchan of the other They believe the latter to be possessed of an evil spirit look upon it as a bird omi∣nous of ill turn away their faces from it and load it with imprecations but of the red duck which is also a sacred bird they say it is the purest of all the winged tribe The crane is also held to be one of the purest of birds and is therefore never killed  Near Kulagina is a piece of Russian antiquity worth notice It is a considerable intrenchment known to the Cossacks by the name of MarinkinGorodok Marinka it is said was a woman who in former times committed robberies from this place Nothing is more probable than that it owes it's fortification and name to Marina of Senomir spouse to one of the false Demetriuses MarinkinGorodok lies about a mile northeast of Kulagina where the Jaik once had it's course though now at the distance of threequarters of a mile The intrenchment represents a direct angle with oblique sides from one end of the intrenchment to the other it is paces Within the intrenchment are here and there turfhills arising from subterra∣neous habitations which the Cossacks affirm to be there  Before I quit this place permit me to mention the condition of a patient afflicted with the leprosy a youth of twentyFrom his infancy he was always said to be of an infirm constitution but never had any distemper till the age of fifteen at that period two red blotches were observed upon his face as broad as two thumbs He continued however in good spirits and the blotches disappeared before the year had elaps∣ed In the second year came forth by degrees over his whole body reddish and blue spots accompanied by a density of skin with which he was afflicted when I saw him With the leprosy he felt a weakness in all his  limbs and a smart pain in the joints This weakness and pain frequently attacked him to such a degree that he was unable to move either hand or foot yet his joints were not the least swelled He was once blood∣ed and his blood was thick and of a highred colour The pains were not always equally violent but remit∣ted for some days and were easier rubbing the joints with oil of turpentine relieved him In the third year his mouth and throat became full of little boils which affected his voice and made him as it were short∣breathed He had also a continual cough and dry∣ness of mouth Even before the leprosy he seemed to have the itch and it continued with it Notwith∣standing this disorder he had a good appetite and when the cough and pains in his limbs did not prevent him performed his accustomed labour His urine was reddish but not unnatural He never experienced any inclination to venery the palms of his hands and soles of his feet were free from the leprosy but the skin hardened and peeled off from them to remedy this they were often anointed with fishfat The cause or the distemper is unknown but several of his mother's relations are said to have been afflicted with the same His parents never refused to attend him they did not drink out of the same vessels but lived with him went into the same bath and never experienced the least of the disorder  In my way to Gurjef I took notice of the caper∣bean  Zygophyllum fabago  which is in that salt quar∣ter a common weed and in great plenty It was now the d of August full of ripe seeds of which they make capers about Astrachan As it was quite decay∣ed I could not determine it's species so far I could gather that it belongs to the starflowers  Compositi∣florae  and it's leaves are of middle size like those of purslain It grows up with straight and branching stalks about an ell high and bears flowers on the point which are said to be blue The calix seems like that of the hawkweed  Hieracium  and the seeds hairy  pappus pilosus sessilis  Near the station Saratschik on the eastern side of the river Jaik are the ruins of a mausoleum and the remains of a Tartarian town probably the asylum of a Tartarian horde which time has obliterated The bulwark and ditch is still to be seen and appears to be from three to four miles in circumference In the middle of this area is a canal which served as an a∣queduct Within the bulwark are many traces foun∣dations and vaults of brickbuildings which shew that in the middle of the town must have stood some consi∣derable edifices The bricks are oblong and tolerably large there are also some pieces of brown stones with impressions of shells no where else to be seen in this neighbourhood likewise broken pieces of chinavessels some white some a beautiful yellow and high∣ly  glazed As the whole soil of this town is extremely wet and salt all the ironwork which has been found is so much covered with rust as scarcely to be known what it is It is the same with the copper and silver found the copper almost consumed with verdigrease and the silver changed almost to the innermost part of the metal I saw there in some of the Cossack houses several coralbeads of divers colours some little ground and polished topazes and some stones like cornelian The sepulchres made here are of brick and often little articles of value have been found in them  In this place also was a leprous Cossack about forty years of age who had been six years afflicted with this disorder His first symptom of leprosy was a large highred spot upon his forehead which present∣ly disappeared soon after his body became red all over with terrible blue spots which made his skin so painful that he could not bear it to be touched Even this disappeared in six months After this he felt by degrees a pain but without any swelling in his arms and hands which are now so much withered as to be useless During the ensuing years he felt the most violent pain in his legs and feet his legs swelled and the skin became thick and hard but he never had any ulcers in his mouth or throat After some time the spots disappeared again and have not broke out since Other matters were as I described in the boy This  man had a relation who died of this disorder yet no one is afraid to nurse him or be about him They all take care however not to eat or drink out of his ves∣sels The livid colour in his face and swelled appear∣ances began with the disorder and continued till I saw him  On the d of August I reached the newerected redoubt of Gurjef The Jaik here winds and bends so much that it would be difficult to represent it on a map and after all one's trouble it might be looked on as questionable and unauthentic particular∣ly as the stream so often changes by inundations in the spring The whole district is a saltmine and in sum∣mer the flies are insupportable I do not know a more suitable punishment for malefactors than to trans∣port them here and make them burn ashes of the saltplants Since I have been out I never spent so disa∣greeable a day as in this redoubt waiting for a carri∣age Among other saltplants I found the two fol∣lowing new ones  Polycnenum oppositifolium  and  Salicor∣nia foliata  and a species of fly that crowded the air and tortured us exceedingly met with about the Cas∣pian sea but new and unknown in Europe  On the d arrived from Gurjef two boats with Mr  Lepechin  whom I met here but a south west wind which continued all this day and the next prevented my departure for Gurjef till the th  in the afternoon for it was impossible to cross the Jaik on horseback there being no bridges I went therefore by water and by this means avoided the flies and other vermin The road to Gurjef by land does not exceed fifteen miles but by water it was near thirty We reached Gurjef about two o'clock in the morning where I found Professor  Lowitz  busy in his astronomical observatory Gurjef was now the ren∣dezvous of scientific pilgrims for besides Professor  Lowitz  his Assistant  Inochodzof  was there and Lieuten∣ant  Euler  We could not have chosen a more disa∣greeable place for this purpose but the hospitality of the commandant Brigadier  de Vegesak  and his social disposition put us at our ease and made it pleasant  Gurjef though small is about seven miles from the mouth of the Jaik which empties itself into the Caspi∣on sea is one of the most regular and wellbuilt little forts about the river Jaik it's works consist of a strong square brickwall with bastions on it's angles The place has but one gate facing the river which flows near it Except the house of the commandingofficer there is scarce a good habitation in the place The church like the houses is built of wood except the powdermagazine which is of stone The garrison consists of a company of infantry and sixty Cossacks and here live a few merchants from Astrachan The place might become flourishing if they would encou∣rage a trade with the Kirguese and the situation itself  was not so unwholesome The few merchants here carry on a lucrative commerce with the Kirguese but it might be rendered far more considerable There is scarce so unhealthy a place to be met with from spring to autumn The fort lies in the middle of a salt∣marsh mostly overflown in spring by seawater driven by the southern winds into the mouth of the Jaik Within the fort they have raised the ground by art yet the whole is so salt and loamy that it is never dry of course we breathe constantly a soul air rendred stinking by seamud even though the weather is stor∣my Within doors one is covered with woodlice and tarakans and as soon as we leave the fort the oxflies  Tabanus bovmus et occidentalis  make their attack upon us in swarms It is no wonder that the inhabi∣tants sicken under such torments yet their disorders are not so general and mortal as one would suppose and the garrison bill of mortality for six years though they have no regular surgeon has been extremely small Incautious strangers generally pay the tribute of sick∣ness at first coming and the scurvy in the spring here is a universal complaint but the inhabitants cure themselves by the leaves of the rapontic and the roots of the reedmace  Typha  The saltness of the mires is to be attributed to those most remarkable saltdews which in summertime are common about Gurjef This to many will appear an incredible phenomenon but I am able to confirm  it's truth by many credible witnesses It would be no∣thing surprizing to find a saltdew upon flowers and plants in saltground as they commonly perspire a great quantity of salt but even the drops of dew that gather in the free air on smooth bodies and the moist∣ness which enters our cloaths have a considerable de∣gree of saltness Why then should it be surprizing that chemists by a reiterated dissolution and evapora∣tion of salt have found a certain diminution of the quantity and hence conclude that salt may be dissol∣ved into earth and water and apparently united with both I must also take notice that saltdew may be observed higher up the Jaik and undoubtedly the pernicious dews are of the same kind in other hot and sultry climates  It appears that the saltness of the soil round Gurjef ought not solely to be ascribed to the seawater for it is only the detained water of the river that overflows this district and the Jaik near Gurjef is scarce per∣ceptibly salt though the seawinds blow Besides a little stucco rock lying not above a mile and a half from Gurjef westward to every one's surprize in a low and miry ground seems a confirmation of these re∣marks to indicate some hidden salt and which may also be concluded from the strong saltness of the wa∣ter which collects itself in holes made in this ground The stucco here as mostly on the Inderskoian moun∣tains is of the nature of selenites and from this little  hill situated between Tschernaja Retschka and an arm of the Jaik runs a bank of muscleshell ground to∣wards the sea The Kirguese hold this hill like those of Ilezkaja sacred They do not assemble here to ce∣lebrate feasts but believe that some saint is interred therein and therefore frequently there bury their dead  The supposition of concealed salt here is more rati∣onal from the saltlakes in the Kirguisian step on the opposite side of the river where the garrison of Gurjef may supply itself with salt gratis  Every species of fish found in the Jaik crowd all the bays here and also the lake but the privilege of the Jaikian Cossacks prohibits the garrison from fish∣ing with nets yet the soldiers have a method of catch∣ing plenty especially barbel in the shallows with a twospiked harpoon  All the sidewaters of the Jaik are full of frogs a∣mong these there is a huge species which is also found in the Wolga whose voice resembles the loud laugh of a man It might perhaps be of service to the French nation to send a colony of these frogs into the rivers of France for there is more flesh on the hind∣part of one Jaikian frog than ten common ones and they are equally as delicate The miry bottom of the Jaik breeds also a great many rivercrabs and they  are larger here than I remember to have any where seen yet empty lean and of a bad flavour and as the crabs of the Wolga when boiled are but of a palered those of the Jaik become only of a yellowgrey Here are also plenty of waterserpents  Coluber Hy∣drus et scutatus  and the common otter with red spots about his neck  There is here an undescribable quantity of wildfowl The bittern several species of searavens the least not less in size than a pidgeon the spoonbill heron brown red white and little white herons and every other kind nightravens among which is the large  Tantalus niger  the sealark  Hiaticula  in great abundance but the most curious bird they have is the longlegged plover  Himantopus  The yelper or Italian  avosetta Recurvirostra  several species of gulls  Larus cinerarius et naevius  also terns  Sterna hirundo naevia nigra  and among the birds of prey the following hawks  Falco Lanarius Pygargus acru∣ginosus et Nisus  among the small birds the rushthrush  turdus arundinaceus  and the titmouse  pa∣rus biarmicus  and quantities of all sorts of nightbirds In the fort itself are many large bats in such quantities under the roofs that we may hear them scream every where We meet also here with all kinds of owls particularly the churnowl  Caprimul∣gus  and the  strix pulchella  The cause of their abode here is an abundance of nocturnal insects which affords  them a rich subsistence Swans and flamingos  Phoe∣nicopterus  are only seen wandering in spring these birds are too shy to live here but in the more distant bays they are knocked down with cudgels at moult∣ing time by the Cossacks having no wing feathers to fly and protect themselves Here are also plenty of wildboars which the Cossacks hunt with hounds but not without danger and kill them with guns and lan∣ces These animals frequent the rushy districts live on rushroots and attain so prodigious a size that the males shall sometimes weigh above lb their co∣lour is a yellowishbrown but their heads and feet of an irongrey or black The bodies of the cubs are irongrey with yellowwhite spots and are so wild as scarcely to be tamed the fat of the wildboar is a hand deep but it wastes almost all away in boiling the flesh however is sound and has not the least taste of a wild ravenous animal  Otterhunting is a fine diversion in this country and catching of seadogs which sometimes come up the river from Astrachan Their heads and forefeet are so overgrown with fat that they resemble rather bottles of fishoil than animals A great deal of seadog oil is exported from Astrachan in the Russian trade and is used in the preparation of Russian hides about Casan With the addition of potash they make of it at As∣trachan a grey soap allowed to be incomparable for  cleaning of woolens It is sold in small soft flat cakes by the name of Astrachan or Tartarian soap  As to the vegetable kingdom we find about Gurjef the same kind of plants as are the natives of all salt soils One would scarcely suppose that on such a soil any kind of culinary herbs would grow but wee see the re∣verse The commandant has a garden in which grows well melons cucumbers for pickling beet horseradish colewort colerape parsley and it would bring forth tobacco celery cauliflowers potatoes and watermelons  I went down the river between the th and th of August to the Caspian sea which at the mouth of the Jaik is of a greygreen colour but further out sailors say it is of a blackgreen and that they often observe a phosphoric splendor in it's waves  In the Caspiansea fisheries the beljugastone which has always remained problematical is often found in the larger species of this fish and commonly sold at the cheap price of a few rubles According to fisher∣mens accounts this stone is always found in a sack of the  rectum  or fundamentgut through which the fish deposes it's excrement and spawn They are sometimes found also in the largest sorts of sturgeons I have known such stones weigh from one to three ounces they may with difficulty be scraped with a knife  Among the Russian domestic medicines the beljugastone is of great importance though it does not merit it It is given to expedite hard travail in disorders of children and obstructions of the urethra in small doses scraped and mixed with water They ascribe these and some other inconceivable virtues to a stone often found in the bladder of wildboars and sold dearer than that of the beljuga by the name of  Kabannoi Kamen  That the beljugastone is to be reckoned among ani∣malstones and should not be taken as an auricular bone or other natural parts of a fish is proved besides the confirmed situation in which it is found and their different shapes for sometimes they are quite oval and smooth and sometimes rough and sandy triangu∣lar and more or less flattened their colour is bonewhite and they are of a uniform texture  'The Caspian sea' says  Tooke  is at present no more than a great lake confined within the land but it is supposed formerly to have had a commu∣nication with the Euxinesea and to have spread over all those vast steps or desarts of the Jaik the Wol∣ga and the Kalmucks The multitude of shells scat∣tered over all these steps such shells as are found in the Caspian sea alone and are never to be met with in rivers the uniformity of soil in all the parts of these steps consisting with a very few exceptions of a pure sand the general saline quality of the soil that  continued equality of country and that universal want of wood c favour this opinion  Not to say something of the city of Astrachan when we are treating of places so near it would be unpardonable Dr  Pallas  did not visit this place himself but Mr  Gmelin  did in and he tells us that this city is situated in the midst of meadows that border the Wolga where the river divides into a number of branches about sixty miles from it's entrance into the Caspian sea and is built on seve∣ral hills that lie within the compass of it's walls It has a fortress the city is surrounded with walls con∣tains houses twentyfive Russian churches and two convents The Armenians have two churches the Lutherans one the Romancatholics one and the Indians have a small idoltemple It has a large metropolitical church built of brick an archiepiscopal palace and an archbishop Here is a large botanical garden and a chemical laboratory where they prepare salts extracted from plants the bitter salt of Astrachan the juice of liquorice distil∣led waters c Every Apothecary's shop through∣out the empire belongs to the crown and they ob∣tain from this place every medicinal plant they want the apothecary here established supplies all Russia with liquoricejuice and glauberssalts and being near Persia and of course able to procure curious simples from thence at a cheap rate he is  frequently ordered to supply the drugwarehouses with them at Petersburg and Moscow In one part of Astrachan is the imperial comptoir of the gar∣dens which contain above persons These fur∣nish the court of Petersburg with every kind of fruit and are now establishing vineyards  In the gardens of Astrachan grow all sorts of Eu∣ropean culinary herbs except the potatoe and the artichoke They plant a great quantity of pimento Pears apples cherries peaches and mulberrytrees thrive exceedingly well but as caterpillars destroy most of the blossoms they bear but little fruit They lay their vines underground allwinter and as the heats in summer are exceedingly sultry and showers rare gardens are watered by windmills which raise the water from running streams into trenches that run through the grounds and sufficiently refresh the plants without throwing it over them  This city having suffered prodigiously by a late fire the court of Petersburgh has ordered the bank to advance rubles for building brickhouses which the inhabitants were to be put in possession of on paying the net cost of the building The poor to be allowed ten years to pay the money but these buildings are carried on so slow that many generati∣ons will pass away before Astrachan is finished  I returned to Gurjef on the st and though we had a dreadful storm before us not a single drop of rain fell upon us As I went further on I found that the rain had fallen like a torrent and rendered the roads so bad that our horses and wheels sunk upon the saltspots so deep that we could not get them out for half an hour This violent rain had extended itself further than the Inderskoimountains for on the st of Sep∣tember I paid a second visit to the saltlake there It was at this time full of Kirguese either encamped or wandering about with their herds yet though I had an escort only of four Cossacks they behaved most friendly and sociably These guests had entirely dri∣ven away the antelopes whose arrival here is always considered as the approach of the Kirguese for they constantly fly before a Kirguisian encampment  On the d of September towards night I came to Antenowa in my way back to JaizkoiGorodok and the same moment as I left it arose a violent hot hurri∣cane called by the Tartars  Buran  from southwest and continued during the whole night The air was so close and sultry that we had almost lost respiration  De L'isles'  thermometer was the whole night at deg and after sunrise when the wind was abated at deg Such sultry storms rising from east and southeast especially in autumn in these districts are not rare and are looked upon as forerunners of heavy tempests We had just reached KoschaCharof on the  th at night as the air was calm and somewhat cooler when some dreadful tempestuous clouds from southeast gathered over us and broke in showers and unin∣terrupted flashes of lightning which rent the elements and continued for some seconds in form of fiery co∣lumns On this account we advanced but slowly At break of day September we reached Budarin and in the afternoon JaizkoiGorodok at the distance of miles  'These winds' says  Tooke  are as hot as if they proceeded from the mouth of a furnace they ge∣nerally rise about two o'clock in the afternoon and blow till after midnight During the time they blow sheep will often fall down dead in numbers the blood foams out at their mouths and they swell and putrify so fast that it is not possible to save their skins A wind of this sort was felt at Antibes in Provence in the year It happened during the greatest heat of summer which is well known to be very in∣tense in that country and the woods at a few leagues distance from the town having taken fire whereby more than a thousand acres were consumed it ap∣peared to those who were exposed to the wind as if scalding water was thrown over them The typhons of Egypt are of this kind  JaizkoiGorodok  The tempest I have just now men∣tioned put an end to the present summer and we had  not one perfectly agreeable day after it It was time therefore to go to Ufa where I designed to pass my winter but being desirous first of satisfying my curio∣sity by taking a view of some remarkable things in the stepmountains here I went after writing down my observations on the th to that mountainous district from whence springs the brook Derkul and flows more than fifteen miles above JaizkoiGorodok on the right into the Tschagan and I sent two students on before me to another brook  A mile or two from the town I passed the burialplace of the Tartarian Cossacks which is on one of the steps Here is a wooden house of prayer and many gravehills having at each southern end a pole Se∣veral such ancient burialplaces are to be met with be∣tween both Tschagans and the Jaik derived perhaps from the Nogayans that formerly resided here for they are not Kirguisian tombs  About eighteen miles from JaizkoiGorodok on a dry hillystep is a high tumulus Several Tartars were here encamped with their herds A saltplant which I had not yet seen was here in full bloom  As∣tragalus Cornutus  Whole flocks of bustards were here on the step and departing for warmer climes  On the th we saw many wild goats roving at some distance Towards night it began to rain and grew so  dark that I was obliged to spend the night in the mid∣dle of a step where we could scarcely gather as much brushwood and reed as was necessary to warm and dry ourselves On the th we returned to JaizkoiGo∣rodok during a continual rain Larks wild pidgeons and other wandering birds repaired in great numbers to the southern climates which foreboded an early winter  On the st of September I set out for Ufa but the day before I left JaizkoiGorodok a violent storm rose from the southeast and brought about night tre∣mendous thunder and such heavy rains as could only be compared to a spout so that within an hour the fields were covered with water six inches deep and in the course of the night the wind changed to the northeast and brought snow and frost so severe as to freeze the waters and make every place around us a scene of ice During this weather crowds of cranes and bus∣tards travelled downwards along the Jaik and vast flights of small birds a species of Ortolan and equal to ours in flavour  Emberizapasserina  ran about the roads without being the least shy  The village Kargalinskaja through which we passed not many miles from Orenburg is delightfully situated on the north and right bank of the Samara The houses which are mostly wellbuilt with stonefoundations and provided with airy rooms are in number and the  metsched or house of prayer is a fine and pleasing edi∣fice Most of the Tartars here settled are of Casanian origin but differ a little from the Casanians in their manners and customs and are a trading and substantial people It will not then be wondered at that they should study their persons and have a little Tartarian gallantry among them These people like our modern Turks clear away the hair from every part of their bodies with an ointment of lime and arsenick and the women in imitation of Oriental nations paint their eyes and nails The Tartarian ladies make use of a certain plant called  Kina  or  Kna  dry it and reduce it to powder which being mixed with allum and fresh goosedung they bind for one night over their nails and it gives them a yellowred colour which among our European beauties would surely as an ornament be rejected though it be an instance of Oriental taste Spanishpaste is an imitation of that used by the Tar∣tars and Moors for extirpating their hair  They grow a great deal of wheat about Kargalins∣kaja of which they make a fine flour notwithstanding the soil and situation is more unfavourable to this grain here than in some other places for according to far∣mers theory wheat will do well in very open countries where wood will not grow and here there is little else than birch and white poplars The country along the Samara is so rich with metalick ores that one cannot travel half a mile without seeing some mineral enclo∣sures  belonging to different manufactories at Oren∣burg  The badness of the weather and the snow which be∣gan to cover every part of the ground would not per∣mit me to make many useful observations I therefore passed Orenburg and made the best of my way to Ufa through many Baskirian villages and stations The Baskirs were now assembling themselves with their hordes about their winterquarters They differ from other nomades by living during the winter in huts built of wood in the Russian way Near these huts they lay stores of hay in high stacks round about trees to feed their cattle in case of necessity Most of their houses are very small and the room within is provided with wooden benches to sleep on The Baskirians have a chimney on the right hand of the door resembling a cylinder which grows narrower at top It is open be∣low about the height of a man made with wooden stakes and brushwood well plaistered with mortar In this chimney they burn faggots set up an end Near the chimney is a little hearth whereon they set a boiler to dress their victuals and this boiler has a par∣ticular pipe to let out the steam Their chimneys are wellcontrived but as the wood burns well and very bright it hurts the eyes more than the smoke of course they labour constantly under some ocular disor∣der  The principal piece of houshold furniture in the fil∣thy hovels of the Baskirians is a high bottle like a leathern vessel fastened on a wooden frame and always full of sour milk or  arjan  Whilst the cattle yield milk and they have store of honey the Baskirians live jovially and use no other drink than sour milk or mead but as they seldom like to clean these vessels the of∣fensive smell may easily be conceived In winter or when travelling they supply the want of this drink by little cheeses  krut  made from very four milk and dried in the smoke this they bruise and soak in water which makes a sourish drink Their usual food is thin broth which they send with wooden spoons partly down their throats and partly over their beards They sow no more wheat than they want for their own use and this is but little Indeed it is little to be expected that they ever will become good husbandmen as they are so much taken up in breeding bees and horses which enriches them sufficiently for the indolent man∣ner of life established among them They do not eat bread every day and are said to bake it like the first men Their women kneed with unwashed hands a cake with water and salt and bury it in the hot cinders of the hearth they then put a stick into the cake and toast it before the fire till it is brown  The dress of the Baskirian women differs little from that of the women of Tschuwa The most essential difference is in the headdress where instead of that  long latchet beset with silvercoins which flows down the back being fastened to the cap it is here fixed to a quadrangular conical plate fastened on the opening of the cap on the top of the head the whole richly de∣corated with little silvercoins or plates Both sexes wear shirts of coarse linen made of hemp or from a thread spun from the large nettle very wide trousers buskins or slippers The poor wrap their legs in rags and wear shoes made of the bark of a tree The net∣tles which they spin for lines grow in a fat soil near their habitations and are dried in autumn with the hemp After this being watered the outside rind is taken off with the hands by breaking the stalk and then beaten in a wooden mortar till they are reduced to tow As to their persons they are without exception the fil∣thiest and worst behaved of all the Tartarian or Tschu∣wan nations but I shall have an opportunity of speak∣ing of them again  Before I could reach Ufa I was obliged to pass the Uralian mountains which are full of minerals and many of which are covered with wood and the neigh∣bourhood inhabited by Tartars Tschuwanians c I passed a coppermine worked by the Baskirians  Upon the rocky mountains along the Belaja which I passed in great haste grows the savinbush used by the Baskirians to smoke their sick children with They also put it over their doors from an idea that it  has a particular virtue against witchcraft It differs not in the least degree from the common savin  Sabi∣na  except that it's bluish berries generally contain but one two or three seeds The forests here produce considerable larches which like the savin is not to be seen westward of the Uralian mountains On the old trunks of this tree we find not only the medicinal larchmushroom  Agaricus Officinarum  which the Baskirians bruise and strew upon the wounds of cattle but also a rosin oozing out which sometimes is resi∣nous and sometimes gummy and dissolves perfectly in water By order of the imperial college of physicians a great deal of this gum has been gathered in the pro∣vince of Ufa which in pharmacy may be used in∣stead of gumsenega or Arabiangum It's colour is not so clear but it has such a degree of viscidity or adhesion that it may answer all the purposes of foreign gums in mechanics and manufactures It is remark∣able that a certain tree a species of the resintree si∣milar to this produces sometimes resin and sometimes gum and I have now an opportunity of confirming an observation of the learned  Dr Rinder  respecting the larchtree that in spring it produces a gum in winter a degenerated juice but in autumn a real resin The same naturalist has assured me that in April when the larch issues forth bladders a fluid resin may be gathered from it in every respect similar to the bal∣sam of Mecca Nay some pretend it may be extract∣ed from the white fir  It may readily be supposed that in the neighbour∣hood of the Ural there are many noble birds of prey Here is a kind of vulturehawk and other beautiful spe∣cies of hawks  Falco barbarus et arborarius  also di∣vers kinds of eagles A large species of owls  Stryx Uralensis  is also very common here though I never saw them described any where  Ufa  I reached Ufa after travelling miles from JaizkoiGorodok on the d of October wintered there very disagreeably and did not leave it till April In the vicinage of this place on the high roads are three or four houses of accommodation for travellers kept by Russians  Ufa is an illbuilt city and very much decayed The neighbourhood being richly peopled with Baskirians it's situation would be a bad one if it was not a place of security against the invasions of these Baskirians and others It contains about six or seven hundred houses dispersed in irregular lines on the bank of the Belaja and owing to a bend of that river forms a kind of crescent Torrents of snow and rainwater rushing down from the heights above it encompass the city all round and the houses being built on the declivity of a hill have a good effect and contribute to it's safe∣ty which now indeed seems established by the peaceable disposition of it's neighbours and the fortifi∣cation of it's frontiers The ancient works of Ufa are  mostly decayed and there is scarce a trace to be seen of that line of palisadoes that ran near five miles along the town and covered the fields and pastures belonging to this place in any trouble or commotion there re∣mains only now some relicks of an old watchtower  The situation of the city it's six churches in several quarters of it and particularly it's stonebuilt cathe∣dral standing with many other public buildings on an elevation surrounded with palisadoes give it the ap∣pearance of an amphitheatre and make it look better than it is but it is dreary enough in spring when a traveller comes and at other wet times The corrupt∣ed manners of the people render an abode here the more disagreeable for there is scarce a substantial or civilized inhabitant except those persons who belong to the office of mines and manufactures the city not being able to boast of a regular trade or a good ma∣nufactory except a few tanners who have here a tan∣mill worked by one horse Indeed they have no workmen As to their trade it has not been extend∣ed further than to travel to Casan to fetch goods to sell to the Baskirians whom they supply at an exorbitant rate and who come here to buy or to attend the court of justice The inhabitants indeed are so careless and so indifferent about improving their state and situation that they suffer the Casanian and Ufian Tartars to run away with the lucrative trade of honey and wax and a few more important articles as marten and boarskins  horses and cattle But this inactivity is the more deplore∣able as Ufa by it's situation might become the chief magazine of the whole regency of Orenburg if the inhabitants had the least spirit of trade in them the transport by water being practicable through the Rama and Wolga to the innermost parts of the empire even to seaports By the communication of the Belaja with the other rivers and the arms or sidewaters running from the Uralian mountains rocksalt is conveyed to great distances for vessels are built here for this pur∣pose and always lying at anchor at Ufa  The district of Ufa is inhabited on the west south and northwest by Ufian Tartars related to the Ca∣sanians but settled here long since They are very numerous throughout all the land lying between the Belaja and the river Ik which falls into the Rama The Tartars are of all the inhabitants of the Ufian district the most industrious husbandmen and general∣ly men of property and indeed it is no wonder that by their economy they should prosper well in a coun∣try abounding in excellent pasturage and woods profuse with all the advantages that may be derived from hunt∣ing fishing and breeding of bees Their method of husbandry is this they cultivate all the land round their habitations and divide a field into three parts one of which lies fallow every year in which fallow part they let their cattle run which is as good as a dressing Thus are their fields fertile for years and fit for wheat  which they do not neglect Should the fertility of such spots fail and they cannot find a step near enough to their villages they will remove their wooden houses to some other place on this account they do not hedge in their huts but in wintertime keep their cattle in inclosures and when the cattle are abroad on the step in summertime sow those enclosures with hemp  In their way of living they are tolerably neat Men of property have besides their usual habitations a summerresidence with a Baskirian chimney and a large bench to sleep on The way from one to the other is laid with timber Few marry more than one wife none more than two In all their villages they have clerical schoolmasters who teach their youth to pray  The femaledress differs not very much from that of the Casanian Tartars Their common dress is like that of the Baskirians and the people of Tchuwa made of coarse linen worked slightly with the needle about the neck and wrists Girls are never seen but in their best headdress The woman's cap sits close to the head is cut out in front fastened underneath the chin and but∣toned on the top of the head the greatest part of which is covered with old silver coins or pieces of tin cut out to resemble coins but the front border of the cap is ornamented two inches broad with red coral beads  narrower about the cheeks and another row of the same beads runs from the top of the cap down to the part that binds the cheek From behind the cap hangs down a band above three fingers broad which passes through the girdle and so far is decorated with small coins and tin plates but further down to the joint of the knee with corals and fringes Two other small bands similarly ornamented go from the cap to the girdle to which last they are fastened by their fringe∣ends Behind the ears is fastened to the cap a breast∣plate beset with silvercoins proportionably orna∣mented and large or small according to the wealth or rank of the wearer hanging from underneath the chin down upon the bosom Over the head is a veil the tops of which hang down on the back Girls caps are quite round and not cut out upon the forehead the breastplate is very small and narrow no large band hanging down on the back only the two small ones and sometimes not these They wear their hair like the women braided into two tresses hidden in the nape of the neck and upon it they sometimes pin a little escutcheon ornamented with coins and fringes Com∣monly their headdress consists only of coralbeads as the best and rich headdress is the gift of the bride∣groom when a young couple is going to be married But among the more wealthy of these people girls caps are also ornamented with coins I saw a girl the frontpoint of whose cap was much lengthened and car∣ved in wood I also saw a girl who wore as an orna∣ment  two triangular flaps beset with coins and made round on the lowerpart which were fastened together on the forehead behind and underneath the chin and covered only the sides of the head leaving the whole head of hair bare Except these little changes in dress there is no difference between the Ufian and Casanian Tartars Their language and manners are the same for in the district of Ufa they live promiscuously to∣gether  The environs of Ufa rise by degrees in considerable hills which at some distance from the city are over∣grown with woods of mixed trees and higher up the Ufa is still more woody The mountains are lime∣stone and stucco with now and then a mixture or bad alabaster This district has no ores except a few veins of a copper that is not worth the digging Pe∣trifactions are very rare among the lime yet I found some madreporites up the Ufa and they shewed me in Ufa a very large knucklebone of an elephant which had been found with the head c and some other bones of this animal in a washed bank of the Belaja above Ufa and was in a tolerably sound state  There are also upon the heights west of this city some large overgrown tumuli which have been open∣ed many years Three of these tumuli situated on a very elevated spot strike very much a scrutinizing eye Some say these were the tombs of governors  who resided here before this district submitted to the Rus∣sian sceptre and it is also said that all neighbouring Bas∣kirians paid tribute to these governors Indeed there are many monuments of antiquity above Ufa which shew that this place was inhabited by a people very different to the present There are on the other side of the Diouma not thirty miles from Ufa erections that certainly were not built by the present people these are a kind of sepulchral chapels built of brick and have round them many Arabian or Koptian tombstones with inscriptions Mr  Krafft  has given us many The inscriptions contain the name and quality of the person interred the year he died and some moral sen∣tence beneath Here follows a translation of two  This Stone  is placed for  MINKA ARTSOF  in the th year of the Hegyra  All men are mortal  God only is eternal  He that worships God saith the Prophet and ab∣stains from sin is one of Mahomet's nearest relations  GHAS HOUSYAM BYATH  Learned in the Law  And  By the rules of Justice a Judge  Lies here dead  To thee our only God  We offer up our prayers  That thou may'st have mercy on him  And grant him favour  By remitting him his sins  He died in the year  In the th night of the sacred month  He laboured and would have continued so to do  But Death who frustrates the designs of men  Hath cut him off  None of us find here a lasting home  On viewing this tomb  Think on  His last hour  The present winter was not very rigorous yet it was disagreeable on account of it's dark and stormy wea∣ther The most violent frost was felt in the third week in November and on the d we had storms in which many travellers on the desarts lost their lives These storms continued the whole month of December almost without interruption yet the cold was not very severe The month of January was moderate that of February very temperate but the month of March concluded the winter with a still greater frost that con∣tinued to the middle of the month accompanied by a deep and universal snow which was the principal cause of the late inundation  The birds of passage appeared with the end of March flying towards the south from which quarter after the river was freed from the ice we saw a great many common geese  Anser Erythropus  seeking a colder climate Woodcocks and the seapye remained in great numbers even before the ice broke and sought their food on those heights that were not covered with snow  Having sent some of my retinue in the month of February back to Gurjef near the Caspian sea in order to spend the spring there I will from the ob∣servations they made add here several remarks con∣cerning the arrival of birds of passage in that more southern district not quite useless to natural history The river Jaik began to break on the th of March Long before this and in the latter end of February all sorts of seamews were seen in flocks upon the ice which had not left the Caspian sea during the whole winter With the last of February arrived large flights of swans geese ducks and bitterns evidently from the west Bitterns come from the south but never from the northwest The heron was the only bird seen singly after the water was clear of ice but the latest and about the middle of March appear∣ed the spoonbill heron and searavens  Pelecanus Carbo et Pymeus  Landbirds and birds of prey were at hand with the end of February There was also straying at this time a fine species of large and black  larks  Alauda Persica  which commonly do not exceed the th degree but seemed to seek their home which is probably Persia and India The hawk of passage  Falco barbarus  seemed to come the latest among all other birds of prey yet there was one shot near Gurjef on the th of April though this bird sel∣dom frequents those flat countries but inhabits the fa∣mous high mountains in the province of Ufa where they build their nests and pass the summer The last arrival of all birds of passage was a beautiful species of quite green beeeater  Merops Tartarica  in the beginning of May these dwell only in the vicinage of the Caspian sea and are never seen higher up the river Jaik  Swallows were seen on the th of April whilst the weather was warm and serene but as on the th the south and westwind began suddenly to blow north and caused a sharp frost till the th at night these birds and other little ones disappeared yet became visible again on the th when the weather grew mild This circumstance occasioned a curious observation On the th of March I received by one of my peo∣ple whom I had sent to Gurjef a common swallow which a Tartar had found lying in a field apparently dead and stiff with frost This swallow had scarce been a quarter of an hour in my room which was mo∣derately warm than it began to breathe and at last it fluttered about the room where it lived some days till  it died by an accident There remains not a doubt therefore but that those swallows which have been found in winter in fishingnets clefts and hollow trees apparently dead may be made lively again by warmth there being reason to believe that they are only be∣numbed by accident perhaps by some sudden autum∣nal frost and passed thus the winter in so torpid and extraordinary a state which seems to run counter to the laws of nature and indeed we should find here in win∣ter many more swallows than we do if they did not retire with other birds of passage to a warmer climate  The budding of trees and their bloom was this year a whole month later than it was last spring about the Samara even some weeks behind the trees of Oren∣burg of which I had an account The appletree in the neighbourhood of Ufa began to bud on the th of April and was in bloom the beginning of May not not much sooner the wild black cherry  Padus  and service tree  Sorbus  much later the plane the hazel the wayfaring tree  Opulus  the cornelian cherry  Cornus Sanguinea  the elm the linden and the oak  END OF PART I  TRAVELS THROUGH Siberia and Tartary PROVINCES OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE  By S PALLAS M D PROFESSOR OF NATURAL HISTORY c  Part II  I Now prepared to set out to cross the Uralian moun∣tains in my way to the province of Isetta dis∣patched a soldier on the th with necessary orders to mend the roads and bridges and followed myself on the th Some few miles from Ufa on the righthand of the road is a deep hole called by the inhabi∣tants  Besdonnaja Jama  bottomless pit Three years ago a murrain among the horned cattle raged dreadful∣ly  and great numbers died They carried the carcases of these and threw them into this pit which occasioned a large troop of mad dogs to assemble about it and rendered the district so dangerous that a company of armed soldiers were sent out to clear them away  At the distance of about twentyfive miles from Ufa I slept for the first night in a village that contains but ten houses it's inhabitants are of that sort of people called  Tepterei  These pay but a small polltax to what others pay but must furnish the crown gratis with carts and horses to transport the rocksalt of Jlez∣kaja and the number of this people in the province of Ufa alone exceeds consisting of Tartars Tscheremissians and those of Tschuwa The Tartars residing here are the offspring of the Casanians and differ from the Ufa Tartars I occasionally met with some of these people The common dress of their women is a shift of died linen or cotton they wear on their head the veil  Tastar  with a blue and green rib∣band laid round the head in form of a garland as do the Casanian Tartar women putting on the rich headdress only at festivals and on solemn occasions  They are here so industrious in breeding bees that some families have above stocks in the woods which yield them annually upwards of lb of ho∣ney Their method of breeding them is the Baskirian They hollow the trunks of all sorts of trees but prefer  BASKIRIAN BEEHIVES  those of hard wood twenty or twentyfive feet from the ground if the height of the tree will admit it When hollowed they work it smooth on the inside The Baskirians are very clever at this work All the branches below the hive are then cut off to prevent the bears from climbing up and notwithstanding this care and various means are used to keep them off and de∣stroy them these animals are very hurtful to the hive in the Uralian forests they frequently fix sharp knives sickles and other iron weapons c on several parts of the tree the cutting part turned upwards so that a bear will go up without hurting himself but in coming down again he wounds himself in such a manner as to lose his life They have a contrivance also by which a bear climbing up touches a cord which shoots an ar∣row at him and pierces his heart Others hang on the most distant branches with long ropes a large board so that it will reach to the hive and there tie it with bast the bear finds his seat on this board convenient for opening the hive sets to work gnaws through the bast to get at the hive which lets loose the board and off he swings when if he is not immediately thrown down by the violence of the motion during his fright he must resolve at a dangerous leap or patiently remain If he falls or jumps sharppointed wooden palesare pla∣ced underneath to receive him if he stays where he is he is killed with arrows or firearms Sometimes a bear is watched and killed either upon trees or at night about the stocks he has begun to molest or near some  carcase In winter they trace bears in the snow hunt them with hounds and kill them with lances  Another enemy to beehives is the beeeater which they strive to keep off by surrounding the hives with all kinds of thorns Nay the Tartars believe there are persons whose very looking on a hive is injurious to the bees To guard against this they suspend especially before such hives as are near their houses the bones of a horse's head or other bones that the eye may first fall on these objects and thus avoid the superstitious in∣fluence of magic looks  This whole district is rich with martens of a good kind whose skins will sell from s d English to s and s d each according to the goodness and the number of buyers This therefore is an encourage∣ment to the Baskirians and other inhabitants to hunt and their method is to trace the animal in the first fall of the snow and when they meet with it pursue it with their dogs or bring it down from the trees by a gun or an arrow In many of the brooks there is fine otterhunting Indeed there are so many of this animal that they catch them with beamtraps laying some fish or a crab for a bait They kill also a great number of squirrels whose skins are sold with other furs to the Tartars who travel among them for the purpose but marten skins are by far the most valuable They catch now and then a bad sable in the Uralian forests  but it is seldom Elks and roes are to be met with in the upper districts of the mountains but there is scarce a wolf or fox to be found on account of the thickness of the forests  The only insect here worth notice is the cranefly  Tipula polygama  and this for its extraordinary mode of copulation About each female assemble ten twenty or more males which lay entangled together with their legs If one separates them never less than two but often three or even four males are found in close con∣nexion with the female These craneflies fly but lit∣tle but they run about like spiders and are a prey to the glowworm  Cicindela hybrida et Sylvatica  On the th of May I reached the Symskoi iron∣mills the situation of which is uncommonly beautiful being a little plain betwixt two woody mountains The works are erected on a branch of the river Sym where salmon are caught six or seven feet long and a fine sort of trout On the water are two mills six forges and three hammermills each mill working four hammers Here is also an anchorforge and a furnace The Sym is not navigable on account of its rapidity of course they transport their iron some distance on sledges during the winter They manufacture here from to puds of iron annually each pud lb English The workmen are all slaves but are paid a sufficient salary to live comfortably with their families The work∣mens  houses are a stonebuilt church stands on a vacant spot near them and a good wooden mansion in which the minister lives who has a countryhouse and a garden the whole fortified with a breastwork of timber laid on each other feet one way over and feet the other  In changing of horses at one of the villages the Baskirians brought one of those which they said was of the breed of Schaitan Kudei and would draw me well through any difficulty On enquiring into the nature of this breed they told me that the first fire or fatherstallion married the daughter of a mountain spirit or devil Schaitan whom he met with in a ca∣vern he made in an adjacent mountain and that from this alliance this breed of horses sprang  About fortythree miles further on on the Uralian mountains is another ironmanufactory established in The number of houses here are The church and fine mansion of  Jacob Twerdischef  who is principal director of all the numerous ironmanu∣factories erected by his relations in the district of Oren∣burg are built only of wood but the storehouses and forges are built with stone The works here are all forti∣fied consist of a double furnace four forges fifteen hammers and an anchorforge besides these there is a common forge two furnaces to heat the bars and a sawmill They melt here annually puds of  raw iron to supply the hammers They fetch the ore thirty miles in the wintertime and it yields fiftysix puds per hundred and more of raw iron of this they manu∣facture here puds in bars and the rest is con∣veyed to the other manufactories I have mentioned All these are conveyed together to a newly erected manu∣factory of three hammermills and a sawmill with houses on the river Jurjus where in spring it is put on board vessels built on purpose and carrying each puds  Dr Pallas now proceeds to describe two or three caverns in the lime mountains of Ural which he vi∣sited and this he does with the knowledge and accu∣curacy of a philosopher but as they are not by far so wonderful and curious as our caverns in the peak of Derbyshire which have been often described I trust my readers will consent to pass them over  On the th of May says our author I arrived in the village of Nissebasch upon a brook of the same name Here are a people called Mestscheraks who as often as required are obliged to do the same military duty with the Cossacks these emigrated eight years since from a station on the river Ufa into this district and prosper exceedingly well having a tract of fine ara∣ble land situated between the mountains about the ri∣ver Jurjus Having settled among some Baskirians they pay them an annual rent of twentyfive co∣pecks  or English each family for as much land as they can or will cultivate besides pasture and wood On the same footing are all other Tartarian villages that are established in the country of the Baskirians The soil is here quite black and fertile to the utmost degree and never needs manuring These Mestscheraks en∣close their fields with hedges and let their cattle run upon the lay fields They turn up every new piece of ground with a Tartarian plough but if the weather be dry they put from four to six horses to it In moist weather and on all other occasions they use the Russian plough In such new ground the first year they sow hemp and bearbarley This barley produces ten or fifteen fold Every ten or twelve years they leave a field and seek a new one They carry on a considerable corn trade with the ironmanufactories and breed a great many cattle and bees The country here abounds with foxes and martens and I saw a particular invention for catching woodcocks in winter which deserves notice  They stick forks here and there in the ground near trees in thin birch woods where these birds mostly re∣treat and upon these forks lay a cross pole one end of which is tied to the tree the other resting on the fork to which they tie bunches of corn At a little distance from this they make a funnel of birchrods about five feet high by sticking the rods in the ground as close to each other as the wires in a cage leaving one end of the funnel open at the top and about an ell in  MEDSCHERAKS CATCHING WOODCOCKS  diameter In the opening or mouth of this funnel they fix a wheel which moves round an axis and con∣sists of two hoops crossing each other and wound round with straw and ears of corn Now the birds fly first upon the cross pole placed near the tree and if they fly on the ears of corn fastened about the hoops of the wheel they can settle no where but on the hoop when the wheel immediately turns with them and lets them fall into the funnel from which they cannot es∣cape  Before I leave these Metscheraks I must observe that the women differ in dress from the Tartars with whom they have the same language the same manners and the same Mahomedan religion I speak not of the men for all the men in this country dress nearly alike The reader I trust will form a better idea of their dress from the plate than from any description I can give I shall only remark that the form of the cap orna∣mented in front with silver coins and beads of co∣ral is the same with that of the Ufian Tartars the principal difference is in the veil which hangs down from the hind part of the head and in the wide sleeves  Having heard of a burning mountain in the ad∣joining district of the Mursalarskian Baskirians I went twelve miles to see it This mountain is situated on a bend of the river Jurjusen It is a very steep one and covered with wood but on three of the highest  parts near a southern precipice are several bare red∣dish spots which spots are burning and we drew near the place by a very dangerous path Every thing here was flourishing to which  burning of this moun∣tain and the heat it spreads around must undoubtedly contribute  On the eastern side which is now the burning side the mountain seems to be fathoms in perpendicular height It has burnt on the eastern side only for the last three years and that less violently than in the middle height the whole southern side being burnt out for the subter∣ranean fires have existed about twelve years A sen∣sible Baskirian gave me the following cause of it Ele∣ven or twelve years since a tall pinetree that stood westward quite at the bottom of the middle part of the mountain was fired by lightning which consumed the very roots of the tree and thus penetrating the body of the mountain it has since burnt inwardly with∣out interruption yet so that the fire has ceased at the bottom and yet is far from having reached the top The whole southern side now bare he told me was once like other parts overgrown with trees and bushes which have been consumed as far as the fire reached namely a space of which the smallest diameter must be fathoms the greatest and upwards The fire also communicated to an adjacent spot on the wes∣tern side but is there extinguished and the place is now overgrown with all sorts of plants particularly  the fragrant dame's violet  hesperis Siberica  the lupin after and wild liquorice  astralagus  The eastern part to which the fire passed three years ago through a small part of the valley then covered with birchtrees is now quite green again but yet burns with great violence and exhibits almost as large firespots as the middle part of the mountain  The stone of which this mountain consists espe∣cially in those spots which are burnt out is partly a reddish slate and sonorous yet seems to be a kind of limestone and partly a soft consumed stone di∣vided into thin foliaceous layers between which there appears to have been some other matter now burnt to ashes In the eastern part where I ordered the men to dig as deep as the heat would allow I found the stone in coarse layers but the deeper we went the finer and looser it was The layers seemed to incline from west to east though in general I could find no determinate order owing to the sinking of the ground in such consumed spots In many places I met with a yellow ochre ironstone and at the bottom of the eastern part lies every where between the stones a light red friable marle The burning spots are full of large clefts and crevices so that it was dangerous to walk on them In some places the men sunk into the soft burnt ground up to the knees and could scarce get out again without feeling the fire From the open clefts rises continually a burning hot vapour which no  one could put their hands near and which on throwing birchbark or dried chips into it they immediately caught fire During stormy and gloomy nights red thin flames or fiery vapours rise to some height yet there is no sulphureous smell or coallike vapours the exhalation which rises communicating no other sensa∣tion than that suffocating heat which issues from a hot glowing oven after the embers have been cleared out As deep as we dug there was no smell though we dug till the stones were hot enough to hiss with any mois∣ture and burn the wooden spades  Not only on the outside but within the burnt spots the ground was cold and the common orach was growing on the places The bottom of the middle part of the mountain was covered with luxuriant herbage which as the Baskirians told me was not the case before it's burning We saw a great number of adders about the place which were here before it caught fire The Bas∣kirians assured me that during winter no snow would lie on it that the soil was always green and had plants in flower through the whole winter  On the opposite shore of the Jurjusen is another curiosity A little brook comes down a height adjacent to the river and throws itself after a course of sixty fathoms with a steep fall into the river and in that little space of sixty fathoms turns four mills  In passing over a woody mountain I could not but take notice of the vast number of large and tall pinetrees and asps either broke leaning or torn up by the roots by a hurricane that had raged for five days together The wool of the asp might be gathered here in great abundance if the people were not so in∣dolent the branches might be lopt and carried to the houses and when dry the wool will shake off It may be worth the attention of a speculator whether aspwool in the common way would not be a good substitute for foreign cotton and as it has a much better gloss and is considerably finer than cotton it deserves an attentive trial I mentioned this to a learned friend and he told me he had tried a similar experiment with the wool of the willow  Epilobium  and it had suc∣ceeded beyond his expectations  I next passed an extensive manufactory of iron where they make bars and cast vessels belonging to a merchant who employs men constantly and more occasion∣ally The ore they use here is at the distance only of twelve miles and produces half it's weight in good raw iron which does not lose a third part under the hammer The bariron here manufactured is so tough that it will bear the hammer without heating and they send away annually above puds in barges that carry puds each to different sea∣ports and places of the empire Here I saw them catching vultures by means of falltraps fastening live  pidgeons as baits These vultures are sent in great numbers to the Imperial court  Travelling on the chief of a neighbouring village came up to us with a large body of armed Baskirians to serve as an escort but we declined his polite offer as unnecessary On account of the troubles which arose this spring on the frontiers of the Kirgnisians every Baskirian had been ordered to be armed with lances bows and arrows for they are not allowed to carry any fire  ms Those who inhabit the eastern part of the Ural and most of the provinces of Iserskaja are much more substantial than any I have met with before The excellent pasture in this district gives them a fine opportunity to breed horses and it is not rare to see some persons who possess from to pieces of this land In short this step is so rich in wholesome and nourishing pastureplants that it is pity but such as sow artificial grasses and make meadows could get the seed from this part of the world The Esparcette and Redysarum of the Alps besides innumerable spe∣cies of trefoil codded plants mugworts and star∣worts are universal here and they will agree with every climate  The natural indolence of the Baskirians prevents their providing any stock of hay for the winter of course they turn out their horses on the step and oblige them to search for their food by scraping off the snow  and if as it often happens a thaw should follow the first snow and cover the ground with ice these poor creatures are almost without food and become mise∣rably lean so that it is wonderful that under these cir∣cumstances they should breed so fine horses as they do especially when it is considered that they deprive the colts of great part of their nourishment by milk∣ing the mares for kumyss and tying the colts all day to a stake  In many parts of this province the Baskirians keep camels but in small numbers as these animals were taken off by a distemper that raged among the great cattle a few years since The fact is that the pasture of the country and the severe winters do not agree with the constitution of this animal They breed also very fat sheep Besides their wealth in cattle they are great husbandmen they sow nothing however but sum∣mercorn barley and oats and seldom more than they want for their winterprovision added to their smoked cheese or krut for as their cattle yield but little milk at that time of the year and they have no kumyss they would do very ill without krut They assured me in general that if a person gets drunk with good mare's milk kumyss he will not have the least appetite till the third day after for this reason they use it in summer as their chief food  The dress of the Baskirian women on this side of the Ural has something more elegant in it than the cus∣tomary dress of this nation The habit is made of linen worked about the neck and wrists the cap or  Tschaschbau  decorated with silver coins and other parts of their dress are the same with that of other Baskirian women but the broad ornament which hangs like an order on the shoulders and consists partly of coins partly of coral beads and several little toys I never observed among other Baskirian women Here the women wear it from morning to night and do all sorts of work with it though it is inconvenient and much in their way Indeed they do not like to be seen without it They call this part of their heavy dress  Dilbuga  and men cover the reins of their horses with the same stuff from which one cannot form a very favourable idea of the respect which the Baskirians pay to their ladies Indeed it is but little  I now passed over the east side of the Ural which is very steep and alternately cloathed with birchtrees and larches We found here several streaks of ore of which the mountain is rich and most of the ores con∣tain some mixture of noble metals  At the bottom of the mountain is a village consist∣ing of houses inhabited by Baskirians and sent  here to form a colony They are substantial husband∣men and sow all sorts of corn except buckwheat the environs of this place exhibit many mineral curiosities which though not very considerable deserve notice On some spots on the borders of the lake have been found some fine yellow topazes Round the village one finds every where on digging an ochreous and shining stone containing a small alloy of gold Northeastward of the village is a height of bare rocks thinly overspread with wood The rock is in a soft state and full of gold and silvery brilliancy the layers of which run almost east and west On the report of some Baskirians people were set here to work and a soft vitrifiable matter overspread with large purplebrown irregular granates and some other black mineral have been foundThe latter produced a gold alloy of five ths of a Solotnik or dram  per  puds of ore A little fur∣ther westward lies a black ironstone and at the distance of two miles in a low marshy and salt district under∣neath the ground is dug a very white though coarse earth samples of which have been sent to the Imperial Chinamanufactory  On the first of June I set off from the Sawod in pursuit of an allumrock I had heard of and crossed a lit∣tle brook in a ferry which though very narrow and shallow is so rapid that we were carried a great way down we should have passed it without a boat but our horses could not keep their feet and when we got  on the other side they carried us over a step but were too weary to climb a mountain beyond it and it growing dark we were obliged to put up with a very bad night's lodging We chose the upper rocks of the height we were in as the driest spot of the whole district We thought to have made a fire but by ill luck had not materials to strike a light Vainly did we try to produce fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together of course we were obliged to be contented with a dry spot without fire and by means of our cloaths and branches of trees we formed a Baskirian travelling tent underneath this we stretched ourselves on our saddlefelts and though this bed was very wet the rain having penetrated through it yet we slept perfectly sound till the next morning  At dawn we rose briskly from our rest and break∣fasted on a glass of water from an adjacent brook which would have been an excellent relish if we had had a fire to dry and warm ourselves we therefore hoped to do it by quick riding but even that could not be done owing to the steep and stony ways and the felled trees that lay in our way At last we reached the al∣lummountain which was beautifully decorated with lindentrees and all sorts of fine plants especially three different species of lady's slipper  To follow  Pallas  in the description of this mountain would an∣swer no good purpose  From this allummountain we went to another where is an isinglass pit It lies on an elevated rocky tract consisting of a reddish or white dry and very brittle quartz singularly ornamented with isinglass and covered with a glittering sand mixed with a red loam In this very quartz we found the isinglass in nests in various positions forms and layers com∣monly very impure and of moderate transparency about a yard in length The pit is in sundry places fourteen feet deep and the works are carried on at the expence and for the profit of the magistrates at Ufa  From this place I turned back to take a view of the chinaearth manufactory erected since the year where the porcelain earth is washed and cleaned and from thence carried to Petersburgh to be made into china This manufactory is surrounded with a wall of timber and has two cleansinghouses a house for drying the china one for the master ten dwellings for his eighteen apprentices and a necessary storehouse to deposit the unwashed earth A description of this must be agreeable to every reader To wash this earth which is dug about six miles off and brought here they have a number of vessels each about seven feet deep The raw earth is first put into the large tubs with water to soak divide and dissolve here it is left seven or eight hours that all coarse and sandy parts may be separated from it which is sooner done  if the weather is fine and serene than when it is gloomy After this the earth is poured into other tubs through fine hairsieves where it is to settle again and there the thin matter is strained through taf∣fety sieves into the deep tubs in which the pure white chinaearth settles by degrees at the bottom and the water is drawn from it by tapholes which are made at different heights in the tubs till there remains a fine sandy sediment this sediment is afterwards passed through three tubs standing upon each other it is first poured into the upper one and the earth there settling the watery part that remains is let into the one next under it here it settles again and lastly into the lower tub This is done that all the fine sand may be deposed from the water This sandy sediment is next brought into a hothouse and spread over a sailcloth fastened upon several cords on frames in order that all the water may run out and when the white porcelain earth is become solid it is made into large tiles of about twelve pounds weight each Of fifty puds of raw earth they make about eight and a half of pure chinaearth and they prepare here monthly between three and four puds Every winter the prepared earth is sent to the regency of the province of Isetskaja from thence to the mineoffice of the ironmanufactory of Blagodat Kuschwinskoi and from that place trans∣ported with the iron barges of the Imperial manufacto∣ries on the rivers Kama and Wolga to the cabinet at Petersburgh  The chinaearth of this district known by the name of the earth of Isetskaja is of a beautiful white and possesses every requisite quality to make fine porce∣lain  My road led me along the borders of the river Mias where we saw great numbers of bustards and beauti∣ful red ducks feeding which build their nests in holes under ground The latter bird quits this climate in July as soon as it's young ones are grown up and returns in spring with the first birds of passage  I staid some days in the fort Tschiljabinskaja which is the most capital place in all the province of Isetskaja in order to secure my waggons and baggage in this place which I designed for my winterquarters at the close of this season I shall therefore give a description of it at the end of the year  Having left this fort I went to visit the mines be∣longing to Catherineburg and began by the most southern ones directing my way to two silvermines lately discovered in the province of Isetskaja Having heard that one called Senarskoi whose works had been discontinued for four years past was opened afresh by a person deputed by the supreme office of miners at Catherineburg I went to it over Etkulskaja Krepost This step is covered with trees and bears the finest pasture containing grasses only proper to  Siberia The whole step of Isetskaja is full in June and July of large yellow flies different from the com∣mon ones only in being twice as large and of a pale yellow colour They covered almost all our horses and in the neighbourhood of pools and lakes the air is filled with them especially in sultry weather or when tempestuous clouds trouble the sky About six miles to the westward from the abovementioned fort lie two lakes called by the Russians  Gorkje  bitter lakes on account of the bitterness of their waters which formerly are said to have been sweet Both lakes have reedy borders in which we met with a great many curious ducks not seen in any other inland waters of Russia Among them I remarked some quite black called  turpani  of which there are numbers here and a very little brown duck with a lightbrown bill that swims with it's hind parts entirely under water These are very good divers idle flyers and very bad walk∣ers This latter bird called from its voice  Sawki  is no where described I have therefore given a repre∣sentation of a young one and an old one  anas mersa  See the plate and also the description at the end of this volume  I continued my journey along the line of intrench∣ment from fort to fort up the river Uwelka and passed several Cossack villages where the inhabitants are substantial farmers At one of these I was told that the Kirguisians had on the th instant June made an attack on one of the forts only miles distant  FERULA ANAS MERSA PTEROCOCCUS  from this place and had put every body into fear and that of course all had put themselves into a state of defence and kept a continual lookout I was even told that these troubles had driven all the officers from the mine of Sanarskoi and that two days past all the workmen had been dismissed Being so near this did not interrupt my going but the people representing my journey as very dangerous I took with me a little escort of armed peasants and sent to the fort of Sanar∣skoi for a detachment of Cossacks to wait my coming at the mine yet I afterwards found that all my pru∣dence was unnecessary and that I might have done very well without any escort  The heat on the th of June was almost insupport∣able and De L'isle's thermometer rose in the after∣noon from to The first cause of the discovery of this mine was some pieces of a massive verdigrease which were sound here by a Tartar who shewed the spot to a customhouse director in whose zeal induces him to find out all sorts of useful minerals in the province of Isetskaja He began that very year to dig upon the spot and made a regular mineopening and as soon as they came to a certain depth they found whole masses of lead whereupon the proprietor made a report to the supreme mineoffice at Catherineburgh and solicited for a privilege to con∣tinue the works engaging to send all the ores which had any alloy of silver to the manufactories belonging  to the crown Further I know not The mineoffice that year deputed some officers from Catherineburgh and the mine was worked till the year at the ex∣pence of government when the death of the director and other unknown reasons caused an entire suspension and nothing since has been done The miners sent here stopped only a few days and did but very little of course I could see but little but shall communi∣cate all I was able to gather respecting the qualities of the ores  On the whole it appears that this is merely a clay mountain in which the ore lies sparingly scattered in thin layers and therefore no constant ore is to be here sought as in the mountains higher up the river Oi In this mine they have made but three shafts and a wa∣tergang which runs to the depth of several fathoms As the mountain is quite loamy and soft to dig it was easy but timbering it was more necessary and of course more expensive for the men could not go on a step without it In the hard ironstones there is a goldcoloured bright∣ness and whole streaks of a beautiful verdigris also masses of solid copper In the blue loam here dug they wash out massive veins of copper ore sometimes a fine glittering lead and silver streaks which amount to a tenth part of the earth Though the whole shewed no great alloy yet they found a sufficient quan∣tity of ores to make it pay for working Springs indeed prevented their digging very deep as they  could not be sufficiently turned off with engines but the water that was taken out from the mines served to wash the ore  From the alloy of the ore we dug here the following is a specification The coarse glittering lead with some verdigrease produced lb of lead per cwt one pound of copper and one ounce and a half of grains of sil∣ver the fine glittering lead lb of lead and one and three eighths of an ounce of silver the best copperore yielded lb of copper and four fifths of an ounce of silver in eight pounds of lead The small ore yielded but from two to four pounds of lead the eighth part of an ounce of silver and six pounds of copper per cwt  The other silver mine called Kuckuscha is situ∣ated at Kukuschefskoi upon a height that makes part of the mountain Akembettau which is rich with ores gently rising and without much wood and runs along the Ui The mine lies about two miles and a half southeast from the river and makes part of the Ura∣lian mountains The ores were discovered here about ten years ago by a Baskirian Sotnik who revealed them to the late possessor of the iron and copperma∣nufactories at Kosodurskaja who during all this time continued the works and ordered all ore to be mixed and melted together But another Baskirian took the ores of silver alloy into consideration and upon his  report the supreme mineoffice sent two deputies who are empowered to keep all silverore for the use of the crown and they pay a certain sum to the proprietors to pay the miners As the water was very high in the gangs I could not enter the mine but had an oppor∣tunity afterwards of inspecting them properly Be∣tween two shafts is an open pit in which the works were first begun and through which the miners go in and out The business is done by horses and some little dwellings are erected here and there for the master and the workmen The biggest shaft was near seven∣teen fathoms deep but since they have improved the works they have penetrated in January to a depth of twenty fathoms and there found the ore richer in silver and purer in copper The ore is dug in a shaft that runs very regular from east to west and it's length above thirtythree fathoms The streak is some∣times eight or ten feet strong and consists of a white and sat quartz lying in a grey chertz and cannot be got out but by blowing it up with gunpowder In the middle of the metalick streak the ore chiefly consists of a beautiful lazuli and verdigris and in these ores we find a blackish glimmering silverore overshot here and there with a coppercolour which upon trial yields from ten to twentyfour pounds of cop∣per and one of quartz to one ounce and a half of silver per cwt consequently puds of the better sort yield almost two pounds of silver There is also among this ore another brown substance which may be sup∣posed  to contain gold During the latter months of this year by constantly working they collected from seventy eighty to puds of the silver ore and the pud might be valued on the spot at from eight to ten copecs each copec one halfpenny English  There is little doubt but this mountain might be∣come more productive if it was opened with a searchshaft which certainly would lead to some fertile dis∣covery but as the matter depends only on the present proprietor who seeks his own interest in procuring a sufficient quantity of copper of which there is no want and at a little expence he has not spirit enough to go further unless he could see his advantage in so doing It is therefore the business of government to take it in hand and that 'tis their interest is past a doubt for according to the opinion of a mineofficer the whole adjacent mountain is full of silverore and many other places within a little distance  On the th of June I continued my journey to∣wards Catherineburg The usual way to that place cho∣sen by the copper and moneycaravans from the manu∣factories at Orenberg go first to the village Karassy but I went a mile out of my road to see the pits from which they prepare the porcelain earth of Tschebar∣kulskaja Since the establishment of the chinaearth manufactory I have already mentioned which is now about seventeen years they have fetched the earth  from this district which is found an ell deep under the salt black mire that covers the surface They find sometimes spots quite pure yet full of yellowish veins but cleansing it with their hands and little wooden spades the remainder goes off in the washing The white parts lie about in an ocherous yellow and soft clay Both the white and yellow earth when dug look as if composed of little scales and folia and when touched are very soapy yet do not ferment with acids  Each apprentice is expected to dig every day in summer ten puds of pure white earth which cannot always be done They begin digging in the middle of June as in these soils adjacent to the mountain the ground is often frozen an ell deep till towards the end of June  In our way to the village where we meant to sleep we had to cross the river Miass There was no bridge over it but as the river is commonly very shallow our design was to ford it However when we came to it we found it impassible for the storms and showers had increased it so much that it had transgressed it's banks was rapid and near ten feet deep Our business then was to make a float and a Baskirian hut which stood near the river answered our purpose the float was made and we got over When we came to the village the Baskirians had left it had retired with their flocks  into the cool mountains and had locked their doors but as a lock was no bar to us we soon had possession of a house or two and settled ourselves at pleasure Near each house was a little round oven built with brick with horizontal pipes communica∣ting with the oven at one end and a hollowed pine tree or cylinder about seven feet long set up on end This is a contrivance to smoke sheep and coltskins They hang a skin up across a pole on this cylinder and then by heating the oven with pineapples and foulwood the smoke issues through the pipes into the cylin∣der and smokes the skins done prior to tanning them in order to make them impenetrable by rain and give them a fine yellow colour on the inside  Travelling on we came to the enormous lake Uweldi in BaskirUjaldeKuly According to the general and unanimous calculation of the people who inhabit these districts this lake in circumference is between thirtyfive and fortyfive miles its length fifteen miles and it's breadth nine miles and they reckon seventyseven islands on it nine of them having lofty woods  Here are two other ironmanufactories in our way supplied with workmen who are obliged to work here for not paying the polltax to the crown of Russia the proprietors of the manufactories pay that tax for them and have their labour Four thousand six hundred and thirtyeight men are employed in these two ma∣nufactories  and they make annually puds of bariron which in winter is conveyed by the Ural to the river Ufa and from thence transported at highwater in twenty or more flat vessels to the Wolga  The district in which these manufactories stand be∣ing on account of the woody mountains many lakes bogs and springs cold and wet it is exceedingly un∣healthy entirely unfit for agriculture and seldom a year passes but they have a distemper among their cattle and sheep terminating by an internal inflammation Against this disorder they fumigate with the gum of the larch and with success Every larch by wounding it's bark will ooze out a clear resin tough and yellowish which if fresh possesses all the virtues of Venetian turpentine and might be gathered for the apothecaries in all the mountainous parts of Siberia This resin fills so much of the bark and the young wood of the larchtree and renders it so combustible that there is scarce a young larchtree to be found here which has not received some hurt by fire either by the burning of grass or some other accident and in such trees the gum has a brown colour dissolves in water is very like gumarabick and is known in Russia by the name of Or∣enburg gum The countrypeople gather no more of it than they want for their own use and assured me they made use of it as an emetic in cold fevers and as an astringent in long and obstinate cases of the  fluor albus  Sisertskoi  On the th of June I reached the manu∣factory of Sisertskoi erected in the year on account of several rich ironores discovered in the neighbour∣hood and then called  Imperatrizi Anni Sawoda  Here are an anchorforge where barhammers and all large manufacturing tools are made a sawmill two new hammermills containing five barhammers and one steel forge another with three hammers two platefur∣naces one for copper the other for iron and a high furnace which contains a foundery and covered with an iron roof Also a coppermill with two furnaces and a barhammer and two other furnaces for iron and steel a wellbuilt ballanceoffice and several warehouses for smiths Here is also a fine freestone mansionhouse for the proprietor an orangery par∣terres and flowergardens and the house elegantly fur∣nished Besides these places there is also a workshop where the neatest joiner's work is made not inferior to any made in England and a manufactory where several sorts of artists work in rooms allotted to them One for drawing in which designs plans and models are made one for locksmiths and coarse workmanships in copper and steel For steel they use here  crocus martis  and though they have no polishing frame yet the work∣manship seems almost to excel the English There is also another place for grinding and polishingstone and two others for fine engravings and other deli∣cate workmanship in coloured metals brass silver and gold  The proprietor of these works has also a stud in which there are eight select old and five young stallions and the tame and governable behaviour of these ani∣mals which are elsewhere quite wild and untamed is surprizing Opposite the stalls is a bathingroom to wash the stallions in winter Among his horses is one remarkable for his elegant whiskers which rise on the upper lip just underneath the nostrils and is a fine mark of nature He has also a menagerie a collec∣tion of animals containing fifteen of those tall stags called in the country  marali  and caught in the upper district of the river Irtisch some elks roes and camels which breed here besides a great variety of wildfowls I must lastly mention his herd of select bulls which are kept for work and though of Kirguisian race are notwithstanding remarkable for their size strength and beauty  The place consists of near dwellings and a church surrounded with a fortification of wood The proprietor is allowed peasants for felling of wood and burning of coal for the mines The iron annu∣ally brought here is puds very good and solid and may be cast raw as it is it yields onehalf pure iron and is dug close by The bariron manu∣factured here is conveyed in winter along Tsckussowaja to the warehouse established about seventyfive miles from hence and there shipped in barges and conveyed down the rivers Kama and Wolga Notwithstanding  the antiquity of this manufactory the woods round it are in a very good state and it seems as if the moist districts north of this place along the mountains were selected by nature for the production of resinwood  The first establisher of this extensive manufactory was LieutenantGeneral  De Henning  who was at that time chief president of the supreme mineoffice at Catherineburg and has been since one of the most con∣siderable manufacturers for the state till the year when the trade seemed to diminish and was given up by him to the present proprietor Mr  Turtschaninof  for the moderate sum of rubles with all the ironpits and mines belonging thereto and a consider∣able district of wood besides the masters and work∣men  On the th of June I made a little excursion to an asbestos mountain situated in a straight line about eleven miles from this manufactory though the sum∣merroad which I travelled was near twentythree miles It was discovered by accident about five years since The asbestos found here is a genuine plumeasbestos and lies together in lumps of three four or more puds each pud thirtysix pounds consisting of sibrous cones exceeding three feet in length The plumeasbestos is a whitegrey very heavy and some∣times has the insterstices of it's fibrous cones filled with a yellow earth or earth of a lucid green In the air it  becomes very soft and almost like hemp and in the pit as if rotten I found some pieces quite yellow and soft as rotten wood That which is exposed to the air a day or two is soft and fine enough to make pa∣per with and I speak it from experience having tried it  On the d of June I visited the famous old and rich coppermine Gumeschesskoi which might justly be reckoned as the most important and remarkable of all private mines in Siberia had it not been surpassed by the immense richness of some new ones discovered in the mountain Werchoburtskoi of which I shall give my readers a description yet on account of the num∣ber of works here carried on and it's fine ores it is the best worth seeing  It being impossible to give a circumstantial detail of the innumerable works which extend to a depth of twentyfive fathoms underground and consist of shafts streamworks and different branches and tracts I shall describe only the general situation and quality of the mountain the different sorts of ores dug here and the chief works of the mine and I shall be the more particular as few of my readers I presume are acquaint∣ed with the contents of a goldmine This mine then is situated three miles from the ironmanufactory of Poleskoi which is a similar one to that I have men∣tioned above The ore lies generally in a clay or  loam which being very soft is attended with little trou∣ble and expence in digging The different kinds of loam here met with are a yellow white grey one penetrated with vermilion a brown earth and on some spots a snowwhite loam much like pure porcelain earth It has been also observed that there runs through the middle of the one containing loam a small mountain of the most excellent snowwhite and beautifully halftransparent marble very fit for polishing and running according to the miners' language from noon to mid∣night This mountain will produce excellent marble for ornamental architecture and is the more valuable as none equal to it has yet been discovered in Russia Excellent ores are here found and dug up in large masses either in soft or hardened loams On the rightside of the mountain they dig only copperore but on the left chiefly a heavy and rich vitreous steelstone mixed with green and other copper substances whichrender it unfit for any thing The glassy sub∣stance which composes most part of the ironore is talcous and it's clefts full of a tincoloured soft blinde and often overshot with verdigrease They never dig this ironstone except when it lies in the way and it is necessary to remove it  The marks they follow are first the cinnabar seen in the loam next a brownblack copper sort of earth found in form of kidneys or eyes very similar to gar∣denearth and which appears sometimes solid like  black chalk and sometimes smooth like white lead and lastly the loam's appearing of a green colour The abovementioned vermilion which is mixed in the greatest abundance with the whitegrey loam makes it look like red marble and contains so much copper that when the tools used in it are brought to the forge for repair it is impossible to harden them properly on account of the copper substance which adheres to the iron until the hearth has been swept and entirely clean∣ed If this vermilion is looked at with a candle or light in the mine one may see on it reddish spots and intermixed massive copperdust  The most common and finest ore found in the mine of Gumeschesskoi besides this coppery clay is a solid malachites of two different sorts like verdigrease one is crusty and though but moderately hard is suscep∣tible of an excellent polish exhibits a most beautiful deep green and turcoislike stripes wanting nothing but more solidity This green crust forms itself very often about a grain of ochre and the clefts of large solid pieces often include a natural chrystaline verdigrease The other sort is plumy and like plumeallum exter∣nally tenderly rayed of a deeper colour heavier and richer than the former and velvetlike on it's natural surface and in digging wears the appearance of satin Both are found together in lumps like large and small kidneys often weighing above eighteen pounds and taking on various forms In the green crust we may  often observe a sparry stalactical structure and the spars are commonly bored through longways in the mid∣dle Between the crust and the white overshot surface of this species one sees black dendrities like figures of uncommon beauty  Besides this incomparable ore which renders the mine more noble one meets often with a loamore of a paler green having the appearance and solidity of limestone also some quartzlike nests containing ores Here they dig a very curious violet black or granitecoloured rich copperglass shooting in short quadrangular pyramids partly spread upon the quartz∣like stone or found in the clefts and is one of the purest ores of the mine On the red and hardened loam is a beautiful violet and reddish sediment of la∣zuli sometimes accompanied with plumy copper∣knots or massive tracts of copper Once they found a pure and soft copper resembling a web and formed in flat thin threads like plumemoss Fine massive copperveins are not uncommon as I have remarked in the loam but to my knowledge they never found any large lumps  It now remains to speak of the works The space hitherto worked out from the northermost to the sou∣thermost shaft is about fathoms Within this tract they have thirtyone shafts to the depth of from sixteen to twentyfive fathoms As this mine is much  troubled with water there are always eight engines go∣ing worked by horses for drawing it off These machines are of a peculiar construction and cannot be kept a moment out of motion or the deepest works would be drowned in a minute's time and for this purpose they keep horses six to each machine relieved eight times every twentyfour hours The streamwork from the middle of the works runs from the depth of nine fathoms to that of fathoms and above is thoroughly timbered and every year re∣paired Through this streamwork a timbered canal of about fifty fathoms long carries off the water There are here many shafts and pits filled up and it seems probable that they are the remains of the ancient works for this very rich mountain has been worked by that nation unknown to us whose industry and knowledge in mineralogy I have had occasion to men∣tion before and the southern parts of the Ural are an evident proof of the same The proprietor has a glove and a ragged leather knapsack in his possession which was found last month in this mine between white stones at the depth of nine fathoms Both consist of rein∣deers skin The glove is so made of the head of that animal that the ears serve as a reception for the thumb but both ends are open so that the glove may be put on the right or lefthand Notwithstanding the humid situation this glove has preserved it's natural hair but the knapsack which is above two feet long and one broad has suffered more from the ground  In this mine men are constantly employed and besides these there is employ for others such as overseers smiths harnessmakers stablemen and carters who bring here hay grass and timber for they use here annually pinebeams Besides this they employ in winter above peasants who are obliged to work for their polltax  Not far from this mine are two quarries of marble which have been opened a few years since and from which the most beautiful columns and pedestals are made to embellish the imperial palaces  A few miles from these quarries are some old mineshafts running deep into a mountain from which there was formerly dug some goldalloy but as it did not yield sufficiently when other mines were discovered this was deserted But adjoining a fortified village in the neighbourhood called Gornoi Stschit upon the river Uktus where was an ironmill and next to Ca∣therineburgh the oldest belonging to the crown but now neglected to give the young timber in the vici∣nage time to grow is erected some buildings for wash∣ing of the goldores brought from Beresosskoi con∣sisting of two stampingmills and contrivances to sepa∣rate the gold from the earth with which it is dug In these places the workmen are watched and guarded that they may not purloin any of the gold sediment With this sediment after frequent washings there is a  mixture of silver and iron the irondust is taken from it by loadstones but the silver and gold are sent to Petersburg together and there separated They pre∣pare here annually upwards of lb of gold from the best ore  Catherineburgh  June I arrived at Ca∣therineburgh on the d of June towards night This is a fine city the residence of a supreme mineoffice belonging to the mines in Siberia and the districts of Orenburg Casan c I shall not enter into any de∣scription of this place it having been accurately and faithfully set forth by Mr  Gmelin  in his travels through Siberia nor shall I say any thing of the manufactories there established for the benefit of the state I will only observe that the place has been since embellished with many fine private buildings a church elegantly built of stone that a coppermint which was then sus∣pended is now at work again and that the iron∣works of WerchJsetskaja which formerly belonged to Catherineburg are now in the possession of Count  Woronzof  I will proceed then to give a description of the goldmines at a little distance from the city which I inspected on the th and th  In my way there I passed another manufactory for washing of the gold which consists of two stampmills and other conveniencies Here are employed thirtyfive men who prepare every year lb of virgingold  This place is near six miles from the mines but they are obliged to submit to this inconvenience there not being water any nearer There are two other washingplaces besides these but not much nearer to the mines  GoldMines  The mines of Pyschma are by far the oldest of any goldmines in this district and were discovered in the year The first of these has eight shafts but as the ore became wanting without any farther hope it was deserted in A second was then begun but as the ore here is inconstant they seldom work in it except when the miners can be spared from other mines There is a third here which has now five shafts and is very productive Besides these there are two other considerable works which are not much attended to owing to the inconstancy of the ore but it is not so with the mine Kljutkhessko which was opened in with one shaft and has been increased with five others The works run here very deep and are very much exposed to water This mine is very rich in goldstreaks one of which is com∣puted to run upwards of sixty fathoms and it's sidegangs or shafts from twenty to thirty fathoms long  Under the name of the mines of Beresofkoi is un∣derstood those four mines situated in the neighbourhood of the brook and manufactory of the same name and now in work since That which promises best  has thirteen shafts the second has ten shafts the third has six and the fourth four All these mines are most actively worked and with the greatest order and regula∣rity The shafts streamworks and sideshafts are very spacious clean and welltimbered  The general situation and condition of the gold ores found here are as follow The metallick streaks of the mountains are full of little standing veins which run from noon to morning and fall into the depth in different angles from sixty to eight degrees from midnight towards noon It is not uncommon to find streaks which form a cross but most of them are direct These streaks which consist of a thick quartz with clefts are very disproportionate in length and strength Some are scarce an inch when others are more than two yards in thickness It has been remarked that a streak narrow in the beginning increases further on but those which begin large diminish soon after They are commonly from eight to ten fathoms long ex∣cept in the mine of Kljutschesskoi where they are much superior and extensive and the principal streak found in the engineshaft runs from sixty to seventy fathoms through the mountain and is found equally constant in depth The little streaks are usually during the first fathom the richest and at seven eight and ten fathoms are always poorer in depth though they run much deeper Such an observation appears rather extraordinary Where the streaks end  it is in small filaments It is generally observed that the ores lie in a white or a whiteyellow grey mild some∣what fibrous and glimmering loam running from midnight to noon from five to ten fathoms broad and their length often extending to fathoms into the mountain This loam separates readily from the veins but sometimes the streaks are environed with a grey∣red spotted chertz which causes a great deal of trouble to separate them and cannot be broke other wise than by gunpowder In this chertz or loam the streaks are sometimes scarce half an ell sometimes three or four ells and sometimes four or five fathoms distant from each other On all sides in the depth the streaks are bounded by a beautiful miniumlike white and spotted dry clay which is here called the robber of ores This clay yields a good red colour but when they come to it no farther trace of the ore is to be hoped for yet there are some exceptions for in the mines of Beresoskoi the ores are usually found in the abovementioned chertz and it is attended with much trouble to knock them off In the large streak of the mine Kljutschesskoi which I have mentioned a red∣dish sandy and variegated stoneloam is the distinctive mark of the ores and in the same mine the goldore in another shaft lies in sandlayers mixed with quartz fossils but the fossils themselves shew not the least alloy of gold  I will now describe the goldores and other curiosi∣ties dug therewith The most common ore in all the mines consists in a dark or blackish brown solid ironstone a spungy species full of curious cubes like dice of which I shall give a further description ac∣companied with a fine brownyellow rich ochre won∣derfully mixed and confused with quartz In this brown matter and the ochre which accompanies it the gold is interspersed like a fine dust Even those ores wherein the golddust is so small as scarcely to be dis∣tinguished with a magnifying glass are not without goldalloy and with such gold the washing houses or lavatories are chiefly supplied The goldalloy of the streaks is not always uniform but the richest ore breaks in nests though there is no visible change in the appearance and condition of the streak There are al∣so found in these streaks some very curious goldores of a particular species among these that which they call pumiceore deserves a description as it often oc∣curs This is dug in large and small cakes or masses in the midst of the goldstreaks from which it is sepa∣rated by it's yellowbrown sandy rind The internal parts of these cakes resemble at first fine spungy white bread or pumicestone or more properly the tender foliaceous texture of spungious bones and is uncommonly light for the matter consists of the purest and most tender folia which cross each other and form little cavities sometimes larger sometimes smaller and which like pumice will often sloat in water  The colour of this substance is white or yellowish here and there overshot with brown and sometimes it is found as grey as pumicestone and of the same thick texture and this is the richest sort Within the cells of this ore the foliaceous substance of which seems to be of a quartzlike nature a great deal of golddust as if powdered lies so loose that if the stone was broke it might be shaken out Of all goldores this is in proportion to it's weight the richest and the golddust may be plainly seen in it and washed out without any other trouble and thirtysix pounds of this ore will yield from two to six drachms of pure golddust It is to be lamented that it is not found very abundantly in lumps or nests Among the same ore I found some consisting of a coarse texture here and there flowing together in genuine quartz and exactly resembling wormeaten quartz and among the spungy substances some pieces contain instead of gold small particles of blinde or mocklead  But the common brown blackish ore is in some places of a very similar light spungy texture and it's spungy parts overrun with leadcolour but neverthe∣less of goldalloy This ore breaks away in small regular cubic pieces like dice of a spungy substance a rustbrown colour internally but hard and shining on the surface and each of their six sides is slightly fur∣rowed with parallel lines but so that the sides in con∣tact have their lines always athwart or across each other  whereas the lines of the opposite sides lie in a similar position These dice break away readily from the ore and are found from one quarter of an inch and less to two but seldom three inches large I saw some the rind of which or even part of the whole dice resem∣bled a waterpebble Sometimes streaks of goldore are observable on their surface and golddust in their substance  Besides these quartzsubstances there is found in the goldstreaks topazes of various goodness and value either single or in clusters They are sometimes se∣veral inches thick in sexagonal chrystals the points of which are obliquely clipped which are either transpa∣rent as water smokecoloured and more or less dark In the engineshaft of the mine of Kljutschesskoi there is said to lie an enormous mass of topazes which could not be got at on account of the water but I saw some considerable sherds knocked off with breakers which appeared very clear and beautiful They sometimes dig in the goldstreaks plenty of waterpebbles ly∣ing in quartz and sometimes forming dice and also a tincoloured radiant quartzlike substance  Besides the goldstreaks there are in the mines of Beresofkoi some copper lead and silverstreaks which though divided from the goldore run quite close to it They also dig in these mines a number of waterpebbles overshot with an excellent darkblue  lazuli and also a remarkable leadspar which never has been found in any other mine of this or any other country and of which the ingenious and learned Mr  Lekmann  has written a treatise This spar is heavy demitransparent sometimes varicoloured sometimes of a cinnabared and found in great small short and long chrystals in the clefts of quartz and also in the sand stony matrixes and in places where the space would allow it in a flat cubic prismatic figure with unequal truncated twosided ends Sometimes it is found on quartz in short oblique and irregular pyra∣mids like little rubies If bruised it makes a fine highyellow fermentation that may be used in minia∣ture painting After all the experiments made in the physical laboratory at Catherineburg they have ex∣tracted from it a rich alloy of lead amounting to half the substance and a very small quantity of silver  There is also found in these mixt quartzstreaks wherein this rare mineral is brought forth some little oblong chrystals pointed at both ends of a sulphuryellow colour resembling massive sulphur and taken as such by the miners but it will not burn in fire nor burst in flame like the red leadspar This little chrystalization is found both upon quartz and sandstone  In all these mines they employ miners which are scarce sufficient in winter when the works are mostly  going Many more hands are required for selecting and separating the ores which is done not in the mine but above with hammers and in this work some thousands of peasants are employed who work for their polltax and according to their age and capacity earn from three to six copeeks a day These cannot complain against their master's oppressive conduct a great number perish by the scurvy and most return home sick and heartbroken They are only employed when they have no husbandry to engage them of course assistance is most wanted in summertime when there is most work to do The ore which is se∣parated as much as possible from the substance it is connected with is divided into three sorts and sent to the stampmills where it produces from forty pounds to half a pound of pure golddust in every puds of ore In these mines are annually dug puds of ore the best of which produces a tenth part of the whole and the three lavatories or washinghouses extract annually from five to seven puds of pure golddust each pud thirtysix pounds English  On the th of June I returned to Catherineburgh and set out the next day for Newjanskoi a distance of fortyeight miles to see the oldest ironmanufactory in all Siberia and which has been in constant work since the year where there is a wooden church with a stonebuilt steeple feet high with harmo∣nious chimes an oldfashioned but fine and spacious  stonebuilt house with wings in which the proprietor lives and many other buildings Near the steeple stands a great castiron column as a monument erect∣ed to the founder of these works In a circumference of about six miles here are dwellings and only inhabitants the chief of them old faithful ser∣vants and substantial people Through the streets run little canals with a number of bridges over them In these streets are many shops where all sorts of iron and copperware are sold Here is a foundery and two high furnaces one of which is twenty ells high and has four double bellows and can cast puds of raw iron in twentyfour hours which is the largest furnace in the whole Russian empire near it are two hammers under which the ironstone is broke and carried in pails to the high furnace where it is wound up into it a barforge with a hammer and another where the large instruments here used are made a building with two barhammers another with four two others with three each an anchorforge a waterbellows and three others a mechanical contrivance to draw out iron between rollers and plate it sundry large hearths to heat iron several tin working places another bar∣forge where are four barhammers a sawmill a cornmill a polishingmill where they polish bells and ironware a house where bells are cast two build∣ings for tinning ironplates one where coppervessels are made one for forging mineinstruments and tools and twentyfour forges where all sorts of ironware is  made as kettles pots pans c and most of these works are worked by water It is a delightful sight to see boys ten or twelve years old working with their parents and earning a good salary There is also here an old wirefactory a new place for locksmiths and sundry other erections all surrounded with a fortifica∣tion  This manufactory was founded by  Akimfi Demidovf  a counsellor of state and remained in that family till it was sold to the assessor  Sawa Jakowlef Sabakin  it ma∣nufactures annually puds of bariron besides a vast quantity of all sorts of ironware The propri∣etor of these works is the sole proprietor of many others nearly as capital in the neighbourhood  There are many more iron and copper manufacto∣ries in this district some whose works are more ex∣tensive than others all of which Dr  Pallas  visited but as they are all upon a similar plan it will be tiresome to an English reader to repeat them and on this consideration we will pass them over  At one of these manufactories is a kind of beautiful Siberian cedartrees or cedarfirs which have been planted upwards of forty years and are only five inches diameter in their trunk but have born fruit many years This year they bore no fruit and the peasants told me that their bearing is periodical but I could  not learn what this period was some said every fourth or fifth year others every tenth year so that I could not credit the assertion This tree thrives best in the pathless mires of the mountains and I am of opinion that it's fruiting depends much on the moistness of the weather for proceeding farther in the country I found that even in the present barren year these trees in the most watry places bore the most fruit and that it requires two wet years together to make them bear well Of all inland resintrees none not even the larch grows so slow as the cedarpine from hence one would conclude it must surpass every other tree of it's genus in hardness and solidity of wood and in beau∣ty of growth and appearance But notwithstanding this it is most certain that the wood of the cedarfir if compared with that of other firs and larches is soft and perishable but in appearance colour veins and lightness it is similar to the pine and of course must be excellent for joiners use and there are trunks to be met with in the mountains from which planks might be cut more than two ells in breadth and I think they would make excellent masts There is no tree that can be imagined of more beautiful growth than the old cedars of this kind no eye being able to deter∣mine the loftiness of their tops The best idea of it's growth will be formed when I say that upon a young tree the trunk of which was five Paris inches and four lines in diameter I counted sixty rings or marks of annual growth the diameter of these of the  fiifth and sixth year were only one and onethird of a line and those of younger growth were no more in diameter than the thickness of a piece of paper four times folded  How many years old then must such a tree be and how lofty whose diameter is more than two ells  I saw also a larchtree there only five inches nine lines in diameter though by it's rings it was fiftynine years old  From the manufactory of Newjanskoi we had in sight the abestos mountain which I determined to see I accordingly rode there during a continual rain and was wet to the skin it being at the distance of six miles It is a long steep narrow rocky tract rising in the middle of a wood and the number of it's pits and openings made it dangerous to ride on however I made shift to reach it's summit and found it consisted of a hard loamy chertz the layers of which fall into it's depth under an angle of fiftyfour degrees from north to south and is chiefly dug up in pieces like a cuboides or trapezoides within the layer of this hard rock is interspersed a great deal of greenish amianthus which in the mountain remains firm and indissoluble but by decomposition splits into stiff bristles Near this amianthus lies generally a fine silklike asbestos indeed the natives call it in their language the silkmountain of a yellowishgreen colour uncommonly glittering it's threads running in a perpendicular di∣rection There was formerly a woman in Newjanskoi  who had the art of weaving this asbestos into incom∣bustable linen and gloves and also made paper of it  I am told that in India they make sheets of it in which they burn the dead and thus collect the ashes by unfolding the sheet again when cold Linen made of this mineral will burn clean in an oven like to∣baccopipe clay  However hard and difficult it is to dig it yet it's flexible fibres may be rubbed into a soft and silken wool which can be twisted into a thread and woven by means of oil and be afterwards cleaned from any oiliness by fire But as the whole seemed to have no other object in view than to gratify human curiosity those who opened the pits left off working them and it is scarcely existing in remembrance  Before I leave Newjanskoi I must not omit to men∣tion two manufactories that have rendered this place fa∣mous in Siberia and do honour to the memory of  Demidorf  One is for the making of frames and wheels two articles very much sold here and made of fieldbirch having no oak in this country It is indeed curious to the mind of a naturalist and worthy to be remarked how far this fieldbirch is superior to forestbirch in hardness and solidity of wood I weighed a cubical piece of each exactly of the same size and found the wood of fieldbirch two seventeenths heavier than that of forestbirch Such a difference may be felt with the hand The wood of the former when dry even surpasses the oak The second manufactory  is that of varnishing and japaning copper and iron teavessels wooden bowls waiters ctc This is a very profitable branch of business There is some part of this furniture to be seen which rivals the varnish of the Chinese and almost surpasses the French except in paintings The method they use is kept a secret among the workmen and they take no apprentices un∣less they are well paid but I know from authority that the whole secret consists in common linseedoil boiled thick and blackened with woodsoot They let the oil stand some time in a hot oven in order to mix it well with the soot and lay it thin over their work with their fingers but do this eight or ten times suc∣cessively and after every time set it to dry in a hot oven the finer and thicker the varnish or japaning is wanted the oftener it is to be done over In order to put on the ornaments they cut out flowers fruits and landscapes in paper lay these figures on the varnish cover them with goldcolour and then with the clear linseed oil again without the soot several times dry∣ing the vessel each time as before  My next visit was to a tannery where having no oak they use willowbark and the inner brown birchrind but they prefer the former and it takes a chord and a half to tan ten hides I was also informed that the purest and most odoriferous birchoil which is almost as clear as linseedoil is chiefly used to soak the skins and this oil is drawn from such pure white birchrinds  as are taken from old birches partly rotten at the root so that there remains little but the outward oily bark All the oil burnt from fresh birchrinds to which a great deal of the black bark substance adheres is generally very impure with soot and very unfit for tan∣ning It is a wrong notion to suppose any wild rose∣mary or other bush is burnt with the birch to give it a fragrancy the purer and cleaner the birchrinds are the more fragrant will be the oil without any other ad∣dition  In my way on I could not but take notice with asto∣nishment that the horses we had with us being hun∣gry and towards night wherever they met a helle∣bore plant  Veratrum  which was not yet in bloom stooped and eat it greedily The drivers of our waggons assured me that their horses eat this plant in spring without the least hurt and though it was hurtful to cattle in other places it had no other effect on theirs than sometimes to purge them gently Some country people fond of chattering who accompanied us from Newjanskoi made us spend the night very agreeably in discoursing on the strength and efficacy of wild herbs and plants one of whom seemed to possess an uncommon knowledge He praised the Greek vale∣rian  Polemonium  as efficacious against the falling sick∣ness and called it  Troizwetki  threecoloured flower the sagetree  Phlomis tuberosa  as a remedy against swelling of the glands in the groin the aconite  aco∣nitum  lycoctonum  against singing or hissing in the head the devil's bit  Succifa  which grows very tall as high as a man's head and which he called  pupownick  navelwort he said was a sure remedy in pains of the belly somnolency and giddiness of head But his greatest secrets this country doctor seemed unwilling to reveal however with much persuasion and a good reward he communicated the following which high∣ly absurd as they are I will give my readers for their entertainment The root of the skyflower  Cinera∣ria Sibirica  which grows in all the marshy woods and consists of many thick threads under which name the marshmarygold  Caltha  is also known among the countryfolks as a domestic remedy he declared would bring a man dead drunk to himself and quite sober him provided he drank no strong liquor the day he took the medicine and that he had often tried it His second secret most pernicious to health is said to be in use and fashion among the common women in Russia and Siberia this is to prevent pregnancy by taking a certain dose of ceruse or whitelead which is used as a paint at a time a woman expects her menstru∣al courses which checks them and destroys concepti∣on It may answer the purpose but the effect will certainly cease as soon as she leaves off this dangerous remedy  About twentyeight miles from Newjanskoi I reach∣ed on the st of July the ironmanufactory of Inshno  Tagilskoi where all sorts of ironwork are made by watermills also joinery and turner's work In this town there is a beautiful stonebuilt church with a fine cupola and lofty steeple having a complete ring of bells and harmonious chimes The whole edifice is covered with ironplates and divided into a summer and winterchurch embellished with the highest degree of splendor and a variety of precious ornaments Among the curiosities of this place are two enormous cubical magnets which form the altars of each church the one is five yards high four and a half broad and almost as thick the other seven yards high and five yards broad and thick much penetrated with verdi∣grease They began to build this church in Here are also a court of Justice a comptoir a fine wooden mansion for the proprietor a foundling hospi∣tal a drawingschool several neat apartments for the reception of strangers and houses The male inhabitants are but they are all slaves except Among them are many excellent workmen and the proprietor may boast that if there is any manufac∣tory well supported with clever people it is his  The great blessing of this manufactory is a magnetmountain within a mile of the place added to a rich ironstone soil all round covered with timber This mountain was discovered in the year by the Wogulians and was opened in The manufac∣tory was established here in consequence of it The  mountain extends itself from north to south yet is in the whole conical steep and it's perpendicular height about forty fathoms or feet It is full of ironore lb of which yield lb of fine pure iron The magnets which are here found abundantly are chiefly among the meanest iron about thirty fathoms deep and in their clefts overshot with verdigrease  The mountain is at present divided into three dif∣ferent manufactories those of Tagilskoi Newjanskoi and Rewdinskoi Since the establishment of the ma∣nufactory of Tagilskoi it has dug many millions of puds for it's share and a great deal from the bottom of the mountain They continue the works with great regularity in the form of streets and having taken off the upper ore the under is easily dug and they em∣ploy three or four hundred little boys and girls who earn three copeeks or three halfpence a day each be∣sides men The ore is collected in large heaps curiously underlaid with timber so as to burn fired and roasted on the spot Such a heap will contain puds of ore will often burn forty days and require eight or ten weeks to get cold again The ore is rendered fluid by this strong burning and is knocked in pieces with shorthelved hammers The whole mountain is covered with firs and birches and at it's marshy bottom grow young cedars carefully hedged in  I left Tagilskoi in a delightful serene night to visit other manufactories that lie more to the northward down the river Tagil and passed an intrenchment said to be thrown up by  Jermak Timofejef  who is generally known to have been the first conqueror of Siberia and who after penetrating the country from the Tschus∣sowaja into the Serebrjanka as far as the brook Kokui is said to have erected here wintertents but after he had marched over the mountains to the Tagil halted and threw up this intrenchment resting here in order to build new vessels There however is nothing to be seen but a rectangular ditch two fathoms broad constructed on an elevated cape scarce five fathoms from the river It's northern flank is fourteen fathoms long and it's eastern not much above ten with two or three caves or subterranean dwellings within  A few miles from this is a coppermine and also an iron one and a manufactory established near them now belonging to the crown The number of houses is not very great and the works are performed by peasants who labour for their polltax But three neighbouring towns are obliged to send people who are employed in felling of wood burning of coal digging c as the manufacturers cannot be spared for such kind of labour  Adjoining is a mountain full of ironore with a summerhouse on the top to which I went on the d  of July to see the prospect which was extensive and beautiful commanding the view of many mountains and the course of the Ural at about fifteen miles dis∣stance This mountain produces annually puds of ironstone and yet this quantity is considered as very trifling  Of all the Siberian manufactories Kuschwinskoi is the first where agriculture has taken place By the laudable regulations of Assessor  Alexey Moskwin  the inhabitants for some years have grown their own wheat and the crops here were very promising not∣withstanding the cold woody and mountainous situa∣tion of this district About the Kuschwa the cedars begin to be very abundant and the forests on the un∣inhabited mountain full of wild animals Sables are seldom caught here alive as the peasants take them quite young from their nests but there is plenty of boars hyaenas and wolves They catch here a great many striped groundsquirrels which dwell every where throughout the fir pine and cedarwoods and chiefly live on the seeds of trees they climb the trees but make holes and provisionchambers in the ground in which they lie in winter carrying thither by means of the bags in their cheeks all sorts of seeds Notwith∣standing the beauty of their furs and they might easily be caught by children they care little about them This animal is to met with in summertime in all the resinwoods from the Kama throughout Siberia and is a prey to sables and other species of weasels  During winter they hide themselves in holes under∣ground live there on the provisions they collect in sum∣mer and though covered with deep snow are never benumbed by the cold or thrown into a torpid state as the marmottes The mole is common in this district and remarkable for it's uncommon great size and sometimes for it's snowy whiteness  The roads in this country are in some places very passable in others almost impassable Round the manufactories they are kept in repair and bridges are thrown over the rivers in other places they are to be crossed only by fording or on rafts Dr  Pallas  rode chiefly on horseback his baggage following him or meeting him at certain places sometimes in waggons and sometimes on packhorses  The Siberian plough which is here used and throughout Siberia is without wheels like the Rus∣sian and has only a cross pole with handles a pair of shafts within which the horse walks and a bent ploughhandle fixed before with a double or single coulter It is a heavy instrument and far from a con∣venient one They use the Finland harrow as being strong and fit for stony ground Husbandmen in winter are chiefly employed in hunting sables and martens with snowshoes and terrier dogs and commonly shoot them with balls and blunt arrows from trees Hunt∣ing the sable is more difficult than that of the marten  which as soon as pursued by the hounds climbs up a tree and is easily killed but the sable runs for it and endeavours to deceive his pursuers like a hare and at last when he sees no other refuge takes to the trees and there meets his destruction  In my journey I arrived on the th of July at a place called Jelkina settled by Woguls on both sides of the Tura These people neither practise husbandry nor breeding of cattle but live merely by hunting In other respects they perfectly imitate the Russians in their habitations dress and way of living and ra∣ther make use of the Russian language than their own indeed they seem ashamed to speak their mother∣tongue before a Russian They have for many years been converted to the Greek church but yet remain very dull and ignorant christians I changed horses here but had some difficulty to do it as some of the inhabitants keep only one horse between two and took with me some guides to shew me the places where they dig jasper and varicoloured marble Close to this place I was obliged to ford the river Iss called in Wogul language  Ass  and soon after having crossed a lofty mountain rode through a tract along the river Tura where the grass stood so high as to pass over the horse and it's rider When we reached the marble∣quarry it became dark but as the spot was dry I re∣solved to spend the night here which was very serene and of course we had no covering but the vaulted  sky yet as the night was frosty and we were exposed to the wild boars it was necessary to light a fire which our Wogulians did with uncommon agility not with brimstone for it's vapour and smoke is apt to drive a∣way wild animals to a great distance and injurious to to the hunter but they carry with them a handful or two of that soft faded grass which the rivers throw out dried in their bosom lay the kindled birchspunk upon it which is a kind of fungous that grows on the birch tree and holds fire and lift it towards the wind or blow it with their mouth till it flames The Russians have adopted the same and call the grass  Puischekcha  Rising in the morning from my airy couch I con∣sulted my guides and they led me through a marshy pinewood where the trees were so thick and the ground so miry that our cloaths were torn our faces scratched and our horses every now and then up to the saddle in mire There was no plant to be seen here except the mountain chickweed  Moehringia  and  Linnaea  which I often cursed in this district it's bloom being always here a token of most impervious mires and impenetrable pinewoods  In this unpleasant situation I rode the whole forenoon and at last past with a great deal of trouble two miry brooks and came into a woody tract burnt out to the distance of some miles square where a tempest or as  the Woguls call it an evil spirit had raged in such a manner that it could not have looked more terrible had it been done by an enemy but the worst was that we lost our path among the felled trees that laid a∣cross the road and the swampy mire that scarce had a bottom yet the Woguls trusted to their geographical knowledge and were convinced they should find the right path through this wilderness Not disposed to return back I allighted and led my horse by the bri∣dle skipping and jumping over the trees and some∣times up to my knees in mire but as there was no danger of breaking our necks or bones we continued wandering through this wood with axes in our hands clearing a way before us for a mile and a half At last the courage and strength of my whole retinue of Wo∣guls and soldiers left them this obliged me to halt and I sent two Woguls on before to see whether they could find away out but they came back frightened at the scream of an owl which they heard without doing what I ordered them At last they confessed they had not passed through this forest for many years and that they were entirely ignorant of it's extent and situation Necessity therefore obliged us to go back and we crossed the Tura where the water came up to our sad∣dles and at last got to a village quite spent by this miry expedition  The forest along the Tura has here and there some cedars and a great number of tall larches where  I met with the gum of old burnt trunks which I have mentioned On one tree I found a peculiar kind of gum and on it's rind a sort of turpentine resin but on all other young wood I could only meet with the re∣sin The Woguls gather this gum and use it as glue or chew it on account of it's sweetish taste as a denti∣frice for cleaning and preserving their teeth In this they are like the Greek girls who chew mastick for for the same purpose  Next morning I proceeded on my journey and cross∣ed the Tura again and passed two little villages Every one was now busy making hay at which the wo∣men and girls made a great parade On account of the flies and gnats which are very troublesome each takes with them a pot full of lighted birch spunks or foul wood which is rotten like touchwood fastened on a board in order to prevent their cloaths from catching fire They prefer the smoke of birchspunks in their houses here as it drives away the insects and does not hurt their eyes Without this smoke there would be no rest in these woody and northern districts They kindle also such things and create a smoke in their yards to which the cattle repair at night in order to be free from the torture of the flies as at this time it rains almost every day and the cut grass cannot get thoroughly dry on the ground they do not make it in∣to cocks but in long small walls erected between wooden poles stuck in the ground or run across in such  walls the wet hay gets dry presently and does not heat Their scythes are like most Siberian ones Their form is like a long narrow and bent knife fastened on a crooked club with which the mower at each step cuts to the right and left by swinging the club about in his hands  Going on we saw an impending hailstorm before us and I had just time to have a felttent raised to save us from the wet In our way to another ironma∣nufactory we had to pass such a wood as that in which we were lately lost The horses sunk every now and then up to their breasts in mire and though we went very slowly on were every moment in danger of being overthrown or losing our eyes by the projecting pinebranches The proprietor leaves the road in this bad condition for political reasons to deprive search∣ers of ore or inquisitive travellers from coming to his mines Some of the horse and sootpaths are laid with birch timber and may be rode on with pleasure and suchlike roads might be made throughout the forest at a little expence but he took care to leave the most miry spots where the mud is almost bottomless with∣out any improvement It is in these very soft marshy places that pines poplars and cedarfirs grow best and most handsome particularly where the mine is bottom∣less In this forest I found the spurge laurel  Daph∣ne Mezereum  the red berries of which are here known by the name of wild pepper The berries are used for  different purposes internally as an emetick for coughs in children and externally to rub the cheeks with in the bath which become red as if inflamed by the sharpness of the juice so that the lower class of women use it as paint The kernels of the berries are bruised and taken by the peasants as a purge a proof that their intestines cannot be sound The root which is sharper than the plant is used as a remedy for the toothach  Woodcocks hares and sables are here caught by means of traps called  Slopezi  which to break off a tedious narrative I shall here describe A spot is chosen where the pines do not grow thick and where two young trees stand at about seventeen feet from each other From these trees they cut off all the lower branches Near one of these pines a pale or post about eight feet high is driven into the ground To this they fasten a pinepole horizontally so that one end shall be fixed to one tree and the opposite end be∣tween the post and the other tree Over this pole they fasten another as a beam almost parallel with it so loosely fixed to one tree at one end that the other may be moved up and down between the post and the other tree which is hewn smooth where the beam falls This end of the beam is raised by a slight lifter sup∣ported in a notch at the top of the post and it's end brought down by a piece of bast to the lower beam where it is fastened with a woodcock or a piece of  meat by way of bait so as that when the bait is moved the lifter loses it's hold and the upperbeam falls down on the sable or marten creeping on the lowerbeam and catching at the bait and thus kills it with it's weight  Having inspected all the mines and mountains in this district I will now give my readers some account of the Woguls who inhabit the forests on the northern side of mount Ural and are settled about the brook Targa where I was on the th of July and took up my night's lodging among them The Woguls inha∣bit these forests in single families and each family reckons it's distance and claims the land of the adjacent neighbourhood as far as they can reach in hunting Having no other resource to live on necessity keeps them at as a great a distance from each other as possi∣ble for were they to live together in villages th  y would not be able to find sufficient game for their sub∣sistance Though most of them acquire a handsome property by catching of sables and other animals yet they keep no horses partly because they have no pas∣ture for them are unable to secure them from the bears and partly because they can better pursue their game in these pathless and marshy forests on foot The richest among them keep a few cows which always re∣main with the women near the huts and these are all the domestic animals they have except a few dogs and of these a very few Yet nature has assigned them a suffi∣cient  property in the beasts of the forests The elks are their chief subsistence Each family of Woguls makes an enclosure in it's district on some commodi∣ous spot which often extends to a distance of seven nine or more miles through the solitary forest fenced in with pales made of split firs and pines They are very careful of these enclosures and will not suffer any one to make hay fell wood or take the game within them At certain distances these enclosures have openings provided with pits and springbows that kill the game as soon as the bait is touched and catch whatever passes through It frequently happens that they catch in these pits female elks and their young ones and sometimes reindeer though such are very scarce in this district Their meat which they never eat fresh is cut out into long slices and dryed without salt either in smoke or in the air This is their usual food which they eat either boiled or dry out of their hands Should they have the ill luck not to catch any game for a long time and should their provision be con∣sumed they break the elkbones which are laid aside boil them in water and make with them a kind of broth But they are seldom reduced to this necessity for besides bows and arrows and guns with which most are provided they catch wood and water fowl and those that live near a river fish with nets and baskets and for this purpose make boats of hollow trees like the Russians or with birchrinds in their own way sewing them together with elksinews and  tarring them They know of no other meat except cedarnuts and berries which grow in the marshes Notwithstanding this they are healthy and have not the least symptom of scurvy though living in a swampy and cold woody climate They are ignorant of the use of plants and domestic remedies perhaps eating no salt and being accustomed to the climate may con∣tribute not a little to their health yet they seldom reach an old age They are fond of purchasing from the Russians flour all sorts of things baked and strong liquor They barter with the Russians skins for cloaths so that they are entirely ignorant of tanning They work indeed elks claws with their hands and the fat of boiled fish till they become soft and of these they make gloves They also convert the skin of the elk into long snowshoes or skates like the Lap∣landers with which they hunt in winter gluing the wet skin upon them either with larchtree gum or some other glue prepared by them from reindeer blood and flour or elkhorn powder which mixed is to stand one night in a warm oven  The Woguls are generally a short people femi∣nine and have something in their faces resembling the Kalmucks except that their complexions are whiter their faces are commonly round and the women whose favourite passion is love are highly voluptuous Their hair is generally long black or darkbrown few men  only have a thin reddish beard and lightcoloured hair  The womens' dress consists in white uppershifts made of coarse linen which reach to the ground and are tied round the waist They hang a cloth worked with the needle over their head hanging down the back under which is tied round the forehead a black frontlet decorated with beads Their shoes are made of the bark of trees Girls go bareheaded wearing their hair according to the present Russian fashion braided into tresses  In winter the women wrap themselves up in skins like the men  They have adopted many of the Russian manners even to their dances Their own consist in short moti∣ons of their feet set close together and two persons dancing make little steps to the music in opposite cir∣cles so that one turns his back to the other holding a handkerchief between them using impassioned ges∣tures and expressive movements The musical instru∣ment they use for this purpose is a kind of harp in form of a little boat called by them  Schongourt  strung with six gutstrings twisted at one end round a piece of cross wood and tuned by other little slips of wood The player takes this instrument on his knee beats the base with his lefthand and the treble with his right Their melody is simple but harmoni∣ous and in the Tartarian taste The Woguls are of  Finnish origin and their language as far as I could see by a dictionary made therefrom is similar to that of Finland But they have many different dialects among them and even the pronunciation with many of the expressions of the Woguls in the environs of the Soswa are already distinguishable from that of the Woguls about the Tura  The winterhuts of this people are square and made of timber with a flat roof in which they make an open∣ing to let in the light with a doorway to the north or east On the left from the door in the middle of the sidewall stands a low oven and near it a chimney over which the smoke goes out and the light comes in Opposite the oven is a broad bench for sleeping on and against the southwall a bench to sit on They have commonly a little vestibule to this hut in which stands all sorts of houshold furniture and vessels these consist mostly of troughs and barrels of hollowed birchtrunks or birchbark which they use for a hun∣dred little necessaries Of the birchbark they make drinking and eatingvessels and the women make ob∣long cradles of it which are little more than boxes and suspend their children in them within the hut or car∣ry them on their backs Of the upper fine birchbark they make smart little boxes by boiling and cleansing it sewing the parts together with sinews and embel∣lishing them with fine shavings of wood and in these they keep their needlework In summertime they  BASKIRIANS A TARTARIAN TEMPLE THE WHITE CRANES  are seldom to be found in these habitations but live in open huts marde of birchbark  Balagani  before which they keep a continual fire to keep off the flies and horsestingers which are almost insupportable in these districts  'Some authors' says  Tooke  pretend that these Woguls are the brethren of the present Hungarians and found their conjecture on the situation of the Wogul territory and the striking resemblance there is between the language of the two nations This peo∣ple was subjected to the dominion of Russia at the same time with Siberia  The Woguls Christians as well as Pagans pur∣chase their wives and the latter have often two at a time A tolerably handsome one may be bought for the value of five rubles and those who cannot afford this endeavour to steal a wife Marriage takes place without any ceremony the young man pays the price takes the girl to his hut and goes to bed to her and the next day she is his wife A lyingin woman is held to be impure for the first six weeks all which time she remains alone The first comer gives a name to the newborn child without any other cere∣mony  Their burialplaces are in the woods They dress the deceased put him between four boards and lay  him with his head to the north The grave they call  Vanka  and in it they lay a bow arrows and other implements without any other form  I could obtain no accurate or positive account re∣specting their ancient religious opinions because they obstinately deny the superstitions wherewith they are still infected and call themselves Christians It is cer∣tain however that they still persist in their ancient idolatry worshiping several idols and particularly for the sake of hunting It is said that they call on dif∣ferent idols for elkhunting sablehunting c and even bring offerings to the images of these animals There is an elkcalf  Wolenn  roughly carved in stone near the habitation of the rich Wogul Denisch∣kin upon the Soswa of which they relate many ficti∣tious stories about it's being petrified Over it they have built a hut to which the Woguls repair from the most distant parts in order to obtain a lucky huntingday by their prayers and little offerings They have also idols of human shape some of them are carved in wood and have shot or coralbeads instead of eyes About a year since some oresearchers found in a tract of wood between the Soswa and the Loswa on a high pine a cast brazen image of a human form with a hunting lance and this certainly was a Wogul idol Before they were converted they used to place their idols on steep rockwalls in rockcaverns or on high pines that their worship might excite a sacred awe  Near the Loswa just above the brook Schaïtanka is a cavern in a chalkmountain renowned to this day for being a temple or sanctuary of the Woguls Se∣veral bones of victims and sometimes little images copperrings with carved figures c have been found in it which the Woguls purchase from the Russians and secretly adore as idols Numberless brooks mountains and places are called in this part of Siberia  Schaïtanka  or  Ichaïtanskaja  because the Woguls held there their idolatrous worship and their idols and are called indiscriminately by the Russ inhabitants  Scha∣ïtan  or the Devil  'Torim'  says  Tooke  is a divinity under whose symbol they convey the idea of a universal god the merciful Sovereign of the world They have divers deities inferior to him and in subordination and dis∣tinguish them by various names The sun they con∣ceive to be the abode of Torim but that orb itself is with them a divinity as is the moon the clouds and principal phaenomena of nature The Devil whom they call  Koul  is with them of very little consequence they consider him as a contemptible being and scarce bestow a thought on him  The chief festival of the Woguls is called  Yelbola  and held at the commencement of the year which is at Easter and the feast is said to be that at which God descends upon the earth by which they mean  the return of spring Another festival is  Cenkobo  celebrated on the second new moon after Yelbola At these festivals they sacrifice victims either a horse cow sheep goat or wildfowl Sacrifices for the sick everyone performs at home  On the d of July I visited another magnet moun∣tain that which lies near the river Iss The magnets here are mixed with grey blinde and are often found of many puds weight I saw magnets of seven pounds that would lift and bear above thirtysix pounds weight small magnets that would raise twenty or twentyfive times their own weight have been found here  On my return to Newjanskoi and not far from that manufactory I met again with that beautiful redlead spar which I saw in the goldmines and which has never been seen in any other corner of the world and had now an opportunity of finding out the quantity of lead it contained I made an assay and found that lb would produce about fortythree pounds of lead and about one grain of silver whereas the raw clay from which the spar was dug yielded but six pounds of lead per cwt  August    There is nothing further in our Author's travels that would entertain our readers or be any ways useful to them till he arrived at  Troiz∣kaja Krepost  on the th of August  This is a fort  lying on the left of the river Ui which springs from the Ural not far from the sources of the Jaik The Uwelka unites with the Ui about three quarters of a mile from the fort and is much broader than the lat∣ter which here does not exceed seven or eight fathoms This place where the chief officers and men of the line reside is pretty enough it is built in a square form with bastions in the angles of it's wooden wall and rave∣lins also four towers with gafes upon the flanks besides a ditch chevauxdefrize and competent ordnance Of public buildings there is a fine stonebuilt church a wooden church a mansion for the general and sundry pretty buildings in which the several officers live The rest of the houses are not in good condition ex∣cept that of the customhousedirector and some new dwellings belonging to merchants All the houses which amount to some hundreds are built in regular streets and the name of each street wrote on the corner in black tablets Here is a bridge over the Ui whose opposite side belonging to the Kirguese has a wellbuilt market where trade flourishes with the Asiaticks It is an extensive square built of wood divided into a piazza and Bucharian marketplace on the left an∣other on the right for the natives and a large place encompassed with great booths for the trade of the Kirguese besides some bastions and a wooden watchtower which commands a view over the Kirguisian step It is also fortified with chevauxdefrize and on three sides from the river surrounded with ditches  About the river are inns built with wood and eatinghouses for the trading people and merchants  I can say little about the trade here which has been reckoned more extensive and advantageous than that of Orenburg there having for a year past been a mis∣understanding between the whole horde of the Kir∣guese who inhabit the neighbouring step and come here to trade which misunderstanding has not only estranged them from these boundaries but also deter∣mined them to render the road of the Asiatic cara∣vans to this place unsafe and it is but a few weeks since they sent a detatchment of regular lighthorse in∣to the step which went a great way without getting a sight of a single Kirguisian so that a reconciliation with this people is not soon to be expected  During my stay here the chief of the horde called  Ablai Sultan  sent some deputies but their proposals and pretensions were so excessive as not to be granted Here is a strong garrison of Baskirians and a report of warlike preparations has made the Kirguisian warriors so shy that there is none to be seen in the whole step as far as the mountains This has been confirmed by merchants who travelled from thence and who were so lucky as not to meet a single Kirguisian but an∣other caravan arriving soon after had not the same good fortune but was stopped and detained by the Kirguese till late in autumn  As far as I could learn most of the caravans come here from Taschkent There are but few Bucharians and those of Chewinzka are seldom to be met with The goods brought by the caravans are spun and new cotton coarse and fine cottonstuff callico of dif∣ferent qualities of which that of Taschkent is the best they seldom bring India ones Cotton and silkgirdles printed cottoncurtains tablecloths and shirts a kind of bad velvet curled and striped lambskins Turkey wormseed and dried fruits also Chinese silver and Bucharian or Persian goldcoins The goods they carry back are red and scarlet cloths foreign velvet camblets manufactured about the Jaik all sorts of light furs of different goodness furs of the Wolgamusk sewed together otter and beaverfurs for trimmings Russianhides black and red of small wares ironlocks needles varicoloured glassbeads loaves of sugar paper and colours as allum vitriol cochi∣neal brazil indigo orpiment ceruse common pa∣per c c  The trade here with the Asiatic merchants is in general less than at Orenburg and the goods brought here are of less value but the bartertrade with the Kirguisian Cossacks of the middle horde is far greater and of more consequence These latter are not so much versed in trade as the Kirguese of the little horde who trade at Orenburg their horses and the rest of their cattle are better and the merchants here esta∣blished  gain on both sides and add to this that all Kirguisian cattle are cheaper at Troizkoi than at Oren∣burg Oxen are more plentiful in this horde and therefore bought here in great numbers and there are large and handsome bullocks among them Horses here are larger and stronger but as wild and untamed as those of the little horde Sheep and goats are of the same form and nature besides these the Kirguese bring furs of wolves red foxes stepfoxes and little groundfoxes lamb sheep and oxen skins coarse camelshair coltskins hairlines c c  In order to give the reader some idea of the luxury of these Asiatic nomades and to shew their wants I will add here a list of all wares and toys which the merchants of this realm barter with them at a great price and for which they receive cattle furs and Chinese silver which the Kirguese get by their cattletrade These goods are scarlet and red cloths from the finest sort to the soldier's coat camblets manufac∣tured in the country about the Jaik calimancoes white and particoloured stuffs napkincloth Chinese cot∣tonstuffs nankeen Chinese and foreign velvets old and new furs covered with silk and halfsilk stuffs good fox otter and beaverfurs for bordering of caps thin silk cloaths striped and figured linens for cloaths cotton and silkgirdles of Astrachan hides and cordo∣vans all sorts of female ornaments tresses tassels fringes breastpendants turned and polished glassbeads  pearls a kind of snailshells called  Serpentheads  lookingglasses combs razors needles silkyarn and silkthread ceruse rouge all sorts of ironwares as cast and hammered boilers ladles trevets chains horseharness locks padlocks irontraps axes knives of all sorts sizars firesteels buckles iron copper and tinbuttons funnels needlecases snuffboxes pipes tobacco horncases also copper and tinware raw and in plates ironwire tinvessels varnished and common cups little trunks with ironbands carts and waggons materials for dying as al∣lum vitriol redwax sealingwax pitch groats ryebread and wheat common tea hay c All these articles being mostly inland goods are sold at a consi∣derable price to the Kirguese and make a commer∣cial intercourse with that nation very important  It being well authenticated that the adjacent districts of the step were free from Kirguese I would not neg∣lect the opportunity of viewing some remarkable places there I therefore went on the th of August to a Koschena or Tartarian temple kept sacred both by the Kirguese and Baskirians and situated in the mid∣dle of the desart upon a little river which flows into the Ui about seventyfive miles from this place My escort consisted of twenty Cossacks from the district of the river Ui and eighty Baskirians Mestscheraks and Tartars with the Baskirian Starchin Schoker Hav∣ing travelled unmolested the whole day I ordered my  tent to be erected in the evening and slept quietly on the step The night was gloomy yet without dew and the next morning was fine and serene The day after we reached the Tartarian temple to see which I undertook the journey It stands on an elevated open level ground in perfect good condition and the woodenwork within shews that it is not so very anci∣ent as reported yet there is no Baskirian or Kirguese that remembers it's being erected Round about it is a circular ditch fathoms in circumference which on account of the sandy soil is not very deep With∣in this ditch is the place where the Kirguese if in the neighbourhood bury their dead  The lower part of the building of which I have given a representation is square thirteen Russian ells in breadth and seventeen in length the front and en∣trance are towards the south and raised above the lower part by a wall of two ells and a half the three other sides are ornamented with a cornice consisting of nine rows of outstanding bricks of which the three middle ones turn their angles outwards On the whole front runs a chamsret as an ornament and two others on both sides of the porch This porch is of Gothic con∣struction It is three ells and threequarters wide and rather more than seven ells high Within on both sides there are arched niches four ells high and two and a half broad and deep in each of which is a little square airhole through the wall The innerdoor is  also arched but the inside of the arch is filled up with a thin wall resting on a crossbeam of course the height of the gate from the sill to the crossbeam is but three ells and a half and the breadth sevenfourths As the bottom or floor of the building with∣in is somewhat raised there are a couple of bricksteps before it and on the upperstep lies a sill of fir∣wood not in the least decayed but worn in passing in and out The chapel within is just nine ells square and the walls are two ells thick the roof within is vaulted flat in the middle and built in a workmanlike manner and the centre of the roof is ornamented with a ball of argill and white earth the angles of the roof are rounded off and decorated with bricks placed in in the form of scales and supported by pilasters in the middle of each side within are niches and a circular place left in the centre of each niche half way through the wall To give light to this chapel there are in the westside some windowholes underneath the windows within all round the building is a hollow cornice where it is evident lights were burnt and wherein are three airholes in the southern wall and two in the sidewalls In the corner are some blind holes the use of which I could not conceive Near the floor is another hollow cornice all round which renders the walls thinner in these places and at the bottom seems as if it had been gnawn and some stones fallen out in sundry places Above this square build∣ing which is eight ells and a half high stands not di∣rectly  over the centre but streight over the arch a fun∣nel resembling a twelveangled cupola on a perpen∣dicular brickwork five ells and a half high with a plain cornice round it The cupola is eight ells high open above within which are many crossbeams so that a person may climb up to the top and that it may more easily be done there is a birchtrunk within with short cut branches serving as a ladder  The whole building consists of redbricks similar in shape and form to European ones The stones of the inside floor are square and of a cubic form and laid in mortar which seem quite fresh the roof only is thinly overgrown with moss  Within the porch are birchpoles leaned on both sides hung and covered with tufts of horses hair manes and tails and some rags of silkcotton The Kirguese be∣lieve it salutary to their horses if some of their tails and manes is left in such a sacred place and it is generally a Tartarian custom when passing before such holy places to leave something of what they have with them Within the porch also in part of the wall we found all sorts of little stones some lead balls an ar∣row gunpowder c Some of the Tartars of my escort having said their prayers made an addition to these things among which were a few small coppercoins Probably the blind angleholes within were designed for the deposit of such little offerings  Within the ditch was a variety of old and new graves close together The old ones on account of the sandy soil were almost fallen in and it was clear that they were cased to a considerable depth with birchpales and wood covered with little boards At every grave at the north or headend was stuck upright a birchpole seven feet high or one or two wooden lances with rib∣bands or rags tied on the top by way of flag and the latter is said to be peculiar to the graves of men On some the turf was beaten smooth and covered with mats of thin reedgrass sewed together About many were some old latticedwork of their felt tents which encompassed the grave like a hedge Upon some lay old saddles wooden bowls ladles c One was co∣vered with a frame on which they weave narrow pieces of camblets on many was a wooden spade with the handle stuck in the earth and about most were twis∣ted round the trellis or enclosures long girdles or ropes of horse or camels hair On one grave lay a kind of coffin in form of a little boat and turned on it's flat cover but it's size shews it would have held only a child On one was placed part of a cart of KaraKalpakskoi with it's two wheels seven feet high which perhaps was used in carrying the body This appear∣ed to be one of the handsomest graves or tombs Round the temple grew a great deal of kali and I re∣mark this because I saw it no where else afterwards either in these districts or those of the Samara or Ir∣tish  My drawing and description was not so soon finished as the prayer of the Baskirians who accompanied me I see out on my return at five o'clock encamped on the road and reached Troizkaja the next night without any disaster but that of our horses being almost knocked up  On the d of August I set out from Troizkaja to trace the river Ui up to the Uralian mountains and in my way towards night was obliged to sleep at a guardstation owing to a rising thunderstorm in view Scarce had I arrived but such a dreadful storm broke out as I had never seen in any country I had passed through It lasted three full hours and during all this time one could scarce count six seconds and generally but two or three without seeing the most fiery flashes of lightning and hearing the most tremendous roars of thunder The thundercloud had formed in the wes∣tern sky a broad dark girdle which stood immove∣able and underneath this cloud it flashed without inter∣ruption at last a violent shower followed and the next day was warm and serene again except a few wan∣dering thunderclouds  One of these forts was attacked this summer by Kirguisian robbers who had hidden themselves in the neighbouring pinewood and during a blind attack upon this small garrison carried off from the step all the horses belonging to the fort that were there feed∣ing  and the centinels with them who were placed to watch the horses some of whom were killed on the first onset and the garrison then deprived of horses was unable to pursue them  But this was a trifling disaster to the airplague which raged here in the neighbourhood at this time and might perhaps be owing to the situation of the place the morasses of a mountainous district exposed to the burning heat of the sun It was with difficulty my horses could gain admittance into the fort an edict having been issued by the commandingofficer that no strange cattle should be admitted into an infected place But my opinion was that it was proper to admit them and not suffer them to be exposed on the ground which was the source of the disorder I shall here dwell a lit∣tle on the nature of this distemper which makes a great ravage in this district in moist and hot summers where there are open steps or desarts with numberless fresh bitter and saltwater lakes and annually along the Siberian line by destroying a number of regimental horses there quartered  A description of this plague may be thought use∣less to an English reader but when it is considered that the same cause may operate in this and other countries a little enquiry into it may not be unac∣ceptable  Notwithstanding all the pains I took to be an eye∣witness of the effects of this plague I could not get an opportunity to open a fallen horse and examine into it as I could wish The plague had raged during the hot summermonths especially when the sultry southwinds blew but as soon as contrary winds succeeded the evil relaxed but if these contrary winds do not con∣tinue the disorder rages as before and will even attack those men who in these districts are more or less ex∣posed to it But this evil seldom shews itself in towns or forts either on men or cattle The former com∣monly feel it in the field or when they go into the country haymaking attending their herds c es∣pecially where the district is swampy It has been ob∣served by a detachment lately in the Kirguisian step and also upon many other occasions that there are cer∣tain low grounds in which this distemper is generally to be met with When this detachment had passed the night on such places it commonly happened that not only many horses fell the next day but that the in∣fection spread itself to men All these are very strong proofs of what I heard in other places during the win∣ter of a similar plague that used to shew itself in ma∣lignant tumours I even know that a gangrenous in∣flammation of the throat about the river Irtish has been considered as the same plague as that which raged here From the above circumstances and other symp∣toms of the disorder it seems plain that it's principal cause is certain insects hovering in the air and almost  invisible to the eye Add to this that it seizes men horses and cows whose skin is not much sheltered from their attacks whereas sheep whose bodies are defended by their wool never suffer in this calamity let it rage ever so violently and also that cooler spots are quite free from this evil at a time when it is prevalent in others About the Irtish there seldom a year passes with∣out this plague but near the water Burla situated only seventyfive miles from the Irtish where the air is al∣ways cool this scourge to men and beasts is unknown Here the inhabitants drive all the cattle they can spare from the forts and stations to feed during the unwhole∣some season  I will now describe the symptoms of this disorder in men The first is that the soundest and most healthy persons of any age or sex are suddenly troubled with an itching followed by a hard tumour in some particu∣lar part which seems to arise from the sting of a fly or horsestinger This swelling breaks out in the co∣vered or uncovered parts of the people but generally in the face and among horses in the groin and ab∣domen It rapidly increases in size and hardness and grows so insensible that one may prick the swoln part with a needle till we reach the sound flesh under it and the patient not feel it In the centre of this hard tu∣mour is commonly discovered in the external part a red or bluish point similar to the sting of an insect and if remedies are not applied the gangrenous putri∣dity  will extend itself farther During this first stage of the evil the patient feels no internal indisposition but with the increase of the boil he is afflicted with headachs anxiety and restlessness which are perhaps but the natural consequences of his fear of danger though the same anxiety even to sadness is visible in cattle but not till the distemper has reached it's high∣est degree and seems incurable Some peasants who accompanied me and had been afflicted with this dis∣ease told me that after the first symptoms had shewn themselves whenever they rode through a brook or within sight of water they felt themselves very faint feeble and ready to swoon  Cattle generally die of this distemper partly because the boil is discovered too late and partly because the common people do not like to meddle with the cows but men presently get free from it as soon as proper remedies are applied Dr  Gmelin  has in his Siberian travels described the method of curing it The com∣mon people after pricking the hard swelling in several places with a long needle rub into it a mixture of sal ammoniac and tobacco enjoining the patient not to drink any thing cold and to refrain from certain food About the Irtish they prick the tumour and bathe it with a strong lye of wormwoodashes and a decoction of tobacco and sal ammoniac or allum On the line of the river Ui infallible cures are said to be performed by a hot application of nightshade reduced to pow∣der  sal ammoniac levain and oatmeal Yet the ge∣nerality of the lowerclass of people prefer rather the old painful remedy and even surgeons have adopted it In some places they apply a living frog to the part but I cannot say with what success The remedies I have mentioned often successfully applied to horses are of such a nature that they will kill any species of insect and corroborates my opinion of their being some venemous insect which during the sultry sum∣mer days rises in the air of certain swampy spots and finds it's way into the skins of animals thus causing that dangerous gangrenous and deadly swelling Perhaps this is an insect similar to that observed by Swedish naturalists and which  Linnaeus  calls  furia infer∣nalis  or the hellish fury of which we have had but very few accounts but it is not probably of the same species it having been remarked in Sweden that this insect causes a much more rapid and most torturing death  Linnaeus Systema Naturae  Edit Vol II p  whilst this of Siberia operates slowly and almost without pain but the experiment may be tried which was successfully used in Sweden whether an ap∣plication of turned milk or fresh white cheese would not extract the insect from the infected part In such disorders it would be of great use to keep the cat∣tle all together in a particular pasture and make a  great smoke round them all the time the plague rages with every sort of roots dried turf and dung which would in all likelihood keep off the insects from troubling them  This country as far as Dr  Pallas  has hitherto travelled seems to be inhabited only by nomade na∣tions except at the sorts and manufactories The old boundary of the Russian empire before it's terri∣tory was extended as it is was fortified by a line of redoubts and properly garrisoned to keep the Tar∣tar nations from encroachments These garrisons are still kept up and he travelled from one to the other making excursions from each on both sides the line where he could hear of any thing worth his inspecti∣on It appears that the roads from place to place are beaten and in summertime tolerably passible near the forts and manufactories they are kept in some degree of repair and where there is no perma∣nent Tartarian village and the distance is too great between fort and fort posthouses for the accommo∣dation of travellers have been erected where horses are kept in readiness for their use  From the th of August to the middle of Decem∣ber he was detained by an inflammation of his eyes and swelling of the eyelids occasioned by the burning heat of the sun and the salt dust during his journey through the step or desart of Troizkaja  but having some young gentlemen with him who studied under him he sent one to explore the country in the neighbourhood and another to take an account of the fisheries in the Caspian sea The one was em∣ployed in searching the depth of caverns which are not of sufficient magnitude to claim the attention of an English reader but the Caspian fisheries we shall give an account of as Dr  Pallas  has related them from the last gentleman's account  September  The weather was so favourable in the beginning of September that I wished to have been able to have profited by it but the least air made my eyes exceedingly painful I was able however to take notice of the wandering birds and it was delightful to see them crowd here from the northern districts where according to accounts received by travellers the month of September had begun with snow and frost These took up their abode in the numberless lakes of this step which afford them plenty of food Every spot was full of wildgeese ducks and all sorts of waterfowl which are never wanting in autumn in the province of Iset∣skoi In spring these ultramarine birds direct their flight first to the warm southern steps which the snow soon forsakes and there stay till the northern rivers are free from ice They then draw northwards com∣monly with the end of April particularly the northgoose  Anser Erythropus  the iceduck  Anas hyemalis  the large varicoloured diver  Colymbus arcticus  the  white snowgoose and many others Great numbers of these remain and people the lakes namely the large wildgoose common ducks divers the several species of gulls the grey and white crane herons wood∣cocks c yet most of them fly also northward Several species however remain in these warmer dis∣tricts and never go farther north particularly the ber∣gander  Tadorna  and the red duck  Anas rutila  which arrives the soonest of all others having it's abode in the neighbouring southern districts and lakes of the Asiatic desart and returns again with the beginning of August as soon as it's young are fledged Those birds which build their nests northwards return to the south in autumn and feed in these watry districts till the general approach of winter drives them more to the south or across the sea The first that return are the common wild geese and many species of ducks soon after these the north geese and cranes and last of all the iceduck especially on the saltlakes  On the arrival of the geese preparation is made by the Cossacks and peasants to catch them a diversion they are fond of when harvest is over The manner of catching is worthy description as they are taken flying in nets of the following form  They fix on a lake pretty well encompassed with birchwood such a lake this bird prefers as sheltered from the wind and affording a more peaceful retreat  and greater plenty of food Every morning at sun∣rise the geese leave these lakes to feed in the open desart or step and return at night On that side of the lake or in the place through which the geese are accustomed to return they hew down the birches so as to leave a straight passage or alley about sixty feet broad through which the geese will afterwards take their flight which is not very high when so near home When there are more lakes than one near each other they open such a passage from one lake to the other and as the ducks will cruise through this pas∣sage often in the course of the night they are caught also At twentyfive or thirty fathoms from the lake they leave standing two very high birchpoles whose distance is so studied as to fit the net which is spread across the avenue from side to side These nets are made of strong hempen cord from thirtysix to sixty feet long and from fourteen to twenty feet broad The upperpart and short sides are bound with a rope and at both the uppercorners they fasten a small cord On the top of the two tall trees converted into poles by cutting off the branches they fasten a stake perpen∣dicularly with a fork at the end and climbing up the trees carry the cords fastened to the corners of the net up and fix them over these forks This enables them to draw up the net to the top of the poles and expand it so that the upperpart shall be twentyfour or twen∣tyeight feet high and the lowerpart within six or eight feet of the ground The net is then strained  tight and kept so by strings fastened by pegs to the ground The end of the ropes that draw up the net are fastened also in the ground at some distance behind and the fowlers lie down on the grass near them one on each side waiting till the morning for their game The geese generally rise from the lake an hour before the sun and of course do not see the nets in the dawn and as they fly with their necks right forward their heads are soon through the meshes The fowlers who have the ends of the ropes in their hands in readi∣ness no sooner find the geese touch the net but they immediately let go the rope the net falls by the weight of the geese and they are entangled and caught Sometimes they will catch ten sometimes twenty at a time but they always catch some Besides the large common goose and northgoose which is the most de∣licate bird roasted to be met with they take in the same manner different sorts of ducks and divers When the net is removed in the morning they leave the drawropes over the forks on the top of the trees to prevent climbing a second time and never remove them wholly till the season of catching is over  At the latter end of this month arrived here Capt  R De Rytschkof  the son of the learned counsellor of state and author of the same name I left him in the spring at Ufa with directions to travel over the nor∣thern districts of Casan and as he employed himself chiefly in the topography and history of the people  which will be printed distinct from this tour of mine it is unnecessary to say any thing about it here  For the information of our readers we will endea∣vour to supply this deficiency from that author The government or regency of Casan now compre∣hends Permia and the provinces along the Viaitka neither of which made any part of the antient king∣dom of Casan till it was subdued by the Russians The greatest number of the Tartars dispersed by the war have since collected and are settled in the envi∣rons of that city They are estimated at above males and occupy two considerable slabodes or suburbs of the city of Casan one of which is em∣bellished with two stonebuilt mosques and several misgirs or very high round towers the remains of the old city The other slabode contains two medscheds or houses of worship built of wood All the other Tartars of this regency dwell in separate villages at small distances from each other and bounded by those of the Russians  In the little town of Kargala thirteen miles from Orenburg is a colony of Casanian Tartars settled in who in paid the tax for males The place is rich having four medscheds or places of worship and what is very uncommon in this part of the country a number of pretty large stonebuilt houses  The mien c of the Tartars of Casan may serve as the characteristic marks of all the mahome∣dan Tartars in their neighbourhood they are in general short lean have a small face a fresh com∣plexion little nose small mouth and small black eyes a sharp look and deep chesnutcoloured hair which is lank and turns grey long before they are old They are in general wellmade and their sprightly manner straight shape and modest or ti∣mid mien give them a very agreeable air  Their capacity is but moderate but they are haughty and jealous of their honour negligent but not lazy clever at all sorts of handicraftwork neat sober frugal and humane These virtues they acquire by education and the precepts of their religi∣on to which they are zealously devoted They take a very particular care to educate their children well teach them to read and write the Arabic language and bring them up very religiously so that each school has a chapel and a priest It is not uncommon to find collections in manuscript of historical anec∣dotes in the huts of the peasants and their mer∣chants are extensively acquainted not only with their own history but that of adjoining states and with the antiquities of each  The Tartarian women are rather of a wholesome complexion than handsome of a good constitution  TARTARS of CASAN  and from their infancy are accustomed to labour retirement modesty and submission They habituate their youth to labour to sobriety and a strict obser∣vance of the other manners of their ancestors  The men shave their heads leaving only whiskers and a little beard upon the chin They wear linenshirts wide trowsers and buskins of skins but the poor wear shoes made of bark Their other cloath is a loose and light gown a long and wide uppercoat made after the eastern mode with long sleeves ending in a point generally open within the elbow to pass the arm through and on the outside of all they wear a belt to which hangs a sabre a knife and a tobaccopipe They wear on their head a lea∣ther cap over which they have another sort of cap flatter and turned up all round with a padded stuff The undergarments of the poor are made either of linen or nankeen whilst those of the rich are com∣posed of silk gold and silverstuffs The outer ones are of fine or coarse cloth according to the wealth of the wearer sometimes faced and sometimes not some wear lace on them and those who can afford it face their caps with gold embroidery and mount their sabres with silver  The dress of the married women in all the nations where they purchase their wives is more costly than that of the girls because the ornaments of the wife  do credit to the husband whereas those of girls would be a needless expence The women dress like the men as to shirts trowsers stockings buskins slippers upper and undergarments only that the halfboots of the women are pointed at the toes and the cut of their cloaths are somewhat different In summertime their cloaths are like those of the Tscheremisses Instead of stockings they wrap their legs in linen rags tied on with packthread wound several times round the calf Their shoes are made of the bark of trees cut into shapes and matted In summer they wear nothing over their shift which is not tucked into their trowsers but hangs over them all round Their shift is close at the neck and wrists cut into shape and reaches to the knees T  e neck wristbands and seams are covered with a whimsical embroidery of different coloured worsted a large buckle keeps it together at the bosom and a girdle round the waist When they would be more dressed than ordinary they put over this shift a habit like a morninggown made of varicoloured cloths tole∣rably fine and edge it with beaverfur Their caps are very high and in the shape of a cone made of birchbark covered with skin or linen ornamented with glassbeads little white shells and silvercoins From this cap a ribbon three inches broad orna∣mented in the same manner falls down on the back Some wear a broad ribbon on the forehead covered with pieces of money and glassbeads instead of the  conical cap They wear also a number of rings thimbles and all sorts of clattering pendants at their girdles which ornaments reach down to the joint of the knee behind and in walking they gingle as they go  In their food they differ a little from their ances∣tors Gruel and various messes of flour have been introduced and vegetables of the garden They eat unleavened bread baked on the hearth rice∣porridge and the  Kourmatsch  or parched corn of anti∣quity spoken of in Scripture  Ruth  iii This is either wheat rye barley or Turkish corn  Zea mays Linnaei  parched at the fire and then bruised in a mortar and either eaten in that state or boiled or in porridge with milk and water This Kour∣matsch kneaded with butter and fried or baked in an oven is called  Tolkan  and is a delicacy with the Tartars  Of meat they are at liberty by the alcoran to eat camels horses horned cattle all sorts of great game fallowdeer sheep and goats mountainrats birds poultry and fish but they must eat nothing that dies of sickness or is strangled on which ac∣count they cut the throats of the animals they catch and cover the blood they shed with earth But of all flesh they prefer the colt and among all the dishes made of meat they are fondest of the  bisbar∣mak  or the fivefinged dish so called because they eat with the fingers without fork or spoon it is a hash made of fat meat chopped and stewed They use no seasoning but when they would make a mess uncommonly nice they add to it grease or butter They drink milk alone or mixed with flour or oat∣meal and make butter or cheese On a journey they have bags into which they put sour milk in order that the whey may run off and enable them to turn the curd to various uses  Water is the common drink of the Tartars of Ca∣san though the rich drink sometimes milk tea and broths They cannot dispense with tea but prepare it different from ours They boil it in open pots with milk and water and having seasoned it with butter and salt drink it hot out of china or wooden cups The alcoran prohibits the use of wine spirits or beer but all without exception drink mead thus madeThe common sort is made of oatmeal flour and honey fermented together and put into a solution of honey and seven times the quantity of hot water filling up the cask with the so∣lution as they draw it for use so that a cask will last a long timethis they call  Asebab  Another kind of mead made of honey whey and wild cher∣ries beaten together they call  Eiran  Only a small number even of the rich sleep on featherbeds the usual manner is to put a piece of felt or carpeting on the bench which goes round the room and to lie down upon it Very few have pillows and they never take off their cloaths at night  The koran enjoins a cleanliness which they carry to excess They wash themselves all over several times every day and least they should contract any impurity from the natural excretion of urine they make water sitting on their heels  They commonly eat four times a day The bench on which they sleep serves them for table and chairs each sitting on his legs after the eastern manner They wash and pray before and after each meal  In wealthy families the women lodge and eat a∣part and are veiled when they go abroad and even at home they are never seen but when the husband wishes to shew particular respect to his guests The lower class of women and servants are less retired and walk abroad publickly  Old men of good character are held in great ve∣neration and as the beard turns grey very early in life with them  Akschakal  or greybeard is an ho∣nourable title which they confer on such men as are  wise and prudent These are always consulted in matters of importance supply the place of priests have always precedence and are arbitrators in all dis∣putes  The alcoran admitting of polygamy every man is allowed four wives but the greatest part have but one the rich often take two some will go so far as three but very few venture upon four These wives all enjoy the same right each having a claim to the caresses of her husband in her turn The purchase and maintenance of wives being expensive and more than one creating disturbance in a family they con∣sult their interest rather more than their pleasure and do not run to the end of the line allotted them The custom is to marry a second wife when the first ceases to be young and loses the power of pleasing yet this first is the principal wife though the new one is in possession of her husband's affections Mer∣chants who travel have a wife at every place where they have a house Should a merchant's wife in∣trigue he gives her up to her gallant and takes an∣other A Ghivinsian at Orenburg who had thus disposed of his eighth wife was already promised to a ninth Parents urge their sons to marry whilst boys but do not so with their daughters In the regency of Casan and Orenburgh the kalym or price of a wife is from twenty rubles to but the bride  generally brings a fortune with her equal to a fourthpart and sometimes to the half of what she costs  The evening before marriage the part over the  os pubis  is shorn by women and the espousals consist in a public declaration of the agreement be∣tween the parties contracting a priest then re∣peats a prayer pronounces them to be man and wife and the festival is closed with music and dancing They have an instrument peculiar to them called  Koba  a kind of violin open at top in shape some∣thing like a gondola having two hairstrings and played on with a fiddlestick the notes stopped by the fingers of the lefthand like a violin The songs of the Tartars are commonly in blankverse but very poetical and full of expression Lovers com∣pare each other to the sweet crane and tender turtledove and present them with their eyes their eye∣brows c Their music is martial the dancing of the men brisk and lively but that of the women slow and trailing with the hands always held before the face  Barrenness in a wife is a great disgrace especially if a man has but one wife and the barren women is always despised by those that have children A wo∣man after childbirth is held impure till the cus∣tomary signs of health return at which times she pu∣rifies herself by prayer and bathing The child is  carried to the priest within seven days of it's birth who whispers a prayer into it's ear gives it a name and then prays aloud The name given is generally that of the month in which it is born so that the whole nation would have but thirteen names if the father did not give the child the additional one of some relation which is always done at the festivaldinner given on this occasion Among the Nogay∣an Tartars settled about Astrachan they endeavour to facilitate the delivery of women by fixing a belt under their arms hoisting them up by this and letting them fall successively Boys are circumcised between the age of six and fifteen by a man who makes it his profession and as it is dishonourable not to have un∣dergone this ceremony before the age of fifteen the rich always pay for the poor  When persons are dangerously ill they are visited by the priest who prays with them When dead the corpse is washed wrapped in a linen or cotton windingsheet so as to have the face only uncovered and then sprinkled with camphire This done the priest fastens a label on the breast of the deceased with this sentence written on it in Arabic  There is but one God and Mahomet is his Prophet  The body is carried to the grave in a coffin but put into the earth without it The graves are five or six feet deep made northwest and southeast  with a space on one side within it large enough to hold the body Here it is placed so that when the earth is thrown on it does not touch the corpse for they conceive that after a short time two angels take it to the judgmentseat For the first three days it is not lawful to light a fire in the house of the de∣ceased and during the first month solemn prayers are said twice aday for the dead under an idea that his trial is going on in that time One passage in their ritual is  O God give him not over unto Hell but transplant him shortly into Paradise  The graves of the rich are distinguished by erect∣ing over them a little hut of balks or by placing stones round them for the splendid times are past in which the stately mausoleum was erected to the dead Others place only a post with a short inscrip∣tion on it whilst others have a headstone and an epi∣taph on it A specimen of these epitaphs we have given when speaking of Ufa  Not to enter into a detail of all the Mahomedan doctrines and opinions it will suffice to shew the ac∣customed ceremonies and general belief of the fol∣lowers of Mahomet in the Russian empire Moder∣tion in religious matters being held to be a mortal sin every village has it's medsched or chapel In cities mosques are spacious and neat but without ornament and within is an elevated place where  the koran is read and explained The floor is co∣vered with carpets and before the door is a small ves∣tibule where every person leaves his shoes on en∣tering the house of prayer So say the Scriptures  Take thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground  The medscheds of small vil∣lages are poor little huts badly constructed with a gallery instead of a steeple from whence the sexton calls the people to devotion The clergy are com∣posed of agouns or highpriests and moulas or priests One of their agouns has his seat at Casan another at Astrachan and a third at Tobolsk The clergy have no settled income but are often obliged to get a living by trade  According to their faith a mahomedan becomes impure by touching a dead body eating unclean food coition all the natural excretions and many other actions but bathing and prayer will purify the polluted body of course they are always at it for piety and good they say deserve heaven They have several ways of bathing but the most common is merely washing their hands their good works consist chiefly in fasting and alms days of the year they neither eat nor drink till after sunset  The Tartars are strong predestinarians They be∣lieve that the destiny of every man is fixed and that the angel of death calls him at his appointed hour  a belief that supports them in adversity and guards them from suicide Numbers indulge a piety bor∣dering on enthusiasm and imagine it is possible by religion to become a saint and that departed saints receive the prayers of the living Five times aday are they called to worship by the sexton who sings out their creed namely  There is but one God and Ma∣homet is his prophet  Nothing interrupts them in their devotion which they always perform with fervency turning their face towards Mecca or if at home towards the word  Alla  which is the name of God and written up in some part of every man's house  The prayers of the Tartars are written in Arabic Every one has a rosary by which he makes his peti∣tions The priest sits crosslegged facing the con∣gregation reading the prayers in a soft and pathetic tone of voice and the assembly repeats them or an∣swers  Amin  When the word  Alla  is pronounced every one heaves a profound sigh stops his ears and puts hands over his eyes and beard as if sensible of his unworthiness to hear the glorious name or lift up his eyes to Heaven During the prayers that are addressed to tutelary angels they cast their eyes about to the right and left At other parts of the service they sit down crosslegged rise often up bend the body profoundly forward remain so bent a a long time and frequently throw themselves pros∣trate Every one is without his shoes the rich in  prayertime put on a Turkish turban The agouns wear them always and the moulas keep on their common cap during the service of the mosque  They wash themselves prior to their taking an oath then striking the koran three times against their breast say  May thy curse smite me if I swear falsely  The other gentleman who had been at my desire continues our Author to inspect the fisheries in the Caspian sea and whose name is  Sokolof  had an oppor∣tunity in the course of six months and a favourable season of making many observations on animals birds insects and plants which I had not an opportuni∣ty of doing myself By his indefatigable zeal he sent me six species of mice hitherto unknown to naturalists and some of them remarkable These are the  mus ta∣mariscinus meridianus migralorius socialis lagurus  and  subtilis  I received also from the Caspian sea and southern step a variety of birds remarkable for their beauty and rarity being also new in natural history Among them was a very large species of black step∣lark  Alauda Tartarica  which remains in the de∣sarts during summer and comes southwards during win∣ter about the districts that are inhabited which other∣wise they would never approach also an unknown parrotgreen species of beeeater  Merops Persica  a very small species of searaven  Pelicanus pigmeus  the largest blackheaded seagull  Larus Icthyactus  a species of large seaduck with a red copped head  Anas rufina  a most superbly beautiful yellowcrowned heron with a long head and nape feathers  Ardea comata  and many other rare species of herons also two new species of serpents and a number of in∣sects and plants  In July Mr  Sokolof  stretched away westward from the Jaik into the Kalmuck step and saw there at a distance those little wild Kirguisian horses called  Kulan  but could not get near them as they took slight at the approach of the hunters He travelled near fifty miles over this saltstep without being able to find a drop of freshwater at last he reached a low plain overspread with saltlakes abounding with glau∣bersalts which form beautiful chrystals in the water and leave at the bottom a sediment of the same mix∣ed with common salt Some have the wonderful pro∣perty of deposing a salt quite red and smelling like violets consisting chiefly of glaubersalts with a very small mixture of kitchensalt the chief reason of this seems to be the soil which consists of a great quantity of seamuscles converted into chalk  After traversing near forty miles over this plain and a distance of thirty more over a sandy desart without a tree and scarce a plant he reached the Caspian shore In this sandy desart he met with a plant and  a bush peculiar to these sands the plant is a fennel  Ferula  described at the end of this volume the bush grows six feet high in a dry quicksand and never has been known to botanists as such it deserves par∣ticular notice I have given a drawing of it see page and also at the end of this volume a de∣scription and as this plant is by it's whole structure visibly different from every known genus I think I am at liberty to give it a generical name and have called it  Pterococcus Aphyllus  See the plate The Kalmucks and Bucharians call this bush  Torlok  and say it is to be met with in the sandy desarts of the Kirguese and that they use it's knotty stem which near the root is about one inch and a half diameter to make tobaccopipes of which it is very fit for on account of the hardness of it's wood The fresh roots of the bush if split through yield a great deal of clear gum which in quality is almost similar to the traganth swells very much in water and yields a brownyellow and sweetish jelly and if it stands warm will in a few days take on a vinous fermentation After this bush has dropped it's octagonal seeds or nuts it remains till autumn bare and leafless like rushes which shoot up longer and longer till they divide into new branches These fall towards winter leaving nothing but the wooden branches which produce again young twigs and blos∣som in spring This plant I shall speak of further hereafter  Mr  Sokolof's  description of the Caspian fisheries is of great importance not only to the Russian empire but to other European powers and as such I have given it to my readers in his own words  The fishery along the northern coast of the Caspian sea is held on lease by the merchants of Astrachan in which their chief wealth consists The nearest place from the mouth of the Jaik where this fishery is car∣ried on is a bay about fifty miles distant formerly called  Bogatoi Kultuk  the rich bay on account of the multitude of fish there caught At the end of March the Caspian sea is clear from ice The fishery begins in April and Mr  Sokolof  set out on the th of that month to take a view of it He went in a boat to the said bay as the way was impassable by land Near the bay are five fishing towns and magazines The bay is so full of fish that they fish it with success at five different times in the year For miles to the west of this bay there is no fishing carried on except in the middle of summer and the shad and barbelfish∣ing with nets in spring and autumn there being no other fish on account of the different species of stur∣geon with which the bay and shallows of the coast a∣bound owing to the water being freshened by the flowing of some rivers into it In these places they de∣pose their spawn or go up the river to pass the winter besides the quantity of seaweeds here harbours shoals  of little fish which serve as food to fishes of a larger species  On the coast as far as the fishery extends there are watagas or magazines erected where are salted only large fish such as the different species of sturgeon sewrjugs salmon and barbel Each wataga has boats of different sizes and structure fit to go out to sea with a few men The largest are manned with five men the smallest with two and are equipped with sails Near each wataga is a large vessel with provisions instruments and salt for salting the fish which is brought from the Imperial magazine at Astrachan These vessels sail to and fro from Astrachan to the fisheries bring salt and other materials and return loaded with fish which is landed on wharfs near the watagas The fish is cut open cleaned washed c on floats which are sometimes covered and the ves∣sels from these floats are laden and unladen The workmen are all hired from the interior parts of Russia and the towns situated along the Wolga they are sometimes engaged for the whole year sometimes only for a spring autumn or winterfishery Some of them are Kalmucks of the uluss of Bambar who had taken up their winterquarters about the Caspian sea before the greatest part of the Kalmuck hordes had left this district Each wataga employs from fifty to men as the tenant can afford Some are engaged as steers∣men some as rowers some to salt the fish some to  dress the roe and others to prepare the fishglue c all according to the different branches they have ser∣ved an apprenticeship to for which they have a salary never exceeding forty or fifty rubles for each fishingseason but the general pay is twenty rubles Old steersmen who have acquired more skill in the fishery by long practice and experience are appointed as di∣rectors and these have better pay  Besides these men there are many merchants and citizens from Astrachan that reside here during the fishery These people agree with the proprietor or tenant and fish for him at a certain price for all the fish they catch using their own boats and implements The price paid for each sewrjug is from four to six copecs each copec one halfpenny English and each bjeluga from eight to twelve copecs but fishes of extra size are counted as two or more  Besides the houses of the fishermen near every wa∣taga are many sheds and covered places where the roe is prepared the fishglue and backsinews dried and all the materials kept for fishing For the salted fish they have caves and subterraneous icecellars of different sizes These contain a wooden floor and large wooden troughs in which the saltpickle is prepared On each side of the picklingtroughs are divisions where the fish is laid after it has been taken from the salt and is again strewed over with fresh salt and be∣hind  these divisions the space is filled with ice in order to keep the fish fresh  The watagas are situated in places where the sea is deep enough to carry vessels and where the shore by it's elevation is sheltered against the southwind which swells the waves and makes them lash the shore These spots then are commonly high capes where the sea forms deep bays and from which the step is sepa∣rated by rushy seamarshes passable only in boats On these capes grows as much grass as is necessary to feed the horses kept for the winterfishery The duties which the watagas pay to the state are in proportion to the quantity of fishglue and roe they prepare Each pud of fishglue pays five rubles and each pud of roe two rubles eighty copecs  In spring the bay is crowded with beljugas sewr∣jugs and Wolga sturgeons at this time without roe coming here only to feed but sewrjugs depose their spawn at this season and do not return the whole year In winter and autumn they catch only beljugas which collect here to spawn and pass the winter  The springfishery begins as soon as the sea is free from ice which often happens in the middle of March Then large shoals of small fishes approach the coast of these one little fish  Cyprinus Griflagine  called in Russ  Obla  about an inch long is the most fa∣vourite  food of the beljugas who soon after follow them in great multitudes As soon as the obla appears they catch a great many of them in dragnets put them alive into reservoirs and preserve them as baits for the hooks as the beljuga bites at nothing so soon When the beljugas enter the bay in troops which is generally a fortnight after the appearance of the obla the fishery begins If this time is passed over the tenant loses his advantage Then the fishers are at work night and day and as soon as they have brought one boatload ashore they push off for another In brisk seagales there is the best fishing for it has been observed that such gales drive the fish upon the coast but if the wind blows from the land it always impove∣rishes the fishery In good seasons a boat will catch upwards of fifty large fishes in two hours  The beljuga is caught here with lines and hooks The tackling consists of seventeen ropes feet in length to which they tie cords each cord ten feet long with hooks fastened to it at the distance of eighteen inches from each other Thirty of such tack∣lings compose what they call a  Snast  which consists of some hundred fathoms of line Between every snast is tied a stone weighing many pounds and also a buoy of dried reedmace which floats on a rope fourteen feet long To all this tackling are fastened two anchors Such an anchor consists of two split pieces of a tree each of which has a strong branch at one end  that gives it the form of an anchor and this is loaded with bricks to give it weight Each anchor has a cable of about twentyfathoms long When the anchors are cast they tie an obla to each hook and the whole is thrown into water three or four fathoms deep so that the tackling lies at the bottom giving the baits a liberty of swimming and the beljugas greedily swallowing them are caught on the hooks and as the anchors keep the tackling in it's situation the largest fish cannot escape The whole is raised twice aday and drawn with the fish into the ship When taken off the hooks to prevent their fainting by lying together a rope is drawn through their gills and they are let down the ship's side into the water in order to be brought ashore alive When ashore they are drawn by hooks upon a scaffold and cut up one after another First they split the head with an ax then cut open the belly and take out the entrails roe gluebladder and last of all the dorsal sinews The lower part of the abdomen and the bowels are thrown away but the wide and fleshy snout is salted and sold at five or six copecs each A middling sized beljuga has a stomach that will contain two whole seacalves or seals besides a great number of small fishes In spring the beljuga has seldom any roe but most are milters After having taken the roe out they tear out the glue or airbladder which occupies the whole back put it into a pail and prepare to extract the isingglass they next cut open the cartilages of the back draw out the  backsinews wash them and hang them up over poles to dry  When all the bowels are taken out the fat which lies plentifully about the milt in milters is scraped off with knives collected in a pail and afterwards boiled and cleaned This fresh fat is goodtasted and may be used instead of butter or oil In Astrachan it is sold from forty to fifty copecs  per  pail  The fish thus cleaned is washed and carried into the abovementioned caves where it lies for twelve hours or more in a strong pickle or brine it is then put into boxes and covered with salt Beljugas are here caught of an enormous size In the winter one was taken seventeen feet in length and it weighed seventy puds that is upwards of lb from which they took twenty puds of roe or lb The largest sewrjug never exceeds nine feet in length from the point of the snout to the end of the tailfins Large beljugas will swallow young seals geese and wildducks whole  Soon after the beljuga fishery is over and often be∣fore that of the sewrjug begins This does not last above a fortnight and is but once a year as they come up into the fresher water to spawn This first is caught in nets and if a favourable gale blows they come in such quantities that the vessel will not contain the  draught but they must be brought to land by ropes Each wataga will catch in a short time sixty or seventy thousand but if contrary winds blow only half the quantity This fishery is important on ac∣count of the roe or cavear which is prepared two ways one is called granular the other bagcavear The granular is pressed through a coarse sieve to cleanse it from the skins and bloodvessels and then salted in troughs One pud of roe will take five pounds of salt It remains in these troughs about an hour is then spread over fine sieves that the superflu∣ous brine may drain away and after this it is bar∣relled  The bagcavear after being cleaned from the skins is put for half an hour into strong brine then taken out and drained by laying it on sieves after this it is put into pointed bags like those used in apotheca∣ries' shops each bag containing eighteen pounds In these bags it is squeezed till all the brine is out and then put into barrels and trod down by a man in lea∣ther stockings afterwards the casks are closed and well done over with tar to prevent any of the roe run∣ning out Bagcavear is

in the middle of December and after travelling about miles reached the town of Tjumen situated on the Tura on the th This town after being destroyed by fire is newbuilt in regular streets Here I had the pleasure of conversing with Dr  Lepechin  a mem∣ber of the Imperial academy of sciences for some hours He resolved to pass his winter here At night I continued my journey over the Tura near the burialplace of the famous  Steller  wellknown for his tour to Kamschatka In nineteen hours I reached Tobol∣skoi a distance of miles This road is very well regulated for at every twentyfour or thirtysix miles there are places erected for the accommodation of tra∣vellers and changing of horses The district between Tjumen and Tobolskoi which I travelled over is an open plain with here and there a small wood  I shall not take up any time in describing the city of Tobolskoi however important it is to the government of Siberia it having been fully done by  Gmelin  in his tour to Siberia The few observations I made relate to natural history and will be better spoken of in an∣other place I met here with Captain  Islenief  who afterhaving made his observations on the transit of Ve∣nus over the sun at Jakuzkoi and other geographical business in Siberia proposed passing the winter here His Excellency Chevalier  De Tscbitscherin  governor of this place shewed me every civility in his power and provided me with every thing necessary for the pro∣secution of my journey  Tobolskoi is the capital of Siberia has an arch∣bishop and was built in by the government of Russia just at the confluence of the Tobol with the Irtish in the room of the ancient city Sibir that was burnt down and stood twelve miles lower down the river on the righthand shore of the Irtish Sibir by it's ruins seems to have had the form of a fortified camp and to have been built with unburned bricks like the Bulgarian cities This part of the country was the principal seat of the Tartars before the Rus∣sians added that vast territory to their dominions When  Yermak  had penetrated as far as the Irtish in and driven from thence the Khan of Siberia Sibir was demolished and the Tartars of those parts were in general dispersed This  Yermak  was a rob∣ber  who at the head of some thousands of Cossacks pillaged the cities on the borders of the Wolga and the Caspian sea and took possession of them but finding himself not able to keep them made an offer of his conquests to the Czar  Ivan Vassilievitsch  and desired his assistance  Yermak  obtained it and also a pardon for himself and his people and since this time the Russians have had possession of Siberia  The present Tartars of Tobolskoi are descended from the ancient Tartars of Siberia who kept their ground They take their name from the Tobol both sides of which they occupy from the Kirguese frontiers to the mouth of that river Their villages contain from ten to fifty farms and they are in num∣ber about males They are Mahomedans and resemble altogether in their manners and customs the poorer sort of the Tartar villagers of Casan Their poverty keeps them from luxury and de∣bauchery and few have but one wife as a marriage∣ble girl fetches from twenty to fifty rubles  I remained in Tobolskoi from the th to the th of December when I proceeded on my return which was rendered very disagreeable by a violent hurricane and snow I sat out with Dr  Lepechin  for Catherine∣burgh at the distance of miles we arrived there in nine stages on the st of January early in the morn∣ing and I continued my journey alone the same night  sixty miles further and took up my winterquarters at Tscheljabynskaja which I reached in the night of Jan d  Hitherto the district of the regency of Orenburg and the adjacent provinces had been the object of my en∣quiries but they having all been visited and examined either by me Dr  Lepechin  or Professor  Falk  the chief end of the Imperial academy of sciences was at∣tained and the few remaining objects worth notice would be inspected on our return or by the mission of some of our learned assistants Much more however being to be done in the natural history of these domini∣ons and the extensive kingdom of Siberia and the northern districts of the empire promising many disco∣veries having not yet been thoroughly explored and many accounts of  Gmelin's  and  Steller's  tours through Siberia having been lost the Imperial academy agreed to a plan sormed by me and Dr  Lepechin  which was that he should travel on his return to the northermost districts of the regency of Casan the whole of Archangel and the coasts of the White Sea and that I should extend my journey even beyond the districts of the sea Baikal to view and describe such places which had been slightly passed over by the late Mr  Gmelin  or had undergone an alteration since he was there especially the distant Siberian mines and manu∣factories and the inhabited southern frontiers to collect carefully every remarkable plant and do the same in  Zoology thus fulfilling perfectly what preceding tra∣vellers had accidentally only taken up in their way and whose labours were devoted to botanical views and of course but little had been transmitted to the scien∣tific world To accomplish this plan it was necessary not to lose time but to dispatch the most learned of my assistants to different districts On the th then of February I sent Mr  Basil Surjef  through Tobolskoi to the northern town Beresowa situated on the Ob or Oby from whence he was to proceed in the begin∣ning of summer as far as Obdorskoi Ostrog down the Ob and if passable as far as the Icy Sea  In the middle of march Professor  Falk  arrived here from Orenburg with the last sledge having fixed up∣on a Siberian tour and wishing to consult me on the subject He had made along the line a very pleasant journey but a very dangerous one and came here a fortnight later than his assistant Mr  Georgi  celebrated by his translations and other works of merit and who came the straight road over the Ural The arrival of these gentlemen made my residence in Tscheljabyn∣skaja more agreeable than it had hitherto been and I had only to lament that the sudden arrival of spring obliged us to part company  Capt  Ritschkof  who had been with me most part of the winter seemed disinclined on account of his deli∣cate constitution to travel with me into Siberia and  requested me to procure leave from the academy at Petersburg to return home taking some districts of the Ural in his way that had not been visited This leave was obtained but it being just determined to dispatch a body of lighthorse from the fort Orskaja under the command of Colonel  Traubenberg  into the Kirguisian step in order to pursue the removed Kal∣muck hordes this excellent opportunity thus offering itself Captain  Ritschkof  could not withstand and as he wished to accompany them I consented to his going He went and the success of his difficult journey with his observations may be read in his own journal  I prepared for my own journey but before my set∣ting out thought proper to pen down some general ac∣count of the province of Isetskoi where I wintered Of all the ports that belong to the regency of Oren∣burg this is incontestably the happiest for fertility and tillage and tolerably well peopled yet not so much as it deserves for the richness of it's soil They reckon here male inhabitants among which are that trade and pay no headtax The different Baski∣rian ulusses settled eastward from the Ural consisting of habitations belong to this province besides habitations of Medscheraks and Tartars If this population is compared with the extent of the province which is near miles long and broad it will natural∣ly occur that even this great number of people is not sufficient to cultivate the country At present they  sow annually near dessatins of land each dessatin one hundred square fathoms and they com∣monly reap tensold of what they sow Rye and wheat are the chief grain here but they sow occasionally barley and oats not only supplying a great part of the line of Orenburg but all the manufactories situated on the Ural and part of those of Catherineburg In the general failure of the crops in when even in many places of this province they scarce reaped as much as they sowed on account of the long dry weather yet the crops here were so great as not only to supply the abovementioned places but also the ad∣jacent provinces of the whole regency or government of Orenburg and absolutely saved them from famine  Besides the great growth of corn in this province the soil which is black and rich throughout even to the depth of two feet in some places yields not only the finest grass but is fit for gardens All common vege∣tables prosper here exceedingly especially turneps which grow to an enormous size Yet through the negligence of the inhabitants here are only sown coleworts turneps and parsneps They cultivate a few hops but these growing so plentifully wild every where in the Uralian mountains raising them is un∣necessary Flax and hemp is also sown here but not being a saleable article the farmer never sows more than is necessary for his own use In a garden in the midst of a desert which has been many years aban∣doned  I saw with astonishment spontaneously grow∣ing the mallowflower the turnsol the French mari∣gold  Tagetes  and the holy thistle Garden straw∣berries and the dwarfcherry  Cerasus pumila  grows wild every where and shews that the soil is fit for any production that can be expected from a temperate clime  There are no other manufactories in this province than a bad hat and a glass manufactory some few tanneries two brandydistilleries belonging to the crown and the ironmanufactories that have been mentioned  The game here is not of any great moment two sorts of martens are caught and some bad wolves and foxes When the Kirguese are peaceable sportsmen go with the leave of the commanding officers of their step and return loaded with the skins of groundfoxes wolves beavers and otters In the step of Isetskoi they catch plenty of ermines of a fine size and during my slay here the Tartars caught a sable not far from Tscheljabynskaja which they looked upon as a great rarity  In summer there is plenty of watergame and in winter a great abundance of woodcocks and wildgeese The mountains produce noble birds of prey a fine species of falcons and sparrowhawks In the  woods about the Iset we meet sometimes a species of sparrowhawk  Falco palumbarius  which grows quite white when old and is much prettier and larger than the common ones  On account of the numberless lakes here are vast quantities of fish the common sort are sold from twentyfive to thirtyfive copecs  per  pud If the bot∣toms of the lakes are sandy the place is crowded with the  Cypr Idbarus  which are cheaper still They catch now and then a kind of Siberian trout but they have neither bream nor crabs though they are found in great plenty in the Jaik almost up to it's source  I must not omit speaking of the air which about the mountains is wonderfully healthy and it's inhabitants live to a great age Many countrymen are here met with years old and I saw a soldier at Troizkoi who was but the low part of the province among the salt morasses and foul lakes is subject to fevers and scorbutic disorders not so much however as to shorten the life of the inhabitants The bitter saltdust dispersed by the wind causes great inflammations of the eyes and boils upon the eyelids and in this dis∣trict the airplague rages very much among horses and destroys many but does not insect the people  During the first week of March we had a continual thaw and the air was so mild that on the th Holy  Thursday many of the common people bathed them∣selves according to an old custom derived from slavish heathenism in the river though covered still with ice They say that in former times this was the feast of  Kupal  the god of waters So on the Thursday before Whitsunday the country lasses ho∣nour even now with poetical songs and garlands  Lada  the ancient goddess of love and her son  Dida  their feast having been celebrated on that day in the times of heathenism From the th to the th fell a great deal of snow but directly after the weather became so warm that the Mjass was freed from the ice by the end of the month and overflowed it's banks On the th of April the waters sunk and I thought proper to proceed on my journey before the snow from the mountains swelled the rivers again Several wan∣dering birds appeared on the th of March such as jackdaws and cranes and soon after to the th swans and all sorts of ducks and these after the last snow on the th of March were followed by geese starlings larks and many wood and waterfowl On the th of April came the cuckow also a species of buntling and a bird called  Fringilla calcarata  which runs about the fields in numbers and is no where seen but in Siberia On the th of April appeared the first insects  On the th I left Tscheljabynskaja which is a fort that was erected against the troubles among the Baski∣rians  and Kirguese The place is fortified in the usual mode with timberworks and it's streets are regular it is situated on the sleep and rocky bank of the river Mjass has a stonebuilt and a wooden church and many good public and private buildings Most of the dwelling houses are built in the country stile and the occupation of most of the inhabitants is husbandry  The night before our departure on the north side of the river I saw the whole horizon in fire owing to the st  p which had been burning three days and had not a heavy rain quenched the flames the town would have been in danger as the wind blew right towards the suburbs Such stepfires are very often seen in these districts the whole latter half of April  The first night we lay out on the field but at the next port we reached we heard they had lost several horses and examining them the people told me they discovered a deepseated boil on their buttocks hidden under the skin in which there was a short worm as thick as one's finger They described this worm as too large for one to suppose it to be the Swedish  Curculio par  plecticus  yet the circumstances that caused the boil were here the very same  As soon as we crossed the river Mjass with our horses I continued my journey along it where are a number of villages but the road struck off through a hilly  district Our eyes were charmed the whole day with the Siberian windflower  Anemone patens  that grew every where where the lands were not very salt It is here and throughout Siberia called  Wetriniza  windflower and is well known by the countryman as the young peasants often raise false boils on several parts of their bodies with the bruised herb of this flower in order to be declared incapable of military service when there is any press or levying of soldiers In want of this herb they make use of a kind of sharp garlick which will raise boils but which are readily cured again by covering them with wax The peasants also use a decoction of the windflower against all convul∣sive complaints of their children The fields were also embellished with the pheasantseye  Adonis Apennina  and the  Adonis verna  which blooms sooner Both spe∣cies here go by the same name They preserve the roots as the most important of all domestic remedies and petulant girls use it occasionally by way of revenge to bring on miscarriage  In my way on I crossed on the st of April the river Kurtamysch on the banks of which stands the markettown Kurtamysch  fkaja on an open sandy hill round which the river makes an extensive bend This town was erected twenty years ago with all the villages that belong to it It has a commissioner and a townhouse subordinate to the regency of Isetskoi and to it's jurisdiction belong twentyfour villages  situated on this river and on some little lakes consist∣ing of men the markettown Talofskaja with it's dependency men and Kaminskaja men the last two add noble families so that the male inhabitants of this whole district amount to This place besides the townhouse and a wooden church has only sixtyeight dwellinghouses Before the line of Ui was erected this was a fort and it is still sur∣rounded with the old works The district is not very good for husbandry on account of the saltness of the soil the best soil growing barren every three or four years and wheat never thriving here at all Former∣ly here were a great many elks in the hilly woods but they have deserted the place since it has been inhabited They catch however a great many ermine foxes c sometime the racehare  jaculus  and sometimes stags that wander here from the Kirguisian step  The lowlands are abundantly covered with a ni∣trous salt which lies over the moist ground puffed up like foam It contains a mixture of glaubersalt and so much alkali that it effervesces with acids In general all the salttracts here are so impregnated with a bitter and common salt proportionably nitrous that it may be squeezed from the ground in spring in form of a spungy very moist white paper foam which in long dry weather breaks down into a snowwhite flour The cattle gather round this salt in great quan∣tities yet will eat but little of it it having a urinous taste  Having sent on my waggons to Kaminskaja when I had examined this salty district sufficiently I followed them and was there on the d of April This place consists of houses of substantial families and lies on an arm of the Tobol which abounds with all sorts of fish particularly barbel and roach which are often near inches long In winter this place is very watry and abounds with waterfowl particularly large white cranes of which further mention shall be made With all other sorts of game the country abounds and is rich even in elks and wild boars Ducks are here taken flying in such nets as I described were erected in other parts to catch geese and they also make snares of horsehair fastened in rows on a rope extended over the surface of the waters in which ducks and other waterfowl are abundantly caught The countryfolks here by a strange superstition incense these snares with the curled galls that form themselves on worm∣wood and southernwood idly conceiving that it will prevent evil eyes bewitching the snares  I sat out from this place in order to cross the Tobol at twentysix miles distance but found that a storm the day before I arrived had sunk the ferryboat and they had only a slight raft much too slight to carry my two heavy waggons besides I met with a party on my way of dragoons which were marching against the Kirguese who had lately committed several robberies and seized some travellers and as I could not  get a sufficient escort at this place to pass safely I re∣turned to this determining to proceed by another route But to add to my mortification one of the gentlemen with me Mr  Sokolof  was attacked with an ague my draftsman who had sunk into a lowness of spirits some months past was now worse and an atten∣dant who had been afflicted with the scurvy all the winter fell sick and another had been thrown from a wild Kirguisian horse and lay in a very shocking and shattered condition I could proceed only therefore in that slow way which the state of my patients would admit  On the th of April I proceeded down the Tobol and picked up in my way a species of a little grey dormouse with a black stripe on it's back and a very long tail  mus subtilis  very common in the birch∣woods near this place This little animal falls asleep in the least cold and creeps into small chinks of the earth or holes in the ground where it rolls itself up like a ball till enlivened again by the warmth  On the night of the th we had a sharp frost so as to freeze the water and yet the flowers and flower∣buds stood it well for the plants in this climate agree well with it's different changes of weather Down∣wards along the Tobol there are many villages and the district is as much inhabited as the most populous district in all Russia  About fifty miles below Kaminskaja on the river Tobol is situated the hill called LarewKurgan a hill of an enormous height raised by hand But no cer∣tain tradition has been left of it It appears doubtful whether it is not a monument of some extraordinary event or the tumulus of some person of distinction erected by the ancient inhabitants of this district The circumference of the hill is feet and is at sixteen feet distance encompassed with an overgrown circular bank ten feet and a half high and a ditch which in it's whole circuit measures feet The form of this hill was conical pointed at top and was higher than at present but a certain prince caused the top to be taken off and a deep pit to be dug into it in order to discover it's contents nothing however was found The whole hill is richly covered with grass and stands near a village where they are erecting a stone∣church but as they are obliged to fetch their mortar a great way it goes but slowly on The inhabitants have here begun to erect their ovens with brick instead of those which they used to build with clay and which so often fired their maltkilns The ovens they now build are well vaulted with ventholes on the sides just underneath the roof and a chimney closed at top having a smokehole on each side Through these smokeholes no spark can get so as to set fire to the straw spread about it and the whole kiln is thus pre∣served from taking fire owing to the chimney's being closed at top  On the first of May my patients being better I crossed the river Ik which is here feet over and deep  The villages are small but stand in this coun∣try very thick and a commissioner who resides in one of them has the command of twenty or more according to their situation They sow here a great deal of rye wheat oats and millet which is bought up by commissioners from the crown and carried a∣way in barges in summertime and on sledges in winter  On the night of the d we had a violent storm accompanied with a fall of snow which covered the ground a foot thick and interrupted my journey till the next day We had scarce travelled twentythree miles further but my attendant who was so ill with the scurvy grew worse The great frost had done him harm and this added to clandestine intem∣perance carried him off with a mortification in his bowels I gave him every assistance in my power but it was all in vain he expired on the d of May when he little expected it I left some of my people to bury him and continued my journey the same afternoon  Thirty miles lower down the Tobol is a consider∣able brandydistillery erected twenty years since by two merchants but belonging now to Count  Schuwalof  Above three hundred houses are here built along the Uk which empties itself into the Tobol and there is a fine wooden church and mansion for the direc∣tor with a garden 'comptinghouse and storehouses  Opposite to this are the distilleries one of which has ten tubs forty common coppers three alembics and several receivers another thirtyfive coppers and an∣other thirtyone with sixtythree tubs and each tub two receivers Each tub contains ten tschetwerts of malt mixed with a fifth or seventh part of oats or bar∣ley The common coppers contain fortytwo Russian gallons each and are all filled with the wash of one tub and these distillations come round in succession once in four days of course the business is carried on with∣out interruption  so that if thirty coppers of fortytwo gallons each are filled from one tub that holds ten tschetwerts we may easily know what a tschet∣wert is  Near each distillery is a large copper from which the hot water is led by pipes into the tubs and here are granaries and a large maltkiln They distill here from to tschetwerts of malt which is conveyed here in winter and from each tschet∣wert they draw three or four gallons of Russ brandy or spirits which always goes through a second distillation A great deal of corn is raised about this place and a number of people are constantly felling wood c They cut the wood here very imprudently for one may go through a tract of two or three miles long and not see the vestige of a tree left except the roots In the stillhouses there is such a thick vapour that a stranger cannot stay a quarter of an hour in them without be∣ing intoxicated and the vapour is so spirituous that it might be kindled with a light I endeavoured to per∣suade  the proprietors of the loss they sustained in pas∣sing their spirit through a second distillation in which it loses a third of it's strength but it was to no purpose they said it was strong enough and were unconcerned at the loss but it should be considered that the loss is not only to them but to the country at large as it wastes a considerable quantity of corn  The people whom I left to bury their fellowtravel∣ler joined me on the th of May and we sat off the following day together early in the morning and after travelling miles past many villages that contained nothing more remarkable than what I had seen before and many tumuli I found myself in a district of the Ischimian step full of uncommon large lakes and therefore abounding with waterfowl and particularly that large species of white cranes of which I was desi∣rous of knowing some particulars I resolved there∣fore to stay a couple of days in this place Krataja and to send out for some of these birds One of the lakes in this step is twentytwo miles long and seven miles broad All of them are very full of fish and feed great quantities of waterfowl which as the inhabi∣tants are thin build their nests here in tolerable safety About one of these lakes called  Mangut  which is almost inaccessible on account of it's swamps are many wild boars and about the lake Saltaim have been built within these ten years several villages colo∣nized  by persons who have been transported into Sibe∣ria for little misdemeanours  On the th the persons I sent to bring me some of those white cranes returned with several  Grus Leuco∣geranus  It was with difficulty they could get them to stand so as to have a shot at them for these birds are much more cautious than other cranes and if they once see a man even at the greatest distance soar up into the air with a music equal to that of the swan Their height standing upright is five feet and this enables them to see a great way and they are so timid as to suspect every the least motion of a reed It is therefore necessary that a gunner should approach them quite covered whilst they are feeding on small fishes on the banks of the lakes which is their custo∣mary food Timid as they are before men they are bold enough against dogs whom as soon as they see they will attack with great fury forgetting the lurking sportsman who is with them If any man approaches their nests they are equally bold will never fly but protect their abode to the last and on account of their large size and the sharpness of their bills are formidable enemies They build their nests in solitary rushy mo∣rasses and fens on hillocks of seaweed and twisted rushes The male and female guard the nest by turns They lay but two eggs which are as large as a gooseegg and spotted with yellow green and brown This was just the season of their breeding In one year's  time the young crane is almost as large as the old one and his body is covered with ochreyellow feathers whiter under the belly and about the head and his bill is blackish In the second year he becomes white and keeps only the outermost wingfeathers the head grows red above the eyes where there are no feathers but only small red hairs At this time the billskin and feet are red and the neck continues yellow but deeper and more firy which as the bird grows older becomes white as a swan This bird flies from over the Caspian sea in the spring of the year commonly single and very high in the air but is no where so fre∣quently to be met with as are the common cranes  The next thing I enquired for was the flying squir∣rel and sent some hunters abroad into the birchwoods in search of some This wonderful little animal  Sciurus volans  is common from the Uralian moun∣tains throughout all northern Asia or Siberia where there are any birchwoods with or without firs is al∣ways seen on high and builds it's nests in the trunks of trees from whence it does not go out but at twilight or night to feed upon the birches it's food being the fruit that grows upon the birch small and brown in winter blooming in spring and filled with seeds in sum∣mer thus serving as aliment to this animal through∣out the whole year Where there are fir trees it eats their buds and it's entrails have then a very resinous smell but otherwise they have a birchsmell It  seldom runs upon the ground and yet is in the habit of dropping it's dung at the bottom of those trees where it lives When it leaps from one tree to another it spreads out the solds of it's fur with all it's feet which from the forefeet to the ham may be extended on both sides by a bone like wings with which it will quiver in the air something like flying and can direct itself in it's flight by it's woolly and broad tail In this manner it will fly or leap to the distance of feet not horizontally but in an oblique direction downwards from the top of one tree to the middle or trunk of an∣other When it climbs the birchtree it is scarcely distinguishable by it's whitegrey colour from the bark of these trees thus has Nature wisely protected this animal from nocturnal birds of prey This is the season in which the flying squirrel drops it's young they commonly bring forth only two sometimes three and but rarely four they are first callow and blind I kept a nest that was brought me a long time The mother sat the whole day over her young ones and wrapped them up in her wingskin but at night as soon as the sun was set she covered them with moss and went to search her food The young ones grew very slowly and did not get their hair and foreteeth till after the space of six days They remained blind to the thirteenth day when I found them all dead and one almost devoured by the mother If these animals when brought to me were but two days old and by their size they appeared to be of that age they must  remain blind for a fortnight after their birth which is not the case with any quadruped we know as yet The mother died soon after notwithstanding all attempts were made to save the little creature's life I might have had better success in winter but then it is hard to catch them They often fall into those bruising traps set on trees to catch squirrels with  On the th of May the heat of the weather was equal to deg and a half of  De L'Isle's  thermome∣ter had encreased one deg and a half within the last three days and was attended with a violently hot southern storm that blew hard and carried with it a great deal of saltdust which hurt our eyes much Towards night we heard a great bustling and the noise of a vast quantity of waterfowl such as swans ducks herons divers c which continued till midnight This was the second prognostication we had by aquatic music of an approaching frost for after twelve o'clock at night the wind changed to the north and blew all the next day so cold that we were obliged to look for our furs yet we found in bloom the oalerian  Valeriana officinalis  the chichling vetch  Lathyrus pisisormis  the skyslower  Cineraria palustris Alpi∣na  and several little bellflowers and the more southward we travelled the more plants we met with in bloom  Having given no description of a particular way of catching sturgeon in the river Wolga with a tackling they call  snast  as I met with the same here in the river Irtish under the name of  samolowi  somewhat different from the snast of the Caspian sea the reader shall have it now The whole consists of a bast rope well tarred between twenty and forty fathoms long on which they fasten at the distance of six inches from each other if for small fish but at twelve inches if for large fish small cords likewise besmeared with tar on these strings they tie strong and sharp hooks four or five inches long greased with tallow to prevent rust in the middle of the curve of these hooks is a line of horse∣hair twisted having a small float at it's end of willow∣bark as light as cork After each tenth hook they fasten a stone on the last rope sufficient to sink it and at one end a wooden anchor to secure the whole at the other a rope with a basket or some other thing that will  and serve as a buoy In this state the tackling is cast into deep places in the stream let∣ting the anchor first down that the current may not carry it off By means of the floats to each hook the hooks are kept from touching the bottom and the sturgeon and husos which rove about the bottom beating the water with their flanks and tails are sure to hook themselves in one part or other so wounded they are more agitated beat and lash the water more and are by this means hooked in several other parts so as not to be able to escape The fishermen draw up  these ropes every day take off the fish caught and re∣place the rope in the water at night This fishery is continued all the summer In the Wolga they stretch such ropes across the whole arm of a river and in the Caspian sea bait the hooks with a small fish called an obla which bjelugas bite at and are caught by the throat as I have had occasion to speak of  In the banks of the Irtish are sometimes found teeth and other bones of elephants brought forth by the water  These have lain buried in the earth a long time and denote some extraordinary change in it as I shall speak further of hereafter  I met here also with a species of large yellowheaded lark  Ca∣landra  they are fond of flying about the road singly but do not fly high nor sing near so well as the field∣lark but like the latter build in the grass and feed upon grasshoppers and other small insects  On my arrival at Omskaja a fort on the river Irtish on the th of May I went to Major  Stanislasky's  to see some maps that had been made of Siberia convin∣ced there were such things in his possession left by the late General  Springer  who died just before we arrived and who was a lover of the science of geography Af∣ter waiting two days I was informed that without spe∣cial orders from Petersburgh I could not be shewn any of them Notwithstanding all I could say I could not get a sight of those which I wanted to see and from  this I collected that the commanders here disliked my tour and the business I was entrusted with Indeed till the day of my departure I could obtain nothing but an order for a change of horses at different places and these the worst in the garrison and in this order they left it to the option of those officers who com∣manded the forts I was to travel through whether they would supply me with regimental horses or not I dreaded therefore every possible obstacle and this cold and ungentlemanlike reception the more surprized me as I had been every where else loaded with all imaginable civility and kindness by the governors and commandingofficers where I passed I considered this however as a new proof of the old truth that the God of War is no friend to the Muses  I remained however at Omskaja to repair and re∣fit till the d Omskaja has it's name from the river Om being situated near it's mouth into the Irtish A new fort has been here erected by LieutenantGeneral  Springer  the old one having been entirely decayed and is well fortified according to the rules of modern for∣tification It was begun in and in great for∣wardness when I was there Within it is a handsome mansion for the governor with a stone foundation a courtmartial and a military storehouse with artillery a house for the chief priest and several streets of well∣built houses a fine stonebuilt church a militaryaca∣demy a house for the reception of strangers of distinc∣tion  and one for the protestant preacher of the Siberian division besides other houses for officers c On the Irtish lies within the fort the magazine of provisions and in the chief square of the fort are several fine fountains In short it has the appearance of a fine city Part of the old fort will be demolished with the old cathedral and the churchyard only left where a monument has been erected to General  Springer  Forty miles from Omskaja where I arrived on the d of May is a guard station where a new fort is built and the place is colonized with a number of ex∣iled Tartars sent here to carry on the works at Om∣skaja Near this post an English officer who former∣ly commanded here has made a fine kitchengarden The sand taken out from the ditch of the redoubt is  ed with  Tellin  muscles half calcined often met with on the higher shores of the Irtish but never in the river itself and are incontestably a marine production Put the most remarkable circumstance is there being only this single species of muscleshells to be found throughout the sandy steps upon the Irtish without any other trace of petrified seabodies and it is no less worthy the notice of a naturalist that they are found abundantly quite near the surface of the earth whilst the borders of the river which consist of sand and loam and the other steps wherein they are found are six eight my even ten fathoms above the highest le∣vel of the water  I never met any where with so great a number of waterswallows as about the highshores of the Irtisch In many places their holes and nests are so near each other that if one stands on the brink of the shore and treads a little hard they will swarm out in crowds and hover about like flies Here also builds the houseswallow her nest with the waterswallow The former makes a hole in the land but not so deep as the latter The houseswallow's hole is merely large enough for ner nest These two species of swallows are found here in abundance but they do not like to mix One spot shall be found full of the nests of the waterswal∣low and another of the houseswallow  In our way from Omskaja we passed many scattered tumuli about ninety miles from that place these tu∣muli are not raised so high as in general they are flat and of mean appearance and the body not buried more than eighteen or twenty inches deep the bones how∣ever that we found were quite sound The head lies to the west and they are probably the graves of the idolatrous Barabynian Tartars Valuable things are not commonly found herein but in some they have found copper and in some few better metals  The high sandy shores of the Irtisch which are mixed with loam lie mostly in layers and seem to have been carried there by the deluge One layer near eight fathoms or more above the highest water∣mark  is mixed with the tellinae I have mentioned Most of them are calcined but have preserved some∣thing of their outward hornlike upperskin These very layers in which the muscles are dispersed contain all sorts of bones some of elephants and some of other animals nay even the bones of fishheads of course they must have been brought hither by some vast inun∣dation or it is a proof that the sea formerly stretched itself entirely over these plains It is not the river that causes here such great sinkings or excavations of the ground as we meet with but strong subterranean springs that gush forth in inconceivable streams from underneath the high sandy layers and from a grey clay that does not lie much higher than the level of the water These streams are of a brackish taste and it leads me to think they must proceed from the great lake I have mentioned Indeed it is very dangerous to travel over many spots of the lowshore as one often sinks suddenly into a bottomless swamp  Between thirty and forty miles from the Irtisch are three large saltlakes where the purest and finest com∣mon salt lies at the bottom of the whole lakes a foot in thickness but in less quantity near the shore The largest of these lakes is about two miles long and a∣bout fathoms over in serene weather the water has a bloodred appearance though it is perfectly transparent A guard of Tartarian Cossacks is placed here to prevent the salt being taken away to the in∣jury  of the revenue and have habitations adjoining them Here I met with in the wet lowlands a weed called the  Acorus  which is dug up by travellers in or∣der to preserve furs from the moth and which they assured me was very efficacious  Travelling on by the Irtisch I met with more ele∣phantbones and a shoulderbone which seemed to belong to a buffalo also some large animal skulls of which there is now no animal so large in all Asia I passed over a step where a number of horses lay a∣bout dead which died of the airplague They lay in such numbers as to resemble a field of battle  In the fort Korjakofskoi which is one of the most populous on the Irtisch and the best built commanded by a LieutenantColonel are two saltmagazines be∣longing to the crown and always containing a provisi∣on of some hundred thousands puds of salt for a supply in case of want These stores lay in large heaps co∣vered with mats ready for transportation in barges to the Irtisch which lies at the distance of about sixteen miles Each barge will carry from to puds and down the Irtisch it is conveyed to the Imperial saltoffice not far from Tobolskaja  If it was not for several plants that grow on these sandy steps such as the  Axyris ceratoides  the Siberian centaury and the wonderful wild liquorice  Astralagus  the sand would not be sufficiently solid to pass over but this astralagus grows between the sandhills creep∣ing with numberless thin divided twigs through the sand gathering itself round it and thus forming hil∣locks from four to six feet in diameter the small grey leaves of this plant covering the sand entirely The bloom scarce rises above the ground but it is di∣rectly covered with sand and the little cods that hold the seed ripen under the sand I believe this fine plant hitherto unknown to botanists is very useful in rendering the quicksands firm And here we saw first that fine and new species of mice  Mus arena∣rius  The cods of the wild liquorice is their natural food  In some spots of these sandy desarts I saw such crowds of grashoppers as covered the earth quite black in tracts from fifty to sixty fathoms These were un∣winged but I could see by crowds that were winged and whose wings were of a palered that they were the  Cryllus Italicus  of Linnaeus This insect was here in such vast abundance upon whole tracts of dry and sandy hills as to have devoured every green plant and herb except the sandwort the sharp pasqueflower  Pulsatilla  and old wormwoodstalks they had even eat the milkthistle  I could not but take notice and I mention it on account of it's rareness of a large wolf advancing  near the road and starting before us a breeding duck this animal looked at us a little while with a great deal of phlegm without being in the least dismayed at our noise after this went slowly on behind us and crossed the road with equal coolness The conduct of such an animal so shy in the sight of men in summer is remarkable  Wherever we passed during the hot days of June we were dinged with the noise of little crickets and I could not help thinking with enthusiasm of the Poet's description  Strident arbusta Cicadis  "The shady groves with crickets chirp"  The th of June was sultry almost to suffocation yet  De L'Isle's  thermometer in the shade pointed at deg But we rode along some very dry and stony mountains that reflected the rays of the sun and added to the natural heat Nothing green could be seen but bushes of wild roses the thrift  Spirea  and the scarlet  Convolvulus frutescens  The mountains consist here of a solid chalkstone which is broken and burnt on the spot by transported miscreants Here also are Cossacks employed in felling wood which number is changed every three years Among these a Tartarian Orpheus who played us a tune on a Kir∣guisian  fiddle but not with sufficient charms to move the stones This instrument is a monochord of two unequal strains in form of a lute the belly of which is narrow from below and but half covered with a sounding bottom The strings are horsehair and it is played with a horsehair bow and when sounded re∣sembles the singing of swans indeed the instrument bears much the similitude of a swan  On the st I was at the sort Semipalatnaja where Dr  Gmelin  has described as situated some ruins of an∣cient buildings Some of these I saw but one or two which he describes I could not meet with or they must have been obliterated since he was there I slop∣ped here in order to make an excursion and take a view of them About seven miles from this place we drew near the Irtish and about a mile further we saw these ruins on a high border which consists of slaterocks and on which is a picketguard Here are the remains of three buildings the structure of which is mean and appears to be Bucharian and the buildings are disposed without any order The first is a wretched quadran∣gular hut fathoms distant from the others without windows built with unburnt bricks nineteen feet square with a very low and narrow gate on the western side towards the river and three airholes on the south∣ern side The roof is planks overspread with loam and broke in Of the other two the walls only are standing part of which is built of those thin slates of  which the mountain consists fitted together as well as possible and cemented with loam instead of mortar  Seven miles from the guardstation on the Irtish is the bartering market where trade is carried on between the Asiatic merchants and the Kirguese This place consists of a certain number of little wooden houses or booths divided into several streets and encompassed with a ditch and chevauxdefrize and are inhabited or destined for storehouses by native Russian or Tar∣tarian merchants or such Bucharians as arrive with caravans Over the Irtish is a ferry and on the op∣posite shore are some huts erected purposely for Kir∣guisian commerce Most of the Bucharians come from Taschkent in Little Bucharia and there were when I was there some caravans with ordinary cotton goods This people is more obstinate and uncivilized than those from Great Bucharia The bartering trade carried on with the Kirguese is most advantageous to the inland merchants because these Kirguese being of the middle horde and living on the Irtish are very sim∣ple and take trifles at a high rate for their cattle so that the merchants notwithstanding their long journey to this place get a great deal by what they purchase The Kirguisian sheep are here of two kinds a large species and a smaller one like those of the Kalmucks Horses are sold here from four to fifteen and twenty ru∣bles each horned cattle from two to four rubles each and sheep from thirty to seventy copecs apiece  On the d I set out in the afternoon and our horses were so bad that they could scarce draw our waggons over the sandhills It was night when we passed the last at seven miles from the fort Two of the waggons were obliged to stop at the first sandhill the horses being knocked up whilst I took up my lodging in the woods and was unable to proceed any further till noon the next day The rest of the road to Osernoi Staniz where I was going is tolerably le∣vel and we met with nothing worth notice in our way but a tumulus on which stood a stone with the princi∣pal features of a man's face carved on it It was thir∣teen inches broad fifteen long and four and a half thick  The many changes of heat and cold which I subject∣ed myself to when I left my waggons in order to search for plants and the daily cold and stormy show∣ers to which I was exposed brought on a dysentery and made me so weak that I could get scarce up and down from the waggon but as I determined to rest myself at Krasnojarskaja I made the best of my way there and with as much expedition as my painful situation would admit It was at the distance of twentyseven miles and I got there on the th of June In my road I passed an enormous tumulus raised on the highest spot of the whole district and was told it had once been opened by a body of peasants and these diggers of hidden treasures found in it no less than  fortysix pounds of gold which they shared among them  The gold found in these graves the many mines that have been here opened and the scattered tumuli representing the beds of rest of the ancient Teutonic heroes with the fashion of their tools arms and furni∣ture found within puts it beyond a doubt that the metallic mountains of the Irtish and Jenesei were for∣merly worked by one and the same nation  Krasnojarskaja was a bad place and a very unfit abode for me in my disorder to halt at as the water was unwholesome and the refracted heat of the adjacent mountains injurious but I could get no further and was confined to my bed for three weeks However that I might lose no time I sent Mr  Sokolof  off in company with my draftsman on the th of July in order to describe the districts on both sides of the Irtish with orders to meet me on the serpentmountain where I hoped to be able to wait for him  Krasnojarskaja is a newerected village like many others that have been built since the year and colonized partly with Polish emigrants of Russian ex∣traction and of the old Greek religion partly with peasants from the innermost parts of Russia or such who for little misdeamesnors have been here exiled partly also with voluntary colonists from the more  populous parts of Siberia This village has been erec∣ted but three years and has at present only twenty houses most of the inhabitants are exiles to whom the Empress has been pleased to restore their liberty and enable them once more to enjoy the sweets of domestic life by peopling this desart part of the world The clemency and philanthropy of the Mother of this country has extended so far as to supply these wretches like other colonists for the first three years with mo∣ney and provision monthly and such wise proceed∣ings will doubtless render these districts in time as populous as other parts of Siberia Indeed most of these new villages are so happily situated for agricul∣ture that the inhabitants cannot but be prosperous The only complaint of this and other villages situated on the Uba is the unwholesomeness of it's water which is apt to cause fevers especially to strangers and as the country folks here imprudently nurse such fevers by astringents it brings on lameness and other nervous effects And yet the people seem rather dis∣posed to use this water than search for good wells My whole retinue suffered by drinking it Every man except one was afflicted with a fever so irregular that no remedies could cure it After we left the place the disorder lurked about them for three weeks  July  We left Krasnojarskaja on the th travelled up the Uba and visited the lead∣mines in which is found copper and a small quantity  of silver and on the th Mr  Sokolof  joined us He had travelled down the Uba and brought me an ac∣count of a great curiosity in the district of Ustkame∣nogorskaja to be seen in the remains of a fortified Kal∣muck Pagoda which goes by the name of  Ablaikit  The Pagoda Ablaikit lies out from the frontiers of the Russian empire on the left side of the Irtisch in a desart formerly inhabited by the Dsungorian Kalmucks but now by the middle horde of the Kirguese The history of it's building by  Ablai  a Prince of the Kal∣mucks and it's destruction may be seen in a remark∣able treatise written by counsellor  Muller  and pub∣lished among the works of the Imperial Academy of Sciences at Petersburgh and also in the tour of Mr  Gmelin  It is in ruins but the ruins shew that all the magnificence of an uncivilized Asiatic people is capable of has been lavished upon it  After having taken Mr  Sokolof  's baggage into my waggons we set off on the th of July for the SerpentMountain We crossed the river Alei and came into a deep valley encompassed on all sides with steep and rocky mountains a vale delightfully cool and refresh∣ing in arid sultry weather enamelled with flowers and frequented by all sorts of wild fowl which renders it throughout the year an agreeable place to the neighbouring people must furnish their tables with the  most delicate productions and afford them comforts which even a prince might envy  The mountains here are covered with birch and pop∣lars wild roses and rasberrybushes a fruit the bears are very fond of and will very often take them from women and children who go out to gather them with∣out doing them any harm neither will they in sum∣mer attack any man unless much provoked From the heights of Ossinowa Gora we had an awful sight of the steep and rocky towering clifts of the adjacent mountain called in Russ  Bjelki  whose top was co∣vered with snow and which may be seen at seventyfive miles distance This mountain is called the SnowMountain is much torn and it's ascent so steep as to have one precipice or rockwall fathoms in per∣pendicular height each fathom seven feet English down which tumbles the river Tigerak with a tre∣mendous roar This river is here fifteen fathoms wide and prodigiously rapid Before we reach this precipice which is accessible only in two places we descry at a distance another enormous mountain whose conical summit rises in a stupendous rocky py∣ramid far above the clouds These mountains and their gigantic brethren appeared now more dreadful as many gloomy thunderclouds gathered round their tops and brought on continual rain till the d of Aug when the sky cleared up See the plate  THE SNOW MOUNTAIN STONE HARE  As we rode from the mountain Ossinowa Gora to the next post the open valleys on our left exhibited a delightful and unexpected change in the vegetable kingdom We had not seen a remarkable plant for some time and all the grass had lost it's verdure but here the mountains and vallies were covered with a vernal green like spring and numberless planes were in bloom The most remarkable were the fellwort  Gentiana verna  the catmint  Nepeta multifida  the dragon's head  Dracocephalum peregrinum  the bitter vetch  Orobus lathyroides  the French honeysuckle  Hedysarum Alpinum  the liquorice  Astraga∣lus Syriacus  the John'swort  Hyperycum Ascyron  the rhubarb  Rheum undulatum  which often grows out from the bare clefts of the rock the milkwort  Polygala Sybirica  and the cinquefoil  Potentilla fruticosa  which grew like bushes with high rods and decorated the vallies every where also many spe∣cies of  Abrotonum  several sorts of wild leeks and a small species of swordgrass which  Linnaeus  has taken no notice of it is a common plant and has very few flowers Among other plants in this district an ele∣gant one and hitherto unknown to botanists is the  Spi∣rea  with thick rods which the Cossack hunters make use of as ramrods to their firelocks  This district was in every respect so very remark∣able that I wished to have been here a month sooner to have climbed up the  ountains myself which my  illness had now rendered me too infirm to do indeed I was so weak as not to be able to walk half a mile I dispatched therefore Mr  Sokolof  with a huntsman and an escort of Cossacks to the high mountains and visited the lower ones and their caverns myself in which I found a number of stoneswallow'snests  Hi∣rundo alpestris  the pellitory  Parietaria  and little stinking figwort  Scrophularia  with white blossoms growing upon the stones In one cavern whose en∣trance was twentysix feet broad and sixteen feet high somewhat wider in it's continuation and running feet right into the mountain I found many human bones and some few little trifles carved in wood per∣haps some superstitious ornaments of the Kalmucks Here I met with three Kalmuck skulls and I will de∣clare them to be Kalmuck as from the flatness of the skull they are distinguishable from those of any other men These bodies were perhaps here placed by a peculiar order of the priests or some Kalmucks might have been killed in this cavern by accident On the rock without grew plentifully the sasifrage  Saxi∣fraga crassifolia  vulgarly called there the Mongali∣an tea for as the trade with China was for some time interrupted and the tea that was imported at Petersburgh and Archangel too dear in these re∣mote districts this plant was introduced by the name of Tsahagirian tea and the people learned from the Mongols and Siberian Tartars to boil it like common tea It's leaves do not fade and die in one year but  become only dry and brown afterwards blackish and it is four years before they drop off entirely It gives the water a red teacolour with a taste like that of bad bohea which if the plant is not too much boiled is tolerable but not so good that any one would take it in preference to other tea The fresh leaves like the roots of this plant are uncommonly bitter and styptic of course are not fit to be taken It is however worth trial whether this plant which I found antisep∣tic in the highest degree is not a good remedy in fe∣vers I am confident it possesses some medicinal vir∣tue It is found here on the north side of all rocky mountains in vast quantities  On the st of August Mr  Sokolof  returned from his troublesome tour his companion not knowing his way They climbed up a mountain covered with larches firs and pines and so much bewildered with bushes that their cloaths were torn to rags The most curious thing he brought me was a species of stonehare  Lepus Alpinus  which lives about the rocky brooks of the high mountains and is common in all the eastern mountains of Siberia They are not much larger than a guineapig weigh about fifteen ounces are of a yellowish colour have large round ears and instead of a tail a little lump of fat See the plate and the description at the end of this volume They inhabit the clefts of rocks if the weather be soggy will set the whole day in the open air but towards  night retire on the outside of those clifts that project from the grass and whistle They will then suffer a person to approach them very near but if shot at will throw themselves into their clefts yet appear again soon after A wonderful quality of this animal is their mowing the grass after the month of July with their teeth and carrying it as a winterprovision of hay in heaps into their clefts so that one may dis∣cover the dwellings of these animals by the heaps of grass on the rocks This animal reminds me to ob∣serve that though they abound in the wild frontiermountains they are almost lost within the frontiers as the country there is more populous For this rea∣son sportsmen in the favourable season for catching them go with the leave of the commanding officers without the frontiers into desart and woody districts where they find them in plenty They catch here also a number of fables whose skins are shorthaired but very fine and black and also a great quantity of martens which further northward in Siberia are not to be met with and are very rare in the upper district of the river Jenisei Another species of little forestanimal whose reddish fur is but of little value and costs here four or five copecs each is what they call  Kulonki  a species of weasel not yet described which is very abundant about the Jenisei and no where else to be seen but in the woody districts of Siberia It's name is of Tartarian origin and implies a glutton it having been observed that this animal if caught in a snare or  trap withot her animals and not soon taken out will de∣vour all that is with it It steals like the polecat in∣to villages and robs the peasants of meat butter and other provisions The Cossacks quartered here on the lines catch stags elks and bears in covered pits they also kill them with firearms They fix the gun upon a fork cock it and to the trigger fasten a string which is turned round a peg in the ground behind it and put across the spot where the animal must pass which if it does it touches the string discharges the piece and shoots itself There are also wild boars in the miry districts of the high mountains and abundance of good foxes lynxes and squirrels and along the mountainwaters otters and beavers The stonerams  musimon  dwell only on the highest and most inaccessible rocks never feeding in inhabited places The chamois seems to be wanting here but probably a few may be found on the mountains as I received a horn of one from the Jenesei and on the copper pieces dug out of the tumuli the figure of the chamois is very common  It occasionally happens that for some bad trick and through a love of independence miners will run from the mines and dwell a long time in the woody mountains thriving and growing rich by hunting Such runaways have been discovered who have built huts in the wildest places without the frontiers In search of such colonists detachments of troops are occasionally  sent far into the mountains where they have found hermits who from fantastic zeal have left their vil∣lages and settled in these inaccessible parts  It is plainly visible that on chalk mountains all wild plants become much finer and more perfect which may be attributed to the nature of this species of rocks which strongly attracts the moisture of the air clouds and fogs and absorbs that attracted moist∣ness so as not to let the plants have too much wet  In this district I passed an old deserted coppermine in which silver was found that had been worked by  Dimidoff  and a manufactory adjoining it the dwell∣ings of which were now only inhabited by husband∣men In my road on about miles before we reach∣ed the serpentmountain the banks of the river Alei are covered with wood in which there are a great many white poplars and in the banks of the brook Bere∣soska which falls into the Alei and which consist of a kind of loam and underneath layers of sand we found enormous teeth of elephants and some remains of smaller animals Some peasants that rowed down this brook a fishing first discovered this curiosity seeing a large tooth of an elephant projecting from the sandy banks they drew it out I have seen a grinder sound here which seems like the tooth of some large buffalo but I cannot give it by my re∣membrance  to any known animal if it be not that of the rhinoceros  Serpentmountain  We reached the serpentmountain on the th of August It is so called from the innu∣merable serpents that were every where crawling about it till it was covered with mines I was shewed some sharp outstanding angles of rocks in which I saw smooth excavations as if polished which are said to have been made by these serpents who have now taken possession of a neighbouring mountain This moun∣tain by name Smejefskaja Gora deserves justly to be called the crown of all Siberian mines and if it was to be searched into with proper care and exactness would take up more time than a traveller would be able to bestow upon it I shall however mention circum∣stantially all the accounts and information I could gather respecting it and for which I am indebted to its director Mr  Leube  Before the year it was known that this moun∣tain was metallic for its old trying pits had been discovered before that time In Brigadier  Beier  ordered regular works to be undertaken Its distance from the Irtisch is miles and from the Oby which flows east and north from it miles It is encom∣passed all round with steep and torn mountains which form part of the Altai and between which the brook Korbolicha flows into the Alei part of these torn  mountains consists of chalk and state and contains some good ores yet far inferior in extent and rich∣ness to those of the serpentmountain  The serpentmountain is divided from all adjacent ones by a valley which draws towards the Korbolicha and rises to the perpendicular height of fathoms The whole mountain may be considered as a great stock covered with slates which consist of rich gold silver copper lead zinc arsenic and sulphur ores This stock has two divisions entirely separated with∣out by a depression or dale running from north to south and within the mountain by slaterocks The level part of this stock consists of chertz which with irregular sinuses and shelves runs northward into the depth but the hanging part of the mountain is a heavy and compact spar over which the slatemountain joins About the chertz the ores stick in stocks nests and branches so that it is commonly encompassed with a matrix of a richer and often nobler alloy than the ores themelves and a great deal of massive me∣tals The chertz in which the ores lie is in substance mostly like a solid firestone its color exposed to the air is yellowish further inwards light grey or blu∣ish In the neighbourhood of the ores it is more like metal in large pieces or nests and impregnated with a silvery black or enriched with massive gold or silver plates This quartz chertz or hornstein is  therefore a principal part of the works and contains a good deal of arsenic  The sparpart is very compact and solid of a grey or white color and uncommonly heavy great part of it is converted into metal and mixed with several ores The slate which lies on the spar is commonly at the day varicoloured and soft but in the depth solid thoroughly grey or blackish It often contains mar∣casites and pebbles of a very aquatic nature and care is to be taken not to advance very far into it To this care they owe the depth of the mine and its being worked with only a few handengines  Betwixt the chertz and the spar in the upper divi∣sions lay some rich yellow ochre to the depth of fathoms and in the lower fathoms in length in breadth and in depth between which and the chertz lay some white argil to the thickness of an ell In general the ores from the day to the depth of or fathoms were the richest and most ennobled with massive metals but at a greater depth the ores were poorer and less ripe and very seldom any traces of massive silver to be met with  There are many shafts dug in this mine that have been found very rich with silver but the hornstein or chertz dug here is immensely rich containing beau∣tiful ores in nests and bunches which are of consider∣able  alloy In the year they made a great adit which was completed in and runs to a depth of fathoms fathoms long having five airholes at a proper distance and opens with its mouth near the brook in the valley By means of this adit which in∣tersects the whole structure of the mine all the nu∣merous works above it from which the water was drawn in an expensive manner with handengines are now not only freed from water and fresh water pro∣cured in the whole mine but also the internal quality of the serpentmountain is still more known and a road made to the deepest works This adit or road has gone through fathoms of clay through fathoms further on of reddish slate then fathoms through chertz fathoms through spar and pebbleore five fathoms of empty spar and lastly through fathoms of a grey and black slate in the whole fathoms or yards  The works are here carried on with that regularity skill and order as may serve as an example to all other mines The deepest part of the works cannot be con∣tinued in any other manner than by blowing up the ores with gunpowder and they use here annually from to puds of powder for the purpose each pud pounds English  The ores hitherto dug in these important works contain an almost incredible variety of species The  metals and ores dug throughout the mine to this time are as follow  Massive gold  which lies mostly in the upper part of the mountain from the surface to a depth of fa∣thoms where the ores are the richest Its color is high and pure and it is found in a matrix of chertz brown ochre and lazuli more below it is very pale and impregnated with silver so that often one and the same bunch has three or more sorts of color It is found in irregular grains and pieces of different yet small size sometimes it is impregnated with particles of arsenic In many silverores it is so tenderly sprinkled in that it can hardly be discerned with a magnifyingglass yet if it be true that no gold is found changed into ore it must be scattered massively in all ores of this mine Most of the massive gold is found here visibly in the chertz and the fine sandrock also in brown ochre and rich lazuli bunches of both the latter have been found underneath the day ores quite covered with veins of massive gold Massive gold is also here found in veins and pebbleores  Massive silver  which has commonly some gold in it is found in pieces and threads of different sizes in kid∣ney and clefts It commonly occurs in chertz spar different species of sparores pebble and silvery copper∣ores also in loam and argyl The richest chertzores contain a great deal of massive silver and plates of  the same have also been found in the upper works upon loam and verdigrease The hairsilver never occurs in very large threads There are also black chertzkidneys with massive silver plates in them  Massive copper  is in metallic and small pieces of irregular figure only in the upper part of the moun∣tain In some places it lies in white and green loams in others in green silver and coppery sparores and carries with it a degree of silver It is also dug in tender plates upon sparores nestwise  Other ores dug in this mine as pebble arsenic lead c all contain a degree of silver and some have gold In an assay made of puds of dug ore there was found puds of black copper six puds nine pounds and better of silver and upwards of three pounds of gold Some produce one pound of silver in pounds of ore some more some less In the leadore a number of beautiful coloured crystals are found  As a curiosity of the serpentmountain it deserves to be mentioned that a piece of a grinder of an elephant also a piece of fungites were found in one of the shafts which plainly prove its origin from the sea I saw them both and I doubt not but other such re∣mains might be found if properly looked after  The tracts of the ancient workmen noticed in these mines are too remarkable not to be mentioned The upper and lower division of the ores of this mountain were not known to these ancient miners They made deep trying pits into the soft and rich ochreores and clays situated near the surface and made shafts upon them to the depth of five fathoms and more but to penetrate into the solid ores they had neither means nor tools Many of their tools have been found in the modern works several were cast in copper which leads me to think that iron was un∣known to them and indeed the copper knives dag∣gers and arrows found in the ancient tombs in the step of the Irtisch is an incontestable proof of it A few years since they found a half metallized skeleton of an ancient miner who was probably squeezed to death by the falling in of a shaft about him was a leather bag of the most precious ochre Between the mouth of one of the shafts and the stamping mills that formerly stood on the adjoining brook they found at the distance of more than fathoms one of their washingplaces which still contained so much gold as to make it requisite to pass the rubbish through the modern lavatories in order not to lose such a treasure  But notwithstanding this we can form a conjecture who the ancient nation so skilled in mineralogy may have been The Russians in Siberia call them  Tschudaki  which implies an old nation They cannot have been Tartars or Mongols because these nations have been acquainted time out of mind with the melting of iron and yet are unacquainted with the melting of copper or other precious metals nay even of digging them Probably this nation might have been driven from their ancient abodes which they occupied along the Siberian mountains or may have been destroyed by the wandering Mongols and Tar∣tars This is probable from the fine and delightful mountains about the Jenisei and from the many magnificent tumuli in which gold and other valuable things have been discovered All the tools found about the Jenesei shew also more art and splendor than those on the Irtisch which are clumsy and heavy But no where do we meet with traces of stonebuild∣ings or other habitations which might be attributed to that people who were probably Nomades and whose way of life gave the best opportunity of discovering ores What then was that nation so skilled in mi∣neralogy Were they the Parthians lost in history or were they the Germans Their descendants perhaps may think the supposition too romantic  In the old mineworks of the nation I have been speaking of some timber has been found three or four fathoms deep in the ores quite metallized and converted into copper with silver alloy and some that contained little plates and threads of massive copper  and gold This serpentmountain of all the dis∣covered mines has for the last years produced the most important treasures and the imperial silvermanufactories on the Ob have been chiefly sup∣ported by it As Mr  Gmelin  has observed it is the first of all Siberian mines where the ores to a prodigious depth have kept constant To give the reader a proper idea of the great production of this mine I shall briefly tell him that from the year to they sent annually from two to four hund∣red and since from to nay even puds of gold and silver each pud pounds and in all since the beginning of the silverworks above puds of raw silver which was converted into puds of gold and above puds of refined silver The transport of the ores to the manufactories is done by voluntary waggons or peasants working to pay their polltax The carriage from the serpentmoun∣tain to the manufactories is from five copecs to seven per pud according to the distance and badness of the roads  On the top of this mountain is a fortress to guard it in form of a polygon which encompasses the upper works and extends itself mostly over the south and east sides of it so that the great works with some adjacent storehouses forges and other wateringplaces lie without the sortress on the western side The fortress has two stonebastions on the top of the  mountain besides an earthwall with two bastions in the northern angles and half a bastion in the southern The principal buildings are the house of the com∣mandingofficer that of the chief director the comp∣toir where a great train of artillery is kept the new laboratory of assays which contains a curious and beautiful collection of ores a schoolhouse and an hospital Besides these there are storehouses maga∣zines and five dwellinghouses for the officers several private houses and stables The foundation of a beautiful stonebuilt church upon a modern plan is laid but till the building is completed they make use of a timber one The Smei forms a canal within the walls of the fortress its water fills the ditches and the fortress itself and the suburbs have several wells of fine wholesome water The suburbs lie on the north and east sides of the fortress quite down to the valley and towards the adjacent heights and are laid out in regular sheets one of which is three quarters of a mile long The number of houses amounted to and the place is encreasing daily  The direction of the whole mine is under the cele∣brated Colonel  Leube  who before the year was the German preacher of this place Under him is a captaindirector of the works a master of assays several other officers and clerks The miners are in number and above more employed in the lavatories Several hundred peasants are con∣stantly  felling timber and the garrison consists of men commanded by a captain  As the spar chertz loam and other rubbish dug out with the ore are of a metallic nature but not of sufficient value to pay the expence of transporting and melting there is established in the neighbourhood five stampingmills and five lavatories for grinding and washing such ores of small alloy and every thing is so contrived that the works are not suspended even in win∣ter To prevent the canals that work the mills from freezing they are covered with sprays and hay and the lavatories are heated by ovens  The lavatories or washinghouses produce annual∣ly a considerable quantity of golddust and some∣times they find in the rubbish small pieces of solid silver Since they have produced puds and six pounds of golddust which is sent to the Imperial Treasury of Mines at Catherineburg and since the new stampingmill has been erected it has produced in one year above thirtyseven puds extra  Before I quit this mountain I will mention two re∣markable occurrencesThe one is that in the course of this year several shocks of an earthquake were here felt and the other that inoculation for the small∣pox introduced in children and adults was so success∣fully performed here by a Russian surgeon in  whose name is  Timofei Andréjef  that out of persons not a single one died The greatest number was inoculated on the mountain itself and the rest in the neighbouring villages So happy an experiment in Siberia surely deserves a reward  I am indebted to Mr  Leube  for the observations on the earthquake felt here on the th of February of the present year The motion was like a fluctu∣ation of the earth and passed from North to South On the th of February the night before the earth∣quake the quicksilver of the barometer fell half an inch during the whole night a violent southwind blew and at five in the morning fell some snow to the depth of four inches and continued on the th in the morning during a great temperature of the air Then the usual winterweather continued to the d the sky was cloudy and the south and north wind blew by turns but on the d came such a lasting frost that the mercury in  de Lisie's  thermometer stood between deg to deg till the d of March The shocks shook the works and workmen without doing any damage and in the houses at the silvermanufac∣tory at Barnaul at the distance of miles all the instruments and furniture were waved several times backwards and forwards  On the th of August I left the serpentmountain in my way to the silvermanufactory at Barnaul dis∣tant  miles and thence to Tomskoi miles further  Travelling on I passed some tumuli on the th and st of August consisting of a heap of stones co∣vered with earth in which were found shinbones and backbones of men of a gigantic size I crossed the Alei near the village Kaschina about miles from the serpentmountain which has a fine stonebuilt church a bailiff and several villages dependent on it I changed horses here and sent my waggons on the straightest road wandering myself through all the environs  I reached Barnaulskoi on the d one day after Professor  Falk  who arrived so much indisposed as to take to his bed Meaning to stop here but a few days I was desirous of seeing the works as soon as possible and MajorGeneral  Yhrmann  commanderinchief of the garrisons quartered on the mountains gave me every assistance in his power I therefore sat up the whole night writing and drawing what I have here communicated  Rich and important as the serpentmountain is in ores is this place in it's works Here the chief melting and refining of the gold and silverores brought from that mountain is performed Here also are the headquarters of the regiments and the chief mineoffice  of the whole district It's first establishment was when  Dimidof  possessed all the mines of the Altai The works were increased in and the two manufac∣tories of Nowopawlofskoi and Susunskoi were esta∣blished in the same year Barnaul at first had only six blasts and three refining hearths The ores are conveyed on the rivers Alei and Tscharysch to save the great expence of landcarriage  The manufactory of Barnaulskoi is built on a brook of the same name near the mouth of the river Ob The head of water pent up for the mills is fathoms long and thirteen broad and the reservoir has so much water as to supply the works throughout the year with∣out the least suspension All the huts or covered places for materials are situated according to the best order and disposition They are built of wood and encompassed with a wall The principal street consists of a beautiful townhouse a mineoffice a school and the barracks The places worked by water are two smeltinghouses one with thirty blasts a stampingmill a forging and refining hearth a sawmill a cornmill a groatmill a polishing mill and two other stamping mills The other offices are an assayhouse with six blasts a 'comptinghouse a small forge a lock∣smith's workshop and a bellowsfactory A treasury is going to be built and a place to keep the archives of the manufactory Near the dwellinghouses for the workmen are magazines for provisions corn hay c  On the other side of the dam head is a fine newbuilt mansion for the commanderinchief and close by several fine houses belonging to the military officers Here is also a court of sworn citizens a market an hospital a stonebuilt public apothecary's shop a bo∣tanic garden storehouses powder and artillery ma∣gazines and the caserns of the garrison The num∣ber of other dwellinghouses amounts to The place has also two wooden churches but they have begun a fine stonebuilt church on a magnificent plan which will be one of the greatest ornaments of the country  The supreme mineoffice being here established there is a council held by authority of the Empress which not only commands all the mines of Altai and the silvermanufactories on the Ob but all the officers and workmen and above peasants from the districts of Tomskoi and Kusnezkaja who are obliged to work here for their polltax These peasants are very li∣berally paid and as their homes are sometimes at a very considerable distance they receive a competent allowance for coming and returning all regulated by the wise administration of General  Yhrmann  The hos∣pital is established on very philanthropic principles it has a chief surgeon and six under surgeons and on account of the German works there carried on they have a Protestant preacher The garrison here quartered as a guard to the place consists of a com∣pany  of dragoons and three companies of footsoldiers commanded by a major who are paid as if in camp The number of masters and workmen amounts to and their children are not only instructed in reading and writing but in merchantsaccompts and geometry  They use here annually from to baskets of charcoal and to make of such baskets it takes cubic fathoms of wood but the price of such a basket is not more than or copecs about pence English and they sell annually from to puds of lead In the last eight months they had already past through furnaces for the melting of raw ores puds of ore  Besides these works in Barnaul there are others in the neighbourhood close by such as nine limekilns a bellfoundery a brickkiln fathoms long and also eight other kilns joined together in which they burn with one fire which does not last above three or four days from to tiles also a glassmanufactory At a little distance from Bernaul is a countryhouse belonging to the general called Charlottedale superbly furnished with a park and extensive gardens in which are many beautiful cas∣cades fountains and statues Adjoining Bernaul is a brewhouse belonging to the crown The sale of strong beer is prohibited here but on certain days of festi∣vity  or the workmen would drink too freely and neglect their duty Notwithstanding the northern situ∣ation of this town it enjoys a milder air and warmer summers than the more southern districts A proof of which is that all gardenstuff except colliflowers thrive here amazingly The sandy and elevated district and the shelter of a dry forest contributes much towards it The only defect in the situation is that the water every where has a bitterish taste  I lest Barnaulskoi on the th of August and di∣rected my road to the silvermanufactory at NowoPawlofski where I arrived the next day saw as I passed a lake whose appearance at a distance was blood red and met with in the forest a peculiar species of mice  Mus Barabensis  various remarkable agarics among which there was  Lycopendon stellatum  and a particular species of  Hydnum  NowoPawlofski is one of the manufactories lately established as an auxiliary to Barnaul and promises to be a populous place It has a conveniency of water and every work and mill proper for the business to enumerate them would be needless Nothing is here performed but smelting of raw ores In the structure of their furnaces they keep off the vapours of ar∣senic which would be hurtful to the workmen but from the roasting of ores in the fields the air is so poisoned by the smoke that a great number of chicken  and other poultry are killed by convulsive dis∣orders  On the th I set off for Tomskoi and took Su∣sunskoi in my way which lies lower down the river Ob at the distance of miles and where is a Si∣berian mint The Ob is larger than the Irtisch and equal to the Wolga in its greatest breadth The villages and most of the towns in these districts are happily situated along the river and enriched by agri∣culture hunting and fishing for they sell their corn at a good price to the silverworks and the fortresses along the Irtisch The soil here is uncommonly fer∣tile though the black earth is not above six or seven inches deep yet there is beneath it a marly loam that makes the corn thrive exceedingly The peasants along the Ob were till late very rich in cattle especially in stout laborious horses but within a few years back the plague has raged among the horses and large cattle and they have sustained great losses They have a custom here to turn great troops or herds of horses loose into the forest without any one to look after them In the Barabynian step situate between the Ob and the Irtisch there are also wild horses called  Ditschje  which run in herds and the stallions that keep forward looking out as spies to ex∣plore the enemy are commonly shot They are mostly of a brown fallow and dun colour The peasants get also a great deal of money by catching squirrels which  are very abundant in the woods of this district they are large handsome and white and their furs are purchased by the Chinese at a price equal to ermine The distance from the Ob to the Irtisch is between and miles  I reached Susunskoi on the th of August This manufactory was established in March for smelt∣ing raw ores but in they added to it a mint It lies on the river Susun but they have erected a milldam which is fathoms long and broad Here with the copper of gold and silver alloy received from the silvermanufactories they coin a money cur∣rent in Siberia for as in the beginning of the silverworks here they had collected above puds of copper wherein were about three puds and an half of silver and about three puds of gold which to separate would have cost more than it was worth her Im∣perial Majesty issued an edict in that in future all such silvery copper should be coined into a cur∣rency with the Siberian arms on it according to its intrinsic value in the following pieces  viz  griws or ten copec pieces five ditto two ditto or groschewiki copecs half copecs or denuschki and quartercopecs or poluschki of which one part should serve to pay the Siberian regiments and the rest the workmen and other expences of the mines and manufactories The sum annually to be coined was fixed at rubles  The court of the mint is encompassed with a high Ostrog  Ostrog is a high wall made with the bodies of trees set upright standing close together used here formerly to fortify small places but at present only about storehouses and prisons  and has but one entrance which is guarded Within it are besides the payoffice guardroom and coalhouse a forge with a large hammer and two fur∣naces where the great tools are forged a smith's workshop where the stamps and punches are made a smeltinghouse with a lathe worked by water to turn cylinders and the extensive building of the mint consisting of several divisions In the mint are four divisions one has three flatting hammers with two glow furnaces two of which beat the copper into plates In the second are three flatting machines to give the plates their proper thickness The third division con∣tains eight machines to cut the plates into round pieces and the fourth six stamping machines the whole worked by water  The stamp of the coin is uniform having on one side the Empress's name E II surrounded with laurels and palms and on the reverse a crowned car∣touch borne by two sables the supporters of the Si∣berian arms and in the field of the cartouch is ex∣pressed the value of the coin and the year with the words  Sibirskaja Moneta  round it in the characters of  that country In this mint was struck in the years and rubles in and in rubles and some copecs in all rubles each ruble s d English Here are a fine church several good public offices and about houses some beautiful meadows and the place is truly delightful  Among all the Imperial manufactories situated on the Ob this is the richest in wood and will never want any Though a small part of the forest consists of poplars and birches especially near the Ob yet further on are very fine timbertrees and the forest extends to above miles in length and as many in breadth without taking into the account other large forests lower down the Ob which are well adapted for new manufactories  I left Susunskoi on the th of August for Tom∣skoi The country between the two places is mostly covered with birchwood has a fine soil but not the hundredth part so well inhabited as it deserves The fieldmice had done a great deal of harm to the pre∣sent harvest and were every where in scores to be seen No species of fieldmice was more common than the yellow one with a black stripe down its back and some small ones quite yellow Siberia produces two species of fieldmice of its own similar to the com∣mon shorttailed groundmouse the one much larger  with its ears quite concealed and the other of a foxcolour  Having got down from my waggon on the d of September to gather some seeds and endeavouring to get up again I fell and dislocated my arm It swelled so much and gave me so much pain that I could not raise it and was obliged to wear it in a sling till winter  When I reached the river Tom which was on the th of September I found among the pebbles some beautiful cornelian stones and in Kaltai a village miles from Tomskoi I was shewn many very valuable ores found in the same river In this place its neighbourhood and in and about Tomskoi are set∣tled from six to families of Mahomedan Tartars They call themselves  Tschaty  and are in their dress and manners as also in their religion little different from those of Casan Their women contrary to the custom of other Tartars wear over their veil or tastar a calotte which has no opening in the top of the head but covers it intirely Their girls wear the same braiding their hair into three or more tresses and into tresses on the day of their marriage They are fond of being buried on the borders of some forest or wood and erect over their graves such du∣rable sheds of timber that a burialplace at a distance has the appearance of a village In their houses  especially in their summer rooms they have chimnies like the Baskirs They are good husbandmen and pay their poll or headtax with great chearfulness Instead of tea they drink an infusion of the roots of the tormentil  Tormentilla erecta  which when boiled dyes the water reddish gives it a very astringent taste and is drank without milk The chopped roots or stalks of wild roses used instead of tea by the Tartars of Casan have a far sweeter taste I saw also the following species of cinquefoil used by the Si∣berian Tartars instead of tea  Potentilla fruticosa  known in the remote parts of Siberia by the name of  Kurilskoi Tschai  and  Potentilla rupestris  which they call  Polewoi  or  meadowtea  boiling the whole plant with the flower as some do the sage  Phlomis tuberosa  On the th we crossed the river Tom in a ferry and the banks striking my attention I directed the watermen to row me to a particular spot which I exa∣mined and found the soil to consist of a blue pirytuous clay uncommonly rich in vitriol Some of the in∣habitants of Tomskoi gather this vitriolic substance in dry weather boil from it an impure yellow vitriol and sell it from to copecs a pud instead of the genuine Siberian stonebutter Even their yellow clay is of a vitriolic nature and in it is found kidneys of a slated stoneochre which burns red and is used by cotton and callicoprinters as a dye In the same yel∣lowclay lay layers or nests of an impure or bluish  but some very fine snowwhite porcelain earth which the inhabitants fetch in quantities to paint their ovens rooms c with and in these banks I found in some vitriolic slatelayers notwithstanding their perpen∣dicular folia and strata impressions of little marine bodies  Tomskoi lies on the right border of the river Tom about miles from its mouth into the river Ob on a very uneven soil and spreads itself in length of the river from south to north In the centre of the town is a high hill on which is a fortress erected years since with four towers two gates and a bellsteeple Within these is the woodbuilt cathedral the townhouse the house of archives and the treasury built of stone a storehouse where the furs brought as tribute are kept a decayed guardhouse and an alehouse where the Tartars bringing their tribute are regaled with beer Here are also several private houses the house of the waywods and a public prison In the northeast part of the town is the church of the Resurrection of Christ and without the town several saltmagazines The most important part of the town lay beyond the mountain along the Tom but the greatest part thereof with three churches was unfortunately destroyed last year by fire The inha∣bitants have been since compelled to erect their new buildings agreeable to a certain plan and uniformly corresponding with the whole but before the fire the  houses stood so irregular that the windings of the streets resembled a labyrinth The mud almost swal∣lowed up the wheels of our waggons for the streets will not be paved till the new buildings are finished In the burnt part of the town was the mart wherein the goods and property of many a citizen were devoured by the flames In the southern part of the lower town is a friary and a nunnery with their churches and the same part of the town has a church called the Annunciation and another dedicated to the VirginMary Here is also another townhouse a prison a comptoir of the mineoffice and a customhouse for the sale of brandies brought here from the distilleries on the Tobol and Iset The barges and vessels are moored below the town on account of the shallows near it and without the town the Koskolnicks or OldFaithful of which there is a great number among the inhabitants have their burialplaces and so have the Tartars  Here resides the commander of the batallion in gar∣rison and to him the commanders of two other forts are subordinate The court of waywodes is subordi∣nate to that of Tobolskoi and commands the most populous district of all Siberia except that of To∣bolskoi The inhabitants of Tomskoi live mostly by trade Here are no other manufactories than such as dye Russian hides and some few callicoprinters No where have I seen gluttony so prevalent as in this  place which added to other reigning evils forni∣cation and its attendant the venereal disease must be a dreadful bar to population especially as for want of regular surgeons the latter spreads itself excessively Was it not for this the place is happily situated for commerce which is carried on here with all parts of Siberia by the communication of two navigable rivers Bread is cheap meat not wanting and the Ob and Tom abound with fish and supply other towns with it It is only to be wished that many sober and industrious families might truly enjoy these blessings  Within these three years the Chinese trade has been settled on a proper footing and the merchants have brought here in the bales a little yellow housemoth  Blatta Asiatica  which has increased incredibly In all the woods between the Ob and Tom they have had an incredible number of squirrels It has already been shewn that they emigrate in summer from the southeast mountains into the district of Tomskoi Every ruined building of the town and the towns of the fortress were now infested with them and they were caught alive by boys who sold them very cheap  On the th of September in the afternoon I con∣tinued my journey and travelled miles in the even∣ing This country is pretty well colonized with Tar∣tars and troublesomely infested with black crows  which are so rapacious that they will in winter attack a yard of poultry in flocks of twenty at a time and tear the fowls in pieces I met here with a species of hedgesparrow or little nightingale with a fine yellow breast and a green tail  Motacilla Cyanurus  also a wonderfully small species of shrewmouse that did not weigh when full grown more than half a dram They are somewhat browner than the common shrewmice and have in proportion to their body a very thick full round tail They are therefore quite different from the  Sorex minutus  of Linnaeus which is also a Siberian animal and are the smallest of all quadru∣peds ever recorded in human knowledge This little animal shall be fuller described hereafter It is fond of the water like the black watershrew and the common shrewmouse both of which are very common here  The passage over the river Ki is by a ferry The river is stony and among the pebbles there are pieces of highred black and also black and yellow spotted jasper Colonizing this district will make the farmers comfortable and enable them to sell their corn at a good price which at present they are often compelled by indigence to part with for little or nothing They have not lately been able to get more than three or four copecs or one penny English for lb weight and here are public granaries where when bought at this price it is stored up near a navi∣gable  river to be conveyed to places where no corn is grown At the time when the polltax is to be paid a good horse may be bought for two or three rubles because the indigent farmer can find no buyers They have here a method of catching woodcocks which fre∣quent the birchwood simple yet effectual Laying a large plank across two branches of a birchtree they tie ears of corn at both ends and at the distance of a few inches from each end is fastened a circular springe with a horsehair snare tied on the plank The woodcocks sit on this plank but cannot reach the ears of corn unless they put their heads through the springe into the snare and if they try to come back they draw the snare with them and attempting to fly are entangled by the head The peasants call this snare  Nawori  I have already mentioned the Chinese moth  Blatta Asiatica  which the Tartars call  Tarakan  Here in Atschinokoe about miles from Tomskoi where I was on the th of September a village situated on the navigable river Tschulym the peasants houses are so full of them that in the daytime every dark corner chink and closet swarms and at night they cover all the walls nothing is free from these vermin for they will enter the smallest clefts No vessel or box be it ever so closely shut can remain in these rooms without being filled the next morning with thousands of big and little Tarakans They even  thirst after human blood and in one's sleep all the uncovered parts of the body are bleeding with this insect they will not touch any provisions but bread sugar and meat There is no eating or drinking in these rooms without having one insect dropping after another from the cieling into the dishes cups and plates Various means have been tried to destroy them without effect Shutting up a room and smok∣ing it with brimstone and offensive herbs have been tried but to no purpose The only way to get rid of them is to let the rooms freeze in the beginning of winter without fire This will apparently destroy them but by constant warmth they will soon appear again and in spring everything crawls with them as before  About miles further on where I was on the th of September I met with some Christian Tartars set∣tled on the brook Sulgun who in summertime live in wretched jurts or huts formed with high birchpoles set up in form of cones flatted at top and covered with strongly boiled birchbark sewed together and in winter time in hovels made with birchpoles laid across each other in form of a box The forepart of this box is left open and represents a hall or anti∣chamber the other half is shut up by a partition in which is a small door and on the outside covered thickly with turf to keep it warm In the middle of this inner room they make a Baskirian chimney of  sprays and loam with wooden airpipes and on the roof is left a little square hole to let in the light which they shut at night and in very cold weather  These Tartars have preserved most of their ancient ways of living and thinking for independent of the crucifix which they wear tied round their necks and suspend also in their jurts or tents they know but little of the Christian religion and as little of the Russian manners except an imitation of the female dress and some few necessary parts of agriculture Their girls go about dressed in the Tartarian fashion and men wear furs and whiskers They are in ge∣neral poor and have but little cattle owing as is said to the deep snows which fall in winter and will not allow the cattle to look out for food and to the great number of beasts of prey in this di∣strict  Mr  Gmelin  gives us a further account of this people whom he calls the Tschoulym Tartars He says  In summertime the men are dressed like Russian pea∣sants and in winter they wear long pelises made of deerskins The women wear trowsers and boots made of the large skins of eelpowts The other parts of their dress are like those of the Russian peasants except that they border their garments with  fur The girls plait their hair in tresses and all the female sex wear veils  Their table is dirty and badly accommodated Fish is their common food bread is scarce with them as a substitute for which they eat dried fish reduced to powder which looks like a meal Their greatest delicacy is parched grain fresh stalks of bear's foot and the  Acanthus  which they bruise all together and put under ground till it is sour In winter they seldom eat any thing but dried or smoked fish The poor who have neither milk nor flour live on various wild fruits and plants which they store up against winter indeed most Tartars do the same such as the roots of piony pimpernel  Sanguisorba  fumitory  Fumaria bulbosa  a sort of thistle  Carduus serratuloides  and serpentaria  Polygon bistorta  a root they call  Mikir Polygon viviparum  the root of sagittary  Sagittaria sagit∣tifol  and the root of  Nymphea  The membrane under the bark of the pinetree they give to children as a sweetmeat and they chew the root of  Calamus acorus  as the Indians do the betelroot All smoke tobacco and drink besides fishbroth the liquors used by the Russians an infusion of ryemeal soured by fermentation called  Quas  which is a pleasant liquor  Braga  a small beer strong beer and Russ brandy  The Tschoulyms wore formerly Pagans of the sect of the Schamans In the year a great number of them were converted to Christianity by the zeal of Archbishop Philotheus but they are now merely nominal Christians and adhere chiefly to idolatry in private They place however an unlimited credulity in the efficacy of the crucifix but retain the Pagan ceremonies of their ancestors as much as possible They abhor pork and eat horseflesh even that of diseased animals and often sacrifice to their idols in secret  The baptised Tartars of this tribe solemnize their marriages in churches but keep up to the old na∣tional ceremonies He who negotiates the mar∣riage takes a new Chinese pipe and tobacco goes to the young woman and having made his propo∣sals retires for some minutes leaving his pipe and tobacco on the table which if her friends take a whiff or two denotes that the proposal is accepted if not the pipe is not touched If he acquiesces he settles with her friends concerning the quantity of cloaths fur or cattle that is to be paid for the bride which in money amounts generally from five to fifty rubles After the marriageceremony the young couple sleep in a new hut built alongside of that belonging to the young woman's father and between these huts a fire is kept up all night The sports on this festival are dancing feasting c as  ATSCHULYM WEDDING  among other Tartars The bridegroom is obliged to wrestle with the male relations of his wife by the light of the beforementioned fire In these contests the husband must conquer and if he throws his antagonist without assistance his strength is very much commended The nuptial bed is a piece of felt spread on the ground on which the bride re∣fuses to lie down imploring the interference of some female friend This friend a married woman gets the better of her scruples gives her advice and is rewarded with a handsome suit of cloaths for her kindness See the Plate If the young lady cannot produce the next morning Mosaic proofs of her chastity the husband steals away ties a parcel of herbs about his head and as a punishment to his perfidious wife does not return till he has ob∣tained satisfaction from him who has robbed him of his honour This settled all is forgotten  When a woman is near her time of lyingin she calls in the assistance of her female neighbours but they have so little knowledge of midwifry that numbers of infants are destroyed in the birth and many others have navelruptures The priest names the child though the parents give it a fresh name afterwards The national names of the boys are  Ouliguéyak Kouguitsschak Mischagh Koulon  c that of the girls  Keguenek Patan Paremha  c  Children go by these names and not by those given at their baptism  Their regular manner of life frugal hard and exempt from cares keeps them in health but when they fall sick or wound themselves their sovereign remedy both internally and externally is the gall of a bear and some superstitious appli∣cations The smallpox occasionally makes great ravage among them They have an extreme dread of death and from a persuasion that the soul of a deceased person returns to seek its surviving rela∣tions and pursues them in union with the body on coming from a funeral they jump several times over a fire conceiving by this precaution they can prevent the deceased person from following them  The language of these Tartars is a mixture of the Tartarian and Mongol but has so many words pe∣culiar to itself that it might be taken for a different language They are neither cunning nor stupid but tractable attentive eager for instruction and wellskilled in what they learn When they have nothing to dread they are frank honest and com∣plaisant but when they have any thing to fear or apprehend they are sullen and deceitsul They are friendly and attentive to one another but lazy  in all kinds of business and slovenly and filthy in their way of living  They keep neither pigs nor poultry Fishing and hunting is their chief employ and the latter enables them to pay their tribute Every man capable of going a hunting is obliged to pay the state three martenskins annually or in lieu of them three elkskins three foxskins and ermineskins or any other furs equal in value to three martenskins The women are busied in spinning weav∣ing and sewing and as this takes up all their time they seldom stir out of their huts and look as if they were smokedried  In our way we saw several scattered tumuli which are seldom if ever to be met with but in the neigh∣bourhood of some lake or river or on the finest and most elevated spots of a field the bottoms of mountains and in flat vallies Several I saw that reminded me of the old giant's graves or beds of he∣roes found in the same form in some parts of Ger∣many particularly in MarkBrandenburg These consisted of little hills of earth round which were stuck in the ground some large flat pieces of rock and some had three little stone posts set near each other  The Tartars who now inhabit these districts acknowledge the nation from whom they derive their origin as their ancestors It is an old story among them that formerly there were two brothers perhaps only nationally so one of whom with his people dug a great deal of gold and silver out of the mountains and the other was rich in cattle and people that the latter had often so deprived the former of his trea∣sures and molested him that he sought refuge among the princes of China who allotted him and his peo∣ple a tract of country towards the east and from these last they sprang In the graves which differing in external appearance are probably of one and the same nation no other than copper tools and arms are found and some few gold and silver ornaments generally no other gold than what is beaten out into thin leaves  During my stay at Krasnojarskaja among the old copper dug out of such graves and offered me by the peasants I found copper points of lances a kind of light battleaxe daggers elegantly wrought blades of knives whetstones points of copper and bonearrows copper scythes similar to those now used in Siberia several flat cast figures of elks and reindeer stags chamois and wild sheep In these graves are sometimes also found wooden frames in which the dead bodies have been laid with the figure of a chamois fastened on the fore post of such a frame and also some  little white stones in form of snails called in Latin  Cyprea nodosa  I shall perhaps give a further ac∣count of the nature of these tumuli  In this neighbourhood I passed a farm belonging to a Tartar of Tomskoi and also a countryresidence belonging to the same person elegantly built of larches with a terrace on the top Near this house are several houses built in the Russian manner be∣longing to some of his relations Here will also be built a church for the converted Tartars hitherto be∣longing to the district of Scheresch which this patriotic Tartar is taking all imaginable pains to reduce from their wild savage state to agriculture and more so∣cial life  In ferrying my waggons in the morning early over the river Tschoulym on the th of September the boat which carried my baggage was unfortunately overset in the middle but as the water was not more than seven feet deep it was with some difficulty drawn out again all its contents however were so wet that I was obliged to stop till noon to dry them The next day I halted among another tribe of Tartars called  Katchinzi  whose jurts or huts were erected at the bottom of the high mountain Tarbig where the white river Ujus streams and spreads itself along a fine sandy vale in which are several bitter lakes and saltspots which Mr  Gmelin  visited and from which  the district of Krasnojarskaja is supplied with salt Having spent the night here on the th I had an opportunity of observing and enquiring into the way of living of these wealthy Tartars with whom most others living on the upper Jenisei agree in many points and seem to have a common origin  These Tartars who distinguish themselves from the rest by the name of Katchinzi do not consist of more than one hundred men who keep possession of the fine pasturegrounds between the Yjus and Abakan on the western side of the Jenisei To judge of them by their language they are true Tartars but they are bastards in their features dress and manners of which they have adopted many of the Mongalian because probably they were under the yoke of the Kalmucks and had thus a communication as neigh∣bours with the Mongols otherwise they have many Mongalian words in their language which a Tartar of Casan does not understand and to whom their ex∣pression and pronunciation appear strange The men shave their heads like the Kalmucks and leave only a halfcircular whisker on the upper lip turned up and a tust on the under lip or chin Most of them especially the younger ones make a tail of their black hair on the hinder part of their heads yet they do not shave or cut off the rest but let it hang about five or six inches long about the head  In winter they usually wear no shirt but a long skin furred within on their bare bodies with narrow sleeves Most of these furs are deerskins which the women tan with the liver and brains of the same ani∣mal for hours then make them soft over their knees by rubbing them with a piece of wood parti∣cularly adapted for this purpose The richer and more noble among them wear sheep or lambs furs and at feasts and public solemnities upper garments of cloth and silken underones But the common people besides their furs and boots wear nothing but a pair of white coarse linen drawers or trowsers which are made by their wives from the hemp∣nettle growing in their vallies and which they call  Kender  The dress of the women differs little from the com∣mon dress of the Kalmucks and consists in two tresses of hair hanging down their shoulders and a round cap with a broad fur border a knot of fringes on the top and two pieces of silk hanging down from be∣hind Girls till the day of their nuptials wear a little round cap flatted behind without any fur border but with a red fringe tassel on the top They braid their hair into nine tresses three of which hang down the neck behind and three on each side the head The womens garments are elegantly cut out especially their furs Some married women wear a breastplate or a collar set with beads Children run mostly naked  about the jurts or yourts I call them sometimes yourts because as I have observed before the jod  J  in Tartary is sounded like our  Y  The jurts or tents in which they live in win∣ter are spacious covered with felts and similar to those of the Kalmucks and Kirgese All live the rich not excepted in a manner uncommonly filthy and brutish never washing any vessels but as soon as they are emptied put them away and when they want them again use them in the same state Those who call themselves troublesomely clean will only rub them a little with their dirty hands Their housholdfurniture consists of iron kettles wooden cups and birchbark troughs They make milkbrandy as do the Kalmucks and during summer and autumn whilst their brandy lasts are seldom sober They are all fond of smoking tobacco women as well as men and they will smoke times out of the same Chinese pipe Their greatest dainty and most common food next to meat is barley or ryegroats baked brown in a pan with flour over which melted butter is poured This dish they call  Kasch  and eat of it at any time of the day when they are hungry Besides this they boil and eat the stalks of cowparsnep  Sphondylium  and all sorts of wild roots as pionyroots reedmace red lily roots  Lilium pomponium  and the dog'stooth  Erythronium  which they call  Bess  Of all the Tartarian tribes I have yet seen this is the nastiest the most inhospitable and the most treach∣erous They do not spare even one another are very illbehaved when drunk and often attack the Cossacks sent by order of the state to restore peace and harmony They are divided into ulusses or which each has a head whom they call  Knaszi  or little princes They pay their tribute or taxes in furs or a competent sum of money and when they pay this tax are usually heated with strong liquor and seldom return without a quarrel and blood∣shed  Their wealth consists in cattle which feed the whole winter in the fine mountainous step they inhabit and retreat in summer to refreshing and delightful vales of course they must thrive The mountainair how∣ever prevents their growing large Their horses are excellent hunters lightcoloured and slender and carry their slit noses in the wind for they always slit the nostrils of their horses They water them without the least reserve though in the most violent heat except in springtime when they deem it hurtful but no overheated horse will they suffer to eat for the first two hours Their oxen and cows are speckled lively and strong but small in size Their sheep are a me∣dium between Kalmuck and Russian their noses are more bent and their ears more hanging have the same kind of wool and a fat tail some have horns  some not and many rams have four and six horns each Their general colour is white with black or speckled heads and breasts Sheep quite white or quite black are rarely seen  I could learn but little of the religious ceremonies of this people They are true and very rank hea∣thens They pray to their good god turning their faces to the east dreading more a bad Being than a good one and offer it sacrifices that it may not hurt them To this evil Being they offer a horse at a spring festival which must be of a particular colour It is led to the altar and incensed with the smoke of the herb  Irwen  which is a species of fragrant wormwood washed and sprinkled with milk which during their prayers they scatter in the air and throw into the sacrificial fire and after having tied a red and white rag on the forepart of the mane and on the tail they turn it loose among the herd These sacred horses are called Isik and the ceremony abovemen∣tioned is repeated annually during which a sorcerer or Kamno acts the principal part The same bad Being as far as I could understand is represented by a houseidol which they call  Tous  and which we find on the eastern side of every tent stuck on a stick split like a fork or tied on upon a band across two coarsely carved figures having the resemblance of two birds each bearing a woodcock's feather so that the whole has the appearance of a twobodied bird with  extended wings Between these two little carved figures hangs a piece of fox or ermineskin and a long tail of split sinews interwoven with horsehair  In the yourts or tents of the rich I remarked that there was between these two pieces of wood a wooden hoop or circle with a carved beater tied on it pro∣bably a representation of the magic drum of the Kam∣no who made and consecrated the idols Besides the forked stick are two other sticks placed between the ropes that hold the tent together one carrying a red and the other a white rag commonly accompanied by a blue one These three colours seem to be sacred among the Tartars and the same are chosen by their sorcerers or Kamnos for magic robes and ornaments These sticks and rags are sometimes on one side the idol and sometimes on the other Many tents espe∣cially those of the poor have only in the forked stick the fur of a fox's tail and behind the end of a sheep's tail with its wool On both sides these orna∣ments hang little rags or blue cloth and down the band hangs a thick cord made of brown and white sheep's wool twisted Besides this there are sticks with white and red rags Some hang up only an ermine skin in a stick these I found on the east and west sides of the tents whereas the sticks with the rags were only on the eastern side They do not suffer any one to touch these sacred things and often pray  about them when they are in want of any thing At the springfeast this idol is also incensed over the fire with the herb Iwen therefore looks much singed In many tents where I have seen the idol I have seen also this herb fixed up with it  Their sorcerers or magic priests and priestesses make use of small drums" says  Gmelin  "in their incantations as do the Laplanders and are distin∣guished in dress by a quantity of mishapen idols rudely cast in iron which are fastened on their garments together with the claws of birds and strips of cloth and furs Their caps are generally or∣namented with a border of lynxskin and a bunch of owls feathers  They have as many wives as they can maintain or purchase but seldom has one man more than four The ceremony of asking in marriage is like that of the Tschoulyms excepting only that with the pipe of tobacco is left a cup of brandy If the pipe is smoked and the brandy drunk the proposal is accepted Six months after this the bridegroom comes and courts the young woman in the same way the price is then agreed for which is from five to head of cattle but if the suitor be poor he will work for the fatherinlaw for three four or five years in order to obtain his daughter Dur∣ing this time if any richer or handsomer gallant  applies for the girl he carries her off seemingly against her inclination and thus shortens forma∣lities The injured lover who perhaps has waited a year or two accompanied by her friends pursues the fugitive but as the runawaycouple seldom fails to improve that time which the other loses in pre∣paring for the pursuit and as the girl gives the preference to the pretended ravisher all the labour∣ing lover can obtain is a competent recompence for his past services Should the betrothed damsel die before the performance of the marriagecontract the price paid is withheld for the purchase of her sister and if she has no sister the suiter loses his money or his labour If the young man dies before the wedding the girl is the property of his father who takes her home and leads her to his ha∣ram  When all preparations for the wedding are made and the bridegroom arrives with his friends to fetch the bride his parents and relations are introduced to the bride's father's tent who sits at the upper end with the mother and all the rest sit round in a circle or stand out before the tent The bride then falls down before her parents bidding them farewell with tears and takes her leave of her sisters and relations The cries and lamentations of all the women present now become general and the bridegroom leads the bride away by the hand to another tent prepared for  them The whole day then and many following ones are spent in feasting and diversions Sometimes a bride shall be secretly carried off by a rival in which case the  argumentum baculinum  takes place and the law of the fist decides between the parties Should the bride be unfaithful to her lover or commit adultery there are various proceedings which end in satisfaction being made to the lover or the husband  After the marriage a fatherinlaw is not per∣mitted to see a daughterinlaw nor she to look on him and if they meet by chance she falls flat on her face that she may conceal it A husband dis∣satisfied with his wife may return her to her friends without any formal process though it be two or three years after marriage but then he is obliged to maintain the children and loses the money he paid for his wife  There is no disease peculiar to this people ex∣cept that a great number of the girls in the time of their menses are in a state of furor or phrensy from which they do not return for many days The smallpox whenever it appears makes great ra∣vages among them In cases of sickness they have recourse to the magic priest who performs sacrifices for their cure even in the venereal disease which is no uncommon complaint  They bury their dead without coffins and in their usual dress put some few necessary utensils into the grave and cover the corpse with boards before they shovel in the earth that the earth may not touch it On the gravehill they place a drinkingcup and leave it there At the expiration of a year from the day of interment the relations of the deceased visit the grave first lament the loss of the deceased and finish with drinking the strong liquors they bring with them out of that cup they left and each drinks out of it so often that they generally return very merry from this mournful visit  For all their diversions they have but one musical instrument called  Jailtaga  It is a box of sir about four feet long and three inches broad the upper part open over which six wire strings are stretched It is played on with both hands and produces treble and base it is used with the left hand and little with the right To tune this instrument they place a bridge under each string and shist it till it produces the tone they wish Their maladies are like those of the Kalmucks and so are their dances  On the th of September I left these people passed over a mountainous district and got before a great saltlake  Bylykul  miles in circumference There I met with a number of rare plants and among these one that has not yet been described by botanists It is  a species of madwort  Alyssum  which I shall give a description of when I meet with it more in perfection than at present Not far from the Bylykul we changed horses and continued our road till we came to the mine Itkulskoi where we spent the night The works here are suspended but they have dug to the depth of fathoms and found a fine lazuli ore which contains in pounds of raw done lb of copper nine drams of silver and drams and a half of gold A new mine is opened close by and the peasants work here for their headtax The Jenisei here is fathoms wide we crossed it passing many islands in the middle where grew a great quantity of wild hops and on the other side found ourselves on the d of October in the fortress Abakanskoi Ostrog  This is a wretched decayed place has a wooden church and but few buildings but a governor resides here who has the command of all the district round it The climate is however mild and an inhabitant of Little Russia here settled has begun to cultivate to∣bacco and intends to plant fruittrees and breed bees About this place there are abundance of rare little birds the snowbird the crossbill the waterwagtail the titmouse and woodpecker which con∣tinue here the whole winter The inhabitants told me that two years since a number of white spotted bears had been seen here who seemed to have travelled from far as they were quite lean and weak and so hungry that they ran into some of the neighbouring villages where many had been killed  During my stay here I saw two white sparrows but none of my hunters could kill any I would wil∣lingly have spent my winter here but there being no comfortable apartment to be had was obliged to look out for proper accommodations in Krasnojarskaja The winter was fast approaching and being afraid of the river's freezing I thought proper to set out on the th of October it being necessary to cross the Jenisei to go to Krasnojarskaja  On the th being near the river we saw two floats coming down from the ironmanufactory established a little higher up and capable of receiving all our wag∣gons I had thus an opportunity of going to Krasno∣jarskaja by water which was at the distance of miles This manufactory was erected years ago by a merchant whose son is now the proprietor It be∣longs to the district of the supreme mineoffice at Catherineburg though at the distance from it of miles Its situation is delightful and its millhead fathoms long The works here consist of five smelting furnaces two blasts with double receiv∣ers and several forges and hammerworks  All things being ready for our departure we set off on the floats October the th at noon a third part of this passage at highwater is often made in one day but we were unfortunately delayed by being stranded on a sandbank by the imprudence of the wa∣termen  and could not get off With hard labour however we got clear in the space of three hours and soon after moored along side of the village Of∣scharskaja where I took up my night's lodging In the banks of the river opposite this place they collect a great deal of that which is called stonebutter It is gathered here every year from among the clefts of the black allum slate of which this bank consists and is sold at Krasnojarskaja at or copecs per pud The common people use it as a medicine in dysen∣teries also against hemorrhages of lyingin women and in venereal disorders and likewise as an emetic for children In case of necessity they use also the stonevitriol instead of vitriol to dye leather and blacksmiths use it to make steel  Next morning the th we unmoored betimes and continued our passage down the Jenisei Towards night we reached the mouth of the river Mana and the village Osjanskaja and slept there This village is a rare example of the propagation of mankind in the wild desarts of Siberia The whole village a few houses excepted is inhabited by people originating from one stock Here are wealthy families and almost as many others of the same origin who are settled in the villages along the Jenisei The father of this numerous posterity one Juschkof came two centuries ago into this district from Russia and it was at that time inhabited and is molested still by  the Kirgese He had seven sons one of whom was killed by the Kirgese the rest settled and increased his progeny and became fathers of families  Their indefatigable industry in hunting seems to be hereditary to the whole posterity for they are all peo∣ple of property With respect to hunting the wild uninhabited mountains upwards the river Mana affords them an excellent opportunity not to mention the smaller animals as weasels squirrels c they catch fables lynxes and bears in abundance The musk is also very abundant there They catch it in autumn and in the beginning of winter with snares and traps in which the animal shortly dies The muskbag which is by far less fragrant than the Chinese is sold at from to copecs and is used like their deer furs as it surpasses every fur by its softness The river Mana supplies them likewise plentifully with fish and besides this they apply themselves to agriculture and have some extensive farms upon the river It is but miles from the village we last slept at to Krasnojarskaja we reached that town on the th of October in good time and here I took up my winterresidence  With this I shall end the second part of my account and shall give the reader the observations I made in the course of this year in the beginning of the third part  END OF PART II  TRAVELS THROUGH Siberia and Tartary PROVINCES OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE  BY S PALLAS M D PROFESSOR OF NATURAL HISTORY c  PART III  NOT wishing to tire our readers by following our Author in all his minute and particular accounts and descriptions of every wood lake and mountain and every little village and brook he passed nor in measuring every inch he travelled as  he  has done we have contented ourselves with giv∣ing the great outline of the road he journeyed and circumstantially relating from his pen every thing  even in natural history worth remarking and what we could suppose any class of our readers might wish to be acquainted with We have however passed over the nature of the roads and the bad accommodations he met with Suffice it to say that being equipped at governmentexpence with such passports and necessaries as a traveller in such a wild and dreary country might stand in need of such as credit tents provisions forage cloaths me∣dicines mathematical instruments tools men versed in various sciences draftsmen huntsmen interpre∣ters guides escorts servants waggons c he traced every navigable river from its mouth to its source travelled all the boundaries of the empire from fort to fort and at these places got a change of horses occasional escorts and fresh equipment In some places he traversed mountains in others forced through woods almost impervious in others floundered over marshes and in others again forded rivers or crossed them in ferries or on rafts sometimes encamping in the desarts and often sleeping in the open air  In some parts of Tartary the roads are tolerably passable the customary highways are known from place to place by the annual passing of caravans there he found occasionally wayhouses with relays of horses and some accommodations Where there were no such houses unless he was in the vicinage or  some fortress where the commandingofficer accom∣modated him with regimental horses and an es∣cort of the troops he was under a necessity of en∣camping on the road and refreshing the same horses by food and rest A number of difficulties he encountered as we  have  seen and  shall  see but an inquisitive mind which is panting after know∣ledge fears no danger surmounts every obstacle in its way and pursues its end with unremitting ardour  Krasnojarskaja Oct  After my arrival here the weather was uncommonly mild and delightful as it usually happens in this season throughout the south∣ern district of Siberia and almost in all eastern moun∣tainous countries At the latter end of the month however winter set in the whole district was exposed to storms between N W and S W and the rivers drove a great deal of ice It rained and snowed till the th of November when a frost succeeded and shut up the river Jenisei entirely The rapidity of this river ge∣nerally keeps it open till the middle of November and the ice dissolves again in April  In the nights of the th and th of December the cold was severely felt the thermometer mounted ° on the th in the morning to ° on the th ° on the th ° and on the twelfth ° It then snowed but with the beginning of  the year the cold became so intense that on the th of January the thermometer pointed at ° on the th ° the th ° and on the th ° A violent storm that blew from the northwest con∣cluded this severe weather on the th which brought on continual western showers that augmented the snow and the winter continued moderate The sun began to shine warm in the latter half of February and the snow thawed away from most summits of the neighbour∣ing mountains  The town or city has changed but little in the last thirty years It is almost the same as it was when  Gmelin  was here The stonecathedral is not yet finished the inhabitants are as few and it has re∣ceived no increase of buildings Perhaps the indo∣lence and debauchery of the common citizens nursed by the low price of corn and the great plenty of pro∣visions may be the cause of the bad progress of this place In every other respect Krasnojarsk is most advantageously situated for commerce It is at pre∣sent a place through which all Russian merchants pass to trade with the Chinese and it is here and at Tomskoi that passengers eagerly buy up common sables and other furs wanted by the Chinese From the months of November till February we see many thousand hired sledges pass in caravans through this town which do not stop at all because the merchant to whom the caravan belongs rides be∣fore  and purchases the furs he wants chiefly with ready money of course Russia goods are much dearer here than in Irkuzkaja Chinese goods are also at a more than reasonable price in the shops here be∣cause the sale of them is too inconsiderable and there are but two or three merchants capable of dealing in such goods They therefore put such a price on them as they think proper and certainly not to their disadvantage  The productions of this district are in general cheaper than the productions of any other part of the Russian empire though no province complains of higher prices I shall scarcely be believed when I de∣clare that on my arrival in Krasnojarsk a pud or lb of ryeflour would sell for no more than from ½ to copecs each copec a halfpenny English wheat∣flour from ½ to copecs per pud beef from to copecs a cow for one ruble s d English good horses for three rubles and sometimes for two a sheep from to copecs and hogs at the same price But the price of corn seems to have risen a great deal owing to the great quantities transported on the rivers Tschoulym and Ob to the distant manu∣factories mines and fortresses to a brandydistillery at no great distance and to an Imperial magazine and yet the price of rye has not risen more than five or six copecs per pud  Hence may be seen the great fertility and abund∣ance of this district for though within the town there is great scarcity of buyers as most of the inha∣bitants grow their own corn and breed their own cat∣tle yet the great exportation of corn in the barren districts of the regency of Irkuzkaja and more to the north about the Jenisei one would imagine would be sufficient to raise the prices higher if the fertility of the country was not so extraordinary There has never been an instance of a failure in the crops and it is reckoned but a moderate harvest when summerrye produces tenfold the seed the winter crops eightfold barley twelvefold In the worst years wheat pro∣duces sixfold and oats seldom less than twentyfold Common buckwheat is but little sown here and where it is sowed it must be done in some wornout piece of ground or the extraordinary richness of the soil would spoil the crop In the worst ground it will bear from twelve to fifteenfold This very rich soil generally in the heights and vallies is every where black and light and forbids the use of all dressing A fallow of one year will improve the lands for ten or fifteen years and sometimes for a longer time and should the fertility of this soil decrease the husband∣man has sufficient land in the steps that will answer every purpose The new fields are commonly prepared after the summerseed is over They burn it up first in the beginning of June plough it once more at the end  of the month and it is then fit to receive the seed of the wintercrop in August or they will sow it with wheat the ensuing spring in which case such new land is to be ploughed a third time for there is no winter wheat throughout Siberia though it is so com∣mon and useful in the districts of Casan and on the Kama After the first crop such a field is left during the next winter unploughed In the fourth summer they lay it up after ploughing it twice and such lay∣lands are sown in the autumn or the following spring for most grounds bear two years out of three and high dry and sandy spots at least every other year and are fit for all sorts of corn hemp and pease  I have been more circumstantial here than I should have been in order to give an account of the mode of agriculture in the eastern parts of Siberia and to shew how happy the countryman must be in these foreign districts and how much they deserve to be better peopled  The jurisdiction of the regency of this town spreads in length and breadth over miles of ground and yet is not inhabited by more than men among whom are Tartars who live merely by hunting and breeding of cattle yet this district surpasses the more eastern countries of Siberia in population But he who considers that Siberia has not but within these  two centuries been much more peopled than NorthAmerica and was then as unknown a wilderness as that must be surprised at the present state of the country and the great number of Russian inhabitants who far surpass the natives in skill and industry The discovery and rapid conquest of so vast a territory unknown before extending to the eastern ocean must be an everlasting monument of celebrity to the genius intrepidity and perseverance of the Russian nation and its population now carrying on to the utmost may be looked upon as a masterpiece in policy  The Siberians pay but little attention to culinary herbs though they thrive well in Krasnojarsk and all the southern districts of Siberia The early white frosts in autumn do less damage even to the most ten∣der plants than the later frosts in May of course gourds and girkins come to perfection in the open fields when melons and watermelons will scarce thrive in gardens They have begun to cultivate tobacco and with great success This plant finds many pur∣chasers among the Pagan nations but they do not know the proper time when the leaves are to be taken off or how to prepare them The tobacco therefore of Krasnojarsk on account of its greenness goes by a different name from other tobacco and the best price it will fetch is about copecs per pud whilst the common leaves grown in and about Udinskaja  will fetch copecs The inhabitants of this place carry on a good trade in wild hops which grow plen∣tifully in the islands of the Jenisei and bring here a number of buyers in autumn They sell at the rate of from copecs to one ruble per pud They are chiefly carried to Jeniseikaja Irkuzkaja and those districts upon the Tunguska where there are no hops What they do not sell they keep for their own brewing and hereby indulge their debauchery  Among the usual wild growths of the mountains of Krasnojarskaja the rhapontic or rhubarb deserves our notice When the medical college at Petersburgh is in want of any the people here engage to procure a certain quantity and carry it to the townhouse at a certain price To do this they employ a number of mountaineers to dig the root in autumn in places be∣yond the Abakan The best is brought from Udins∣kaja and is dug in the mountains about the rivers Uda and Birjussa Commonly they are roots of the rhubarb  Rheum undulatum  and some other such like species which seems to be different from what bota∣nists call  Rhaponticum  I am at a loss to know whe∣ther the moistness of the soil in which the Siberian rhapontic grows about the mountainbrooks must be ascribed to the climate especially the wetness of the last summer when all the old rhaponticplants were rotten in the principal knots of their roots which are often very large The innermost parts of the thick  root is always found there changed quite to the peel into a yellowbrown marrowlike matter bitter and astringent to the taste it is only in the cylindrical con∣tinuations of the roots that there is any good medicinal virtue and therefore the Siberian rhapontic is vul∣garly called on account of its form  Tscherenkowoi Re∣wenn  During the winter they sent from Kras∣nojarsk to Tobolskoi puds from whence it was conveyed to Petersburgh for the use of the college But these roots might have been gotten better and stronger if the rhapontic diggers had more particular directions how to prepare it for as soon as these people have brought the roots home they peel cut them in pieces and dry them in a gentle warmth and hereby the root loses its most efficacious moistness dries up and becomes quite spongy so as to be very unlike the genuine rhubarb either in appearance or strength On the contrary I took several rhapontic roots which I received quite untouched some from Udinskaja and some from the Sajanian mountains which I hung up in the cieling of a warm room and when sufficiently dried I shaved off the medicinal parts of the root quite clean and found them compact and highcoloured like the best Chinese rhubarb and it was very little inferior to that in strength and far su∣perior in taste and efficacy to the rhapontic pre∣pared in the common way Were it possible to find districts in the Siberian mountains where the prin∣cipal  stem of the rhapontic is not rotten I doubt not but all its roots if prepared in my way would be equal at least very little inferior in size beau∣ty solidity and strength to the Chinese rhu∣barb  Krasnojarskaja like most parts of Siberia abounds in all sorts of wood and the finest timber may be felled with very little trouble from the deep moun∣tains about the Jenisei and floated down to this town Except the plane the elm and the lindentree which are not to be found in the eastern part of Siberia all common species of trees are to be met with in great abundance There is also great quantities of cedars in the neighbourhood of the river Mana About Abakan∣skaja grows on the Jenisei abundance of fragrant poplars whose resinous buds afford a delicious winterrepast to woodcocks and gives their entrails a fine balsamic perfume There is also a great deal of under∣wood of various denominations particularly the haw∣thorn and cotonaster  Krasnojarsk is plentifully supplied in winter with game and all sorts of furs A liberty of hunting such animals properly speaking is only granted to the Siberians who pay a tax for such leave and who make hunting their principal occupation yet the Rus∣sian peasant commonly devotes his indolent winter to the chace They set traps and snares for all species of  game and catch a great number of ermines and other animals These people will purchase from the ma∣gistrates a permission to hunt and are at liberty to hunt with such a licence but if they hunt without obtaining this run the risk of being caught by the Tartars and chastised upon the spot or put into the hands of justice which always rewards the appre∣hender  Sables are a common animal in the district of Kras∣nojarskai and there are two species some longhaired and greyish and some shorthaired and black Those caught about this place are of inferior value Wolves are much extirpated here as they are in most parts of Siberia Foxes however are very abundant in the open districts and they bring from the northern parts black and blackgrey ones of great value Beavers and otters are also abundantly met with and the latter are often sold at seven rubles each and ex∣ported to the frontiers of China Lynxes are not ge∣neral and reach to the same price their particoloured forepaws are sold separately Hyenas are more abundant and a black one will sell for four rubles There are still a greater number of badgers but as their skins are of little value they are seldom killed but when they are bad neighbours or when their fat is wanted Ermines are caught in large quantities Whilst they were saleable in the Chinese trade a skin would sell for copecs but there is no buyer now  that will give a fifth of that price The yellow weasels may be plentifully caught in the woody districts and with little trouble Those which by accident fall into the traps or snares are purchased by merchantpas∣sengers at five or six copecs each and are a favourite object of sale to the Chinese who pay a very good price for them of course they are sold much dearer at Irkuzkaja and are not carried into Russia at all The polecat is not bought here at any price though its skin is much finer in Siberia and of a much whiter and more elegant colour than in Russia  Larger game as elks stags deer and musks are in great abundance especially on the other side of the Jenisei The Tartars pay a good part of their taxes in elk and large stagskins which the treasury takes for the use of the cavalry at and copecs each According however to a new regulation the headtax is no longer paid per head but by whole tribes so that all the Pagan families in the district of Krasnojarsk pay together sables yet the tax goes by the denomination of that species of fur not∣withstanding though the tribute is paid in other furs or in money rating a sable at one ruble  Deers are so common here that the whole animal slesh and fur will scarce sell for copecs hence their skins are mostly used and sold for furs to travel in and the price for one is in copecs Musks I  observed were here caught in great numbers The males are sold on account of their bags  Struika  from to copecs each whereas the female fur and slesh will scarce fetch copecs They brought me as a great curiosity a female musk quite white and afterwards they sent me the white fur of a male  Fish is not so abundant in this province as in some other parts The Katscha being shallow like many other Siberian rivers becomes stinking in win∣tertime under the ice and has therefore no fish The Jenisei has but few branches and on account of its rocky bottom and the rapidity of its stream is very little fit for fishing Fishes of passage very seldom come into it from the north or glacial sea It has but one or two species of Russian salmon and very few sturgeons and husos are found in it which are very delicious They are however not easily taken as they select such deep spots in winter as cannot be got at  The whole district of Krasnojarsk whose court of Waywods is subordinate to the regency of the province of Jenisei and whose governor is subject to the mi∣litaryoffice at Tomskoi contains at present Russian peasants colonists exiled persons placed among the colonists citizens and trades∣men  Posatsky  and  Zechowye  and Tartars of  different tribes who pay tribute and are divided into six districts are again subdivided into certain classes and who pay in the whole annually rubles  In January Mr Surjef arrived at my lodgings in Krasnojarsk from a tour he had made in the course of the last summer along the river Ob to the frozen ocean I will give my readers an extract of his observations and papers from the time of his de∣parture  He left Tscheljabynskaja on the th of February his road as far as Tobolskoi produced no∣thing remarkable In the latter place he was most kindly received by his excellency Governor Tschit∣scherin who gave him every necessary passport for the district of Beresowa to which place he set forward on a sledge on the th of March His road thither was principally all along the banks of the Irtisch which are scattered with Tartarian Russian and far∣ther north with Eastjaikian villages through which he passed The Tartarian towns reach only as far as Demjanskoi jam at the distance of about miles from Tobolskoi but the Eastjaikian villages extend beyond Demjanskoi and occur frequently In some villages the Eastjaiks live with the Russians and in general as far as Beresowa are apparently christians having been baptised All the way as far as Demjan∣skoi  jam the country is in a great measure under cultivation by the Russians and Tartars From this place northwards they saw nothing but barley and oats and very little summer corn as it does not thrive owing to the cold and moistness of the soil they sow hemp and flax among it The colewort gets no heads here and grows loose in leaves Leeks radishes tur∣neps and horseradish if the weather is tolerable thrive pretty well  Further down the river into the steps the country is not habitable at all being wholly wood and deep mires impervious at all seasons The wood chiefly consists of underwood and badly grown trees The most common trees are willows dwarfcherries alders white cornels asps poplars birches pines and firs which are seldom of a fine growth The linden is not seen further north than miles from Tobolskoi Of small bushes and shrubs the country produces red and black currants the  uva ursi  and several others On both sides the river are lakes which have a communication with the river where the water is high  Samarofskoi jam is the most considerable place be∣tween Tobolskoi and Beresowa and is distant from the former town miles by water and situated on the right of the Irtisch in a low border just underneath a higher and more mountainous country only miles beyond the communication of the Irtisch with the Ob  The place was colonized in with several families from Demjanskoi and the northern districts of the regency of Casan and consists of dwellings and a church The inhabitants have no agriculture and further north up the Ob to the Surgut and Narym no corn is sown at all but is brought by the Irtisch from Tobolskoi  In Samarofskoi horses do not thrive well they die in great numbers for want of provision Last year the water was so high that it covered all the meadows with slime just before they were to be cut and spoiled them This district however is blessed with an abundance of fish and waterfowl on which the Russian inhabitants and Eastjaiks have their chief subsist∣ence The Chinese moths are found in this place but no farther north  Beresowa called by the Eastjaiks Sumytwasch by the Samojedes Chucharn lies on the river Joswa at miles from its mouth into the next branch of the Ob It is irregularly built and has not above houses mostly inhabited by Cossacks but there are also two churches and a cathedral or motherchurch all built of stone Without the town is a chapel dedicated to St Alexander Newskoi of whom they tell a number of miraculous stories particularly one of a cedartree's growing in the centre of the chapel whilst they were building it The inhabitants  are substantial peaceable and hospitable people who have enriched themselves by fishing hunting breeding of reindeer and trading with the pagan and Russian merchants who visit them They pay little attention to the unwholesomeness of their situation and by in∣temperate drinking bring on a great many diseases and often sudden death  Beresowa supplies Tobolskoi and other towns situ∣ated on the river Ob with frozen fish in winter and dried fish in summer From this place are brought half the blue and white icefoxes dressed and undressed elk and reindeer skins black and white bearskins red foxes wolves bad sables a great number of bea∣vers and otters and abundance of other furs For agriculture the country is unfit like all others north of this The environs of the town are low and marshy woods of birch fir and cedar the trees of which are not very tall Of gardenstuff some thrives very well The fishery is astonishingly rich and from spring to autumn they have an inexpressible quantity of large waterfowls as swans geese ducks c The most wealthy of the inhabitants keep in the northern districts large herds of reindeer under the care of shepherds for this is the only domestic animal that will thrive well in the north Oxen and horses cannot live there Few of the inhabitants keep either sheep swine or chickens Those who keep the latter are obliged to shut them up lest they should be torn by  the dogs for as dogs are employed in wintertime to draw little travelling sledges to carry wood and other services a great number of them are kept and they are the more useful as they require little attend∣ance and will pick up their living on the remains of fish and fowl that is every where scattered and par∣ticularly as they will feed on the waterrat of which there are many in the Ob But in another respect these animals are a nuisance as they make an intole∣rable howling every morning throughout the whole town like the crowing of cocks as soon as one begins all the dogs of the town are sure to follow  Beresowa lies about five degrees more to the north than Tobolskoi according to the oblique direction of the rivers the distance from it by water is miles by land in the winterroad only miles Not∣withstanding the summer is short it is sometimes very hot and the weather in winter often so soft and mild that the snow melts upon the roads In the warm weather continued all August and September but the frost followed so suddenly that the rivers were frozen in the middle of October The Ob usually freezes about that time and is not open before the end of May  Birds of passage arrive much sooner than the end of May and continue in the lakes till they find in the  rivers and in the northermost wilds proper places to make their nests Should there be still on their ar∣rival any winter weather in the district of Beresowa they make up the river into the more southern and watry districts upon the Irtisch and as soon as the weather becomes milder draw down in crowds north∣wards to people their cold and native home Mr Surjef spent the spring at Beresowa collecting the rarest species of waterfowl and their number is astonishing The most curious birds he brought me were as follow Of the goose kind  Anser pul∣chri collis  of ducks  Anas fusca nigra marila hy∣emalis  and  acuta  which were caught in great num∣bers the diver  Colymbus arcticus et immer  Of gulls  Larus minutus  of landbirds the falcon  Falco bar∣barus  which builds its nest in the northermost moun∣tains in summer and the woodpecker  Picus tridactylus  Every species of wild duck small and large geese common plovers and gulls snipes and other such birds increase the crowd and their number is above expression  When Mr Surjef had completed his collection of waterfowls he proceeded on his journey to the seacoast In summer there is no way to ObdorskoiGorodok the most northern place of note but by water he therefore set out the th of June with a huntsman an interpreter and six cossacks in a large barge The river had now so much overflown all the  low lands and islands that it looked like a vast sea here and there a willowtree shewing its top above water He arrived at ObdorskoiGorodok on the th a distance by water of miles This place is called by the Eastjaicks  Pulnowatwasch  and by the Samojedes  Sola Chern  It is situated near the th degree of northlatitude and is erected on a moun∣tain on the border of the little river Polni which at four miles from thence empties itself on the right into the Ob ObdorskoiGorodok consists only of five houses but a number of magazines and storehouses and has at a distance the appearance of a very extensive village It has a church dedicated to St Basil The Russian inhabitants remain there during the winter and leave it in summer but many East∣jaiks repair there in winter and live in demisubter∣ranean dwellings Here resides an inspector or Ope∣kun placed over the neighbouring Eastjaiks and Sa∣mojedes he is a Cossack born and commands an Ataman and Cossacks  The district on both sides the Ob is mountainous and the mountains which consist chiefly of a chertz∣like slate are very bare Near Obdorskaja there are no other trees than some few willowbushes on the bor∣der of the Polni higher up that river are larches pines birches and alders and some few pinetrees Near the icy sea grow some little larches and alders but they creep upon the ground like espaliers or like  the shrubs in high mountains In Obdorskaja the sum∣mer is very delightful by the continual presence of the sun though it be but short During the long days the sun at night is but one hour invisible hiding it∣self behind an adjacent mountain but does not sink below the horizon At this time at night when near the horizon it is very large and its light so weak that it may be looked at stedfastly with the naked eye On the th of July the sun set so that the stars be∣came visible In wintertime the long light does not last more than two or three hours except when the brilliant northern lights illumine the nocturnal hemis∣phere About Obdorskaja one never hears the bustling noise which many of these phenomena make in the air They commonly appear like bright bows about the ho∣rizon from which issue some very agile light columns Seldom is a tempest heard here in summer never above once or twice in the whole district but thunder is commonly heard as at a distance rolling from north to south The weather is scarce ever so warm as to render a light furdress insupportable On his journey to the glacial sea Mr Surjef felt but five days so warm that he could say he sweated or could go with∣out a fur In July the northern winds begin white frosts and ice is not uncommon and the plants turn yellow The largest radishes and turneps they can raise at Obdorskaja weigh somewhat more than five ounces but the leaves grow a foot long No other gardenstuff thrives at all The ground thaws only on  the surface and near Obdorskaja the elevated flat soil becomes wet nine twelve or fifteen inches deep lower on it is scarce six inches deep Further north∣ward the ground is higher and sandy to the depth of six or eight inches In watry spots we see bare ice underneath the moss that covers them No large cat∣tle brought to Obdorskaja ever lived so long as five years Horses can be kept no where north of Bere∣sowa Some were once brought to Obdorskaja but they did not live a year For this reason they keep only reindeer which are here at home and multiply very fast in spite of many disorders and the danger of wild beasts Of course these animals make a considerable part of the property both of the Russian and pagan inhabitants of these northern lands  Preparations for his further journey on the borders the glacial sea detained Mr Surjef till the end of June He wanted provisions and attendants who were here increased by some Samojedes and their wives who offered their service as guides and as in∣terpreters and also a great number of reindeer to change for these animals soon grow weary The northern borders of Siberia towards the coast of the frozen sea is to the breadth of some hundred miles a watry mossy and woodless marsh in which it is difficult to travel even in summertime but as I have observed there being underneath the moss ice or  frozen earth welltrodden by reindeer the light sledges of the Samojedes glide easily away on the moist moss surface which would by no means bear a wheel  On the st of July Mr Surjef proceeded on his journey and the next day he went in a boat down the Polni and across the Ob and some other parts of the country to the distance of miles passing se∣veral settlements to a place where the reindeer were in readiness to convey him on In one settlement consisting of yourts or tents lives the governor of the Samojedes of Obdorskaja and the Eastjaiks His fa∣ther was presented at Moscow by the present Em∣press with robes and a diploma but died there be∣fore his return  On the d Mr Surjef and his suite set out with reindeer and took the landroad inwards from the river Ob straight north over even marshy lands green with all sorts of reedgrass and a few plants with creeping willows and largeleaved dwarf birches  Betula nana  and several others besides the  Arbutus alpina  the more elevated yet moist and loamy places were ornamented with little scattered larches They also passed many lakes of various extent and the same day reached the river Chaja which flows from the mountains into the gulph of the Ob The breadth of this river was fathoms the stream very rapid  and the water as bright as chrystal Travelling on they reached on the th of July those mountains which make part of the northern Ural The road here was very difficult for the reindeer some of whom dropped and could not be brought upon their legs again even by bleeding which operation the Samo∣jedes perform under their tail After a good day's journey which in summertime does not exceed or miles on account of the frequent changing of the reindeer and the loss of time on that account they crossed two very rapid rivers above fathoms broad  On the th the Samojedes ran till noon before they could bring the reindeer together of which were to go with them and which on account of tor∣menting insects had retreated into cool vallies of course they could not get far that day From the th to the th they passed only a wild barren country full of capes and lakes the icy sea in sight all the way and pitching their tents at night at which time they made fires to keep themselves warm and as they passed through a country where there was no wood they were obliged to take wood with them The water of the frozen sea is so cold that a bather in summertime could not stay in it a few moments without being benumbed and it would be death to a delicate constitution Having travelled along the coast more than three weeks the extent of Mr Surjef's route  was completed and as the severity of the weather opposed a farther continuation he set out on his return the th of July and reached Obdorskaja again on the th of August  In his tour he collected a number of plants and marine productions but the names of them would be of little amusement to a general rea∣der as none were very curious or new  Who would believe that the remains of elephants bones so fre∣quently found in Siberia should also be met with so far north Yet it is certain that the Samojedes find them in great abundance  Before Mr Surjef left the district of Obdorskaja he made two other excursions in spite of the severe autumnal weather one with reindeer towards the Uralian mountains and the other by water to the gulph where the Ob flows into the ocean  He set out for the first on the th of August and returned to Obdorskaja on the d In his way he crossed the river Sob near its mouth where it was fathoms broad and came to a granite mountain whose summit reached the clouds and was covered with snow that fell between the full and new moon of July During the night they travelled along this moun∣tain where the wolves fell upon the reindeer and so dispersed them that they could scarce get sufficient to bring them back for these deer accompany the sledges though turned loose  The second tour he undertook on the th of August in a boat On the th of September he returned from Obdorskaja to Beresowa and on his return to me brought me a young seabear alive and an enormous buffalo's skull which he found in the earth the breadth of which between the horns is Paris inches the breadth before the horns inches the length of the hornholes inches and the circumference ¾ inches  Having thus given a short account of his tour I shall speak of the pagan inhabitants their hunting and fisheries and shall begin with the Ostiacks or Eastjaiks of whom I trust I shall give a more complete account than any that has been hitherto given  Eastjacks  At the beginning of the th cen∣tury  says Dr  Gmelin  when the Russians had extended their conquests as far as the Jenisei these Eastjaiks were in possession of the desarts they now occupy along the banks of that river and the rivers that empty into it They were then near neigh∣bours of the Samojedes with whom they were in some measure mixed In they not only sub∣mitted to Russia themselves but their princes gave all their assistance to bring the people settled higher up into the same subjection  Those on the river Ob are one of the first Siberian nations that were dis∣covered  and conquered by the Russians and like most Siberian tribes since their conquest have very much diminished by the smallpox and other diseases for∣merly unknown to them yet they still make a con∣siderable body of people especially in the district of Beresowa extending up the Ob as far as the districts of Narym and Surgut  They are in general middlingsized people and short not very strong and particularly thin and lean Their faces are disagreeable pale and flat yet with∣out any characteristic form The ruddy and lightcoloured hair that hangs about the head of the men renders them still more ugly Among the women grown to full age we scarce meet with a fine face The Eastjaiks are timorous superstitious and simple but otherwise have a tolerable share of goodnature They are from their youth laborious being obliged to put up with a troublesome and bad way of living but as soon as they find themselves a little above indi∣gence they are slothful especially the men and in their whole domestic management very disgustful and filthy  The dress both of men and women is singular and consists chiefly of the skins of animals and furs which they prepare themselves The richer wear shirts but the common people wear their leathern coats next their skin The man's dress is first a narrow underfur  with sleeves  Mauliza  which scarce reaches halfway the loins having a hole above to put the head through close behind and before This is commonly made with the skin of a reindeer fawn which drops in spring and is put on instead of a shirt with the hair inwards The most usual upperfur or garment which is worn also in summer when the weather is cold is what they call  Sarga  or  Parka  and consists of a reindeer skin sewed together and worn with the hair inwards It is almost like the Mauliza except that behind the opening through which the head passes hangs a hood which occasionally is thrown over the head They generally border the hood and seams of the garment with dog'sskin and is often worn in summer without the under fur In the represent∣ation given is an Eastjaik in his undergarment and one in his uppergarment In winter they wear a fur over both and also a cap made of longhaired reindeer skin called  Gus  In summertime those who wish to appear genteeler than ordinary make themselves a Mauliza of several pieces of cloth of va∣rious colours without lining and bordered with a white dog'sskin or the tails of icefoxes Some in the upper district of the Ob wear in rainy weather fishskin clothes which when they are hungry and in want of other food they put into a kettle boil and eat The common breeches of the men are made of dyed reindeer skins or quabskins are cut to sit close on them but do not reach the knees On their legs they  EASTJAIKS  wear short stockings made of the fawn of the reindeer and over these boots made of the footskin of the same animal the parts between the hoof are fast∣ened together for the sole of their boots being more solid and as preventing their slipping on the snow Such boots are exported by Russian merchants and worn when travelling in winter both by Russians and the people of Siberia  The women wear next their skin a kind of bedgown made of fur and open all the way before they are not very wide yet sufficiently so as to lap over and tie together This is the only garment they wear they take care to keep it close before but are not per∣mitted to wear a girdle They never wear any breeches and as they go barefooted in summer was it not for this furgarment they would be quite naked In win∣ter at home they wear stockings like the men their hair is braided into two tresses behind which hang down the back and are tied together by a string Added to this the more wealthy fasten on the hair be∣hind two long strips of good cloth which reach to the joint of the knee and are decorated with brass and cop∣perplates representing little horses reindeer fish and other figures Those that have not much hair wind a piece of cloth about their heads which crosses behind and hangs down the back in two long strips Both men and women wear long pendants in their ears of beads of several colours strung on a wire or  string and several men wear rings in their ears As soon as any one enters their tent whether strangers or relations the women cover their whole heads with a linen veil and will not be unveiled even before their own mother These veils are called  Woksche  are worked on the borders and ornamented with fringes This is not an affected but a real blushing modesty in the Eastjaik girls and women and is carried so far that whenever a stranger arrives they endeavour to leave the tent or hide themselves in a corner  Among the women it is reckoned an ornament to mark the back of the hands and the forepart of the arm with various bluish figures and points for this purpose they draw the figure they mean to mark upon their skins with foot and prick it with needles till it bleeds in so doing the prick given with the needle leaves a blue speck and the figure being so pricked all over remains on the skin in use Men only prick on their hands that sign by which they are re∣gistered in the taxbook and which is considered by other Siberians unskilled in writing as their signature in law The men will also occasionally prick all sorts of figures upon their shoulders and other parts of their body where they have scarified themselves in case of sickness As the Eastjaik women ornament themselves in this respect as do the Tunguse and some nations in North America so have they like the women in Kamschatka another ridiculous and peculiar custom  that of wearing continually in the  vagina  a tent twisted together and made of soft willowbast scraped which they occasionally remove and often change and lest this tent should fall from its situation by the motion of the body they have fancied a girdle  Worop  formed like those chastitygirdles invented by the jealousy of our southern Europeans from which passes a band between the legs covering the whole with a piece of birchbark sewed to ita contrivance that at certain times is not without its use  As other nomades are called shepherds the Eastjaiks may be called a nation of fishermen for fishing dur∣ing the whole summer and in part of the winter is their chief occupation Hunting and birdcatching is an occasional employ but deserves a description equally with their fisheries Such being the life of an Eastjaik it is naturally unsettled of course in summertime they move their habitations to places most adapted for fishing but like the Baskirians and some Siberian Tartars have settled habitations in win∣ter to which they annually return  A summertent  Chat  is made without much al∣teration the birchbark which covers it is carried with them in boats made of hollow trees enlarged with boards fastened on them as are also the poles with which they form their tents these poles are set close toge∣ther in form of pyramids and covered with the bark  In these boats they go with their wives and children and all that belongs to themI speak this only of such Eastjaiks as live beyond Beresowa for higher up the country most of them live in huts built of timber have benches to sleep on and in many points con∣form to the Russian mode of living  They chuse for their winter abodes high and dry spots or the banks of neighbouring rivers Here they build with young timber regular square huts similar to a Russian house but low sometimes half under∣ground and without a roof instead of which they cover the top with turf and leaves leaving only a square airhole which they cover in winter with a transparent piece of ice On each side of this house is an open passage fenced in in which are two closets where they keep their superfluous furs and necessaries Such huts are inhabited by more than one family and the place within the walls is divided into as many apartments as there are families Though nar∣row and confined the mother must put up with one room for the children and the whole family who do their work before a small fire It may easily be con∣ceived that there cannot be the best order in such a room where all things must lie littered about three four nay six families shall live together in such a hut Beyond Beresowa there are but few huts or jourts that have not thirty families in each Those mothers who have infants have a cradle made of  birchbark before their house and fill it with any fine and bruised rotten wood they can find which serves the infant as a bed and all the wet such infant makes is absorbed in this wooddust The cradle is covered with a piece of fur fastened to it by strings The beds of such as are grown up are made on the bare ground with reindeer furs and hay except in such rooms where there are benches to lie on underneath which their favourite dogs lie especially those who have whelps Common sledgedogs lie without the house yet when the master wants to go out they are ad∣mitted within to be fed In the centre of the jourt is a common fire pretty large where every one dresses his victuals when he pleases for they have no regular meals and here they also roast the remains of what fish they leave for the dogs From this continual roasting the cielings of their winterdwellings are so much covered with foot that it hangs down like isicles One may easily judge of the offensive smell and damps at entering such a hut from whence no dirt or filth made by men or dogs is removed and where even children perform their occasional and necessary wants without going out  Beside these winterhuts they build often at a little distance from them in the woods places to store their provisions in  Labassy  where they leave all their furs skins and other articles for which they have no imme∣diate use without the least care and what the place  will not hold is left without on their sledges and is perfectly safe no theft being ever committed  The filthiness of this nation cannot be painted suffi∣ciently disgustful Washing of hands is unknown among them except when the women open a fish or take it out of the boiler at which time they wash off the filth and dry their hands in their furs Men and animals eat out of the same vessel which is never cleaned As their feltlike hair swarms with vermin the most filthy of all their actions is that of the women at their leisure picking such vermin from their hus∣band's heads and killing them with all possible calm∣ness between their teeth The rich Eastjaiks how∣ever from imitation are become so cleanly as to make a kind of soap because what the Russians use is too scarce and dear and not strong enough to clean their hands which are comparatively speaking an inch thick with grease This soap is made by putting a good quantity of sharp ashes into a kettle of water and pouring by degrees fishfat into the lye which they boil together till it settles and becomes soap They then take it out in pieces tie it up in rags and when they wash their hands squeeze it like a sponge but the common Eastjaiks have no such cleanly thing One reason of their filthiness is that the women have too much domestic business on their hands and are con∣sidered by their husbands rather as slaves than consorts The wife erects the tent pulls it down dresses the  victuals drys and mends her husband's clothes and serves him in every thing and when the husband returns from hunting or fishing she must clean and dress the fish The men take nothing on themselves but the business of fishing and hunting  The manner in which these women dress their skins is a good one as they keep out the wet I will therefore describe it Two tools are used for this purpose first a small iron to the middle of which is fixed a wooden handle and whose two ends are crooked and sharp with these they scrape the raw skins first on the fleshside This done they chew fishroe or dried fishbellies in their mouths and spread it over the skin which is rolled up and laid aside to become moist They then take another scraping iron which looks like a narrow sickle with two wooden handles one at each end through these handles a rope is drawn which they sling round their foot hold the Iron between their legs and scrape the fleshside of the skins clean After this they are dried in the tent or hut and worked soft with the hands  It is the chewed fishroe that renders them impenetrable by water  As it is only the more wealthy Eastjaiks beyond Be∣resowa that keep reindeer and we see other domestic cattle only among those who live more to the south towards Tobolskoi most of them must live by fishing During the whole summer both young and old are so  occupied and even children are kept to work accord∣ing to their strength in this line In this season they have such an abundance of fish that they eat nothing else and they seldom think of boiling or roasting them but cut off the flesh as it comes fresh out of the water sauce it with its blood which flows plentifully from about the tail when pricked with a needle take one long slice after another into their mouths cutting the bits very skilfully below their lips of course in summer their mouths and clothes stink worse than a fishmarket In winter they are fond of raw frozen fish and are imitated in this by the neighbouring Russians who eat it so as a preservative against the scurvy  Far more fish is caught in summertime than they are able to eat or barter with the Russians In the lower districts of the Ob the smaller sorts which they do not know how to dispose of are thrown away and lie about in heaps untouched even by the dogs They preserve their fish in three different ways the whole sides of large whitings are taken from the bones dried in the wind and to prevent putresaction are halfroasted and then tied up in bundles and called  Poseem  The best of this kind of food is a fish of pas∣sage caught in the Ob which they call  Muksun  After drying it is put into a kettle and stirred about on the fire till it becomes brown then stowed away in vessels made of birchbark or the stomach of the reindeer  The bones are dried and roasted and given to the dogs  Jutta  is a food made like Poseem of smaller fishes and put away in bags made of the skin of a sturgeon  Porsa  is a little species of scale fish split and dried in the wind and then with the bones pounded as fine as flour Poseem is their most usual food but to their guests they present Muksun and Poseem together so that one is used as bread to the other If these pro∣visions fail they put up with the Jutta Porsa is given dried and seldom boiled Fresh fish is only boiled for guests and what they leave the family eats and on such occasions they plunge their filthy hands into the kettle up to their elbows In winter they make a soup or fishbroth and put flour in it this they learnt from the Russians and throw it down their throats with large spoons The entrails of fishes the Eastjaiks make no use of but boil out the fat and dispose of it to the Russians who eat it as butter on their fastdays The backsinews are seldom dressed these are usually eaten raw without a knife Eating with a knife is held ominous of unsuccessful fishing The same thing they fear if a fish's belly is slit strait down the wo∣men therefore cut them across  They make glue of the sturgeon's airbladder by cleaning it from the fat drying it in the air boiling it in water till it swims at top and then skimming it and cooling it in cold water  Hunting is one of the men's winteroccupations and in winter they fish underneath the ice In autumn when the first snow salls they hunt elks and reindeer and he that kills makes a feast for his friends The kidnies lights and other soft parts are eaten like the melt raw part of the flesh is boiled and the rest smoked  In winter the Eastjaiks travel in their snowshoes far into the desarts and forests and do not return for some months drawing their food with them on small sledges Hunting weapons are all sorts of arrows some with a forklike point others with bonepoints and others clubbed at the end to kill small animals with If they kill any large animals in any great number they flea them bury the flesh in the deep snow in a spot they can find again and fetch it at some other time with reindeer or dogs They will eat the flesh of bears foxes squirrels and dead car∣cases without disgust When an Eastjaik is exposed to severe cold pain and hunger he has recourse to tobacco which does him a great deal of service so that they are fond of smoking and taking snuff and as their tobacco is not very strong they quicken it with the most alkaline ashes of birch and asp spurges After filling their nostrils with snuff they stop them with scraped willowbast so that the pungent sharp juice shall raise a kind of inflammation in the face which keeps off the frost I must not omit here their su∣perstition  in hunting When an Eastjaik goes a hunt∣ing he wishes to sneeze the day before and considers this as a happy presage but should he find himself disposed to sneeze the morning he sets out he will make all possible grimaces to prevent it and should he sneeze after all nothing can exceed his vexation con∣ceiving that every time he sneezes will deprive him of part of his sport for that day nay some on such an occasion will not go out at all  In spring the birds of passage claim their attention and afford them delicious food Their manner of catching them shall be circumstantially related  Notwithstanding their unnatural food their drink except brandy which they barter for with the Russians and drink on the spot is water only I say notwithstanding this they are a healthy people and among youth we seldom hear of disease But if from age and infirmities they are unable to follow their occupations they are commonly attacked with such stubborn scorbutic and paralytic disorders as never to rise again They know nothing of inflammatory com∣plaints except the smallpox which makes dreadful ravage among children when it comes Their man∣ner of living must needs render this disorder fatal and if it enters a village grown people seldom escape Some however remain free all their lives The venereal disease has also found its way among  them but is not so infectious as might be sup∣posed  Medicines they are unacquainted with Their best cure in fits swellings and inflammations is scarifica∣tion or burning on the diseased part a piece of birchspurge and being of opinion that the remedy must be applied to the place where the evil is lodged they first take a burning coal and hold it about the diseased part on different places of the skin till they find a part where the patient does not feel the fire so sensibly there they apply it and keep it till the skin is burnt through and bursts the patient suffering this burning with the patience of a stoic  They cure obstructions with large spoonfuls of fish∣fat and in dangerous cases take crow's eyes Both these are used as an emetic and purge The gall of a white seabear and bear's heart are also medicines of renown among them Dried gall is chiefly used in sick∣ness among children or complaints of the belly and the venereal disease  The Eastjaiks particularly beyond Beresowa who adhere still to paganism take as many wives as they can afford It is legal among them to marry their brother's widow their stepmother or stepdaughter and other female relations They are fond of marrying sisters of other families and believe that men's mar∣rying  with a wife's sister brings good luck and by doing this they pay the father only half the price or kalym first paid but they hold it sinful and disgrace∣ful to marry relations of the same name yet they at∣tend only to the male line If a woman has married into another family and has borne a daughter the brother of the mother or his children may legally marry that daughter In short all marriages are legal if only the father of the bride and bridegroom are of different families  When an Eastjaik goes a courting he chuses from among his nearest relations and friends some com∣panions of his own age and one to be the negotiator goes with them to his sweetheart's dwelling and enters the hut without ceremony A father who has a mar∣riageable daughter seeing such a company arrive rea∣dily guesses the reason therefore makes no question but treats them with what his tent will afford When the guests have filled their bellies they retire to an∣other tent and from thence the bridegroom sends his suitor with the proposals and enquires the kalym or price to be paid The negotiation being entered into the poor suitor runs to and fro from one tent to the other to settle matters between the two till the agree∣ment is concluded on then the bridegroom goes him∣self and pays part of the kalym the whole being sel∣dom paid at once it being proportioned to the fortune the father gives with his daughter A rich Eastjaik  girl is not married without a gift of reindeer and an assortment of all kinds of furs The first instal∣ment being paid the bridegroom directs the father to have a bed prepared for him in his hut and to have his daughter ready If the fatherinlaw agrees to this and accepts the first payment the bridegroom comes that night and lays on the spot or bed appointed for him Some time after the bride lies down near him on a separate bench and covered with a particular fur till the fires are put out Next morning the girl's mother enquires of the bridegroom whether he is satisfied with her daughter If he replies in the affirmative he must present the mother with a gar∣ment and a reindeer and the mother then cuts the reindeer's skin on which the young couple lay into pieces and spreads it around in triumph but should the bridegroom be dissatisfied the mother gives him a reindeer The bridegroom after this sleeps with his bride but cannot take her home till the whole of the kalym or purchasemoney is paid Sometimes it shall happen that when the father is weak or ill and cannot follow the husband shall take away his wife before the sum agreed on is paid in such cases the father takes the opportunity at some future time when his daughter comes to pay him a visit to detain her and force the husband to pay what is owing  No married woman can appear before her fatherinlaw whilst she lives nor the bridegroom before his mother inlaw until he has children They must avoid them as much as possible and if they chance to meet them must turn their backs and cover their faces Girls in Eastjaik families have no names the husband therefore calls his consort  wife  Jemi and the wo∣men call their husbands  man  Tahe  Though the uncivilized Eastjaik does not consider his wife but as a necessary domestic animal and scarcely favours her with a good word for all her hard labour yet he dare not strike her even for the greatest crime unless he has the consent of her father for in such a case the provoked wife would run to her parents and persuade her father to return the kalym to his soninlaw and she would marry some other man  These people know little about jealousy they are much addicted to bestiality and their marriages are seldom very prolific Few fathers have more than three or four children probably a father's neglect of his children may shorten their days and rob him of part of them Though mothers shew a greater fond∣ness and will let their infants suck as long as they like even to the fifth year The women here are easily delivered and the afterbirth and willow∣bast on which they lie is put into a box of birch∣bark and with some meat or fish added to it su∣perstitiously  hung upon a tree in some distant wood It is said that should a poor Eastjaik woman be deli∣vered of a child on the road when travelling and where they cannot stop long for want of victuals the husband will give her a good dose of fishglue boiled and this will enable her to proceed  They have particular buryingplaces of their own called  Chalas  A corpse is not kept long aboveground he that dies in the morning is interred at noon Their graves are made generally only two feet deep because in most places the frozen ground is too hard to be dug into deeper The deceased is dressed in his best clothes according to the season of the year is put on a bench and all things near him which he used for instance his knife axe tobaccohorn filled c except his flint and firesteel which are only given to the dead carved in wood The relations and neigh∣bours of the deceased assemble in his jourt and de∣plore him with great howling The women sit toge∣ther with their faces veiled and the men stand la∣menting over the body Instead of a coffin they bring a little boat whose fore and hind part is cut off put the deceased with all his things into it and carry him to his grave Men are borne by men and wo∣men are carried by women only to the place of inter∣ment which is usually on some height In the latter case the corpse is followed by some men to dig the grave and is interred with shrieks of woe The corpse  of a man is followed by three of the best and most fa∣vourite reindeer he possessed dressed and harnessed in sledges and led on by men As soon as the body is interred and covered with earth they put a cord round the hindlegs of the deer which two men pull whilst four others run them through the bodies on all sides with pointed poles When rich men are buried they kill many more reindeer putting slings about their necks and feet and beating them about the back with poles till they drop down dead These animals sacrificed to the deceased remain on the grave their housings are laid on a kind of scaffold made over it with bushes and the sledges are placed slanting up against it Near the grave they dress a funeral meal and when those who attend are satisfied carry the re∣mainder home and divide it among the neighbours in remembrance of their deceased friend and the re∣lations will afterwards sometimes celebrate such meals of remembrance  Before the Eastjaiks were subject to the Russian em∣pire they had little princes among them whose dig∣nity was hereditary Some of their posterity are still in being but not much respected living in the man∣ner of the common people by their labour If these princes left no male issue the elders and most wealthy chose a successor from among themselves If any dis∣pute happens among the people these settle it by ar∣bitration or refer the matter to their princes but if  the cause is brought before any Russian court of judi∣cature it is adjusted by the evidence of the parties and the following oath is usually administered A wooden idol being brought the defendant is reminded of the danger of taking a false oath and constrained to cut off the idol's nose with an axe or knife and in∣jure it other ways during this he must repeat after the interpreter the following words  If I do not speak the truth in this cause let my nose be cut off in the same manner let me be hewn in pieces by an axe let the beasts of the forest tear me and every misfortune come upon me  By the same oath the witnesses are sworn and out of superstitious fear will rather confess they are in the wrong than expose them∣selves to the punishment of their gods If they are to swear allegiance to a new sovereign they are assem∣bled in little circles an axe is placed in the middle with which a bear or bearskin has been cut in pieces and each person is presented with a bit of bread on the point of a knife during this he is to take the oath of allegiance as follows  If I do not remain faith∣ful to the Empress to the end of my life if I re∣volt or do not pay my tribute or if I leave my country or do any other act of perfidy let me torn by the bear or choked with this bread I eat  This is the English Corsned oath Hence the expression "May this morsel be my last"  let the axe cut off my head or let me be killed by this  knife  This done they kneel down about a bear's skin and lay hold of it with their teeth biting it and many to shew their zeal will tear out the hairs with their teeth Similar obligations on oath are custom∣ary with a bear's skin among most of the heathens in Siberia  The Eastjaik language is like that of Finland and the Woguls There are also divers dialects of this language Among the Finnish dialects there is none more like the Eastjaik than the Mordvine As an example I will give a list of words in the Eastjaik Wogulian and Mordvine languages and the simi∣arity will be readily seen  ENGLISH  EASTJAIK  WOGUL

even of many that are bap∣tized Those who among their magicians profess pa∣ganism have their idols at home which are clumsily carved puppets with a human face clothed with rags and put in the best corner of the tent Before each idol they place a little wooden box in which the wor∣shiper presents his god with little presents and keeps always for him a hornfull of snuff and scraped wil∣lowbast but if this little wooden god should find him∣self disposed to take a pinch of snuff he may stuff his nostrils with the bast in the Eastjaik mode They in∣dustriously smear the idol's mouth with fishfat and do him every honour in their way Some Eastjaiks have deified pieces of logwood little boxes and other things they have bought from the Russians Such things they decorate in the best manner they can with rings and ribbands and worship them as others do their wood∣en puppets It is truly laughable to see the effect of a Russian traveller's taking out at night when they are all asleep the tobacco from the horn and leaving the horn in its place the simple Eastjaik in such a case supposes that the idol has taken all the snuff is sur∣prised at it and thinks that he must certainly have been hunting It can scarcely be credited that such a people could be so blind and ridiculous as to knock down the idol from its place and break it in pieces by various methods when they are in trouble and the god will not succour them though they held the idol  in the greatest veneration before This is often in use among the Eastjaiks but scarce ever seen in any other pagan nation in Siberia  They also deify in a certain manner their deceased relations making wooden images to represent some dead person they respected and set at the remem∣berancemeals their portion before them Women that loved their husbands will take these puppets tobed at night dress them and never omit plac∣ing some victuals besore them when they eat them∣selves  The Eastjaiks worship also certain trees and mountains that have excited devout ideas or have been considered as such by their magicians They never pass such trees or mountains without shooting an arrow at them which is a kind of worship they pay to these objects But the greatest adoration and most common great sacrifices are only made to certain eminent people consecrated by their magicians To these they fly for refuge in extraordinary cases of mis∣fortune or danger wherein the sorcerers play the principal part in order to bring the poor people by their impositions under a blind obedience  The idols at present worshiped by all the East∣jaiks of the river Ob and the neighbouring Samo∣jedes are in the environs of the tents of Wasarskaja  a great way beyond Obdorskaja They stand in a woody vale where they are carefully watched and every passage to them concealed from the Russians Before these idols of which there are two they assem∣ble in great numbers to perform their sacrifices One is dressed in a male dress the other in a female and both are splendidly decked out in the Eastjaik way and no cloth or furs spared to make them complete Their garments are richly ornamented with brass and iron plates in form of animals and on their heads are silver garlands Each stands on a selected tree in his own jurt or hut the trunks of the trees are covered with cloth and other stuff and at the top decorated with a white iron plate with a bell hanging on it that is shaken and rung by the wind Quivers and bows are also hung on the tree of the male pagod and on all the adjacent trees a number of skins of reindeer victims and other sorts of furs Round about the idols is a great deal of Eastjaik houshold utensils as kettles spoons cups tobacco∣horns c The men pay their devotions only to the male idol but the women sometimes assemble before the female idol led on by a magician of their own sex and bring her sacrifices and presents  The Eastjaiks formerly had in many places in the woods trees they worshipped and presented with skins and sacrifices but finding that Cossack tra∣vellers made no scruple to save these skins suspended  in the air from putrefaction by putting them to a better use they contented themselves with cutting large branches of these trees dressing them up and erecting them in more secure places and there bringing them presents  All the districts whose environs are consecrated to an idol are spared by the Eastjaiks so as that they nei∣ther fell wood or make hay in such places nor will they hurt a fish or drink there lest they should pro∣voke the anger of the god If they pass such a district by water they take care nor to come too near the shore nor touch the land with their oars and should the district be extensive they take sufficient water with them before they come to it as they would rather die with thirst than attempt to drink any water from such a consecrated river  All those places where idols were formerly wor∣shiped by their ancestors are now well known to posterity and if some new place is chosen it is from the caprice of those magicians that are most respected A district full of game shall be consecrated by art∣ful magicians to an idol and a tree on which an eagle hath built her nest for two years together is de∣clared sacred and they dare not molest that eagle There could be no greater offence than for a passen∣ger to kill such eagle and the teachers and supporters of so absurd a superstition are the roguish magicians  or schamans Any officers sent by Imperial command to make any the least reform which does not please the Eastjaiks puts the whole nation into such terror and consternation and the magicians take the advantage of these times to relate fictitious dreams to the peo∣ple or threaten them with the anger of the gods or some heavier punishment and they get from them as many presents by way of sacrifice as will maintain them a long time These schamans are commonly so cunning in the beginning as to tread themselves a path to such a respectable situation as they stand in with these people by relations and interpretations of dreams and afterwards improve themselves in the arts of knavery and deception Superstition has so strong an influence on the minds of some people that they are often terrified at the greatest trifles as I shall have oc∣casion to shew  The opportunities to practise magic knowledge here are cases of misfortune horrid dreams unsuccessful hunting or fishing and other accidents The East∣jaik sorcerers make use of a drum like most Siberian schamans and in their magic spells make horrible contortions of their bodies and faces before large fires till the devils which they have brought forth as they pretend have given them a proper answer All those that are present make during the contortions an un∣interrupted noise with kettles cups c as loud as they can and cry out till they fancy they see a blue  smoke over the magician's head who after the fit feigns to be for some time weak and out of his senses  The other principal occupation of the sorcerers is ordering the general offerings or sacrifices which they command the timid people to make as they please in all extraordinary cases I do not speak of little offerings as the Eastjaiks of themselves often carry the idol small presents and ornaments game fresh fish and prostrate themselves before it and after performing supplications boil the sacrifice and smear the idol's mouth with the fat or broth but I speak of greater sacrifices where many reindeer are killed for the gods and where the schaman is present The following then is the ceremony Having bound the reindeer's legs together the schaman stands before the idol and bawls out as loud as he can the suppli∣cation of him who offers to the gods and so do the bystanders Then some one with a bent bow and arrow stands before the reindeer and when the ma∣gician with a staff gives the signal on the head of the victim he shoots it with the arrow and another kills it outright with a pointed lance or pole They next take the animal by the tail and drag it thrice round the pagod cut it open squeeze out the blood from the heart and smear the idol's mouth therewith The head and skin is suspended on an adjacent tree and the meat boiled and eaten with shouts of joy What∣ever  the Eastjaiks think of serves for a song if only bawled in a singing tone and such are the hymns of these sacrifices At parting every one cries out as loud as he can waves his arms in the air and thus gives his idol thanks and a farewell The meat not eaten is taken home and divided among their wives child∣ren and neighbours first greasing the mouths of their domestic idols with the fat  When great and general sacrifices are to be per∣formed the rich Eastjaiks drive their best reindeer in whole herds to be killed and scarcely keep those who are most useful to them In such cases they know how to slaughter the poor victims barbarously and expeditiously for the sooner a reindeer falls and dies the more acceptable to the idol is the offering supposed to be A rich man would blush on such oc∣casions to offer less than eight or ten reindeer Be∣sides this they hang up the best furs they have to the idol as a present and leave them a prey to wind and weather Offerings are also made in severe sicknesses according to the number ordered by the magicians The victims are placed before the door of the patient's hut and giving into the hand of the rich man a rope tied on the reindeer's foot the friends and relations standing with the magician on the outside of the hut call upon the idol till the patient draws the rope by accident or intentionally which is looked upon as a signal to kill the victim and he is slaughtered accord∣ingly  Of such sacrifices the skin is destined for do∣mestic use the head and horns put upon a pale the flesh eaten and the forehead and afflicted parts of the sick man greased with the sat  When the Eastjaiks have shewn their prowess in killing a bear the following ceremony attends it The skin is hung upon a high tree all sorts of reverence is paid it and the best apologies made to the animal for its being killed By doing this they hope to avert in a polite way the injury which might otherwise be done them by the spirit of the animal  Some such customs are prevalent in Lapland  All or most of these superstitious customs are the same among all old Siberian pagans  Particular mention deserves to be made of the dances of the Eastjaiks which are quite national and truly remarkable I saw them performed by Russians who dwelt long among the Eastjaiks and their ridiculous attitudes cannot better be compared than to a bur∣lesque pantomime They divert themselves thus at their entertainments and particularly when they have obtained a good deal of brandy by barter from the Russians It is the men only who dance the wo∣men are merely spectators and it requires no small adroitness strength and agility for they always dance till they sweat In these dances they represent the  proceedings of their ancestors in chace of a variety of animals and birds and even a fishing Sometimes they imitate the conduct and walk of the most im∣portant animals and birds and satirize the gait of their neighbours all in musical cadence which the player varies according to the various imitations In a very droll and laughable manner do they represent the chace of the sable the manners of the crane and elk and the flight and preying of the mousehawk the man∣ner of the Russian women washing themselves and other pleasant subjects The most difficult representation appeared to me to be that of the crane when the dancer squats down hides himself in a fur the collar of which he fastens round a long stick which at top re∣sembles the head of a crane and thus squatting and almost bent double he dances and imitates with the stick all the motions of a crane At the representation of the elk the music imitates the several actions of the animal walking trotting and galloping and the dancer makes all the grimaces of that animal when he is throwing about his eyes in search of the huntsman who is after him No one could suppose so much skill and so many wellfancied attitudes among so rude a nation Their most favourite dances are satyric representations and they are fond of ridiculing particular persons in songs the extemporaneous effusions of their own brain when either drunk or jovial  Besides these dances and songs they divert them∣selves occasionally with stories which turn sometimes on loveadventures and sometimes on old incredible boasted feats of heroism They tell one of a mighty and valiant Eastjaik who going a courting travelled from Obdorskaja to a distance of miles beyond the Soswa in hours without any change of reindeer and not being able to agree with the father of his girl carried her off in a little time and being on this ac∣count obliged to fight with her relations killed with his own hand several thousands of them and so on This piece of chivalry is believed by the Eastjaiks as true some part of it may be so but it is converted into fable by posterity  The musical instruments of this people are the  Dombra  exactly like the Wogulian lute and some few species of little harps called  Dernoboi  which consist of a longsounding triangular box covered on the top with a soundingboard and strung with strings which the player touches boldly pressing down the thinsounding board with his thumb to give the tones a wavering motion To one end of this box is fixed a swan's neck  To strangers the Eastjaiks are very hospitable and do not know how to pay sufficient honour and respect to their guests If they have any reindeer they will  kill one immediately and set before their friend the tongue brains and breast boiled in their way and considered by them as delicacies After the meal they will make their guest such a present as they can afford without expecting any return  END OF THE THIRD VOLUME  ADDENDA
