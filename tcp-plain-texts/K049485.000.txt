 The Ambitious Stepmother A TRAGEDY  As 'twas Acted at the  New Theatre  in  LittleLincolnsInnFields  By His Majesty's Servants  By  N Rowe  Esq    Decet haec dare dona noveream  Ovid Metam lib  Vane Ligur frustra{que} animis elate superbis  Nequicquam tent√¢sti lubricus artes  Advenit qui vestra dies muliebribus armis  Verba redargueret  Virg Aen lib  LONDON  rinted for  Peter Buck  at the Sign of the  Temple  near the  InnerTempleGate  in  Fleetstreet    TO THE Right Honourable THE Earl of Jersey Lord Chamberlain of his Majesty's Houshold  c  My Lord  IF any thing may attone for the Liberty I take in offering this trifle to your Lordship it is that I will Engage not to be guilty of the Common Vice of Dedications nor pretend to give the World an account of the many good qualities they ought to admire in your Lordship I hope I may reckon on it as some little piece of merit in an age where there are so many people write Panegyricks and so few deserve 'em I am sure you ought not to sit for your Picture to so ill a hand as mine Men of your Lordship's Figure and Station tho Useful and Ornamantal to the Age they live in are yet reserv'd for the Labours of the Historian and the Entertainment of Posterity nor ought to be aspers'd with such pieces of Flattery while living as may render the true History suspected  to those that come after That which should take up all my Care at present is most humbly to beg your Lordships pardon for Importuning you upon this account for imagining that your Lordship whose hours are all dedicated to the best and most important uses can have any leisure for this piece of Poetry I beg my Lord that you will receive it as it was meant a mark of my Entire Respect and Veneration  I hope it may be some advantage to me that the Town has not receiv'd this Play ill to have depended meerly upon your Lordships good nature and have offer'd something without any degree of merit would have been an unpardonable fault especially to so good a Judge The Play it self as I present it to your Lordship is a much more perfect Poem than it is in the representation on the Stage I was led into an Error in the writing of it by thinking that it would be easier to retrench than to add But when I was at last necessitated by reason of the extreme length to cut off near six hundred Lines I found that it was maim'd by it to a great disadvantage The Fable which has no manner of relation to any part of true History was left dark and intricate for want of a great part of the narration which was left out in the first Scene and the Chain and Connexion which ought to be in the Dialogue was interrupted in many other places But since what was omitted in the Acting is now kept in I hope it may indifferently Entertain your Lordship at an unbending hour The faults which are most generally found and which I could be very proud of submitting to your Lordship's Judgment if you can have leisure for so trivial a cause are that the Catastrophe in the fifth Act is barbarous and shocks the Audience Some people whose Judgment I ought to have a deference for have told me that they wisht I had given the latter part of the story quite another turn that  Artaxerxes  and  Amestris  ought to have been preserv'd and made happy in the Conclusion of the Play that besides the satisfaction which the Spectators would have had to have seen two Vertuous or at least Innocent Characters rewarded and successful there might have been also a more Noble and Instructive Moral drawn that way I must confess if this be an Error as I perhaps it may it is a voluntary one  and an Error of my Judgment Since in the writing I actually made such a sort of an Objection to my self and chose to wind up the story this way Tragedies have been allow'd I know to be written both ways very beautifully But since Terror and Pity are laid down for the Ends of Tragedy by the great Master and Father of Criticism I was always inclin'd to fancy that the last and remaining Impressions which ought to be left on the minds of an Audience should proceed from one of these two They should be struck with Terror in several parts of the Play but always Conclude and go away with Pity a sort of regret proceeding from good nature which tho an uneasiness is not always disagreeable to the person who feels it It was this passion that the famous Mr  Otway  succeeded so well in touching and must and will at all times affect people who have any tenderness or humanity If therefore I had sav'd  Artaxerxes  and  Amestris  I believe with submission to my Judges I had destroy'd the greatest occasion for Compassion in the whole Play Any body may perceive that she is rais'd to some degrees of happiness by hearing that her Father and Husband are living whom she had suppos'd dead and by seeing the Enemy and Persecuter of her Family dying at her feet purposely that the turn of her death may be more surprizing and pitiful As for that part of the Objection which says that Innocent persons ought not to be shewn unfortunate The success and general approbation which many of the best Tragedies that have been writ and which were built on that foundation have met with will be sufficient answer for me  That which they call the Poetical Justice is I think strictly observ'd the two principal Contrivers of Evil the Statesman and Priest are punish'd with death and the Queen is depos'd from her authority by her own Son which I suppose will be allowed as the severest mortification that could happen to a woman of her Imperious temper  If there can be any excuse for my Entertaining your Lordship with this  Detail  of Criticisms it is That I would have this first mark of the honour I have for your Lordship appear with as few faults as possible Did not the prevailing Character of your Lordship's Excellent humanity and good nature encourage  me what ought I not to fear from the niceness of your Taste and Judgment The delicacy of your reflexions may be very satal to so rough a Draught as this is but if I will believe as I am sure I ought to do all men that I have heard speak of your Lordship they bid me hope every thing from your Goodness This is that I must sincerely own which made me extremely Ambitious of your Lordship's Patronage for this Piece I am but too sensible that there are a multitude of faults in it but since the good nature of the Town has cover'd or not taken notice of 'em I must have so much discretion as not to look with an affected nicety into 'em my self With all the Faults and Imperfections which it may have I must own I shall be yet very well satisfied with it if it gives me an opportunity of reckoning my self from this time  Your Lordship's most Obedient and devoted humble Servant  N Rowe  The Prologue  Spoke by Mr  Batterton  IF Dying Lovers yet deserve a Tear  If a sad story of a Maids despair  Yet move Compassion in the pitying fair  This day the Poet does his Art employ  The soft accesses of your Souls to try  Nor let the Stoick boast his mind unmov'd  The Brute Philosopher who ne're has prov'd  The Joy of Loving or of being Lov'd  Who scorns his humane nature to confess  And striving to be more than man is less  Nor let the men the weeping fair accuse  Those kind protectors of the Tragick Muse  Whose Tears did moving  Otway  's labours crown  And made the poor  Monimia  's Grief their own  Those Tears their art not weakness has confest  Their Grief approv'd the niceness of their taste  And they wept most because they judg'd the best  O cou'd this Age's Writers hope to find  An Audience to Compassion thus inclin'd  The Stage would need no Farce nor Song nor Dance  Nor Capering Monsieur brought from Active  France  Clinch  and his Organ Pipe his Dogs and Bear  To native  Barnet  might again repair  Or breathe with Captain  Otter Bankside  Air  Majestick Tragedy shou'd once agen  In Purple Pomp adorn the swelling Scene  Her search shou'd ransack all the Ancient's store  The Fortunes of their Loves and Arms explore  Such as might grieve you but shou'd please you more  What  Shakespear  durst not this bold Age shou'd do  And famous  Greek  and  Latian  Beauties show  Shakespear  whose Genius to its self a Law  Cou'd men in every height of Nature draw  And Copy'd all but women that he saw  Those Ancient Heroines your concern shou'd move  Their Grief and Anger much but most their Love  For in the account of every Age we find  The best and fairest of that Sex were kind  To Pity always and to Love inclin'd  Assert ye fair ones who in Judgment sit  Your Ancient Empire over Love and Wit  Reform our Sense and teach the men t' Obey  They'll leave their Tumbling if you lead the way  Be but what those before to  Otway  were  O were you but as kind we know you are as fair

Magas  Say how fares the King  Mag  As one whom when we number with the living  We say the most we can tho sure it must  Be happier far to quit a wretched being  Than keep it on such terms For as I enter'd  The Royal Lodging an universal horror  Struck thro my Eyes and chill'd my very Heart  The chearful day was every where shut out  With care and left a more than midnight darkness  Such as might ev'n be felt A few dim Lamps  That feebly lifted up their sickly heads  Lookt faintly thro the shade and made it seem  More dismal by such light while those that waited  In solemn sorrow mixt with wild amazement  Observ'd a dreadful silence  Mirz  Didst thou see him  Mag  My Lord I did treading with gentle steps  I reacht the Bed which held the poor remains  Of great  Arsaces  just as I approacht  His drooping lids that seem'd for ever clos'd  Were faintly rear'd to tell me that he liv'd  The balls of sight dim and depriv'd of motion  Sparkled no more with that Majestick sire  At which ev'n Kings have trembled but had lost  Their common useful office and were shaded  With an eternal night struck with a sight  That shew'd me humane nature faln so low  I hastily retir d  Mirz  He dyes too soon  And fate if possible must be delay d  The thought that labours in my forming brain  Yet crude and immature demands more time  Have the Physicians giv'n up all their hopes  Cannot they add a few days to a Monarch  In recompence of thousand vulgar fates  Which their Drugs daily hasten  Mag  As I past  The outward Rooms I found 'em in Consult  I askt 'em if their art was at a stand  And could not help the King they shook their heads  And in most grave and solemn wise unfolded  Matter which little purported but words  Rankt in right learned phrase all I could learn was  That Nature's kindly warmth was quite extinct  Nor could the breath of art kindle again  Th' Etherial fire  Mirz  My Royal Mistress  Artemisa  's fate  And all her Son Young  Artaban  's high hopes  Hang on this lucky Crisis since this day  The haughty  Artaxerxes  and old  Memnon  Enter  Persepolis  The yearly Feast  Devoted to our glorious God the Sun  Hides their designs under a holy veil  And thus Religion is a mask for Faction  But let their Guardian  Genii  still be watchful  For if they chance to nod my waking vengeance  Shall surely catch that moment to destroy 'em  Mag  'Tis said the fair  Amestris Memnon  's Daughter  Comes in their company  Mirz  That fatal Beauty  With most malignant influence has crost  My first and great Ambition When my Brother  The great  Cleander  fell by  Memnon  's hand  You know the story of our Houses quarrel  I sought the King for Justice on the Murderer  And to confirm my interest in the Court  In confidence of mighty wealth and power  A long descent from Noble Ancestors  And somewhat of the Beauty of the Maid  I offer'd my  Cleone  to the Prince  Fierce  Artaxerxes  he with rude disdain  Refus'd the proffer and to grate me more  Publickly own'd his passion for  Amestris  And in despight ev'n of his Fathers Justice  Espous'd the Cause of  Memnon  Mag  Ev'n from that noted Aera I remember  You dated all your service to the Queen  Our Common Mistress  Mirz  'Tis true I did so Nor was it in vain  She did me right and satisfy'd my vengeance  Memnon  was banisht and the Prince disgrac'd  Went into Exile with him Since that time  Since I have been admitted to her Council  And have seen her with unerring judgment guide  The Reins of Empire I have been amaz'd  To see her more than manly strength of Soul  Cautious in good success in bad unshaken  Still arm'd against the uncertain turns of Chance  Untoucht by any weakness of her Sex  Their Superstition Pity or their Fear  And is a Woman only in her Cunning  What story tells of great  Semiramis  Or Rolling Time that gathers as it goes  Has added more such  Artemisa  is  Mag  Sure 'twas a mark of an uncommon Genius  To bend a Soul like that of great  Arsaces  And Charm him to her sway  Mirz  Certainly Fate  Or somewhat like the force of Fate was in it  And still whene're remembrance sets that scene  Before my eyes I view it with amazement  Mag  I then was young a stranger to the Court  And only took the story as reported  By different Fame you must have known it better  Mirz  Indeed I did then favour'd by the King  And by that means a sharer in the secret  'Twas on a day of publick Festival  When Beauteous  Artemisa  stood to view  Behind the Covert of a Golden Lattice  When King and Court returning from the Temple  When just as by her stand  Arsaces  past  The Windows by design or chance fell down  And to his view expos'd her blushing Beauties  She seem'd surpriz'd and presently withdrew  But ev'n that moment was an age in Love  So was the Monarchs heart for passion moulded  So apt to take at first the soft impression  Soon as we were alone I found the Evil  Already past a Remedy and vainly  Urg'd the resentment of her injur'd Lord  His Love was deaf to all  Mag  Was  Tiribasus  absent  Mir  He was then General of the Horse  Under old  Memnon  in the  Median  War  But if that distant view so much had charm'd him  Imagine how he burnt when by my means  He view'd her Beauties nearer when each action  And every graceful sound conspir'd to charm him  Joy of her Conquest and the hopes of Greatness  Gave Lustre to her Charms and made her seem  Of more than mortal Excellence In short  After some faint resistance like a Bride  That strives a while tho eager for the bliss  The furious King Enjoy'd her  And to secure their Joys a snare was laid  For her unthinking Lord in which he fell  Before the fame of this could reach his Ears  Since that she still has by successful Arts  Maintain'd that power which first her beauty gain'd  Mag  With deepest foresight wisely has she laid  A sure foundation of the future greatness  Of  Artaban  her only darling Son  Each busie thought that rouls within her breast  Labours for him the King when first he sicken'd  Declar'd he should succeed him in the Throne  Mir  That was a point well gain'd nor were the Eldership  Of  Artaxerxes  worth our least of fears  If  Memnon  's interest did not prop his Cause  Since then they stand secur'd by being joyn'd  From reach of open force it were a Masterpiece  Worthy a thinking head to sow division  And seeds of jealousie to lose those bonds  Which knit and hold 'em up that so divided  With ease they might be ruin'd  Mag  That's a difficulty next to impossible  Mir  Cease to think so  The wise and active conquer difficulties  By daring to attempt 'em sloth and folly  Shiver and shrink at sight of toil and hazard  And make th' impossibility they fear  Ev'n  Memnon  's temper seems to give th' occasion  Of wrong impatient headlong to revenge  Tho bold yet wants that faculty of thinking  That should direct his anger Valiant fools  Were made by Nature for the wise to work with  They are their tools and 'tis the sport of Statesmen  When Heroes knock their knotty heads together  And fall by one another  Mag  What you've said  Has wak'd a thought in me which may be lucky  Ere he was banisht for your Brothers murder  There was a friendship 'twixt us and tho then  I left his barren soil to root my self  More safely under your auspicious shade  Yet still pretending tyes of ancient Love  At his arrival here I'll visit him  Whence this advantage may at least be made  To ford his shallow Soul  Mirz  Oh much much more  'Twas happily remembred nothing gulls  These open unsuspecting fools like friendship  Dull heavy things whom Nature has left honest  In meer frugality to save the Charge  She's at in setting out a thinking Soul  Who since their own short understandings reach  No farther than the present think ev'n the wise  Like them disclose the secrets of their breasts  Speak what they think and tell tales of themselves  Thy function too will varnish o're our arts  And sanctifie dissembling  Mag  Yet still I doubt  His caution may draw back and fear a snare  Mirz  Tell him the better to assist the fraud  That ev'n I wish his friendship and would gladly  Forget that cause of hate which long has held us  At mortal distance give up my revenge  A grateful Offering to the publick peace  Mag  Could you afford him such a bribe as that  A Brothers blood yet unatton'd  Mirz  No  Magas  It is not in the power of fate to raze  That thought from out my memory  Eternal night 'tis true may cast a shade  On all my faculties extinguish knowledge  And great Revenge may with my Being cease  But while I am that ever will remain  And in my latest Spirits still survive  Yet I would have thee promise that and more  The friendship of the Queen the restitution  Of his Command and Honours that his Daughter  Shall be the Bride of  Artaban  say any thing  Thou knowst the Faith of Courtiers and their Oaths  Like those of Lovers the Gods laugh at 'em  Mag  Doubt not my zeal to serve our Royal Mistress  And in her Interest yours my Friend and Patron  Mirz  My worthy Priest still be my friend and share  The utmost of my power by greatness rais'd  Embracing  Thou like the God thou serv'st shall shine aloft  And with thy influence rule the under world  But see the Queen appears she seems to muse  Her thoughtful Soul labours with some event  Of high import which bustles like an Embryo  In its dark room and longs to be disclos'd  Retire lest we disturb her  They retire to the side of the Stage  Enter the Queen attended  Qu  Be fixt my Soul fixt on thy own firm basis  Be constant to thy self nor know the weakness  The poor Irresolution of my Sex  Disdain those shews of danger that would bar  My way to glory Ye Diviner Pow'rs  By whom 'tis said we are from whose bright Beings  Those active sparks were struck which move our clay  I feel and I Confess the Etherial energy  That busie restless principle whose appetite  Is only pleas'd with greatness like your own  Why have you clogg'd it then with dull mass  And shut it up in Woman Why debas'd it  To an Inferiour part of the Creation  Since your own heavenly hands mistook my lot  'Tis you have err'd not I Could Fate e're mean  Me for a Wife a Slave to  Tiribasus  To such a thing as he a Wretch a Husband  Therefore in just assertion of my self  I shook him off and past those narrow limits  Which Laws contrive in vain for Souls born great  There is not must not be a bound for greatness  Power gives a sanction and makes all things just  Ha  Mirza  Worthy Lord I saw thee not  Seeing  Mirza  So busie were my faculties in thought  Mir  The thoughts of Princes dwell in sacred privacy  Unknown and venerable to the vulgar  Bowing  And like a Temples innermost recesses  None enters to behold the hallow'd mysteries  Unbidden of the God that dwells within  Qu  Wise  Mirza  were my Soul a Temple fit  For Gods and Godlike Counsels to inhabit  Thee only would I choose of all mankind  To be the Priest still favour'd with access  Whose piercing Wit sway'd by unerring Judgment  Might mingle ev'n with assembled Gods  When they devise unchangeable decrees  And call 'em Fate  Mirz  Whate're I am each faculty  The utmost power of my Exerted Soul  Preserves a being only for your service  And when I am not yours I am no more  Qu  Time shall not know an end of my acknowledgments  But every day of our continu'd lives  Be witness of my gratitude to draw  The knot which holds our Common Interest closer  Within six days my Son my  Artaban  Equally dear to me as life and glory  In publick shall Espouse the fair  Cleone  And be my pledge of Everlasting Amity  Mir  O Royal Lady you outbid my service  And all returns are vile but words the poorest  Qu  Enough be as thou hast been still my friend  I ask no more But I observe of late  Your Daughter grows a stranger to the Court  Know you the cause  Mirz  A melancholy Girl  Such in her Infancy her Temper was  Soft ev'n beyond her Sexes tenderness  By nature pitiful and apt to grieve  For the mishaps of others and so make  The sorrows of the wretched world her own  Her Closet and the Gods share all her time  Except when only by some Maid attended  She seeks some shady solitary Grove  Or by the gentle murmur of some Brook  Sits sadly listning to a tale of sorrow  Till with her tears she swell the narrow stream  Qu  It is not well these thoughts must be remov'd  That eating Canker Grief with wasteful spight  Preys on the Rosie bloom of Youth and Beauty  But Love shall chace away these clouds of sadness  My Son shall breathe so warm a gale of sighs  As shall dissolve those Isicles that hang  Like death about her heart  Attend us holy  Magus  to the King  Nor cease to importune the mighty Gods  To grant him health tho much I fear in vain  Exit Queen  Magas  and Attendants  Manet  Mirza  Mirz  This meddling Priest longs to be found a fool  Thinks he that  Memnon  Souldier as he is  Thoughtless and dull will listen to his soothing  Howe're I gave his wise proposal way  Nay urg'd him to go on the shallow fraud  Will ruine him for ever with my Enemies  And make him firmly mine spight of his fears  And natural inconstancy  While Choice remains he will be still unsteady  And nothing but necessity can fix him  Exit  Enter  Artaxerxes    Memnon  and Attendants  Artax  Methinks my noble Father and my Friend  We enter here like strangers and unlookt for  Each busie face we meet with wonder starts  And seems amaz'd to see us  Mem  Well may th' ignoble herd  Start if with heedless steps they unawares  Tread on the Lyons walk a Prince's genius  Awes with supiner greatness all beneath him  With wonder they behold the great  Arsaces  Reviv'd again in Godlike  Artaxerxes  In you they see him such as oft they did  Returning from his Wars and Crown'd with Conquest  When all our Virgins met him on the way  And with their Songs and Dances blest his Triumph  Now basely aw'd by factious Priests and Women  They start at Majesty and seem surpriz'd  As if a God had met 'em In Honours name  Why have we let this be Why have we languisht  And suffer'd such a Government as this  To waste our strength and wear our Empire low  Art  Curst be the means by which these ills arose  Fatal alike to me as to my Country  Which my great Soul unable to revenge  Has yet with indignation only seen  Cut off by Arts of Coward Priests and Statesmen  Whom I disdain'd with servile smiles to court  From the great right which God and Nature gave  My birthright to a Throne  Mem  Nor Priests nor Statesmen  Could have compleated such an ill as that  If Woman had not mingled in the mischief  If  Artimesa  had not by her Charms  And all her Sex's Cunning wrought the King  Old obvious to her arts decay'd in greatness  Dead to the memory of what once he was  Just crawling on the verge of wretched life  A burthen to himself and his friends pity  Among his other failings to forget  All that a Father and a King could owe  To such a Son as you were to cut you off  From your Succession from your hopes of Empire  And graft her upstart offspring on to Royalty  Artax  But if I beat it  Oh may I live to be my Brothers Slave  The scorn of those brave Friends that own my Cause  May you my Father spurn me for a Coward  May all my noble hopes of Love and Glory  Leave me to vile despair By heaven my heart  Sits lighter in my bosome when I think  That I this day shall meet the Boy my Brother  Whose young Ambition with aspiring wings  Dares ev'n to mate my greatness  Mem  Fame that speaks  Minutely every circumstance of Princes  Describes him bold and fiercely fond of power  Which ev'n in spight of Nature he affects  Impatient of Command and hardly daigning  To be controll'd by his Imperious Mother  'Tis said too as no means were left untry'd  Which might prepare and fit him to contend  With a superiour right of birth and merit  That Books and the politer Arts which those  Who know admire have been his care already  He mingles in their Councils and they trust  His youth with secrets of important villany  The Crowd taught by his Creatures to admire him  Stile him a God in Wisdom  Artax  Be that his glory  Let him with Pedants hunt for praise in Books  Pore out his Life amongst the lazy Gownmen  Grow old and vainly proud in fancy'd knowledge  Unequal to the task of vast Ambition  Ambition the desire of active Souls  That pushes 'em beyond the bounds of Nature  And elevates the Hero to the Gods  But see my Love your beauteous Daughter comes  And ev'n Ambition ckens at her sight  Enter  Amestris  attended  Revenge and fierce desires of Glory cease  To urge my passions master'd by her eyes  And only gentle fires now warm my breast  Amest  I come my Father to attend your order  To  Memnon  Mem  'Tis well and I would have thee still be near me  The malice of the Faction which I hate  Would vent it self even on thy Innocence  Wert thou not safe under a Fathers Care  Art  Oh say a Lover's too nor can you have  An Interest in her safety more than mine  Love gives a Right superiour ev'n to Nature  Or Love is Nature in the noblest meaning  The cause and the preserver of the world  These arms that long to press thee to my bosome  For ever shall defend thee  Mem  Therefore my Son  Unto your Care I leave our common charge  Tigranes  with our friends expects my orders  Those when I have dispatcht upon the instant  I will return and meet at your apartment  Exit  Memnon  Art  Come to my arms and let me hide thee there  From all those fears that vex thy beating heart  Be safe and free from all those fancy'd dangers  That haunt thy Apprehension  Ames  Can you blame me  If from retirement drawn and pleasing solitude  I fear to tempt this Stormy Sea the World  Whose every Beach is strew'd with wrecks of wretches  That daily perish in it Curst Ambition  Why dost thou come to trouble my repose  Who have even from my Infancy disclaim'd thee  Art  Cease to complain my Love and let no thought  But what brings peace and joy approach thy breast  Let me impart my manly fires to thee  To warm thy fancy to a taste ofglory  Imperial power and Purple greatness wait thee  And sue for thy acceptance by the Sun  And by  Arsaces  Head I will not mount  The Throne of  Cyrus  but to share it with thee  Ames  Vain shews of happiness deceitful pageantry  Ah Prince hadst thou but known the joys which dwell  With humbler fortunes thou wouldst Curse thy Royalty  Had fate alotted us some obscure Village  Where only blest with life's necessities  We might have pass'd in peace our happy days  Free from the Cares which Crowns and Empires bring  There no Stepmother no Ambitious Brother  No wicked Statesmen would with Impious Arts  Have strove to wrest from us our small Inheritance  Or stir the simple Hinds to noisie faction  Our nights had all been blest with balmy slumbers  And all our waking hours been crown'd with Love  Art  Exquisite Charmer now by  Orosmades  I swear thy each soft accent melts my Soul  The joy of Conquest and Immortal Triumph  Honour and Greatness all that fires the Hero  To high Exploits and Everlasting Fame  Grows vile in sight of thee My haughty Soul  By Nature fierce and panting after glory  Could be content to live obscure with thee  Forgotten and unknown of all but my  Amestris  Ames  No Son of great  Arsaces  though my Soul  Shares in my Sexes weakness and would fly  From noise and faction and from fatal greatness  Yet for thy sake thou Idol of my heart  Nor will I blush to own the sacred flame  Thy sighs and vows have kindled in my breast  For thy lov'd sake spight of my boding fears  I'll meet the danger which Ambition brings  And tread one path with thee Nor shalt thou lose  The glorious portion which thy fate designs thee  For thy  Amestris  fears  Art  Give me those fears  For all things will be well  Ames  Grant it ye powers  This day before your Altars will I kneel  Where all my Vows shall for my Prince be offer'd  Still let success attend him Let mankind  Adore in him your visible divinity  Nor will I importune you for my self  But summ up all I ask in  Artaxerxes  Art  And doubt not but the Gods will kindly hear  Their Virgin Votary and grant her Pray'r  Our glorious Sun the source of light and heat  Whose influence chears the world he did create  Shall smile on thee from his Meridian Skies  And own the kindred Beauties of thy Eyes  Thy Eyes which could his own fair beams decay  Might shine for him and bless the world with day  Exeunt  ACT II  SCENE I An Apartment in the Palace  Enter  Memnon  and  Magas  Mem  THose who are wise in Courts my holy Sir  Make friendships with the Ministers of State  Nor seek the ruines of a wretched Exile  Lest there should be Contagion in misfortunes  And make the alliance fatal  Mag  Friends like  Memnon  Are worth being sought in danger since this age  Of most flagitious note degenerates  From the fam'd vertue of our Ancestors  And leaves but few Examples of their Excellence  Whom should we seek for friendships but those few  Those happy few within whose breasts alone  The footsteps of lost vertue yet remain  Mem  I prithee peace for nothing misbecomes  The man that would be thought a friend like flattery  Flattery the meanest kind of base dissembling  And only us'd to catch the grossest fools  Besides it stains the honour of thy function  Which like the Gods thou servst should be sincere  Mag  By that sincerity by all the service  My friendship can express I would approve it  And tho I went not from  Persepolis  Companion of your exile yet my Heart  Was with you still and what I could I did  Beseeching every God for your return  Nor were those Vows in vain since once again  'Tis given me to behold my friend nay more  Would you agree to keep you here for ever  Mem  The Gods 'tis true are just and have I hope  At length decreed an end of my misfortunes  At least they give me this to dye with honour  When Life grows vile or burthensome  Mag  By me they offer all that you can ask  And point an easie way to happiness  Spare then the Wounds our wretched Country fears  The thousand ills which Civil discord brings  Oh still that noise of war whose dread alarms  Frightens repose from Country Villages  And stirs rude tumult up and wild distraction  In all our peaceful Cities  Mem  Witness for me  Ye awful Gods who view our inmost thoughts  I took not arms till urg'd by self defence  The eldest law of Nature  Impute not then those ills which may insue  To me but those who with incessant hate  Pursue my life whose malice spreads the flame  To every part that my devoted fabrick  May in the universal ruine burn  Mag  And yet ev'n there perhaps you judge too rashly  Impetuous passion hurries you so fast  You cannot mark the advantage of your fortune  Mem  Has not the Law been urg'd to set a brand  Of foul dishonour on my hoary head  Ha am I not proscrib'd  Mag  Forget that thought  That jarring grates your Soul and turns the harmony  Of blessed peace to curst infernal discord  Hate and its fatal causes all shall cease  And  Memnon  's name be honour'd as of old  The bravest and the most successful warrior  The fortunate defender of his Country  Mem  'Tis true nor will it seem a boast to own  I have fought well for  Persia  and repay'd  The benefit of birth with honest service  Full fifty years harnest in rugged Steel  I have endur'd the biting Winters blast  And the severer heats of parching Summer  While they who loll'd at home on lazy Couches  Amidst a Crew of Harlots and soft Eunuchs  Were at my cost secure in luxury  This is a Justice  Mirza  's self must do me  Mag  Even he tho fatal accidents have set  A most unhappy bar between your friendship  Lamenting that there had been cause of Enmity  And owning all the merit of your virtues  Will often wish Fate had ordain d you friends  Mem  Our God the Sun shall sooner change his Course  And all the impossibilities which Poets  Count to extravagance of loose discription  Shall sooner be  Mag  Yet hear me noble  Memnon  When by the duty of my Priesthood mov'd  And in just detestation of the mischiefs  Intestine jars produce I urg'd wise  Mirza  By his Concurrence Help and healing Counsels  To stop those wounds at which his Country bleeds  Griev'd at the thought he vow d his whole endeavour  Should be to close those breaches  That even  Cleander  's death and all those Quarrels  That long have nourisht hatred in your Houses  Should be in joy of publick Peace forgotten  Mem  Oh couldst thou charm the malice of a Statesman  And make him quit his purpose of Revenge  Thy preaching might reform the guilty world  And Vice would be no more  Mag  Nay ev'n the Queen  Will bind the Confirmation by her Son  And asks the fair  Amestris  for Prince  Artaban  Mem  Were that the only terms it were impossible  Mag  You would not shun th' alliance of a Prince  Mem  No for it is the glory of my fate  That  Artaxerxes  is design'd my Son  With every Grace and Royal Vertue crown'd  Great just and merciful such as mankind  When in the infant world first governments  Began by chance would have design'd a King  Mag  Unbounded power and height of greatness give  To Kings that lustre which we think divine  The wise who know 'em know they are but men  Nay sometimes weak ones too the Crowd indeed  Who kneel before the Image not the God  Worship the Deity their hands have made  The Name of  Artaban  will be as great  As that of  Cyrus  when he shall possess  As sure he shall his Throne  Mem  Ha what means he  This Villain Priest but hold my rage a little  And learn dissimulation I'll try him farther  aside  You talk in Riddles when you name a Throne  And  Artaban  the Gods who portion out  The Lots of Princes as of private men  Have put a bar between his hopes and Empire  Mag  What bar  Mem  The best an Elder Brothers Claim  Mag  That's easily remov'd the King their Father  On just and weighty reasons has decreed  His Scepter to the younger add to this  The joint Concurrence of our  Persian  Lords  Who only want your voice to make it firm  Mem  Can I Can they Can any honest hand  Join in an act like this is not the Elder  By nature pointed out for preference  Is not his right inroll'd amongst those Laws  Which keep the world's vast frame in beauteous order  Ask those thou namest but now what made them Lords  What titles had they had if merit only  Could have conferr'd a right if Nature had not  Strove hard to thrust the worst deserving first  And stampt the Noble mark of Eldership  Upon their baser mettal  Mag  Sure there may be  Reasons of so much power and cogent force  As may even set aside this right of Birth  If Sons have rights yet Fathers have 'em too  'Twere an Invidious task to enter into  The Insolence and other faults which mov'd  Royal  Arsaces  to a just displeasure  Against his Eldest Son Prince  Artaxerxes  Mem  Ha dare not for thy life I charge dare not  To brand the spotless virtue of my Prince  With falshoods of most base and damn'd contrivance  I tell thee envious Priest should the just Gods  Require severe account of thy past life  And charge remembrance to dispose thy Crimes  In rank and hideous order to thy view  Horror and guilt of Soul would make thee mad  Mag  You take the matter farther than I meant it  My friendship only aims at your advantage  Would point you out a way to Peace and Honour  And in return of this your rage unkindly  Loads me with Injuries  Mem  Away I cannot bear thy base dissembling  My honest Soul disdains thee and thy friendship  How hast thou dar'd to think so vilely of me  That I would condescend to thy mean arts  And traffick with thee for a Princes ruin  A Prince the Joy and Honour of Mankind  As much superiour to the rest of Kings  As they themselves are above common men  And is the very Image of the Gods  Wer't thou not priviledg'd like age and women  My Sword should reach thee and revenge the wrong  Thy Tongue has done his fame  Mag  Ungrateful Lord  Would'st thou invade my life as a return  For proffer'd Love But let th' event declare  How great a good by me sincerely offer'd  Thy dull Romantick honour has refus'd  And since I have discharg'd the debt I ow'd  To former friendship if the Gods hereafter  Send Ruin down and plague thee with Confusion  Remember me in vain and Curse thy folly  Exit  Magas  Mem  No my remembrance treasures honest thoughts  And holds not things like thee I scorn thy friendship  And would not owe my life to such a Villain  But thou art hardly Saint enough to prophecy  Were all thy Tribe like thee it might well startle  Our Lay unlearned faith when thro such hands  The knowledge of the Gods is reach'd to man  But thus those Gods instruct us that not all  Who like intruders thrust into their service  And turn the Holy Office to a trade  Participate their sacred influence  This then is your own Cause ye awful powers  Revenge your selves your violated Altars  That those who with unhallow'd hands approach  May tremble at your justice  Exit  Memnon  SCENE II The Palace  Enter the Queen  Artaban    Mirza    Magas  and Attendants  Artab  My Brother then is come  Mirz  My Lord I saw him  With him old haughty  Memnon  as they past  With fierce disdain they view'd the gazing Crowd  And with dumb Pride seem'd to neglect that worship  Which yet they wisht to sind this way they move  'Tis said to ask an Audience of the King  Qu  Mirza  'tis well I thank thy timely care  Here will we face this storm of insolence  Nor fear the noisy thunder let it rowl  Then burst and spend at once its idle rage  Artab  Why meet we thus like wrangling Advocates  To urge the justice of our Cause with words  I hate this parle 'tis tame if we must meet  Give me my Arms and let us stake at once  Our rights of Merit and of Eldership  And prove like Men our title  Mirz  'Twere unsafe  They come surrounded by a croud of friends  To strike thro these were dangerous and rash  Fate waits for 'em elsewhere with certain ruine  From  Mirza  's hand expect it  Qu  Be it so  Auspicions Sage I trust thee with my fortune  My hopes of greatness do thou guide 'em all  For me and for thy self My Son give way  Nor let thy hasty youth disturb with outrage  The present necessary face of peace  Occasions great and glorious will remain  Worthy thy Arms and Courage  Artab  I obey  And willingly resign th' unmanly task  Words are indeed your province  Mirz  My Royal Mistress  Prepare to meet with more than brutal fury  From the fierce Prince and  Memnon  Qu  Well I know  The Insolence and native Pride of each  With scurril taunts and blackest infamy  They load my name But let the wretches rail  A woman's vengeance waits 'em  Mirz  They are here  Enter  Artaxerxes    Memnon  and Attendants  Artax  Ye tutelar Gods who guard this Royal fabrick  And thou O  Orosmades  the Protector  Of the great  Persian  race E're yet my Father  Royal  Arsaces  mingle with your God heads  Grant me once more to lay before his feet  His eldestborn his once lov'd  Artaxerxes  To offer my Obedience to his Age  All that a Son can owe to such a Father  You who with haggard eyes stare wildly on me  If as by your attendance here you seem  You serve the King my Father lead me to him  Qu  And dost thou wonder that mankind should start  When Parricides and Rebels in despight  Of Nature Majesty and Reverend Age  With Impious force and Ruffian violence  Would rob a King and Father of his life  Cut off his short remains  Artax  Ha sayst thou woman  I prethee peace and urge not a reply  I would not hold acquaintance with thy Infamy  Qu  Ye Righteous powers whose justice awes the world  Let not your Thunders sleep when Crimes like these  Stalk in the open air  Artax  Thy Priest instructs thee  Else sure thou hadst not dar'd to tempt the Gods  And trifle with their Justice Canst thou name it  And look on me on me whom thy Curst arts  Have strove to bar from native Right to Empire  Made me a stranger to a Fathers Love  And broke the bands of Nature which once held me  The nea rest to his heart  Qu  Had he not reason  When thou with Rebel Insolence didst dare  To own and to protect that hoary Ruffian  Pointing to  Memnon  And in dispight ev'n of thy Fathers justice  To stir the factious Rabble up to arms  For him and make a murderer's cause thy own  Mem  I had another name nor shouldst thou move me  Insulting Queen to words did not remembrance  With horror sting my Soul for  Tiribasus  Thy murder'd  Tiribasus  when by my fatal orders  And by his own high Courage urg'd he fell  To make thy way to guilty greatness easie  I thought him then a Traytor for thy arts  Had taught the Royal Mandate so to call him  Too big for publick Justice and on that pretence  Consented to the snare that catcht his life  So my obedient honesty was made  The Pandar to thy Lust and black Ambition  Except the guilt of that accursed day  In all my Iron years of wars and danger  From blooming youth down to decaying age  My fame ne're knew a stain of foul dishonour  And if that make me guilty think what thou art  The Cause and the Contriver of that mischief  Qu  What namest thou  Tiribasus  be his guilt  Forgotten with his memory Think on  Cleander  And let the Furies that enquire for blood  Stir horror up and bitterest remorse  To gnaw thy anxiou Soul Oh great  Cleande  Unworthy was thy fate thou first of Warriors  To fall beneath a base Assassin's stab  Whom all the thirsty instruments of death  Had in the field of Battel sought in vain  Mem  In sight of Heaven and of the equal Gods  I will avow that my Revenge was just  My injur'd honour could not ask for less  Since he refus'd to do a Souldiers Justice  I us'd him as I ought  Qu  Amazing boldness  And dare'st thou call that act a Souldiers Justice  Didst thou not meet him with dissembled Friendship  Hiding the rancour of thy heart in smiles  When he whose open unsuspecting nature  Thought thee a Souldier honest as himself  Came to the Banquet as secure of peace  By mutual vows renew'd and in the revel  Of that luxurious day forgetting hate  And every cause of ancient animosity  Devoted all his thoughts to mirth and friendship  Then  Memnon  at an hour when few are Villains  The sprightly juice infusing gentler thoughts  And kindling love ev'n in the coldest breasts  Unequal to him in the face of War  Stole on  Cleander  with a Cowards malice  And struck him to the heart  Mem  By the stern God  By  Mars  the Patron of my honour'd Wars  'Tis basely false In his own drunken brawl  The boaster fell I bore his lavish tongue  Nor thought him worth my Sword till his cold temper  Warm'd with the Wine he dar'd me to the Combat  Then pleas'd to meet him in that fit of Valour  I took him at his word and with my Sword  Drawn against his in equal opposition  I kill'd him while it lasted  Artax  Cease we my friend  This womens war of railing when they talk  Men should be still and let noise tire it self  I came to find a Father tho my fears  Suggest the worst of evils to my thoughts  And make me dread to hear  Arsaces  fate  Lead  Memnon  to the Presence  Qu  Prince you pass not  Guards keep the door the King your Father lives  Artax  Haif he lives why lives he not to me  Why am I thus shut out and banisht from him  Why are my veins rich with his Royal blood  Why did he give me Life if not to serve him  Forbid me not to wait upon his Bed  And watch his sickly slumbers that my youth  May with its service glad his drooping age  And his cold hand may bless me e're he dye  Nay be a Queen and rob me of his Crown  But let me keep my right to filial piety  Qu  Well hast thou urg'd the specious name of Duty  To hide deform d Rebellion Hast thou not  With thy false arts poyson'd his peoples Loyalty  What meant thy pompous progress thro the Empire  Thy vast profusion to the factious Nobles  Whose interest sways the Croud and stirs up Mutiny  Why did thy haughty fierce disdainful Soul  Stoop to the meanest arts which catch the vulgar  Herd with 'em fawn upon 'em and caress 'em  Appeal to them to them relate thy wrongs  And make them Judges of thy Fathers Justice  Thy cruel and unnatural lust of power  Have sunk thy Father more than all his years  And made him wither in a green old age  Artax  False all as hell Nor had I arm'd my friends  But to defend that right  Qu  Dost thou not come  Impatient of delay to hasten fate  To bring that death the lingering disease  Would only for a day or two defer  Artax  Thear thee and disdain thy little malice  That dares to stain my virtue with a Crime  It views with most abhorrence but reproach  Is lost on thee since Modesty with all  The Vertues that adorn thy Sex is fled  Qu  Audacious Rebel  Artax  Infamous Adultress  Stain of my Fathers Bed and of his Throne  Artab  Villain thou ly'st oh Madam give me way  To the Queen who holds him drawing his Sword  Whatever bars my fury calls me base  Unworthy of the honor of your Son  Qu  Hold  Artaban  my honour suffers not  From his lewd breath nor shall thy Sword prophane  With brawls or blood the reverence of this place  To peace and sacred Majesty devoted  Artax  Ha who art thou  To  Artaban  Artab  The son of great  Arsaces  Artax  No 'tis false thy forging mother's damn'd contrivance  Seek for thy Father in that plotting fellow  The Hero's race disclaims thee Why dost thou frown  And knit thy boyish brow Dost thou dare ought  Worthy the rank of the Divine  Arsacides  If so come forth break from that womans arms  And meet me with thy good Sword like a man  Artab  Yes  Artaxerxes  yes thou shalt be met  The mighty Gods have held us in the balance  And one of us is doom'd to sink for ever  Nor can I bear a long delay of Fate  But wish the great decision were ev'n now  Proud and ambitious Prince I dare like thee  All that is great and glorious Like thine  Immortal thirst of Empire fires my soul  My soul which of superiour power impatient  Disdains thy Eldership therefore in Arms  Which give the noblest right to Kings I will  To death dispute with thee the Throne of  Cyrus  Artax  Do this and thou art worthy of my anger  O energy divine of great Ambition  That can inform the souls of beardless Boys  And ripen 'em to Men in spight of Nature  I tell thee Boy that Empire is a Cause  or which the Gods might wage Immortal War  en let my soul exert her utmost vertue  And think at least thou art  Arsaces  Son  That the Idea o' thy fancy'd Father  ay raise and animate thy le  er Genius  And make thee fit to meet my arm in Battel  Artab  Oh doubt not but my soul is charm'd with greatness  So much it rivals even the joy of Knowledge  And Sacred Wisdom What makes Gods divine  But Power and Science infinite  Hear only this our Father prest by age  And a long train of Evils which that brings  Languishes in the last Extremes of life  Since thou wouldst blot my birth with base dishonour  Be this my proof of filial piety  While yet he lives cease we our enmity  Nor let the hideous noise of War disturb  His parting

to Empire  Exeunt severally Queen and  Artaban    Artaxerxes    Memn  cum suis  Manent  Mirza  and  Magas  Mirz  Most fortunate Event which gives us more  Than even our wishes could have askt This Truce  Gives lucky opportunity for thinking  'Twill lull these thoughtless Heroes to security  Mag  Th' approaching Festival will more confirm it  Of all those sacred times which heretofore  Religion has distinguisht from the rest  And to the service of the Gods devoted  This has been still most venerable held  Among the vulgar toil and labour ceases  With Chaplets crown'd they dance to the shrill Pipe  And in their Songs invoke those milder Deities  That soften anxious life with peace and pleasure  Slaves are enfranchis'd and inveterate foes  Forget or at the least suspend their hate  And meet like friends Pernicious discord seems  Out rooted from our more than Iron age  The Gods are worshipt with unusual Reverence  Since none not ev'n our Kings approach their Temples  With any mark of Wars destructive Rage  But Sacrifice unarm'd  Mirz  A lucky thought  Is in my mind at once compleatly form'd  Like  Grecian Pallas  in the head of  Jove  When  Memnon Artaxerxes  and their friends  Shall in obedience to the Holy Rites  To morrow at the Altar bow unarm'd  Orchanes  with a party of the Guards  Who in my Palace shall this night be plac'd  May at that private door which opens into  The Temple rush at once and seize 'em all  The heads once safe the mean and heartless Crowd  With ease may be disperst  Mag  What you propose  Wears a successful face were it as innocent  An act of such outrageous prophanation  May shock the thoughts ev'n of our closest friends  And make 'em start from an abhorr'd alliance  That draws the vengeance of the Gods upon 'em  Mirz  Art thou the first to start a doubt like that  Art thou who dost inspire their Oracles  And teach 'em to deceive the easie Crowd  In doubtful phrase afraid of thy own Gods  In every change they were on thy side still  And sure they will not leave thee now for trifles  The Gods shall certainly befriend our Cause  At least not be our foes nor will they leave  Their happy seats where free from care and pain  Blest in themselves alone of man regardless  They loll serene in Everlasting Ease  To mind the trivial business of our world  Mag  But more I fear the Superstitious Vulgar  Who tho unknowing what Religion means  Yet nothing moves 'em more than zealous rage  For its defence when they believe it violated  Mirz  I was to blame to tax the Priest with scruples  Or think his care of Interest was his Conscience  Aside  My Caution shall obviate all thy fears  We will give out that they themselves design'd  To fire the Temple and then kill the King  No matter tho it seem not very probable  More monstrous tales have oft amus'd the vulgar  Mag  I yield to your direction and to strengthen  The Enterprize will secretly dispose  A party of my own within the Temple  To joyn with yours  Mirz  It joys my heart to think  That I shall glut my vengeance on this  Memnon  That I shall see him strive in vain and Curse  The happy fraud that caught him Like a Lyon  Who long has reign'd the terror of the Woods  And dar'd the boldest Huntsman to the Combat  Till catcht at length within some hidden snare  With soaming Jaws he bites the Toils that hold him  And roars and rowls his fiery eyes in vain  While the surrounding Swains at pleasure wound him  And make his death their sport  Thus Wit still gets the mastery o're Courage  Long time unmatcht in War the Hero shone  And mighty Fame in fields of Battel won  Till one fine project of the Statesman's Brain  Exeunt  Bereaves him of the spoyls his Arms did gain  Exeunt  And renders all his boasted prowess vain  Exeunt  ACT III  SCENE I A Garden belonging to  Mirza  's Palace  Cleone  is discover'd lying on a bank of Flowers attending  SONG  by  B Stote    Esq  UPon a shady Bank repos'd  Philanthe  amorous young and fair  Sighing to the Groves disclos'd  The story of her Care  The Vocal Groves give some relief  While they her notes return  The Waters murmur o're her grief  And  seems to mourn  A Swain that heard the Nymph complain  In pity of the fair  Thus kindly strove to Cure her pain  And Ease her mind of Care  Tis just that Love should give you rest  From Love your Torments came  Take that warm Cordial to your breast  And meet a kinder flame  How wretched must the woman prove  Beware fair Nymph beware  Whose folly scorns anothers Love  And Courts her own Despair  Cleo  Oh Love thou bane of an unhappy Maid  Still art thou busie at my panting heart  Still dost thou melt my Soul with thy soft Images  And make my ruine pleasing fondly I try  By gales of Sighs and Floods of streaming Tears  To vent my sorrows and asswage my passions  Still fresh supplies renew th' exhausted stores  Love reigns my Tyrant to himself alone  He vindicates the Empire of my breast  And banishes all thoughts of joy for ever  Bel  Why are you still thus Cruel to your self  Why do you feed and cherish the disease  That preys on your dear life how can you hope  To find a Cure for Love in solitude  Why rather chuse you not to shine at Court  And in a thousand gay diversions there  To lose the memory of this wretched passion  Cleo  Alas  Beliza  thou hast never known  The fatal power of a resistless Love  Like that avenging guilt that haunts the Impious  In vain we hope by flying to avoid it  In Courts and Temples it pursues us still  And in the loudest clamours will be heard  It grows a part of us lives in our blood  And every beating pulse proclaims its force  Oh think not then that I can shun my self  The Grave can only hide me from my sorrows  Bel  Allow me then at least to share your griefs  Companions in misfortunes make 'em less  And I could suffer much to make you easie  Cleo  Sit by me gentle Maid and while I tell  A wretched tale of unregarded Love  If thou in kind compassion of my woes  Shalt sigh or shed a tear for my mishap  My grateful eyes shall pay it back with interest  Help me to rail at my too easie heart  That rashly entertain'd this fatal guest  And you my eyes why were you still impatient  Of any other sight but  Artaxerxes  Why did you make my womans heart acquainted  With all the thousand graces and perfections  That dress the lovely Hero up for Conquest  Bel  Had you oppos'd this passion in its infancy  E're time had given it strength it might have dy'd  Cleo  That was the fatal Error that undid me  My Virgin thoughts and unexperienc'd Innocence  Found not the danger till it was too late  And tho when first I saw the charming Prince  I felt a pleasing motion at my heart  Short breathing sighs heav'd in my panting breast  The mounting blood flusht in my glowing face  And dy'd my cheeks with more than usual blushes  I thought him sure the wonder of his kind  And wisht my fate had given me such a Brother  Yet knew not that I lov'd but thought that all  Like me beheld and blest him for his Excellence  Bel  Sure never hopeless Maid was curst before  With such a wretched passion all the Gods  Join to oppose your happiness 'tis said  This day the Prince shall wed the fair  Amestris  Cleo  No my  Beliza  I have never known  The pleasing thoughts of hope certain despair  Was born at once and with my love encreas'd  Bel  Think you the Prince has e're perceiv'd your thoughts  Cleo  Forbid it all ye chaster powers that favour  The modesty and Innocence of Maids  No till my death no other breast but thine  Shall e're participate the fatal secret  O could I think that he had ever known  My hidden flame shame and confusion  Would force my Virgin soul to leave her mansion  And certain Death ensue  Thou name'st the fair  Amestris  didst thou not  Bel  Madam I did  Cleo  I envy not her happiness  Tho sure few of our Sex are blest like her  In such a Godlike Lord  Would I had been a man  With honour then I might have sought his friendship  Perhaps from long experience of my faith  He might have lov'd me better than the rest  Amidst the dangers of the horrid War  Still had I been the nearest to his side  In Courts and Triumphs still had shar'd his joys  Or when the sportful Chace had call'd us forth  Together had we cheer'd our foaming Steeds  Together prest the Savage o're the plain  And when o'relabour'd with the pleasing toil  Stretcht on the verdant soil had slept together  But whither does my roving fancy wander  These are the sick dreams of fantastick love  So in a Calenture the Seaman fancies  Green Fields and Flowry Meadows on the Ocean  Till leaping in the wretch is lost for ever  Bel  Try but the Common Remedies of Love  And let a second flame expel the first  Cleo  Impossible as well thou mayst imagine  When thou complainst of heat at scorching noon  Another Sun shall rise to shine more kindly  Believe me my  Beliza  I am grown  So fond of the delusion that has charm'd me  I hate the officious hand that offers cure  Bel  Madam Prince  Artaban  Cleo  My cruel Stars  Do ye then envy me my very solitude  But death the wretches only remedy  Shall hide me from your hated Light for ever  Enter  Artaban  Artab  Ah Lovely Mourner still still wilt thou blast  My eager Love with unauspicious Tears  When at thy Feet I kneel and sue for pity  Or justly of thy cold regards complain  Still wilt thou only answer me with sighs  Cleo  Alas my Lord what answer can I give  If still I entertain you with my grief  Pity the temper of a wretched Maid  By  sad and born the child of sorrow  In vain you ask for happiness from me  Who want it for my self  Art  Can blooming Youth  And Virgin Innocence that knows not guilt  Know any cause for grief  Cleo  Do but survey  The miserable state of humane kind  Where wretches are the general Encrease  And tell me if there be not cause for grief  Art  Such thoughts as these my fair Philosopher  Inhabit wrinkled cheeks and hollow eyes  The marks which years set on the wither'd Sage  The gentle Goddess Nature wisely has  Alotted other cares for youth and beauty  The God of Love stands ready with his Torch  To light it at thy eyes but still in vain  For e re the slame can catch 'tis drown'd in tears  Cleo  Oh name not Love the worst of all misfortunes  The common ruin of my easie Sex  Which I have sworn for ever to avoid  In memory of all those hapless Maids  That Love has plung'd in unexampled woes  Artab  For bear to argue with that Angel face  Against the passion thou wert form'd to raise  Alas thy frozen heart has only known  Love in Reverse not tasted of its joys  The wishes soft desires and pleasing pains  That centre all in most extatick bliss  Oh lovely Maid misspend no more that treasure  Of Youth and Charms which lavish Nature gives  The  Paphian  Goddess frowns at thy delay  By her fair self and by her Son she swears  Thy Beauties are devoted to her service  Now now she shoots her fires into my breast  She urges my desires and bids me seize thee  Taking her hand and kissing it  And bear thee as a Victim to her Altar  Then offer up ten thousand thousand joys  As an amends for all thy former coldness  Clev  Forbear my Lord or I must swear to fly  For ever from your sight  Artab  Why dost thou frown  And damp the rising joy within my breast  Art thou resolv'd to force thy gentle nature  Compassionate to all the World beside  And only to me cruel Shall my vows  Thy Fathers intercession all be vain  Cleo  Why do you urge my Fathers fatal power  To Curse you with a sad unlucky Bride  Cast round your eyes on our gay Eastern Courts  Where smiling Beauties born to better fates  Give joy to the beholders  There bless some happy Princess with your vows  And leave the poor  Cleone  to her sorrows  Artab  What Queens are those of most celestial form  Whose Charms can drive thy Image from my heart  Oh were they cast in Natures fairest mold  Brighter than  Cynthia  's shining train of Stars  Kind as the softest she that ever claspt  Her Lover when the Bridal night was past  I swear I would prefer thee O  Cleone  With all thy scorn and cold indifference  Would choose to languish and to dye for thee  Much rather than be blest and live for them  Cleo  Oh Prince it is too much nor am I worthy  The honour of your passion since 'tis fixt  By certain and unalterable fate  That I can never yield you a return  My thoughts are all to chaste  Diana  vow'd  And I have sworn to die her Virgin Votary  Artab  Impossible thou canst not give away  Mine and thy Fathers right ev'n to the Gods  Diana  will disown the unjust donation  Nor favour such an injury to Love  To every power divine I will appeal  Nor shall thy Beauty bribe 'em to be partial  Their Altars now expect us Come fair Saint  And if thou wilt abide their righteous doom  Their Justice must decree my happiness  Reward my sufferings and my flame approve  For they themselves have felt the pow'r of Love  Exeunt  SCENE II The Temple of the Sun  Enter  Artaxerxes    Amestris  and Attendants  Artax  'Tis done 'Tis done oh let me find some way  To tell the mighty joy that fills my breast  Lest I grow mad with height of furious bliss  The holy Priest has ty'd the sacred knot  And my  Amestris  now is all my own  Oh thou soft Charmer thou excelling Sweetness  Why art thou not transported all like me  I swear thou dost not love thy  Artaxerxes  If thou art calm in this excess of happiness  Amest  Alas my Lord my panting heart yet trembles  In vast suspence between unruly joys  And chilling fears somewhat methinks there is  That checks my soul and says I was too bold  To quit the pleasures of my Virgin state  To barter 'em for cares and anxious love  Artax  These are the fears which wait on every Bride  And only serve for preludes to her joys  Short sighs and all those motions of thy heart  Are Nature's call and kindle warm desires  Soon as the friendly Goddess of the night  Shall draw her vail of darkness o're thy blushes  These little cold unnecessary doubts  Shall fly the circle of my folding arms  And when I press thee trembling to my bosom  Thou shalt confess if there be room for words  Or ev'n for thoughts that all those thoughts are bliss  Amest  Yet surely mine are more than common fears  For oh my Prince when my foreboding heart  Surveys the uncertain state of humane joys  How secretly the malice of our fate  Unseen pursues and often blasts our happiness  In full security I justly dread  Lest death or parting or some unseen accident  Much worse if possible than each of these  Should curse us more than ever we were blest  Artax  Doubt not the Gods my Fair whose righteous power  Shall favour and protect our vertuous Loves  If still thou apprehendst approaching danger  Let us make haste and snatch th' uncertain joy  While fate is in our power  Now let us start and give a loose to Love  Feast ev'ry sence with most luxurious pleasure  mprove our minutes make 'em more than years  Than ages and ev'n live the life of Gods  f after this death or ill fortune comes  cannot injure us since we already  Have liv'd and been beforehand with our fate  Amest  Oh let me ease at once my tender heart  nd tell my dearest Lord my worst of fears  here is an ill which more than death I dread  ould you by time and long fruition sated  Grow faithless and forget the lost  Amestris  orget that Everlasting truth you vow'd  ho sure I should not publickly complain  Nor to the Gods accuse my perjur'd Prince  Yet my soft soul would sink beneath the weight  I should grow mad and curse my very being  And wish I ne're had been or not been lov'd  Artax  Dost thouwhen every happier Star shines for us  And with propitious Influence gilds our fortune  Dost thou invent fantastick forms of danger  And fright thy soul with things that are Impossible  Now by the Potent God of Love I swear  I will have ample vengeance for thy doubts  My soft complaining Fair shalt thou not pay me  In Joys too fierce for thought for these suspicions  The bands which hold our Love are knit by fate  Nor shall decaying time or nature loose 'em  Beyond the limits of the silent Grave  Love shall survive immortal as our beings  And

face  Ev'n thought is lost in exquisite delight  Artax  Oh thou delicious perfect Angel Woman  Thou art too much for mortal sence to bear  The Vernal bloom and fragrancy of Spices  Wafted by gentle winds are not like thee  From thee as from the  Cyprian  Queen of Love  Ambrosial odours flow my every faculty  Is charm'd by thee and drinks Immortal pleasure  Oh glorious God of day fly swiftly

phrase my speech in apt expression  To tell how much I love and honour you  Might I but live to fight one Battel for you  Tho with my Life I bought the Victory  Tho my old batter'd trunk were hew'd to pieces  And scatter'd o're the field yet should I bless  My fate and think my years wound up with honour  Artax  Doubt not my noble Father but even yet  A large remain of Glory is behind  When Civil

wondring shall behold us  Strict in our discipline undaunted patient  Of Wars stern toil and dread our hostile vertue  Those stubborn Commonwealths that proudly dare  Disdain the glorious Monarchs of the East  Shall pay their homage to the Throne of  Cyrus  And when with Lawrels cover'd we return  My Love shall meet and smiling bless our triumph  While at her feet I lay the Scepters of the world

lay  No sooner thou infus'd thy ray  But the dull mass its pow'r obey'd  But an harmonious  World  was made  Which still when thou withdrawst thy beams  An undistinguisht  Chaos  seems  For what are objects without sight  Or vision when involv'd in night  Night is an universal Grave  Where  things  but doubtful beings have  Till them thy beams illuminate  And as it were again create  Chorus  c  Hail source of immaterial fire  That ne're begun can ne're expire  Whose Orh with streaming Glories fraught  Dazles the ken of human thought  All the dependant Spheres above  By thy direction shine and move  All purer beings here below  From thy immediate Essence flow  What is the Soul  of man  but light  Drawn down from thy transcendent height  What but an Intellectual beam  A spark of thy immortal flame  For as thou rulest with gladsome rays  The  greater  world so this the  less  And like thy own diffusive Soul  Shoots life and vigour thro the whole  Since then from thee at first it came  To thee tho clogg d it points its flame  And conscious of superiour birth  Despises this unkindred Earth  Chorus  c  Hail  Orosmades  Pow'r Divine  Permits us to approach thy shrine  Permit thy Votartes to raise  Their grateful voices to thy praise  Thou art the Father of our Kings  The stem whence their high lineage springs  The Sov'reign Lord that does maintain  Their uncontroul'd and boundless Reign  O then assist thy drooping Son  Who long has grac't our  Persian  Throne  O may he yet extend his sway  We yet  Arsaces  Rule obey  Let thy  vitiality  impart  New Spirits to his
