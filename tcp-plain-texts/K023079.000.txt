 AN ESSAY ON MAN  AN ESSAY on MAN Being the FIRST BOOK of ETHIC EPISTLES  TO  HENRY St JOHN  L  BOLINGBROKE  ΓΝΩΘΙ ΣΕΑΥΤΟΝ  LONDON  Printed by JOHN WRIGHT for LAWTON GILLIVER MDCCXXXIV  THE DESIGN  HAVING proposed to write some Pieces on Human Life and Manners such as to use my Lord  Bacon  's expression  come home to Men's Business and Bosoms  I thought it more satisfactory to begin with considering  Man  in the Abstract his  Nature  and his  State  since to prove any moral Duty to inforce any moral Precept or to examine the Perfection or Imperfection of any Creature whatsoever it is necessary first to know what  Condition  and  Relation  it is placed in and what is the proper  End  and  Purpose  of its  Being  The Science of Human Nature is like all other Sciences reduced to a  few    clear Points  There are not many  certain Truths  in this World It is therefore in the Anatomy of the Mind as in that of the Body more Good will accrue to mankind by attending to the large open and perceptible parts than by studying too much such finer nerves and vessels as will for ever escape our observation The  Disputes  are all upon these last and I will venture  to say they have less sharpen'd the  Wits  than the  Hearts  of Men against each other and have diminished the Practise more than advanced the Theory of Morality If I could flatter my self that this Essay has any Merit it is in steering betwixt Doctrines seemingly opposite in passing over Terms utterly unintelligible and in forming out of all a  temperate  yet not  inconsistent  and a  short  yet not  imperfect  System of Ethics  This I might have done in Prose but I chose Verse and even Rhyme for two reasons The one will appear obvious that Principles Maxims or Precepts so written both strike the reader more strongly at first and are more easily retained by him afterwards The other may seem odd but is true I found I could express them more  shortly  this way than in Prose itself and nothing is more certain than that much of the  Force  as well as  Grace  of Arguments or Instructions depends on their Conciseness I was unable to treat this part of my subject more in  detail  without becoming dry and tedious or more  poetically  without sacrificing Perspicuity to Ornament without wandring from the Precision or breaking the Chain of Reasoning If any man can unite all these without diminution of any of them I freely confess he will compass a thing above my capacity  What is now published is only to be considered as a general  Map  of  MAN  marking out no more than the  Greater  Parts  their  Extent  their  Limits  and their  Connection  but leaving the Particular to be more fully delineated in the Charts which are to follow Consequently these Epistles in their progress will become less dry and more susceptible of Poetical Ornament I am here only opening the  Fountains  and clearing the passage To deduce the  Rivers  to follow them in their Course and to observe their Effects will be a task more agreeable  THE CONTENTS OF THE FIRST BOOK  EPISTLE I Of the NATURE and STATE of MAN with respect to the UNIVERSE  OF  Man  in the  Abstract  We can judge only with regard to our  own System  being ignorant of the  Relations  of Systems and Things VER c to Man is not therefore to be deem'd  Imperfect  but a Being suited to his  Place  and  Rank  in the Creation agreeable to the  General Order  of Things and conformable to  Ends  and  Relations  to him unknown c It is partly upon this  Ignorance  of future Events and partly upon the  Hope  of a Future State that all his Happiness in the present depends c His  Pride  in aiming at more  Knowledge  and pretending to more  Perfection  the cause of his Error and Misery The  Impiety  of putting himself in the  place of  God  and judging of the fitness or unfitness perfection or imperfection justice or injustice of his dispensations  to  The  Absurdity  of conceiting himself the  final cause  of the creation or expecting that Perfection in the  moral  world which is not in the  natural    to  The  Unreasonableness  of his complaints against Providence while on the one hand he demands the perfections of the Angels on the other the bodily qualifications of the Brutes That the gift of  Reason alone  countervails all the latter and that to possess any of the  sensitive faculties  in a higher degree would render him miserable  to  That throughout the whole visible world an universal  Order  and  gradation  in these is observ'd which causes a  subordination  of creature to creature and of all creatures of man The gradations of  sense instinct thought reflection reason    to  How much  farther  this order and subordination of living creatures may extend above and below us Were any  part  of this broken not that part only but the  whole  connected  Creation  must be destroyed The extravagance madness and pride of such a desire c Consequently the absolute submission due to Providence both as to our  present  and  future  state c  EPISTLE II Of the NATURE and STATE of MAN with respect to HIMSELF as an Individual  THE business of man not to pry into  God  but to study  himself  His  Middle Nature  his  powers  and  frailties  and the Limits of his  capacity  VER  to  His two Principles  Selflove  and  Reason  both necessary  Selflove  the  stronger  and why their  End  the same The  Passions  and their  Use    to  The  Predominant Passion  and its  force    to  its  necessity  in directing men to different purposes c its  providential use  in fixing our  principle  and ascertaining our  virtue    Virtue  and  Vice  join'd in our  mixt nature  the limits  near  yet the things  separate  and  evident  What is the office of  Reason  c How odious  Vice  in itself and how we deceive our selves into it That however the  Ends  of  Providence  and  general Good  are answer'd in our  Passions  and  Imperfections  c How usefully these are distributed to all  Orders of men  how useful they are to  Society  and to the  Individuals  In every  State  and in every  Age  of life to the end  EPISTLE III Of the NATURE and STATE of MAN with respect to SOCIETY  THE  whole Universe  one system of  Society  VER c Nothing is made wholly for  itself  nor yet wholly for  another  The happiness of animals mutual  Reason  or  Instinct  operate alike to the good of each individual  Reason or instinct  operate to  society  in all animals How far  Society  carry'd by Instinct How much farther by Reason Of that which is call'd the  State of Nature  Reason instructed by Instinct in the invention of  Arts  and in the  Forms  of society Origin of  political  Societies Origin of  Manarchy      Patriarchal  government Origin of  true Religion  and  Government  from the same principle of  Love  c Origin of  Superstition  and  Tyranny  from the same principle of  Fear  c The influence of  Selflove  operating to the  social  and  publick good  Restoration of true Religion and Government on their first principle  Mixt Government  Various Forms of each and the  true end  of  all  c  EPISTLE IV Of the NATURE and STATE of MAN with respect to HAPPINESS  HAppiness  ill defin'd by the Philosophers VER That it is the  End  of all men and attainable by all God governs by  general  not  particular  laws intends Happiness to be  equal  and to be so it must be  social  since all particular happiness depends on general As it is necessary for  Order  and the peace and welfare of  Society  that  External goods  should be  unequal  happiness is not made to consist in these But notwithstanding that inequality the Balance of Happiness among mankind is kept even by Providence by the two Passions of  Hope  and  Fear  What the happiness of Individuals is as far as is consistent with the constitution of this world That the  good man  has here the advantage The error of imputing to  Virtue  what are only the calamities of  Nature  or of  Fortune  The folly of expecting that God should alter his General Laws in favour of particulars That we are not judges  who are good  but that whoever they are they must be  happiest  c That  external  goods  are not the proper rewards often inconsistent with or destructive of  Virtue  But that even these can make no man happy without Virtue Instanced in Riches Honours Birth Greatness Fame Superior talents with pictures of human Infelicity in men possest of them all c That VIRTUE ONLY constitutes a Happiness whose Object is  universal  and whose Prospect  eternal  The perfection of which consists in a  conformity  to the  Order  of  Providence  here and in a  resignation  to it here and hereafter Or in other words in  Love of God  and  Charity  to  all men  c  to the end  NIL ADMIRARI  WK  PFsc  EPISTLE I  _AWAKE my ST JOHN leave all meaner things  To low Ambition and the Pride of Kings  Let Us since Life can little more supply  Than just to look about us and to die  Expatiate free o'er all this  Scene of Man    A mighty Maze but not without a Plan  A Wild where weeds and flow'rs promiscuous shoot  Or Garden tempting with forbidden fruit  Together let us beat this ample field  Try what the open what the covert yield  The latent tracts or giddy heights explore  Of all who blindly creep or sightless soar  Eye Nature's walks shoot Folly as it flies  And catch the manners living as they rise  Laugh where we  must  be candid where we  can    But vindicate the Ways of GOD to Man  Say first of  God  above or  Man  below  What can we  reason  but from what we  know  Of Man what see we but his Station here  From which to reason or to which refer  Thro' Worlds unnumber'd tho' the God be known  'Tis ours to trace him only in our own  He who thro' vast Immensity can pierce  See worlds on worlds compose one Universe  Observe how System into System runs  What other Planets and what other Suns  What vary'd Being peoples ev'ry Star  May tell why Heav'n has made us as we are  But of this frame the bearings and the Ties  The strong connections nice dependencies  Gradations just has thy pervading soul  Look'd thro' or can a Part contain the Whole  Is the great Chain that draws all to agree  And drawn supports upheld by God or thee  Presumptuous Man the Reason would'st thou find  Why form'd so weak so little and so blind  First if thou can'st the harder reason guess  Why form'd no weaker blinder and no less  Ask of thy mother Earth why oaks are made  Taller or stronger than the weeds they shade  Or ask of yonder argent fields above  Why Jove's Satellites are less than Jove  Of Systems possible if 'tis confest  That Wisdom infinite must form the best  Where all must full or not coherent be  And all that rises rise in due degree  Then in the scale of life and sense 'tis plain  There must be some where such a rank as Man  And all the question wrangle 'ere so long  Is only this if God has plac'd him wrong  Respecting Man whatever wrong we call  May must be right as relative to All  In human works though labour'd on with pain  A thousand movements scarce one purpose gain  In God's one single can its End produce  Yet serves to second too some other Use  So Man who here seems principal alone  Perhaps acts second to a Sphere unknown  Touches some wheel or verges to some gole  'Tis but a part we see and not a whole  When the proud Steed shall know why Man restrains  His fiery course or drives him o'er the plains  When the dull Ox why now he breaks the clod  Now wears a Garland an Aegyptian God  Then shall Man's pride and dulness comprehend  His action's passion's being's Use and End  Why doing suff'ring check'd impell'd and why  This hour a Slave the next a Deity  Then say not Man's imperfect Heav'n in fault  Say rather Man's as perfect as he ought  His being measur'd to his State and Place  His time a moment and a point his space  Heav'n from all Creatures hides the book of Fate  All but the page prescrib'd their present state  From Brutes what Men from Men what Spirits know  Or who could suffer Being here below  The Lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to day  Had he thy Reason would he skip and play  Pleas'd to the last he crops the flow'ry food  And licks the hand just rais'd to shed his blood  Oh blindness to the future kindly giv'n  That each may fill the Circle mark'd by Heav'n  Who sees with equal eye as God of All  A Hero perish or a Sparrow fall  Atoms or Systems into ruin hurl'd  And now a Bubble burst and now a World  Hope humbly then with trembling pinions soar  Wait the great teacher Death and God adore  What future bliss he gives not thee to know  But gives that  Hope  to be thy blessing now  Hope  springs eternal in the human breast  Man never is but always to be blest  The soul uneasy and confin'd at home  Rests and expatiates in a life to come  Lo the poor Indian whose untutor'd mind  Sees God in clouds or hears him in the wind  His soul proud Science never taught to stray  Far as the Solar walk or Milky way  Yet simple Nature to his Hope has giv'n  Behind the cloudtopt hill an humbler heav'n  Some safer world in depth of woods embrac'd  Some happier Island in the watry waste  Where Slaves once more their native land behold  No Fiends torment no Christians thirst for Gold  To be contents his natural desire  He asks no Angel's wing or Seraph's fire  But thinks admitted to that equal sky  This faithful Dog shall bear him company  Go wiser thou and in thy scale of sense  Weigh thy Opinion against Providence  Call Imperfection what thou fancy'st such  Say here he gives too little there too much  Destroy all Creatures for thy sport or gust  Yet cry if Man's unhappy God's unjust  If Man alone engross not Heav'ns high care  Alone made perfect here immortal there  Snatch from his hand the Balance and the Rod  Rejudge his Justice Be the GOD of GOD  In reas'ning Pride my Friend our error lies  All quit their sphere and rush into the Skies  Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes  Men would be Angels Angels would be Gods  Aspiring to be Gods if Angels fell  Aspiring to be Angels Men rebell  And who but wishes to invert the Laws  Of ORDER sins against th' Eternal Cause  Ask for what end the heav'nly Bodies shine  Earth for whose use Pride answers " 'Tis for mine  " For me kind Nature wakes her genial pow'r  " Suckles each herb and spreads out ev'ry flow'r  " Annual for me the grape the rose renew  " The juice nectareous and the balmy dew  " For me the mine a thousand treasures brings  " For me health gushes from a thousand springs  " Seas roll to waft me suns to light me rise  " My footstool earth my canopy the skies  But errs not Nature from this gracious end  From burning Suns when livid deaths descend  When Earthquakes swallow or when Tempests sweep  Towns to one grave and Nations to the Deep  No 'tis reply'd the first Almighty Cause  " Acts not by partial but by gen'ral Laws  " Th' Exceptions few some Change since all began  " And what created perfect"Why then Man  If the great End be human Happiness  And Nature deviates how can Man do less  As much that End a constant course requires  Of show'rs and sunshine as of Man's Desires  As much eternal springs and cloudless skies  As men for ever temp'rate calm and wise  If Plagues or Earthquakes break not heav'ns design  Why then a Borgia or a Catiline  From Pride from Pride our very reas'ning springs  Account for moral as for nat'ral things  Why charge we heav'n in those in these acquit  In both to reason right is to submit  Better for us perhaps it might appear  Were there all harmony all virtue here  That never air or ocean felt the wind  That never passion discompos'd the mind  But  All  subsists by elemental strife  And Passions are the Elements of life  The gen'ral Order since the whole began  Is kept in Nature and is kept in Man  What would this Man now upward will he soar  And little less than Angel would be more  Now looking downward just as griev'd appears  To want the strength of Bulls the fur of Bears  Made for his use all Creatures if he call  Say what their use had he the pow'rs of all  Nature to these without profusion kind  The proper organs proper pow'rs assign'd  Each seeming want compensated of course  Here with degrees of Swiftness there of Force  It is a certain Axiom in the Anatomy of Creatures that in proportion as they are form'd for Strength their Swiftness is lessen'd or as they are form'd for Swiftness their Strength is abated  All in exact proportion to the state  Nothing to add and nothing to abate  Each Beast each Insect happy in its own  Is Heav'n unkind to Man and Man alone  Shall he alone whom rational we call  Be pleas'd with nothing if not bless'd with all  The bliss of Man could Pride that blessing find  Is not to think or act beyond Mankind  No pow'rs of Body or of Soul to share  But what his Nature and his State can bear  Why has not Man a microscopic eye  For this plain reason Man is not a Fly  Say what the use were finer opticks giv'n  T' inspect a Mite not comprehend the Heav'n  Or Touch if tremblingly alive all o'er  To smart and agonize at ev'ry pore  Or keen Effluvia darting thro' the brain  Die of a Rose in aromatic pain  If Nature thunder'd in his opening ears  And stunn'd him with the music of the Spheres  How would he wish that Heav'n had left him still  The whisp'ring Zephyr and the purling rill  Who finds not Providence allgood and wise  Alike in what it gives and what denies  Far as Creation's ample range extends  The scale of sensual mental pow'rs ascends  Mark how it mounts to Man's imperial race  From the green myriads in the peopled grass  What modes of Sight betwixt each wide extreme  The Mole's dim curtain and the Lynx's beam  Of smell the headlong Lioness  The manner of the Lions hunting their Prey in the Deserts of Africa is this at their first going out in the nighttime they set up a loud Roar and then listen to the Noise made by the Beasts in their Flight pursuing them by the Ear and not by the Nostril It is probable the story of the Jackall's hunting for the Lion was occasion'd by observation of the Defect of Scent in that terrible Animal  between  And hound sagacious on the tainted green  Of hearing from the Life that fills the flood  To that which warbles through the vernal wood  The spider's touch how exquisitely fine  Feels at each thread and lives along the line  In the nice bee what sense so subtly true  From pois'nous herbs extracts the healing dew  How Instinct varies in the groveling swine  Compar'd halfreas'ning Elephant with thine  'Twixt that and Reason what a nice Barrier  For ever sep'rate yet for ever near  Remembrance and Reflection how ally'd  What thin partitions Sense from Thought divide  And middle natures how they long to join  Yet never pass th' insuperable line  Without this just Gradation could they be  Subjected these to those or all to thee  The pow'rs of all subdu'd by thee alone  Is not thy Reason all those pow'rs in one  See thro' this air this ocean and this earth  All Matter quick and bursting into birth  Above how high progressive life may go  Around how wide how deep extend below  Vast Chain of Being which from God began  Natures Ethereal human Angel Man  Beast bird fish insect what no Eye can see  No Glass can reach from Infinite to thee  From thee to NothingOn superior pow'rs  Were we to press inferior might on ours  Or in the full Creation leave a Void  Where one step broken the great Scale's destroy'd  From Nature's Chain whatever link you strike  Tenth or ten thousandth breaks the chain alike  And if each System in gradation roll  Alike essential to th' amazing Whole  The least confusion but in one not all  That System only but the whole must fall  Let Earth unbalanc'd from her Orbit fly  Planets and Suns rush lawless thro' the sky  Let ruling Angels from their spheres be hurl'd  Being on Being wreck'd and World on World  Heav'ns whole foundations to their Centre nod  And Nature tremble to the Throne of God  All this dread ORDER breakFor whom for thee  Vile WormO Madness Pride Impiety  What if the foot ordain'd the dust to tread  Or hand to toil aspir'd to be the Head  What if the head the eye or ear repin'd  To serve mere Engines to the ruling Mind  Just as absurd for any Part to claim  To be Another in this gen'ral Frame  Just as absurd to mourn the tasks or pains  The great directing  Mind  of  All  ordains  All are but parts of one stupendous Whole  Whose Body Nature is and God the Soul  That chang'd thro' all and yet in all the same  Great in the Earth as in th' Aethereal frame  Warms in the Sun refreshes in the Breeze  Glows in the Stars and blossoms in the Trees  Lives thro' all Life extends thro' all Extent  Spreads undivided operates unspent  Breathes in our soul informs our mortal part  As full as perfect in a hair as heart  As full as perfect in vile Man that mourns  As the rapt Seraphim that sings and burns  To Him no high no low no great no small  He fills he bounds connects and equals all  Cease then nor ORDER  Imperfection  name  Our proper bliss depends on what we blame  Know thy own  Point  This kind this due degree  Of blindness weakness Heav'n bestows on thee  Submitin this or any other Sphere  Secure to be as blest as thou canst bear  Safe in the hand of one disposing Pow'r  Or in the natal or the mortal Hour  All Nature is but Art unknown to thee  All Chance Direction which thou canst not see  All Discord Harmony not understood  All partial Evil universal Good  And spight of Pride in erring Reason's spight  One truth is clear "Whatever Is is RIGHT"  WK  PFsc  EPISTLE II  _KNow then thyself presume not God to scan  The proper study of mankind is  Man  Plac'd on this Isthmus of a middle state  A Being darkly wise and rudely great  With too much knowledge for the Sceptic side  With too much weakness for a Stoic's pride  He hangs between in doubt to act or rest  In doubt todeem himself a God or Beast  In doubt his mind or body to prefer  Born but to die and reas'ning but to err  Alike in ignorance his Reason such  Whether he thinks too little or too much  Chaos of Thought and Passion all confus'd  Still by himself abus'd or disabus'd  Created half to rise and half to fall  Great Lord of all things yet a Prey to all  Sole Judge of Truth in endless Error hurl'd  The Glory Jest and Riddle of the world  Go wond'rous Creature mount where Science guides  Go measure Earth weigh Air and state the Tydes  Instruct the Planets in what Orbs to run  Correct old Time and regulate the Sun  Go soar with Plato to th' empyreal sphere  To the first Good first Perfect and first Fair  Or tread the mazy round his Follow'rs trod  And quitting Sense call Imitating God  As Eastern Priests in giddy circles run  And turn their heads to imitate the Sun  Go teach Eternal Wisdom how to rule  Then drop into thyself and be a Fool  Superior Beings when of late they saw  A mortal Man unfold all Nature's Law  Admir'd such Wisdom in an earthly shape  And show'd a NEWTON as we show an  Ape  Could He who taught each Planet where to roll  Describe or fix one Movement of the Soul  Who mark'd their points to rise and to descend  Explain or his Beginning or his End  Alas what wonder Man's superior part  Uncheck'd may rise and climb from Art to Art  But when his own great work is but begun  What Reason weaves by Passion is undone  Two Principles in human Nature reign  SelfLove  to urge and  Reason  to restrain  Nor this a good nor that a bad we call  Each works its end to move or govern all  And to their proper operation still  Ascribe all Good to their improper Ill  SelfLove the Spring of motion acts the soul  Reason's comparing Balance rules the whole  Man but for that no  Action  could attend  And but for this were active to no  End  Fix'd like a Plant on his peculiar spot  To draw nutrition propagate and rot  Or Meteorlike flame lawless through the void  Destroying others by himself destroy'd  Most strength the  moving  Principle requires  Active its task it prompts impels inspires  Sedate and quiet the  comparing  lies  Form'd but to check delib'rate and advise  SelfLove yet stronger as its objects nigh  Reason's at distance and in prospect lye  That sees immediate Good by present sense  Reason the future and the consequence  Thicker than Arguments Temptations throng  At best more watchful this but that more strong  The action of the stronger to suspend  Reason still use to Reason still attend  Attention Habit and Experience gains  Each strengthens Reason and Selflove restrains  Let subtile Schoolmen teach these Friends to fight  More studious to divide than to unite  And Grace and Virtue Sense and Reason split  With all the rash dexterity of Wit  Wits just like fools at war about a Name  Have full as oft no meaning or the same  Selflove and Reason to one end aspire  Pain their aversion Pleasure their desire  But greedy that its object would devour  This taste the honey and not wound the flower  Pleasure or wrong or rightly understood  Our greatest Evil or our greatest Good  Modes of Selflove the PASSIONS we may call  'Tis real Good or seeming moves them all  But since not every Good we can divide  And Reason bids us for our own provide  Passions tho' selfish if their Means be fair  List under  Reason  and deserve her care  Those that imparted court a nobler aim  Exalt their kind and take some  Virtue  's name  In lazy  Apathy  let Stoics boast  Their Virtue fix'd 'tis fix'd as in a Frost  Contracted all retiring to the breast  But Strength of Mind is Exercise not Rest  The rising tempest puts in act the soul  Parts it may ravage but preserves the whole  On Life's vast Ocean diversely we sail  Reason the Card but Passion is the Gale  Nor GOD alone in the still Calm we find  He mounts the Storm and  walks upon the Wind  Passions like Elements tho' born to fight  Yet mix'd and soften'd in his work unite  These 'tis enough to temper and employ  But what composes Man can Man destroy  Suffice that Reason keep to Nature's road  Subject compound them follow her and God  Love Hope and Joy fair Pleasure's smiling train  Hate Fear and Grief the Family of Pain  These mix'd with art and to due bounds confin'd  Make and maintain the Balance of the Mind  The Lights and Shades whose wellaccorded strife  Gives all the Strength and Colour of our life  Pleasures are ever in our hands or eyes  And when in Act they cease in Prospect rise  Present to grasp and future still to find  The whole employ of Body and of Mind  All spread their charms but charm not all alike  On diff'rent Senses diff'rent Objects strike  Hence diff'rent Passions more or less inflame  As strong or weak the Organs of the Frame  And hence one Master Passion in the breast  Like Aaron's Serpent swallows up the rest  As Man perhaps the moment of his breath  Receives the lurking Principle of death  The young Disease that must subdue at length  Grows with his growth and strengthens with his strength  So cast and mingled with his very Frame  The Mind's disease its  ruling Passion  came  Each vital humour which should feed the whole  Soon flows to this in Body and in Soul  Whatever warms the heart or fills the head  As the mind opens and its functions spread  Imagination plies her dang'rous art  And pours it all upon the peccant part  Nature its Mother Habit is its Nurse  Wit Spirit Faculties but make it worse  Reason itself but gives it edge and pow'r  As Heav'n's blest Beam turns Vinegar more sow'r  The ruling Passion be it what it will  The ruling Passion conquers Reason still  We wretched subjects tho' to lawful sway  In this weak Queen some Fav'rite still obey  Ah if she lend not Arms as well as Rules  What can she more than tell us we are Fools  Teach us to mourn our nature not to mend  A sharp Accuser but a helpless Friend  Or from a Judge turn Pleader to persuade  The choice we make or justify it made  Proud of imagin'd Conquests all along  She but removes weak Passions for the strong  So when small Humours gather to a Gout  The Doctor fancies he has driv'n them out  Yes  Nature  's Road must ever be prefer'd  Reason is here no Guide but still a Guard  'Tis her's to rectify not overthrow  And treat this Passion more as Friend than Foe  A MIGHTIER POW'R the strong Direction sends  And sev'ral Men impells to sev'ral Ends  Like varying Winds by other passions tost  This drives them constant to a certain Coast  Let Pow'r or Knowledge Gold or Glory please  Or oft more strong than all the Love of ease  Thro' life 'tis follow'd ev'n at life's expence  The Merchant's toil the Sage's indolence  The Monk's humility the Hero's pride  All all alike find Reason on their side  Th' Eternal Art educing Good from Ill  Grafts on this Passion our best Principle  'Tis thus the Mercury of Man is fix'd  Strong grows the Virtue with his Nature mix'd  The Dross cements what else were too refin'd  And in one int'rest Body acts with Mind  As Fruits ungrateful to the Planter's care  On savage stocks inserted learn to bear  The surest Virtues thus from Passions shoot  Wild Nature's Vigour working at the root  What Crops of Wit and Honesty appear  From Spleen from Obstinacy Hate or Fear  See Anger Zeal and Fortitude supply  Ev'n Av'rice Prudence Sloth Philosophy  Envy to which th' ignoble mind's a slave  Is Emulation in the Learn'd and Brave  Lust thro' some certain Strainers well refin'd  Is gentle Love and charms all Womankind  Nor Virtue male or female can we name  But what will grow on Pride or grow on Shame  Thus Nature gives us let it check our pride  The Virtue nearest to our Vice ally'd  Reason the Byas turns to Good from Ill  And Nero reigns a Titus if he will  The fiery soul abhorr'd in Catiline  In Decius charms in Curtius is divine  The same Ambition can destroy or save  And makes a Patriot as it makes a Knave  This Light and Darkness in our Chaos join'd  What shall divide The God within the Mind  Extremes in nature equal ends produce  In man they join to some mysterious use  Tho' oft so mix'd the diff'rence is too nice  Where ends the virtue or begins the vice  Now this now that the other's bound invades  As in some wellwrought Picture lights and shades  Fools who from hence into the notion fall  That Vice or Virtue there is none at all  If white and black blend soften and unite  A thousand ways is there no black or white  Ask your own Heart and nothing is so plain  'Tis to  mistake  them costs the time and pain  Vice is a monster of so frightful mien  As to be hated needs but to be seen  Yet seen too oft familiar with her face  We first endure then pity then embrace  But where th' Extreme of Vice was ne'er agreed  Ask where's the  North  at York'tis on the Tweed  In Scotland at the Orcades and there  At Greenland Zembla or the Lord knows where  No creature owns it in the first degree  But thinks his Neighbour farther gone than he  Ev'n those who dwell beneath her very Zone  Or never feel the rage or never own  What happier Natures shrink at with affright  The hard Inhabitant contends is right  Virtuous and vicious ev'ry man must be  Few in th' Extreme but all in the Degree  The Rogue and Fool by fits is fair and wise  And ev'n the best by fits what they despise  'Tis but by  Parts  we follow Good or Ill  For Vice or Virtue  Self  directs it still  Each Individual seeks a sev'ral goal  But HEAV'N'S great view is  One  and that the WHOLE  That counterworks each Folly and Caprice  That disappoints th' Effect of ev'ry Vice  That happy Frailties to all ranks apply'd  Shame to the Virgin to the Matron Pride  Fear to the Statesman Rashness to the Chief  To Kings Presumption and to Crowds Belief  That Virtue's Ends from Vanity can raise  Which seeks no int'rest no reward but Praise  And build on Wants and on Defects of mind  The Joy the Peace the Glory of Mankind  Heav'n forming each on other to depend  A Master or a Servant or a Friend  Bids each on other for assistance call  'Till one man's weakness grows the strength of all  Wants Frailties Passions closer still allye  The common int'rest or endear the tye  To these we owe true Friendship Love sincere  Each homefelt joy that Life inherits here  Yet from the same we learn in its decline  Those joys those loves those int'rests to resign  Taught half by reason half by mere decay  To welcome Death and calmly pass away  Whate'er the Passion Knowledge Fame or Pelf  Not one will change his Neighbour with himself  The learn'd are happy Nature to explore  The fool is happy that he knows no more  The rich are happy in the plenty giv'n  The poor contents him with the care of Heav'n  See the blind Beggar dance the Cripple sing  The Sot a Hero Lunatic a King  The starving Chymist in his golden Views  Supreamly blest the Poet in his Muse  See some strange Comfort ev'ry  State  attend  And  Pride  bestow'd on all a common Friend  See some fit Passion ev'ry  Age  supply  Hope  travels thro' nor quits

And 'till he ends the Being makes it blest  Which sees no more the stroke or feels the pain  Than favour'd Man by Touch aetherial slain  Several of the Ancients and many of the Orientals at this day

And ev'ry death its own Avenger breeds  The FuryPassions from that blood began  And turn'd on Man a fiercer savage Man  See him from Nature rising slow to Art  To copy  Instinct  then was  Reason  's

Slaves of Subjects made  She midst the Light'ning's blaze and Thunder's sound  When rock'd the Mountains and when groan'd the ground  She taught the weak to bend the proud to pray  To Pow'r unseen and

One man's Pow'r Ambition Lucre Lust  The same Selflove in All becomes the cause  Of what restrains him Government and Laws  For what one likes if others like as well  What serves one Will when many Wills rebel  How shall he keep what sleeping or awake  A weaker may surprize a stronger take  His Safety must his Liberty restrain  All join to guard what each desires to gain  Forc'd into Virtue thus by Selfdefence  Ev'n Kings learn'd Justice and Benevolence  Selflove forsook the path it first pursu'd  And found the private in the public Good  'Twas then the studious Head or gen'rous Mind  Follo'wer of God or Friend of Humankind  Poet or Patriot rose but to restore  The Faith and Moral  Nature  gave before  Relum'd her ancient light not kindled new  If not God's Image yet his Shadow drew  Taught Pow'rs due use to People and to Kings  Taught not to slack nor strain its tender strings  The Less and Greater set so justly true  That touching one must strike the other too  And jarring

ray  Compute the Morn and Evening to the Day  The whole amount of that enormous Fame  A Tale that blends their Glory with their Shame  Know then this Truth enough for man to know  VIRTUE alone is Happiness below  The only point where human bliss stands still  And tastes the Good without the fall to Ill  Where only Merit constant pay receives  Is bless'd in what it takes and what it gives  The joy unequal'd if its end it gain  And if it lose attended with no pain  Without satiety tho' e'er so bless'd  And but more relish'd as the more distress'd  The broadest Mirth unfeeling Folly wears  Less pleasing far than Virtue's very Tears  Good from each object from each place acquir'd  For ever exercis'd yet never tir'd  Never elated while one Man's oppress'd  Never dejected while another's bless'd  And where no wants no wishes can remain  Since but to wish more Virtue is to gain  See the sole Bliss Heav'n could on  all  bestow  Which who but feels can taste but thinks can know  Yet poor with Fortune and with Learning blind  The Bad must miss the Good untaught will find  Slave to no Sect who takes no private road  But looks thro'  Nature  up to  Nature  's GOD  Pursues that  Chain

Nature whose dictates to no other Kind  Are giv'n in vain but what they seek they find  Wise is the Present she connects in this  His greatest  Virtue  with his greatest  Bliss    At once his own
