LXXXIII  TO THE PRINCE OF WALES  SIR  WHEN I consider the insignificancy of this trifle I am surprised at my own temerity my reason would have recoiled and left nothing but my presumption to attend it

crowned Monckton and Rodney with success and by the capture of  Martinico  secured the conquest of Grenada St Lucia St Vincent and a supreme power over the trade and navigation of the seas and that immeasurable chain of islands which extend from the Eastern point of Hispaniola almost to the Continent of South America With this view did she command Albemarle the Pupil of her favourite Cumberland and Pocock who had before triumphed in the East now to extend our conquests over the Western world The Havannah from its situation a place of the first importance to our enemies the grand rendezvous of the galleons thought  impregnable from nature yet fortified by every possible contrivance of military art most unpromising to a foe from the danger of its access and defended by a Roman spirit in the person of Velasco at this great crisis from the intrepidity perseverance and unanimity of our land and sea forces yielded to the British flag  Amongst the brilliant transactions of a year which

GEORGE  Courtiers Masquers c  SCENE Don Leopold's  Castle within three Leagues of  Saragossa  The BIRTHDAY  ACT I  An Apartment in Don Leopold's Castle  Enter  Prince  and  Frederick  Prince  SO at last we are arriv'd in Don Leopold's castle  Fred  Thank Heaven for since we turn'd our horses heads from the palace of Saragosa my Prince has not till this moment honour'd his faithful Frederick with a single word  Prince  I did imagine my dear Frederick that you wish'd to see me in love  Fred  Without doubtthe darling of your Royal patents the idol of the people the blooming hope of every friend to his country and the impending terror of her soes adorn'd with every grace of nature shining in each accomplishment with all the glowing spirit of a hero ready to burst into action I saw my Prince my master in the midst of a brilliant court surrounded with pleasures but a stranger to happiness  Prince  'Tis true Frederick I was amus'd but never pleas'd  Fred  I saw it I dar'd impell'd by duty to pry into my Prince's thoughts and from the state of your heart this languor this apathy this restless joyless inquietude I plainly saw that in the midst of splendor  Love  was wanting to make you happy  Prince  Ay Frederick but if this love which you imagine so essential to my happiness should plunge me into unutterable woe and render me for ever miserable  Fred  Love make a Prince miserable Impossible  Prince  Why not a Prince as well as another man  Fred  Heir to the Crown of Arragon who has only to ask and obtain to wish and be happy  Prince  Ay Fred'rick but I wou'd have the fair one love me not as the Heir of Arragon I would owe nothing to the dignity of my station  Fred  Well Sir Fortune has arrang'd each circumstance of your adventure here to the full extent of your wishes Chance throws into your hands a Lady's picture the features are just what your fancy imagines to be the most beautiful  in the world and for seven or eight days by your orders I search'd the Court the city the country for the charming original my endeavours proved fruitless and you begin to despair of ever finding this lovely incognita when one day in hunting led by the ardour of the chace having stray'd from your suite you find yourself near the park walls of this castle hear the cry of distress see women pursued by a huge and fierce boar Fired with a generous alarm at their danger you fly to their assistance to kill this monster was but the work of a minute but what a minute of delight of transport A young Lady from weariness and fright having fallen at the foot of a tree presents to your eyes the very identical lovely original of the picture Thus in saving  her  life your first interview was the most auspicious moment of your's  Prince  I own my dear Frederick hitherto I have reason to be content as yet 'tis certain my quality is a secret to Don Leopold and hisdaughter and as I was first introduced to them by your name they still imagine me to be Don Frederick The amiable Seraphina listens to my vows with the most flattering complacency approves my passion answer's each gentle sigh each tender look with the sweet sympathy of  dear affection and by her permission I made a formal demand to her father of her hand in marriage  Fred  Which he readily granted not knowing you to be the Prince of Arragon  Prince  The old Gentleman did not hesitate a moment and this very day the anniversary of my Birth Day Don Leopold has fixed for the celebration of our marriage  Fred  Then nothing but the joy of the night can exceed the happiness of the day  Prince  Ah Frederick this day may be most unhappy Seraphina loves me but before I wed her I am resolved to put her affection to the proof if it cannot bear the trial oh Frederick what a severe stroke to a heart so tender so sensible so passionate as mine  Fred  Well my Lord I hope all for the bestHa ha ha I'm diverted even at the idea of Don Leopold's surprize and embarrassment when he finds that you're the Prince I assure you he'll entertain you with such things as never yet reached a royal ear  Prince  Ay that I suppose for the character of my old Don tho'rough is noble free and independent Hush here he comes remember I am Don Frederick and you are my attendant  Exit Fred  Don Leop  without  Be quietshold your tonguessay no more it's all in vainridiculous to propose it No no no courts for me  enters  Ah they did not tell me you were here  Prince  But just arriv'd Sir you seem angry  Leop  So I am very angry  Prince  What's the matter Don Leopold  Leop  My daughter wants to carry me to Court  Prince  Why not Sir A nobleman of your birth and distinction should not thus bury himself hi the country  Leop  In the country I live upon my own estate  Prince  Yes but from the character I have given of you the Prince I'm sure would wish to be known to you  Leop  I tell you what boy I've as much respect for my Prince as you I obey I esteem I love him and were there a cause the last drop of my blood should write my loyalty I'd die to serve him But I don't like new acquaintance I am too old  Prince  And yet I will assure you Don Leopold the Prince wishes for nothing more than to have you nearly attached to him  Leop  Me On what account  Prince  To have in your rare and valuable character a man of candour and probity incapable of falsehood on whose honor whose friendship he might rely and place an intire confidence in his fidelityyou laugh  Leop  Yes Ha ha very good the Prince wishes to have me near him me whom he never saw because forsooth you have told him that I am a person of probity and candour  Prince  Just so I'll answer for your welcome go when you please  Leop  Will you first answer for my going for go I will not no no he sees bad company enough already  Prince  But  Leop  None of your buts you are going to be my Soninlaw take it once for all I was never made for a courtier I am a fantastical ridiculous old fellow that thinks noble birth wants no decoration of title that a star upon a breast cannot give honor to a heart that's base nor a ribbon dignity to a neck that perhaps deserves a halter Tho' I live at a great expence I keep within my income I have not use for more than half the servants I maintain but then the other half I consider have use  for me and tho' I am a Lord I am as free from debt as the poorest commoner  Prince  You would indeed be an extraordinary character at court  Leop  Ay ay Don Frederick but I prefer being lodged in this old castle of mine here to the honor of being inconveniently situated near a Prince in one word I'd rather walk about my park gardens and my own improvements than to slide and amble through an antichamber like a cypher of great importance in a groupe of idle busybodies female profligates reverend atheists mock patriots and right honourable sharpers the whole forming a villainous picture a curious court calendar  Prince  Then 'tis impossible to persuade you to accompany us  Leop  Then don't attempt ask a lover to resign his mistress a lady to praise her rival a lawyer to tell truth and a Doctor to return his fee but never ask me to go to court you shall not change my mode of thinking nor shall I try to alter your's  AIR  Dr ARNOLD  The Court is a fountain of honour and fame  And sweet are the waters that flow  Yet say if our throats or this water's to blames  As we drink the more thirsty we grow  yet the Court to be sure is a fine place  A gay a polite a divine place  I am the man can tell you bow  If there you'd wish to rise  With your every step a bow  On your tongue a thousand lies  Submissive be your stile  A great man's frown's a rod  A pension in his smile  A ribbon in his nod  Strict care and close oeconomy  First make a mighty brag on  But set to guard the golden tree  Then gobble like a dragon  Enter  Frederick  speaks apart to the Prince  Fred  Your attendants wait their orders  Prince  Very well  Enter  Florina  Leop  Florina where's my daughter  Flori  I left her in the garden Sir I fancy she's reading in the jessamine alcove  Leop  Hey Don Frederick don't you wish to see her ay ay well well goyou hear she is in the jessamine alcove  Flori  Oh pray go Sir 'tis the sweetest place to make love in sing her an amorous ditty and the pretty little birds shall play up the symphonies  Leop  Hark ye I'll play up a symphony with you hussey if you strike up your amorous ditties in my daughter's hearingBut go to her Frederick while I go and prepare for your wedding and some little fancies of my own to honour the Birth Day of my Prince This night Seraphina shall be your wife and tomorrow morning if you will go there lies your way to court and here lies mine to my groves and gardens  Exeunt  Leopold  and  Prince  severally  Flori  Then at last the delicious moment is at hand when we shall bid adieu to this crazy castle these insensible trees these dismal groves and melancholy gardens  Fred  You are weary of this place hey  Flori  Weary of itthat I am  Fred  Variety pleases you  Flori  Infinitely I detest sameness order and odious method I delight in noise hurry  shew and rattling confusionOh heavens I've conceiv'd the most charming ideas of a Court  Fred  And you are a charming girl you are form'd for a courtthat graceful mien this fine shape  puts his hand gently round her waist  that expressive sensibility of countenance those speaking eyes those ruby lips  going to kiss her  Flori  My lips are well enough so let them alone if you please  pushes him back  Fred  With all your gaiety sprightliness and vivacity such shining qualifications for good company you cannot fail of success  Flori  Yes I flatter myself there is a little something a certaininexpressivethatay ay my Je ne scai quoi will do the business  AIR II  Dr ARNOLD  Year wise men all declare  Of the thing so strange and rare  The beautiful sublime in great nature's law  A women bears the belle  And why they cannot tell  'Tis the mystical charms of the  Je ne sçai quoi  II  The lovely townbred dame  Dear cause of many a flame  Each smart swears he ne'er such a beauty saw  Say what the lovers prize  Coral lips or brilliant eyes  No the mystical charms of the  Je ne sçai quoi  III  Behold the village maid  By nature's hand array'd  With her stockings green and her hat of straw  Is love in dimple sleek  Or the roses of her cheek  No the mystical charms of the  Je ne sçai quoi  You and I are going to live in the same house come let us be open and candid do you resolve to govern your master  Fred  Most certainly I will  Flori  Well mind take care that you do for I am positively determined to govern my mistress 'en't I right  Fred  Certainly ay and she'll be Well governed  Flori  Why yes it isn't that I want to make a great fortune that is all at once I'm not covetous or ambitious but you know one must be a little vain when one is plac'd with a lady  who is wife to the Prince's favourite my education may have been limited but for all that I hope to play my cards with such address that I shall soon have a little court of my own  Fred  What a baggage  aside  I dare say you will and from this moment I put myself under your patronage and protection  Flori  Well I shall take care of you indeed at first you may be of some use to me  Fred  As how pray  Flori  Why you must help me in collecting little intrigues adventures and anecdotes  Fred  Then I find you have no aversion to scandal  Flori  Why you know scandal is a waiting woman's most necessary qualification  Fred  You are an ingenious pretty little soul that's the truth on'toh here comes my master  Flori  And my mistress hey they seem to have had a wrangle  Fred  Something's the matter indeed  Flori  Well come along it's none of our business let's leave them to themselves for  when two lovers fall out they can always decide the quarrel without seconds  Fred  I was order'd by my master to attend him here  Flori  What two to one against my mistress Oh then I'll stand by to see fair play  Both retire to the back of the stage  Enter  Prince  affecting disorder and embarrassment followed by  Seraphina  Sera  Cruel Frederick why did your valour save my life your merit win my heart when now you make your Seraphina wretched by seeming so unhappy on the very day of our union  Prince  Oh heavens  Sera  You seem alarm'd I ask the reason you answer me with sighs and look to heaven Explain the cause of these emotions or I'll instantly acquaint my father  Prince  Stay Madam  Sera  Speak then why am I treated thus  Prince  Just heaven your indignation I deserve and with patience I submit Oh Seraphina  With great emotion  Sera  Speak my Frederick  Weeps  Prince  Dry your tears they fall for a wretch unworthy of your pity  Sera  Unworthy You are worthy of my tenderest regard my affection my love  AIR  Dr ARNOLD  Sweetest passion of the mind  Generous noble unconfin'd  Sov'reign love that sways the soul  Love is fate above controul  Purest source of honour truth  Kind director of our youth  This her preceptvirtue prize  Emulate the bless'd above  To be worthy what you love  Prince  No more this kindness but aggravates my guilt  Sera  Guilt  Prince  My perfidy  Sera  How  Prince  To you Seraphina I am a traitor and when I disclose my treachery your tenderness of affection will turn to contempt and abhorrence  Sera  Betray'd by my Frederick  Prince  Listen to the story of my falshood and then abandon me to the keen remorse which must for ever punish and torment me Yesterday having obtain'd the consent of my Prince for our marriage Frederick says he from the fidelity by which I know you are attached to me I make no doubt of your concern at my late inquietude of mind and of your anxiety to know and if in your power to remove the cause cou'd you imagine it possible that the portrait of a young lady whom I never saw nor know has made such a deep impression on my heart that till I find her till she's mine your Prince must be unhappy Here behold examine see if nature ever form'd any thing so lovely altogether such a combination of beauties Here take it Frederick I trust this precious picture to your care Reply not fly my dear friend search every where and if possible find this adorable woman this charming unknown Judge Seraphina judge of my astonishment my grief when I beheldthese these are the features that have caught the Prince's heart there is the picture that he trusted to my care  Gives the picture  Flori  Looks over Seraphina's shoulder at the picture  Lord Madam this is your own picture    While  Seraphina  and  Florina  are looking at the picture the  Prince  watches  Seraphina  's countenance and speaks apart to  Frederick  Prince  Frederick I doubt her constancy but desire my attendants to be in readiness  Exit  Frederick  Sera  'Tis indeed mine the very picture that my father had drawn about a month after my return from the convent and that he lost a few days after  Prince  And which fortune has thrown into the hands of the Prince but instead of repaying his confidence with fidelity instead of throwing myself at his feet and confessing that I was his rival I endeavour'd to conceal my embarrassment and turn his passion aside with a forc'd laugh I affected to rally his love for a person unknown and to cool his transport urg'd that the picture might have flatter'd that the original might not be living that those fine features perhaps never existed but in the painter's fancy In short my perfidious jealousy left nothing unsaid that might prevent his curiosity  from any further attempt to discover you  Flori  Aside  You had little to do I think  Prince  Mad with the fear of having my treasure snatch'd from me I flew to your father and urg'd him to hasten our marriage I summon'd all my dissimulation to master my anxiety before him but when I approach'd your presence that unsuspecting innocence that air of frankness and sincerity even triumph'd over your charms the tender and ingenuous joy you express'd at seeing me when heaven itself had design'd you for a throne confounded my intentions I had no longer power to disguise the cruel conflict that agitated my soul You lovely Seraphina perceived my emotions your kind solicitude has produced this explanation there now remains no more for me but to quit your presence and for ever banish from your sight my shame my guilt and my confusion  Flori  Ay do go along and send the Prince to us  Aside  Enter  Frederick  Fred  Sir there's a courier arrived from court he says he was ordered to make extraordinary haste as he comes to you with news of very great consequence  Prince  Affects much embarrassment  News heaven the Prince has not discover'd  Sera  Go Frederick see what his business is  Prince  Aside  Aye I see her love is extinguish'd Oh Seraphina I have nothing to hope and fear the worst  Exeunt  Prince  and  Fred  Flori  Well men are all foxes so cunning and so false Now wou'dn't any body in the world have sworn that this Don Frederick's love was real  Sera  And after such a proof can I doubt the reality of his love  Flori  A pretty way of fhewing it to deprive you of a crown O fie He ought to be asham'd of himself Dear Madam at the first sight of the picture a real lover would have cried out in a transport of joy " My Prince I know it that's the picture of Donna Seraphina de Quintana ay and not half so handsome as that beautiful young lady Oh Sir if you were but to see her Such an air such a charming  face you'd declare Sir that not a woman in the world would so well become a throne" There Madam that would be the language of a true lover  Sera  Cease Florina my mind is tortured with cruel reflections  AIR  Dr ARNOLD  My dawn of life how bright how gay  Blythe zephyrs play'd around  Sweet Flora Goddess of the May  Came smiling on to cheer the day  With roseate chaplets crown'd  Tho' morn and noon new joys bestow  While peace and love attend  The smiling landscape changes now  And fate alone can tell me how  The doubtful night must end  Flori  What an escape what would have become of you if he had concealed his treachery till you were married Dear Madam I tremble to think of it  Sera  Prythee peace no more of this  Flori  You are right Madam I'm wrong 'tis with the glory that awaits you I ought to entertain you You'll soon be a Princess after  that be a Queen Charming delightful transporting the very thought gives extacy  Sera  Ah Florina you and I differ much in our opinion of the road to happiness  DUETT III  DrARNOLD  SERAPHINA  Sweet content can banish strife

Shepherds lutes  FLORINA  Fiddles and flutes  SERAPHINA  Give me love end nothing's wanting  FLORINA  Give me love and some gallanting  BOTH  Sera  Those are the joys of the Sylvan scene  Flor  Those are the joys of the courtly scene  END OF ACT FIRST  ACT II  The Outside of Don Leopold's Castle  Enter  Prince  and  Frederick  Prince  NOW Frederick now for the trial and if I prove my Seraphina's mind as pure as her person is charming this day gives her my hand and tomorrow when presented to the King my father her beauty and her virtue must justify my choice and give an added splendor to the court of Saragossa  Fred  Behold my Lord she comes and her little Governess tooAh her councils do no great service to her mistress's cause  Enter  Seraphina  and  Florina  Prince  Madam I am lost undone you've now ample revenge a particular friend at Saragossa  has given me notice that the Prince himself will be here in an hour  Seraph  The Prince  Prince  Yes my good my royal master having heard of my approaching marriage ever solicitous for my welfare and happiness and little suspecting how much I've abus'd his confidence has signified his royal pleasure that he'll honour the ceremony with his presence  Seraph  What a stroke of fortune  Florina  Ay Madam who can say that fortune's blind when she has now hit the nail on the head so nicely  Seraph  Today do you say Frederick  Prince  This day this hour every moment I expect him drawn hither by his friendship for me he forsakes the court even at the time when a happy people rejoices at the auspicious day that gave birth to their Prince the darling of their hopes and as he imagines to give me a more joyful surprise I'm inform'd that he comes mask'd with a few select friends who Attend him from the palace  Flori  Mask'd what a pityOh the dear dear Prince how I do long to see him  Aside  Seraph  In the distress this accident has thrown me what can I say to alleviate your  grief You know Frederick my will depends upon a father  Prince  I understand you Madam  Seraph  To him my duty obliges me to submit  Prince  Certainly Madam and no doubt but he has already order'd you to think of me no more  Seraph  My father loves me tenderly we have no reason to imagine but that he'll order every thing for the best I'll go seek him and immediately acquaint you with his determination  Exit  Prince  Confusion  Walks up the stage in disorder  Fred  to Florina  Well what's you opinion of this affair  Flori  Presently we'll acquaint you with Our determination  Walks off very stately  Prince  There Frederick what think you now  Fred  As yet I cannot  Prince  Oh I see plainly what I'm to expect Yes yes she's resolv'd to reject me and you see with what art she endeavoured to prepare me for my dismissionher father's determinationa mere excuse for her caprice and sordid inconstancy  Fred  Nay my Prince my dearest master wait but a little before your opinion totally condemns her  Prince  No more Frederick in vain you attempt her justification but I shall have the pleasure of enjoying her confusion when she comes to know me Is my mask and domino ready  Frederick bows  Ay ay to punish her infidelity even if she did love me spite of the violence I do myself by such a'resolution by Heavens she loses me for ever  Exit  Fred  Yes I begin myself to think her constancy's a little shakenoh now we shall know more  Enter  Fiorina  Flor  This is an unlucky accident for you master young man  Fred  Unlucky not a happier Gentleman in all Spain if he can but secure the Prince's favour and keep your mistress's heart  Flor  How do you mean to keep her heart  Flori  Why if she prefers him to the Prince  Flori  And how can you think any woman capable of such a folly  Fred  Folly hasn't she confest to Don Frederick that she lov'd him  Florina snaps her fingers  Nay didn't you yourself tell me how much the lov'd him  Flori  Love ha ha ha I like you for that What a boy is your master to catch at such a bubble and what a fool are you to talk of it A young girl has fine notions of marriage because it releases her from the convent therefore the first good match that offers receives her approbation but if a  better  than that good match shou'd after present itself sure that first approbation shou'd not be construed into love No such thing I tell you and yet you men exclaim the perfidious woman the false fair one the cruel creature Now that's so unreasonable absurd and ridiculous ha ha ha  Fred  So women first love only to be married and afterwards hate for the very same reason Ah you are pretty toys indeed and yet it is in the power of that alabaster face of your's to turn the head of the wisest statesman in Europe  Flori  Oh heavens from that lamentable tone one would imagine that your head was in some danger from my alabaster face oh do say so and you'l divert me do make me laugh you creature  AIR  PICCINI  Quick for a smile implore me  Your Goddess sue  How odd to view  Such charms and not adore me  Tho' girls may boast more merit  You'll ne'er hit on  A pretty one  Of more vivacity and spirit  I'II rattle I'll prattle  I'll prattle I'll rattle  Ye creatures  The toy for your money  My word sweet as honey  So roguish and funny  My features  Gay bloom of opening roses  And thousand fragrant posies  Sly winking and blinking  AS leering and jeering  So arch all  For trust me when love's drum  Beats come come come  Hearts thumping  Brisk jumping  Age pacing  Youth racing  Some hopping  None stopping  Ye march all  Ha ha ha oh lud here comes Don Leopold  Enter  Don Leopold  Flori  running to him  Oh Sir Sir Sir  Leop  Well Sir Sir Sir what the deuce is the matter with the girl  Flor  Have you seen my mistress Sir did she tell you Sir  Leop  Very odd  Flori  There Sir you find if you will not go to court the court will come to you  Leop  Yes I have heard of the retinue I am to expect under my roof  Flori  Yes Sir the Prince the charming Prince  Leop  to Frederick  Oh where's your master  Fred  Heaven knows Sir in his distracted state of mind a man cannot stay long in any one place  Leop  Yes his mind can't be very easy I suppose  Fred  Why Sir do you think my master so very blameable  Leop  Blameable you'll see my friend when the King's anger bursts upon him that's allyou'll seemark my words now you will see the extent of court gratitude▪ Go find him friend  Fred  I will Sir I don't know what to think of the old Gentleman  Exit  Frederick  Flori  But seriously now Sir don't be angry with menow would you not be very much displeased if Don Frederick had married my mistressyes yes I see your heart beat your cheeks glow your eyes twinkle at the thoughts of having your daughter a queen oh dear Sir all your grandsons will be little Princes  Leop  Princes their Grandfather's maxim is this the greatest monarch that ever lived will find sufficient glory in supporting properly the character of a Gentleman  Flor  Oh dear Sir I have no patience you that are as high in your notions as the best of them ay and as proud too as any Grandee in all Spain Now Sir confess was not your sole motive for retiring from the court because you would not stoop and cringe to those that thought themselves above you but now Sir your pride will be gratified instead of your making court to any body now every body make court to you  Leop  Girl you are full of pratego you to court you are fit for no other place just the thing full of chat with a vivacity that means nothing you have articulations tones words but not a scruple of common sense made for a little selfimportant court gadder to dangle frisk and hop about like an impertinent wagtail as you are  AIR  Dr ARNOLD  When first an Arragonian maid  Is brought to Saragossa  Of all she sees and hears afraid  Her air is coarse and grossa  Stiff formal starch reserv'd and coy  She seems a very prudea  And while the courtier tempts to joy  Cries "fie you shan't be rudea"  II  But soon as cast in fashion's mould  She's made a dame of honor  Politely frank genteelly bold  No shyness rests upon her  She paints coquettes and flirts her fan  For now the case revers'd Sir  She's grown a match for ev'ry man  And cries "pray do your worst Sir"  Enter  Prince  in Mask and Dominowith  Frederick  Prince  unmasks  Now Frederick I hope and dread the fatal moment it is with reluctance I put my Seraphina to this proof which if I now decline I feel that I shall still imagine there is something left undone that might have ensured my lading felicity  Fred  Sir as you have begun finish your part with your wonted resolution  Prince  Now I assume my own person here a mask I trust will alter my voice sufficiently as they suspect no deceptionshe comes we must not be seen together  Enter  Seraphina  Prince  puts on his mask  Where is Frederickbut I presume this is his charming bride  Approaching to salute  Seraphina  stops suddenly effecting great surprise  What do I see is it  possible Are you Madam the Lady that Don Frederick is about to marry  Seraphina curtseys  the dear original of the picture I trusted to his care Persidious traitor 'Twas but yesterday he undertook to find out the charming object whose portrait captivated every sense and made an impression on my heart never to be erased  Sera  Sir Can I believe  Prince  Oh Madam do not doubt a passion the most tender and sincere  Sera  Sir I shou'd have thought that the pursuit of a great Prince the heir of Arragon would have taken a nobler course than to seek an humble recluse like me and receive honour by conferring it with his addresses on some Princess whose birth might dignify the throne that waits him and whose alliance might extend his fame and add strength to the interest of his kingdom  Prince  'Tis for you that throne's reserv'd which must receive lustre from your beauty Doubtless 'twas providence that threw your picture in my way that now sent me hither in the very moment you were going to be lost to me for ever Heaven ordain'd you mine and let your consent confirm its dispensation  Sera  Sir it wou'd be an idle affectation in me to plead insensibility to the merits of a Prince exalted by his virtues even above the splendor of his birth  Prince  Amiable Lady A thousand thousand thanks for this generous frankness But stop not there oh make me happydeclare that Frederick has not touch'd your heart that you consented to marry him without love as without repugnance free from inclination but as he was the choice of your father  Sera  The choice of my heart  Prince  Madam  Sera  There my Frederick is enthron'd never to be dispossessed  Prince  Oh rapture  Aside  What a subject preferr'd to me  Sera  To worlds I love himlet that excuse a disobedience to my Prince so foreign to my wish  AIR  PICCINI  Ah fond lover sooth thy anguish  Cease to grieve ah cease to languish  Since with your's I'll never part  Keep and treasure up my heart  Royal youth ah cease to woo me  Why with hopeless love pursue me  Success thy wishes crowning  Each tender vow disowning  Tyrant fashion love dethroning  True to Frederick I'll prove  And reward his faithful love  Suffer me Sir to retire and acquaint my father that you honour his castle with your presence  Prince  One moment Madam  Sera  In pity Sir do not force me to violate the respect that your rank demands what can I say more The instant I heard of your arrival at my father's feet I implor'd his protection declar'd if he receded from his promise of my hand to Don Frederick I'd shut myself from the world for ever  Prince  What rather than renounce your lover when a Prince  Sera  Frederick's dearer to my soul than every earthly blessing his presence imparts more joy to me than the possession of crowns and sceptres could bestow  Prince  Discovers himself  And all too little to repay a love so pure so generous  Sera  What do I see  Prince  Behold your Prince who under the borrow'd name of Frederick beguil'd you of your heart  Enter severally  Don Leopold Florina Frederick  and  Courtiers  There comes the real Don Frederick  Leop  What's this  Prince  On my knees I solicit your hand with all the extatic raptures of a lover Don Leopold I claim your promise  Leop  My Lord I came hither to represent to you my prior engagement to Don Frederick but little imagin'd 'twas to my Prince I had promis'd my daughter  Prince

all along that you ought to have a Prince for your husband  Sera  Yes Florina but if by your counsel I had rejected Don Frederick I had probably lost my Prince for ever  Leop  My Lord I must entreat your pardon for some things I have said which on recollection I think I might as well have left alone  Prince  No pardon without a penance my good fatherinlaw and that is to accompany us to the Court  Flori  To Court Oh I'll answer for my master my Lord and we'll all go to Court  Curtseys  Leop  Will you Ah my dear Lord the Court now wou'd be a mortal restraint upon one of my age and humour Peace

wedding of my daughter  Prince  I am honour'd by the affection of such a father and every Monarch must esteem the loyalty of such a subject  Leop  Frank and free as I am I am a true and loyal subject Sir I honour you and love my Seraphina and such is your virtue such your filial affection that I am sure you will join  in the wish with which I commence our festival  Prince  Express your wish and be assur'd of our concurrence  Leop  May the present great and good possessor of the throne and his amiable consort reign for many many years the delight of his family and a blessing to his People
