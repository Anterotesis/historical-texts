is better qualified as far as experience goes to set this matter in a properer light than myself because I have wasted more brick mortar and money than any other individual in Europe Let him who hath seen judge and let him  point out proprieties to others who hath bitterly felt his own folly It is on this principle that I shall circumstantially relate certain pleasantries which cost me many years of my time and many thousand pounds of my money  Not that this work will be generally useful for luckily more of my readers erect houses for themselves than for others and there is no danger of its ever becoming a  fashion  to ruin oneself by a good intention Benevolence is in these days a tolerable oeconomistas prudent a lady as could be well desired in a familyand we have nothing to fear from the influence of excessive virtues The nation will never be destroyed that way  Praise therefore to the discreet qualities of the age my warning will be only for a few and those chiefly a set of simpletons who work up their hearts to a warmth that mounts into the brain and brings on the convulsions of sympathy Such hath been my disorder  It is to you ye gentle beings whose bosoms are fraught with foreign woes whose weeping eyes and milky tempers render you the slaves rather than the friends of virtue to you I address the sentiments and the adventures of a man who was arrogant enough to suppose he could make human creatures live FOR rather than UPON one another  Yes I am the man who hath attempted this The success or miscarriage  of that attempt must be  your lesson  As to the rest of the world I desire heartily it may have  its laugh  I shall have no objection to such ridicule The labourer is worthy of his hire  CHAP II A GOODNATURED PAGE OR TWO WHICH MAY PERHAPS MEND THE READER'S TEMPER  ABOUT six years ago I had retired into one of the most romantick parts of Cumberland and was one day so tenderly inclined men have their fits of benevolence that every thing within contact was the better for me It happened to be a day too wherein many opportunities of being gracious presented themselves Destiny seemed to take advantage of it by a care to supply me with objects It is worth your while to mark how my feelings were exercised The old cat brought into the world nine young and I saw  eight of them basketted for death Savage cried I to the servant carry back the poor things to their mother and instead of straw let them be wrapped up in cotton Scarce was this reprieve given to the offspring of one party before that of another rose to view I was one of his majesty's justices and it seems the peace which it was my office to guard had been broken by a wench who had been so improvident to follow the impulses of nature before they were sanctified by law Wretch said the constable who was dragging her before me how dare you bring your burthens on this parish Wretch said I to the constable what is that to thee So I gently chid the mother and kissed the child for she had concealed herself  till that time and was taken in the wicked act of giving it suck This fired the feelings of the constable and softened mine Let a chamber and a cradle be provided for this child and give something comfortable to the mother and pray carry some new milk to the cat with nine kittens Shall I save a cat and have no charity for a fellowcreature These strokes so smoothed me and prepared for future events that I was almost afraid to breathe out my joy lest with that breath I should destroy the animalcula which naturalists say are thereby murthered I set my foot on the ground with caution lest I should crush some honest insect that might be as well disposed as myself My very legs ached when I perceived I was within an hair's  breadth of extirminating an ant who was laden with food which I could not but fancy was designed to a sick friend in the neighbouring hillock As I pursued my walk along my garden wishing the universe a thousand good lucks I cast my eye aslant a quickset and saw a Linnet extending the maternal wing over her nest Looking behind me I beheld the gardener whetting his sheers Hark ye friend said I in that hedge there is a family which I take upon me to protect and therefore so far from your clipping off a twigBut sir it spoils the look of the whole garden interrupted the gardener I was so shocked at the fellow's inhumanity that my hand had insensibly got into my pocket to feel for the price of his discharge Not  choosing to be whimsical I thought it best to go another way to work I put half a crown into his hand and told him I preferred the luxuriant branches of the natural hedge to the smuggest alteration he and his sheers could possibly make This did not quite satisfy him The man had got a habit of spoiling Nature and loved lopping away a beauty in his soul My Linnet seemed to suspect him She had shifted about in her nest so as to command his whole person I trembled for her How is thy wife today John said I As well as can be expected sir replied he for a woman who looks to be brought to bed every hour she has the headach too and I am obliged to take off my shoes to go into her chamber John said I you  are a very honest fellowgive me your handlet us walk and speak softly there is a worthy female in your wife's situation now in that hedge  Is there siranswered the gardener in a whisper and collecting into his face all the lines of cautionhush hushhush  He beckoned me exactly as he would have done had I rashly opened the door of his wife's chamber The sensation was brought home  There is no call for sheers at present sir said he and the less we walk that way the betterhushhush hush  He now repeated his signal to keep silence and went off on tiptoe till he gained the greensward  Thus was my humour still more sweetened I was so happy that I looked up to the sun which shone on me with emulation with rivalry  A little rhapsody escaped meand were it possible my beam should be like thine There is not a single object which some ray or other of my benevolence should not animate  Taking my eyes from the heavens and casting them to earth I saw a cluster of Pinks drooping for want of a support Warmed as I then was 'tis inconceivable with how much pleasure I placed them about a stick and tied them gently round it As they stood erect in their new attitude there came from them an odour that seemed to thank me It may be the  fragrance of gratitude Imagination chose to think it such What amiable deception  But I had just turned from the flowers when an insect which settled upon my left cheek stung me so sensibly that I raised up my arm and spread my hand to flap it into annihilation Bodily pain is a trying point I took out a pocket glass which I happened to have about me and viewed my enemy The motion had alarmed him and his tongue was taken out of my cheek There are strange traits in my character I represented him as having just risen from banquetting to his heart's content The orifice he had made was not bigger than a small pin's head The appearance  was at worst that of a pimplethe pain was gone It is but the harvest bump of an happy insect said IIt was too fine a day methought to banish any thing animate from the light and I was in too good a temper to be vindictive  Get thee gone fool said Ishakeing my head Much good may it do thee It buzzed thanks and flew away  At this crisis my daughter came running to tell me her Canary had recovered and she had just saved her brood of Chicks from the Kite  Better and better still Matilda said I let us go into the house The heart was stirred  CHAP III OF THE LATE WM SHENSTONE ESQ  TO exercise the soul in benevolent trifles is a good way to prepare it for matters of more consequence After these transactions I and my daughter Matilda were sittting at the door of an airy hall that commanded one of the finest lawns in my garden What an evening said Matilda is there any thing in nature papa so fine as a setting sun Yes said I in an extacy starting at the same time from my seat a  rising  one Matilda agreed to the remark but seemed surprised at the emotion She did not know there was more "meant than met the ear" While ideas were operating  into fit language there was a profound silence and during this interval on our parts the birds began to carol forth their evening songs and all the notes of a summer sunsettingtime poured upon the ear In this voluptuous sensation we remained till Matilda ran to the library and brought a book telling me that  reading  was the only thing wanting to perfect our felicity Then read my dear said I read  I have brought one of those books papa continued Matilda which was written by your friend  Mr Shenstone  Look ye it is the second volume  You could not have laid your fair hand on any thing so  apropos  Shenstone is of all other moderns  the  author to finish a fine evening after having passed the former part of the day in gentle deeds  Where then shall I read  You cannot open him amiss  Ah generous enthusiasm how wert thou befriended in this moment The first sentiment which Matilda recited was the following The soul of Shenstone shone through every syllable  I feel an avarice of social pleasure which produces only mortification I never see a town or city in a map but I figure to myself many agreeable persons in it with whom I could wish to be acquainted  What a thought said I I could have found it in my heart to have  sallied out in search of new and valuable acquaintance The kind nerves began to thrill  The next sentiment which my daughter pitched upon carried the matter still farther  What Miriads wish to be as blest as I  The idea of all the large property I possessed came across me and I could not help sayingwhat Miriads then could I bless The warmth of the blood increased  The third passage cost me forty thousand pounds  Had I a fortune of eight or ten thousand pounds a year I would methinks make myself a neighbourhood I would first build a village  with a church and people it with inhabitants of some branch of trade that was suitable to the country round I would then at proper distances erect a number of genteel boxes of about a thousand pounds apiece and amuse myself with giving them all the advantages they could receive from taste These would I people with a select number of wellchosen friends assigning to each annually the sum of two hundred pounds for life The salary should be irrevocable in order to give them independency The house of a more precarious tenure that in cases of ingratitude I might introduce another inhabitant  At the close of this sentence which by the bye did not finish the passage  Matilda kissed the printed page and said a thousand civil things of the author It was impossible to go any further My whole soul was at work Dost thou not begin to smile reader  Ah Matilda had I permitted thee to read the other period thou mightest have been at least forty thousand pounds richer  We shall close Mr Shenstone's book and this chapter together It shows a good deal  CHAP IV WHICH PROVES THE AUTHOR'S DAUGHTER TO BE A STRANGE GIRL  THE gentle Matilda took me by the arm and we had another turn in the garden The last lingering efforts of light were glimmering It was the still hour when benevolent schemes are best projected Sitting down on a painted bench we entered into conversation Daughter said I were it not for thee I feel myself this moment full of a plan that I should certainly put in practise The plans which my papa forms  must  be all generous and I am therefore concerned to hear that  I  stand in the way  betwixt him and a generous action Matilda you are naturally intitled to my fortune It is a bachelor only who can be rich enough to be whimsical There is a powerful check on a father He is accountable to his child for every guinea so that though I am full as I said before of a scheme which might perhaps build up the happiness of many families I cannot persuade myself to do it on the ruins of thy inheritance No I would rather seem just than romantick  Pray sir how rich may you be  I have ten thousand ayear and some ready money Matilda  Had I that sum I should lay out  nine  of them annually in the cause  of various humanity and live like a queen upon my tenths  Indeed  And does my papa suppose I could be guilty of employing more than a thousand pounds ayear upon  myself  I told thee reader she was a strange girl  Oh there are many who employ that sum on their individual selves in a month my dear  Perhaps so but it is a  science  too difficult for your Matilda so pray  pursue your project  sir  Will it not clip the wing of your future liberality should mine be now exerted to the usage of the greatest part of my fortune Consider Matilda  Can a great examplecan learning me how to fly to the noblest heights clip the wings of liberality No sir it will rather expand them the sooner generous actions are done the better and the sooner you learn me the  art  of doing them in the most effectual manner the more reason shall I have to thank you Pray papa do your duty by me  How much Matilda would you give to see a large groupe of your fellowcreatures perfectly independent To have all their tears dried up and to make them uninterruptedly happy Suppose I say such a point rested with you at what rate would you purchase it Be ingenuous  Let me seeyou have you say ten thousand pounds ayear why  then I would give precisely  nine thousand five hundred  and if one very hard place yet remained which  another  hundred could smooth I would not stand out for that too The  rest  I would keep in my own hands because I have a right to independence as much as another Didst ever hear such a Simpleton reader  And this you would actually and chearfully do upon your honour  Chearfully and actually upon my honour  Then my dear let us go into the house and see what steps are necessary to  realize  the benevolent project of friend SHENSTONE  What a delicious idea said Matilda with tears in her eyes blessed  be the memory of the charming poet for suggesting the thought and blessed the spirit of my father which carries it into execution  We talked over the matter for two hours and then parted for the night To which fool reader dost thou give preference the father or the child  CHAP V AN ACCOUNT OF THE PROPRIETOR'S STEWARD  REPOSE was banished from the pillow She was chased away as an unwelcome guest Fancy and all her fairy train were admitted in her stead I could not help anticipating my joys and upon meeting Matilda at breakfast I found we had passed the night in the same way It was presently resolved to seek out a convenient spot upon which my village was to be built This Matilda said must be such a retreat as naturally gave scope for all the flourishes of art and nature I enjoyed the gravity  with which she advised me in my choice of ground to take care it commanded verdant walks and winding vallies hills regularly climbing one beyond another with plenty of shade for love and for poetry forests of the thickest gloom for philosophers and water for cascades and for convenience You cannot papa said she be too cautious in this particular for if your village is not well situated and highly embellished it will be impossible to make any thing of it  But although one might allow this embroidery to the gaiety of a girl like Matilda I did not think it decent so to tassel and fringe my  own  ideas being indeed more solicitous about finding a  wholesome  spot than one merely poetical and picturesque  Yet notwithstanding my ardour I soon perceived there would be more heads than one necessary to be summoned The labour of my scheme multiplied as I thought on it and the more I weighed it the more caution and consultation became necessary What would I not have given for the assistance of half a dozen heads as well turned to the airy mechanicks of building castles as myself But I was too well read in the modern history of the heart to suppose my plan would meet general approbation How did I wish that friend  Shenstone  himself was yet alive that I might repair to HalesOwen and turn his paradise of the Leasowes into a village garden How conformable said I would this be to the philanthropic turn of his mind  What a pleasing compliment to raise up a neighbourhood in the way he himself chalked out  Meditating on these points it was long before I could select from the circle of my friends any persons whom I conceived proper to speak to on the subject Matilda had all the favourable dispositions in the world to expend money upon plausible projects but her imagination was too florid and her years too tender to assist me in the actual execution  It was at the time that I was thus undetermined whom to choose for a confident that a man who had been twenty eight years the family steward and whose locks were grown silver in honest servitude made his appearance  before me He was an arch experienced fellow possessed much of that which receives half its merit from a quaint manner and delivery and had so competent a skill in general subjects that he obtained in my parish the nickname of  The Oracle  Some of his qualities would I own have deterred me from disclosing the circumstance to him had not others encouraged me These encouragements were principally the goodness of his heart and the queerness of his humour the first of which induced him to a thousand worthy actions and the second rendered him a most companionable creature He was starch stay'd generous waggish original and odd  But the business which he now came about was favourable to that greater one which rolled in my mind He came to inform me that as the warm weather was now set in my sheep might be SAFELY washed and sheered There is no danger now sir said he of the poor fools catching cold for in troth it always gives me the stomachach whenever I see them ducked head over heels and then sent without their warm coats to shake and shiver in the shade But now sir  now  the closer you clip the cooler Whet the sheers sir whet the sheers  This looked to me like the exact moment of communication and I bid Mr Samuel Sarcasm shut the door and come nearer I took his wrist  Honest Samuel said I you have been very long an ornament to my family and I hope you and your's will continue in it to the latest posterity You must know I have present occasion for your assistance I have thoughts of improving my estate particularly that part which lieth in Wales  If indeed you could bring that to  bear  sir said Samuel you would do something for there is about ten acres of heath on the left side of your plantations and nurseries that disgust me horridly that part of the earth seems to be lazy sir and answereth not the ends of its creation and ten acres of waste is atrocious quite atrocious  Very true what is to be done Samuel  Why sir as it is gone too far for the plough and I believe would not grow much grain I do not know but it might answer well enough for some other purpose Your tenant Turnland who occupies the Leas beyond it tells me there are such a scarcity of houses in that part of Wales that a man of property might venture to build a little  To  build  SamuelPray go on your discourse charms me  I am moreover instructed sir that many huts thereabouts are dropping into decay and that the Welch landlords are in general too poor to rebuild Suppose therefore that you  were to run up a few neat cottages and small farmhouses in this very spot that I speak of depend on it they would lett well and thus we might make the ground grateful to the proprietor perforce  Very true upon my soul Samuel cried I in great rapture and we will call it SHENSTONEGREEN  Call it what you will sir replied Samuel but were I you I would insist on making every foot of land that I had in the world  do its duty  To let ground lie idle because it is naturally indolent is as I take it criminal sir No man should presume to say a thing is barren till he sees it is impossible to make it bring forth  A noble argument Samuel and I can improve it Fetch  Shenstone  Matilda  Shenstone  Volume the second  While Matilda was gone into the library the good steward sat himself coolly down and began his calculation But scarce had he demonstrated twice eight to be sixteen before Matilda came skipping in with Shenstone  Read man said I to Samuel giving him the book and pointing to the passage No sooner had he read it than he laid down the book upon a table and said with a fignificant smileit is fine talking  Well Samuel what do you think of it  I said sir it is fine talking  But suppose one was to  act  in that manner Would it not be pleasing Would it not be carrying the human almost into the divine nature  It would indeed sir it would be doing as one should never be done by and so far it would be exceeding the commands of holy writ which only ordereth us to do unto others as we wish they would do unto us and to wish any man to throw away his money and time in that manner would be atrocious quite atrocious  Samuel Samuel I am resolved upon my scheme and so do not attempt to sneer me out of it I will act according to that advice you have just read and I will have a town of my own for purposes therein mentioned  without delay A town I will build and the name of it shall be SHENSTONEGREEN  Then sir it would be atrocious in me to gainsay it so if you will please to intrust the book to me I will calculate how much you can do with your income in conformity to the gentleman's fancy But under favour sir who might be the projector of this romance  I now showed Samuel the titlepage which stands thus  The Works in Prose and Verse of WILLIAM SHENSTONE Esq with Decorations  Decorations  indeed said Samuel putting the book into his pocket  thy head was well decorated Mr Poet I warrant itThen turning to meI marvel sir this passage should be in  prose  for I will be so bold to say it has all the properties of  poetry  and might very well figure in a fairy tale but sir it is your affair and not mine and it would be therefore atrocious for me to say more  Tomorrow sir added he I will tell you within an hundred of bricks what may be done  In so doing Samuel you will oblige me and in the mean time assure yourself that with the assistance of a deputy thou shalt be steward of  ShenstoneGreen  It sufficeth replied Samuel and so went away  CHAP VI THE PROJECT ADVANCES  IN THIS SHORT CHAPTER THE PROPRIETOR CARRIES THE READER FROM ENGLAND TO WALES  PERFECTLY soothed and satisfied with myself and with my project I coloured the new Arcadia which I was about to raise around me in the most attracting manner The golden age said I shall presently be realized I could almost have shed tears of joy at finding myself able to carry on my scheme as it seemed to deserve namely upon the broadest scale of general benevolence  In the triumph of these prospects the steward again advanced with the paper of calculation in his hand The generous enthusiasm had by this time got so close to my heart that I could scarce bear his method of measuring every thing that was to be done in the matter by the rule of mathematical certainty Friend Samuel said I to him as he deliberately advanced towards me we must not be over exact in this affair We must as it were indulge our tempers in a sort of poetical licencea few thousand pounds one way or other should make no difference in the great cause of communicating joy What though I shall attempt what was never attempted before This will rather  urge me to go on than to desist If therefore you stand too strictly upon the  minutiae  it will distress and not serve me for I have a few odd thousands at my banker's which may serve to make up deficiencies in case of an exigence  Ah would to God said Matilda the village were set fairly about  ShenstoneGreen  What a sweet name  The account stands thus said the steward with infinite phlegm offering a paper  SAMUEL SARCASM'S Calculation for the building peopling and repairing a village on a New Constructionin order TO GIVE AWAY  The sordid title to his account ran so little to my mind that I threw down the paper and resolved to read no further The very idea of such oeconomy shocked  What said I unfeeling Samuel would you think of your master if he was to lavish his whole fortune in the  vices  of ages  I should think sir that he was a very bad man  But since he resolves to improve it in the mannet insinuated what opinion dost thou form of him in that case  That he is better sir than it is  necessary  Pshaw said Matilda I have no patience with such old follows Their feelings are absorbed in the rules of multiplication In the name of  Shenstone  set all hands to work papa and follow the dictates of your own heart in spite of all the stewards in Christendom I should die if you were not to finish  ShenstoneGreen  Enough said replied the steward I see you have made up your mind sir and  I  shall only say further that the job shall oe done as cheap as possible I accept the stewardship because I think I can save at least enough out of the mere brick and mortar business for masonry is atrocious to set up half a dozen of your traders It is sinful sir to waste the tenth part of a tile  Spoke like a saint Samuel said I then no more talking but to work We will set out for Wales tomorrow and when we are arrived there the affair shall be finished out of hand  The sooner sir it is  finished  said Samuel Sarcasm the better for you  Then order the necessary preparations without delay answered I speaking quick  They shall be ordered said Samuel speaking slow  CHAP VII THE PROPRIETOR BUYS A BOOK  THE soul and all its affections were in so glowing and if I may so say so glorious a heat during these preparatory circumstances that there was no time to feel the force of  buts ifs whys wherefores  or any other stops which in a colder moment might bar up a man's passage Passion victoriously leaped over all and disdained to wait for the dampning effects of a prudential or political maxim It was in vain therefore that the steward obliquely threw in my way any hints to detain me any longer in Cumberland I sat up  all night to arrange my affairs there to my inclination I took care that my absence should neither be lamented by the poor nor the rich I put every thing in a fair train of going on smoothly and actually set out with my steward for my estate in Wales at dawning of the day Matilda remained in Cumberland with her cousin who had been many years a part of my family and who was one of those men in whom curiosity of every kind but that which related to dog gun and game was absolutely dead Happy vagabond How was he to be envied  It would have been insupportable to toil through so long a journey had not imagination alleviated the length of the road but with  her  assistance  the milestones were measured and passed without anxiety Though there was in reality nothing on the side of me but the arch muscles of the steward who grinned a silent sarcasm on my scheme in every lineament of his face yet I pictured all that is beautiful and bewitching I stopped at a large markettown to change horses and was struck with the title of a work which hung at a bookseller's window Buy that book for me said I Samuel He did so and we proceeded in our journey  CHAP VIII THE BOOK IS EXAMINED  THIS volume was the "Description of  MilleniumHall  and the country adjacent together with the characters of the inhabitants c" If my fancy was before heated it was upon the reading this performance fairly in flames Not that I approved all the regulations of the Millenium Society or thought the system of benevolence by any means satisfactory but because I was just at that time in the humour to catch avidly at every thing that gave an opportunity to praise my own project and oppose the significant looks of Samuel  The Oracle  But that obstinate mortal was proof against all artillery and did not seem a whit persuaded by the most florid "Description of MilleniumHall" Had the fellow's face been cut in marble it could not have been more pertinaciously fixed and when I came to that part of the performance where the enchanting society assembled together in a spacious hall to pursue each a favourite and elegant amusement he twisted up his rusty fibres into a kind of ludicrous contraction mixing as it were smiles and frowns and said if I would give him leave he would offer his humble opinion upon as much of the book as had been yet read But Mr Samuel's  harangue being a precious relict it deserves to stand alone in a separate chapter It is a most  atrocious  morsel indeed  CHAP IX A PANEGYRIC ON WOMEN AND BOOKS  THE Oracle began with these words I commence with observing sir that books are  atrocious  They are in general so much  above  or  below  life that either way one can expect no truth  Commonsense  is thought too dull and all  other  sense is so useless that I should be glad to know what can keep the presses in employment Why sir nothing but fancy and folly and  fine  sense which I assert once more is  no  sense at all This being my notion of books in general you will judge  what it is of romances in particular Romances sir I define to be of all atrocious things the  most  atrocious because they describe matters that never were and I hope to heaven never  will  be This being the case it follows that very few books ought to be either printed or read and of all books I set down that same MilleniumHall as containing the greatest share of things impossible  Here I frowned  Frown as you will sir it behoves me to say since my opinion is asked I can prove  that  romance to be impracticable in its first setting out Why sir the first principle is  atrocious  Do you think that Miss Mansell and Miss Morgan Lady M Jones Mrs Selvyn Mrs Trentham and all the  other Lady Bountifuls could live together in the same house without  lovers husbands  or  quarrels  Sir sir sir you must be exceedingly atrocious in the knowledge of women not to know that this is altogether out of nature  I bit my lips  That may be sir replied Samuel sticking to his point but I am sure mistakes would every day not to say every  hour  happen to set this  Attic School  as you call it in an uproar I remember very well the pretty postures in which they are described  sitting in the book  but bring them out of that book into real life and I would engage for an alteration If you sir knew the sex when  shut up  together  under the same roof you would be surprised at the impudence of a fellow who would tell you of their living in harmony for such a number of years No no times and seasons would come about if you were  with  them when Mrs Maynard would throw her orrery at Mrs Selvyn who like a true woman would throw her book at Mrs Maynard Mrs Mansell notwithstanding her being the finest form and albeit had beautiful brown hair would toss her Madona at Mrs Trentham's carved figure and away I warrant you would go that same carved work to knock off the beautiful brownhaired Mrs Mansell's Madona  Prithee dear sir if you mean that your new town should last till the  bricks are cemented do not put half a dozen ladies of spirit in any part of it together He paused and then went on  They may do very well sir in a romance like your MilleniumHall but to introduce them upon  ShenstoneGreen  would put all Wales in confusion No no we will build better than that too Our village shall be of another guess constructionNo Maynards and Mansells  This last remark reinstated the sagacious Mr Samuel in perfect favour It looked like giving a little into my project and through that acquiescence were my affections now to be taken  I arrived in due season at my estate and received the homage of  my Welch tenants It was the business of the next morning to inspect the wasteground alluded to and we found it the very best spot in the world for  ShenstoneGreen  Of this you will the better judge when you read the letter I sent my daughter  To  MATILDA BEAUCHAMP  in  CUMBERLAND  I AM just come my dear from taking a survey of the ground that is to be fixed on for  ShenstoneGreen  It exactly suits us At the back are the finest nurseries of woods in Wales it stands on an eminence it is almost an oval and the green which struggles through the thistles is a sort of velvetmost No carpet  was ever softer Springs of living water come issuing from the adjacent mountains and there is an abundance of game in the vallies Add to which it is on my private estate so that houses and lands will be essentially created out of my own property Samuel is writing for builders and we shall have both men and money without loss of time You shall come soon Mean while  I am Your most affectionate father BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP  It is almost incredible to conceive how soon Samuel collected hands The sons of the trowel poured in on  every side from every quarter and though Wales is not very favourable to materials for villagebuilding I soon saw that money would enable me to make a city instead of a country town  CHAP X THE EFFUSIONS OF ENTHUSIASM  I Remember nothing ever pleased me so thoroughly as the figure physiognomy and behaviour of the person who came down in his own carriage to me in the capacity of schemer There was a great deal of architecture in all his features He looked too as if he could build up and pull down exactly in a manner the most pleasing to his employers Certainly never was proprietor better suited with a projector  He no sooner examined the ground than he protested it was  capable of every thing  For the sake of society  he advised the form of the village to be circular and so making a ring he gave directions to fix the line for twentyfive boxes equidistant leaving space for garden before and behind The traders cottages were to lie at some little distance in a separate quarter In the centre was to be a pedestal and statue erected to the memory of  Shenstone  there was to be a parish church and the houses were to be accurately alike In short there was to be every thing that could charm the sight or the senses on  ShenstoneGreen  Such was the schemer's dispatch that he was ready for the rest of the artificers in a trice and all hands went merrily to work No language  can express the trembling joy with which I laid  myself  the first stone and brick for the building of  ShenstoneGreen  In the very instant it was doing I considered myself as about to raise a  Temple to Generosity  The quantity of beef and beer given away on this occasion might have deluged the honesty of five hundred freeholders at an English election The artificers told me that unless the ground was well watered or to speak more properly well  beered  no future crops of felicity were to be expected To prevent therefore all misfortunes of this nature carpenters masons and even the schemer himself got so thoroughly intoxicated for the future honour and prosperity of  ShenstoneGreen  that until three days after the  debauch not a finger could wag in the way of its profession  In due time however the hour of sobriety returned and I had the pleasure to see every body in earnest Help me to describe the bliss ye children of Hope and Imagination ye who have built  your  castles in the cloudshelp to say how I rejoiced at the prospect of so much generous labour More than fifty times aday did I walk round and round the space allotted for the village stopping awhile at every ten yards to indulge the effusions of my enthusiasm  Here  perhaps said I in this spot may by and by reside one of my best friends now pining in poverty On this barren heath which hath hitherto resounded  only with the noise of goats shall echo the happy conversation of human beings Flowers shall usurp the place now occupied by brambles and even religion shall move with sainted steps over MY GREEN  Though it was difficult to pass over the bricks the lime and the mortar I congratulated myself very heartily on such little embarrassments This confusion said I touching my steward on the shoulderthis confusion Samuel arises not from the desolation of conquest The heaps of rubbish which impede our passage  here  are not created by the ruins of some fair city which hath fallen the victim of a military fury who magnifies  murther into patriotismNo Mr Steward every brick that you now behold shall be presently converted to the purposes of benevolence Those waggons are laden with the materials of future happiness Love and friendship shall flourish in the little temples that are raised from thence and I look therefore with a kind of veneration on the very horses that are thus engaged in the service of  ShenstoneGreen  Though a little frenzy reader might then touch me was I not to be envied  The horses sir said Samuel are very much obliged to you so if you please we will withdraw to the mansionhouse where I have something to show your Honour  With all my heart honest Samuel said I with all my heart A child might have led me at discretion  CHAP XI A PROJECT DESTROYED BY A LAUGH  THE mansionhouse to which we were then retiring stood about a mile to the right of the future  ShenstoneGreen  It was  there  that I lodged my workmen the house being extremely commodious till their labours should be completed and we had no sooner got within sight of the building than Samuel stopped short to lean on his stick and beg I would look about me  Sir said he a thought strikes me Behold the venerable seat of your forefathers none of whom ever had any notion of dipping themselves up  to the very neck in mortar as you are about to do Your ancestors sir lived in this house which is almost a town of itself Now sir as  you  do not choose to live like your ancestors but are resolved atrociously resolved to introduce things that were never before heard of I presume to hope you will have no objection to go the cheapest way to work  Certainly Mr Sarcasm said I  That being the case sir replied Samuel you have now an opportunity to save a world of money  Here he held out his stick  That building is surely large enough sir to fill with families that do not properly belong to you There is  sufficient room within that edifice to make a pretty expensive tryal of your project  Well and what then Mr Samuel Sarcasm said I I could freely have taken his stick to thrash him  Why then Sir Benjamin Beauchamp replied he I would humbly advise that you turn out all the men horses bricks and other  materials of benevolence  from  ShenstoneGreen  and suffer kine to browse the thistle and to nip the grass till you see whether it  answers  to proceed It will be time enough to enlarge sir when this goodly mansion is filled to your mind  I was on the edge of a reply to this proposal when the projector  came running to acquaint me of a new improvementI immediately told him of Samuel's plan and did not fail to mix it up with a decent degree of ridicule  The projector burst into such an immoderate degree of laughter that I could not help joining him and Samuel coughed again with color There was more wisdom and goodness in Samuel's cough than the projector's laughter  CHAP XII CONTAINING A CURIOUS ADVERTISEMENT  BUT this sir said the steward recovering himself this is not the business I was going to talk of Please to come with me into the mansionhouse and I will show you I have not been idle in pushing on the project of  ShenstoneGreen  So far contrarywise that I have been employing myself as serviceably as Mr Projector himself though it must be owned I am not so merry  This put me again into good humour A man of my temper and engaged in my way is always pleased  if you do but flatter the parts which most deserve to be censured I walked into the house with the very person who had before offended me  arm in arm  Pity the infirmity of a castlebuilder reader and proceed  My friend Samuel put a paper into my hand and desired my opinion In the full assurance of receiving pleasure I opened it and read what follows  ADVERTISEMENT I  WANTED as many lazy and unfortunate people as can properly fill twenty or thirty houses of three rooms on a floor  N B The houses will be on a new plan  ADVERTISEMENT II  WHEREAS a welldisposed gentleman aged fifty and sound in mind having an only daughter who dispises money and ten thousand pounds to throw away in charitable  abuses  hereby gives notice to the public  that  he is making a town for the good of mankind with all possible dispatch and humbly invites every body who have neither house or home to hold themselves in readiness as they may depend upon hearing further the moment things are fit for their reception Such  miserables  therefore as choose to be well lodged and to enjoy an irrevocable salary of two hundred pounds  per annum  for life without paying lot or scot will please to send in their names real and fictitious as well as places of present abode whether in garrets or cellars that a proper quantum of soap and clean linen may be transmitted to their several apartments prior to their appearance before the worthy gentleman who is at the whole cost of the scheme  N B Broken limbs hump backs bandied legs and all other infirmities whether of flesh or bone internal or external will be esteemed so many  additional recommendations  It is therefore requested that candidates will never think themselves unqualified but repair to  ShenstoneGreen  on stilts stumps and all manner of other ingenious contrivances whatsoever God save the welldisposed gentleman  This was such a reflexion on the more noble views of my soul that I considered the steward too abject at that time for my resentment and therefore collecting together all the coolness of philosophy even in the midst of a poetical pursuit I told him I thought his advertisements were just what I expected from  his elegant  pen and that the sooner he committed them to the press the better I believe Samuel was piqued at my taking his sarcasm so tranquilly for he turned upon his heel with an abruptness that at once denoted anger  and disappointment My fortitude on this occasion however had so good an effect that Mr Samuel dropped his importunities from that moment for at least two days  CHAP XIII THE PROPRIETORS WEAKNESS AND SINGULARITY  IN the mean time the builders went briskly on and in a few months a very goodly show of houses began to promise the future completion of my hopes No sooner did the heath begin to assume the look of a town than I surveyed it with selfcongratulation As I never suffered my imagination to be cooled either by the idea of expence or by the sarcastic strokes of my steward it kindled every day into more ardour and I very well remember my heart was so full when I saw the project nearly concluded that I retired into  a shady walk which some adjacent poplars afforded me and burst into tears  Ah what a voluptuous moment Ah what tears were these represent to yourself reader a man whose fancy was embellished with the most exalted and amiable views  Well said I it is now time to look about me I have made a village How pleasing the axe the chissel and mallet echo one another there is something generous in the sound Scarce had this idea passed before I beheld one of the workmen dragging along a sledge with freestone and marble ready polished for the inferior parts of some of my buildings The big drops of labour  coursed down his forehead and at every dozen yards he stopped a little to breathe and to gather strength As the next pause he made was within a few paces of me I saw plainly his situation The veins of his face and neck seemed to distend with the force of pullingthe muscles of an athletic man looked to be bursting It is amazing to think what I felt Poor fellow said I advancing thou art a good soul I am sure at the same time my heart urged me to carry my handkerchief to his forehead and to wipe away the sweat  "I could have hugged the greasy rogue He pleased me" reader  As to that master said the labourer it don't signify I always  sweats but if your Honour would give us a drop of the dear creature I should like it much better than a wipe of the face with a white hankerchief Odds bobs sir we have a heavy batch of business at the  Green  yonder  The dear creature shall be much at your service as soon as I can fetch it from the mansionhouse but at present a little rest will be not amiss so sit down under these trees and let us talk  By chance I had in a sidepocket a halfpint flask of cordials which I sometimes carried in case of accidents like the present Before the preceding speech therefore was finished I recollected this circumstance and produced it to view The change in the  man's features at sight of the flask was remarkable enough Lord sir said he licking his lips what a good gentleman you aredon't you find it  nation  hot sir Oh what a pleasant sight is one of your narrownecked gluck glucking gentry when a man is adry  I gave him the bottle which was in a moment glued to his lips and after he had drank he sat upon the grass and the following conversation passed between us  Sir said the man shaking the brickdust from his shirt I have long wished for the honour of talking with you and I am glad through your Honour's goodness that I have got this opportunity I am poor but honest  Speak freely  honest  friend then  Why then sir about this same  ShinstunGreen  Is it really a  factotum  that you are putting yourself to all this charge for other folks The talk goes amongst the masons and bricklayers that you design to give away house and land and money almost to any man that is poor and honest  The report is true  And won't you really think better on't and give them the bite sir Will your Honour go thorough stitch with this affair  Why should you doubt me  Becase  sir I have my reasons  Name them  Why here have I been mason's man and master mason going on of twenty years and worked in that time for gentle and simple yet never heard of such an honourable man as your Honour in my life Look ye sir our business goes on in a regular channel A man comes to me and says Master Hewit or Henry or Mr Henry Hewit I want a house built or a wall run up or some such matter Upon that I takes my bag of worktools and goes to the place where I finishes my jobb for so much the piece or so much the day But first I tries to get as much as I can for my work and my employer tries on his side to get my work as cheap as possible My bargain being once struck I must abide by it and let  the sun burn my guts out not a nogging of drink  extra  would be given to save'em  Drink friend pray drink  Discourse to be sure heats so here's to your extraordinary Honour's health Well sir jobb being finished we separate my master pays me growlingly and goes into the house I have built Now here lies the difference you give us all our own fair price and pay chearfully for  extra  and instead of going into the house yourself you clap in a family who shall perhaps be found skulking under the hedges Odds bobs sir if a poor body should but make water against the walls of  other  people that I have worked foryes and substantial  folks toowhew they would be sent to prison directly  That is cruel  Cruel your Honourwhy I tell you you are a nonsuch I am a good judge Look ye sir I was building up Sir James Ranter's chimneypiece and a block of marble fell and lent me such a sliver as broke my armthere's a scar for you Well I got two shillings for this stroke from Sir James and two and twenty damns from the masterbricklayer who therewithal discharged me for being careless But when I think of this sir my tongue cleaves to the roof of my mouth with revenge it really makes me dry again One little drop more if you please sir  With pleasuredrink heartily  And so sir you  will  act in contradiction to all the world You will be a friend to the friendless  I will  Then am I a sad scoundril to waste my time here in talking when I might be better employed saving your Honour's remarkable presence and when the sooner the work is done the better  Saying this the man rose up abruptly made his bows and ran off with his sledge of marble blocks as if they were so many feathers  A mighty action I shall make of it after all said I here is a poor fellow who labours in the cause and wishes to finish the work though his  own interest depends on its continuance  As I reflected on this matter I regretted that a long  habit of doing nothing i e  living like a gentleman had made it impossible for me to work myself and pay others at the same time  So then said I all the merit I can claim upon this occasion is making a decent use of a large fortune which came to me by inheritance without any effort on my part From this moment I looked on the multitude of workmen which were variously employed as more solid benefactors than myself Whether I ever had reason to change my opinion will be seen presently All things in their order  CHAP XIV MORE WEAKNESS AND AN EXTRAORDINARY PETITION  THERE are singularities in my character which at different times produced great pleasure and pain As I now passed by the files of labourers each earnest in his occupation I felt for them a genuine respect that led me incontinently to take off my hat and even bow to several as I went along This must have seemed ludicrous enough for I perceived every man suspending his work and looking at me with astonishment How sacred are the silliest customs  It was not without some astonishment too on my part that I saw Mr Samuel the steward appear before me the next morning with a very dismal countenance to tell me of a whisper that was running amongst the workmen not much to my advantage 'Tis really supposed sir said he that you are a little injured herepointing to his forehead  Mad Samuel  No no sir not absolutely mad for in that case it would not be proper you should go about only as it were shook or shattered a little at top  Is it possible Samuel  Most veritable and they go so far as to tell me you was seen yesterday  running up to a man and to rub the dust off his face with your handkerchief whether he would or no after which you made him sit down by you crack jokes tell a story and such fancies then having amused yourself sufficiently you fairly fuddled him with a quart bottle of Geneva and sent him reeling away To finish the whole the report goes that you were seen to come in a moody manner upon the  Green  and casting up your eyes in a strange staring way took your  hat  off your head and bowed about on both sides of you sometimes to men sometimes to horses and sometimes to mortar as if you were crazy  Ridiculous Samuel Too ridiculous to be attended to  I have as steward a duty to discharge sir which perhaps may convince you to the contrary Pray read that paper sir  The  HUMBLE PETITION  of the  MASONS CARPENTERS BRICKLAYERS CARVERS  and  OTHERS  in Common Council assembled  To  SIR BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP KNIGHT  and  BARONET  SHOWETH THAT your petitioners are honest men and good workmen and would not take advantage of any gentleman's  infirmity  willingly  THAT they are in great forwardness with a new town called  ShenstoneGreen  the intent of building which very much surprizes your petitioners who never heard of  giving away  a  whole town before  THAT your petitioners believe your Honour to be a worthy gentleman and as free with your money as we are with lime and mortar but that your petitioners have seen such things in your Honour as  they cannot make out  THAT your Honour hath pulled your  hat  off to your humble petitioners who never had so much honour done them before when at work  THAT your Honour hath been seen to give half a crown to a boy who turned a barrow full of new bricks into a ditch because you said he poor thing must suffer for the misfortune more than the price of the bricks  THAT your Honour has been heard to talk very much and very loud to  yourself  and choose for this purpose dark lanes gloomy corners and unfrequented places such indeed as your petitioners would upon all occasions save  one occasion  assiduously avoid  THAT your petitioners have heard your Honour making strange noises and holding long discourses in the night and have been earwitness  many and sundry times to the words My head is giddymy heart is in flamesmy soul is on fireO SHENSTONE SHENSTONE SHENSTONE c c c  THAT one of your petitioners being the other day on the opposite side of the hedge looked through the twigs thereof and saw your Honour  weeping  after which your Honour began to  smile  and to assure the trees you were a great deal  too happy  THAT your Honour diverted yourself two hours with making one of your humble petitioners dead drunk with drinking drams  THAT putting together all these circumstances with some others which  give them additional force your petitioners humbly apprehend your Honour is subject to fits that may hurry you into schemes of which you may repent while they are carrying into execution Your petitioners pray to know whether this is the case in regard to  ShenstoneGreen  because if it were they jointly agree to give up their jobb and compromise for the cost of labour they have been already at  THAT if it is thus your Honour had better stop in time for to confess the truth we look on your Honour's taking off your  hat  as much as to say  Pretty gentlemen you are picking my pocket here finely  Your erecting a town  to make a present of  we humbly conceive to be  out of the question  being an affair that will not hold water Your rewarding the boy for destroying the hundred of bricks we imagine was ironically given and by way of sneer as much as to say  The sooner my lad you do my business by completing my ruin the better  Your getting into nooks and corners talking to yourself c we apprehend to be on account of your Honour's unwillingness to send us off the premises your laughing and crying in the same breath frightens us almost out of our wits and your Honour's pleasing to make one of us drunk we consider in no other way than that you wished him to send the sledge of marble  after the barrow of bricksWe your petitioners therefore alarmed by these desperate symptoms do most humbly beseech and intreat that your Honour will explain yourself to us and tell us what is to be done Do this and your petitioners shall for ever pray c c  My hand trembled all the time I read this petition but resolved to treat it as a jest at least in the presence of Samuel I affected to smile and demanded who might be the penman of this pleasant thing Little Phil Flourish the carver sir said Samuel He is a wit you know  That being the case Samuel said I pray take this half guinea to the wit and tell him from me to put the petition into as handsome a frame as possible and do you hear let the glazier give it the additional decoration of a glass  Samuel took the paper and the half guinea and walked off in such a manner as convinced me he was both chagrined and disappointed  CHAP XV INTRODUCES AN ODDITY  IN about two hours after an odd figure of a man with a rusty wig and fulltrimmed clothes about three parts worn and one part torn came scraping his foot and bending his body into my apartment and said he had the honour to be admitted into the best families in Wales  And will you favour me with your wrist good sir said he  Willinglysaid I  Tiiihiwe are all in a hurryhard at work hard at work  sir You have the pulse of a runninghorse after his course Lack aday lack adayhow is your headWhy the temples project sirput out your tonguewhite as limemilk milk milk milk  Pray sir who may I have the pleasure to converse with  Edward Elixir sir apothecary surgeon midwife and physician occasional at your service c c c  And what is your opinion of my case Mr Edward Elixir apothecary surgeon c And pray who told you that your abilities were requisite at my house Mr Edward Elixir surgeon apothecary c  Mr Philip Flourish the carver sir he came to me about an hour ago as I was eradicating a tooth of Taff Toughjaw my neighbour Sir said he I come to you in behalf of our patron at the mansionhouse We have some reasons which would be no secrets were we to tell them to an apothecaryYou know Mr Flourish I suppose sirWe have some reasons to think he our patron is not quite in good health He seems to us  mazed  Upon this he went away and I gave my word and honour to make you well without delay But do I not see the toe of a nasty consumption under your left eye Take care consumption little Edward is at hand  Here he closed the lids and examined  Ahahhave I got thee Sir  that  consumption will I lay as flat as my forceps before it gets an inch forwarder Sir there is not a disorder incident to man but is naturally and artificially afraid of Edward Elixir It is a Welch proverb nowadays to say in case of a dangerous distemper  Elixir Ned Shall strike thee dead  Pray Mr Elixir said I does the poet here mean the distemper or the patient which is to be knocked dead  Well now if I could not die of laughing at the divine conceit of  thatif I could not may pestilence get the better of me How I do love to laughcurse it and consume it how I do love to laugh I wish sir you had time to hear my history I tell my history to every patient Ha ha ha ha he he he  They are  patients  in good truth Mr Elixir  I swear by my scissars you will kill me sir if you go on in that manner Wit tickles me worse than the point of a feather Ha ha ha ha ha he heBright bright bright bright bright  "Immoderate laughing says the proverb is catching" I joined the apothecary very heartily without being able to assign any other reason  than that of seeing a little comical man in happy convulsions  When you recover Mr Elixir said I you will return to my consumption  When I  recover  Jesus Jesus there's another blow at my poor lungs and sides Ha ha ha ha ha ha When I  recover  Why sir your distemper seems to be a superabundant humour of wit How I do love to laugh But to return Physically speaking then how do you find yourself  Physically answering I am morally sick of your foolery Lookee Mr Elixir my workmen and that Flourish you speak of have played me a prank I do not approve and if  you  are made a party in it I shall be very much dispeased  The Welchman's face changed in a moment and he protested he was a man of no skill if he knew any thing more of the matter than the carver had told him and whose words he had already repeated  Upon the credit of this I let him into the whole story making him at the same time acquainted with all my designs views and passions in regard to  ShenstoneGreen  I had no sooner finished my discourse than this unaccountable man jumped six or seven inches from his chair skipped about the room as skippeth a goat over the mountains and then shaking my hand till we  were both red in the face he caught up his hat without saying a syllable and set off from the house on the full stretch running over the hills like a rabbit  If thou goest by the way of  ShenstoneGreen  said I to myself and if peradventure any of the workmen see thee then will they swear the doctor is ten times madder than the patient  This prophecy was really fulfilled for in less than three quarters of an hour a party of the builders armed with the instruments of their trade had caught up the miserable apothecary and were escorting him to the mansionhouse that  there  measures might be taken to send him home to his family in peace  I no sooner appeared at the door in order to enquire the cause of this singular confusion than the disastrous surgeon began to skip and bound and snap his fingers over his head and sing forth his Welch ditties with more vigour than ever but what was at that time more ridiculous still the workmen seemed to stand aloof as if afraid to advance  At length Mr Philip Flourish the carver and the wit marched forwards to the head of the troop and in a violent voice for he was occasional a comedian harangued as follows  Friends and fellowworkmen  SUFFER me to tell in the best language I am able wherefore we are assembled  Noble Sir Benjamin Beauchamp you are our patron and therein do we bear unto you respect Hear me therefore for my cause and do you carpenters and joiners be silent that I may be heard Censure me in your wisdom sir and awaken those senses which we fear you have lost that you may the better judge If there be any in this assembly that is the dear friend of Sir Benjamin Beauchamp to him I say that Phil Flourish's love to Sir Benjamin is no less than his If then that friend demand why Brutus I mean Philip Flourish rose against our Caesar that is to say Sir Benjamin Beauchamp this in the name of all the workmen is my answerNot that we loved Sir Benjamin less but that we  love our honour more As Sir Benjamin loves us I weep for him as he is throwing away his fortune I am sorry for it as he is a worthy gentleman I honour him but as he seems to be out of his own senses and can put other folks as this poor apothecary for instance out of their's we are afraid to come near him Thus sir there are fears for your loss of wits honour for your goodness and sorrow for your situation Who's here so base that would not work for Sir Benjamin Beauchamp Who's here so rude that would pick his pocket Who's here so vile that does not pity this poor apothecary I pause for a reply  Mr Philip Flourish having finished his harangue in the tragic style I  learned from a less rhetorical quarter  i e  from the lips of Mr Samuel Sarcasm that the present noise had been occasioned by the conduct of Mr Edward Elixir who on his departure from the mansionhouse ran upon the  Green  and jumped about saying such extravagant things about my generosity my wit and my fine sense accompanying all these assertions with such jestures as very fairly gave reason for the workmen to imagine there was something  contageous  in my disorder the worst part of which had been as they presumed caught by the apothecary  To crush all these fooleries and false suggestions by one decisive stroke I took up the whole affair  on very serious ground and insisted on being attended to  I represented this to the gentlemen as very ill behaviour With regard to their petition I observed that I was willing to see it in the most favourable light but whatever I had done or might do depended on my own pleasure for which I chose to pay in proportion That  their  part of the business was peaceably to pursue each man his particular avocation till the work was finished That it was  impertinent  to enquire for what particular use I raised up to myself a town It was for them to do  so much work  agreeable to my directions for  so much money  and that if I chose  to build a palace for a parcel of horses and put my friends in a pigstye it was wholly my affair and not theirs The apothecary Mr Elixir had been I observed sent by Mr Flourish on a foolish errand namely to cure a man who was in perfect health and that as to his jumping about for joy in talking of me it might be partly from the vivacity of his constitution and partly from the goodness of his heart at hearing there was a man who had the  courage  to proceed in erecting a town to serve the Unfortunate when it was found to be so very contrary to the sordid maxims of the world that even the workmen were up in arms  This being a full explanation I added that I expected matters would go on regularly for the future and that they would so far enlarge their hearts as to pursue their duty with a diligent chearfulness and that while they  were  pursuing it they should not think the worse of their patron's understanding for acting by them more generously than some of their former employers  The passions of a mob are never fixed These silly people now ran into the other extreme and were by the foregoing speech so fully satisfied that I was unanimously extolled as a paragon of sense and solid learning as charitable beyond the reach of instances and as the  best master that ever was worked for  Hereupon they released the apothecary of whom they demanded many pardons and then after giving me three cheers they went hastily away convinced I was in full possession of my senses and that they would now go to work for me like so many devils  CHAP XVI THE PROJECT BECOMES POPULAR  THUS was every thing accommodated and  ShenstoneGreen  went on more briskly than ever In truth every man appeared to do his utmost and the progress of this united effort became in a short time so apparent that my village assumed a regularity and splendour which attracted the curiosity of the adjacent counties Sir Benjamin's  new town  was a popular subject and the echo of his good intentions reverberated from shire to shire  Amongst others who had particularly contributed to this popularity  was the little Welch doctor mentioned in the last chapter This man was so struck with the novelty of the project that he took care to blazon it forth through all the families into which his loquacity or his skill could gain him access and a talkative creature of his character and profession in a dull part of the world too where a little runabout thing skips from mountain to mountain to pick up news is always welcome in one sense or another By such means therefore I was at once celebrated and delighted for I will not attempt to conceal the satisfaction I received from this innocent flattery and it so endeared to me Mr Elixir whom I looked upon as in a great measure the source of it that I cultivated his  acquaintance and had him with me at the mansionhouse almost every evening  Now then it was that I began to think my scheme in sufficient forwardness to give the finer and more affectionate finishes The houses being nearly completed I imagined it time to think about getting them occupied and in the mean time I gave directions for such embellishments in point of gardening as might leave nothing undone that could add elegance to convenience At an incredible charge I enriched a land naturally unfruitful till it was flowing with fragrance and breathing perfume Roses jessamines pinks honeysuckles and lillies embroidered every  part and in the space of six months after the rubbish was removed it would have been difficult to find in any part of Europe a spot more agreeably cultivated or more adorned with beauties artificial and natural than  ShenstoneGreen  This then was the period to bring down first my daughter and then such of my friends as I thought would be most happy in such an asylum  Paradise  is here  regained  said I  Matilda in consequence of these resolutions was with me in a few days and the emotions of her surprize on her first sight of  ShenstoneGreen  does so much honour to human nature of which she is an ornament  and of her father who doats upon her that it would rob the reader of entertainment not to give them in her own language just as they were conveyed in a letter to a lady who afterwards became and indeed is to this hour a pensioner  To Miss  ELIZA ELLIOT  WELL dear Eliza the last polishes are now giving to  The Green  I am just come from a first view and from walking round the enchanting circuit The soul of  Shenstone  and of Sir  Benjamin  shines through every part I was in this very spot about two summers ago and remember it was impassible by means of weeds and  nettles It is now burnished with buildings and blooming with flowers The great beauty of the place  simply  considered is suffcient to gratify the most delicate taste but when one adds thereto the generous purposes for which that beauty has been preparing and considers it is designed to be a paradise for distressed virtue in every form for merit superciliously over looked and for genius which is spurned by ignorance its value rises so on the imagination that one is perfectly dazzled I am sure I am so to the greatest degree The idea is so delicious so peculiar so uncommon There is nothing now wanting but the furniture I do not mean chairs glasses tables  for those will be here in a few days and are already ordered but that  nobler  furniture of honest minds and generous hearts made respectable by calamity and sacred from their misfortunes Amongst these my dear Elliot is invited as a valuable guest She is invited to enjoy the independence and serenity which she hath a right to claim and which has so long been her due I have already my dear selected for you a house it is embosomed by lillies and roses that almost emulate your own complexion It is in that quarter which lies nearest to the wood and will therefore be less liable to the cold air and make it more agreeable  for walking Here my Elliot shall forget to sigh or if that cannot be her sighs shall be buried in the bosom of a friend Do not fear that any wrong curiosity shall be set to work to extort from you that profound secret which you so firmly resolve to conceal It will not be a maxim at  ShenstoneGreen  to oblige with one hand and violate with the other It is to be a sanctuary where innocence neglected and worth abused is to find absolute  independence  Come then my dear come in the full security of being as private as you can wish To share your anxiety it is only necessary to see it To explore the cause too critically where it is purposely  veiled from the view would be ungenerous Fear nothing therefore but hasten to Sir Benjamin and to  Your most affectionate friend MATILDA BEAUCHAMP  ShenstoneGreen  CHAP XVII PETITION THE SECOND  ON the evening in which this letter was written and sent by a servant to the posttown the steward came once more into my room with his sarcastical face just as Matilda and I were in high chitchat upon the charms of our project and begged an audience  Speak Samuel said I gayly What another petition I suppose  Sir replied Samuel my office obliges me to lay before you such things as come to hand upon the subject of  ShenstoneGreen  At present I bear  a petition it must be confessed but it moves upon so different a principle and is indeed in so different a style being altogether a panegyric on your Honour's project that I conceive it will have a different reception from the last  Mr Samuel said I if it is in praise of a project which I think cannot well be blamed I desire to hear it and as I know you are not more of an  oracle  than an  orator  pray sit down and bestow on it all the graces of your delivery  Grey locks are no securities against the force of flattery which we swallow upon almost any terms even when the preparation is but bunglingly made up Thus though this  compliment was equivocal and equally admitted an interpretation of praise and censure Mr Samuel Sarcasm old and arch and white headed as he was took it in the most soothing sense and was put into perfect good humour  Now for it cried Matilda  Samuel unfolded a paper which as usual he had plaited very methodically and sitting down in front exerted himself in giving all possible emphasis to what follows  The Second Humble Petition of the Carpenters Masons Bricklayers Carvers Gilders Glaziers Scourers Painters Gardeners Whitesmiths Blacksmiths and Brownsmith  in Common Council assembled Superscribed to  A very large and respectable body Mr Samuel said I a little interrupting him  What can they possibly have to say cried Matilda  Superscribed said Samuel reading on to the most worthy worshipful sensible sober happy hospitable generous and gentlemanly Sir Benjamin Beauchamp Knight Baronet and so forth greeting  This indeed said I pretending to be pleased is in a strain of lofty eulogium that merits hearing and a bottle of good port to whet the  whistle of the orator into the bargain  And I will fetch it said Matilda getting up at the same time and taking a bottle and glasses from a corner sideboard  Samuel proceeded  HUMBLY SHOWETH  THAT your petitioners ask ten thousand pardons for ever having supposed you were hurt in your senses but assure your Honour they judged only from the difficulty they had to believe any man in his right reason could be a friend to those whom almost all the world agree to despise and whom they therefore thought  could not be countenanced without shame and disgrace  THAT your petitioners are now so thoroughly convinced of your Honour's sound intellect that they wish God Almighty had rather given them the power to  imitate  your example than to censure it  THAT perceiving the town of  ShenstoneGreen  now just upon finishing is to all intents and purposes erected for all who are poor or dispirited without regard to birth or connexions they humbly address your Honour to take into consideration the case of them and their families  THAT your petitioners are most of them it is true in possession of  their limbs but that they are obliged for the most part to get their bread by the sweat of their brows and have all the good will in the world to live the rest of their days like gentlemen upon a pension of two hundred pounds ayear  per annum  THAT your petitioners would like much to live in the houses they have built and beautified and that as they believe your Honour now you have done with mortar may want  men  they do humbly propose in order to save a great deal of trouble as well as to give an opportunity of another good action that they and their wives and children may take possession of the place commonly called  ShenstoneGreen  situate lying and being upon a heath in the country  of Wales in that part of it commonly called Glamorganshire  We the undersigned being those who have most hand in this petition do most humbly pray

gave way to her youth and  laughed so heartily that even the rigid muscles of the steward were more than once put to trial  But as the petition was in itself serious I was about to signify my answer to Mr Sarcasm who drank his glass of wine and waited for it with inexpressible gravity when in came the apothecary with a letter which he told me had just come to his hand  It was addressed To Mr Sir Benjamin Beauchamp who built  ShenstoneGreen  and it contained these words  Mr Sir  BENJAMIN  or Mr Sir  BEAUCHAMP  I AM no scribe as you see but I am a man that scorns a mean action as much as he who can  write a better hand I understand as how to night my fellowworkmen are come to a resolution to send you a petition for to get  ShenstoneGreen  into their own hands This I take to be wrongso I sit down to tell you they are all except John Sawe able to get their bread without begging it and as I am sure you may hit upon folks more  misfortunate  than they who are hale hearty men I hopes your Honour won't go for to disgrace yourself by harbouring such lazy drones who may keep out the honest bees that would work to make honey if they could I beg pardon for this trouble I give you but I do it because I would not see a gentleman's kindness abused  and because I know if your Honour was to give an inch they would take an ell They are not worth much  now  and if they were to have good houses and jump into good fortunes they would be sit for nothing No no choose for yourself There is woe enough lying about here and there that may make your heart ach and in my notion those who make the least noise and who are almost ashamed to show their misery are the men and women for your money I know they should be for mine and so no more at this present writing from your Honour's loving and grateful friend and  Humble servant HENRY HEWITthat's my name  POSTASCRIPT  LEST your Honour should not know me by my name I am the man whose face your Honour wiped when I was sledging the marble and about whom so many lies were told They were jealous about wiping the face of such a poor fellowthat's all  HENRY HEWIT  Upon my reading this epistle the effects of its sentiment operated variously upon the various auditors  Matilda begged leave to withdraw She had it seems a sudden pain of the head  Samuel coughed and said he wished he had not changed his new  half a crown because when a man chose to make a present it was his opinion that half a crown was infinitely superior in point of grace which I can assure you he much studiedtwo shillings and sixpence it looked he said like slitting the favour into three parts The half crown had he thought more dignity  I felt a something for my part flutter about my heart as much as to say mark down that man for  ShenstoneGreen  But Mr Edward Elixirhow shall I describe properly the feelings of thee Mr Edward Elixir If reader you recollect how heartily this man laughed in the fifteenth chapter you will have some notion of the hearty  manner in which he wept on the present occasion His sorrow was as violent as his joy and as he skipped about in many antick postures for no chair could keep him sitting while he was under the influence of his feelings he called goats and gods to witness that if that man's cottage should be visited by all the plagues of Egypt he would drive them all out  gratis  Yes said he I am a glass bottle if I would not bleed bolus and blister a dog which belonged to that fellow for nothing yea though I lost half my payingcustomers in the mean time Jesus how I do love to cry how I do love to cry  If reader this apothecary is not now as dear to thee as he then was  and still is to me then would I advise thee to lay down this volume and take up any other that goeth less into the tender parts of the human character  Please to intrust me with that same Henry Hewit's letter sir said Samuel the steward and it shall be read to the workmen as your reply for dismissing them and their petition  Do so Samuel I replied and bring Henry Hewit before me The steward set off faster than I ever saw him move before  CHAP XVIII MR ELIXIR THE APOTHECARY RELATES THE HEADS OF HIS STORY  FEW evenings of any life were passed more agreeably than that which succeeded the receipt of Henry Hewit's well intended letter The apothecary staid the whole night and enlivened the conversation by such sallies as those who do not well know the immense variety there is in human character can form no idea Sir said he I will not say you shall make a  Shenstonian  of me because though I do very well to hop over the hills I am afraid I should make a silly figure with a good house and two hundred ayear unless indeed you  would give me the business of the  Green  in the way of my profession in which case Death should not often show his ugly face I warrant him but however as we have half an hour to spare I will let you a little into the light of my present situation  This was extremely acceptable to us and Mr Elixir began I had never a regular education sir and my parents went to heaven before I commenced the practice of physic otherwise they might perhaps have been living upon earth stillbut they lost that blessing for want of my not being born sooner I was at first a corncutter and from thence I got the secret for curing swelled ancles Whiteswellings in the knee were the things which  next celebrated mefor away flew the tumours at the touch of my emolient My next advance was to relieve ladies in certain circumstances and some of the finest persons in Wales are of my bringing forth After this I formed and invented a medicine which removed all pains of the stomach back and loins which nostrum was I soon perceived equally good for soreness in the breast In the next step I invented a lenient to take wax and cornels from the neck Then I sent away coughs Then I conquered the toothach and lastly I found out the invaluable art of making the hair grow Thus sir in regular process and progress I mounted by the mere force of application and strong natural abilities from the heel to the head and now  thank God I am at the head of my professionfor I as often prescribe as make up not between ourselves that I think my genius for physic hath half so good an effect upon my patients as my humour and my good nature for I am one of those but I must not tell to the world you knowI am one of those who think half the maladies of mankind arise from melancholy and that nature is in generous tempers generally to be laughed out of her megrims Thus I make it a rule to give innocent thingsthat is to say I deal altogether in  simples  and made the patient forget his pain as much as possible But there is one part of my character which has always stood in my way Whenever I see people in real misery  I have not been able to keep my countenance but fall incontinently to weeping just as I did at Hewit's letter in which distress I have so much satisfaction that though it makes me as lean and meagre as one of my skeletons I am more contented than a prince On the other hand I have very often an opportunity to bring up my flesh again by contrary emotions for if either by stratagem or by nature I can once set my patients to laughing their cure is certain and they have no more to fear At any rate I am a very inoffensive little fellow and pick up a goodish income for me and my wife whom as I hope to be saved sir I married because she has my faculty of laughing and will sit opposite to  me in her arm chair which God bless her she fills bursting full and titters at nothing by the hour together Oh she's a sensible woman sir and though she is so lusty I am fain to trundle her about the parlour for exercise she does make such fine remarks on medicine and on human nature and on the growth of the human hair that if I were a penman I would put her down for publication What a capital volume in  folio  would my wife be Even in  sheets  she cuts a very respectable figure I presume Mr Elixir said I  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha replyed the apothecary  Mr Elixir was now again set in for the above ha ha ha diversion  and tossed himself from chair to chair panting and fuming with his convulsion for near twenty minutes Oh various Nature how dost thou sport with us thy little creatures  After this Elixir spoke  We live I say sir comfortably but I am not absolutely in the richest part you know of the habitable globe and my customers who pay are in no proportion to those who do not pay The truth is I will cure a man at any time if he will but either laugh or cry with me and as I have taken notice those are the two matters most in practice in this world I think I stand a good chance to be supplied Yet I must tell you that though I choose always  to laugh in  company  I had always a thousand times rather cry  alone  Odds so odds so that's true said he recollecting himself I have a poor thing that I must see tonight and she lives full a mile from hence She must not be weeping in her bed while I am telling you a history that is not worth sixpence Besides she is poor  Upon this our master of physic sprung up and hurried out in the middle of as dark and rainy night as in  Summer  could possibly be  God be with thee poor fellow said I go where thou wilt May Providence keep every storm from thy heart  That he will papa replied Matilda you may depend upon it Here my daughter took out her pocketbook and pencil What are you writing Matilda said I Only the names of persons whom I recommend to you as proper sir for  The Green  Let me see my dear  Mr Edward Elixir and wifeTwo hundred pounds  per annum  Mr Henry Hewit and family Two hundred pounds  per annum  John Sawe to be protected  Agreed Matilda said I  Thus ended our evening  CHAP XIX MR SAMUEL SARCASM THE STEWARD SETS OUT ON A REMARKABLE JOURNEY  I WAITED now only for the approach of the next Spring which was advancing to people my new village The workmen were all paid off and discharged except John Sawe the worthy exception made by Henry Hewit and some few others who were retained as traders in the service of  The Green  But the most delicate and embarrassing part of the business yet remained this was to announce my intentions to the necessitous and unhappy in such a  manner  as might offer protection unaccompanied by insult Here was a  nice point I was effectually puzzled The steward advised that I should distribute a printed handbill in the way of  Walk in gentlemen walk in to  give wayThe Green  At another time he recommended me to place over the doors some large signs either of wood or metal with the following inscription for the use of travellers  Entertainment and an annuity for man and horse here GRATIS  But these sarcasms you may be sure I avoided They were amongst the waggeries woven into that honest man's constitution and so in consideration of his other good qualities I forgave him Matilda was of opinion that being for public utility the advertisement could not be too general and therefore  advised the mode of the  Newspapers  But this did not seem to me sufficiently  delicate  After much deliberation I resolved upon the following method out of many others which seemed to be less plausible viz That Samuel should be sent with circular letters from me to all my friends in capital situations to recommend such of their humble or unhappy acquaintance as might upon their experience deserve a protection in  ShenstoneGreen  and also that the like project should be seconded by Matilda in the letters which  she  should send over town and country at the same time  One fair morning therefore preparations having been made Mr  Samuel Sarcasm clapped the saddlebags across his favourite pad and was as well laden with letters as any mail whatsoever But he had not been absent three days before we received from him the following epistle  To Sir  B BEAUCHAMP SIR  LOOKING upon it that I am charged with such a commission as no steward had ever before in trust I am willing it should be so done as to hand down my name to posterity in a way to do it honour Being now as I take it on the road of immortality it behoveth me not to stumble It is to this end that I am baiting my horse at  a hedge alehouse in my way to London where most of your letters are directed The horse I say sir eateth while I write to know the  full extent of my commission  I forgot to ask certain particulars before I set out so pray tell me if I am to go to London  right on  or whether I may make such excursions as seem to promise me in the vagabond way any success Am I to take notice of any ragged tatterdemallions that I may meet overtake or follow upon the road such as beggars gypsies cor am I to let them alone I have already passed several very illlooking fellows and as many dirty husseys who I verily believe would not refuse to become our pensioners  There was particularly a man with a shock head of hair and two wooden legs who accosted me yesterday in God's name to give him a shilling By the splendour of his demand being eleven times more than ordinary beggars have the impudence to ask I am persuaded he would like to lay his stumps upon  The Green  If I had given him any encouragement he would certainly have undertaken to hop to you in about forty eight hours nay he worked away upon his timber ten or a dozen paces to show me how he could move but I have let him slip through my fingers If you think he is a prize sir I will contrive to pick him up and pack him in a cart or if your Honour  chooses in a coach as I come back Even in this pothouse where I am using the vilest pen and most polluted paper upon the most virtuous subject there are half a score as pretty that is to say as ugly objects for the pension as you could wish I do not believe there are twelve ounces of wholesome human flesh amongst the ten and to all appearance not above a shirt and an half were one to tack all their slips of linen together If these would not be glad of your Honour's patronage I do not know who would From what has been said then sir you will perceive that I could get a number of recruits and almost all such as are too frightful for any hospital  but your Honour's as I go along Fail not then to let me know the bounds of my authority and I remain in the mean time  Your Honour's Most faithful servant and steward SAMUEL SARCASM  In answer to this characteristic epistle I only desired Mr Samuel to do as he was directed and send me for the future more business than wit After this he proceeded in his journey Two months passed before I heard any further tidings but at the end of that period I received Mr Samuel's second epistle which you will find in the next chapter  CHAP XX THE STEWARD STOPS ON THE ROAD TO WRITE A LETTER TO THE PROPRIETOR  To Sir  BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP SIR  THINKING you have already been at some small expence in the building of  ShenstoneGreen  I have been sparing of making your Honour pay postage I forbore to write till writing was necessary It seems to be particularly so at present  I shall set out by observing that I have delivered all your letters to your GREAT friends most of whom  are so charmed with your Honour's scheme that instead of recommending  others  they would with very little persuasion accept of your offer  themselves  In short sir I have in the course of this original journey seen more of the world than I ever saw in all the former parts of my life Yet I knew men before Why London  is  a sort of  ShenstoneGreen  I mean sir the court quarterand the King of England is only another Sir Benjamin Beauchamp His Majesty like your Honour provideth his fine folks with a house and an annuity for  doing nothing  and they are so tired with the fatigue of that employment that I see plainly they would turn themselves  out of one place to catch at another were it only for the exercise of changing a posture I am in a desperate quandary how to act for as I said before two hundred pounds ayear and a good house is an object with almost every man and woman to whom your Honour and Miss Matilda sent letters On one score or another they find reasons to baffle all my endeavours to recommend by their means the unfortunate and intreat my interest on their  own accounts  Had I been a man who liked dirty money as well as clean money sir I could have made this tour turn out very decently for several brilliant bribes have been held up between mine honesty and my avarice It is two  months since from day to day I have been put off by these your  great  friends sir on the solemn promise of receiving a catalogue of proper objects when I next called but I am as far off as ever except that I have picked up a couple of gentlemen whom I think may do and whom I shall send down by the stage to  ShenstoneGreen  You have been sorely mistaken sir in your notion of the riches and situations of those you wrote to and I do not think you will be the better esteemed for having thus as it were thrown out a lure to get  at the bottom of their circumstances  It was a golden mistake while you were in ignorance sir but having once caught this secret and to say  the truth  trepanned  them out of it 'twill be a moot point whether you keep their good will or lose it Ah sir London connexions were not I doubt the proper ones to point out that kind of modest merit and obscure virtue which you want for  ShenstoneGreen  I found all but one man and of him I may speak hereafter in that sort of dazzling hurry which prevented either his seeing or hearing One of your friends sir at the time of my waiting upon him was bargaining for a trinket which the vender valued at fifty guineas and which the buyer designed as he said for a present to his mistress while at the other end of the room stood a poor fellow nipping his hat and  soliciting five guineas to pay his lodgings How doth your Honour think this matter ended Why the gentleman paid down the fifty guineas for the toy and told the petitioner that he was out of cash just then but might call next week or the week after Underneath sir are the several names of your  great London friends  who are willing to accept of your Honour's protection your house land and money to almost  any amount  They insist on my sending down the list before I proceed and as you will best judge yourself sir how far they are or are not objects I shall not intrude any remarks but beg your Honour's  reply as London is too  young  a place for the very old  SAMUEL SARCASM  N B The list is of my  own  making out for though most of the parties are near and intimate friends living in great splendour they all charged me to conceal their application from all eyes but those of Sir Benjamin Beauchamp so that you see how the gay imposition passes here sir and that most of your great friends are in the road to ruin because each man is ashamed to confess that he is jealous of his neighbour's finery and folly Thus sir though you receive the application of  many  every individual hugs himself on the secrecy  with which his business is carrying on by the medium of S S  A  LIST  of the  NOBILITY  and  GENTRY  who are the  GREAT FRIENDS  of Sir  BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP  and  CANDIDATES  for the  SHENSTONE PENSION  LORDS  Lord Lacewell  Hath thirteen livery servants six carriages and two blacks but would live with his beloved Beauchamp in a family way  N B This nobleman's house and furniture advertised in the papers for auction Feb I read it at breakfast  Lord Luckless  A very fine man with a very fine house Also two persons  out  of livery sitting in the hall  fronting the door  to see that nothing is removed off the premises without theirpermission  Lord George Gildcover  Hath the largest library of  wooden  books I ever saw Remarkable for having the best  imitations  of leather bindings in England  Lord S Scourgreen  Says he will sell his studd which I find as been empty these six weeks to live at  ShenstoneGreen  with his dear Benjamin  COMMONS  George Gravely Esq  Read your Honour's letter in bed where he  lies smarting under an agony of  the groin  curses town and wishes for a  retreat  in the country This is the gentleman your Honour thought so remarkably  prudent  N B Drank with his footman who told me in a whisper that his master owes his present illness to a jade who was turned away yesterday morning for  misdemeanours  Mr Benson  This merchant would very much like two hundred pounds ayear He tells me in confidence that there is no more good to be done in the Alley and that a snug birth in  Shenstone  FOLLY I give your Honour his own words  would be better than battling it upon Change at present  D Thurlby  R Brown  S Chapman  B Smith  J Beckford  R Oglevie  D Davenant  and  H Templar Esquires  Have all been so long on the town that they would like to kick up a dust in the country  I could not help feeling great surprize and indignation as I read this list for such is the face that  every one  of those persons put upon their circumstances and their conduct that they had for many years passed upon  me who was their old country correspondent as men of the first fortune and fashion On comparing the present catalogue with that given in by the  workmen  I could not but imagine that the bricklayer who fell from a ladder in the year the man who was much subject to corns and the boy who overset his barrow in the ditch because he was thicksighted had infinitely more fair pretention to the pensions of  ShenstoneGreen  than any of these honourable gentlemen of whose ways and means of existing and wasting I had been so very long ignorant I congratulated myself however that by this enquiry I had obtained a knowledge of real character and immediately gave orders that the steward should return into Wales  CHAP XXI SHENSTONEGREEN IS NOT PEOPLED WITHOUT A GOOD DEAL OF TROUBLE  BY this time it appeared perfectly plain that I must depend only on the care and diligence of a few other friends who on trial were not living in a state of gay deception and that where such care and diligence failed I must trust to the effects of a public advertisement I do assure you reader it is more troublesome to get a town reputably populated than to build it This was so sacred a truth in my case that the middle of the Summer shone off before I  could say  ShenstoneGreen  was properly inhabited Whether indeed it was  ever  properly inhabited may admit of a doubt However I shall not trouble the reader with any further delays on this point but cutting the disagreeable interval of barren application short which is an honest author's duty will carry him at once to the time when after many difficulties my houses were mostly occupied and my prospect of pleasure brought apparently to a crisis  You are now therefore to suppose that a sufficient number of persons well chosen and cautiously recommended are assembled upon the  Green  part of whom enjoy the irrevocable lifepension and part are  set up in trade for the general good All my views are nearly completed as far as regards external preparation The summer is before me Many families who were pining in want are in the bosom of indulgence THE GREEN is in full flower There are walks for pleasure bowers of ease and a church for devotion  Though this chapter is very short I shall end it directly on purpose to give you leisure to wish me joy of a great piece of work well terminated  CHAP XXII THE STEWARD SHEWS HIMSELF TO BE A MAN OF SENSE  IF you have not sufficiently revelled in the airy luxury which you doubtless suppose me to partake it would be almost a pity to disturb you with the truth Yet as it is the design of this narrative not only to divert but to  warn  I must descend from visionary pleasure to mere matter of fact  At this place therefore properly begins The Narrative of the good  People  of  ShenstoneGreen  A History of Human Nature or The New Paradise Lost  The satisfaction with which I saw so many happy human faces about me for happiness really resided with us almost a whole month is indescribable Many of the pensioners I had long known others were such as came sanctified by the warmest encomiums from such as I could thoroughly credit for luckily ALL my friends did not correspond with the characters in Mr Samuel's catalogue The trading part of our society settled apart from the circus in a comfortable way but with due regard to subordination The regulations of  The Green  were few and those extremely delicate All the parade of ringing the community to dinner or to prayers was inconsistent with my idea of  independence  I had established a commonwealth in which every man was to please and enjoy himself  in his own way  nor was there any other restriction except that the tradesmen were not to mix in the walks or amusements of the pensioners within the circus unless particularly invited For my own part I considered myself very impartially as the frank friend and familiar companion of every individual and lest any sort of jealousy should arise I endeavoured as much as might be to distribute my attention in equal proportions The greatest anxiety which I experienced arose from a certain fear of seeming in the eyes of some to be a man who enjoyed his preeminence To avoid which I cast off the dignity of the  person of fortune even more than usual and brought myself upon a level with the lowest  To such a community who would not give at least a twelvemonth's unanimity Had you seen reader the joy with which every pensioner spoke of his situation while the charm of novelty gilded it with how animated an eye every man surveyed his little portion of property and with how enraptured a step he walked along his own garden you would have imagined there was little reason to expect an alteration  I was  myself  so entrapped by appearances and so much in the heaven I had expected that meeting the steward one evening after I had been  walking like a common parent from door to door as was my custom well Samuel said I what do you think of my project  now  Confess man that your apprehensions were illfounded confess that  ShenstoneGreen  is the happiest spot in the whole world  Many men have many minds sir said Samuel it would be  atrocious  in me to break in upon a gentleman's pleasure though he is as it were trusting his hopes to sea in an eggshell Far be it from me to brew the tempest but as your Honour hath imposed on me this stewardship in which if I increase my profits I increase also my pains I think it my duty to speak my  mind and this I can do with the more assurance as I have obstinately refused any kind of familyadvantage from a scheme which I never did nor ever  shall  relish Not that I am without persons sir in my family to whom two hundred pounds ayear would not be a comfortable sinecure but I am an industrious man myself and do not like to cherish idleness in any of my race Add to which your Honour shall never have it to say that Samuel Sarcasm put it out of his power to speak his honest sentiment on this  atrocious occasion  by taking a sort of bribe Every one knows the effect of hush money I scorn it That being the case I wish your Honour would hear me  And what wouldst thou say Mr Samuel Cicero the conceited said I  I would say sir replied Samuel that your scheme is not better put together than was that of your renowned rival Don Quixote de la Mancha Why sir do you imagine any human society can long preserve its harmony without regulations Here have you brought together into one little spot of ground more than half an hundred people all or mostly all strangers to each other Do you forget that with that half an hundred of people you have crowded also into the same space at least half a thousand contrary  passions  You will say in reply that most of these pensioners are exalted from adversity to prosperity  I answer so much the worse the transition is too rapid That misfortune which is taken away  all at once  creates a levity that is ominous but if it is removed by  degrees  the head and heart may possibly bear it decently It is confessed some of these persons have been ruined by their ill stars others by their ill or at least their imprudent conduct I might even admit that not one of them is  vicious  but I must insist also that every  one  is an human being and consequently addicted to old habits and not brought without difficulty to the adoption of new nay I myself sir do not nor cannot feel myself at home in this same steward's lodge that you have built up for me It is to be sure larger finer gayer  grander but it has not as I may say the ease of the  old slipper  about it It wants a thousand little things that in fact may be of no figure but in the estimation of fancy who is the goddess of us all more or less they are of immeasurable magnitude Perhaps sir you will laugh when I tell you that in my new lodge I miss the three wooden pegson which I was for so many years accustomed to hang my hat my great coat and my canestring It is true there are a dozen fine showy brass hooks of which one might make the same use but if I tell you that in my notion they do not fit my  purpose  so well or rather that they do not fit my fancy you must blame human nature and not me who am only a poor imperfect  atom from the dust of the earth Be assured sir nothing in the world but my loving your Honour's quiet better than my own could make me spend the twilight of my day when all should go on still and softly amongst a set of idle creatures collected into one little circle where it is as impossible they should subsist in tranquillity as it is for yon steeple to stand without a foundation I beg your pardon dear and honoured sir I beg your pardon but you will find it as I say I know the species I know the species  Oh no my good fellow replyed I much softened by his conversation that may be the case with societies in general but  ShenstoneGreen  is so picked so guarded on the one hand with  by gratitude and on the other by convenience that depend on it you will find yourself agreeably mistaken  I wish it heartily answered the steward for to keep your generous temper in the same golden dream I could almost wish for once the order of nature inverted But I sir am an old fellow that have looked quietly into the heart of man for many years and I fear you have built up a village full of arguments against the possibility of your happiness Men carry their natures and wonted dispositions wheresoever they go But my duty calls me away as I see by yonder clock at the side of the church and therefore I humbly take my leave of your Honour  CHAP XXIII CONTAINING THREE GREAT SURPRIZES ONE FOR THE READER AND TWO FOR CERTAIN CHARACTERS  THERE is a particular kind of conversation which seizes upon all the faculties of the hearer and leaves him in an anxious state betwixt doubt and conviction Such was the emotion at this time wrought in my mind by the sentiments of the steward whom I never considered before as any thing beyond a shrewd sarcastic being but in this last discourse which by the bye he delivered in a tone unusually persuasive there appeared to be a sagacity and knowledge of men manners and nature  that struck me I confess I was even startled The possibility of having so long laboured in vain the bare possibility of a disappointment in a hope so tender and so indulged threw me into a very deep pain of thought It was the hour of night too in which meditation is heightened The moon shone and I indulged my resveree  Under such influence I rambled into the wood that lay at the back of the buildings and there I sat down upon a bench which was shaded by the thickest foliage of several beeches while it at the same time commanded two or three of the different paths  Presently along the most sequestered of these appeared the figure of a  female who sighed sorely and repeatedly as she passed She paced backwards and forwards for some time and at last stood fixed with her eyes uplifted to the moon whom she addressed in the following manner Oh divine and silver Queen of the Night If  he  still lives whom I adore may his bosom be calm and unruffled as thy ray at this moment May his heart never share the agonies which he has heaped upon Eliza If Cynthia thou art indeed the guardian of the Chaste exert thy utmost influence that he may not ultimately be lost to Eliza  I was just going to rise and advance when the rustle of the leaves  behind me and after that the surprize of a plaintive voice repeating these verses deterred me  In these deep solitudes and aweful cells  Where heavenly pensive Contemplation dwells  And ever musing Melancholy reigns  What means this tumult still in SIDNEY'S veins  When the voice ceased I perceived a man with his arms folded sliding as it were round a groupe of semicircular bushes which led him into the front path where I had a little before seen the lady Here in less than a minute the two met exactly in the instant that each was pronouncing the name of the other  My great Godexclaimed the lady  Oh righteous heavencried the gentleman  No sir said the lady disengageing herself on a sudden from the embraces of the stranger I am still Eliza I ask not by what means you found me in this asylumI am wronged  I sought it to soothe my sorrows in a new and unknown part of the world It is on this principle that I am Sir Benjamin's pensioner I arrived two days ago  And you will depart tomorrow It is impossible for both of us to taste the benevolence of the patron of this place My injuries are still in my heart  And is no part of Sidney there Eliza  Ought any part of Sidney to be thereanswered Eliza in the most penetrating tone  Ah madam it was my accursed delicacy and the pride of my youth it was not my heart that ever injured my Eliza I have been by the world and its follies reduced to the want even of bread since we last parted and had it not been for the benevolence of Sir Benjamin Beauchamp who takes me merely on the credit of some unknown friend I had been utterly lost  Too proud to own Eliza sir I sind even when you wanted bread  But I have served you Mr Sidney in despite of yourself  You  you  Eliza  I  was the unknown friend who took care that if you were living you should be an inhabitant of  ShenstoneGreen  Obligations madam heaped on the head without hope of repaymentI say Eliza there are minds minds of a certain frame which  Fresh injuries Mr Sidney  No madam the balance is even nay I know not but the scale may turn in  my  favour You was at a masquerade in some danger Recollect  My very life and honour was preserved by a generous domino  It  was  so Eliza and  I  triumphed in disguise  Save me from ruin yet refuse to speak or to discover yourself sir  For  that  very reason I cannot bear to be out done by Eliza  Nor I by Mr Sidney I will be revenged yetnay I  have  been so You are in my debt after all  Impossible madam  Remember your situation at Mr Joshua's  HaGo on  The scratch of the sword is still in  my  arm sir  Confusion madam you rescue my body to stab my souldmy sensibility is bleeding at every pore I had rather die than not be on an  equality  with Eliza Her superiority kills mebut one way is yet left  Name it  My joy at finding you here is so big and so unexpected that I shall certainly soar above even the ambitious flights of Eliza for I will bear to be  her inferior  and for the first time in my life yield up the delicacy of being on a  level  with the woman I adore  Then you  have  conqueredAh Sidney why so long in yielding What miseries might have been prevented  Blessed be Sir Benjamin Beauchamp ElizaWe are safe in his paradisehe is the guardian of our sanctuary My heart fluttered reader  He is more a God within the last hour than ever for I now know he is in possession of Mr  Sidney  Take care Eliza your very tendernesses must not  surpass mine  Your love madam is not superior  Is not a kiss usually the seal of a lover's forgiveness SidneyI suppose you know that our delicacy demands as usual inviolable secrecy No body is so much as to  suspect our passion  Love is hurt by being known to a third person  Have I ever madam been void of that sacred and essential delicacy  But a  hint  you know  Is an insult madamI am as nice as yourself  Not  more  so sir  No  perhaps  not more so  Perhaps    I tell you again Eliza I will bear tonight that you shall hold the  first place  in the dignity of passion Triumph triumph Eliza  On that score then we are friends  Friends  madamno we are not friends  Loversloversif you will Lord why don't you take my hand then and kiss it as you used to do  Here these overdelicate lovers who had thus met by accident went out of the wood in the greatest harmony after all those little spars which discover affection I left my bench and followed them so as not to be seen had they even looked back Curious to know the full extent of this uncommon delicacy of sentiment I pursued them even to the door of the lady's house at which they exchanged kind expressions and very modestly separated The gentleman tripped across the  Green  to his own apartments  The exultation I felt at the finishing of this transaction was by no means inconsiderable All the  sombre  ideas which the steward had spread about me were vanished No no Samuel said I there is no truth after all in thy seemingly solid sentiments If my adventures continue to go on as they have begun  ShenstoneGreen  shall boast its empire over the heart as well as the imagination A lover is already restored to his mistress and though both may be a little too punctilious said I both are amiable  I now walked home to bed kissed my darling Matilda as it was always my rule before I went to rest and then dreamed of Sidney and Eliza Happy rest to Thee reader  CHAP XXIV BEGINS WITH THE PROPRIETOR'S BENEVOLENCE AND ENDS WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF A WHISTLER  THE next morning's sun rose golden upon  ShenstoneGreen  and I went early forth into the adjacent fields to taste the loveliest hours of the four and twenty As I passed the circus than which nothing in Eden could well have been more beautiful I felt a kind of sensation which seemed to say these fair environs are Benjamin of thy own creation it was thou who caused the rosetree to be thus saluted by the dashing dewdrop Yon lillies pinks and eglantine which send  their odours on the zephyr were of thy planting And ah more voluptuous and more dear to thought thou it was who adorned these little repositories with the happy souls which now inhabit them and caused every dwelling to be surrounded with sweets The very sun seems to dart on thee as thou thus standeth in the centre of thy works his rising ray of approbation Every pensioner is now in the balmy arms of sleep Lovers who were before divided are dreaming of tomorrow's interview The latelyseparated husband and wife are brought again by thy means into the bed of reconciliation The invalids of the place are reposing themselves Those who had fallen from the heights of fortune into the vales  of distress have here a cradle in which they are lulled into peace In a word thy whole family is at this moment in elysium  Ah SHENSTONE wert thou but here to complete the felicity which was by thee suggested how perfect would it be This fond idea led to a consideration of that amiable man's moral character and I could not help exclaiming in the words of a poet who at once imitated and lamented him  They call'd him the pride of the plain  In sooth he was gentle and kind  He mark'd in his elegant strain  The graces that glow'd in his mind  On purpose he planted the trees  That birds in the covert might dwell  He cultur'd the thyme for the bees  But never would rifle the cell  Ye lambkins that play'd at his feet  Go bleat and your master bemoan  His music was artless and sweet  His manners as mild as your own  I had by this time got into the fields where I perceived walking with large full strides over the ridges of the land a man who seemed to be crossing the country on some business of the utmost dispatch He was tall and well made but in that sort of dress in which appeared the marks of a gentleman reduced He had an handkerchief in his hand with which from time to time he wiped his forehead His shoes had all the look of having laboured through a long journey and the dust of the road had deeply embrowned his oncewhite stockings Yet notwithstanding all  these marks of a vagabond there shone through his shabbiness a certain air of fashion and dignity which denoted him to have known better days Upon seeing me walking along the green side of the hedge he still quickened his pace till he came up to me whistling all the way extremely loud  We exchanged bows  Sir said the stranger in a noble and full pronunciation can you direct me the nearest way to the mansion of Sir Benjamin Beauchamp  Have you any particular commands with that gentleman  No commands sir but many entreaties I come with recommendations to him from particular friends  Who may those friends be sir  They are as I understand the only ones who could procure a man the honour of Sir Benjamin's protection  Have the goodness to name them  Poverty and a feeling heart  Powerful advocates it must be confessed sir  Yes they are so and it is under such splendid patronage that I have the confidence to offer myself as a candidate for  ShenstoneGreen  There sir is a voucher for my truth  Here he took from his pocket a letter and again requested I would direct him on his way  I believe sir said I looking at the superscription you may suffer me to break the seal of that letter  Whew cried the stranger how could I be so long mistaken Where is fled all at once my knowledge in the history of human faces How has it been possible for me to overlook lineaments so palpable That open brow and that expanded eye to whom could they belong but to Sir Benjamin Beauchamp There sir read your letter  LETTER  To Sir  BENJAMIN BEAUCHAMP  DEAR OLD FRIEND  YOU still ask me to collect candidates for  ShenstoneGreen  which you have built on a very new plan  indeed This scrawl will be put into your hand by a person whom I have known as many years as I have known your In all that time his immense riches appeared his least attraction We have monuments of him in several parts of this city which will carry his character with that of Sir Benjamin Beauchamp to posterity To my utter astonishment he now complains of a sudden turn which makes him seek a sanctuary with your  Shenstonians  I have myself offered him money to any amount He rejects all examination into his affairs and says the only favour I can possibly do him is to say a decent thing for his distress to my old friend Sir Benjamin  With regard to  decent things  as he calls them were I to say all which I know of Mr Seabrooke the bearer I must write a volume and not a letter  I am dear Sir Benjamin Your old friend And humble servant P PECKHAM  London  Mr Seabrooke said I as soon as I had finished this letter the only matters which distress me on this occasion are first the inconsiderable size of the  Shenstone  premium when it is compared to the property which you have been accustomed to command and secondly that you should have been under the necessity of coming  to your little pittance on foot Had I known sir  WhewSir Benjamin said Mr Seabrooke interposing do not you be afflicted at the very things which form a material part of my happiness There is great variety in a man of my temper in thus stepping from an unweildy fortune to such a one as I can very well manage It cuts off superfluous anxiety It is like entering a neat cottage where one detects an impropriety in a moment after coming suddenly out of great apartments whose length and vastitude prevent the possibility of being  accurate  With respect to  walking  it is the favourite exercise of my life I sometimes divert myself  with objects on the road which my being  on a level  with them offers to observation and yet which had I been perked up beyond my natural height on the back of a horse would have been all overlooked In a gay maylady or in gilded bug in the twist of a branch or in the colours of a flower I see a satisfaction which though I very sensibly feel when I am in the proper humour I shall not attempt to describe If therefore you have the goodness to give me my own way you will bestow one of the smallest houses of your new town and slit the yearly pension between two  In the course of this conversation I had turned about towards  The  Green  and we were on the way home to the mansionhouse  And this I presume is your  New Paradise  said the gentleman as we came within view of  ShenstoneGreen  Here you amuse yourself in a way wherein you will find few to applaud and  none  to imitate you For my part the chief satisfaction I shall find under your protection is to live in this fair world and join the chorus of happy creatures in their oraisons and vespers of gratitude Whew what a divine Sir Benjamin you are  I led Mr Seabrooke from hence to the mansionhouse where he I and Matilda sat comfortably down to breakfast  Young lady said he to my daughter you see a very proud beggar before you I am come to seduce your worthy father by a whining tale out of two hundred ayear and a good house As you are his only daughter and consequently his heir pray how do you relish this scheme  My father replied Matilda is in full possession of my sentiments on that head and will therefore more gracefully inform you of them than it is in my power Yet I cannot but add that as I am convinced Sir Benjamin is ever delicate in selecting his objects I feel additional satisfaction at seeing two hundred pounds ayear  more  likely to be laid out to the best advantageShe curtesyed  Oh brave damsel rejoined Mr Seabrooke but do you rightly consider how many much finer things might be done with that sum of money Miss Matildabut your very name is an encouragement to poetical projects  No really sir pray instruct me how that is possible said Matilda putting the sugar into Mr Seabrooke's cup  Why two hundred pounds  per annum  answered Mr Seabrooke would enable you supposing it to be reserved wholly for fashionable luxuries to do a great many genteel and imprudent things of which you have now perhaps no conception If it were laid out to advantage you  might therewith do a great deal of mischief It would even go a considerable way at the cardtable and give you the headach or the heartach for a week together For ought I know you might contrive to ruin your complexion clear as it is for ever with the sum which you are here going to expend upon a poor fellow with a pair of rusty shoes and a coat of camblet Really young lady it is a serious affair and I would have you think well of it beforehandI would indeed  And now you talk of that Sir Benjamin continued Mr Seabrooke after a short pause I cannot but think  you  are engaged here in a very singular piece of business Why  my good sir do you maturely reflect into what innumerable channels this ocean of money you have exhausted on brick mortar and men who are no way allied to youdo you I say consider how such riches might have as it were deluged every dishonest sense about you in that pleasure which is so much the general pursuit Instead of you ample range of houses which rob Sorrow of her destined prey and the real scoundrels of the earth of their ridicule might you not have built up stabling for the finest steeds that ever were seen and might you not have had the satisfaction of inviting the world to see your fine horses instead of your poor men and women Instead of erecting a  Church  could you not at  less expence have built a  Seraglio  and peopled it with destitute beauty and defrauded innocence in the manner of many persons of fortune Instead of giving away such loads of wealth might you not have put in for the chance of doubling it at the hazard table and even if you should perceive the die go against you is it not a sort of exit made popular by the practice of modern men of spirit to retire from the gamingtable in elegant disorder and very philosophically shoot yourself through the head Instead of providing for the subsistence of such a pack of poor wretches as in the wise opinion of the world have no  right  to the appetites or passions of nature could you not with the solid  cash or as the miser calls it more emphatically with  the good hard money  so expended have made a river of claret and swam in all the voluptuousness of the most expensive drunkenness In fine might you not have been the most gainful usurer or any other celebrated character much coveted amongst men had you acted in a prudential way Instead of which you have nothing to show for forty or fifty thousand pounds but a large handsome village which does not bring you in one shilling of "good hard money" a few tears and smiles from poor souls who have nothing else to give you a private pleasure which pleases your conscience without filling your purse and the expectation of a something  yonder here he pointed to heaven which is of so little weight in the estimation of other people that they would not lend a single guinea upon such security No Sir Benjamin you may go on as you please but if you cannot answer this conduct to yourself I do not know who you will find amongst your friends that will step forth in your behalf They will be afraid sir to say any thing in excuse lest the same singularity should be expected on their part  The fine ironical tone which attended this speech led us immediately into the oblique compliment it conveyed and Mr Seabrooke had herein so developed his own character  that all further description of him is unnecessary I take it for granted the reader hath a very favourable idea of him and would wish a more intimate acquaintance It is most likely he will not be disappointed  Suffice it to say at present that after a great deal of persuasion both from Matilda and me he agreed to live in the mansionhouse in a familyway but still insisted that I should save nothing for though I might stop something for  board  he said he was resolved to have the rest of his pension like another pensioner  As look and manner is not very accurately put into written language I cannot well tell you how this last  observation occasioned a sincere smile I just remark that Mr Seabrooke is a man with whom it is impossible to be offended  END OF VOL I
