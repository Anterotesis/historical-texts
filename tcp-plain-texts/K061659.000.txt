 AN APOLOGY For the LIFE of  Mr  T C  Comedian  BEING A Proper Sequel TO THE APOLOGY For the LIFE of  Mr  Colley Cibber  Comedian  WITH An Historical View of the STAGE to the Present YEAR Supposed to be written by HIMSELF In the  Stile  and  Manner  of the POET LAUREAT  Of all the Assurances I was ever guilty of this of writing my own Life is the most hardy impudent is what I should have said Through every Page there runs a Vein of Vanity and Impertinence which no  French Ensign's Memoirs  ever came up to My Stile unequal pert and frothy low and pompous cram'd with Epithets strew'd with Scraps of secondhand  Latin  aiming at Wit without hitting the Mark My Subject below all Pens but my own which whenever I keep to is flatly dawb'd by one eternal  Egotism  COLLEY CIBBER's Life p  Sequiturque Patrem non possibus Aequis  LONDON  Printed for J MECHELL at the  King'sArms  in  FleetStreet  Price Two Shillings  TO A  Certain Gentleman  SIR  _BECAUSE I know You do not love to see your Name in Print imagining it is us'd in some impertinent Satire though I was now writing the daintiest  Dedication  of any modern Author yet I would chuse to conceal it  Let me talk then just as it comes into my Head about You and to You this Way let me tell You of what I will or how I will You are under no Necessity of taking it to Yourself Nor when I boast of your Excellenc'es and Transactions need You blush that I have perform'd them in such a Manner as to claim the complimental Homage of my Pen Or I may now give You all the Attributes that raise a cunning intriguing Man to the highest Offices and Employments and no  be censur'd as one of your  hireling Advocates  either by my own or your EnemiesI place my own first not because they are the greater Number but as in the  Cer  monialia  of Heraldrv the most insignificant Personages begin the Pomp to introduce those of more elevated Consequence I mention'd my Enemies first to introduce the Mention of yours  Yours and such you have for they are not so wellbred as not to declare themselves have carried on long though successless Attacks against You And  Sir  give me Leave to compare my little Self to your great Honour as there is no Hazard or visible Terror in an Attack upon my defenceless Station my Censurers like Yours have been Persons of an intrepid Sincerity But I shut the Door against them all while I am thus privately talking to You and have little to apprehend from either of them  Under this Shelter then I may safely tell You that the greatest Reason I have had to publish this Wo  l  has arisen from the several Performances which I publish'd last Summer and which you had Goodness enough to patronize How far indeed your good Nature to a  young Politician  or your Reluctance to put the Vanity of one of your  new Authors  out of Countenance may have carried you I cannot be sure And yet Appearances give me stronger Hopes For was not the Complaisance of a whole Summer's Sufferance to imploy my Talents in your Service as much as an Author of more Importance ought to have expectedWhy then was he desir'd by Mr  Pxtn  to write second  Gazeteers  Or why was I kept in the Service to tell more of the same  Stories  If these Employments have made me vain shall I say  Sir  you are accountable for themNo  Sir  I will rather say that my own Forwardness and  dashing through thick and thin recommended me to the Notice of your SupervisorGeneral for  Gazeteering  and  Pamphleteering  Or rather so far flatter myself as to suppose it possible that You having been a Patron and Lover of Master  Walsingham  and Dame  Osborn  and one of those good Judges who know the Use and Value of such Writers under a right Regulation might incline You to think my Labours and Lucubrations of more Consequence than they may naturally be to others of different Sense who may have less Concern or Taste for them But be all this as it may As for this  Apology  for my Life I have written it not only to shew my own Parts and illustrate my own Story but I have decorated it with several Remarks Political as well as Theatrical and explain'd the Meaning of some of my Writings which were dedicated to your Service Now  Sir  as my apologetical Brat is born rather than see it starve on bare ParishProvision I chuse clandestinely to drop it at your Door that it may exercise one of your many Virtues your Charity in supporting a very dull Dog of an Author  Now  Sir  were the World to know into what Right Honourable Hands I have thrown the following History their Regard to its Patron might incline them to treat it as one of his own  Family  They might say such Things of it as may be improper for me to mentionFor this Reason I conceal your Name as that  must necessari  y lead me to descant on a Subject which might be ungrateful to your Ears for I am at characterising Friend or Foe a very Devil at my PenIn consciousness therefore of what I  am  I chuse not to say what You  are  I leave that for other Historians and for Posterity to relateHowever as your Equals in Rank have done publick Justice to your Character the Concealment of your Name may be an unnecessary Diffidence But am I Sir of Consequence enough in any Guise to do Honour to Sir Were I to set You Sir in the most true Lights that your Actions deserve or your own Likeness requires yet my officious Mite would be lost in that general Character and Regard which People of the first Consequence even some of all Parties even some of your  own Dependants  have a Pleasure of speaking of in Private Encomiums to Persons in your high Station are liable to the Suspicion of  Flattery  and can add little Lustre to what before was visible to the Publick You are cloy'd without Doubt by such Offerings You have them almost daily offer'd up to You in publick and in private at your  L  v  e  at the  Ty  at the  DrawingRoom  and  Lobby  of the  SenateHouse  besides the zealous Ejaculations which are offer'd for your Service in an inimitable Paper which is distributed throughout the Kingdom  gratis  But these Offerings like  Pagaa  Incense evaporate on the Altar and rather gratify the  Priest  than the  Deity  But You Sir are approach'd frequently and oft in Terms of  Common Sense  The honest Oblation of Hearts which have just Sense enough to mix Reason with Accusation How really true or whether the Zeal of such Devotees of  Common Sense  are false I shall not here examine But Sir was I admitted with all my laughing Spirits about me to be my idle Self and to write what I could write on that Subject I should surely be distinguish'd by You from a Parcel of  dull Set of Rogues  whom your good Nature and Charity induce You to believe are  Wits  This Nakedness of Temper the World may place in what Rank of Vanity they please but till Wisdom shall point out a Way to make me more heartily happy than your Favours I am content to be gaz'd at as your Creature as I am without lessening my Respect for You and laugh at those whose Intellects may be more soberly cover'd  Yet Sir I will not deceive You it is not the Lustre of the Power You possess the immenseness of your Fortune your Figure in Life and the  just Rewards  for your Services which you had rather deserve than be told of that have made my plain honest Heart hang after You these are but incidental Ornaments that may be of Service to You but my particular Esteem has risen from a mere natural and more engaging CharmThe agreeable  Rewards  which You confer on your  Creatures  Nor is my  Vanity  so much gratify'd in the  Honour  as my  Convenience  in the  Delight  of such pecuniary  Felicities To see You lay aside your Superiority and conser with a  mean Author  give him  Instructions  and  Gold  Vid C Cibber  's Dedication  'tis then I ta  e You then Life runs high I desire I possess You  Yet Sir it must be a farther Share of Pleasure to look on You with the publick Eye and view your  Intregrity  This Sir is a Theme  Si mihi sint centum Linguae sint ora{que} centum  Had I an hundred Tongues this Theme to raise  Had I an hundred Mouthsto mouth thy Praise  Those Tongues these Mouths that Praise cou'd never tell  How You can  All  and e'en  Yourself  excell  None but YOURSELF can be your Parallel  When I consider You in this View and in the Height of Power I could rejoice mightily for You and Myself to see  You  in this particular Light of Glory and  Myself  admitted to reflect the Beams of it throughout  Great Britain  If this  Apology  for my  Life  discourages You not to prevent my Design I have some Thought of writing an  Apology  for  Yours  I think myself equal to the Subject and should be proud if You would by this Exercitation of my Genius suffer me to approve myself  SIR  Your most obedient most oblig'd and most humble Servant T C  July    AN APOLOGY For the LIFE of Mr  TC  c  CHAP I  The IntroductionReason for writing an ApologyThe Author's Birth and FamilyApromising GeniusSent to  Winchester School  An Occurrence thereA Digression on Vanity and AmbitionOf Systems of Philosophy  c  _AMONG all the Foibles incident to human Nature none take a stronger Possession of the Soul of Man than  Ambition  There are indeed sundry Ways and Arts to gratify this lofty Passion which though it may divide itself into different Channels yet from the same Source various Streams take their RiseMy Readers may be surprised at my setting out with so philosophical an Apothegm but it is a very proper Introduction to the following  Apology  as it was from an innate Thirst of Ambition that I undertook to publish these  Memoirs  of my  own Life  Some witty smart Gentlemen may call it  Vanity  With all my Heart and to deal ingenuously with them I frankly confess it was that Species of Ambition which by hereditary Happiness descends to me call'd VanityA Vanity for what cries a more grave Annotator To shew there are two Coxcombs in a FamilyMust there be two Apologies for the Lives of two Fellows no one car'd a Halfpenny forWhy perhaps merely to signalize myself or perhaps to imitate the laudable Steps of my worthy Parent or perhaps to defend my Conduct from some publick Reproaches I have thought proper to make an Aplogy for my Life and surely among the Majority of the World this Attempt will stand uncensur'd as they will be ready enough to allow the Life of no Man stood more in Need of an Apology than mine And to shew my Readers what a candid impartial Person I am I will in this Disquisition of myself bring my own Heart to the Bar and try it without Favour or Affection I shall consequently betray much Folly and talk much of myself but I have very great Examples to authorize such a Liberty Old  Mich Montaign  it seems in his Essays tattled more about his own queer Body and Mind his Cat and an old Woman than all the World beside so much had he set his Heart upon  himself  The ingenious and modest Mr  Colley Cibber  has outdone  Montaign  and not only talk'd a great deal of  himself  but has set so great a Value on  himself  that after being so long known he will not let any one know what he really is under a less Consideration than a  Guinea  Since this was wrote the Apology is sold for  s  But in these Memoirs of my humble  Self  I shall at a cheaper Rate take the Liberty to illustrate my Way of Thinking Writing and Acting both as to my theatrical and private Life by the Apology which he has made for his own nor can I think the Publick will be displeas'd to see what Kind of a Parallel will be drawn between a  Father  and  Son  who have on many Occasions so remarkably distinguished themselves  Nam vitiis nemo sine nascitur optimus ille  Qui minimis urgetur  I shall therefore conclude this Introduction to my Story in his Words  "Upon an honest Examination of my Heart I am afraid the same Vanity which makes even homely People employ Painters to preserve a flattering Record of their Persons has seduced me to print off this  Chiaro Oscuro  of my Mind"  But as he hopes immediately after that no one will expect a Man of his  hasty Head  should confine himself to any  regular Method  I am in equal Hope that no Method or Connexion or Regularity will be expected from mine I shall also make  Digressions  in my Memoirs when I think they begin to grow too  heavy  for the Readers  Digestion  Vide C Cibber  's Life p  for  Digressions  it seems are in this Kind of Writing what Eggs are in a Pudding they  lighten  the Composition and render it more palatable and digestive This is my Apology and the best Apology I can make for becoming my own  Biographer  I come to that customa  y and important Point in all Histories of  Great Men  their  Birth Parentage  and  Education  So great a Curiosity is there in Mankind to be informed of these Particulars that almost every revolving Moon produces illustrious Memoirs of  Heroes  and  Heroines  whom dire Destiny has allotted to a fatal End As these Records are to preserve their Memories from more than  Lethaean  Oblivion every minute Circumstance of their entering into the first  Scenes  of Life are related the Name of the Parents their  Trade  and  Calling  and whether they sent them to  School  and had them instructed in  Reading  and  Writing  are told with great Fidelity These Things on mature Deliberation may seem very trifling and of no Signification to the World whether they were known or notVery trueBut yet there is such an Avidity in human Nature for  trifling  that these  Tyburnian  Memoirs are read by the  Great Vulgar and the Small  with no little Delectation Was there no other Excuse than this Humour of Mankind I know not how I could let my  Birth  be pass'd over in Silence but the Excuse my Father had made before me must stand for mine which is what my Brother  Bayes  makes Prince  Prettyman  say in the  Rehearsal  viz I only do it for fear I should be thought Nobody's Son at all  Though I cannot think I use this  Theatrical Wit  with a Force equal to that which he quoted it for the publick having long known my Father they have unanimously paid him a Compliment which all Fathers have not paid them  vizThat I am my Father's own Son  But whose  Son's Son  I was guess from the following Extract from the  Apologist  I imitateHis Paragraph of  Lineage  runs thus  I was born in  London  on the th of  November  in  Southampton Street  facing  Southampton House  My Father  Caius Gabriel Cibber  was a Native of  Holstein  who came into  England  sometime before the Restoration of King  Charles  the Second to follow his Profession which was that of a Statuary  c  The  Basso Relievo  in the Pedestal of the great Column in the City and the two Figures of the Lunaticks the  Raving  and the  Melancholy  over the Gates of  Bethlehem Hospital  are no ill Monaments of his Fame as an Artist My Mother was the Daughter of  William Colley  Esq  of a very ancient Family of  Glaiston  in  Rutlandshire  where she was born My Mother's Brother  Edward Colley  Esq  who gave my Christian Name being the last Heirmale of it the Family is now extinct I shall only add that in  Wright  's History of  Rutlandshire  publish'd the  Colleys  are recorded as  Sheriffs  and  Members  of  Parliament  from the Reign of  Henry  VII to the latter End of  Charles  I in whose Cause chiefly Sir  Anthony Colley  my Mother's Grandfather sunk his Estate from three thousand to about three Hundred Pounds  per Annum  Although I am very far from laying any Stress on the Pomp of Heraldry and a long Scroll of  Family Descents  for well I know my Pedigree though traced as I doubt not but it might be to  William  the  Conqueror  will confer no intrinsic Value on me for conscious I am that any Regard to my Being must be beam'd only by the Rays of Virtue yet in  simple Truth  I must confess that I think I owe something to having  good Blood in my Veins  For a  Latin  Poet justly says  "Qui viret in foliis venit a Radicilus humor  "Et Patrum in natos abeunt cum femine mores  Which I thus venture to translate  The Leaves their Verdure from the Roots receive  And Souls their Children have the Parents give  Every one who has read  Horace  knows  Fortes creantur Fortibus  c  Still from the Valiant are the Valiant sprung  I need make no Application but if  Valiant  why not  Witty  These Scraps of  Latin  may seem very unnecessary for  some  they might still seem more unnecessary had not I translated them for  others  However I cannot think them in the least  Bagatelle  They introduce very properly the next Thing I was to mention which was my  Education  Nay when I have given such a Proof of it as to quote  Latin  and translate it I think no farther need be given But however as in my  Apology  I would be like another  Apologist  Longo sed  PROXIMUS  Intervallo  I shall follow his Manner  About the Year or I was sent by my Father to  Winchester School  in order to be elected into  Winchester College  for it seems by my Father's Mother's Side I was descended from  William  of  Wickham  the FounderIn what Branch I am ingenuous enough to say I know not yet from my Soul I contemn that vile Insinuation which a  certain Counsellor  at a  certain Trial  made that it was by some  collateral  Branch as  William  of  Wickham  was a  Churchman  at a Time when  Matrimony  was not allow'd ofThe Inference is evidentBut I will be bold to say that glittering glaring glistering  Witwou'd Flash  is as  unjust  as  unmannerly  It equally affects all those educated in  Winchester College  as well as hewho was intended to be educated there as Descendants from the  Founder  But to returnIn this School I receiv'd the first and last Rudiments of Learning as my Father did his at  Grantham  in  Lincolnshire  but if he has more Learning than me it is to be observed  he went from the lowest Form to the highest and I did not proceed above half the Way Yet this Analogy appears between usHe says  C Cibber  's Life  p    "Even there I remember I was the same inconsistent Creature I have been ever since always in full Spirits in some small Capacity to do Right but in a more frequent Alacrity to do Wrong"  Just such a Creature was have been and amam IHe gives us as the first remarkable Error of his Life  Vid p    jesting and jeering and joking on a Schoolfellow I have also been thrash'd unpity'd for the same Thing but such Circumstances even tho' my  Father  's Pen was to relate them may be thought damn'd ridiculous Be it enough that I was always eager of Fame and Glory and making an  Ecclarisement  about the Town I lov'd to make an Appearance and remember in some extraordinary Adventure the taking another Boy's  lac'd Hat  to wear occasioned me much  posterior Anxiety  But  Vive Hodie  was my MottoSome immediate Satisfaction of my Passions which were always varying sometimes to  Dress  sometimes to  Eating  or  Drinking c  was my Desire from an  Infant  and I am afraid some charitable Folk may say I retain too much of the same Temper now I am a  Man  I very well remember when I was a Child I took an ambitious Liking to a  scarlet Cloak  with  Gold Trimmings  and wept most resolutely for the same which was the only Means I could think of for coming at my Ends but my Mother counterplotted me and brib'd away my Pride with a crooked Sixpence And indeed in those Days I would have drop'd my most towering Aims for a Lump of  gilded Gingerbread  or a  Custard  Sometimes a  GoosberryTart  would cure a furious Fit of  Ambition  Once I remember when I had thrown myself on the Ground with a Resolution to  die  because my Father would not give me a  Horse  to ride and manage as I thought proper being then full five Years old but my Mother cur'd this  Ambition  by  shewing me a Pair of  new white Gloves  and a Handful of  Cherries  I cannot pass by without throwing out some farther Reflections on these  boyish Tricks  "  C Cibber  's Life  p    whether flat or spirited new or common false or true right or wrong they will be still my own and consequently like me I therefore go on to shew as well the Weakness as the Strength of my Understanding"  By a  Digression  therefore to make this Tittle Tattle sit  light  on a Reader's  Digestion  I draw a Moral from itAmbition or Vanity when uppermost is bad for either Man or Child and as it makes Children naughty it makes Men Children  I have often thought my childish Ambition for a  scarlet Cloak  of the same Stamp as we often meet with in higher Life It is the same Principle which swells the Hearts of the Great as puff'd up mine and if a due Regard to Nature be observed it will be allow'd so For Instance If a Man of the first Quality as the Duke ofI had almost nam'd his TitleBut I say suppose a Man of the first Quality who had liv'd to about his thirtieth Year despising to be distinguish'd by any publick Gewgaw opposing a Minister from a Supposition of his being an evil one should all of a sudden run bowing to that Minister's  Levee  desert his Party break with his Relations and turn as great a Slave as any he despis'dWould not any one think there must be some great Power of Reason to cause so surprising a Change But what if it should be Ambition Would they not think something very  august  was the Object of his Soul But if after all it was only a  Red Coat  would not his Caprice of Ambition prove as ridiculous as mine for a  Red Cloak  I could illustrate my other childish Appetites by more Examples were I not afraid the Partiality might give Offence to my CourtFriends for however like my Passions and some great Mens may in fact be it is not my Interest nor Duty to make the Comparisons  Ex 'Pede Herculom  However I may observe that the Variety of my Desires  in my Childhood for there was a Time when I was a Child  are such as are to be observ'd daily among Mankind I have known a young Gentleman of Fortune set out with all the  heyday Expences  of the Mode yet when he found himself  overweigh'd with Appetites he grew restless kick'd up in the Middle of the Course and turn'd his Back upon his Frolicks  I have also known a very witty young Fellow become a very grave Man and yet  when he was in Company and was call'd to it could still make himself the  FIDDLE  of it  If I were capable of Envy this last Gentleman's Character would incline me to it for to be wise and at the same Time merry is a State of Happiness in Perfection  "  C C  bber's  Life  p    When I speak of Happiness I go no higher than that which is contain'd in the World we now tread upon and when I speak of being merry I don't simply mean what every Oaf is capable of but that Kind of Mirth which not is more limited than recommended by that indulgent Philosophy  "Cum Ratione insanire"  These Sentiments of my Philosophy I have express'd in the Words of that gre  t Author whom I imitate and of whose Sect I confess myself a Disciple And I will here observe to the Reader that through the whole Course of these  rhapsodical Memoirs  I shall quote from that incomparable  Apologist  whatever may equally allude to  myself  not only as my mean Stile cannot reach his  Daintiness  of Expression but as this Method will the better shew what an  Analogy  there is between usThe Readers who are candid will say  Ju  ta positi magis lucescunt  But as to my Philosophy for this is making a Digression in a DigressionI remember a merry laughing wit  y compl  isant Fellow who was always the most obsequious humble Servant of some Man of Fortune or other compar'd himself once to a Philosopher and the  under of a new Sect It was honest  Gnatho  in one of  Terence  's Plays who said all the Followers of his System should be call'd  Gnathonici  I know not but from my Father's Apology some new Philosophers may arise and Posterity not give a proper Title to their Sect therefore I here mention that all who are of our Opinion may distinguish themselves by the Name of CIBBERIANITo be a reasonable  Madman  is what I always would be tho' I have too often been said  insanire sine Ratione  Some may say that I had better not be  mad  at allBut as my Father charmingly says  Is this a Time of Day for me to leave off my  Fooleries  and set up for a new Character Can it be worth my while to waste my Spirits to bake my Blood with serious Contemplations and perhaps impair my Health in the fruitless Study of advancing myself into the better Opinion of those veryvery few wise Men who may think different from me No the Part I have acted in real Life shall be all of a Piece  Servetur ad imum  Qualis ab incepto processerit  I can no more put off my Follies than my Skin I have try'd but they stick too close to me and when I have seen others whose Rank and Fortune have laid a sort of Restraint upon their LibertyI have softly said to myselfWell there is some Advantage in having neither Rank nor FortuneGive me the Joy I always took in the End of an old Song  My Mind my Mind is a Kingdom to me  Let the World call me any Fool but an unchearful one I live as I write while my Way amuses  ME  it is as well as I wish itThe Man whose becalm'd Passions know no Motion seems to be in the quiet State of a green Tree he vegetates 'tis true but shall we say he lives  O expressive Description This is the  ratione insanire  in the very Stile incomprehensibly sublimeO dainty Simile A Tree when it is green and vegetates and flourishes cannot be said in our Philosophy to liveReader take heed for I have a strong Impulse to talk impertinently and shew myself in all my  LightsHere I could draw an imaginary Monarch and dress him in all the Mockery of Greatness with all the cumbersome Robes of Majesty with all the Devastation of Ambition in his Thoughts till my Imagination was heated and fatigu'd in dressing up a Phantome of Felicityand what thenWhy prove he was not half so happy a Fellow as myself  Let them be Converts to the  Cibberian  Sect who will our Founder does not impose these Laws but follows them  himself  and is followed by  myself  If we are misguided it is Nature's Fault We follow her and reason goodNature has distinguish'd us from the BruteCreation by our  Risibility  Homo animal Risibile est  Her Design was by our  Os Sublime  our erected Faces to Lift up the Dignity of our Form  God gave to Man an upright Face that he  Might view the Stars  Corner of an Almanack▪  From this System we may justly stile ourselves  natural  Philosophers  But nevertheless without divine Assistance be we never so wise or foolish we cannot reach this merry Felicity So that all my  Parade  and  Grimace  of Philosophy has been only making a Merit of following my  own Inclination  A very natural  Vanity  But this  Vanity  does not impose on me  Vanity  againHowever think it Reader  Vanity  or not  Vanity  or  this  or  that  or  t'other  that has drawn me into this  copious  Digression it is now high Time to drop itAfter playing the Philosopher in this Manner I shall now return to  School  againA Place where some of my  Witwou'd  Enemies may say would be very proper for me but as I have forestall'd their Jest none but the dullest Rogues will pretend to make it  CHAP II  He that writes of himself not easily tir'd Boys may give Men LessonsWrongly satiriz'dOn SatireWrote generally for BreadHis Thoughts and Behaviour when satiriz'd  c  _AS my Pen is running over the Paper to form this Sentence I am smiling  Sir Reader  to think what an odly contented Coxcomb I am to set myself down to write this  Apology  for my  Life  But you know nothing gives a Coxcomb so much Pleasure as to talk of himself which sweet Liberty I am now enjoyingThis Pleasure none but Authors as vain as myself can conceiveBut to my Story  However little worth Notice the Actions of a  Schoolboy  may seem yet as they act on the same Motives as Men their Consequences are worth observing because it is some Kind of Satisfaction to hehold in what Degree the Dawn of a Genius first appear'd For this Reason Mr  Colley Cibber  Vide  Apology  p    tells you that at School  he made an Oration on King  Charles  the  II  's Death when all the Boys in his Form out of Modesty thought such a Performance above his Capacity and was laugh'd at and jeer'd and ha  ed as  a pragmatical Bastard For this Reason he acquaints you that with the least Restraint to  Modesty  he did what would have frighten'd a Boy of a meek Spirit from attemptingHe made an  English Ode  on King  James  's Coronation and made it in half an Hour  "The very Word  Ode  then adds he makes  you smile and so it does me not only because it still makes so many poor Devils turn Wits upon it but from a more agreeable Motive from a Reflection that for half a Century afterwards I should be call'd upon twice a Year by my Post to make the same Kind of Oblations"  Here the Reader sees in the  Puris Naturalibus  that Dawn of Genius which  bashful Modesty  could never restrain from writing and who still makes such  Odes  which all the poor  Devils  of  Wits  cannot put him out of Conceit of But to  myself  I cannot say that among my SchoolFellows I made my great Figure or raised their Envy by any learned Compositions yet I know not how it was I had then an innate Kind of Propensity to Scribbling and without any partial Flattery to myself I can affirm I chose or rather accidentally struck into one Species of Writing in which I was not only then without an Equal but have remained so ever since  Here perhaps I may again seem vain But if the Facts are true how can I help it If I have a tolerable Feature will not that as much belong to my Picture as my Imperfection In a Word the Story is this  While I was at  Winchester  there came some  PrizeFighters  from the  BearGarden  at  London  and as I was always fond of  Heroes  and martial Deeds I introduced myself into the Company of these KnightErrants of the Blade It happen'd that however brave the Heroes were they were not very learned In truth they could neither write nor read It was on this Occasion that they desir'd me being a better Scholard Prizefighters Language to pen their  Challenges  which they instructed me to indite Here I gave the first Demonstration of my Parts for having been us'd at  London  to read Playhouse Bills and hear Tragedies my Father being Master of a Playhouse I wrote their Bills of  Challenge  with such Art and express'd the Heroes Thoughts in such magnanimous Phraze that they alarm'd the Soul of the Reader and rouz'd up a greater Desire for a Gladiatorial Spectacle than all the Drums in  Christondom  These Challenges of my inditing had wonderful Success the People were amaz'd at the swelling Pompousness of the Heroes Language and  consequently imagined that those who were terribly courageous with their  Pen  must be very  Lions  at the  Sword  But alas it is one Thing  Scribere  and another  Agere  Their Valour did not near equal the Nobleness of my Description for the Battle they fought was a sham one However they returned their grateful Acknowledgments to me and I was Author of all their Challenges which with much Art I diversify'd during their whole Stay  Well says some grave Annotator who has not heard some private Anecdotes of my Life what do you infer from this Tale Hear another and take the Inference of them both together Some Space of Time had elaps'd since my Heroes of the Blade left  Winchester  when a Company of Hireling Actors arriv'd I soon made myself known to them and was accordingly admitted to their Rehearsals One Morning I casually took up a Paper which was a written Bill of the Performance they were to exhibit in the Evening I immediately found there was something deficient or at least something that might be alter'd to raise the Expectation of the Populace and bring a better Audience to the House I communicated my Thoughts very freely to the Master of the Company and shew'd such an  uncommon Genius  for writing and composing a  Playhouse Bill  that with a complaisant Bow he intreated me to write theirs I comply'd with his Request and wrote them in such a  promissory Way  a Way which has been since call'd  Puffing  that they engross'd the Attention of the Town and by an attractive Quality brought them several good Audiences I cannot pass by one Thing the Master of the Company and his  Roxana  were of an ambitious Spirit to indulge which I ordered their Names to be printed  six Times  as large as any of the Rest of the Performers An Article of  StageVanity  which I have since most frequently practis'd with much Glee of Heart and PompMagnificent  Now to apply these Stories from such small Beginnings my Genius soar'd to an unequal Height and I have had for this Species of writing no one hardy enough to become my Competitor in Fame With a pleasant Recordation of Mind I think what Praises were  bestowed on the Advertisements and the Bills of the  BearGarden  while I had for some Years the  Honour  of  writing  them They were attributed to my Pen and the most partial Witling that ever pretended to be arch upon me would allow that in this I was inimitable I shall not mention what Degree of Excellence I have arriv'd to in  Theatrical Bills  and  Advertisements  and  Puffs  and  Paragraphs  My  Modesty  will not suffer me to give to  Posterity  in these Memoirs what the present Age says of them Be it enough that there is that  Something  in them which no one can hit but  myself  From what I have mention'd I would observe this that wherever there is Merit there is a heavy Tax laid on it Envy and Malice will demand a considerable Share of the Praise which is due to you However great my Success has been in the Species of Writing I have describ'd above yet it has rais'd me many Enemies Persons who cannot bear to see any shining Parts in another without endeavouring by a Cloud of intervening Darkness to eclipse them The little Genius that I have and which hereditarily descends to me from a paternal Source of Wit has often occasion'd me in the very Springtime of my Life to become the But of witless Censure and Invective and the same Reason makes me frequently the Object of Raillery in publick Coffeehouses and publick News Papers But as the greater Poll of Mankind would rather vote for Censure than Commendation Satire has a thousand Readers where Panegyrick has one therefore when I see my Name or Characteristick for my Name in a Journal or Pamphlet I look on it as an Artifice of the Author to get a Dinner He considers that my Face and Name are more known than many thousands of more Consequence in the Kingdom that therefore right or wrong a Lick at poor THE' or the  Young Captain  or  Ancient Pistol  or by what other Name soever they please to dignify and distinguish me will be a sure Bait  ad captandum Vulgus  to catch little Readers and gratify the Unlearn'd In almost these very Words the  Laureat Apologist  makes his Complaint on being satiriz'd with his Name at length by Mr  Pope  And I must add that  as Mr  Pope  for let him be as great a Satyrist as he will I am not afraid to speak out for the Sake of the Pence satyriz'd the inculpable Mr  C Cibber  It was for that Reason and that Reason only that Mr  Cibber  's Son must be mention'd in his Rhymes What else could provoke him to say  Shall  Cibber's Son  without Rebuke  Outswear a Lord  Pope  's Imitation of  Horace  Well they may say what they will of the  Cibbers  but it must be a Proof they have something very singularly exquisite in their Ways and Manners when their very Names carry a Joke in themBut this Detraction of these Retailers of Wit is most admirably compar'd to  Colley Cibber  's Life p  Dung  "thrown upon a Meadow though it may at first seem to deform the Prospect in a little Time it will disappear of it self and leave an involuntary Crop of Praise behind it"  To cope with such Antagonists would be ridiculous for as the same Author wittily says  "Would my bearing ill Language from a Chimneysweeper do me less Harm than it would be to box him though I was sure to beat him"  As no Wit or Criticism can make me worse than I am no serious Reply I can offer will make me better I have indeed sometimes been induc'd to give publick Answers and publick Appeals but I think in my own Judgment and by experimental Knowledge that such a Proceeding is wrong It is more eligible to be severely strict to the Principle laid down by Mr  Cibber sen  which is to join in the Laugh against  myself  and honestly say of myself all may be said against me What he says on writing an Apology for his Life  Vide  Motto  is the Motto to mine nor can I add any Thought of my own to so just and impartial a DescriptionIt may be said that this being before Hand with the Wits is all Affectation in me and my giving myself Airs of shewing myself my Father's own Son is too true to make a Jest ofHe  quotes a Line on such an Occasion  C Cibber  's Life p  Cinna  or  Cibber Vide  Pauper vult est Pauper  "When humble  Cinna  cries  I'm poor and low  "Y  u may believe himHe is really so  I shall give the  Latin  Line a different Turn  The  Cibbers  both themselves dull Rogues declare  But what they say in  Jest  in  Truth  they are  Yet after all what can all the Squirts and Popguns of Jest and Raillery avail against the sevenfold Shield of  Confidence  and  Contempt  My Soul is like an ample Shield  Can take in All and Verge enough for more  Who can make me more ridiculous than Nature has made me If then Sir  Critick  you attack this Apology to expose me take Care you don't expose yourself if you write to snew your Parts and Genius and all that why you are as errant a Fool and Coxcomb as me  Ditto    "But perhaps you may want Bread If that be the Case even go to Dinner in God's Name whatever you intend me as a Disfavour will fly back into your own Face as it happens to Children who squirt at their Playfellows against the Wind"  When a Person of any Spirits and Genius once gets into a Differtation on himself he is a good while before he can get to the End of the Chapter the pleasant Subject steals imperceptibly upon him nor ever thinks he while he is not weary of writing any one else may be weary of reading I was saying to shew a Contempt for low Wit and to laugh at it yourself was the readiest Way to take the off the LaughNow Reader if you are not tir'd I'll tell you a  Story  If you arelay aside the Book and come again when you have a better Appetite  In that Year when the Stage fell into great Commotions and the  Drury Lane  Company asserting the glorious Cause of  Liberty  and  Property  made a Stand against the Oppressions in the Patentees In that memorable Year when the Theatric Dominions  fell in labour  of a  Revolution  under the Conduct of  myself  that Revolt gave occasion to several Pieces of Wit and satirical  Flirts  at the Conductor of the Enterprize I was attack'd as my Father had been before me in the publick Papers and Journals and the burlesque Character of  Pistol  was attributed to me as a real one Out came a Print of  Jack Laquerres  representing in most vile designing this Expedition of ours under the name of the  Stage Mutiny  in which gentle Reader  your humble Servant  in the  Pistol  Character was the principal Figure This I laugh'd at knowing it only a proper Embellishment for one of these necessary Structures to which Persons only out of Necessity repairBut now comes the grand Attack a Summer Company was at this Juncture performing at  CoventGarden Theatre  and our Transactions and my Character were thought worthy to be represented on the Stage Accordingly a young Spark who was just come from  Trinity College  at  Cambridge  to set up for an Author in Town and who had just before wrote a Farce call'd the  MockLawyer  thought this a proper Time to exercise his  Genius  To work he went and  Pistol  was to be his Heroe A Farce was wrote and perform'd and the Bent of it was to ridicule poor  me  Tone of Elocution my buskin Tread my Elevation of Countenance my Dignity of Gesture and expressive Rotation of Eyeballs In short all my Manner was burlesqu'd and a mock Pomp of Words which were a Parody of Tragedy Speeches and  Pistol  's Bombast run through the CharacterThis I will say the  Thing  was so well tim'd and the Person who mimick'd me did it so well that it succeeded far beyond any the least intrinsick Merit that was in itBut where am I again digressingHow d'ye think I behav'd on this Occasion I knew if there was any Thing smart upon me the Audience would very readily laugh at it and indeed at a Rehearsal I thought some Things smart enoughWhat then did I but plac'd myself in one of the Sideboxes in the full Front of the House and was resolv'd like  Cibber  's self  'Sblood to stand them all  Epilogue to  Nonjuror  Well the Scene open'd and on  Pistol  's appearing there was a thundering Clap and all the Eyes in the House converted on  me  every Sentence that hit at  me  the Joke was heighten'd by looking at me who laugh'd as much at  them  and the  Poverty  of the  Author  's Wit as the Author or the Audience could possibly do at me but seem'd only to join the Chorus and laugh for mere good Humour Towards the last Scene the Author had introduc'd a Sale of theatric Goods and one of the Properties put up to be dispos'd ofwas APOLLO  's crack'd Harp and wither'd Crown of Bayes  Upon which a Character on the Stage reply'd  Oh Pray lay that aside for Mr  Pistol  he will claim that by  hereditary RightThis immediately put the whole House in a  Roar  and  Encore Encore  was all the CryHere the whole Pit stood up and look'd at meI join'd the laughing  Encore  and in the Repetition of the low Witticism clap'd heartilyThis joining with the Humour of the Multitude could give them no Pleasure and what signifies being a little severe on one's Self to prevent other People's being soThis was my Way of Thinking  Insuevit Pater optimus hoc me  This Art profound this happy Thought  My good my modest Father taught  I am always proud to show in what Steps I trod Read the next quoted Paragraph  "  C Cibber  's Apology p  In the Year there were many Authors whose Merit wanted nothing but Interest to recommend them to the vacant laurel and who took it ill to see it conferr'd on a Comedian insomuch that they were resolv'd at least to shew Specimens of their superior Pretensions and accordingly enliven'd the publick Papers with ingenious Epigrams and satirical Flirts at the unworthy Successor These Papers my Friends put into my Hands with a wicked Smile and desired me to read them fairly in Company This was a Challenge  I never declin'd and to do my doubty Antagonists Justice I always read them with as much impartial Spirit as if I had writ them myself While I was thus beset on all Sides out steps a poetical KnightErrant to my Assistance who was hardy enough to publish some compassionate Stanza's in my Favour These you may be sure the Raillery of my Friends could say I had written to  myself  To deny it I knew would have confirm'd their Suspicion I therefore told them since it gave them such Joy to believe them my own I would do my best to make the whole Town think so tooAs the Odness of this Reply was I knew what would not be easily comprehended I desir'd them to have a Day's Patience and I would print an Explanation to it To conclude in two Days after I sent this Letter with some doggerel Rhimes at the Bottom"  To the Author of the  WhitehallEveningPost  SIR  THE Verses to the  Laureat  in yours of  Saturday  last have occasion'd the following Reply which I hope you'll give a Place in your next to shew we can be quick as well as smart upon a proper Occasion And as I think it the lowest Mark of a  Scoundrel  to make bold with any Man's Character in Print without subscribing the true Name of the Author I therefore desire if the  Laureat  is concern'd enough to ask the Question that you will tell him my Name and where I live till then I beg Leave to be known by no other Name than that of  Your Servant FRANCIS FAIRPLAY  Monday January    These were the Verses  I  Ah Hah Sir  Coll  Is that thy Way  Thy own

stand them all  IX  Thunder 'tis said the Laurel spares  Nought but thy Brows could blast it  And yetOh curst provoking Stars  Thy Comfort is thou  hast  it  These doggrel Verses I have quoted with the same Design as the  Laureat  publish'd them in his  Apology  to shew you his particular Cast of Temper and consequently from what Fountain I have deriv'd mine I cannot lose this Opportunity of mentioning another  Analogy  between us As in our Tempers there is a peculiar Similitude so there is in our Faculties in Writing  C Cilber  's Life p  He has too bold a Disregard for that Correctness which others set so just a Value on and when he speaks any Thing that delights him he finds it difficult to keep his Words within the Bounds of common Sense  Even when  he writes the same Failing gets the better of him  and Instances that wellknown Expression of his That Mrs  Oldfield outdid  her usual  Outdoings  Now have not I in all my Writings shewn a thorough Disregard for pedant Correctness In all my Speeches on the Stage have not I in the fullness of my Heart broke through all Bounds of  Common Sense  Yet I must confess though I have given many flat Writers Occasion to be brisk upon my general Stile I was never so floridly happy as to make one single Expression a Standard Jest for ten Years together I never hit on a Verb with so pleasant an Accusative after it as could have such an Effect  Vide  p    for wherever the Verb  OUT DO  could be brought in the pleasant Accusative  OUT DOING  was sure to follow it  and  Deries repitita placeret  says the Apologist It has been said of this very Sentence that the pleasant  Accusative Outdoing  is Nonsense as it is not Grammar But pray let me ask such Pedants Is there not a  Licentia  of a  Quidlibet  Audendi  which all great  Genius's  claim Let cold ph  matic Writers like dull Packhorses keep to the be  en Path Men of Fire and Spirit like Nags that have Blood in their Veins will bounce out of the Road start into full Speed and show their MettleAgainIs it not a Characteristick of Excellence to have a Stile so peculiarly singular that in the reading half a Page you are sure of the Author Has not the great  B  ntley  gone on in this Principle in all his most erudite CastigationsCa  hing the Stile of the Authors has he not said of  Horace  and  Ter  nceSic scripsi    Thus he wroteHas he not said  Aut sic scripsisse debuit  Or so he should have wroteHas he not boldly asserted  Sic lege meo periculo  Read thus at my PerilThe same Method he has taken with  Milton  The amount of all this is if a singular Stile is a Demonstration of a Genius I will venture without any Infringement on Modesty to affirm that the  Cibberian  Stile is a Proof of very remarkable Talents and I know not but some future Critick will quote that to hit on a  pleasant Verb  followed by a  pleasant Accus  tive  is a Mark of Excellence Nor am I without Hopes but that there are some rhetorical Boldnesses in my Compontions which may be admir'd by late Posterity  Now the Reader may think this is all said with SeriosityNo Mr  Cibber sen  confesses that to  outdo  an  Outdoing  is a  vile Jingle  nor can I deny that there may be some few Expressions in my Writings which may perhaps raise a SmileBut what then it is our Happiness though we write such Things seriously we can laugh at them jocoselywhen others begin to laugh and if other good Writers cannot do the same they want that good Sense which some other People may be endow'd withIf you write well your  C Cibber  's Life p  Work  wi  go  without Crutches  or would I  Vide Ditto  publickly  put every  A  gument to Death  that appears against me This were to be an Executioner instead of a Gentleman Praise is a  v  luntary Tax  paid by the Publick they  may chuse whether they will pay it or not but in the End  Merit  will  compel  them to it  To conclude the Substance of all that I have said might as well been said at first in two Lines of a great Author and which in a great Character I have often spoke with Applause  Two Lines in the Character of  Pistol  in  Henry  the th  Si fortuna me tormento  Sperato me contento  CHAP III  The Author's several Chances for the Church the Court and the ArmyDesign'd for the UniversityTook to the StagePolitical Thoughts with many others which can be only known by the Reader's Perusal  c c c  _AFTER the long Digression which I made in the last Chapter and the  Truant  which I have so long play'd from School I am at a Loss for an  Apology  to address the Reader I left myself at  Winchester  School not making the greatest  Eclat  in Classical Grammatical and such Learning yet distinguishing  myself  by some puerile Excellencies My Father to be sure had some great  Designations  of me of being a  Bishop  or perhaps an  Archbishop  he intending me for the  Church  as he himself had been intendedBut to neither of us  Sic Dii Voluere  To introduce my Story in this third Chapter I must quote the Introduction to his  "  Vide C Cibber  's Life p  I am now come to that Crisis of my Life when Fortune seem'd to be at a Loss what she should do with me H  she favour'd my Father's first Designation of me he  ight then perhaps have had as sanguine Hopes of my being a Bishop as I afterwards conceiv'd of being a General Nay I had a third Chance of becoming an Underpropper of the State How I came to be none of these the Sequel will inform you"  My Father as I before himed had conceiv'd great Designations of me but there was a Concatenation of Things which occasion'd me to follow the same Tract which he had trod in before I was not elected into  Winchester  College All the Reasons may not be altogether so proper to repeat I unfortunately mistook the Sense of a Line in  Virgil  NISUS  amore pio pueri  c  However to this Day I cannot think the making a false  Comment  on a Passage in a  Heathen  Author should be a Disqualification for Ecclesiastic PrefermentBe that however as it will it was I think about the Year when a Change of Ministry was happening at  London  and the Right Honourable Sir  RW  was about to make that illustrious Figure in  Europe  which we have since seen while the Nation was in  Labour  of such a  Production  my Affairs also were in Labour of some Event when I happen'd to be sent up to  London  to my Father to be turn'd loose into the Bustle of the WorldAt this Juncture you cannot but observe that the Fate of Sir  R W  and  T C  were at the same Time upon the Anvil In what shape they would afterwards appear was only Guesswork What Characters we have since attain'd all  Europe  knows in Regard to  Him  all  Britain  in Regard to  Me  But a still more remarkable Crisis happen'd to Mr  Colley Cibber  on his Return from being a Candidate for  Winchester College  Take his own Story  "The Nation now fell in Labour of the Revolution The  Prince  of  Orange  was landed in the  West  my Father  was in Arms under the  Duke of Devonshire  but I jump'd into his Saddle and he return'd to  Chatsworth  where he was at Work At this Crisis King  James  and the Prince of  Orange  and that of so minute a Being as myself were at once upon the Anvil In what Shape they would severally come out though a good  Guess  might be made was not then  demonstrable  to the deepest ForesightBut adds he if one Month sooner I had been at the University who knows but by this Time that purer Fountain might have wash'd my Imperfections into a Capacity of writing instead of Plays and Annual Odes Sermons and pastoral Letters"  And  who knows  if I had attach'd myself to the Order of Priesthood what a Figure I might by this Time have made I might instead of writing  Country Correspondents  and  Daily Gazetteers  have penn'd  Characters  of Queens and spoke Speeches from a Reverend Bench in Defence of Prime Ministers  You must now consider me at a Period of Time which produced such a Change in publick Affairs which as I can now judge of them were of great Consequence to the Nation When I think of this  Aera  being famous for a Change that made Sir  R Prime Minister  I naturally digress on Prime Ministers and the Changes they are wish'd to meet with  C Cibber  's Lise p  "While great Men want great Posts the Nation will never want seeming Patriots and no Ministers but will be heartily rail'd at But I cannot forbear thinking that they who have been longest rail'd at must from that Circumstance show in some Sort the Proof of a Capacity"  If this Circumstance of being long rail'd at is an undubitable Characteristick of a wise and able Minister the  Right Honourable Gentleman  whose Crisis of Fortune was depending at the same Time as mine has been the most able and wise Minister that ever manag'd the Affairs of this Nation Notwithstanding this Proof of Capacity  he  and his  Measures  have been talk'd of much in the same Manner as Mr  C Cibber  politically remarks  People did of King  James  and his Conduct  "  C Cibber  's Life p  It is incredible says that Historian with what Freedom and Contempt the common People in the open Streets talk'd of his  wild Measures  yet we of the Vulgar had no farther Notion of any Remedy for this Evil than a satisfy'd Presumption that our Numbers were too great to be master'd by his mere Will and Pleasure that though he might be too hard for our Laws yet he could never get the better of our Nature and to drive all  England  into Slavery he would find would  be teaching an old Lion to dance"  There are I say Men malecontent and weak enough to talk in this Manner of Sir  R  and to use the above  el  g  nt  and apt Simile who think themselves too  old Lions to be taught to dance  But I don't see how they can help it for to compare this  great Man  to what he has never yet been compar'd he is like another ORPHEUS who can make these  old Lions  move to the  Tun  he  plays  and they must  dance  while he using another of the  Laureat  's Expressions is the  Fiddle  of the  Nation  These are a few of my political Notions by which you may see what a Sort of a PartyMan I am but if talking of the Minister has drawn me at any Time ever so far out of my Depth I still flatter myself I have kept a  simple honest Head above Water  And it is a solid Comfort how insignificant soever I may seem that I have made One among many others who have wrote Papers and Pamphlets to prove the happy Effects of this present AdministrationThus may I be said to have become in Reality an  Underpropper  of the  State  which my Father not getting a Place in the  Vide C Cibber  's Life  Secretary's Office  never arriv'd at  But to recover the Clue of my History I was now come from  Winchester  to  London  to turn out into the  Bus  le of the World  in which according to my Rank of Life I have made more Bustle than any one before me My Father did not know well what to do with me for I had so remarkable a Genius that I was fit for any Thing and yet fit for nothing In this Vacancy of his  Resolution being a forward Youth I wanted to know something of the World which Knowledge I soon attain'd and began to run into the  heyday  Gallantries of a Man of Mode In short I thought myself a very  pretty Fellow  The  clear Emannations  of  Beauty  struck me into a Regard for the fair Sex that had something softer than profound Respect I could not resist its Power which is efficacious on all for  Beauty like the Sun shines into equal Warmth the Peasant and the Courtier  So good a Taste my first hopeful Entrance into Manhood set out with  Vide  Apology p  My Father had the same Kind of Heart which was ready to be  shone into Warmth  and he handsomly  The samé Page  apologizes that as he was waiting at Table on the present  Dutchess Dowager  of  Marlborough  in the Year of the Revolution these two Words  Litto  for this Relation and these Phrases  Some Wine and Water  These  two  Words only that very  single Sound struck upon  his Senses which were collected into his Eyes by the  clear Emanation  of her  Beauty  This gay Spirit of mine gave some Uneasiness to my good Mother but my Father laugh'd at it as a pleasing Recordation of himself To hear of some of my youthful Sallies which were the Effects of great Spirits and into which none but your great  Genii  run to see an honest Boldness or modest Assurance in Countenance and Speech which none but Men conscious of Merit have This must give him a pleasing Recordation of Mind then he might truely cry out with Extasy  Motto to  Cibber  's Life  "Hoc est  "Vivere bis vita pisse priore frui  Which he since translates thus  "When Years no more of active Life retain  "Tis Youth renew' a to laugh 'em o'er again  But which I translate for I can translate as well as he thus  'Tis to live twice to see the Life you led  Again liv'd over by the  SON  you bred  Or thus  'Twas to live twiceTwice the same Acts enjoy  To see the same still practis'd by his Boy  After this Interval of Idleness some Views of Life were set before my Eyes as the Army or the City The Army I lik'd tolerably nay so well that I partly took upon myself and was partly complimented by my Companions with the News of  Captain  And it is with some Pleasure I hear myself call'd the  young Captain  to this Day But a small Commission however more honourable it might seem I began to know was not so profitable as the Profession of an Actor And though my Father at the Revolution had Thoughts of being a GeneralOfficer Things were now chang'd and I have often bless'd my Stars for my preferring the Theatre to the Camp on that I have been a Heroe strutted with a golden  Trun  h  on  nodded Command to  Roman  Legions and old  British  Bands In the Army I might have still trail'd a Lieutenant's Halfpike and in some Country Quarters liv'd inglorious for Years pacific roll'd revolving round the Spiritstirring Drum the Earpiercing Fife all Pride Pomp Circumstance of glorious War have long'd been lo  t in Peace which long Farewel have told the Soldier's Occupation lost'Twas  n the S  age alone I promis'd myself much Pleasure much Income and much ReputationNor is a  heatric Profession so contemptible as some affect to think  "Was a little foolish Prejudice laid aside  C Cibber  's Life p  Mr  C Cibb  r  truely says that many a wellborn younger Brothe  and many a Beauty of low Fortune would gladly have adorn'd the Theatre who by their not being able to brook such Dishonour to their Birth have pass'd away Lives decently unheeded and forgotten"  In short it is better to be this or that on the Stage so you get handsomly by it than live in any Degree of Ignominy  or not Ignominy off from it that is there is no Ignominy on the Stage or if you will the Stage is above Ignominy  See this Period  "I rememember says Mr  Cibber  C Cibber  's Life p  a Lady with a real Title whose female Indiscretions had occasion'd her Family to abandon her being willing to make an honest Penny of what Beauty she had left desir'd to be admitted an Actress Her Relations oppos'd it for Reasons easy to be guess'd at It was not our Interest to make an honourable Family our Enemies and she was refus'd Here you find her honest Endeavour to get Bread from the Stage  i e  to make an honest Penny of her Beauty was look'd on as an additional Scandal to her former Dishonour so that I am afraid had the Lady sold Patches and Pomatum in a BandBox from Door to Door she might have starv'd with less  Infamy  than reliev'd her Necessity by being famous on the Stage"  In short 'tis no Ignominy to be  la Damoiselle de Plasir  in a Theatre  But notwithstanding all I have said and my Father before me the Profession of a Player still continues as by his Memoirs I find it has always done to be held by many Gentlemen and People of Quality in no great Esteem and many outrageous Insults have been committed by Persons who would be thought Gentlemen on Actors whom they dar'd not have used so in any other Place but a Theatre But these Insulters of  Audiences  as well as  Players  are not to be rul'd there is no contending with them they are all Patriots Liberty and Property Men who roar out to defend their  Magna Charta  of doing what they will in a Theatre This Usage of Players Mr  Cibber  says  "keeps young People of Sense from coming on the Stage they fear entering into a Society whose Institution if not abused is an excellent School of Morality But alas as  Shakspear  says  "Where's that Place where into sometimes  "Foul Things intrude not  And really the Abuse of the Stage by the Actors be it as great as it will by acting indiscreetly in their private Lives it is not greater than the Abuse that those noisy Rioters make of it by their publick Disturbances I cannot apprehend what rational Authority this  Society for the Reformation of theatrical Manners  can plead to call an Actor to an Account on the Stage for what he has done off it Would any Judge pay less Regard for a Counsellor's Argument at the Bar because he may be an indiscreet or even a bad Man at homeBut it is otherwise at our theatric Bar of Judgment our  Judges  are also  Jury  and likewise  Executioners  and though you appear there not as your own Person they make you the  Culprit  put you immediately on your  Trial  and  Gd send you a good Deliverance  But I may say what I will against thse unjust unlimited Insults yet the Player who falls under such a Caprice of publick Displeasure must be left  adrift and ride out the Storm as well as he is able  I would here speak of some Storms which poor I have been adrift in and which I have outrode by that admirable Stage Apothegm  'Sblood I'll stand you all  But that Anecdote will fall under my Pen in a subsequent Chapter To conclude this the View of rising some Time or other to live in that modish Affluence jovial Gaiety and seeming Importance in which my Father and some others I saw liv'd was the flattering Light by which I steer'd my Course Such Temptations were too strong for so warm a Vanity as mine to resist on the Stage I came being entered according to my Merit at a very low Salary and now gentle and most candid Reader your Curiosity is from thence to expect a farther Account of me  CHAP IV  The Author follows Mr  Colley Cibber  's Method of HistoryA short History of the Stage and Actors from the  Restoration  to the  Revolution  Their CharactersWhy given  c  _AS I have profess'd myself an humble Imitator of Mr  C Cibber  's peculiar Manner of  historical Narrations  I hope the Reader will not think frequent  Digressions  from my own Actions and Life any Way inconsistent for though I have only promis'd an Account of the material Occurrences of the Theatre during my  own Time  yet a short History of the Theatre from the  Restoration  to the  Revolution  and from thence to the present Year may be worth more Notice than giving the Publick an Account of my youthful Adventures for which little  Apology  I am afraid can be made As in an Account of this Nature I cannot make use of my own Knowledge and Judgment I must claim the Privilege of all  Historians  of having Recourse to those Authors who have treated on the Subject before Nor shall I omit that Part which modern History is much founded on  Oral Tradition  To these I shall add such Intelligence as I could collate from such  ancient Records  as still remain in the  Archives  of the  Theatre  But though I may severally use all these Aids the chief Support which I shall rely on will be the  Memoirs  which Mr  C Cibber  has with great  Authenticity  and  Judgment  collected and I shall also give a faithful Abstract of his  Theatrical Characters  because they will lead you into a clearer View of some modern ones which I myself at a due Time and Place shall venture to  pourtrayBefore I enter on this Undertaking I must premise that many are the inimitable Beauties in Stile in Thought and Manner of the great  apologeti  al Original  which my Compendium will not allow me to introduce however the Reader may depend my Abstract from it shall be so connected that I will give him the  Quinta pars sui Nectaris  The very Quintessence of his  NECTAR  And this Chapter shall be as it were  Ilias in Nuce  The  Iliad  in a  Nutshell  Without farther Preface or Apology  The Civil War which was begun between King  Charles  the First in Defence of his Prerogative and his People in Defence of their Freedom introduced at Length all the Effects of Anarchy Every Thing that was truly good and virtuous was no longer in Esteem Those pions Schools of Morality the  Playh  uses  were no longer suffer'd the Stage fell with Monarchy and the Peers of the Land with the Actors of the Theatre But as it fell with Monarchy it was with Monarchy restor'd for at King  Charles  the d's Restoration two Patents were granted one to Sir  William D'avenant  and the other to  Henry Killegrew  Esq  according to Mr  Cibber  's Account or to Mr  Thomas Killegrew  according to the Relation of that  Theatric Annalist John Downes  the old  Prompter  The Company under Sir  William D'avenant  says Mr  Cibber  were call'd the  King's Servants  and acted at the  Theatre Royal in DruryLane  the other the  Duke's Company  who acted at the  Duke's Theatre  in  Dorset Garden  But Mr  Downes  wrote an Account of the Stage during his own Time call'd  Ros  ius Anglicanus  Downes  says  "that on the Restoration the scattered Remnant of  six Playhouses  which subsisted in King  Charles  the  First's  Time upon the Restoration fram'd a Company and acted again at the  Bull Playhouse  built them a new Theatre in  Gibbon's TennisCourt  in  ClareMarket  in which two Places they continued  acting all and Part of In this Time they built them a  new Theatre  in  DruryLane  Mr  Thomas Killegrew  gaining a Patent from the  King  in order to create them the  King's Servants  and from that Time they call'd themselves his  Majesty's Company of Comedians  in  DruryLane  As to the Company acting under Sir  William D'avenant Downes  gives this particular Account of its first Rise and going to  DorsetGarden  "In the Year  one thousand six hundred and fiftynine  General  Monk  marching then his Army out of  Scotland  to  London  Mr  Rhodes  a Bookseller being  Wardrobe Keeper  formerly as I am inform'd to King  Charles  the  First  's Company of Comedians in  BlackFryars  geting a License from the then governing State fitted up a House for acting call'd the  Cookpit  in  DruryLane  and in a short Time compleated his Company  In this Interim Sir  William D'avenant  gain'd a Patent from the King and opened a House in  LincolnsInnFields  with new Scenes and Decorations being the first that were ever introduced into  England  where they continued to act till the Year when they open'd a new Theatre in  DorsetGarden  and remov'd from  LincolnsInnFields  thither"  The Reader cannot but observe some Difference in these two great Historians to shew my faithful Attachment to Truth I have given both Accounts and gentle Reader  Utrum▪ Horum Mavis Accipe  Of the King's Company about ten were put on the Royal Houshold Establishment having each ten Yards of scarlet Cloth with a proper Quantity of Lace allow'd them for Liveries and in the Warrants from the Lord Chamberlain they were stil'd  Gentlemen of the Great Chamber  Both these Companies were in high Estimation the long Interdiction of Plays had given fresh Appe  te to such Representations besides before now no Actresses had been seen on the Stage The Characters of Women  in Theatres were perform'd by Boys or young Men of the most effeminate Aspect And what Grace or MasterStro  es of Action can we conceive such ungain H  ydens to have been capable of These two Theatres had another advantageous Rule made by themselves which was that no Play acted at one House should ever be attempted at the other This prevented a Sa  iety of the same Plays and kept up the Pleasure which might otherwise grow languidFor what Pleasure is not languid to SatietyThe Neglect which has been had for several Years past to this  Management  Mr  C Cibber  thinks is the Occasion of the Degradation of the present Theatres by the  Entertainments  they exhibit  "  C Cibber  's Life p  for when Plays are hackney'd out to the common People indifferently at any Theatre the best Actors will soon feel the Town h  s enough of them"  Hence he proves a Plu  al  y of Playhouses detrimental to the Stage unless a proportionable Number of good Authors could rise to give them all different Employments  "But while good Writers are so scarce and  undaunted Criticks  so plenty I am afraid a good Play and a blazing Star will be equal Rarities This indulging the Taste with several Theatres will amount to the same Variety as an Oeconomist would show who would have  two P  ldings  and  two Legs of Mutron  for the same Dinner"  Though this Simile has been inserted in many a Twopenny JestBook yet as it is admirably introduced I have again ventur'd to quote it But to resume the Thread of this History  "These two excellent Companies were both prosperous for some Time t  ll their Variety of Plays began to be exhausted then of Course the better Actors which the King's seem to have been allow'd could not fail of drawing greater Audiences Sir  William D'avenant  therefore Master of the  Duke's Company  introduced Musick to Action and a new Species of Plays call'd  Dramatick Opera's  "  I must here observe Mr  Cibber  says Sir  William  was  Master of the  Duke's Company  though in a Page before he said they were the  King  's This Inadvertance arises from his not rightly counting ONE TWO But he has  too bold a Disregard for Correctness which others set a Value on  It is with a little Compunction that I made this Remark yet  Amicus  SOCRATES  Amicus  PLATO  sed magis amica  VENTAS  "  C Cibber  's Life p    This sensual Supply of Sight and Sound coming into the weaker Party they grew too hard for Sense and simple Nature for more People can see and hear than think and judge This Change of Taste fell heavy on the  King  's Company they had Truth on their Side and Praise for their Action but 'tis  cold  Comfort  Laudatur Alget  Unprofitable Praise can hardly give it a  Soup Maigre  In this Rivalship of the two Houses  Mohun  and  Hart  growing old and the young Actors impatient to get into their Parts and intractable the Audience likewise falling off at both Houses the two Companies were united into one exclusive of all others in the Year "  or according to  Downes  's Chronology This Union says the  Apologist  was however so much in Favour of the  Duke  's Company that  Hart  left the Stage upon itThe old  Prompter  says  "  Downes's Roscius Anglicanuus  Upon this Union Mr  Hart  being the  Heart  of the Company under Mr  Killegrew  's Patent never acted more by Reason of his Malady being afflicted with the Stone and Gravel of which he died some time after having a Salary of  forty Shillings  a Week to the Day of his Death"  One Theatre was now in Possession of the whole Town and the united Patentees imposed their own Terms on the Players The Actors who have always as quick a Sense of Injuries and as high and glorious a Love of Freedom as any People whatever appeal'd for Redress to the Lord Chamberlain who was then my Lord  Dorset  who finding their Complaints just procured  from King  William  in a separate License for Mr  Congreve  Mr  Betterton  Mrs  Barry  Mrs  Br  girdle  and others to set up a new Company calling it the  New Theatre  in  LincolnsInnFields  and they open'd it the last Day of  April  with a n  w Comedy call'd  Love for Love  Mr  Colley Cibber  begins his Account of the Actors from his entering upon the Stage which were the Remains of what was call'd the  Duke's Company  but is quite silent as to the  King's Company  whom he allows to have been their Superiors I shall therefore in this  Apology  for  my Life  be bold enough to supply that Defect in the  Apology  for  his  It may be said perhaps  "What Is this apologizing for your Lives  Well Sir  Critick  Suppose we call it so What then But to the Purpose  The Company acting under Mr  Killegrew  consisted of the following  Actors  and  Actresses  MEN  Mr  Theophilus Bird  Mr  Hart  Mr  Mohun  Mr  Lacy  Mr  Burt  Mr  Ca  twright  Mr  Chun  Mr  Shorterell  Mr  Kynaston  Mr  Wintersell  Mr  Griffin  Mr  Goodman  Mr  Lyddoll  WOMEN  Mrs  Carey  Mrs  Marshall  Mrs  Uphill  Mrs  Knep  Mrs  Hughes  And sometime after came into this Company  Mrs  Bout  ll  Mrs  Ellen Gwin  Mrs  James  Mrs  Rutter  Mrs  Knight  These Actors and Actresses were professedly excellent and who could have been no  Imitators  but all  Originals  for which Reason it may be much doubted if they have been since equall'd It is impossible for me to give an Account of their Perfections after the elaborate Manner Mr  Cibber  has of some others who succeeded them but if any Regard is to be paid to the Judgment of the Audi  nces and Authors of their  Time they must have excell'd highly in Parts which we see them cast to in the best Plays of that Time  Hart  was the Standard to which  Mountford  and  Wilks  endeavour'd and with great Success to arrive at yet are said not thoroughly to attain it  Mohun  was form'd for an artful Sterness in Tragedy and had great Talents in Comedy He was the original  Ventidius  in Mr  Dryden  's  All for Love  and was eminent for the  Volpone  of  Ben Johnson  Mrs  Marshall  Mrs  Ellen Gwin  and Mrs  Boutell  were equally admir'd in Tragedy and Comedy To give the Reader who has any Knowledge of Theatric Performances the best Idea I am able of these Actors I will transcribe the Cast of two or three Plays in which they peculiarly excell'd and which still continue to be acted on the Stage  The FOX  Volpone  Major  Mohun  Mosca  Mr  Hart  Corbacchio  Mr  Cartwright  Voltore  Mr  Shatterell  Corvino  Mr  Burt  Sir  Politick Wou'dbe  Mr  Lacy  Peregrine  Mr  Kynaston  Lady  Wou'dbe  Mrs  Corey  Celia  Mrs  Marshall  OTHELLO  Othello  Mr  Hart  Brabantio  Mr  Cartwright  Cassio  Mr  Burt  Iago  Major  Mohun  Roderigo  Mr  Shatterell  Desdemona  Mrs  Hughes  Emilia  Mrs  Rutter  Earl of ESSEX  The Earl of  Essex  Mr  Clark  The E of  Southampton  Mr  Griffin  Lord  Burleig    Major  Mo  un  Queen  Elizabeth  Mrs  Gwin  I come now to speak of in the same transitory Manner Sir  William D'avenant  's Company and of the Persons who compos'd it Mr  Rhodes  as I mention'd before form'd a Company of which the following Names is a compleat List  MEN  Mr  Betterton  Sheppy  Lov  il  illison  Underhill  Turner  Dix  n  Robert No  es  These Six acted WOMENS Parts  Mr  Kynaston  James Nokes  Angell  William Berterton  Mosely  Floyd  On Sir  William D'avenant  's getting a Patent from the King and forming this odd Band into a more regular Manner he took in these following Actors  Mr  Harris  Mr  P  e  Mr  Richards  Mr  Blayden  Mr  S  ith  Mr  Sandford  Mr  Medbourne  Mr  T  u  g  Mr  Norris  To these he added the following Actresses the four first of which he boarded in his own House  Mrs  D  v  nport  Mrs  Saunderson  Mrs  Gibbs  Mrs  Norris  Mrs  Davies  Mrs  Long  Mrs  Holden  Mrs  Jennings  Thus this Company stood in the Year but having lost several of the Actors by Death and some by Love it was recruited in the Year by Mr  Anthony Leigh  Mr  Jevon  Mr  Percival  and Mr  Williams  who came in a Boy and serv'd Mr  H  rris  and Mr  Boman  a Boy likewise Among the new Women  were Mrs  Barry  Mrs  Currer  Mrs  Butler  and others  Though I may seem impertinently prolix yet by some this  Theatric Chronology  will be thought not unnecessary and it is in fact a proper Introduction to that Part of Theatrical History which Mr  C Cibber  has very copio  sly related and of which I shall here give a Sort of an Abstract for this with my own Account will make a perfect  Compendium  of  Stage History  Thus he writes  "In the Year when I first came into this Company the principal Actors then at the Head of it were  Of MEN  Mr  Betterton  Mr  Mountford  Mr  Kynaston  Mr  Sandford  Mr  Nokes  Mr  Underhill  and  Mr  Leigh  Of WOMEN  Mrs  Betterton  Mrs  Barry  Mrs  Leigh  Mrs  Butler  Mrs  Mountford  and  Mrs  Bracegirdle  Betterton  was an Actor as  Shakespear  was an Author both without Competitors form'd for the mutual Assistance and Illustration of each other's Genius The one was born only to speak what the other only knew to write But to give a more clear Idea of him You have seen a  Hamlet  perhaps who on the first Appearance of his Father's Spirit has thrown himself into all the straining Vociferations requisite to express Rage and Fury and the House has thunder'd with Applause though the misguided Actor was  tearing a Passion into Rags  Now  Betterton  threw this Scene into another Light He open'd it with a Pause of mute Amusement then rising slowly to a solemn trembling Voice he made the Ghost equally terrible to the Spectator as to himself and in the descriptive Part of the natural Emotions which the ghastly Vision gave the Boldness of his Expostulations were still govern'd by Decency manly but not braving his Voice never rising into that seeming Outrage or wild Defiance of what he naturally rever'd  A farther Excellence  Betterton  had was that he could vary his Spirit to the different Characters he acted Those wild impatient Starts that fierce and flashing Fire which he threw into  Hotspur  never came from the unruffied Temper of  Brutus  for I have seen more than once a  Brutus  as warm as  Hotspur  When the  Betterton Brutus  was provok'd in his Dispute with  Cassius  his Spirit flew only to his Eye his steady Look alone supply'd that Terror which he disdain'd an Intemperance of Voice should rise to Thus with a settled Dignity of Contempt like an  unheeding Rock  he repell'd upon himself the Foam of  Cassius  Perhaps the Words of  Shakespear  will better let you into my Meaning  Must I give Way and Room to your rash Choler  S  all I be frighted when a Madman stares  And a little after  There is no Terror  Cassius  in your Looks  c  But with whatever Strength of Nature we see the Poet show at once the Philosopher and the Hero yet the Image of the Actor's Excellence unless Language could put Colours into our Words to paint the Voice with  Et si vis Similem pingere pinge Sonum  is an Impossibility  Besides these Characters he shewed an  extraordinary Power  in  blowing  ALEXANDER  into a Blaze of Almi  ation  yet the furious Fustian and turged Rants in that Character he was sensible gain'd a false Applause only for he thought no Applause equal to an attentive Silence that there were many Ways of deceiving an Audience into a loud one but to keep them hu  'd and quiet was an Applause which only Truth and Merit could arrive at But if Truth and Merit were only applauded how many noisy Actors would shake their Plumes with Shame who from an injudicious Approbation of the Multitude have strutted and bawl'd in the Place of Merit  Betterton  had a Voice of that Kind which gave more Spirit to Terror than to the softer Passions of more Strength than Melody The Rage and Jealousy of  Othello  became him better than the Sighs and Tenderness of  Castalio  for though in  Castalio  he only excell'd others in  Othello  he excell'd himself The Person of this excellent Actor was suitable to his Voice more manly than sweet not exceeding the middle Stature inclining to the Corpulent of a serious penetrating Aspect his Limbs nearer the athletick than the delicate Proportion yet however form'd there rose from the Harmony of the Whole a commanding Mein of Majesty which the fairerfac'd Darlings of his Time ever wanted something to be Masters of The last Part he acted was  Melantius  in the  Maid's Tragedy  for his own Benefit when being suddenly seiz'd with the Gout he submitted by extraordinary Applications to have his Foot so far reliev'd that he might be able to walk on the Stage in a Slipper rather than wholly disappoint his Audience He was observ'd that Day to have exerted a more than ordinary Spirit and met with a suitable Applause but the unhappy Consequence of tampering with his Distemper was that it flew into his Head and kill'd him in three Days in the th Year of his Age"  This is the chief Account which Mr  Cibber  gives of  Betterton  he has indeed interspers'd several Theatric Observations which amount to no more than they who  write  can't  read  and they who  read  can't  act  Mr  Dryden  could not read his own  Amphitrion  yet  Nat Lee  read his Scenes so well that  Mohun  cry'd out  Unless I were able to  PLAY  my Part as well as you  READ  it to what Purpose should I take it  Yet  Nat Lee  attempted to be an Actor but soon left the Stage in despair of making a profitable Figure there  I could on this Head add several curious  Anecdotes  of my  own  and from Experience in the Stage Affairs prove that as some who  write  can't  read  so there are others who  read  that can't  write  and yet some who can both  read act  and  write  How far indeed these  reading writing acting Qualifications  may be conjoin'd in one and the same Person this  Apologetical History  as well as that of Mr  Colley Cibber  will be some humble kind of  Demonstration of  Some indeed may think that by these Memoirs  we  may  blaze to Pesterity in a ludicrou  Lustre  and that our Observations and Digressions  signify roundly N  thing  yet to the Drum of the Ear will I as roundly rattle  A  FICO  for thy Criticism vile Wight  You say we Print indeed yet cannot Write  I myself I and Father print indeed  But what we print we wrote and what we wrote you read  But  h  lt a little  I had something to say on the above Description of  Betterton  It may be in the greatest Part or even in the whole just yet is it not carrying the Elogium too far to think nor  Hart  nor  Mohun  nor any in their Company nor some before them equal'd him perhaps surpass'd him Mr  Cibber  says none has since arriv'd at his Perfections this very possily may be yet very likely every succeeding Age will think in the same Manner of other Actors As Mr  Hart  and  Mohun  's Excellencies were forgot by Degrees Mr  Betterton  's arose when his fail'd by his Death Mr  Booth  was thought to be a very great Successor In short they who remember  Betterton  shake their Heads at  Booth  they that are in full Memory of  Booth  with pitiful Scorn see some  modern Performers  who half a Century hence may be highly admir'd in their Turn in Prejudice to  Vide C Cibber  's Apology  New Al  pts  in the Profession This say what you will is a prejudice of Nature the Impressions we first receive are so deeply affecting that even having Judgment afterwards it imposes on it Prejudices in  theatrical Affairs  are as imperceptibly got and as obstinately maintain'd as those in  Religion  and we may say of the first Representation we see what  says of our first Education  By Education most Men are misled  We so believe because we so were bred  The Priest continues what the Nurse began  And thus the  Child  imposes on the  Man  But really  Betterton  besides his Excellencies of  Nature  and  Judgment  and other great Advantages for though he is call'd an  Original  he had seen all the  old Players  who were very excellent and those were remembered who were  Originals  of  Shakespear  What Aid such Remembrance might be take from the following  Anecdotes  "  Downs  's Account of the Stage  In the Tragedy of  Hamlet  says old  Downes  the Part of  Hamlet  was perform'd by Mr  Betterton  Sir  William D'avenant  having seen Mr  Taylor  of the  BlackFryars  Company act it who was instructed by the Author Mr  Shakespear  taught Mr  Betterton  in  every Article  of it which by his exact Performance of it gain'd him Esteem and Reputation superlative to all other Plays"  Thus again this ancient but faithful  Memoirist  delivers himself concerning the Play of  Henry the Eighth  "The Part of the King was all new cloath'd in a proper Habit and so right and justly done by Mr  Betterton  he being instructed in it by Sir  William D'avenant  who had it from old Mr  Lowen  that had his Instructions from Mr  Shakespear himself  that I dare and will aver none can or will come near him in this Age in the Performance of that Part  The Reader will observe that in  theatrical Memoirists  a Simplicity of Stile in plain Narration too often occurs but he will pardon this bold Disregard for grammatical Correctness if thro' our Rapidity of Thought he investigates the Meaning He will see then how in  Hamlet  Mr  Betterton  came by that Judgment which Mr  Cibber  takes up some Pages in extolling he will find those Actors who have been  Originals  in Parts are thought to have excell'd to the highest Degree And Mr  Betterton  might have been as excellent in those  Parts in which he was an  Original  as any other Actor before him yet an Actor after him who has an  original  Part and consequently thereby becomes an  Origin  l  may be thought so far to excel that few Actors while he is remember'd shall with any equal  judicious Approbation  succeed in that PartOn the whole  original Parts  make an  Actor  and they who have seen a perfect set of Actors can only judge of succeeding ones by them The  Laudator temporis acti  Is not merely confin'd to old Men by natural Prejudice we catch this Apurtenance to old Age when we have scarce pass'd the Verge of Youth But to conclude of Mr  Betterton  with a greater Compliment than any other paid him though the Epilogue to his last Benefit wrote by Mr  Rowe  was a very good one take this Description of him from a Prologue of  Dryden  He like the setting Sun still shoots a glimm'ry Ray  Like ancient  Rome  majestic in Decay  Mr  C Cibber  's long Digression has led me into this but as in his Account of  Betterton  his Sentiments on theatrical Ac  ion are chiefly express'd I have ventur'd to subjoin these Sentiments of mine to his Account that I may not be so tedious on this Subject in another Place I shall now

A few Words to critical Auditors  _IT was before observ'd Women were not admitted on the Stage till after the Restoration yet by the Lists I have given you will find they were not so very easily supply'd for in the Company where  Betterton  was engag'd they were forc'd still to put young Men into female Characters and Mr  Kynaston  stands first in that motley Cast nor indeed had they any till Sir  William D'avenant  brought them to that Company On the contrary the  Old  or the  King's Company  under  Killegrew  had at first setting out some Women who in the Summer of King  Charles  the Second's Reign even when the Companies were in their highest Prosperity were thought inimitable How hard then is it to fix unlimited Excellence to particular Persons But of these  Male Women Kynaston  was esteem'd being very young and handsome and according to  Downes  's Phrase  Downes  's  Roscius Anglicanus    a compleat Female StageBeauty performing his Parts so well especially  Arthiope  and  Aglaura  Parts greatly moving Compassion and Pity that it is doubted whether any Woman that succeeded him so sensibly touch'd the Audience  Behold the Doatage of  servile Partiality  Mr  Cibber  speaks of his Beauty and his performing  Evadne  in the  Maid's Tragedy  to which he subjoins a facetious Incident which those Shifts once occasion'd  Vide C Cibber  's Apology p  King  Charles  coming to a Tragedy sooner than usual and was impatient to have the Performance  begin and sent to know the Meaning of their Delay the Master of the Company came to the Box and thinking the best excuse would be the Truth fairly told his Majesty the Queen was not yet shav'd The King laugh'd and staid till her Majesty could be effeminatedBut as for  Kynaston  he was so beautiful that the Ladies of Quality prided themselves in taking him with them in their Coaches in this theatrical Habit after the Play which in those Days began at four o' ClockSuch a Custom of the Ladies of carrying such a handsome young Fellow though in Petticoats in their Coaches with them without any Apprehension of Censure is as strong an Instance as possible to what Height the modish Gallantry of that Time was carried  But even on Mr  Kynaston  's changing Sexes that is his Petticoats to the Buskin and his Stays to the Truncheon he still remained famous He had it seems a formal Gravity in his Mein which in some Characters became him His Eye was piercing and in Characters of heroick Life led in his Tone of Voice an imperious Vivacity that truely depicted the Tyrant In these two Parts  Morat  in  Aurengzebe  and  Muley Moloch  in  Sebastian  he had a fierce  Lyonlike Majesty  in his Utterance that gave the Spectator a Kind of trembling AdmirationIn  Henry the Fourth  he was a Master of a different Majesty but of so true a Kind that when he whisper'd the following Line to  Hotspur  Send us your Prisoner or you'll hear of it  He conveyed more Menace than the loudest Intemperance of Voice could swell to  Kynaston  like  Betterton  strictly followed the Rules of Truth and Nature yet what seem'd surprising they were as different in their Manner of acting as in their personal Form and Features He stay'd too long on the Stage till his Memory and Spirits fail'd him his latter Imperfections were not his own but those of decaying Nature  Vide C Cibber  's Apology p  Mountsord  was a younger Man tall wellmade of agreeable Aspect fair his Voice clear full and melodious In Tragedy a most affecting Lover his Words had that  Softness  that  Like Flakes of feather'd Snow  They melted as they fell  In Comedy he gave the truest Life to what we call the fine Gentleman in Scenes of Gaiety he never broke into the Regard that was due to the Presence of equal or superior Characters though inferior Actors play'd them He fill'd the Stage not by elbowing and crossing it before others or disconcerting their Action but by surpassing them in Time and masterly Touches of Nature He never laugh'd at his own Jest unless the Point of his Raillery requir'd it He had besides such a Variety of Genius that he could throw off the Man of Sense for the brisk vain rude lively Coxcomb hence he excell'd in Sir  Courtly Nice  His whole Man his Voice Mein and Gesture was no longer  Mountsord  but another Person there the insipid soft Civility the elegant and formal Mein the drawling delicacy of Voice the stately Flatness of his Address and the empty Eminence of his Attitudes were so nicely observed and guarded that had he not been an entire Master of Nature had he not kept his Judgment as it were a Centinel upon himself not to admit the least Likeness of what he us'd to be to enter into any Part of his Performance he could not possibly have so compleately finish'd it He was kill'd in the thirtythird Year of his Age the Accidents that more particularly attended his Fall are to be sound at large in the Trial of the Lord  Mohun  printed among  those  of the  State  in  Folio  Vide C Cibber  's Apology p  Sandsord  was what Mr  Cibber sen  calls the  Spagnolet  of the Theatre An excellent Actor in disagreeable Characters that is he was the Stage Villain but this happen'd not so much by his own Choice as Necessity for having a low crooked Person such bodily Defects were too strong to be admitted into great and amiable Characters so that in any new or reviv'd Play if there was a hateful or mischievous one  Sandsord  had no Competitor for it This personating of bad Characters requir'd as much Art and Judgment as to have  shone  into the  Applause  of the  Spectators  by all the  Throws  and  Swellings of Ambition  yet it was attended with this Dilemma that an Audience never expected to see him in any  other Nay so far was this Prejudice carried which Mr  Cibber  has heard was Fact A new Play came on the Stage in which  Sandford  play'd an honest Statesman the Pit sat out three or four Acts in a quiet Expectation that the Honesty of  Sandford  should from his diffembling it for they thought him a Rogue at the Bottom  animate the Scenes to come with Confusion  But finding him in Truth an  honest Statesman  they fairly damn'd the Play  as if the Author had impos'd on them a most fruitless Absurdity  This  oral Tradition  has in it a Proof as ali oral Traditions have that much Faith is requir'd in the Reader Might not the last Act in this Play have some other  Catastrophe  in it than  Sandford  's proving an honest StatesmanNo so the Story was heard and so it must be believ'd  Credat Judaeus Apella  Non ego  From  Sandford  's being so successful a Stage Villian the inferior Actors thought his Success owing to the Defects of his Person and from thence when they appear'd as  Bravo  's and Murderers made themselves as frightful and inhuman Figures as possibleIn King  Charles  's Time says our  ane  doring Apologist  this low Skill was carried to such Extravagance that the King who was black brow'd and of a swarthy Complexion pass'd a pleasant Remark on observing the grim Murderers in  M  cbeth  when turning to his People in the Box he said  Pray what is the Meaning that we never see a Rogue in a Play but God'sfish they clap him on a black Periwig When it is well known one of the greatest Rogues in the Kingdom always wears a fair one  The King's Observation says Mr  C Cibber  was just tho' the King had been as fair as  Adonis  What Complexion that pretty Fellow  Adonis  had I will not determine yet I know not how it is or what  Ideas  People conceive of  Black  but it certainly has a very  Horrormoving Aspect  It may be a  Trick  of the  Stage  and as such laugh'd at for I allow very great Rascals may have very  black Hearts  who wear very fair Perukes Mr  C Cibber  thinks his swarthy Majesty alluded  to some great Man out of Power and leave them to  guess at  him who  remember the changing Complexion of his Ministers  This charming Observation shows the Folly of Allusion for suppose  Somebody  now living had said the said Sentence who among the present Ministry would dare six on a Man who wore a light Wig Their Eyes might indeed naturally be converted to that great Man who wore the greatest lightcolour'd Wig and so might guess at himwho was a very honest ManBut tho' political  ministerial Inuendoes  may be very justly prov'd to mean something yet theatrical Inuendoes are a mere  Inanity of Thought  But to digress from this Digressionand to enter into anotherMany Actors and Actresses have made it a Point to play a Character flatly written because they stood in the favourable Light of Honour and Virtu  A Lady  Vide C Cibber  's Apology p  Mr  Cibber sen  says who was a  Damoselle de Plasir  on the Stage acted a Part of impregnable Chastity and bid the Ladies  Study to live the Character I play  Yet this good Creature made  Faut Paux  she had some illegitimate Issue and her Chastiry off the Stage was not impregnable Many are the same Kind of theatric Prudes now living who are like enough to think that to seem virtuous is sufficient for an Audience and would make it a Point to be for half an hour most pure Virgins on the Stage whatever kind coming dear consenting Creatures they might prove after the Curtain had drop'dI could enumerate some  dainty  modern Proofs of this theatric Prudery but give me Leave to change an old Apothegm  De vivis nil nisi bonum  To return to  C Cibber  's Description of  Sandford  his  'Manner of Speaking vary'd from those before describ'd His Voice was acute and had a piercing Tone which scruck every Syllable distinctly upon the Ear and in his Look he mark'd to an Audience what he thought worth more thon their ordinary Notice Had he liv'd in  Shakespear  's Time I am confident his Judgment must have chose him to have play'd  Richard  ill for without considering  his Person he had an un  outh Stateliness in his Motion a harsh sullen Pride in his Speech a meditating Brow a stern Aspect occasionally changing into an almost l  dicrous Triumph over Goodness and Virtue from thence falling into a most assuasive Sullenness and soothing Candoar of a designing Heart'  This Actor Mr  C Cibber  inmated closely and hit his Manner so true in  Richard the Third  that Sir  John Vanbrugh  said on his playing that Part  You have his very Look Gait and Speech and every Motion of him and have borrowed them all only to serve you in that Character  They who remember Mr  Cibber  in that Part have a Copy of  Sandsord  Ex pede Herculem  To describe the low Comedians Mr  Cibber  makes a peculiar Apology yet thus after it is over he goes on  Vide C Cibber  's Apology p  N  kes  had a Genius different from any  read heard of  or  seen since  or  before  his Time his Excellence a plain palpable Simplicity of Nature that he was as unaccountably diverting in his common Speech as on the the Stage This Simplicity so easy to  Nokes  no one could ever catch  Leigh  and  Underhill  have been well copied though not equall'd by others But not all the mimical Skill of  Estcourt  nor my own could reach the  vis Comica  of  Nokes  though I never saw an Actor beside himself whom I could not at least so far imitate as to give a more than tolerable Notion of his MannerThe Characters he shone in were  Sir Martin Marall Gomez  in the  Spanish Fryar  Sir  Nicholas Cully  in  Love in a Tub Sofia  in the  Amphitrion c c c  This was the Effect of his Action he never entered the Stage but he was receiv'd with an  involuntary Applause  not by Hands for they might be  prostituted  and  bespoken  but by a Laughter  which if bespoken could not be prostituted  which his Sight provok'd and Nature could not resistHis Person was of the middle Size his Voice clear his natural Countenance grave and sober when he spoke that seriousness of Joakery was discharg'd and a dry drolling Levity took such full Possession of him that I can only  refer the Idea of him to your Imagination In his low Characters that became it he had a shuffling Shame in his Gait with so contented an Ignorance in his Aspect and aukward Absurdity in his Gesture that had you not known him you could not have believ'd he had a Grain of common Sense In a word I am tempted to sum up the Character of  Nokes  as a Comedian in a Parody of what  Shakespear  's  Mark Antony  says of  Brutus  as a Heroe  His Life was Laughter and the  Ludicrous  So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up  And say to all the World  This was an  Actor  Leigh  was of the mercurial Kind not a strict Imitator of Nature yet not so wanton in his Performance as to be wholly out of her Sight In Humour he lov'd to take a full Career but was careful to stop short when just upon the Precipice He so excell'd in the  Spanish F  yar  that the Duke of  Dorset  had his Picture drawn in a whole Length in that Character by  Kneller  and the whole Portrait is extremely like him He was much admir'd by King  Charles  who us'd to call him  his Actor  He died of the Fever a Week after  Montford  in  December    Underhill  was a natural Comedian whose Excellence lay in Characters of still Life the stiff t  e heavy and the stupid in some of these he look'd as if it were not in the Power of human Passions to alter a Feature of them A Countenance of Wood could not be more fix'd than his when the Blockhead of a Character required it His Face was full and long from his Crown to End of his Nose was the shorter Half of it so that the Disproportion of his lower Features when soberly composed with an  unwandering Eye  hanging over them threw him into the most lumpish moping Mortal that ever made Beholders merry not but at other Times he could be awaken'd into Spirit equally ridiculousIn the coa  se rustick Humour of Justice  Clodpole  in  Epsom Wells  he was a  delightful Bru  e  His Age oblig'd him to leave the Stage some Years before he died he appeared once indeed in a Part he had been famous for the  Gravedigger  in  Hamlet  but ceasing to  be what he had been his Infirmities were dismiss'd with Pity He soon after died a superannuated Pensioner of the Theatre Thus far Mr  C Cibber  The Characters of these Actors are an Extract from the Apology of Mr  C Cibber  and were the Impressions he receiv'd in his Youth How far he may or may not entertain a Prejudice from thence I shall not here examine They might be so very excellent as he says of  Betterion  to excell themselves But might not as great Descriptions be given of the chief Performers in  Hart  and  Mo  un  's Company by some other Historian Or might not some  modern  History give much such Characters of our  present Actors  who are most in Vogue with the Town Surely such an Attempt might not  regret  the present or the future Reader I shall therefore in a future Chapter undertake so bold a Province though the  Flatness  of my Characters may be  unequal  to those of the great Apologist which are said to be of the  prosound Sublime  The same Liberty which I have taken with Mr  Cibber  's Gentlemen I shall take with his Ladies and for the same Reason I have before given After saying  Powell Verbruggen  and  Williams  were not worth speaking of he comes to  Mrs  Barry  who was in Possession of most of the chief Parts of Tragedy How she excell'd in them you may judge from Mr  Dryden  's saying in his Preface to  Cleomenes  she had gain'd a Reputation beyond any Woman he had seen on the Stage which Mr  Cibber  corroborates with his own Judgment Mrs  Barry  it seems did not arrive at this Maturity of Power and Judgment till she was more than a little past her Youth whence our Apologist observes that the  short Life of 'Beauty is not long enough to form a complete Actress  The Fame Mrs  Barry  arriv'd to is a Proof of the Difficulty in judging with Certainty whether any young People will ever make any great Figure in a Theatre for Mrs  Barry  was discharg'd at the End of the Year as an useless Expence Mrs  Oldfield  had been above a Year before she gave any Hope of her being an Actress so unlike to all Manner of Propriety was her speaking But however both made themselves complete Mistresses  of their Art by the Prevalence of their Understanding"  Mrs  Barry  in Characters of Greatness had a Presence of elevated Dignity her Mein and Motion superb and gracefully majestic her Voice full clear and strong so that no Violence of Passion could be too much for her And when Distress or Tenderness possessed her she subsided into the most affecting Melody and Softness Of the former of these Excellencies she gave the most delightful Prooss in all the heroic Plays of  Dryden  and  Lee  and in the latter in the softer Passions of  Otway  's  Monimia  and  Belvidera  In Scenes of Anger Defiance and Resentment while she was impetuous and terrible she pour'd out the Sentiment with enchanting  Harmony  She was the first Person whose merit was distinguished by the Indulgence of having an annual  Benefit Play  which was granted to her in King  James  the d's Time and became not in common to others till the Division of the Company after the Death of King  William  's Queen  Mary  This great Actress died toward the latter End of Queen  Ann  The Year says our Historian you may guess at by an Expression which fell from her in Blank Verse when she was delirious  Ha ha and so they make us Lords by Dozens  Mrs  Betterton  was in the Year when Mr  Cibber senior  first came upon the Stage far advanc'd in Years yet so great a Mistress of Nature that even Mrs  'Barry  who acted Lady  Macbeth  after her could not in that Part with her superior Strength and Melody of Voice throw out those quick and careful Strokes of Terror from the Disorder of a guilty Mind which the other gave us with a Facility in her Manner that rendered them at once tremendous and delightful Time could not impair her Skill though it had brought her Person to Decay She was to the last the Admiration of all true Judges of Nature and  Shakespear  in whose Plays she chiefly excell'd without a Rival She was a Woman of an unblemish'd sober Life and had the Honour to teach Queen  Anne  when Princess the Part of  Semandra  in  Mith  idates  which she acted at  Court in Kg  Charles  's Time After the Death of Mr    her Husband that  Princess  when  Que  n  order'd her a Pension for Life but she liv'd not to receive but one half Year of it  Mrs  Leigh  the Wife of Mr  Leigh  the Comedian beforementioned had a droll Way of dressing the pretty Folbles of superannuated Beauties She had in herself a good Deal of Humour and knew how to infuse it into the affected Mothers Aunts and affected sta  e Maids that had  miss'd their Market  In these she was extremely entertaining and  painted  in a  lively Manner  the  blind Side  of Nature  Mrs  Butler  was recommended to the Stage by King  Charles  She was the Daughter of a decay'd Knight and proved a good Actress and was besides in those Days allowed to Sing and Dance in Perfection In speaking her sweetton'd Voice with her naturally genteel Air and her sensible Pronunciation rendered her wholly Mistress of the  Amiable  in many serious Characters In Parts of Humour she had a Manner of blending her  assuasive Softness  even with the Gay the Lively and Alluring as in the second  Constantia  in the  Chances  in which Mrs  Oldfield  's lively Performance did not equal  ers She having only Shillings a Week and being denied the Addition of ten more she went with Mr  Ashbury  to  Dublin  who offered her any Conditions  Mrs  Montford  whose second Marriage gave her the Name of  Verbruggen  was a Mistress of more Variety of Humour than I ever knew in any one Woman Actress This Variety was attended with equal Vivacity which made her excellent in Characters extremely different Nothing though ever so barren if within the bounds of Nature could be  flat in her Hands  She was fond of Humour in what low Part s  ver found and would make no Scruple of defacing her fair Form to come heartily into it for when she was eminent in several desirable Characters of Wit and Humour she would descend from high Life into low Characters with as much Fancy as when triumphing in all the Airs and vain Gr  ces of a fine Lady In a Play of  D'urfey  's  call'd the  Western Lass  which Part she acted she transformed her whole Being Body Shape Voice Language Look and Features into almost another Animal with a strong  Devonshire  Dialect a broad laughing Voice a poking Head round Shoulders an unconceiving Eye and the most bedizz'ning dowdy Dress that ever covered the untrain'd Limbs of a  Joan Troit  To have seen her here you would have thought it had been impossible the same Creature could ever have been recovered to what was easy to her the gay the lively and desirable Nor was her Humour limited to her Sex for while her Shape permitted she was a more adroit  She was thought so excellent in these Characters and Dr  ss that Mr  Southern  wrote the Comedy call'd  Sir Anthony Love  which Character she perform'd on purpose for her  pretty Fellow than is usually seen upon the Stage Her easy Air Action Mein quite chang'd from the Coif to the cock'd Hat and Cavalier in Fashion People were so fond of seeing her a Man that when the Part of  Bays  in the  Rehearsal  had for some Time lain dormant she was desired to take it up which she acted with all true coxcombly Spirit and Humour that the Sufficiency of the Character requir'd  After an  Apology  which the  Apologist  makes for describing Mrs  Bracegirdle  now living he introduces her into his Apology which is sufficient Authority for me to give an Abstract of that Paragraph in mine  Mrs  Bracegirdle  was now  blooming  to her  Maturity  her Reputation as an Actress gradually rising with that of her Person Never was any Woman in such general Favour which to the last Scene of Dramatick Life she maintained by not being unguarded in her private CharacterThis Discretion made her the  Cara  the Darling of the Theatre She had indeed no greater Claim to Beauty than the most desirable  Brunette  might pretend to but her Youth and lively Aspect threw out such a Glow of Health and Chearfulness that on the Stage few Spectators that  were not past it  could behold her without  Desire  In all the chief Parts  she acted the  Desirable was so pred  minant  that  no Judge could be cold enough to consider from what other particular Excellence she became delightful  To speak critically of an Actress extremely good were as hazardous as to be positive in ones Opinion of the best  Opera Singer  We can only appeal to  Taste  and of  Taste  there can be no  disputing  I shall therefore only say that most eminent Authors always chose her for their favourite Character and shall leave that Proof of her Merit to its own Value  She retir'd from the Stage in the Height of her Favour when most of her Cotemporaries she was bred up with were declining in the Year She play'd once after the Part of  Angelica  in  Love for Love  for the Benefit of her old Friend Mrs  Betterton  Here Mr  Colley Cibber  closes his Account of these memorable Actors of which I have given a Quotation of great Fidelity as to the Matter of Fact chiefly contain'd but many are the Prettinesses Daintinesses Rhetorical Flowers vivisying Images Floods of fine Language and Rapidities of Wit which are all like his  clear Emanation of Beauty  they  strike  you into a  Regard  that has something different from  Respect  As I am so greatly indebted to him for this Chapter I shall follow my old Way and till we settle Accounts still run myself more into his Books therefore what he says from his  Word  to the  critical Auditors  I will borrow a  or  Two  and then again  digress  to  myself  "Th  s Account may inform or assist the Judgment of  uture Spectators it may be of Service to their publick Entertainment  for as their Hearers are so will the Actors be worse or better as true or false Taste applauds or discommends them  Hence only  can our Theatres improve or must degenerate Yet there is another Point which I recommend to the Consideration which is that the extreme Severity with which they damn a bad Play seems so terrible a Warning to those whose untry'd Genius might hereafter give them a good one But the Vivacity of our modern Criticks is of late grown so riotous an unsuccessful Author has no more Mercy shewn him than  a notorious Cheat in the Pillory Every Fool the lowest Member of the Mob becomes a Wit  this is the Case while the Theatre is so turbulent a Sea and so infested with Pirates what Poetical Merchant of any Substance would venture to trade in it In a Word these Criticks seem to me like the Lions Whelps in the  Tower  who are so  boisterously  gamesome at their Meals they dash down their Bowls of Milk brought for their own Breakfast"  I have a Word also to give to these critical Auditors these  LionCubs  these  Pirates  in our Seas but that will fall more naturally in some subsequent Chapter  CHAP VI  A State of the Stage continu'd  _HAVING resolv'd to make these Memoirs in some Manner contain the  Utile Dulci  what by Abstracts from Mr  Cibber  's History and what by my own History the Readers will find a succinct Account of the Stage from the Year to I shall not indeed prove so descanting an Author as that great Man yet my compendious Breviary may be of some Use and Entertainment Of his elaborate Lucubrations mine are but an Epitome Let him be the  Trogus Pompeius  of the Stage I am contented to be the  Justinus  I am now entering into that Part of the History where the Theatre fell frequently in Labour of Revolutions In the Stage was under the Government of united Patentees who had under them so compleat a Set of Actors as has been described yet they were weak enough or the Taste of the Publick was so weak  as to Force them to it to exhibit Spectacle and the Expences they were at in  Dioclesian  and  King Arthur  though seemingly successful were so great that they run into Debt which found Work for the Court of Chancery twenty Years following These Exhibitions of Spectacle made Plays of Course neglected Actors hold cheap and slightly dress'd while Singers and Dancers were better paid and embroider'd These Measures of Course created Murmurings on one Side and ill Humo  r and Contempt on the other When it became necessary to lessen the Charge Resolution was taken to begin with the Players Salaries  Nokes Montford  and  Leigh  all died this same Year yet they chose rather to distress the surviving Actors than encourage them To bring this about some of  Betterton  's Parts were given to  Powell  and some of Mrs  Barry  's to Mrs  BracegirdlePowell  accepted  Betterton  's but Mrs  Bracegirdle  denied  Barry  's  Betterton  on this form'd one Ass  ciation and the Patentees another During these Contentions Treaties of Peace were offered by the Actors but haughtily refused by the other The Publick naturally more b  ass'd to the Actors whom they see and are pleas'd by than Patentees whom they never see supported th  ir Interest and Persons of the highest Distinction entertained the King in his Circle about Affairs of the Theatre About this Time Queen  Mary  died and on such Occasion  all publick Diversions cease  Betterton  and his Adherents had now Leisure to sollicit Redress and collected a Company the Patentees being forced to a  cept such Actors as were the Leavings of  Betterton  On this the Patentees engag'd  Powell  and  Verbr  gg  n  and rais'd them from two to four Pounds a Week and besides the other Leavings were Mr  C Cibber  yet they were forc'd to recruit and beat up for Volunteers in distant Counties which brought  Johnson  and  Bull  ck  into the Service of the Theatre Royal Forces thus rais'd they open'd the Campaign  Betterton  by Subscription at the  LincolnsInnFields TennisCourt  the Pa  n  ees at  DruryLane  who took the Field first Mr  Ci  ber  writing their opening Prologue having no better Poet  "That memorable Day being as he says  the Day his Muse brought forth her first Fruit that was ever made publick how good or how bad imports not but he receiv'd for it two Guineas not being suffered to speak it himself"  The Patentees went on but lamely against the new Colony of Actors who were like the Commonwealth of  Holland  divided from the Tyranny of  Spain  But the Simile according to the Apologist is but very little farther a Simile for they found in a short Time they were never worse govern'd than when govern'd by themselves They began to consult private Interest more than the general Good and though some Deserence was paid to  Betterton  several wanted to govern in their Turns  C Cibber  's Apology  But is not the same Infirmity in StatesDogget  could not with Patience look on the  costly Trains  and  Plumes of Tragedy  in  which  knowing himself to be useless he though a vain Extravagance which when he could not oppose he came over to  DruryLaneBetterton  's Company began at last to lose Ground nor was  DruryLane  Company in very great Prosperity yet the Patentees had found out a Remedy against a thin House  viz  Ditto  p  Never to pay their People when the Money did not come in nor then neither but in such Proportion as suited their Conveniency  Such was the Fortune of both Companies when our  Mr  Rb  Father of the present Master of  CGarden  Theatre  Master who had practis'd the Law and therefore loved a Storm better than fair Weather thinking the Quality rather prefer'd the other Company than ours resolv'd to ingratiate himself with their Domesticks and open'd a Gallery for the Footmen  gratis  who were never before admitted into it till the fourth Act was over This he thought would get us a good Word in their respective Families and incite them to come all Hands aloft into the Crack of our Applauses Hence arose this Custom which ripen'd into Right and became the most disgraceful Nusance that ever depreciated a Theatre  About this Time Mr  Wilks  came from the  Dub  in  Company to  DruryLane Theatre  He first commenced an Actor by performing in a private Play at  Dublin  of which Country he was a Native He had been on  DruryLane  Stage before but qu  tted it to go to  Ireland  not rising  n Parts there according to his Ambition On his Return in  Montford  was dead and  Powell  in his chief Parts and the only Actor that stood in  Wilks  's Way They soon became avowed Rivals and without quoting their every Quarrel for Parts be it sufficient to say that  Wilks  by Industry Care and Sobriety gain'd the Favour of the Publick which  Powell  with more Merit by his Neglect and Intemperance forseited  On this Narration the Apologist observes that an Actor is disesteemed or favoured on the Stage more or less according as he has or has not a due Regard to his  private Life  and  Reputation  Nay  false Reports  shall affect him and become the  Cause  or  Pretence  of using him injuriously He gives this Instance in Regard to himself  "  C Cib  r  's Apology p  After the Success of the  Beggars Opera  I was so stupid to attempt the following Year something of the same Kind on a quite different Foundation to recommend Virtue and Innocence My newfangled Performance was call'd  Love in a Riddle  and was as vilely damn'd and hooted at as so vain a Presumption in the idle cause of Virtue cou'd deserve I will grant the  Beggars Opera  had more skilfully gratify'd the publick Taste than all the brightest Authors before him The same Author wrote a Second Part to his  Beggars Opera  and transported his Heroe beyond Sea but this was forbid to come on the Stage Soon after this Prohibition  my  Performance  was  to come on the Stage Great Umbrage was taken that I was permitted to have the whole Town to m  self by this absolute Forbiddance of what they had more Mind to be entertain'd with And some Days before my Bawble was acted I was inform'd a  strong Party would be made against it A Report it seems had ran against me that to make Success for my own Play I had privately found Means or Interest that the Second Part of the  Beggars  Opera should be suppress'd as if I a Comedian had been of Consequence enough to influence a great Officer of State to rob the Publick of an innocent Diversion  if it were such  that none but that cunning Comedian might entertain themBut against  blind  Malice and  staring  Inhumanity whatever is upon the Stage has no Defence There they knew I stood helpless and expos'dI had not consider'd  poor Devil  that from the Security of a full Pit Dunces might become Wits Cowards valiant and Prentices Gentlemen Whether such were concern'd in the Murder of my Play I am not certain I never endeavour'd to discover any of my Assassins I cannot afford them a better Name from their unmanly Manner of destroying it It faintly held up its wounded Head till the second Day and would have spoke for Mercy but was not suffered The Presence of the Royal Heir apparent could not protect it I therefore to stop their Clamour quitted the Actor for the Author and told them  That since they were not inclined this Play should go farther I gave them my Word that after this Night it should never be acted again but that in the mean Time I hoped they would consider in whose Presence they were and for that Reason at least would suspend what farther Marks of Displeasure they might think I had deserved  After a dead Silence and some little Pause some few Hands signify'd their ApprobationWhen the Play went on I observ'd about a dozen Persons of no extraordinary Appearance sullenly walk'd out of the Pit after which every Scene of it met with ApplauseBut it came too late  Peace to its Manes  Now tho' this was the only Tumult that I had known to have been so effectually appeas'd in fifty Years by any Thing that could be said to an Audience in the same Humour yet it was no Merit in me because when  like me you submit to their doing you all the Mischief they can they will at any Time be satisfied"  I have been more particular in the Length of this Question as it contains a curious Anecdote on damning  Love in a Riddle  and carries this Moral that a  Suspicion  of an Actor's doing a  base Action  may lay him open to very  severe  and  unjust  Punishments from an  Audience  This unjust Treatment not three Seasons ago became a certain Actor's Fortune to meet The Affair was of a  private Nature  and therefore was thought a  publick Audience  had no Right to take it under their Cognizance The Affair was this  There was a certain Ladya very fine Ladyto whom an Actor was once so fatally ally'd that the Law gave her a Privilege to call him HusbandHusbandO fatal Name This Lady was young beautiful sensible and virtuous when this Actor fell in Love with her She had appear'd on the Stage as a  Singer  and was esteem'd an admirable one This Actor who was at that Time at the Head of the theatric  Revolution  which brought back the old  DruryLane  Actors to their old House at  DruryLane  thought this young Woman had so much of the  amiable  and  virtuous  in her that without any other Consideration made her his Wife What connubial Love and Harmony subsisted sometime between them those only can judge of whose Hearts have felt the inexpressible Delights of a sincere and mutual UnionBut alas how short is all human HappinessThe Lady began to grow more cool in her Affections to her Husband than her Duty her Honour or her Interest ought to have suffer'd herHer Heart was estrang'd and foreign Inclinations contaminated her SoulWhat can be said when so much Innocence should plunge suddenly and rashly into ViceBut alas  Frailty thy Name is Woman  This domestic Unhappiness of the Actor brought on others Negligent of every Thing his Affairs grew worse and he was at last compell'd to banish himself to another Kingdom till Measures were taken to make his Creditors easy During his Absence this bad Woman  carried on a Correspondence of the most criminal Nature and spread every false Report to injure him in the tenderest Point his Honour that witty Malice could invent or the damnedst Fiend perpetrate it was reported her  Husband  was not only  privy  to but the  willing procuring pandering Promoter  of her Crimes and  his own  InfamyGood GodWhat will not Iniquity suggest and Uncharitableness believeAlthough  Vide  Motto to Letters from a Husband to a Wife  c  publish'd by Mr  T C  It is a Kind of Slander to trust Rumour  Yet this vile Notion too far prevail'd as you will immediately seeThe Season of acting was now pretty far advanc'd and this Actor as returned to his Employment was to do his Duty and get his Livelyhood at the Theatre The Night came on he was to appear and tho' it had been bruited about the Town that because he was a  willing Cuckold  there was a very  virtuous Party  form'd to drive him off the Stage and not suffer him to appear again he paid little Regard to this Rumour conscious of his Innocence But the poor Devil found himself mistaken The House was very early crowded and the harmonious discordant Concert of  Catcals Whistle c c  began to play before the Curtain drew upWellthough the Actors were all frighten'd the Play began with Calmness and Applause but this was only a Prelude to the Battle When the Scene came in which he was to appear there was a dead Silence till he popp'd his poor Head from behind the Scenes then at once the HurleyBurley began Volleys of Apples and Potatoes and such vile Trash flew about his Ears He retir'd the Storm subsided he advanc'd it began againIn the most humble Gesture and Address he made a Motion to be heard it was all in Vain and he was once more pelted offBut what can describe in those dreadful Moments the Anguish of his Heart Who can conceive the various Agitations of his SoulGrief Rage Resentment Horror Despair mix'd with Resolution were all at once fermenting in his BosomBut determin'd to go through the Play he went through it amidst the greatest Uproar that ever was heard so long a Space in a Theatre and by a  confident Heart he surmounted what many of less Resolution would have sunk under  For some time after every Joke in a Part he himself spoke or if when he was on the Stage any Thing was said that alluded to Cuckoldom the Joke was made allusive to him and the Audience had their Laugh This could be born and he knew it would die away of itself But on a Trial in Relation to his Wife's Infamy something gave Offence to a noble  C M  retn  Colonel  in the Army who to revenge a suppos'd Affront raised a  Posse  against the  Actor  and from the Boxes began a new Attack and were determin'd he should appear no more on the Stage till he had given the Gentleman Satisfaction by making a publick Recantation All Attempts were made to get over this some of the  Royal Family  came but their Presence was not thought of Sanction enough to curb the Insolence of  some People  and an  obscure Thing  of an  Actor  performing his Part He was at last forc'd out of prudential Reasons not from any Conviction of his Error to give the Colonel the Satisfaction of a publick Recantation and so that Affair drop'd  I could enumerate several other Instances of  my own  where my private Conduct and Character have laid me under a publick Censure but as the two Instances I have quoted are the most material and fresh in every one's Memory they may be thought sufficient to prove that the Publick or rather some of the Publick will assume a Liberty over a Player's private Life and Actions  But now  Reader  let your Memory return some Page or two back and to carry on a Connection remember the Reason why  Wilks  gain'd a Superiority over  Powell  C Cibber  's Apology p  "There are other Instances says the apologetical Historian of the Reward and Favour which in a Theatre Diligence and S  briety seldom fail  Mills  the elder grew into the Friendship of  Wilks  with not a great deal more than their useful Qualities to recommend him With this Assiduity and this Friendship he was advanc'd to a larger Salary than any ManActor  during my Time on the Stage The Contempt and Distresses of  Powel  struck  Booth  with such a Terror of his Example that though he had been a frank Lover of his Bottle he immediately reform'd for which both in his Fame and Fortune he enjoy'd the Reward and Benefit"  I must here add a living Instance of what Care and indefatigable Industry will do The younger  Mills  not to take from him the Merit he has is not equal to the late Mr  Mills  When he was a young Actor he followed his Father's Steps and being endow'd with a prodigious Memory would get Parts of very great Length which then he had not a distant View of ever performing This Talent and his Application to his Business made him in a Course of Time become  useful  which in a Theatre is the best Recommendation On his succeeding to many of Mr  Wilks  's Parts the Town look'd on him in a very indifferent Light but his being always thoroughly perfect and improving by Encouragement and Application many Prejudices insensibly wore away and now he is seen in Mr  Wilks  's Parts not without Approbation  I must here speak of  myself  When I first came on the Stage the Town had very little Hopes of me nor did I fling out the  Proffer  of any  great Genius  yet I was industrious and observant of my Business on the Stage and did all in my Power to become any Way  useful  I remember that for Want of a better Performer I undertook to be the  Harlequin  and as few knew who it really was I was received with more Applause than I could have imagin'd sufficient enough if I had not had an inborn Contempt for such  Mummery  to have rais'd my Vanity Nor was this my only Success in  Pantomime  every one who remembers  Doctor Faustus  at  DruryLane  must remember the  Statue  All the Pantomimical Motions of this magic Statue had a good Effect in that Scene they surpriz'd they elevated they pleas'd and were applauded I had the Honour to animate that  Statue  yet as the Applause I receiv'd was false I receiv'd it not as a Tribute to the Merit of an Actor but the Tricks of a  Scaramouch  or  Sadler  's  Wells Tumbler  As I had set my  Father and other first Rate Actors for my  Exemplar  before my Eyes I had Ambition enough to attempt their Parts and say to Posterity  Exegi monumentum aere perennius  I have from this Principle all along push'd forward for the Goal of  theatric Fame  and throughout my Character as an Actor have kept to the  sibi constet  for what other Failures and Follies soever I might be guilty  propria persona  yet in my  persona personata  on the Stage I have done every Endeavour to please nor can my Enemies say that I ever came before an Audience imperfect or inebriated If I have sometimes mistook my Talents and appear'd in Characters to which I was unequal I hope and believe the Candour of the Town will excuse that  Ambition  if in some others I give them any Pleasure  To digress from this  Apology  to my theatric  chronological History  to understand which after so many intervening Paragraphs see the succinct Account From to the  King  and  Duke  's Companies had various Fortunes till they united After that the Actors Characters in are given a Revolution happen'd again in and after various Changes of  theatric Ministers Stage Cabals Patentee Oppressions  too numerous to be extracted from Mr  C Cibber  's History as they consist chiefly of  ChitChat  and  l'Amusements  and

Approbation of our Society Diligence and Neglect were under an equal Eye the one never fail'd of its Reward and the other by being rarely excused was less frequently committed"  Yet sure there must be some Partiality in these Menagers and some Jealousy of young Actors for several whom they slighted became at the other Stage good Actors and were in high Esteem with a great Part of the Town and several in their own House have since been thought excellent who in their Menagement seldom or ever appear'd But Appearance as well as Applause is the  warm Weather  of a  Theatrical Plant  This Observation and several others will show that I write as an Historian ought without Favour or Affection  One Reformation which the  Apologist  and his  CoRulers  introduced deserves Attention as the present Stages stand in need of such another  "  Ditto  Among other necessary Reformations says he what not a little preserv'd to us the Regard of our Auditors was the Decency of our clear Stage from whence we had many Years shut out those idle Gentlemen  who seem'd more delighted to be pretty Objects themselves than capable of any Pleasure from the Play Who took their daily Stands where they might best Elbow the Actor and come in for their Share of the Auditor's Attention In many a labour'd Scene of the warmest Humour and of the most affecting Passion have I seen the best Actors disconcerted while these buzzing Muscatoes have been fluttering round their Eyes and Ears How was it possible an Actor so embarrass'd should keep his Impatience from entering into that different Temper which his personated Character might require him to be Master of"  This Nusance of having Crouds behind our Scenes is now as intolerable as ever both to the judicious Spectator and careful Player and nothing but the  Auri Sacra Fames  of the  Managers  would induce them to indulge such an Abuse of the Stage They may say indeed it has been so long a Custom that young Gentlemen of Distinction will not be denied nor is it their Interest to deny themPray good Master Manager let me ask you a QuestionWill a  dozen Crowns  compensate the Affront given to a whole Audience of a hundred or a hundred and fifty Pounds Will or can a few young Men of Quality support your Interest like the Ladies in the Boxes the Gentlemen of the Inns of Court in the Pit or the more grave Citizens in the first GalleryWell but you answer if such a Custom was now denied there would be  Uproars  in the House which of late have been of such fatal Consequence that it would be dangerous to hazard them againThat might be  Sirs  as your Conduct prov'd It has been experienc'd if you give proper Notice to the Town  None will be admit  ed behind the Scenes  and your Servants execute those Orders with the greatest Complaisance yet determined Resolution the Evil might be soon remedied as it is an Evil which no Pretence can defend and all the Town will support an Alteration of The Spectators would think themselves injured as well as you and the Town very lately supported a Manager in suppressing another Nusance the noisy Insolence and Impertinence of the  Footmen  In short were they resolved  to give up a few  pecuniary Pittances  they might in a Week keep the Scenes as clear from these Squirts and Puffs of Foplings as ever Besides as  Ars est Celare artem  it would be politick not to let them see the  Backside of our Tapestry  for many an Actor and Actress may seem but ordinary Stuff on strict Examination who from a front Prospect on the Stage may seem very well Mr  Rich  indeed when his own important Action is depending has some Regard to this Rule and the Scenes are kept clear because Persons then admitted might impede the  Scenery  and the  Beaus  and  Impertinents  are satisfied with this ReasonIs not then the Reason the same in Relation to the Actors and the Scenery of a Play as to a Pantomime  Res ipsa loquitur  This Nusance is besides a Disencouragement to an Actor's Performance for when all who appear well dress'd are admitted behind the Scenes may it not as it has sometimes happen'd give an Opportunity to a Monster dire hated by Gods and Men a  Catchpole  call'd under this Form to touch with magic Spell the ShoulderBlade of some plum'd buskin'd Heroe and  O vile Shame  compulsive force him into  Durance base  where by coercive Power he is restrain'd till Bail of Manager shall set him freeSuch Apprehensions must alarm an Actor who may not be the best Oeconomist and I am sure I have often seen Faces that have given me the Palpitation of the Heart  Mr  Cibber  complains justly of another Distress the Managers of a Theatre are under which as I have myself experienc'd when I was the deputed Manager for  Summer  Companies at  DruryLane  and a real one at the  Theatre  in the  HayMarket  I shall consider this Particular There is no greater Persecution in the Government of a Playhouse than the Persecution of  bad Authors  The Managers think their Case hard and the Authors think so of theirs Indeed it would move Pity when an ingenious Indigent has been labouring  invita Minerva  to heap up a Pile of Stuff which he calls Poetry and to depend on it for more Months Support than he has been scribbling it yet after all to find it rejected But though rejected in the mildest Manner  and for the justest Cause yet the Manager must fall under severe Censure and can have no Taste for good Writing nor knows what is Sense He must be a Blockhead convict Out comes an Epigram or a Satire and we are stigmatiz'd as Fools because we will not exhibit a Piece which we are sure we must loose by But pray if we have Pity for a Gentleman's Circumstances is our good Nature to carry us such Lengths as will injure ourselves No  Charity begins at home  and I see no Reason why a theatrical Trader should not have the same Privilege as his Majesty's other Liege Subjects in Trade to buy or refuse what he pleases The Managers ought to be allowed this Liberty of judging Plays  c  before they are brought on the Stage for when they are brought on the Audience will claim the Freedom of judging of them as they think proper They damn many which are brought on but they would have nothing else to do the Year throughout were the Managers of a Theatre to exhibit all the theatrical Lumber which is brought to them To give a Refusal to these Sparks is difficult and practised differently by different Persons Mr  Wilks  would show the utmost Complaisance on these Occasions and by paying the Author Compliments on his Piece that there were many  pretty Things  in it but it would not do as it stood then or that it might be alter'd for the better By this I say he sooth'd the Poet's Anger who though he went not away satisfy'd did not go away enrag'd Mr  C Cibber  was more short He return'd a Piece with  It is not fit for our Stage  Sir  it is not Theatrical  Mr  Rich  is more laconic still for he only says or writes  It will not do  Mr  Fletewood  took a different Way from them all he being a Gentleman of Rank by Birth piqu'd himself on treating Authors as Gentlemen He would see them excuse his not having had Time to peruse their Pieces treat them with great Deference and desire them to call againThough this was a wrong Method and gave him much unnecessa  y Trouble yet Courtierlike he was pleased w  th a great Number of Dependants to all of whom he gave as much Favour as he could and when he had  kept them in Suspence sometimes too long he dismiss'd them with much Complaisance and good NatureAs for myself on such Occasions I followed my Father's Track if I read a Piece and found it was not  Theatrical  I returned it to the Author and told him so  roundly  Perhaps the Spark with a  mifty Air  walk'd off and wrote against me But what car'd I  Demens Judicio Vulgi Sanus Meo  But the most pleasant Way of returning an Author a refus'd Play was that of  Quin  's This Anecdote is worth relating When Mr  James Quin  was a managing  under Mr  Rich  at  LincolnsInnFields  he had a  Heap of Plays brought him which he put in a Drawer in his Beauroe An Author had given him a Play behind the Scenes which I suppose he might lose or mislay not troubling his Head about it Two or three Days after Mr  Bayes  waited on him to know how he lik'd his Play  Quin  told him some Excuse for its not being receiv'd and the Author desir'd to have it  return'd  "There says  Quin  there it lies on that Table"The Author took up a Play that was lying on a Table▪ but on op  ning found it was a  Comedy  and  his  was a  Trag  dy  and told  Quin  the Mistake  "Faith then Sir said he I have lost your Play"  Lost my Play  cries the Bard  "Yes by Gd I have answer'd the Tragedian but here is a Drawer full of both  Comedies  and  Tragedies  take any  two  you will in the Room of it"  The Poet left him in  high Dudgeon  and the Heroe stalk'd across the Room to his  Spaw Water  and  Rhenish  with a negligent Felicity  But to drop the Cutrain of this Chapter which shall close with Mr  Cibber  's last Speech  "  C Cibber  's Apology p  During our last four Years there happen'd so very little like what has been said before that I shall conclude with barely mentioning those unavoidable Accidents that drew on our Dissolution The first that for some Years had led me the Way to  greater was the continued ill State of Health which render'd  Booth  incapable of appearing on the Stage The next was the Death of Mrs  Oldfield  which happen'd on the d of  October  About the same Time Mrs  Porter  then in her highest Reputation for Tragedy was lost to us by the Misfortune of a dislocated Limb from the overturning of a Chaise and our last Stroke was the Death of  Wilks  in  September  the Year following  Notwithstanding such irreparable Losses whether when these favourite Actors were no more to be had their Successors might not be better born with than they could possibly have been while the other were in Being or that the Generality of Spectators from their Want of Taste were easier to be pleased than the Few that knew better or that at worst our Actors were still preferable to any other Company of the several then subsisting or to whatever Cause it might be imputed our Audiences were far less abated than our Apprehensions had suggested so that tho' it began to grow late in Life with me having still Health and Strength enough to have been as useful on the Stage as ever I was under no visible Necessity of quitting it But so it happen'd that our surviving Fraternity having got some chimaerical and as I thought unjust Notions into their Heads which though I knew they were without much Difficulty to be surmounted I chose not at my Time of Day to enter into new Contentions and as I found an Inclination in some of them to purchase the whole Power of the Patent into their own Hands I did my best while I stay'd with them to make it worth their while to come up to  my Price  and then  patiently  sold out my Share to the first Bidder wishing the Crew I had left in the Vessel a good Voyage  What Commotions the Stage sell into the Year following or from what Provocations the greatest Part of the Actors revolted and set up for themselves in the  Little Theatre  in the  HayMarket  lies not within the Province of my Title Page to relate Or as it might set some Persons living in a Light they  might possibly not chuse to be seen in I will be rather thankful for the involuntary Favour they have done me than trouble the Publick with private Complaints of fancied or real Injuries"  Thus ends Mr  Colley Cibber  's History of his  own Times  and from this  Aera  I shall as a Supplement to his  Apology  continue  mine  The View of the Stage for Nine Years past in which I have had a large Share of Action may seem a proper  Appendix  to his more copious and laborious History  But before I conclude this Chapter I must do Justice to another compendiary Historian old  Downes  the Prompter who has given the Characters of the Actors in the Year of the  Union  There is a Particuliarity in his Stile and Manner and a turgid Pompousness in his Epithets yet it is not to be wondered at having been so many Years conversant with  theatric Phrases  and  elevated Elocution  His Stile nor Manner are not copious and digressive as that of Mr  Colley Cibber  yet there is a  Something  in it by which the judicious Reader will discern some Affinity of  Genius  Take his Characters in their own Order and Orthography  Mr  Wilks  proper and comely in Person of graceful Port Mein and Air void of Affectation his Elevations and Cadences just congruent to Elocution especially in genteel Comedy not inferior in Tragedy the Emission of his Words free easy and natural attracting attentive Silence in his Audience I mean the Judicious except were there are unnatural Parts as  I'll mount the Sky  And kick the Gods like Footbals as I fly  As Poet  Durfey  has it  Which puts the Voice to such obstraperous Stretch  Requires

justly the Humour of a starch'd Bea  or Fop to the Lord  Foppington  Sir  Fopling  and Sir  Courtly  equaling in the last the late eminent Mr  Mounford  not much inferior in  Tragedy  had Nature given

in which I was a principal Actor what a Kind of a Part I play or how well I perform'd it I must submit as I ever shall all my other theatrical Actions to the Censure or Approbation of the Publick  CHAP VII  The Author's Ambition in the remarkable Year  His commencing Author The Reasons for it The  Author  and  Alexander  compared Mr  Colley Cibber  privately takes away  King John  from  DruryLane  TheatreThe Author's Speech as a  theatrical Patriot  The  DruryLane  Company r  volt from  Highmore  and go to the  Haymarket  The A  t of Parl  ment for  licensing  the  Stage  considered by the  Author  a  Mr  Colley Cibber  Reflecti  ns on the Author  Pasquin  A theatrical State Secret  _THE Theatre has with Humour and Propriety been compared to a Political State but the Nature of its Government has never been fixed Some affirm the natural Constitution of a Theatre is a Republick some say it is a limited others an unlimited Monarchy What is the best or what the original Form of Government was or what future Kind of Government it may have the most shrewd theatric Politician cannot affirm Whatever my Notions may be as to national Government yet as to a Theatrical State I must ingenuously confess myself Antimonarchical I am for a Government by a few a Triumvirate▪ and I will tell you roundly Reader my Reason The Stage never succeded better than under the Triumvirate and as I can never be a sole Monarch this is the best Form I can think of which would give me Power equal to a Monarch though not the titular Honour for my Copartners in Empire should be little more than Cyphers  gnifying roundly  Nothing They might indeed be  Triumvirs  but then like Duke  Trincalo  in the Play I would Triumvir over them This may seem too vain a Conjecture of my own Parts and too vain a Contempt of the Understanding of others but in the Sequel of this Story you will find that as I was the Bustlemaster General I was also the CommanderGeneral and Treatymaster General if with all these Commissions I could not secure to myself as much or more Power than most Monarchs in fact have I ought to be stigmatiz'd for the errantest Dolt that ever pretended to  Machiavelism  But after this  Proaemium  let me introduce Matters of Fact for which it will be necessary to premise some few Things regarding myself before the Triumvirate was dissolv'd and Mr  Colley Cibber  sold his Share in the Patent as they will the better connect what Relations Observations Contemplations Ruminations Quotations and Argumentations which may ensue  From the little hopes which the Publick conceived of me as an Actor who would make any Figure by Industry Application and what join'd to them is  the All in All  Genius  I rose into a gradual Esteem of the Town But lest my Significance as an Actor should not be glaring enough I was resolved young as I was at a Time when the whole Nation was in a Bustle to make my Share in it In the Year when all Men thought of raising Estates and bubbling the World out of what Money they could I had a violent Ambition of getting much Money and making much Noise Would you think it but I will confess the Simplicity of my Heart I thought then that were I a  SouthSea  Director  That I wou'd doYe GodsWhat I wou'd do  But as I was resolv'd I was to act something  adventrous  within my Sphere and unlike the other Projectors I built my Scheme on a valuable Foundation and according to City Phrase I had the Credit of the best Man in  England  to make use of In short as all were commencing great Men I was resolv'd to commence Author and accordingly alter'd a Play of  Shakespear  's  and had it brought on the Stage nor was the Success of it much unequal to my Hopes This indeed was thought striking a bold Stroke to alter  Shakespear  was a Task that some Persons merely bigotted to Antiquity shudder'd at the Name they calling it sacrificing violating affronting and I don't know what the Manes of that Bard But sure all unprejudic'd Persons will not deny that some historical Plays of  Shakespear  want what we now call  Jeau de Theatre  that is a asomething necessary to make  Shakespear  be more more in brief more  Jeu de Theatre  My parental Exemplar had alter'd  Richard  the IIId before that is he had cull'd the Flowers of two or three Plays and had bunch'd them up into a Nosegay for the Devil a Line did he write himself some indeed he alter'd but some say for the worse In this Manner I alter'd  Henry the Sixth  and that the present and future Age might know that I had alter'd it I printed it with my own Name in  capital Letters  in the TitlePage This is mention'd to shew  hat I did  patrassare  in my first setting out in a Theatre but here I allow  non passibus aequis  From this Instance however the Publick saw there was some Spirit of Audacity and the Dawn of Genius in me From this notable Aera I became more singularly remarkable both on and off the Stage I had some few small Parts given me in which I succeeded beyond Expectation but as by this Time I knew so much of a Theatre that I was sensible  Original Parts  made the strongest Influence in the Audience I endeavour'd to get all the little sprightly or humourous Parts which I thought I could hit the first in which I was more particularly taken Notice of was the  Country FootBoy  in the  Conscious Lovers  The Part was but a few Lines yet I without Affectation say that I struck in to the aukwardlypert cunning of such an unlick'd Cub so naturally that I had as many Claps as Speeches I valued not the Length of a Part so much as its Humour and if I had Applause when I was on the Stage I was better satisfied than being on the Stage longer and having no Applause at all Other young Actors of the House thought in regard to me what  Wilks  and  Powel  did as to Mr  Cibber sen  Coiley Cibber  's Apology p  "They generally measured says he the Goodness of a Part by the Length of it I thought none bad by being short that were closely natural nor any the better for being long without that Quality But in this I doubt as to their Interest they judg'd better than myself for I have generally observ'd that those who do a great deal not ill have been preferr'd to those who do but little though never so masterly"  As to the latter Part of the Sentence Experience has prov'd equally that to act much tolerably and not so much masterly are the Ways to rise to the Top of a Theatre Mr  Cibber  was himself a Master of a Company and it is no very great odds but Mr  T C  may succeed to the same Post of honourable Profit  As I rose into some Degree of Approbation I succeeded Mr  Norris  commonly call'd  Dicky Norris  in several of his Parts which with several others which I was well receiv'd in put me a little upon my Mettle and I began to think as I had heard my Father say he was taken Notice of most for being an Author as well as an Actor that I would pursue the same Measures I soon came to a Resolution for Ambition in great Souls acts with incredible Rapidity  Aut Caesar aut nullus  I thought an excellent Apothegm  Nec mora nec requies  Pen Ink Paper a Collection of Plays  c  being prepar'd to Work went I When I had thought of a Plot struck out Hints for some Characters and fix'd in the Name of a Comedy I communicated at a proper Opportunity my Design to my Father He heard me with an indolent Air and gave me no Answer but lolling back in his great Chair took a  Pinch of Snuff  and fell asleepIt is impossible to conceive the tumultuous Passions that then agitated my whole human Frame  Quick beat my Heart my Pulse ran high  And Vengeance darted from my Eye  Upon my Brow sat lowring Care  And all the Horror of Despair  Yet I waited till he awoke and repeated to him my Design of writing a Comedy  "A Comedy Boy Thou write a Comedy"  Yes Sir says I why not You wrote a Comedy before you was my Age  "True Child but my Dear I hope you don't think of this Affair seriously"  Yes Sir I have thought on it and have begun it and half wrote it  "Well but harkye Sir What has put you on this Exploit Fame Fame I suppose and  Parnassian  Glory Pr'ythe stick to thy Business as an Actor and don't shew yourself in a double Capacity a moxcomb"    Saying this he took a Pinch of Snuff and walk'd offReader you may believe I was not in a little Confusion and you may equally credit me when I tell you I thought my  Father  as errant a conceited pragmatical selfsufficient  Coxcomb  as ever he represented However on I went with my Play and when I had finish'd three Acts I accidentally happen'd to be with him alone when he surpriz'd me by saying  "Well Boy What is become of this Comedy of thine Hast thou wrote a favourite Scene yet"  I told him what Progress I had made when taking a Pinch and smiling  "Pr'ythe  says he  what dest thou mean What a Gad's Name  THE'  inspires you in this Attempt"  That Principle Sir said I that most of the World act upon  Interest  You know Sir I have not been the most frugal Oeconomist my Finances low my Debts high and my Creditors impatient a Comedy Sir from me would set all right I am sure it will do my writing it would make it run The Name would raise a  Curiosity  "Yes Sir  answer'd he  thy Name for my Namesake would secure your being damn'd However as this is the State of the Case let me see your Play when you have finish'd it and I will let you know more of my Mind I like the Reason you give for writing and therefore shall not oppose it"  Now my Heart bounded with Joy and what will not the Gratification of our Desires work upon our Heart I began to  love  my Father I look'd on him in another Light and instead of thinking him a  Coxcomb  thought he talk'd like a very sensible Man In a Fortnight my Play was finish'd and I  brought it him and read it He told me it was a rough Pebble yet might do with a little polishing for it was a tolerable good first Play In brief it pleas'd him so much that he lick'd the rude  Poetic Cub  into that Form in which it afterwards appear'd On his Consent it should be brought on the Stage immediately I could not help ruminating on the Happiness of my Case as an Author for there was not one Author then living could have brought a Performance on the Stage without infinite Trouble Vexation Charge and Interest I took Care it should get into Rehearsal at the Time the Managers had appointed who were so civil as to compliment me with the prime Part of the Season  It may smell pragmatical in the Nostrils of Gravity  yet I cannot here help remarking what Ideas the Thirst of  Fame  and  Interest  will raise in a generous Mind The Reader will think  Alexander  the  Great  and I can have no Analogy on this Occasion But though my Character is not  parallel  to him my Soul may The Minds of two Men though they are plac'd at some Distance if they think in a right Way will and must meet in one and the same Thought so every one knows two parallel Lines the least inclining to one another in the Progression must and will meet in one and the same Point as then an Analogy between  Me  and  Alexander  may be mathematically prov'd I'll show it also by Example The  Maccdonian  when he had meditated in Youth high Exploits and noble Feats of Arms his Breast all swelling with the Heaves and Throws of Ambition he set before his Eyes the Acts of  Achilles  inspired by these he shook his brandish'd Falchion on Conquest he resolv'd resolv'd and conquer'd so I ruminating on dramatic Fame  Parnassian  Glory and three third crowded Nights set before my Eyes the Writings of  Colley Cibber  inspir'd by those I brandish'd high my Pen hurling Defiance in vile Critick's Teeth On Triumph I resolv'd resolv'd and triumph'd Now some smart theatrical  Wou'dbe  will say this Comparison proves me no more like  Alexander  the  Great  than that of  Fluellin  's i  Henry the Fifth  does him like  Alexander  the  Pig  This would give me no Pain  Odi profanum vulgus arceo  But as to my Play When it began to  mellow  in Rehearsal and was almost ripe enough for the Stage a pestilential Blast of Envy had like to have destroy'd it and with it all my fair Hopes A Rumour had gone abroad that truly this Comedy was none of mine but my Father's and that he not willing to stand the Bears any more brought it out under my Name As ridiculous as this was it gain'd Belief among many therefore it was thought necessary that I should make a previous Apology to the Town to set Matters in a true Light and to take off Prejudice Accordingly I wrote a  Letter  to the  Town  and printed it in one or more of the publick Papers in which I told them that upon my Word and Credit it was all  my own Doings  and that my Father never wrote a Line of it or saw it Notwithstanding this Letter and the intrinsic Value of the Comedy there was great Opposition made to the Play and damn'd it had surely been if the Epilogue spoke by my first Wife  Jenny Cibber  and me had not sav'd it for my Father knowing how it would be wrote an  Epilogue  as a  Dialogue  between me and  Jenny  in which she told me I was a  Bloc  head to write  and that I was my  Father  's  own Son  all which were strong Jokes with the Audience I put on a pitiful Face told her I wrote to pay my Debts and that I would for the future prove a good and loving Husband if she would save my Play The Audience being won by her Entreaty to  "Give us at least an honest Chance to live  The Play liv'd nine NightsThis being the chief Incident of my Life as an  Author  I have been somewhat prolix in the Account of it and have yet some more Observations to make I mention'd that I wrote a Letter to the Town previous to the Performance of my Play Now there is a Parallel to this in the Conduct of Mr  Colley Cibber  which is not mention'd in his Apology his  Apology  not reaching to that Time Every one must remember that three Years ago Mr  Colley Cibber  brought to  DruryLane Theatre  his Play alter'd from  Shakespear  call'd  King John  It was no sooner in Rehearsal but slap the Criticks were at him directly Letters Epigrams Odes Jokes and all the Ribraldry of  Grubstreet  flew about in the Papers and it was said the Templars and their  Posse Legislatus  were engag'd to damn it On this Mr  Cibber  wrote a Letter directed  To the Students of the Inns of Court  and very handsomly and mighty civilly desired them to do no such Thing This Letter was new Fuel to the Flame they fell soul of the Letter immediately from whence he might easily conjecture how they would use his Play But what could he do the Play was just ready to be perform'd the Actors perfect Scenes painted and much Time had been spent which the Master of the House would otherwise have been using to his Interest therefore he could not fairly withdraw it However he was resolv'd it should not be damn'd and fearing the Master might insist on its being play'd what does he but at a Rehearsal seeing his Play lying on the Prompter's Table he takes up the Copy and puts it up into his Pocket  snug  and decently walk'd off with it resolving he would not run the Risque of so precarious a Fortune  I shall here while I think of it speak of a Theatrical Conduct lately practised nor can I speak of it in any Place more proper than in this I mean that of Persons belonging to a Theatre addressing the Town by Letters  I must confess that I and my Father first practised this Art with the same Success It laid us open to the Criticism of Coffeehouse Wits who thought soberly on what we wrote hastily There was such canvassing the Stile this was not  Grammar  and that was not  Sense  one Thing was  false English  another a  Cibberism  But besides the Jokes which if nothing else are nothing at a  l they debated the Point over and form'd themselves into Parties which we experienc'd were not to our Advantage I have indeed since the Time of my Play address'd the Town and with the same Success for I find by our Theatric Squabbles and Altercations we make as much Amusement to the Town in a Morning as by our Performance in an Evening The Contentions  for the Part of  Polly  between Mr  Clive  and my lateI was going to say  Wife  but a late  Woman  who was call'd by my Name That Contest I remark furnish'd a copious Topic for Conversation Argument and Publication and ended with Noise and Uproars in the Playhouse There has been the same Thing practised by  Monsieur Denoyer  and  Madamoiselle Roland  and before by  Monsieur Poitier  and  Madamoiselle Roland versus  Messieurs  Quin  and  Fleetwood  and yet another which made not a little Noise between the two  Harlequins  Messieurs  Philips  and  Woodward  The Consequence of all these Addresses has been this the Town is call'd into the Playhouse as the  dernier Resort  to judge of Things which the  Master  of the House is only Judge of When the Judges come to this mixt Court of Judicature where all present may pass Sentence they are divided in Opinion and then the Question must be decided by Noise and Tumult and they who are the greatest Rioters carry it I do not find that any of these epistolary Addresses to the Town from theatric Performers have done them any Service nor would I advise on any Occasion to have Recourse to such Expedients However there is no Rule without Exception Mr  Rich  who has never suffered his People to make Appeals nor ever made them himself was at last drawn in by meer Necessity A little trifling pragmatical obscure  'Pothecary  that lives in some bye Street or Alley about  CoventGarden  one  JHll  publishes a  Thing  call'd the  Opera  of  Orpheus  and in a scurrilous Preface to it abuses Mr  Rich  for having stole his Entertainment of  Orpheus  and  Eurydice  from  his Orpheus  and instigated the Publick to do Justice for so notorious a Fraud nor was this Pamphlet his only Attack He run about the Town made Parties and People from his Representations thought him really injured Now it became necessary for Mr  Rich  likewise to appeal to the Town and to set the Affair in a true Light and plainly narrate downright Matters of Fact To this  Hll  replied with all the scoundrel Scurrility his little Wit could afford and I also became an Object of his Malice There was a candid Answer printed to his Pamphlet the Night before  the Entertainment came out This Address to the Publick from Mr  Rich  was necessary and had the desired Effects The first Night the  Entertainment  was  crouded  and was received with general Applause and the World has never since hear'd of that  JHll  who sunk into that Obscurity from whence he emerg'd  But to return Reader to that Station in the Theatre from whence I digress'd After having wrote my Play call'd the  Lover  I began to think myself every Day of more and more Consequence and having got an Insight into the Manner of Managing I began to think I  s Equal to the Management of a young Company to play in the Summer Season Accordingly I got Leave from Mr  Wilks  and the other Masters to form a young Company and to play during the Vacation This was no bad Thing for the Masters nor the inferior Players for the first receiv'd a settled Payment for the Use of a few old Scenes and Cloaths and the latter generally five or six Days pay  per  Week for two Days Performance Besides I generally brought out some new Pieces and Farces which not only turned to our immediate Account but to the Good of the  Actors  as  Actors  and to the  Masters  by becoming very gainful Performances the Winter or two following To Instance this I need say no more than that  George Barnwell  the  Devil to pay  the  M  ck Doctor  and the  Beggars Opera  the Part of  Polly  by Mrs  Clive  were first perform'd under my Management of Summer Companies From these young Companies see what Performers have been chiefly sprung Mrs  Clive  Mrs  Buttler  and though last not least in LoveMYSELF This Custom I continued till the Revolution of the whole Company under my Conduct of which more hereafter This Management of mine was an undoubted Proof of my Abilities and I did imagine I might become a Manager in my own Right But alas how frail are all human Hopes On the Death of Mr  Wilks  Mr  Cibber sen  sold out at a proper Opportunity his Share of the Patent to Mr  Highmore  a Gentleman who had a great liking to theatrical Affairs and who had play'd some Parts on the Stage meerly I suppose to shew what a Judge he was of acting and  consequently of Actors The Parts he play'd were  H  tspur  and  L  thario  This Gentleman besides his Liking to theatrical Affairs had chiefly a Liking to theatrical Gain He had heard and partly seen what Profits the Managers had made for a long Course of Years and had a Mind to purchase what he thought would prove so fine an Income How his Expectations were answered you will find related Here I must disclose a Secret When Mr  Cibber sen  sold out his Share in the Patent I was desperataly alarm'd and look'd on it as a Piece of Injustice done to myself For I thought his Share or at least the major Part of his Share would have devolved upon me as an Inheritance therefore I looked on myself as a  disinberited Son  and that  Highmore  had bought clandessinely my  BirthRight  or rather by sinister Means  deprived  me of it This may serve for a Reason why I so heartily enter'd into the Measures I afterwards prosecuted On Mr  Booth  's Death the Patent became invested to the Property of Mr  Highmore  the Widow  Booth  and the Widow  Wilks  The whole Company began to murmur at being rul'd by so motley a Kind of Government as they were now falling under  viz  A Man who knew nothing of the Business and two Women unfit for such a Province Mr  Ellis  was indeed deputed to act for Mrs  Wilks  b  t I believe that did not much better the Affairs Mr  Ellis  however became not only a Deputy to Mrs  Wilks  but PrimeMinister and  FacTotum  to  Highmore  This could be no pleasant Situation for the other Actors who had been so many Years labouring in the Theatre and bo  e the Burthen of the Day such as the elder  Mills  Mr  Johnson Miller Griffin  and some others who though younger had some Claim as  Mills jun  and  self  I found this an admirable Time to put in Execution a Design I had plan'd which was at a proper Opportunity to fling off the Yoke and set up for Masters and Managers ourselves At one of our private Meetings all were complaining yet no one proposed a Method of Redress when I got up from my Chair and thus delivered myself  Gentlemen  MY Heart never beats with a stronger Joy than when I have a Power of  thinking  and  acting  right I think the Glow that now warms my Bosom is raised by  Truth  and cherished by  Sobriety  Long have you complained of the Tyranny you groan under and long have looked with Indignation on your Chains But what  O ye Gods  can avail lugubrious Lamentations Of what Force is such female Rhetorick If you think you receive Injuries deliver yourselves from them If you would not be  Slaves  be  free  If you have a  Will  to be so you have  Power  Under what Bonds are you consined By what Allegiance are you restrained You have a glorious Cause You may be the Asserters of the Cause of  Liberty  What though your Enemies have got the  Patent  you have your  own Talents  your  own Endowments  of  Nature  and  Acquisitions  of  Art  What is the  Great Seal  to you You may say of  that  as was said by a great and bold Man of  Magna Charta  it was a  Magna Farta  If you have Spirits Resolution and Conduct a fair Road invites to Wealth Fame and Freedom You may take their House of some of the Renters and get Possession of it by Artifice and set up yourselves A Stratagem in War is no Crime Or failing in that you may  pro tempore  take the little  Haymarket House  Your Company will be better than theirs and Novelty of Places will be changing the Scene and give Success Perhaps it may be objected we have no  Exchequer  no  Scenes  no  Cloaths  with a long  Et caetera  What then You may have Credit enough Though some among you have not much Credit in a  private Capacity  yet in a  publick Capacity  as a Body corporate as it were much Credit will be given There are monied Men who will adventure Sums on such a Proceeding Therefore  Sirs  no longer shew this  Inanity  of  Complaint  the Means of Freedom are in your own Possession which if you refuse may you be  perpetual Slaves and be sold like a Herd of Sheep from one Purchaser to another If you dare be otherwise by this  honest Heart  I will risque my Life and Fortune with you and prove to you that I cannot only  Fari quae sentio  sed  Agere quae Sentio speak  what I  think  but  act  accordingly  This Harangue had all the Success that I could wish They resolved no longer to bear the galling Yoke of Tyranny but assert that Liberty and Property which all true  Britons  are so tenacious of When the Season was quite over we thought it a proper Time having gain'd some of the Renters to our Side to endeavour to gain Possession of the Theatre but in this we fail'd though we attacked it  Vi Armis  On this Disappointment we all agreed that the only Place we could pitch our Tents at and open our theatrical Campaign must be at the little House in the  Haymarket  Several Objections were made to the Situation of the Place and the Smallness of the Theatre but as I had the Revolution strongly at Heart I talked them and persuaded them out of all their Objections At Length it was resolved in a full Council of War that we would encamp at the  Haymarket  we accordingly took the House of one  Potter  a Carpenter who was the Landlord b  spoke all our dramatick Equipages and Furniture and held frequent Councils to settle the Operations of the ensuing Campaign At the Fair of  Bartholomew  we gain'd some Recruits but besides those Advantages over the Enemy I myself went there in Person and publickly  exposed  myself This was done to fling Defiance in the Patentees Teeth for on the Booth where I exhibited I hung out the  StageMutiny  with  Pistol  at the Head of his Troop our Standard bearing this Motto  We Eat  In a few Days after the Patentees opened with  Aesop  to which they added an occasional Scene written formerly by Sir  John Vanbrugh  on a prior De  ertion of Actors wherein they thought they did great Service to the Patentees and cast a severe Ro  ction on us They next attack'd us by another old wornout rh  psodical Affair of one  Feildings  call'd  the  Author  's Farce in which I and my Father were daily ridicul'd But all this I laugh'd at in my Sleeve well considering that joking on the  Cibbers  could not hurt us On the contrary we open'd with  Love for Love  and got up all the strongest Plays with a diligent Expedition Our Company consisted of the old  Veterans  who were allow'd by the Town to be greatly superior to our Antagonists for excepting Mrs  Clive  and Mrs  Horton  there was not one in their Company but was the contemptible Refuse of the Theatre We had also receiv'd an additional Force by receiving Mr  Milward  who having left Mr  Rich  on some Disgust join'd our Forces The Patentees imagin'd that much depended on the Number of their Troops and they had try'd considerable Reinforcements from strolling Companies but being all awkward and undisciplin'd they were no more to compare to us than the County Militia to the King's BodyGuards  Vide C Cibber  's Apology p    "What rude riotous Havock was made of all the late dramatic Honours of our Theatre All became at once the Spoil of Ignorance and SelfConceit  Shakespear  was tortur'd and defac'd in every single Character  Hamlet  and  Othello  lost in one Hour all their good Sense their Dignity and Fame  Brutus  and  Cassius  became noisy Blusterers with bold unmeaning Eyes mistaken Sentiments and turgid Elocution Not young Lawyers in hir'd Robes and Plumes at a Masquerade could be less what they could seem or more aukwardly personate the Character they belong'd to"  This exclamatory Invective of Mr  Colley Cibber  on the Revolution which  Betterton  made is so  apropos  to my Revolution I could not forbear quoting it As we met with much Success and the Patentees with none at all they thought to effect by Policy what they could not obtain by Force They endeavour'd therefore to silence us not by the Authority of the Lord Chamberlain but that of an Act of Parliament by which they would prove us Vagabonds To effect this▪ Mr  Harper  was taken up as a Vagabond and was committed  to  Bridewell  But on the Trial of the Legality of his Commitment it appear'd that he was not within the Description of the Act of the Twelfth of Queen  Ann  against Vagabonds he being a Housekeeper and having a Vote for the Members of Parliament for  Westminster  He was therefore discharg'd and conducted through the Hall amidst the triumphant Acclamations of his theatric Friends Having carried this important Point we had nothing to fear from the Patentees knowing now that our Success depended solely on our own good Conduct and the Favour of the Publick I cannot but confess that we had dismal Apprehensions of the Force of the Act which would have so fix'd the Power of the Patent that we must  invitis animis  have return'd to the Dominions of our former Masters We had indeed got a specious Colour of a Licence and put at the Top of our Bill  By Licence of the Master of the Revels  for which titular Honour we paid him handsomely yet we did this rather to induce the Publick to think we play'd by a legal Authority and under the Sanction of the Court than for any Right which we thought it conferr'd on us We could not be ignorant that Mr  Giffard  's Company at  Goodman  's  Fields  was then playing against all the Opposition that could be made to it against the Power of the City of  London  and even their Remonstrances to the Court that it was a Nusance In short it was not then thought in the Power of the Crown to suppress a Playhouse though acting without Royal Licence and Permission because it was not evidently an illegal Thing But the Case is now alter'd by a late Act of Parliament which has fix'd all Power in regard to Theatres and theatrical Affairs in the Lord Chamberlain for the Time being As this Act is of such Importance to the Theatres and the passing it caus'd great Debates in both Houses it may be proper to consider the Cause and Reasons given for having it enacted in relating which I may give some curious Anecdotes and StateSecrets which Mr  C Cibber  has omitted yet I shall open my Narrative in his Words as they are an Invective against a certain Person for whom also I have a Word or two in  Petto  "  Vide C Cibber  's Apology p  These tolerated Companies gave Encouragement to a broken Wit to collect a fourth Company who for sometime acted Plays in the  Hay Market  which House the united  DruryLane  Comedians had quited This enterprising Person I say whom I do not chuse to name unless it could be to his Advantage or that it was of Importance had Sense enough to know that the best of Plays with bad Actors would turn but to a very poor Account and therefore found it pecessary to give the Publick some Pieces of an extraordinary Kind the Poetry of which he conceiv'd ought to be so strong that the greatest Dunce of an Actor could not spoil it He knew too that as he was in haste to get Money it would take up less Time to be intrepidly abusive than decently entertaining that to draw the  Mob  after him he must rake the Chanel and pelt their Superiors that to shew himself Somebody he must come up to  Juvenal  's Advice and stand the Consequence  "Aude aliquid brevibus gyaris carcere dignum  "Si vis esse aliquis  Juv  Such then was the mettlesome Modesty he set out with upon this Principle he produc'd several frank and free Farces that seem'd to knock all Distinctions of Mankind on the Head Religion Laws Government Priests Judges and Ministers were all laid flat at the Feet of this  This is to be taken in a double Sense the Person struck at having since called himself  Hercules Vinegar  and is the notorious Author of the  Champion  Herculean Satyrist  This Drawcansir in Wit that spar'd neither Friend nor Foe who to make his Fame immortal like another  Erostratus  set Fire to his Stage by writing up to an Act of Parliament to demolish it I shall not give the particular Strokes of his Ingenuity a Chance to be remember'd by reciting them it may be enough to say in general Terms they were so openly  flagrant that the Wisdom of the Legislature thought it high Time to take Notice of them"  The Person of whom Mr  Cibber  only gives the Outside Lines of his Pourtrait is at present well known by those only but that Posterity may know this iniquitous Son of Wit who has fell under this heavy Censure of the Laureat for satirizing the just Measures of the present alljust allwise and allpowerful Minister I will subscribe the Name of  Hy Fdg  Esq  Author of  Pasquin  the  historical Register Eurydice hiss'd  and others of the same political Cast To these Farces which were allegorical Satires on the Administration the Town run with the utmost Avidity of Defamation and Scandal He drew the  Mob  after him from  Grov  s  or Cavendish Hanover  and all the other fashionable Squares as also from  'Pall Mall  and the  Inns of Court  I call them as the Apologist I quoted calls them Mob for there may be your Mobs of Quality as well as Mob  of Raggimuffins your  Magnum vulgus imum  Your great Vulgar and the smallWellThese Mobs or Multitudes or Concourse or Audiences call them what you will resorted nightly to hear these Farces and were dull enough not only to think they contain'd Wit and Humour but Truth also It could not but regret me to see some noble Peers and Gentlemen I had entertain'd a very good Opinion of as to their Parts and Capacities sitting in the Sideboxes and seemingly delighted with the Performance But I have Charity enough for these Gentlemen to think they did all this more out of PartyZeal and to byass the  Mob  than from any Conviction there was in those Farces either Sense Humour or TruthBut what will not Men prostitute in a PartyCauseThe Successes of these dramatic Peices made the Mr not a little uneasy nor could the merry droll Mortal his Brother keep his Temper for let some Men be as facetions as they please and love a Laugh as much as they will they don't like the Laugh to be always on them I and my Father who can bear as much laughing at and have had as much laughing at as any two Persons in the Kingdom not excepting the two honourable Gentlemen I just now mention'd yet though we carry it off in Company it stings  it hurts our Hearts to be the standing Objects of Raillery and I will not say but if we could as well avenge the Insults on us as the M r could against him but We might perform it But to the Point From these farcical Satires a dainty Opportunity offer'd itself to the great Man not only to suppress those but to bring all Stages and all Stagewritings under such a Restriction that nothing should be exhibited for the future that should give him the least Uneasiness Here was an admirable Proof of deep Policy and Sagacity to make the Satire of his Enemies be the Tools of his Interest A Scheme was laid to accomplish his Design it was put in Execution and it succeeded  I must here enter the Verge of private History and by the following Anecdote show that I have that great Talent of an Historian not to dare to speak false and not afraid to speak Truth  Mr  Giffard  had remov'd about this Time from  Goodman's Fields  to  Lincoln'sInn Fields  House which he had hir'd of Mr  Rich  His Removal had not answer'd his End and his Affairs began to grow desperate He had never as yet given any prejudicial Offence to the Court yet was s  ppos'd not to have such Obligations to it as to deny at this Juncture the performing a Farce which might bring him a large Sum of Money At this same Time in a most vile Paper call'd  Common Sense  there was a libellous Production call'd the  Golden Rump  which the Town and the Mob were Fools enough to think Wit and Humour Now as the hitting in with the Humour of the multitudinous Mob is very advantageous to a Theatre a Dramatick Piece was wrote on the  Golden Rump  Subject and call'd the  Golden Rump  which was given Mr  Giffard  to be perform'd but before it was rehears'd it so happen'd no Matter how or why but so it happen'd that Mr  Giffard  went to  DowningStreet  with this Satirical Farce in his Pocket which was delivered to a  great Man  for his Perusal and it was found to be a scurrilous ignominious traiterous scandalous  c c c  Libel against Majesty itself It was immediately carried to shown to explain'd to and remonstrated to that if there was not an immediate Act of Parliament  to stop such Abuses not Regal Dignity was safe from them  Actum est  'Twas doneThe Point gain'd in a Moment and a proper Act order'd to be gotWell now says some impatient Reader  What of all this What Secret is this By what Inference or Inuendo does this show the M 's Policy or Finesse  Prithee don't be so mifty and let me ask you a Question by Way of a SupposeSuppose Sir this same  Golden Rump  Farce was wrote by a certain great Man's own Direction and as much Scurrility and Treason larded in it as possibleSuppose  Giffard  had a private Hint how to act in this Affair and was promis'd great Things to play a particular Part in this FarceSuppose he was promised a  separate Licence  or an EquivalentYou may then suppose the M a thorough Politician who knew to manage bad Things to the best Advantage  O but  say you  I will not found my Belief on Supposes  Truth may be supposed Suppose this Truth and you may be rightIf you are so ungenteel to require Proof demonstrative I have done with you and can only refer you to the Author and Negociators of the  Golden Rump  This however is notoriously certain that the Farce of the  Golden Rump  was carried to a great Man and the Master of the Playhouse who carried it was promised something which he has been some Time in a vain Expectation of but will now in all Probability end in nothing at all  But laying aside private Anecdotes of the obtaining the late Playhouse Act I must mention what was known to all The Masters of the two Houses acting under the Patent made no Opposition to this Bill they did all in their Power to promote it because it would suppress for the present all Theatres but their own They were so full of this Prospect that they did not perceive they were at the same Time becoming absolute Dependants on a Mr for the Bill contain'd a Clause that the Lord Chamberlain should have a Power of licensing other Theatres if he so thought proper within the City and Liberties of  Westminster  The Actors were indeed alarm'd and imagin'd this Act would lay them under Oppressions from which they  could gain no proper Redress for the constant immemorial Way of redressing Grievances in the Government of a Theatre is to raise a Revolt and bring about a Revolution But the Security of the Masters of the Playhouses and the Alarm of the Actors were both illfounded as I shall in the subsequent Narration make appear If the Lord Chamberlain can grant another Licence why then should not the Actors who may be aggriev'd by the present Masters endeavour to gain one I only ask that Question here I may explain it in another Place  Vide C Cibber  's Apology p  Mr  C Cibber  has made a copious and florid Dissertation as well political as theatrical on this Law He proves Satire on a Minister when represented on the Stage is stronger than any Satire can be that is read in the Closet therefore to license the Stage could bear no Analogy with licensing the Press He lays it down also  "that a theatrical Insult to the present Minister is equal to the Stab  Guiscard  gave the late Lord  Oxford"  Then adds  "Was it not as high Time to take this dangerous Weapon of mimical Insolence and Defamation out of the Hands of a mad Poet as to wrest the Knife from the lifted Hand of a Murderer"  In short the  Laureat  has shewn himself a profound Politician by becoming a  voluntary Champion  for that Law He says he writes on this Subject to shew the  true Pourtrait of his Mind  and  to shew how far he is or is not a Blockhead  Perhaps this was not the only Motive if he had another Design than merely to give his  shallow Reasons a little Exercise  and if it should succeed the World must admire at the Depth of his Speculations I shall illustrate this Remark when I come to descant on some Transactions of a very late Date thinking it now Time to return to that Part of my History from whence I digress'd  By the Release of  Harper  we gain'd a compleat Conquest over the Pattentees they indeed carried on the Campaign but with such Losses and Disadvantage that Mr  Highmore  the chief Sharer and Director began  to think it the most prudent Method to make the best Retreat he could Upon my Soul though as an Enemy in the Field I could not be displeas'd with his Distress yet as he paid so many thousand Pounds to my Father my honest Heart could not but feel for his being plung'd in an Affair he knew nothing of I cannot blame my Father for so advantageously selling out and was my hereditary Claim laid aside he acted prudently and consequently honestly But let that go He made me some amends by giving  Highmore  no assisting Advice how to conduct his Theatre which if he had must have greatly injured us for no one knows that Province but myself and him The new Purchaser therefore being left to himself and his Prime Minister Mr  Ells  Singers Dancers Tumblers and other exotic Performers were hir'd at extraordinary Rates This was but of very little Service and the Posture of his Affairs grew daily into a worse and worse Situation  I cannot but here observe to the Reader how different our Conduct was at the  Haymarket  I must ingenuously confess though we kept our simple Heads above Water we had got out of our Depth for after our first Run of Novelty and Interest was over our Audiences grew thin which Deficiency we supplied by Orders of our own for in the Theatres as in Shops the Appearance of Business brings Customers Nevertheless we found large Deficiencies in the Office and by the Accounts in our Books we had contracted a very considerable Debt yet we conceal'd the State of our Case as much as possible resolving to beat our Antagonists our of the Field and by such a Conquest set every Thing right If the Patentees at  DruryLane  had either known our Condition or had Prudence and Courage enough to bear with their own for another Season I know not what the Consequences might have been I may say it now I believe we should have been forc'd to a Cessation of Arms and capitulated on the best Terms we cou'd have got  Mr  Rich  had either gain'd better Intelligence of the State of our Affairs or from the State of those at  DruryLane  had found the Patentees were heartily  tir'd of their expensive instead of lucrative Offices From one of these Reasons or both he had formed a Scheme which had it been carried into Execution must have proved very gainful to the Patentees and very agreeable to the Town as it would have given them the best Plays play'd by the best Performers in  England  But as well concerted as it was for these Intentions it was destructive of the natural and legal Liberty of the Actors They would have become mere Servants to two cojoin'd Patentees nor could have had on any Disgust or Affront any Power to revolt The Scheme was for to have  DruryLane  Patent purchased of the Patentees who were tired of it at a cheap Rate and then the Patentees of  CoventGarden  and  DruryLane  to enter into a joint Partnership and engage the best Actors who should act occasionally at both Houses performing always a Comedy at one House and a Tragedy at the other There were several other Conditions which would have prov'd beneficial to the Masters which are needless to enumerate  This Plan though it has been long thought a new Finesse in theatric Policy yet  Cibber's Apology  shows it is an old StageCunning practis'd in some Measure by Mr  Rh  's Father and Mr  Owen Swinney  This Design however could not be carried into Execution by Mr  Rh  alone There was wanting the  Primum Mobile  the  Sine qua non  the Purchase Money On this Occasion he apply'd to Mr  Fltd  who was his Friend and proposed  his  purchasing the Patent and to enter into a Sort of Partnership This Proposal was set in so advantageous a Light and such fair Hopes offer'd themselves that Mr  Fltd  came into this Scheme and purchased the Patent of Mr  Highmore  and the other  Patentees  On this Turn in Affairs We at the  Haymarket  were under a most terrible Consternation we look'd on ourselves as Persons who were never to enjoy that Liberty we had so strenuously endeavour'd to obtain For this Conjunction of the Patentee Masters must have compell'd us to have returned under their Management our Affairs being in a very sad Posture and daily growing worse But very happily for us a Breach happen'd between Mr  Rh  and Mr  Fltd  at  a Time we could have least suspected it and that gave us all we wanted an Opportunity to make the best Terms with the latter get rid of our StockDebt and return to  DruryLane  I shall not enter into the Reasons for this Breach of Friendship between the two Masters as that Affair has been so differently represented but Mr  Rh  has been chiefly censured as having drawn a Gentleman into an Affair which he would not otherwise have thought to have embarked in and then leaving him to conduct his new Undertaking as he might But let their Quarrel be what it would it was advantageous to us for Mr  Fltd  being work'd into the highest Resentment was resolv'd to make up the best Company and to hurt  Rh  by getting from him his chief Actors and most necessary People Mr  Quin  was soon gained but on such Terms as no  hired Actor  had before received At the same Time Mr  Fltd  had entered into a Treaty with us at the  Haymarket  and agreed to allow all the managing Actors  two hundred Pounds  a Year each and to some a clear Benefit and to others a Benefit at a lower Rate than usual As in all the Transactions of that Affair I was  TreatyMaster General  and negociated that important Peace with the Patentee it may be expected I should enter into a long detail on that Subject My Conduct in this Respect may be somewhat singular but I can give some Reasons as an Apology for it As this will be entering on a new Scene I will halt a little as well to give my Reader a little Relief as myself for I don't know how it is but I begin to perceive myself somewhat dull and perhaps some People may have perceiv'd it a great while ago If then  Sir Reader  your Patience and good Nature are worn out fling down the Book that you may when you think proper begin the next Chapter with a better Temper and a Spirit more alert and livelyand all that  CHAP VIII  Of the Nature of writing Apologies The Author's Proof against ScandalHis Negociations and those of  Ho We  comparedHis Conduct and the Duke of  Ale  's parallel'dObligations received are no Reason for GratitudeThe Company fixed at  DruryLane  Some Remarks on it and a  Digression  _WELL  courteous Reader  you venture then to travel on maugre all the Things I can say to my own Dispraise If I like my Father tell you about every sixth Page I am a Blockhead or a Coxcomb yet you still away with my Nonsense and as my Vanity is not quite jaded you read on in Hopes to meet with some fresh Instances of it But perhaps those who may peruse this  Apology  for my  Life  may expect that I would enter into some very illustrious and renowned Acts of my private Conduct which have been very publickly talked of To such Personages I shall answer they are not to imagine a Man would set down in cool Blood and write the Devil of a Satire against  himself  That would be dainty apologizing indeed No the Thing is to say nothing harsh against your own dear Self but as many severe Things and Reflections as possible against other People Mr  Colley Cibber  whose apologetical Talents are admirable has shewn this Species of writing in  Perfection  A great many People on the Publication of his Apology cry'd  An Apology for the Life of  Colley Cibber  Well now we shall see what he can say in Regard to this and that and t'other  Things which related to  Gaming  or  Gallantry  or a thousand Things  not so very proper to be mentioned But they were all out not a Syllable of his private Character not a Word for exc  sing palliating or defending little foolish Acts which merely related to Religion or Morality I can guess what may be expected from me what Defence of particular Conduct I may make but I shall relate only such Things as may show my Parts my theatrical Character and in short what I think proper not what every impertinent Person may want to know Nor is this so unfair a Proceeding as some may imagine No Man can be obliged to accuse himself I write to put a Gloss upon my Acts and Deeds not place them in the most odious Light and erect myself in an historical Pillory It would also be an endless Work to vindicate all the simple Accusations which have been brought against me and which no Persons have any Business to trouble their Heads about Should Men say for Instance I used my first dear and wellbeloved Wife of ever blessed Memory  Jny C  with ill Usage Should they affirm that when her all pale and breathless Corps was in the Coffin laid and I with Sobs and Tears and interjected Sighs had moaned to many a Witness my too unhappy Fate yet that same Night had a Brace of  Drurian  Doxies vile in the same HouseAgain should base Defamation whisper in my Ear I sold and barter'd away my present most virtuous Spouse and that I was a voluntary Cuckold on Record Should Scandal with her hundredtongu'd curs'd Mouth rumour it up and down that neither  common Honour  nor  common Honesty  were lodg'd within the Centre of my SoulShould even all this be said calm and unruff  ed would I contemn it all and look on such Reports in the cool Light of mild Philosophy There are indeed a Set of People who will be BusyBodies To such I would answer very pithily sometimes  What is that to  ME sometimes  What is that to  YOU To illustrate what a Propriety there is in curbing such Kind of Impertinence by a  Laconic  Sentence I will tell you a short Story  A great Lawyer who now makes one of the most illustrious Figures in  WestminsterHall  was as remarkable for his Amours as his Pleadings What was  his Gallantry to any Body Yet was he often censured and made the Object of Wit for this Foible It happen'd his  Lady  his  Chambermaid  and  Cousin  all layin at the same Time A Friend of his took an Occasion to speak to him on this Subject by Way of Raillery in this Manner They say my Ld your  Lady  is brought to Bed  She is so  They say your  Cousin  and  Chambermaid  are also brought to Bed  What's that to  MEBut they say you are the Father  What's that to  YOUUpon which turning on his Heel my Ld left Mr  Impertinent  with a proper Indignation  What's that to You  is the sole Answer I shall give to any defamatory Scurrility and if any Person is not satisfied with such a Reply he may get a more satisfactory one if he knows howAfter this Observation it may be proper to resume my theatrical Story which I left off at the Treaty with Mr  Fltd  to return to  DruryLane  House and act under his Patent  As I had been the chief Person in raising our theatrical  Revolt  and being of a daring pushing Temper I was resolved to have the principal Share in the  Restoration  of the Company to  DruryLane  I accordingly got myself nominated as  Plenipo'  and began my Negociations with Mr  Fltd  How happy I was in my Negociations the Event proved and as I had to deal with a Person of Honour and Generosity I manag'd the Conduct of the whole Affair in such a Manner as to make it turn out to  myself  In short I got a good round Sum of Money out of him for why should I  negociate  and  negociate  and get nothing myself Some People may smile to see me on this Occasion compare myself to another great  Negociator  and wonder how I and  Hce We  can have any Analogy But pray do you think that he for so many Years has run from  Court  to  Court  now at the  Hague  now at  Paris  negociating here and negociating there and all for a Joke only Would any Man do this without the pleasing Recordation of  Place  and  Pension  In Truth my Friend  H  as well as myself was a little mov'd by Self Interest Besi  s our Negociations have been some what alike for mine in sact was a patch'd up Affair and I did not so much consult the Interest of my Master as  to serve a Turn for that Time I botched up a Peace but I knew it would not last many Years If there is any Preeminence in our Talents I hope I shall not seem immodest when I frankly own I think the Ballance turns in my Favour for I am now more for War than Peace  "  C Cibber  's Apology p  Thus we see as Mr  C Cibber  truly observes let the Degrees and Ranks of Men be ever so unequal Nature throws out their Passions from the same Motives 'tis not the Eminence or Lowliness of either that makes us the Difference If this familiar Stile of talking should in the Nostrils of Gravity and Wisdom smell a little too much of the Presumptuous or the Pragmatical I will at least descend lower in my Apology for it by calling to my Assistance the old humble Proverb  viz 'Tis an ill Bird that  c Why then should I debase my Prosession by setting it in valgar Lights when I may show it to more favourable Advantages Or why indeed may I not suppose that a sensible Reader will rather laugh than look grave at the Pomp of my Parallels"  When I had concluded this Treaty with Mr  Fltd  so advantageous for the Company and more particularly in a private Manner to myself we remov'd Bag and Bagage from the  HayMarket  and return'd to our old Camp at  DruryLane  Our Government was then thought to be fixed in a peaceable Manner every Thing went on with great Success and I took Care to be so much in the Master's Favour that in the Direction of the Theat  e I was a kind of Prime Minister I say a kind of Prime Minister for even then there was another Person shared amply in his Confidence and by whom he was chiefly advised When I found out this I was not a little nettled a Jealousy raised various Sentiments in my Breast for like  Pompey  the Great my Soul disdain'd the Thought of an Equal Glory and Power are the darling Passions of my Heart and not to enjoy either of them was to so jealous an Ambition a meer Shade to my Laurels My Competitor  was the Person who had been concern'd for Mrs  Wilks  and who thought himself to have an admirable Talent for theatric Affairs This Talent was to compose  Pantomimes  furbish up old Tricks and make what he call'd Entertainments As a Specimen of what Notion he had of the Dignity of the Stage I must observe that his Genius turn'd to the monstrous and the marvellous for which Reason nothing could be brought to Town to be exhibited to the Vulgar but he was for having it exhibited on the Stage There was a Fellow of an enormous Height came from  Germany  to be shewn for a Sight call'd  Mynheer Cajanus  Such a Spectacle proper enough for a  Smithfield  or  Moorfields  Booth was thought a proper Personage to grace the Theatre Royal Accordingly Negociations were begun but to my Honour be it spoke I had no Concern in them I was kept out of the Secret nor was I much affected that I was so I and his Grace the Duke of  Ale  in this Respect may be said to have the same Notion of Things His late Speech on the State of the Nation shows that he was out of the Secret in Regard to the Conduct of Affairs and as he thinks them wrong was proud that none of them could be laid to his Charge though I and that illustrious Person differ in other Sentiments in Regard to the present Ministry yet I am proud that in this Point he agrees with meBut to the History  Mynheer  soon agreed to some very advantageous Terms proposed to him was with all Secrecy convey'd into  DruryLane  Theatre and was soon shown arising from a TrapDoor to the no small Admiration of the Spectators and the no small Joy of my CoRival Nothing could give me and my Brethren both of the Buskin and the Sock who had any Regard for that School of Honour and Virtue the Stage more secret Indignation than to see it prostituted in so ignominious a Manner And what still added to our Resentment was the consummate Folly of the Town who crouded to the House a great Number of Nights to see the  Tall Man  But I had yet other Reasons to be no Friend to this  Tall Man  It regretted my Soul frequently and oft when on Buskins a Foot and a half high I was to personate a great Heroe and had my wavy Plume high o'er my  Brow Nod ever and anon with tragic Grace yet was I thought diminutively great and rais'd the Audience to a mock Laugh while hethat  Orion  that  Polephemus  of a Man with an Inanity of Voice and Gesture excited Wonder and Applause  Pudet haec opprobria Nobis  Et dici potuisse non potuisse reselli  After this  tall Man  was gone we had a  tall Woman  and after that  Sadler's Wells Tumbling  It is true this pleas'd the Mob and brought Money nor was this Custom new Did not the late Mr  Rh  act in the same Manner by this Humour  "  C Cibber  's Apology p  In this Notion says Mr  Cibber  he kept no Medium for in my Memory he carried it so far that he was some Years before this Time actually dealing for an extraordinary large Elephant at a certain Sum for every Day he might think fit to show the tractable Creature's Genius of that vast quiet Creature in any Play or Farce in the Theatre then standing in  Dorset Garden  But from the Jealousy so formidable a Rival had raised in the Dancers and by his Bricklayer's assuring him that if the Walls were open'd wide enough for his Enterance it might endanger the Fall of the House he gave up his Project But at the same Time of being under this Disappointment he put in Practice another Project of as new though not of so bold a Nature which was introducing a Set of Rope Dancers into the same Theatre for the first Day of whose Performance he had given out some Play in which I had a material Part But I was hardy enough to go into the Pit and acquaint the Spectators near me that I hop'd they would not think it a Disrespect to them if I declin'd acting upon any Stage that was brought to so low a Disgrace as ours was like to be by that Day's Entertainment My Excuse was so well taken that I never after found any ill Consesequences or heard the least Disapprobation of it And the whole Body of Actors protesting against  such an Abuse of their Profession our cautious Master was too much intimidated to repeat it"  Now I was not hardy enough to make any publick Remonstrances on this Occasion for I had a Point to carry which was to fix my Wife's Character as an Actress whose first Performance was to be closed with these  Sadler  's  Wells Tumblers  On this Account it was my Business to be as well with the  Master  as possible and though I from my Soul abhor'd such Measures yet no one was more bustling and commendatory in the Design than myself By this I not only show'd an Attachment to his Interest but kept myself on good Terms with the other Minister But had I thought it would have been any  Gain  to me to have  distress'd  the Master by making any Remonstrances my Father's  Hardiness  should not have come up to mine for I would not have gone sneaking into the Pit in huggermugger Not I truly But bounce upon the Stage with blustering Mood have stalk'd and made a speech which with pathetick Air in Words and Action had represented our Disasters dire and though they had hiss'd again and yet again I'd have stood 'em all till they had heard me outOn this ingenuous Confession of how I did act or how I would have acted some may say  Are these Principles honourable Is not  this  servile Flattery and  that  scandalous InjusticeAre not Favours received strong Obligations for Gratitude  Well Sir  Casuist  what of all this  Honour  and  Gratitude  and  this  and  that  and  t'other  are quite  different Things  according to the receiv'd Notions of  different Places  for what is  dishonourable  and  immoral  in  England  may be thought quite otherwise among the  Hottentots  A Man in  London  may be thought odd if he offers his  Wife  for his  Friend's Service  yet it is well known several Nations of  Negroes  practise it even to Strangers If  Morality  is  local  as I have fully prov'd I have prov'd also there may be much  Difference  between  theatrical Honour  and  common Honour  Now my Notion of  theatrical Honour  is to act only for your own  Convenience  and you can do no  Injustice  if you serve  yourself  If I should now be pertly ask'dWhat THE' where are thy Morals Hast thou no  Conscience  Yes I have but  what then That I have embrac'd the Philosophy of Mr  Colley Cibber  I told the Reader in a prior Chapter and what does that great and good Man say in his three hundredth Page  "I did it against my  Conscience  and had not Virtue to starve by opposing a Multitude that would have been too hard for meHad  Harry the Fourth of  France a better Excuse for changing his Religion I was still in my Heart on the Side of  Truth  and  Sense  but I had their Leave to quit them when they could not support me for what Equivalent could I have found for my falling a Martyr to them"  O most admirable Doctrine The Plea of  Convenience  is a full Answer for a Breach of  Conscience  Is not this a Doctrine that  Machiavel  himself might have boasted Having here observ'd on what Maxims I and my Father act some of our late Conduct which shall be consider'd in a subsequent Chapter may now be easily accounted for Though our Notions may be exploded by some Mr  Colley Cibber  has among M  nkind more Disciples than Mr  George Whitfield  and this I am sure of their Zeal is stronger as there are many who die  Martyrs  to his Doctrine every  Sessions  at the  OldBailey  having liv'd in a full Faith that to do what they think  convenient  is to do  right  There is a private Anecdote of my Life which is a Proof how early I imbib'd this convenient Opinion I have indeed often related it to my theatrical Acquaintance with much Glee of Heart and boastful Satisfaction but as I would be by this Apology  Toto notus in orbe Theophilus  I cannot resist the Temptation of inserting it in these my Memoirs You must know Reader that even by the Time I had reach'd my eighth Year my Papa said I was a sad  young Dog  and upon some Prank I had play'd I was in some Disgrace It happen'd I went into his Chamber to endeavour a Reconciliation one Morning and as he had gone to Bed in his Cups over Night he had I suppos'd drop'd a couple of Guineas out of his Breeches be that how it will I saw the two pretty sparkling Rogues lie at the Edge of the Carpet by his Bedside What does I but Slap runs to the happy Spot fell on my Knees and like a good and dutiful Child cried out in a devout  Tone  Pray Father bless me and pray to Gd to bless me and make me his true and faithful Servant for ever and ever  AmenHe surpris'd at such a sudden Strain of filial Duty for I don't believe I ever ask'd him Blessing twice before in my whole Life stroak'd me down the Head and bid me rise by which Time I had by Slight of Hand touch'd the Spankers and convey'd them snug into my Pocketand he will never have heard of them since till he reads this  Apology  for such an Action that as I thought they would be a  Convenience  to me my  Conscience  was not too dainty to take them  E minimis majora  All this Harangue on my Philosophy is necessary though it may seem odd to many Readers because it is an  apologetical  Defence for every Action of my Life at once I may indeed illustrate it by more Instances in the Sequel of my Story but shall now return where this Digression beganThe Company went on under Mr  Fd  with very great Success equal to the greatest under  Cibber Wilks  and  'Booth  As for me I was occasionally more or less in his Favour and Interest as it suited my own Convenience for he show'd me many Instances of his Readiness to serve me and was on all Occasions prompt and ready to do Acts of  Friendship  and  good Nature  The Stage was then as well rul'd by  my Assistance  as a Gentleman not brought up to it cou'd rule it yet as it was my Opinion and several other Players that  no Gentleman  is proper for the  Master  of a  Theatre  we were not absolutely contented and we did not want for  Grumbletonians  in a  theatric Government  We knew indeed that our  Master  had redeem'd us from a thousand Inconveniencies we had labour'd under gave us our own Terms but yet we did not look upon him with an equal Eye and thought that Actors were the only proper and fit Persons to rule over Actors and receive all the Profits of a Theatre These I say were Maxims that the chiefest Actors embrac'd and inculcated into others as the fundamental Rights of our Constitution On this the Company became uneasy and form'd themselves into little Factions and Cabals but which could not then have been attended with any ill Consequences to the Patentee But these little Murmurings  were greatly heighten'd by the following Event On the late Act for licensing the Number of Stages taking Place Mr  Giffard  's Company acting then at  Lincoln'sInnFields  to whom Mr  Rich  had let it were oblig'd to break up and provide for themselves in the acting Companies as well as they could Mr  Fd  on this Occasion took severa into  DruryLane  and to make Way for them dismiss'd several who had long been appertaining to that Theatre Mrs  Giffard  and Mr  Giffard  were themselves likewise afterwards engag'd This gave new Uneasiness to the old Stock for we look'd on them in a contemptible Light and when the Season came on and Parts were cast to these  exotic  Actors still more and more murmuring Taunts and Jealousies arose The Master favour'd several of these additional Recruits in a particular Manner and seem'd to make them his Confidents and Favourites This still made more Faction in our State till at last it was divided into two Parties the  RiffRaffs  and the  Scabs  The first were the Master's Party the latter  mine  his were as the present Courtiers and mine as the  Patriots  The Titles may seem coarse to the Ears of Delicacy but why not as good and significant as the present Names of Distinction in  Sweden  the  Hats  and the  NightCaps  or indeed as our own  Whig  and  Tory  Another notable Mark of Distinction was the Master's Party instituted a famous  Club  of  RiffRaffs  call'd the  OxCheekClub  and this was erected on the Ruins of a Club which the old  DruryLane  Company had formerly erected These PartyDivisions are in a theatrical Government as prejudicial to the publick Good as in a political one The Business of the Stage was not follow'd with that Spirit and Alacrity as when Unanimity reigns in the Hearts of the People I did I frankly confess what a theatrical Patriot should do foment all the Discord raise all the Jealousies in order at a proper Time and Season to raise a Rebellion and bring about a new Revolution and these Sentiments of  Patriotism  have been since very serviceable to me in another Respect for in my  political Essays  which I had the Honour to write in Defence of the  Present Administration  I have charg'd all these Maxims home upon the Gentlemen in  the CountryParty for my Father has prov'd the Rules for the  Stage  and  State  are the same in Parallel so also must be those of  Patriotism  About this Time also I found the Wings of my Power clip'd in Relation of presiding over Rehearsals and brought on one Morning a round Quarrel between  Qn  and  Me  for I had long look'd on him as a proud imperious Blockhead and he on me as a vain impertinent Coxcomb and perhaps we might both be somewhat right in our Conjectures In this Contest I valued nothing so much as his Contempt of  Me  for on my smart cutting Repartees on him he cry'd with a  Laugh Quarrelling with such a Fellow is like shtg  on a  Td  walking off as cool as a CucumberAnd that was the Sire of the Rencounter we afterwards had at the  Bedsord  CoffeeHouse All these Affairs happening and my Trial not turning out to my Favour my Soul became chagrin'd both with the Place and my Master I was therefore resolved to leave that Stage and for such Reasons as you will meet with in the Sequel of my Story Therefore as soon as my Benefit was over I determin'd according to an old Practice I had got of being of no more Service to the Master that Season to appear no more that Year and indeed no more at all while he was concern'd thereRetiring therefore from  CoventGarden  into the more agreeable and convenient Air of  CharingCross  I flung off the  Comedian  and commenc'd  Politician  but as by entering on that Subject I shall begin a new Farce it would be more proper to let the Curtain of this Chapter drop here  CHAP IX  The Author steps out of his Way Turns Mnstrl WriterThe Reasons why Some chimerical Thoughts of making the Stage useful  "_A Quiet Time in History says Mr  Colley Cibber  like a Calm in a Voyage leaves us but in an indolent Station To talk of our Affairs when they were no longer ruffled by Misfortunes would be a Picture without a Shade a flat Performance at best"  This is his  Apology  for the Relation of his  stepping out of the Way  and turning Pleader at the Bar nor can I make any better for telling how I became a  Mal Writer  The Affairs at  DruryLane  went on too successful for me to carry some Views I had into immediate Execution therefore I thought it would be best to pave my Way to my Project by engaging the Favours of the  Minister  and becoming his Advocate in Print In this I thought to kill two Birds with one Stone as I could at the same Time take an Opportunity of revenging myself to the full on Mr  Fltd  by  satirizing  him not only as to his  theatrical Affairs  but with Regard to his  private Oeconomy  Accordingly I went to work and wrote a Pamphlet call'd the  Country Correspondent  in which I have shewn a Specimen of my moral theatrical political and gallant Character Some People immediately knew the Author for  we  great Authors are soon found out let us take what Care we will to conceal ourselves If I or Mr  Pope  or my  Father  were to write any Thing without setting our Names to it we should be discover'd in six Lines reading the Stile the Manner the Thoughts would all glare out Perfection and the inimitable  Ja ne scai quoy  would distinguish the Author On my publishing the  Country Correspondent  and being known for its  Sire  many were the Criticisms upon it Some called me a  Coxcomb  for writing so much upon  myself  Some called me a  base impudent Fellow  for publishing such Invectives against Mr  Fltd  who had been my  Friend  Others fell foul on me because I had openly boldly and strenuously espoused the Cause of the  Minister  As for being called a  Coxcomb  I had been so long us'd to it that it seem'd as natural to me as my own Name nor did the Accusations against me for libelling Mr  Fltd  give me any Pain They who had odd Notions of  Honour  and  Honesty  said that I was an ungrateful Rascal and this and that and t'other but they might as well have sung Psalms to a Cow for my  Philosophy  could  away with it  What I did was conveniently necessary and if from being an obliged Friend I became a mortal Enemy what more is it than what frequently happens among  Ministers  of  State  and  Rulers  of  Empires Augustus  and  Antony  had their fierce Contest for the World and what was the Cause of the Quarrel between Sir  Rt We  and Mr  Py  but Ambition in the one and a Disregard of his Claims in the other In all theatrical as well as political Divisions to succeed in your Design you must go through  thick  and  thin  the Sword of  Defiance  is drawn and the Scabbard must be thrown away Every one who has read  Machiavel  knows these Tenets are justifiable therefore whatever  Falshood Scandal Infamy  and  Ingratitude  my  Country Correspondent  might have contain'd against Mr  Fltd  yet it being consistent with my  private Views  no one who knows Men and Things can blame me for I shall explain myself by giving some Reasons which were then in Embrio why I so acted I had determined to be as well with the  Msty  as possible and to merit something from them I undertook first to be a Kind of an  Informer  of what they call'd theatrical Secrets Our Master had publickly espous'd the Party in Opposition to the  Mstr  and was firmly attach'd to the Interest of the Pof  W  This Conduct I heard was resented by the  Mstr  with whom he had once been on very good Terms I thought  therefore any private Intelligence against the Master if I could possibly make it a  political  Concern would be an Introduction to his Favour and assist my future Scheme An Incident happen'd as favourable as I could wish A certain  Irish Author  was writing a  Tragedy  which was by his Friends who were reckon'd the tiptop Criticks in Town said to be a Performance of such extraordinary Merit that no Tragedy since  Shakespear  's Time could equal it either for the  Sublimity  of the  Ideas  the  Dignity  of the  Stile  the  Nobleness  of the  Subject  and the  Conduct  of the  Scene  That it was wrote in the Defence of  Freedom  and had such Speeches that at that  Crisis  of Time it would run as long as  Cato  had at another particular  Crisis  This  dainty Tragedy  was the much nois'd much subscrib'd for GUSTAVUS VASA written by HENRY BROOKE  Esq  The Master had great Expectations from it and though it had been often read in private Company before it was brought to the House yet I knew little of it till then as I was look'd upon as a Malecontent to the Master and consequently out of the Secrets of the Ministry But as soon as it had been read in the GreenRoom and the Parts deliver'd out to the Actors and I was acquainted perfectly with the Play I was determined I would take such Measures that it should not be acted which would shew to the Minister what Zeal I had for his Service and at the same Time indulge that Spirit of Revenge which I had against the Master Now what does I but represented to Mrno Matter for his Namebut it was the proper Person to make such an  Information  to that this same Tragedy of  Gustavus Vasa  was a scandalous Libel against the Government and some Lines in the Praise of Liberty were so introduc'd as to make strong  Inuendoes  that the Liberty of  England  was in Danger This I represented with such a Vehemence of Words and Action that it gain'd Credit and before it was ready to be perform'd it was prohibited by my  Lord Chamberlain  The Prohibition open'd the Mouths and Hearts of the Admirers of this Tragedy and they talk'd roundly about the Injustice and Oppression the Author and the Master of the Playhouse met with which they attributed to the Fear the  Ministry had of its being perform'd on the Stage Now to give my own impartial Thoughts on this Affair I avow that I believe there was no Harm in the Play nor do I think it would have met with that great Success as was expected from it for on the Publication it was not judg'd near equal to the Character that had been given it However I cannot but make this Observation that from the Action on the Stage and the Assistance of the Scenes and Actors it might have received such additional Strength that it might by the further Aid of a Party have had a Run of ten Nights And here I must observe again that it was with great Policy and Prudence that the Minister obtain'd the  Licensing Act  for though the  Liberty  of the  Press  allows a refus'd Play to be printed yet the Reading of it in the Closet will not convey an adequate Idea to the Representation on a Theatre Mr  Colley Cibber  who is a most strenuous  Champion  for the  Licensing Act  has fully consider'd this Difference between a Performance  printed  only and when it is actedThus he argues  C Cibber  's Apology p    "It was said that this Restraint upon the Stage would not remedy the Evil complain'd of That a Play refus'd to be licens'd would still be printed with double Advantage when it should be insinuated that it was refus'd for some Strokes of Wit and would be more likely then to have its Effect among the People However natural this Consequence may seem I doubt it will be very difficult to give a  printed  Satire or Libel half the Force or Credit of an  acted  one The most artful or notorious Lye or strain'd Allusion that ever slander'd a great Man may be read by some People with a Smile of Contempt or at worst it can but impose on one Person at once But when the Words of the same plausible Stuff shall be repeated on a Theatre the Wit of it among a Crowd of Hearers is liable to be overvalued and may unite and warm a whole Body of the Malicious and Ignorant into a Plaudit Nay the partial Claps of only twenty illminded Persons among several hundred of silent Hearers shall and  often have been mistaken for a general Approbation and frequently draw into their Party the Indifferent or the Inapprehensive who rather than not be thought to understand the Conceit will laugh with the Laughers and join in the Triumph But alas the quiet Reader of the same ingenious Matter can only like for  himself  and the Poison has a much slower Operation upon the Body of a People when it is so retail'd out than when told to a full Audience by Wholesale The single Reader too may happen to be a sensible unprejudic'd Person and then the merry Dose meeting with the Antidote of a sound Judgment perhaps may have no Operation at all With such a one the Wit of the most ingenious Satire will only by its intrinsic Truth or Value gain upon his Approbation or if it be worth an Answer a printed Falshood may positively be confounded by printed Proofs against it But against Contempt and Scandal heighten'd by the Skill of an Actor ludicrously infusing it into a Multitude there is no immediate Defence to be made or equal Reparation to be had for it would be but a poor Satisfaction at last after lying long patient under the Injury that Time only is to shew which would probably be the Case that the Author of it was a desperate Indigent that did it for Bread How much less dangerous and offensive then is the  written  than the acted Scandal The Impression the Comedian gives it is a Kind of double Stamp in the Poet's Paper that raises it ten Times to the intrinsic Value  Upon the whole if the Stage ought ever to have been reform'd if to place a Power somewhere of restraining its Immoralities was not inconsistent with the Liberties of a civiliz'd People neither of which any moral Man of Sense can dispute might it not have shewn a Spirit too poorly prejudic'd to have rejected so rational a Law only because the Honour and Office of a Minister might happen in some small Measure to be protected by it"  I must annotate that all that is said here in Reference to comic Satire and the Comedian is  vice versa  equally applicable to the Tragedy and Tragedian For  when a mad brain'd tragic Author has stream'd into a Patriotic Stile pompously rolling into vilifying Periods signifying roundly nothing but Invectives against a Minister the pompous Buskins and Plumes of Tragedy together with the Aspect and Elocution of the Tragedian so speak and play with the Imagination that they deceive the Judgment and win over many Spectators who might have thought them scandalous Bombast had they been read soberly in the Closet This as I observ'd was the Fate of  Gustavus Vasa  Esq  for after the Prohibition the Author publish'd Advertisements for a Subscription aad in those Advertisements made his Cause the Cause of the Publick insinuating it was refus'd for some Strokes of Liberty which were disagreeable to People in Power This indeed answer'd his Ends in point of Profit for being the first Play refus'd since the Commencement of the Act People's Curiosity were rais'd not only by wanting to see the prohibited Play out of political Reasons but because it was said by common Rumour to be a most excellent Tragedy The Profit of the Subscription was equal to what his most sanguine Hopes might have promis'd him from the Stage As this may be the most proper Place for it I must insert another Remark on refus'd Plays After this Success of the Subscription of  Gustavus Vasa  all the tragic Bards who were under the Influence of Mr  Ltttn  Prime Minister at  Nrfk  House threw into bombast Scenes all the PatriotLiberty Flights their own little Geniuses could suggest or their Patron and Court of Assistants could muster up Some indeed say they did not on this Occasion insert any Thing new but that they had all from the first wrote according to their Instructions and had fill'd their Scenes with the wornout unfashionable Notions of Liberty and publick Spirit The next refus'd Plays were the  Edward  and  Eleonara  of Mr  Thompson  at  CoventGarden  and a Tragedy wrote by Mr  Pattison  at  DruryLane  both of which were publish'd by Subscription and advertis'd that they fell the Martyrs to Freedom publick Spirit and the Devil and all But as the homely Proverb says Enough is as good as a Feast The Publick had been cram'd by  Esq  Gustavus  to Satiety and Satiety  from a natural Effect it has on the Generality of Stomachs of Mankind will not allow an Avidity for more for as Mr  Colley Cibber  philosophically and beautifully observes  C Cibber  's Apology p    What Pleasure is not languid to Satiety  Ditto  p  Satiety puts an End to all Taste that the Mind of Man can delight in  Therefore their Subscriptions fell short of Mr  Brooks  's considerably and I believe the PatriotPoets begin now to feel the ill Consequences of an Opposition to a certain great Man as much as the Merchants The Merchants would have a War and they have had their Hearts full of it The Poets would write up to a Refusal and I believe they begin heartily to repent it  We  of the Court have I gad given them their Bellies full I and Sir  R t  play all the Game and let us shuffle the Cards theatrically or patriotically we still turn up Knave But halt a little most gracious Reader in the Fulness of my Heart I have digress'd so long that I don't know where I digress'd from But that is just my Father's Way for as we write so we do but write on 'tis sufficient as for Method and Connexion we leave them to your little Geniuses our Irregularity in writing like our Irregularity in living is more beautiful from its Deformity Were we not singularly eminent we might die unnoted by Fame but it is our Extravaganzas in Life which mark us out to the  Gaze  and  Wonder  of the present Age and the  inexpressible Somewhat  in our Apologies will record us the most notable  Par nobile  of the Year excepting with due Submission that great  Par nobile Fratrum  who in  A str n  and  Negociation  have so eminently distinguish'd themselves to all  Europe  But seriously to recover the Clue of my History from having given Reasons why I abus'd Mr  F d  in my ministerial Essays I digress'd to my turning  Informer  about  Gustavus Vasa  and so deduc'd some historical Anecdotes concerning that dainty Piece and added some political Remarks from  Cibber  's Apology in Defence of the  licensing Act  Let me see Ay it  was soI will now draw the Back Scene of my Proceedings and still enlarge the Prospect It was in the Vacation of last Summer when having retreated from  CoventGarden  I retir'd to  CharingCross  My Enemies gave out that I went there for some trifling Sums I had run in Debt for at Mrs  Stwd  's and some other fashionable reputable BawdyHouses in  CoventGarden  Piazzas Vile Insinuation How weak the Understanding of Man to account for Conduct of great Men when they are ignorant upon what Principles they moveWhat reflective Witticisms and Inuendoes have been flung at Sirabout this secret Expedition which has been so long fitting out What Things have been said about a Suspension or Cessation of Arms and I don't know what when at the same Time the great Man acts upon other Measures than they guess and intends to proceed on other Motives than they imagineI was us'd in the same Manner as to my  secret Expedition  to  CharingCross  And as it is now over and to put such fruitless Revilers to the Blush I will tell them my Motives to it  Imprimis  as I was going to commence Mal Writer it was proper I should live near the Mr not only for more easily attending his Levees but to be more readily sent for to attend a private Conference and receive Instructions whom I was to lash what I was to defend what gainsay when to give the evasive and when the downright Lie All which Things are necessary for a Writer to know who has such a Patron to defendAs for the Frequency of my private Conferences and the Nature of my Instruction I shall prudently be silent Instructions given to Ambassadors tho' mov'd for by Members of the House of Cs to be laid before them are not to be revealed in such a Manner But as to my frequenting a  Levee  in  Downingstreet  that is notoriously known and I can say with some Elevation of Heart few in his Circle were more distinguish'd for their Sense Learning Virtue Honour Policy Ability and Eloquence than your little humble Servant  T C  But besides these Reasons my Printer and Publisher lived at that Place and it is best for an Author to confer with his Printer very often as how the Sale goes on and whether any Cash  is become due without mentioning the Necessity of correcting the Sheets from the Press for what a sad Figure an Author makes in Print who don't know how to make his Stops I therefore always stop my Works myself though as for the Spelling I leave that to the Printer's Boy Sure then these are sufficient Reasons to take off the Obloquy that was cast on me that vile  Catchpoles  drove me to a Place which I out of mere Policy retired to Well there it was I composed my  Country Correspondents  in all which I continued my Attack on Mr  Fltd  and in a miscellaneous rhapsodical Way defended the P Mr Tooth and Nail In Taverns I eat for him drank for him talk'd for him and when I went home about Four o'Clock in the Morning I wrote for him  Aurora Musis Amica  Then wou'd I write about it and about it  I continued this zealous and satirical Fury for the whole Summer nor did I write  County Correspondents  only but sometimes occasional  Gazetteers  in both which Kinds of Writing I equally succeeded  This strenuous Attachment of mine to the  Administration  drew on me the Abuse of the  Country Party  and I was libell'd under the Character of  Pistol  in a scandalous Paper call'd  Common Sense  The Author of that Journal is a profligate forging Fellow for he inserted Letters from  Pistol  with an Insinuation as I go by the Name of  Pistol  that they came from me which was as  notorious  a  Fib  as his Predecessor  Mist  told of  Colley Cibber  and I take this Opportunity to avow to the whole World that I never had any thing to do with  Common Sense  nor ever will Fron my  Soul  I  heartily  despise it and from this Moment till  Atropos  with fatal Shears shall snip the spinning Thread of vital Life  Common Sense  and I are Enemies and so Mr  Common Sense  your humble Servant But it seems my great Apologist himself was droll'd upon for his Statewritings I mean the Comedy of the  NonJuror  and  Myn  er Keyber  was a standing Joke till at last  Mist  fairly kill'd him Take the Story in his own Words  "Soon after the  NonJuror  had receiv'd the Favour of the Town I read in one of  Mist  's Journals the following short Paragraph  Yesterday died Mr  Colley Cibber  late Comedian of the Theatre Royal notorious for writing the  NonJuror The Compliment in the latter Part I confess I did not dislike because it came from so impartial a Judge and it really so happen'd that the former Part was very near true for I had just that very Day crawl'd out after having been some Weeks laid up with a Fever However I saw no Use in being thought to be thoroughly dead before my Time and therefore had a Mind to see whether the Town cared to have me alive again So the Play of the  Orphan  being to be acted that Day I quickly stole myself into the Part of the  Chaplain  which I had not been seen in for many Years before The Surprize of the Audience at my unexpected Appearance on the very Day I had been dead in the News and the Paleness of my Looks seem'd to make it a Doubt whether I was not the Ghost of my real Self departed But when I spoke their Wonder eas'd itself by Applause which convinc'd me they were then satisfy'd that my Friend  Mist  had told a  Fib  of me Now if simply to have shewn myself in broad Life and about my Business after he had notoriously reported me dead can be called a Reply it was the only one which his Paper while alive ever drew from me But my particular Offence of writing the  NonJuror  has made me more honourable Friends than Enemies the latter of which I am not unwilling should know that that Part of the Bread I now eat was given me for having writ the  NonJuror  "  This shows that though we State Writers are jok'd upon yet Reward makes up for these Squibs of Drollery I may be ask'd why I was so voluntary a Champion for the Mr and why I relate this Account of State Writing and intersperse political Memoirs and Remarks in this Apology as they do not immediately relate to the History of the Stage Some  John Trot  may sagely reply that I write in this Manner merely to imitate the Manner of  Colley Cibber  But Mr  Trot  you are mistaken  Colley Cibber  interspers'd  Defences  of  Lord Chamberlain's Power  and  Licensing Act  for the same Reason that I wrote  Country Correspondents  and  Gazetteers  to create Merit with the My which we at a proper Time migh make use of The private Reason of writing these and abusing Mr  Fltd  all tended to the same Point I have often promis'd to tell them to the Reader and the Secret shall lie no longer a Burden to me but out it shall  Mr  Colley Cibber  retired from the Stage having  patiently  sold his Share of the Patent to Mr  Highmore  when he had  managed  him so that he had got  his own Price  and then he  wish'd the Crew he left in the Vessel a good Voyage  yet says he  "though it began to grow late in Life with me having Health and Strength enough to have been as useful on the Stage as ever I I was under no visible Necessity of quitting of it"  As an undoubted Proof of that he has several Seasons since on very valuable Considerations from Mr  Fd  perform'd occasionally on the Stage But though he had quitted the Theatre and sold his Share in it when he had staid with new Patent  and made them think it worth their while to come up to his Price yet the sweet Profits of the Management of a Theatre remain'd strongly in his Mind and notwithstanding all his Professions of the Love of Retirement he would gladly have been reinstated in the Government of a Theatre could he have obtain'd such an Office and not to have cost him any Thing Now as he knew that I was a strong Malecontent at  DruryLane  and was sensible what Torrents of Ambition roll'd tumultuously o'er my Soul having deriv'd their Source from his own Spring he was assured that I would come into any Scheme that would sooth my Ambition and put me at the Head of a Company  ver which I was to have any  profitable  Share of the Management for  Ambition  will be but an inglorious Passion if not founded upon  Interest  It is the  Utile Dulci  should govern the Thoughts and Actions of the rational Part of Mankind Acquainted with my Principles and having seen what an  Achitophel  I was in theatric Policy how adroit in raising Commotions  stirring up Revolts heading Rebellions and bringing about Revolutions he thought proper to communicate to me a Design of gaining over to his Interest some principal Players of  DruryLane  Company and then setting up a new Company under a License which he did not doubt for his great Merit and Services he could easily obtainThis Scheme jump'd with my own Way of Thinking and I came into it with Heart and Hand nor did he omit hinting to me that his only Motive to such a Design  when it began to grow late in Life with him  was purely to retrieve the Honour of the  British Theatre  and leave me handsomely provided for Now though I knew he did not care a Rush for me nor would out of pure Love give me a Farthing to keep me from the Gallows yet I had learn'd Art enough to disguise my real Opinion and give his Proposal the Turn he would have it take Having resolved on this Design we did secretly all we could to bring it about for your important Schemes cannot be executed as soon as plan'd and therefore we were oblig'd to wait a proper Opportunity which was while the Articles of some of the principal Actors under Mr  Fltd  were expired In the mean Time last Summer to deserve something from the My when I should petition for any Favour  more Paterno  I took up my Pen wrote  Country Correspondents  and  Gazetteers  in Defiance of  Common Sense  and all its AdherentsSo Mr  Reader  you now know for what Reason I commenc'd  Politician  Well methinks I hear some  John Trot  object and sayIs writing  Country Correspondents  and  Gazetteers  of such ConsequenceYes Sir to write as I did and lay about me like a  Drawcansir  and all that Sir is look'd on as meritorious and Merit is to be rewardedAll that Summer was chiefly spent in  Politicks  and  Amours  for I as well as Sir or must have my Relaxations and Divertisements after the Concerns of a Nation have been pothering in my BrainI remember the old Maxim  Interpone tuis interdum gaudia Curis  Which I thus render  Sometimes the Cares of Empire to remove  Retreating to your Miss indulge your Love  A Maxim I always follow when fatigued either with the Affairs of the  State  or the  Stage  and the Example of my Betters keep me in Countenance when I make this publick Confession of itTo returnThat my Politicks would not support me I soon found out though had a particular  Right Honourable Gentleman  taken me more particularly under his Patronage it might have been worth  his  While as well as  mine  I might have been of great Service to him for I could have made as good a  BustleMasterGeneral  in St  Sts  's  Chapel  as behind the  Scenes  Of this I gave him a Hint in one of my Pamphlets and told him with what an Air the  young Captain  could Ioll in his  Chariot  while it roll'd down to the House and that he could make Speeches to a  Senate  as well as to an AudienceBut if People can't take a Hint whose Fault is that Perhaps he wanted more explicit Explanation but my  consummate Modesty  not suffering me to make such an Attempt it may have been my DisappointmentHowever I have this Consolation I am not the first Man of  Merit  who have suffer'd by that simple VirtueAs I was not taken such Notice of as my Vanity had suggested I deserv'd I retreated from the ServiceThe Practice of all great Men on such Occasions  Scipio and others have done it  As I was resolv'd not to act with Mr  Fd  again and he equally resolv'd not to  let  me I engaged with Mr  Rich  and appear'd on  CoventGarden Theatre  I so manag'd Matters that I soon became  BustleMasterGeneral  there and made the UnderActors and UnderServants of the Theatre know who they had got among them As my Enemies will allow I am a clever Fellow in my Way I must here mention the Success I met with in my theatrical Way I had long sighed to perform the Character of  Bayes  in the  Rehearsal  but my own Fears and my Father's inimitable Action still so fresh in every Memory clip'd the Wings of my Ambition However I was resolv'd to make a Push at it and propos'd to my  new Master the getting up the  Rehearsal  Rehearsal said heumph And who can do  Bayes  O Sir says I you need not have ask'd that Question when you have taken me into your CompanyUmph says heand took a Pinch of Snuff and remain'd silentI urg'd the Thing and what Houses it would bring if I had the Management of getting it up His Answer came from him by half Sentences and Inuendoes and Pinches of Snuff as  No 'Twont do  Snuff  The Character The Character of Bayes supported it 'Twas a Hazard 'Twou'd be an Expence Wou'd advise me not to think of it  Snuff  My Father indeed to have play'd it might do something The Town wou'd make Comparisons Perhaps not for my Advantage The Expences in short wou'd be too considerable  Here it was easy to understand him I therefore propos'd to him to add such a ludicrous Spectacle as by his Advice and Assistance might bring great Audiences though a Thing of a trivial Nature Here I knew I should tickle him In short I propos'd to reinforce  Bayes's Troops  and with a new Set of  Hobby Horses  raise two new Regiments who should Exercise in martial Order upon the Stage and by their capering and prancing like menag'd WarHorses divert the Multitude and that the  Captandum vulgus  he knew was the  sine qua non  in the Theatre This did all I wanted he came into my Scheme and was so very full of the additional Troops that he undertook to  raise  them  himself  which he not only did but attended at all their  Exercises  and  Musters  and  Reviews  was  RidingMaster AdjutantGeneral  and  Generalissimo  When it was perform'd I met with an Applause might satisfy the greatest Vanity and my  HobbyHorse Regiments  had as great Applause as myself The remaining Part of the Season went on with great Success to the Master by my Rehearsal and my additional Troops had as many Spectators at  CoventGarden  as his M's Houshold Troops at a Review in  HydePark  This continu'd till the Master brought his  Orpheus  and  Eurydice  on the Stage after which there was no Occasion for Mr  Bayes  the  Twinkum Twankum  of Mr  Orpheus  and the  Metamorphoses  of  Monsieur Harlequin  put my Troops to the Rout However at the Close of the Season I made a Rally and brought myself and my Army for one Night more into the Field To explain I prevail'd with Mr  Rich  to let me have  another Benefit  the last Night but one of performing on the Theatre for this last Season I say  another  having had about  four  others within the Year  The Frequency of my having Benefits demands some Consideration in this Apology as some Persons have given themselves Airs to censure me for it and besides it may bring out some theatrical Anecdotes and Rules necessary for future and less experienc'd Actors As the having Benefits is suppos'd to raise a Sum of Money to reward an Actor and as it is raising it in an honest Way what Crime is it if an Actor could get a BenefitPlay every Week O but cries Mr  Oeconomist  who will buy but one PitTicket in a Season  This is an Imposition on the Publick and severe Tax on your Tradesmen your Acquaintance and your Acquaintence's Acquaintance  Ay it might seem so indeed if they were all as for  myself  but I have more Modesty to make unreasonable Requests In short Sir  Wisacre  there is an Art to conduct such Things with a Gloss and an Art of which I am the original Inventor I shall illustrate this by Matters of Fact as I practis'd them When I engag'd in that notorious Trial of my Cuckoldom I stood in Need of the Essence of Law for Money is the Sinews of Law as well as War and to raise it the easiest and only Way was by having a Benefit I ask'd Mr  F d  this as a Favour and a good natur'd Office to enable me to obtain Justice for my Heartwracking Injuries Though this was at a very good Part of the Season he compassionating my Necessities comply'd Now comes the Thing I thought at that Crisis having a Benefit in my own Name might be not so proper and without it you'll say how could you get a full House Why I found out a Way to have a Benefit and a full House and Nobody know it Not to keep you in Suspence I got my Father to play for me and Mr  F d  to let me have the House so it was done at once You'll say this was very friendly of the Master but that is allover Two Months after I had a Benefit in my own  Name that was mine by right and I need say no more on it But about three Months after I wanted another Benefit which was in the SummerSeason Then I was engag'd to Mr  Rich  and got Leave for the House and some BrotherActors to play  gratis  But I did not tell the Publick it was my Benefit No I knew better I touch'd them in a tender Point and told them it was to support my dear Infant Children which I had left by my first Wife  Jenny  And so put at the Top of the Bills  For the Benefit of Miss  Betty  and Miss  Molly  c  Some indeed saw through this Artifice but it pass'd current enough with the Majority At  Christmass  I was to have had another but the Weather prevented it I have had  another  in my Course among the Actors and  another  after them because I did not get enough by the former I must observe that on these Occasions I always find some Topick to display my  Oratory  on which I print at the Bottom of my Bills either as Advertisements or Remonstrances or Petitions or something or other and circulate them among the Gentry and Nobility Tradesmen Acquaintance and Strangers Besides which I generally speak an  Epilogue  of  Jo Haynes  's riding on an  Ass  and to shew how I can laugh at Persons calling me by MockNames I advertis'd it  to be spoke by the young Captain in his Regimentals riding on an Ass  This may seem a trifling Story to the  untheatrical Reader  but I write this to instruct Posterity who are engag'd in a Theatre by what Means they may manage their Affairs and I hope from these Hints some future Genius may find much Profit and Emolument  The Season being clos'd I again retir'd to  CharingCross  but not to write Politicks if the Reader has any Curiosity to know what important Affair I went thither for that I might safely negociate it let him peruse the Beginning of the subsequent Chapter  CHAP X  The Situation of Affairs at  DruryLane  TheatreThe Scheme to get a new Licence explain'dThe Reason for the Publication of Mr  C Cibber  's Apology givenThe Scheme miscarriesA most heroick RhapsodyA Dissertation on  Property  An Apology for writing another Chapter  _I Am now entering on a Theme which will surprize the Publick because it is such a Piece of secret History as will be a  Key  to several elaborate  Digressions  in the  Apology  of Mr  Colley Cibber  I must previously observe that in his historical Part of the Stage he was very well vers'd in the  Rebellions Revolts  and  Revolutions  of his Time till he had fix'd the Government of the Stage under a  Triumvirate  of which he himself was one and from the Time of his quiting his Share in the Patent no one is better vers'd in  Rebellions Revolts Revolutions Factions Oppositions  c c than  myself  Two Persons of such Experience might bring about great Things in a  theatrical State  more especially if the People were divided and Heats and Animosities were fomented among them I have acquainted the Reader of some great Design which was in Embrio and which we only wanted an Opportunity to execute This was for my Father after having rais'd Uneasinesses and Jealousies among Mr  Fd  's Company to obtain a Licence for a new CompanySome private Affairs of Mr  Fd  's gave us the Opportunity we so much desir'dFor as through the Confusion Things  were at  DruryLane  Theatre and through a violent Distemper he could not appear himself and a Report prevailing which we industriously rumour'd as Truth that he would never return to the Management of his Theatre again we could not only the better solicit the  Actors  but even the  Chamberlain  and with less Opposition To work we went and indeed we at first met with such hopeful Success that I was not a little elate and form'd much imaginary Triumph in my Heart However Mr  Fd  took such Measures as to the Actors that he thought maugre all our Projects he should be able to retain a good Company at  DruryLane  To traverse this Design and with a specious View of acting justly Mr  C y C r  represented to the L d  Ch n  that there was an absolute Necessity for having another Company form'd as Mr  F d  had very injuriously treated his chief Actors and that there were very large Arrears due to them To impose still the more on the  Ch n  there were some Actors waited on the L d  Ch n  introduced by Mr  C C  and made such Remonstrances as were thought proper Thus we carried on the Sollicitation which occasioned an Order to be sent to Mr  C d  Prompter of the Theatre that none of the Company should engage in any other Company or elsewhere without his Knowledge and Permission This we look'd in a Point gain'd in our Favour to prevent any Actors making fresh Agreements which Mr  Fd  thought some Persons view'd it in another Light and imagin'd it was to prevent any Actors going  from him  When these Negociations were thus carrying on we had we thought another favourable Incident Mr  Fd  was taken extremely ill of the Gout and he was in such Danger that his Life was despair'd of Nay it was reported one Night that he was  dead  and it was inserted as Truth in the  publick Papers  of next Day I first heard it at the  Tavern  and that was the Occasion of my  Bacchinalian Transports  Quo me Bacche rapis  c  in a prior Chapter But though this Report was false yet so dangerous an Illness prevented his b  stling about  as he might otherwise have done yet he managed so well that our Representation of the Affairs of  DruryLane Theatre  lost considerably of their Weight as great Part was on Examination found not to be strictly true and that Mr  C C  had notoriously utter'd several  Fibs  both of the State of  DruryLane  and the  Menager  of it  It may be objected that Mr  C C  and  myself  and  others  were very great  Scoundrels  to take such an Advantage of a Gentleman being in a desperate Illness and who had at a vast Expence purchas'd the Patent and had redeem'd the  Haymarket  Company from the desperate State they labour'd under Some added that not only taking such an Advantage was unjust but that telling  Fibs  were more soBut pray let me answer all Objectors Is not in the transacting all  State Affairs  between  Kings  and  Potentates  all advantageous Opportunities to be taken Does not  Policy  require when any Thing offers which may prove beneficial that without any Qualm of  Conscience  the  Prime M r  of any Kingdom is to make Use of it be it never so  unjust  or  detrimental  to a  Rival Power  Suppose the taking of  Carthagena  or even the Island of  Cuba  would break the haughty Heart of the  Queen  of  Spain  Is our Ministry to desist gaining Part of her Dominions for Fear of being the Death of her Not many People would think so Though perhaps that  tenderheartedness  of the  M r  may be the Reason why Admiral  Vernon  was not supported with  LandForces  But  Ne Sutor ultra Crepidam  Then Sir as for telling a few  Fibs  what mighty Matter is there in that when the  Fibs  may go a great Way to carry the Cause In all caballing theatrical or political Fibs are the most Essential requisite and moreover it is known in  Fibbing  you must  fib  roundly If it is not discover'd you ten to one impose on those you represent the State of the Case to and carry your Views And if you are discover'd 'tis only pleading that you yourself have been impos'd on by others Were all the  Fibbers  in a Court to take Shame to themselves for practising such an Art we might soon see some very great Men in Disgrace Then  why may not the  Fibbers  or  ibbers  of a Theatre take the same Scheme without any Reflection of Scandal I am so far from my thinking an Excellence in this Practice is any Reproach that as for my Part I value myself on it mightily and intend for the publick Good to write an  Essay  on the  Art  of  Fibbing  which I design to publish next Winter by Subscription But a thorough Answer to all moral Objections is mine and Mr  Colley Cibber  's  Philosophy  if our  Conscience  can  away with it  we may lay our Hands to our honest Hearts and vow we have acted like Men of  Honour  and who can gainsay us  The Reader now acquainted with these Anecdotes concerning Mr  Colley Cibber  may if they have read his Apology account not only for his political Essays on the Stage his  chimaerical  Thoughts for the Improvement of it but also for so true a Publication of it at the Time he was  solliciting a new Licence  As I am a candid Historian I will not conceal some Remarks which I have heard made when his  History  and his  Conduct  have been compar'd as if they were  inconsistent  with one another He is said throughout his  Apology  to have endeavour'd to prove that the  Multiplicity  of  Theatres  is contrary to the useful Consequences which may accrue from a wellgovern'd Stage True  "I know it is a common Opinion says he that the more Playhouses the more Emulation I grant it but what has this Emulation ended in Why a daily Contention who shall surfeit you with the best Plays So that when what  ought  to please can no longer please your Appetite is again to be rais'd by such monstrous Presentations as Dishonour the Taste of a civiliz'd People If indeed to our several Theatres we could raise a proportionable Number of good Authors to give them all different Employment then perhaps the Publick might profit from their Emulation But while good Writers are so scarce and undaunted Criticks so plenty I am afraid a good Play and a blazing Star will be equal Rarities"  *  Vide C Cibber  's Apology p  This has been urg'd as a Reason why Mr  Colley Cibber  should not have sollicited a Licence to have set up a new Company and that it was against his own Maxims But pray not so fast He remains in this Opinion still against the Multiplicity of Playhouses in the Main and if he had set up another it would have been only  in ordine ad  to have ruin'd Mr  F d  's Company and to have reduc'd the Number to  two  again To effect this he is such a Judge of  Taste  he would have given no  monstrous Presentations  but such as might have done an  Honour  to a  civiliz'd People  But then say you this he says himself could not be done without  good Authors  and  good Writers  are very scarce They are so but would there not have been HIMSELF and MYSELF to have entertain'd the Town so that all these sutile Objectio  s fall to the Ground Again says Mr  Objector  after Mr  Colley  has enter'd himself a  voluntary Champion  for restraining the Number of Playhouses and given the  Publick a Pourtrait of his Mind to let them see how far he is or is not a Blockhead when he pretends to talk of serious Matters above his Capacity  he thus strengthens his Arguments  "And now we have seen the Consequence of what many People contend for Variety of Playhouses How was it possible so many could subsist on what was to be seen How could the same Stock of Plays supply four Theatres which not well support two Had this Law been made seven Years ago I should not have parted with my Share in the Patent under a thousand Pounds more than I receiv'd for itSo that as far as I am able to judge both the Publick as Spectators and the Patentees as Undertakers are or might be in a Way of being better entertain'd and more considerable Gainers by it"  All this amounts to no more than as this Law prohibits an  unlicens'd  Number of Playhouses the Value of the Direction of a  Theatre  may increase and that Mr  Colley Cibber  might have been a very considerable Gainer if he  obtain'd  a  Licence  to have been an  Undertaker  of another We had such sanguine Hopes of Success that we had fix'd on the Place to have encamp'd in and have open'd our Campaign It  was the  Operahouse  in the  Haymarket  where the Revolters of his own Time fix'd but which he would have had alter'd to the Plan of  Drury Lane  this is hinted at in several Parts of the  Apology  but in Page he proves it a proper Spot and the Hopes that such a Project might succeed  "From the vast Increase of the Buildings  GrosvenorSquare c  I have mention'd the Situation of that Theatre has receiv'd considerable Advantages a new World of People of Condition are nearer to it than formerly and I am of Opinion that if the Auditory Part were reduc'd a little more to that of the Model of  DruryLane  an excellent Company of Actors would now find a better Account in it than in any other House in this populous City Let me not be mistaken I say an excellent Company and such as might be able to do Justice to the best Plays and throw those latent Beauties in them which only excellent Authors can discover or give Life to If such a Company were  now  there they would meet with a quite different Set of Auditors than other Theatres have been lately us'd to"  Here in his own Words you have the  GroundWork  of our Scheme And who is there can doubt but under  his  Direction and  mine  the  Morals  of a Theatre must have been  reform'd  for what by our  known Virtues  and experienc'd  Knowledge  of  Goodbreeding  we should have made our Theatre the School of  Manners Virtue  and  Politeness  For has he not in his  Chap II  Chimaerical Thoughts of making the Stage useful built a Theatre in the Air to prove  Apology p K  his Concern that the Theatres have not a better Pretence to the Care and further Consideration of those Governments where they are toleratedThere  WAS  a Time  adds he  and not yet out of many Peoples Memory when it subsisted upon its own rational Labours when even Success attended an Attempt to reduce it to Decency and when Actors themselves were hardy enough to hazard their Interest in the Pursuit of so dangerous a Reformation  Now as  all know what WAS may be again we flatter'd ourselves that we should have brought about a theatric Reformation And more especially from the  Publication  of the  Apology  having laboriously and zealously shewn in it what  "  C Cibber's  Apology p  Regard was always paid to the Power of a  Lord Chamberlain  and what Influence and Operation that Power must naturally have in all theatric Revolutions"  But oh thou curst inconstant fickleBch  Thou Strumpet Deity  FORTUNA  hight  Thou thou with painted Looks and Eyes alluring  Who smil'd delusive on my fairest Hopes  Just just upon the Brink of full Enjoyment  With jilting Mein thou turn'st thy Backside on me  And smil'st indignant at my aim'd Embrace  Curse on my wayward FateCurse on my Stars  Under what Star theatric was I born  Ye Gods why gave ye to me such a Soul  That swells and pants with such ambitious Throws  Yet Torture it with Disapointments vile  Fld  's superior Genius has undone me  HE Eagle  like o'er mea meer  TomTit  Tow'rs 'yond my Sight and mocks my aching View  But it is WellAnon and yet anon  The Goddess  Fair Occasion  call'd may smile  And I will catch her by her  Forelock  fast  For so the Fair is gain'dAnd so I sink  Into the calmer Thoughts of mild Philosophy  Oh gentle Reader excuse this heroic Agitation of my Soul the Thoughts of what I am going to tell you  hit the Cause that touch'd my Brain  and threw me into this passionate Rhapsody After all our Hopes after all our Negociations Sollicitations Representations Lucubrations and Apologies the Theatre  Colle  Cibber built in the Air  must still remain in  Nubibus though  Ditto  p  it was in a much better Taste than any he had seen and we have only now Leave to play with the Project in Fancy  In plain  English  my  Lord  Chamberlain  denied us a License on so foolish a Reason begging my Lord's Pardon for the Expression as he would not consent without any Foundation of Reason for us to invade a Gentleman's Property But my Lord has another Way of thinking as to moral Obligations than  C y C r  and however he may approve of him as an entertaining Companion he has no Opinion of him as a Moral Philosopher It is not becoming in me to call his  Grace's  Parts into Question nor do I They are above the Description of my Pen though that can sometimes soar such Heights as may be beyond the Ken of common Understanding But I may ask this digressive Question  What is  PROPERTYIt is merely having the Possession of a Thing which Possession gives a just Right to it till dispossess'd thereof For as Possession is universally allowed to be Nine Parts of the Law out of Ten it is to be supposed it is Nine Parts of Justice out of Ten and consequently should be the Ballance of every Man's ActionsAs for Instance If a Tradesman  viz  a Woollen Draper Haberdasher If a Tradesman  viz  a Woollen Draper Haberdasher Mercer Laceman  c  had particular Goods in their Shops their Goods during that Time are their Properties They are so Well the Taylor purchases some of them from the several Shops and they become  his  Now if I order the Taylor from those Goods to make me a handsome Suit of Cloaths and he makes them and delivers them to  me  will any one say they are the Property of the WoollenDraper Haberdasher Laceman  c  or Taylor No they are  mineAy  says Sir  Sneerer if you have paid for them  Ay Sir if I have not paid for them tooThe Cloaths  durante possessione  are legally mine and as my Property I wear themThe Taylor indeed may bring his Action at Law and then I play least in Sight but still wear the CloathsHe forces me to the Verge of the Law I still wear the Cloaths and till he is able to beat me out of all my strong Holds I make no Consideration of his Claim to them or an Equivalent for themProperty fluctuates and changes Masters 'Tis a quick Inheritance  Hae  es Haeredem velut unda supervenit undam  Forgive the Lowness of my Illustration and making myself an Example But Truth is Truth however mean the Object may be that demonstrates it If you would have a more elevated Idea behold the fluctuating Property of the greatest Empires and Kingdoms of the World Your  Medes  and your  Persians  are no longer govern'd by their  Cyrus  's and  Darius  's  Alexander  's Family are not in Possession of the territorial Property which he himself took from othersBut why need I be prodigal of my historical LearningDoes not the illustrious  Kouli Kan  at this very Day make the Dominions of the  Sophi  of  Persia  his Property and has he not made the vast Riches and Provinces of the  Great Mogul  his Property and is he not meditating to make other Provinces of the  Ottoman  Empire his PropertyBut you say this is Injustice and that he in fact is an UsurperA  Fico  for Distinction of Names while he is in Possession of his Territories and at the Head of his Armies he is a PrinceI only wish I could be the  Kouli Kan  of the  Theatre  and the  Mobile  might give me whatever Name or Title they pleas'd besides to distinguish me byBut do not our  European  Potentates act on the same Principle If they can once gain Possession by Fraud or Force of a convenient Island or Tract of Land or Dominion do they not think they have a just Right to it and that it becomes their PropertyWould any good  Englishman  doubt our indisputable Right to  Gibraltar Minorca Jamaica  or  Hispaniola  and all the  American World  if we could take them from the  Spaniards  nd afterwards keep themIf therefore I either  Vi  or  Fraude  could get any Part of the theatric Dominions am I to blameOr if I the  young Captain  at Land meeting with a rich trading Taylor should plunder him of a laced Suit of Cloath  why am I to be censured more than another Captain at Sea who plunders a  Caracca  S  p  O but  says my Opponent  I supposethe publick Property of Nations and the private Property of Subjects are  differently  to be considered  I am your humb  e Servant for that my Dear By my Philosophy I look upon the State of Nature as a State of War all is sair Play in this Scramble for the Goods of the World  and I think myself in this Respect acting in as just Principle as any Potentate living  Why was not I the Twentieth by Descent  From a long restive Race of droaning Kings  Ye Gods why gave ye me a Monarch's Soul  And crusted it with base  Plebeian  Clay  Dryden's Spanish Fryar  What a BustleMaster General would I have made among the Princes of the World and elbow'd all the Monarchs round about meBut  non sic Dii voluere  Therefore in mimic Parallel among the Plumes of Tragedy and Struts of Ambition I shew a Dawn of what had I been a Prince I should have acted  But to return from this Digression on PropertyOur Hopes were frustrated as to forming a new Company by the Sanction of a License from the  Lord Chamberlain  and Mr  Colley Cibber  's Ambition and private Views have the same Fare as mineHe indeed may please himself with his Follies having a plentiful Provision for Life and still have the Joy he took in the End of an old Song  My Mind my Mind is a Kingdom to me  He like a loose Philosopher may again say  Me while my laughing Follies can deceive  Blest in the dear Delirium let me live  Rather than wisely know my Wants and grieve  But for my Part I must again submit to return to the Stage a Servant instead of a Manager which had I known some Weeks ago this Apology had not as yet have been wrote nor my Father's would not as yet have been publish'd But as I am drawn into this historical Narration of the Stage which is in fact a true and necessary Appendix to his I will make it as compleat as possible for which Reason I shall enter on another Chapter that I may give the theatrical Characters of the principal Actors now living not only as it will be in Mr  Colley Cibber  's Manner which I promis'd to follow in my Title Page but in fact as this Apology will not be  An Historical View of the  STAGE  during my  OWN TIME without them The drawing Characters is the most difficult Province of a Historian and very few either antient or modern have succeeded in them They who sneer at  Cibber  's  Apology  in general approve of his characterizing his Cotemporaries they own the Draught is masterly and the Colouring entertaining I am sensible therefore how hard the Task must be to give the Pourtrait of living Players when all the Town is acquainted with the Originals However as I am of a strong Opinion this Apology as well as the other may live to late Posterity I am not willing my  Cotemporaries  should be buried in Oblivion and perhaps there may be no  Apologist theatrical  hardy enough to succeed me My Friends of the Stage will therefore excuse my Manner Partiality and Expressions and what they may not approve as being too free pass over with a Smile of Contempt for to conclude I shall be as free with Mr  C Cibber  and  myself  as any of them whose Characters I shall draw up as Parallels to one another As I have given you Reader the Bill of Fare of the next Chapter it is in your own Option whether you will set down to the Meal  CHAP XI and Last  The several theatrical Characters of some of the present ActorsA Parallel between the  Author  and Mr  Colley Cibber  The Conclusion  _AS I am now entering on a Province which is esteem'd the most difficult for an Historian to succeed in I am under some Apprehensions that this Chapter may not only be the least entertaining but may give Offence when I have no Manner of Design that it should To draw Characters  requires not only a great Judgement but great Art tho' you describe Persons that have lived some Years or Centuries before you write But to draw the Characters of Persons living  Hic Labor hoc Opus est  Equally to avoid Flattery or Censure and to keep strictly to a judicious Narration is what few Historians have succeeded in at all but to characterize your Cotemporaries then living requires such an honest Impartiality that still sewer have attempted itOn these Considerations I would have wav'd giving any Characters of my theatrical Brethren but on the Remonstration of some Friends that my History would not be compleat without them I must in Part enter on this arduous Undertaking  Jacta est Alea  as  Caesar  said  The Die is castWe'll pass the  Rubicon Proceed I must and will therefore in the Conclusion of this prefatory Paragraph I shall chuse the Motto of another great Man  Fari que Sentiat  and so Mr  Reader  and Sir  Actor  I hope you will peruse the Rest of this History with Candour if my Pictures are such as you in Truth know them to be For as the  Gazetteer  says  "Most Writers seem to have it more in View to display their own Parts or make their Court to the Person characteriz'd to his Relations Friends and Dependants than to draw him truly such as he was and of many such it may be said as was said of the Painter who excell'd in Colouring and Proportion That his Pictures had every Excellence but  Likeness  "  It may be wonder'd why I quote this Author but I am willing to pay all Deference to an Author who has been engaged in the same Cause with myself and perhaps my  individual  SELF I only wish my Pictures may have some Likeness which will I believe a  tone for the Want of other Excellencies presuming this Attempt may be neither disagreable to the Curious or the Frequenters of a Theatre take it without any farther Preface  In the Year the principal Actors or whom I think the principal Actors may be thus impartially and concisely pourtray'd  As Tragedians claim from their costly Plumes and Trappings a Superiority of Merit over the Comedians I shall begin with them and taking the Liberty of deviating  from  Cicero Salust Clarendon  and all other Historians except  Colley Cibber  shall describe them just as I think proper  Qn  at  DruryLane  House and  Dlne  at  CoventGarden  are the  Personae Dramatis  which are without Competitors They both play the chief Characters in the same Cast therefore I shall consider their different Characters together  Qn  has been many Years on the Stage and has gradually rose up to that Height of Reputation he at present enjoys When  DruryLane  Theatre was under the Direction of the late Mr  Rich  he was in the inferior Class and the  Lieutenant  of the  Tower  in  Cibber  's Alteration of  Richard the Third  was one of the principal Parts he perform'd The Cast of several Plays in Print fully prove his Abilities were then thought but very insignificant however on a new Company setting up at  Lincoln'sInnFields  he was engag'd in it and has ever since but more especially on the Death of  Boheme  gradually rose to a great Degree of Favour with the Publick Mr  Booth  's quitting the Stage still set him in a fairer Light and indeed left him without a Rival He had for some Time appear'd without any Competitor when all on a sudden there appear'd at  Goodman'sFields  a young Tragedian from  Dublin  This was  D l ne  Novelty Youth a handsome Figure  c  took off from any severe Criticism on his Elocution and Action In short though so far from the polite End of the Town he drew to him several polite Audiences and became in such a Degree of Repute that Comparisons were made between him and  Qn  nor was he without Admirers of both Sexes who gave him the Preference He was not insensible of this and determin'd to leave  Goodman'sFields  and indulge his Ambition at one of the Theatres Royal  Q n  just at that Time left  CoventGarden  for  DruryLane  and he engag'd with Mr  Rich  at  CoventGarden  and in two or three Years on the Stage gain'd that Station on it which most of the other Actors could not in many Years attain to  Q n  has the Character of a just Speaker but then it is confin'd to the solemn declamatory Way He either cannot work himself into  the Emotions of a violent Passion or he will not take the Fatigue of doing it The Partiality of his Friends says he can touch the Passions with great Delicacy  if he will  but general Opinion affirms he has neither Power of Voice or Sensation to give Love or Pity Grief or Remorse their proper Tone and Variation of Features  D l ne  is also esteemed a just Player and though he has often a more loud Violence of Voice yet either from an Imitation of  Q n  or his own natural Manner he has a Sameness of Tone and Expression and drawls out his Lines to a displeasing Length But that loud Violence of Voice is useful to him when Anger Indignation or such enrag'd Passions are to be express'd for the shrill Loudness marks the Passion which the sweet Cadence of  Q n  's natural Voice is unequal to In such Parts especially  Alexander D l ne  pleases many for the Million as  C C  says are apt to be transported when the Drum of the Ear is soundly rattled But on the contrary  Q n  's solemn Sameness of Pronunciation which conveys an awful Dignity is charmingly affecting in  Caio D l ne  is young enough to rise to greater Perfection  Q n  may be said now to be at the Height of his If  D l ne  has the more pleasing Person  Q n  has he more affecting Action Both might soon appear with more Advantage if they were on the same Stage The Rivalship of  D l ne  would give a spirited Jealousy to  Q n  and force him to exert himself and  Q n  's Judgment would improve the unfinish'd Action of  D l ne  but they are the  Caesar  and  Pompey  of the Theatres and one Stage would be incompatible with their Ambition  Q n  could bear no one on the Footing as an Equal  D l ne  no one as a Superior  M lw d  is an Actor with all the Happiness of Voice that can be imagin'd and a Personage very well turn'd for the Lover or the Heroe nor when he is not indolently negligent does he often betray a Want of Judgment His Voice is sweet with an uncommon Strength and in the Decadence of it there is a Softness which adapts it to touch the Passions of Grief Love Pity or Despair In Comedy the Easiness of his Dialogue in the genteel Characters seems very amiable and though in  his Action and Speech he does not imitate that quick snipsnap Catch of the late Mr  Wilks  to express Spirit and Vigour yet his Voice and Gesture show such a Vivacity as are the just Effects of Nature In low Comedy he has been seen to succeed beyond Expectation and to speak all in a Word according to Mr  Cibber  's Description of  Mountford  he is or might be the true Representative of him  Of Mr  William M ls  I have said something in a preceding Chapter all I shall add here is that he is not excellent in Tragedy the Inanity of his Voice being unequal to the Swellings and Throws of the Sublime In Comedy he succeded to Mr  Wilks  's Parts has caught something of his Catch in the Voice is always very busy on the Stage and what all Actors ought to value themselves upon very perfect  Griffin  and  Joe Miller  being dead I shall give no Descriptions of them nor of those who have succeded to their Parts for if I should speak of their Excellencies I should be tempted to mention the comparative Inequality of their SuccessorsLike the great  Apologist  's Method of treating  Verbruggen Keen Boheme c c c  I shall pass over the Rest of the present Players as Princes of pett  Fame I shall therefore only speak of two Actresses and Myself and  Colley Cibber  in Parallel  Mrs  Cl e  is esteem'd by all an excellent Comic Actress and as she has a prodigious Fund of natural Spirit and Humour off the Stage she makes the most of the Poet's on it Nothing though ever so barren even though it exceeds the Limits of Nature can be  at in her Hands She heightens all Characters of Humour she attempts nor is she confined only to the  H  yden  Miss or pert Chambermaid but in spiritous gay Characters of high Life she always appears with such Air Mein and Action as speak the Gay the Lively and the Desirable She has been by Persons who remember both compared to Mrs  Mountsord  and by their natural Talents for the Stage I am apt to believe the Comparison not unjust I must however observe Mrs  Mountford  appear'd with great Success  en Cavalier  and made an adroit pretty Fellow Mrs  Cl e  does not  appear in these Characters the concealing Petticoat better suiting with her Turn of Make than the Breeches It is not from want of Spirit or Judgment to hit off the Fop or the Coxcomb as she has evidently prov'd in the Ballad she Sings call'd the  Life of a Beau  in which her Action and Gesture is as pleasing as in any Part she performs I could wish she would never attempt serious Characters in Comedy and to resign the Part of  Ophelia  in  Hamlet  in which she is very unequal to herselfYet all will allow that  take her all in all  she has such Talents as make her an excellent Actress  Though Mrs  Cl e  is by far the most excellent Actress of the  DruryLane  Company and to speak out the severe Judgment of experienc'd Criticks the only Actress who has any  Excellence  in it yet she has a Competitor in Fame at  CoventGarden  Mrs  H t n  stands in the same Degree of Superiority on this latter Stage as Mrs  Cl e  does on the former but I must observe that their Talents Manner Air Gesture and Cast of Parts are very different  Mrs  H t n  though past the  heyday  of her  Beauty  yet betrays so little decay of Youth that an  inexpressible Somewhat  in her Air Face and Mein throws out such a Glow of Health and Chearfulness that on the Stage few Spectators that are not past it can behold her without  Desire  and in the Fullness of my Heart I may venture to confess that the  Desirable  is so predominant in her that my Soul has a  Taste  or  Tendre  for Mrs  H t n  To speak critically of her as an Actress in all Parts of a gay Impertinent or the  Coquette  she has all the Female Foppery that a giddy lively fantastick Creature can be affected withThe Language Dress Motion and Manners of a  Millamant  seem naturally her own and I may say of her what the great  Apologist  said of Mrs  Bracegirdle  in that Part that  "  C Cibber  's Apology p  when she acts  Millamant  all the Faults Follies and Affectation of that agreeable Tyrant were venially melted down into so many Charms and Attractions of a conscious  Beauty"  But besides these Foibles of the Fair Sex she can rise into the decent Dignity of a fine Lady and charm with the innocent Reserve of an  Indiana  as by the fluttering  Je ne scai quoy  of a  Millamant  In Tragedy since the Death of Mrs  Hallam  she stands without any equal Competitor for she has that Grace in her Presence that clear Melody in her Voice with Strength enough to express the Violence of some Passions and Softness to subside into the Harmony of others that no Actress now performing on either Stage can in this Light be compared to herThere are some indeed at both Houses who  throw out some Proffers of a Genius  yet cannot be rank'd in any Degree of  Perfection  for either they heavily drag the Sentiment along with a longton'd Voice absent Eye and Inanity of Gesture or else with an impetuous Velocity of Voice staring Eye and unmeaning Superfluity of Action  make the Performance come out odly disguis'd or somewhere defectively unsurprising to the Hearer  As I mention no particular Persons no particular Persons can take Offence In Justice to my own Judgement I must acknowledge that I unwillingly acquiesce in the Observation of many Judges that the  two Theatres  never had at any Time so indifferent a Set of  Actresses  as at present and among the younger Actresses I have not seen one who has shewn the least Genius for the Stage which may ever make its Way towards Perfection It may seem a Matter of Wonder to some why they who have been excellent in a Theatre as  Cibber Wilks  and  Booth  did not bring up young Actors to succeed them and this was indeed objected to their Administration  "  C Cibber  's Apology p  And this says the  Apologist  was a Matter as easy as planting so many Cabbages"  True it is indeed good Actors and good Cabbages are not with equal Plenty produced However if there is a  natural Materia  in the  Actor  as there is in the  Cabbage  I can see no Reason why he should not sprout as well as the Cabbage Indeed he will afterwards require some Care  to bring him to Perfection so does the Cabbage  This  cannot do without the enlivening Warmth of the Sun and the  young Actor  requires to be chear'd by such little Parts as may gain him some little Applause for  C Cibber  's Apology p  Publick Approbation is the warm Weather of a theatrical Plant  But it seems this would be too much Trouble for our theatrical Gardiners they were not for turning  Nursery Men  of dramatick Cabbages but to have bought them at Market for says the  metaphorical Apologist  "  Ditto  p  Let it be our Excuse then for that mistaken Charge against us that since there was no Garden or Market where accomplish'd Actors grew or were to be sold we could only pick them up by Chance"  As for myself I was a young  Sprout  from so admirable a  Stem  that Nature threw out in me several Perfections which I may rather call hereditary than acquired and whether I am considered in a theatrical poetical political or moral Capacity the Reader will observe through the Course of this History there is some Truth in my Motto  Scquiturque Patrem  Though through Modesty I am forc'd to add  non passibus Aequis  which give me Leave to render into a paraphrastick Couplet  His Father's Steps he follows to be great  But not with equal Pace or equal Fate  Some future Historian may thus write of us The Father indeed had more of the  Sal Atticum  in his Genius but then the Son excell'd him in an open hardy Confidence of Behaviour COLLEY'S Conduct in Life was more on the Reserve than THE'S but by THE'S making a Bustle in the World he shew'd a superior Greatness of Soul COLLEY had the cool Calmness of a designing Courtier THE' the frank rash Spirit of a  young Captain  The  Father  was the greater  Hypocrite  the  Son  was the greater  Madman  COLLEY render'd himself remarkable by his  Fopperies  THE' by his  Extravagancies  Yet their private Virtues publick Modesty and Sentiments of Morality were in fact in the  one and the other the same though their publick Conduct was extremely differentCOLLEY had rather  be  immoral than be esteem'd so THE' thought it more Glory the more he acquir'd the Character of being soThe Reputation of the one was only founded on private Rumour but that of the other is on publick Record In short the  Father  had few Equals the  Son  not  one  Having brought the History of the Stage down from the Time my Father left it to the present Vacation I can only add after my Exploits Hopes and Ambition I must return to Mr  Rich  as an hired Actor and wait in dudgeon some more favourable Opportunity to make my Attempts on the theatric Dominions more successful However those Attempts occasion'd this Apology which will transmit my Name and Character to late Posterity and I may conclude as  Ovid  does  Jamque opus exegi quod nee Jovis Ira nec Ignes  Terram nec poterit nee Edax ab  lere Vetustas  c  And now I've done a Work which neither  JOVE  Ner all his Wrath nor Thunderbolts above  Nor ruthful Steel nor alldevouring Time  Shall e'er destroy this  History sublime  FINIS  ERRATUM  I  P  ge  for  Li  ionst  read  Es  court
