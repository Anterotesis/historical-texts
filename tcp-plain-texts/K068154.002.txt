 DIBDIN'S SELECTED SONGS  A COLLECTION OF  SONGS  SELECTED FROM THE WORKS OF Mr DIBDIN  IF TO BE MERRY'S TO BE WISE TO BE WISE IS TO BE MERRY  VOLUME II  LONDON PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR AND SOLD BY HIM AT HIS WAREHOUSE NO STRAND OPPOSITE THE ADELPHI  PREFACE  I CANNOT resist the inclination this opportunity gives me of noticing how sincerely I rejoice that the tongue of malignity which has so opened against me on the subject of these songs is likely to be completely silenced  Let it however be understood that for any private uneasiness the saucy slander ever gave me for any fear I entertained lest it should depreciate me in the opinion of the judicious and the worthy for any personal enmity I feel towards the miserable fools who are punished enough by the gnawings of their own rancourfor any of these or similar considerations I should have suffered the noisome snuff to linger till it became choaked in its own fetid dregs but it has annoyed the public and therefore it is my duty to put on the extinguisher  The history of this business is very simple and selfevident I started in life with some popularity and therefore became an object of envy Those who were galled at my success endeavoured to crush me They knew they could not do so honestly and therefore they attempted it by villany Public indignation however so astonished the reptiles that they were glad to slink into their filthy lurking places for safety  From that time onward till within these three yearsbeing connected with managers and musicshops and working for mere hireI lived pretty free from calumny Throwing off every kind of yoke however and standing upon my own foundationat which time I pledged myself that my productions should not even in the minutest degree receive assistance from either manager author or composerthe vipers began again to rear their heads and manyto the reproach of manhood and the dishonour of human natureare the wanton and wicked proofs that they are only scotehed not killed  This will be clearly evident if we notice that the medium through which they have attempted to emit their poison is a revival of the same slander which was originally levelled against my reputation and which only shews that they have more wickedness than cunning They fancy that could they induce a general belief that I imposed upon the world the productions of some other person as my own I should be held as a man void of faith or honour but what proper indignation must fill every heart if it could be brought home to conviction that the principles of this person of whom I am supposed to be merely the agent are detested and his memory execrated  Could this be maintained it would cut two ways It would hold me up both professionally and morally as an impostor and stimulate the public not only to damn my works but my character Poor shallowsighted idiots They indeed know nothing of the nature of public generosity They have never experienced that it constantly follows laudable industry that it ever encourages those endeavours which aim at conveying reasonable pleasure and useful instrucsion  and that whom it protects it raises far above the reach of malice or detraction They only know fallen as they are that it is a bliss they dare not hope to enjoy because they are unworthy to possess it  Having spoken of managers and musicshops it may not be improper to notice that in separating myself from public connections I am not actuated by any thing captious or capricious I have no wish to cavil at men who have made bargains with me to their advantage I cannot blame them for taking care of their interest nor do I believe they blame me for taking care of mine but on the contraryparticularly those with whom I have been most connectedwish well to my pursuits and would lend my exertions every advantage in their power Nor is there any thing wonderful in this for it is a poor compliment to human integrity to suppose that it is not very natural in us to assist those from whom we have received assistance  Putting out of the question the rascality of my slanderers I shall next examine whether there is anything  like probability in their slander premising that I should not have condescended so far but for the only circumstance in all this business that gives me any thing like pain and it is that many men of strict honour and cordial good wishes towards me have even in my presence apparently given into something like a belief of what has been urged against me  Such a leaven is there in the composition of man and so captivating is a novel opinion that I am afraid should there be any malignity in it there are very few who may not under particular circumstances suffer a momentary suspension of their integrity to indulge an absurd curiosity I declare I have had such questions asked me by even kind and worthy friends that had I not known an anxious solicitude had for an instant obscured probability and outran reflection I must for the sake of my honour have spit in their faces  Nor is this language too strong In what way can the best friend make me amends for having indulgel even for a single moment a belief that I am  the wretch these execrable villains would fain describe me But my only revenge on those who have been thus betrayed from their duty as men and tricked out of their charity as christians shall be to shew upon how unsubstantial a foundation they have grounded their belief  To go into this examination then What is there in all we know of Mr BICKERSTAFF to give the faintest colour to probability that he has written my songs and that I always have been and now am his intimate friend Is it because whatever he has written and whatever I have written are of a totally different complexion Does he write my sea songs because those in his  Thomas and Sally  are taken technically the absurdest nonsense that ever disgraced paper Does the spirit of my poetry bear the characteristic of his because his was study and mine is intuition Because he was timid and I am bold Because what I write is temporary and for the moment when he was the tardiest and most tedious of all writers Did he or could he write any thing but songs Do I write any thing but ballads Have  I not uniformly rejected all assistancenay the assistance of much better poets than heand did he not court assistance from any body who would lend it him Were not the suggestions of GOLDSMITH KELLY GARRICK nay even SHUTER and many others caught at by him with avidity  But did not these plain and selfevident facts laugh the assertion to scorn is it likely that a man as he was of the most offensive and insufferable vanity who never allowed the smallest spark of merit to his friendsno not even in the moment they were lending advantage to his productionsis it probable that such a man notwithstanding the merited obloquy a discerning and virtuous public has properly heaped on his head would not manifest in some way his title to a share in my popularity Or to take it the other way what strange inconsistency or what singular atrocity has so marked my public career as to make me appear on one side such a fool and on the other such a knave as to risk being first discovered and afterwards betrayed by the man of all others the most capable of such conduct  Again what are the fascinating qualities in Mr BICKERSTAFF that should induce me to imitate him as a man and risk public benevolence for private infamy Am I impelled by gratitude in return for his driving hard bargains with me of his taking advantage of my inexperience and rewarding me with a trifle for labours by which he got large sums of money for being continually unfaithful to his engagements or for running away in my debt Am I enamoured of that insincerity for which he was remarkable and notoriousfor that profligacy and immorality which characterised his opinionsfor that supercilious hauteur through which he would affront his friendsor the pusillanimity which terrified him into begging their pardon The climax of this paragraph I will not stain my paper with My heart does not tell me that any single dispassionate man upon earth will accuse me of an inclination to emulate the above qualities and I flatter myself I shall not easily be suspected of preeminence in iniquity And now let my calumniaters with their usual truth and consistency assert that this is a panegyric on Mr BICKERSTAFF and that he wrote it  But this dare not now be ventured The public indignation is once more roused and woe to those who have provoked it My cause is become the cause of every honest man in the kingdom Every man's honour every man's character and every man's interest is involved in it It is not now a question whether in common with hundreds of high distinction brilliant talents and unspotted honour I shall with indifference and contempt see the lie of the day levelled at me but it is a question whether as an innocent man I shall be protected by society or as a perjurer driven from it  This slander became at length so rank so shameless and was so universally diffused that in justice to myself as a man and a citizen I have appealed to the laws of my country Disdaining to proceed otherwise than by indictment I have been granted a rule to shew cause why an information should not be filed against the person who has thought proper to libel me and to obtain that rule I have sworn  "that I have not at any time seen Mr BICKERSTAFF nor had any  correspondence with him since he absconded and that I know not whether he be alive or dead"  The matter is therefore now brought to a most serious and solemn point My reputation is in the hands of the public and every man of virtue and honour must pronounce for me that no one but an unprincipled villain will hereafter dare to mention my name coupled with any insinuation of the nature I complain of unless he shall not only accuse me but convict me of perjury  I have written this preface at the solicitation and for the satisfaction of those many friends whose warm and kind anxiety shall be remembered by me while my heart feels that gratitude which is its sweetest and dearest sensation In the course of it I have carefully studied not to anticipate nor prejudge any thing before the court I have only given an unqualified contradiction of what has been alledged against me and maintained my position by such probable circumstances as suggested themselves This it was particularly my duty  to do on bringing out these songs but I have not presumed to teach or dictate The subject is open to liberal discussion It is here at issue as well as at the King'sbench and I am neither ashamed nor afraid of what may be the decision in either place  DIBDIN's  SELECTED SONGS  BALLAD  IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT  I vow I thought you at first sight  A moppet a baboon a fright  Or some hobgoblin of the night  That guilty creatures waken  With nose and chin like ram's horns curl'd  And brows in furrowed wrinkles furl'd  Well 'tis amazing in this world  How one may be mistaken  II  For now I see with half an eye  You are not old nor made awry  Nor do your shambling trotters ply  As if by palsy shaken  You're young as Ganemede and fair  Narcissus had not such an air  Well 'tis amazing I declare  How one may be mistaken  BALLAD  Once on a time to mighty Jove  Complaints came from afar  From men of unsuccessful love  Miscarriages in war  In law the want of equity  Of mirth at city feasts  Of pathos in their poetry  And of good works in priests  II  So loud and clam'rous were these clods  That Jove ne'er left at rest  Conven'd a synod of the gods  And Bacchus 'mongst the rest  He merry wag knew what on earth  Thus caus'd them to repine  And instant sent them genuine mirth  Cask'd up in tons of wine  III  The lover drank and eas'd his care  Heroes grew high in fame  A comely paunch mark'd each Lord Mayor  And lawyers just became  Bards sung divine priests put up prayers  For such a blessing given  And Bacchus to this day declares  There's no such drink in heaven  BALLAD  WHEN last in the Dreadful your honour set sail  On Newfoundland banks there came on a hard gale  There was thunder red lightning and cold whistling hail  Enough the old gemman to scare  One who threaten'd your life dash'd below by a wave  Your own hand I saw snatch from a watery grave  And you said 'twas well done for that still with the brave  The noblest of glory's to spare  II  When yard arm and yard arm long side of a foe  When the blood from the scuppers rain'd on us below  When crippled enough to be taken in tow  To strike we saw mounseer prepare  If a broadside below or a volley above  The men were all ready to give her for love  How oft has your honour cry'd not a hand move  A hero's true glory's to spare  SONG  FAR from strife and love's alarms  With joyous heart and mind at ease  Time was when with resistless charms  Bacchus knew the way to please  When while the merry glee went round  Gaily I saw each minute pass  Nor ever had I heard a sound  Like the sweet tinkling of the glass  My flask now broke and spilt my wine  For Cupid Bacchus' joys I quit  The myrtle kills the blighted vine  And love turn'd fate cries out submit  BALLAD  I went to sea with heavy heart  Of her I lov'd the scorn  Yet from my thoughts did ne'er depart  Her image night or morn  Storms lour'd waves roll'd and lightning flew  Yet did I wish to live  Still willing for my poor heart was true  To forget and to forgive  II  The first word when on English ground  I spoke was her false name  And soon upon enquiry found  For scandal fliesher shame  She lov'd a youth before the wind  Who cut and let her drive  Avast cried I 'twere now too kind  To forget and to forgive  III  While of these thoughts my mind was full  While adverse hopes and fears  Like winds did this and that way pull  She came to me in tears  Down went my colours and I swore  For her alone I'd live  Kiss'd her and promis'd o'er and o'er  To forget and to forgive  BALLAD  THE boatswain calls the wind is fair  The anchor heaving  Our sweethearts leaving  We to duty must repair  Where our stations well we know  Cast off halliards from the cleets  Stand by well clear all the sheets  Come my boys  Your handspikes poise  And give one general huzza  Yet sighing as you pull away  For the tears ashore that flow  To the windlass let us go  With yo heave ho  II  The anchor coming now apeak  Lest the ship striving  Be on it driving  That we the tap'ring yards must seek  And back the foretopsail well we know  A pleasing duty from aloft  We faintly see those charms where oft  When returning  With passion burning  We fondly gaze those eyes that seem  In parting with big tears to stream  But come lest ours as fast should flow  To the windlass once more go  With yo heave ho  III  Now the ship is under weigh  The breeze so willing  The canvass filling  The prest triangle cracks the stay  So taught to haul the sheet we know  And now in trim we gaily sail  The massy beam receives the gale  While freed from duty  To his beauty  Left on the less'ning shore afar  A fervent sigh heaves every tar  To thank those tears for him that flow  That from his true love he should go  With yo heave ho  BALLAD  IN THE LONG ODDS  AND did you hear what sad distaster  Poor Peg of Mapledown befel  For love that stoutest hearts can master  Alas that those who love so well  In sorrow's train  Should mourn in vain  Her story does such grief impel  That woe is me the while I tell  II  She loved a youth of honest kindred  At church behold the happy pair  And ask what 'twas their bliss that hindred  For he was young and she was fair  Accurs'd be wars  And party jars  Why must the handsome danger share  Alas it fills me with despair  III  Onward to his liege lord's dwelling  A rebel rout had cut their way  What shrieks ensued and what a yelling  For he a true man must away  He swore the fight  Would end ere night  And he'd return with garlands gay  Sweet trophies for his wedding day  IV  Night came and saw the youth returning  Accursed be war's destructive knife  She ran to clasp with passion burning  Her wedded lorddeprived of life  Oh cruel spight  What not one night  Is not her tale with misery rife  At once a maiden and a wife  BALLAD  IN THE LONG ODDS  A sailor and an honest heart  Like ship and helm are ne'er apart  For how should one stem wind and tide  If tother should refuse to guide  With that she freely cuts the waves  And so the tar  When clashing waves around him jar  Consults his heart and dangers braves  Where duty calls nor asks for more  Than grog aboard and girl ashore  II  'Tis not a thousand leagues from home  More horrid that the billows foam  'Tis not that gentler is the breeze  In channel than in distant seas  Danger surrounds him far and near  But honest tar  Though winds and water round him jar  Consults his heart and scorns to fear  The risks he runs endears him more  To grog on board and girl ashore  III  'Tis not that in the hottest fight  The murd'rous ball will sooner light  On that than any other spot  To face the cannon is his lot  He must of danger have his share  But honest tar  Though fire and winds and water jar  Consults his heart and shakes off care  And when the battle's heat is o'er  In grog aboard drinks girl ashore  BALLAD  IN HARVEST HOME  WOUNDS here's such a coil I am none of your poor  Petty varlets who flatter and cringe and procure  I'm a freeman a nabob a king on his throne  For I've chattles and goods and strong beer of my own  Besides 'tis a rule that good fellows ne'er fail  To let any thing wait but the generous ale  II  My interest I love thee I love too good wife  But still I love better a jovial life  And for thee or my lady with duty devout  I'll run to Old Nick when the dobbin's drank out  But 'tis always a rule that good fellows ne'er fail  To let any thing wait but the generous ale  BALLAD  IN HARVEST HOME  Arrah Pat did you leave your poor Unah to mourn  Fait and troth my dear jewel  Now was it not cruel  Oh come back again or you'll never return  To chear me when I'm broken hearted  Straight forward I look when around me so gay  I'd a pleasure in toiling  While Patrick was smiling  The sun snined though 'twas cloudy the while we made hay  For den Pat and I had not parted  II  Each bird while it's singing may shut up its throat  I won't look at the thistle  Where goldfinches whistle  For though they all shun me I don't hear a note  How can I while thus broken hearted  The cows may courant it the sheep frisk and play  Lambs and kidlings be dancing  And skipping and prancing  For though they're before me they're all gone away  Since Patrick and Unah are parted  SONG  IN HARVEST HOME  AWAY pale fear and ghastly terror  Fly at a parent's voice away  Correcting every youthful error  She deigns to bid and I obey  And oh my heart thou murmur'st treason  Perturb'd and frighten'd thus to move  This sacrifice I make to reason  Lie still poor flutt'rer and approve  BALLAD  IN HARVEST HOME  THOUGH I am humble mean and poor  Yet faith am I disarning  And one may see the sun shine sure  Without the help of learning  This little maxim for my sake  I pray you be believing  The truest pleasures that we take  Are those that we are giving  II  Is there a wretch with all his pelf  So poor as a rich miser  Sure does not he defraud himself  No maxim can be wiser  He who is blest for his own sake  Fait is himself deceiving  The truest pleasures that we take  Are those that we are giving  BALLAD  IN THE ISLANDERS  TRULY friend Gil thou choosest well  Taking a helpmate homely  For often times sad tales they tell  Of wives who are too comely  But cheer thee Perez and be gay  From furnished brows exempted  For how can she e'er go astray  Who never will be tempted  II  For thieves do never rob the poor  A pebble's not a jewel  Fruits do not blossom on a moor  Fire burns not without fuel  Up with thy heart then Gil be gay  From furnished brows exempted  Thy wife can never go astray  For she will ne'er be tempted  BALLAD  IN THE ISLANDERS  AH let not an instant of life pass in vain  The moments escape us and age brings on pain  Life's too precious too fugitive joy  The flowers which yesterday Zephyr disclosed  Droop'd their head on their stalks before Phoebus repos'd  Thus one single day serves to form and destroy  II  Then think not of ought but the moment that flies  To learn to be happy's to learn to be wise  Seize pleasure while pleasure's our own  Fear nothing thou'rt mine 'tis allotted above  Chance but obeyed fate and blest with thy love  I envy no king on his throne  BALLAD  IN THE ISLANDERS  THIS life's a day's journey we rise in the morn  The sun trees and flowers our prospect adorn  When perhaps we have scarcely been set out an hour  But slap we're o'ertaken and soused in a shower  To shelter then quickly and see now 'tis o'er  And in pretty good spirits we set out once more  Now up hill now down now even and now  We are cover'd with dust and now popp'd in a slough  II  Thus we jog on till dinner now wet and now dry  And now we've a low'ring and now a clear sky  With the fire the good landlord the wine and the cheer  Now refresh'd we set forward to end our career  But the roads are uneven we trip are bemired  And jolted and jostled and tumbled and tired  Yet we keep a good heart and our spirits are light  In hopes we shall meet with a good inn at night  BALLAD  FORGIVE me if thus I presuming  Come hither your heart to surprise  Smile smile and my hopes reillumine  But my pardon I read in your eyes  No impostor the passion I own is  And heaven what delight could I be  As truly to you an Adonis  As you are a Venus to me  II  The gods who so often delighted  In borrowed forms some fair nymph to pursue  Might confess they were never excited  By an object so charming as you  No impostor c  BALLAD  Our Jupiter has near his throne  Two vessels which he fills  The one with benefits alone  The other crams with ills  From the good vessel health content  Plenty and bliss he gives  While from the evil forth are sent  Gout stone and scolding wives  II  Thus to mankind with heedful care  In just proportion weighed  The lot to each each best can bear  By Jove's decree's conveyed  Unless his patience when to rub  Juno the devil drives  Then headlong from the left hand tub  Go troops of scolding wives  III  Oft this complaint on me like air  From men still passed away  Till that same type of Juno there  Let loose her tongue to day  But now entreating Jove I'll go  To chequer not their lives  With any other spot of woe  Who're plagued with scolding wives  BALLAD  IN THE ODDITIES  CELIA's an angel by her face  The rose and lily's shamed  The tresses of love's queen for grace  With her's can ne'er be named  The gods cried one that face with care  Formed in their best of humours  What pity 'tis both face and hair  Were bought at the perfumer's  II  Celia has sworn to love till death  For words so full of bliss  I could have longed but for her breath  To steal an ardent kiss  Rapture itself is poor and cold  To joy that she discovers  What pity she the same has told  To fifty other lovers  III  Celia is young behold her mein  Alert from top to toe  My aunt says she was just fifteen  Some thirty years ago  Thus youth and beauty's best delights  Sweet Celia are adorning  For she a Venus is at nights  A sybil in the morning  BALLAD  THE wind blew hard the sea ran high  The dingy scud drove cross the sky  All was safe lashed the bowl was slung  When careless thus Ned Haulyard sung  A sailor's life's the life for me  He takes his duty merrily  If winds can whistle he can sing  Still faithful to his friend and king  He gets belov'd by all the ship  And toasts his girl and drinks his flip  II  Down topsails boys the gale comes on  To strike topgallant yards they run  And now to hand the sail prepared  Ned cheerful sings upon the yard  A sailor's life c  III  A leak a leakcome lads be bold  There's five foot water in the hold  Eager on deck see Haulyard jump  And hark while working at the pump  A sailor's life c  IV  And see the vessel nought can save  She strikes and finds a wat'ry grave  Yet Ned preserved with a few more  Sings as he treads a foreign shore  A sailor's life c  V  And nowunnumbered perils past  On land as well as seaat last  In tatters to his Poll and home  See honest Haulyard singing come  A sailor's life c  VI  Yet for poor Haulyard what disgrace  Poll swears she never saw his face  He damns her for a faithless she  And singing goes again to sea  A sailor's life c  WELCH BALLAD  I pray when your sweetheart pouts  And fleers and flouts  And glours and glouts  Ne'er mind the pursing of her prow  But pout again I pray you now  Is it not true that females fex  Plague and perplex  The other sex  With whimsies in their heads that grow  And fantisies I pray you now  II  Rack poor men's powels prains and hearts  Do not their arts  And whims and starts  Plue tiffles in their heads that crow  And jealousies I pray you now  Then mind not nonsense of the fair  But change your air  And shake off care  Nor to their tricks and fancies pow  But let them ko I pray you now  BALLAD  IF my hearty you'd not like a lubber appear  You must very well know how to hand reef and steer  Yet a better manoeuvre 'mongst seamen is found  'Tis the tight little maxim to know how to sound  Which a sailor can tell from a bay to a shoal  But the best sort of sounding is sounding the bowl  II  I've sounded at land and I've sounded at sea  I've sounded aweather and sounded alee  I've sounded my quine at the randivoo house  And I've sounded my pouch without finding a souse  What then we've a brother in each honest soul  And sailors can ne'er want for sounding the bowl  III  All men try for soundings wherever they steer  Your nabobs for soundings strive hard in Cape Clear  And there is not a soul from the devil to the pope  That could live but for sounding the Cape of Good Hope  No fear then nor danger our hearts shall controul  Though at sea we're in soundings while sounding the bowl  BALLAD  In which of all thy various joys  The tongue of fame that so employs  Didst thou best tastesay mighty Jove  The pure unmixed delights of love  Not with Europathere recourse  Thou boldly had'st to brutal force  Her wishes took with thee no part  She gave her person not her heart  II  Not with the beauteous Theban dame  When thou assumedest her husband's name  For though ingenious was the whim  She knew not thee but thought of him  Not then when in a glitt'ring shower  Thou visit'st Danae in the tower  The gold prevailed 'tis true and she  Yielded to interest not to thee  III  Nor Semele whom to obey  Thou cam'st in terrible array  She proud one yielded not to love  But to ambition and to Jove  No 'twas Mnenosyne sweet fair  Thy joys indeed were perfect there  Joys hadst thou not no bard had sung  For thence the immortal sisters sprung  BALLAD  LIKE a very gallant will I compliment all  I must leer at and ogle the pretty  Tell the short ones they're neat and majestic the tall  And call all the homely ones witty  Thus agreeable falsehood still passing for truth  I shall tickle their vanity snugly  Talk of prudence to age and of pleasure to youth  And console with a fortune the ugly  II  To the pale I'll on delicate lilies begin  To the florid I'll hold forth on roses  Call squinting a leer find a smile in a grin  And proportion where chins kiss with noses  Thus agreeable falsehood still passing for truth  I'll their vanity tickle so snugly  That I'll please tall and short fat and lean ageand youth  And reconcile even the ugly  BALLAD  IF tars of their money are lavish  I say brother take this wipe from me  'Tis because we're not muckworms nor slavish  Like lubbers who ne'er go to sea  What's cunning and such quivication  And them sly manoeuvres to we  To be roguish is no valuation  To hearties who plough the salt sea  II  As for cheatinglight weights and short measures  And corruption and bribery d'ye see  These never embitter the pleasures  Of good fellows who plough the salt sea  You've ashore actions writs cesseraries  And a regiment of counsel to fee  Jack knows not of such like vagaries  We never trust lawyers at sea  III  'Tis said that with grog and our lasses  Because jolly sailors are free  That money we squander like asses  Which like horses we earn'd when at sea  But let them say this that or tother  In one thing they're forced to agree  Honest hearts find a friend and a brother  In each worthy that ploughs the salt sea  GLEE  WOULD ye know where freedom dwells  Where jovial hearts carouse and sing  Haunt these grots explore these cells  Here every subject is a king  Sprightly mirth inhabits here  And joy that knows no listless pause  For how should we dull sorrow fear  Who square our lives by pleasure's laws  What's fortuneis it chance or worth  Peasant and prince their race must run  Nor is there that poor spot on earth  But's cherished by the genial sun  BALLAD  IN THE ISLANDERS  An infant defenceless of succour bereft  On this rude barren wild was I thrown  My sole ray of comfort I had not been left  To brood o'er my sorrows alone  To see cataracts falling and hear lions roar  Or the awful loud war on the deep  Is the fate poor Flametta was born to deplore  Which she oft would wish kinder and weep  II  To all this assemblage of horrors enured  What yet greater ills could one prove  Could one think for a heart which had so much endured  Fate should store up a torment like love  'Tis too much I've decided and who shall relate  When her and her miseries sleep  The tale of Flametta will sure wish her fate  Poor wretch had been kinder and weep  BALLAD  DEVOTED to Celia and blest in her arms  How I thrill'd with delight as I ran o'er her charms  When methought on each grace as I gaz'd with surprise  For preeminence pleaded her mouth and her eyes  Like counsel this opened and tother replied  Appealing to me as a judge to decide  II  Her mouth opening sweetly thus said with a smile  ' 'Tis I who the torments of lovers beguile  ' I can speak I can sing I can vent the fond sigh  ' And vain may eyes promise if I should deny  ' Then while rows of pearls vermeil lips sweetly hide  ' On our different charms 'twere not hard to decide'  III  With ineffable sweetness while looking me through  Her eyes careless cried'Why I can speak too  ' And in such charming language so made to controul  ' That of sensible lovers it goes to the soul  ' Mouths may fib but while eyes to the heart are the guide  ' Twere no difficult task on our charms to decide'  VI  Transported with rapture I cried with an oath  ' Charming eyes charming mouth I'm in love with you both  ' To express your sweet influence no language has terms  ' One makes me a promise which tother confirms  ' Your words and your looks are my joy and my pride  ' On your different claims then how can I decide'  BALLAD  To a slight common wound it is some diminution  Diverting its throbbing to smile at the smart  But where's the firm mind can boast such resolution  In the face to wear smiles when the wound's in the heart  The wand'rings and errors of folly are treason  And should be condemned as disloyal to love  But reverence is due to the errors of reason  Which though they're a weakness we're forced to approve  III  Then pray cease to jest were my griefs superficial  Unconcerned like yourself Sir I merry might be  But such cruel jests can but prove prejudicial  And though pastime to you may be mortal to me  Yet let me not wrong you by any rude mention  Or word that the fairness of candour might blot  But gratefully just may alone the intention  In my memory be cherished the action forgot  BALLAD  Curs'd be the sordid wretch of yore  Who from the bowels of the earth  First drew crude heaps of shining ore  Stamp'd the rude mass and gave it worth  Ere yet distinctions and degrees  In lovers' wishes bore a part  Truly to love was then to please  And heart was made the price of heart  II  Henceforth ye lovers nothing hope  Your fire is dead your ardour cold  Love has no influence power or scope  But that which it derives from gold  Long may ye languish long expect  Vows lavishwishes sighs employ  A brittle temple to erect  Which gold can in an hour destroy  BALLAD  Propitious gods that rule our fate  Whose ears are tired with idle prayers  To banish ills that men create  And chase imaginary cares  And first they ask in rank and power  A fate from every care exempt  Vain hopeambition lasts its hour  Then dwindles into just contempt  II  Next reputation in the field  Renown and to be great in story  I all such horrid honours yield  No brother's blood shall buy my glory  A sumptuous palace gorgeous board  A train of followers next they crave  Poor fools his guests retir'd the lord  Is but a solitary slave  III  Next to their memories they'd erect  A statue lasting fame to give  I ask but reason and expect  My little pleasures while I live  Happy in honours power wealth  If you but grant my fond desire  A blameless heart unshaken health  My friends my bottle and my lyre  BALLAD  SUCH love as holy hermits bear  The shrine where they put up their prayer  As love the feather'd race the air  Or sportive fish the sea  Such as in breasts of Seraphs spring  When on the expanse of heaven they wing  To greet that power by whom they sing  Such love I bear to thee  II  Such thankful love as warm must glow  In those who sunk in night and snow  When welcome beams first faintly shew  The longlost sun they see  As pleasure youth

Robin Hood  The damsel as handsome as handsome can be  Who has many a pound and plenty of geer  Than whose father no lord ever kept better cheer  Who now goes to marry a mate of high blood  And all out of spight to this bold Robin Hood  Tadderer too tadderer tee tadderer radderer tandoree  II  This Robin as shall be related anon  With brave William Scarlet and bold Little John  All outlaws as daring as daring can be  Makes this wideskirted forest betimes in the morn  Resound far and near with the bugle horn  When straight out of fear all that live near the wood  Run and lock up their daughters from bold Robin Hood  Tadderer too c  III  How this Robin full fifty bold foresters slew  How the pindar of Wakefield made one of his crew  As desperate a crew as desperate can be  How the butcher he trick'd bid the bold tinker stand  Made the bishop say mass and fought Arther of Bland  Are wrote and set down in true language and good  In the life and adventures of bold Robin Hood  Tadderer too c  IV  But the best joke of all is the comical tale  How he rescued the sweetheart of Allen a Dale  An action as daring as daring can be  It happened her parents would force her to church  With intention poor Allen to leave in the lurch  When twenty stout fellows all firm men and good  Rush'd in and were headed by bold Robin Hood  Tadderer too c  V  But to come to Clorinda and finish my tale  The second edition of Allen a Dale  With us he'd fain play but too cunning are we  Him John and his Scarlet we all laugh to scorn  His merry men all and his bugle horn  Let him come then he'll find us all stout men and good  Fit to drub all such outlaws as bold Robin Hood  Tadderer too c  BALLAD  Give round the word dismount dismount  While echoed by the sprightly horn  The toils and pleasures we recount  Of this sweet health inspiring morn  'Twas glorious sport none e'er did lag  Nor drew amiss nor made a stand  But all as firmly kept their pace  As had Acteon been the stag  And we had hunted by command  Of the goddess of the chase  II  The hounds were out and snuffed the air  And scarce had reach'd th' appointed spot  But pleas'd they heard a layer a layer  And presently drew on the slot  Twas glorious sport c  III  And now o'er yonder plain he fleets  The deepmouth'd hounds begin to bawl  And echo note for note repeats  While sprightly horns resound a call  Twas glorious sport c  IV  And now the stag has lost his pace  And while warhauneh the huntsman cries  His bosom swells tears wet his face  He pants he struggles and he dies  'Twas glorious sport c  BALLAD  IN THE WAGS  WOULD you hear a sad story of woe  That tears from a stone might provoke  'Tis concerning a tar you must know  As honest as e'er biscuit broke  His name was Ben Block of all men  The most true the most kind the most brave  But harsh treated by fortune for Ben  In his prime found a watery grave  II  His place no one ever knew more  His heart was all kindness and love  Though on duty an eagle he'd soar  His nature had most of the dove  He lov'd a fair maiden named Kate  His father to interest a slave  Sent him far from his love where hard fate  Plunged him deep in a watery grave  III  A curse on all slanderous tongues  A false friend his mild nature abused  And sweet Kate of the vilest of wrongs  To poison Ben's pleasure accused  That she never had truly been kind  That false were the tokens she gave  That she scorn'd him and wish'd he might find  In the ocean a watery grave  IV  Too sure from this cankerous elf  The venom accomplished its end  Ben all truth all honour himself  Suspected no fraud in his friend  On the yard while suspended in air  A loose to his sorrows he gave  Take thy wish he cried false cruel fair  And plung'd in a watery grave  BALLAD  IN THE WAGS  To ask would you come for to go  How a truehearted tar you'd discern  He's as honest a fellow I'd have you to know  As e'er stept between stem and stern  Let furious winds the vessel waft  In his station amidships or sore or aft  He can pull away  Cast off belay  Aloft alow  Avast yo ho  And hand reef and steer  Know each halliard and jeer  And of duty every rig  But his joy and delight  Is on Saturday night  A drop of the creature to swig  II  The first voyage I made to sea  One day as I hove the lead  The main top gallant mast went by the lee  For it blew off the devil's head  Tumble up there bear a hand turn to  While I the foremost of the crew  Soon could pull away  Cast off belay  Aloft alow  Avast yo ho  And hand reef and steer  Know each halliard and jeer  And of duty every rig  But my joy and delight  Was on Saturday night  A drop of the creature to swig  III  There was Kit with a cast in his eye  And Tom with the timber toe  And shambling Will for he hobbled awry  All wounded a fighting the foe  Three lads though crazy grown and crank  As true as ever bumbo drank  For they'd pull away  Cast off belay  Aloft alow  Avast yo ho  And hand reef and steer  Know each halliard and jeer  And of duty every rig  But their joy and delight  Was on Saturday night  A drop of the creature to swig  IV  Then over life's ocean I'll jog  Let the storm or the Spaniards come on  So but sea room I get and a skin full of grog  I fear neither devil nor don  For I'm the man that's spract and daft  In my station amidships or fore or aft  I can pull away  Cast off belay  Aloft alow  Avast yo ho  And hand reef and steer  Know each halliard and jeer  And of duty every rig  But my joy and delight  Is on Saturday night  A drop of the creature to swig  BALLAD  IN THE WAGS  EXCEPT the folks that's fast asleep  All nature now is waking  Aurora at the world a peep  Is in her nightcap taking  Hark all the tory rory boys  Making a devil of a noise  To cure the headach of last night  The paceable king's subjects fright  And helter skelter come apace  To enjoy the pleasures of the chase  II  How sweet to be as on we rush  By the pigtail entangling  Amidst a lovely torny bush  Or on a tree left dangling  Ah musha gra than wine or love  The joy of hunting's far above  Can either Cupid or the bowl  Such pleasures give ah by my soul  Briars and torns may scratch your face  Still great's the pleasure of the chase  III  Then when our mettle's at its pitch  While tallyho we're bawling  Safe landed in a muddy ditch  To be genteelly sprawling  Ah musha gra than wine or love  The joy of hunting's far above  Can either Cupid or the bowl  Such pleasure give Ah by my soul  Let muddy ditches wash your face  Still great's the pleasure of the chase  IV  Then dripping like a drowning rat  At night you would not think it  What glorious wine if it were not  We're too fatigued to drink it  Ah bodder not of love and war  The joy of hunting's greater sar  Hark echo in melodious tones  Hollas and whistles and sings and groans  While many a broken sconce and face  Proclaim the pleasures of the chase  BALLAD  IN THE WAGS  WE bipeds made up of frail clay  Alas are the children of sorrow  And though brish and merry today  We all may be wretched tomorrow  For sunshine's succeeded by rain  Then fearful of life's stormy weather  Lest pleasure should only bring pain  Let us all be unhappy together  II  I grant the best blessing we know  Is a friend for true friendship's a treasure  And yet lest your friend prove a foe  Oh taste not the dangerous pleasure  Thus friendship's a flimsy affair  Thus riches and health are a bubble  Thus there's nothing delightful but care  Nor any thing pleasing but trouble  III  If a mortal would point out that life  Which on earth could be nearest to heaven  Let him thanking his stars chuse a wife  To whom truth and honour are given  But honour and truth are so rare  And horns when they're cutting so tingle  That with all my respect to the fair  I'd advise him to sigh and live single  IV  It appears from these premises plain  That wisdom is nothing but folly  That pleasure's a term that means pain  And that joy is your true melancholy  That all those who laugh ought to cry  That 'tis fine frisk and fun to be grieving  And that since we must all of us die  We should taste no enjoyment while living  BALLAD  IN THE WAGS

heaven above  The fervent orisons are flown  The tender prayer  Thou put'st up there  Shall call a guardian angel down  To watch me in the battle  II  My safety thy fair truth shall be  As sword and buckler serving  My life shall be more dear to me  Because of thy preserving  Let peril come let horror threat  Let thundering cannons rattle  I'll fearless seek the conflict's heat  Assured when on the wings of love  To heaven above c  III  Enough with that benignant smile  Some kindred God inspired thee  Who knew thy bosom void of guile  Who wondered and admired thee  I go assured my life adieu  Though thundering cannons rattle  Though murdering carnage stalk in view  When on the wings of thy true love  To heaven above c  BALLAD  IN THE WAGS  I be one of they sailors who thinks 'tis no lie  That for every wherefore of life there's a why  That be fortune's strange weather a calm or a squall  Our births good or bad are chalked out for us all  That the stays and the braces of life will be found  To be some of 'em rotten and some of 'em sound  That the good we should cherish the bad never seek  For death will too soon bring each anchor apeak  II  When astride on the yard the toplifts they let go  And I com'd like a shot plump among 'em below  Why I cotch'd at a halliard and jump'd upon deck  And so broke my fall to save breaking my neck  Just like your philosophers for all their jaw  Who less than a rope gladly catch at a straw  Thus the good we should cherish the bad never seek  For death will too soon bring each anchor apeak  III  Why now that there cruise that we made off the banks  Where I pepper'd the foe and got shot for my thanks  What then she soon struck and though crippled on shore  And laid up to refit I had shiners galore  At length live and looking I tried the false main  And to get more prize money got shot at again  Thus the good we should cherish the bad never seek  For death will too soon bring each anchor apeak  IV  Then just as it comes take the bad with the good  One man's spoon's made of silver another's of wood  What's poison for one man's another man's balm  Some are safe in a storm and some lost in a calm  Some are rolling in riches some not worth a souse  Today we eat beef and tomorrow lobsscouse  Thus the good we should cherish the bad never seek  For death will too soon bring each anchor apeak  BALLAD  IN THE WAGS  THE sun's

I've carried in my wherry  For then no mortal soul like me  So merrily did jog it  I lov'd my wife and friend d'ye see  And won the prize of Dogget  In coat and badge so neat and spruce  I row'd all blithe and merry  And every waterman did use  To call me happy Jerry  II  But times soon changed I went to sea  My wife and friend betrayed me  And in my absence treacherously  Some pretty frolics played me  Return'd I used them like a man  But still 'twas so provoking  I could not joy my very can  Nor even fancy smoaking  In tarnish'd badge and coat so queer  No longer blithe and merry  Old friends now passed me with a sneer  And called me dismal Jerry  III  At sea as with a dangerous wound  I lay under the surgeons  Two friends each help I wanted found  In every emergence  Soon after my sweet friend and wife  Into this mess had brought me  These two kind friends who sav'd my life  In my misfortunes sought me  We're come cried they that once again  In coat and badge so merry  Your kind old friends the watermen  May hail you happy Jerry  IV  I'm Peggy once your soul's desire  To whom you prov'd a rover  Who since that time in man's attire  Have sought you the world over  And I cried t'other am that Jack  When boys you used so badly  Though now the best friend to your back  Then prithee look not sadly  Few words are best I seiz'd their hands  My grateful heart grew merry  And now in love and friendship's bands  I'm once more happy Jerry  BALLAD  IN THE WAGS  BOLD Jack the sailor here I come  Pray how d'ye like my nib  My trowsers wide my trampers rum  My nab and

constant been to ten cried I  But never grieved for one  The flowing sails we tars unbend  To lead a jovial life  In every mess to find a friend  In every port a wife  III  I've a spanking wife at Portsmouth gates  A pigmy at Goree  An orangetawny up the straits  A black at St Lucie  Thus whatsomedever course I bend  I leads a jovial life  In every mess I find a friend  In every port a wife  IV  Will Gaft by Death was ta'en aback  I came to bring the news  Poll wimper'd sore but what did Jack  Why stood in William's shoes  She cut I chased but in the end  She loved me as her life  And so she got an honest friend  And I a loving wife  V  Thus be we sailors all the go  On fortune's sea we rub  We works and loves and fights the foe  And drinks the generous bub  Storms that the mast to splinters rend  Can't shake our jovial life  In every mess we finds a friend  In every port a wife  BALLAD  IN THE WAGS  LET bucks and let bloods to praise London agree  Oh the joys of the country my

honey when it 'ent snowing  Where nature to smile when she joyful inclines  And the sun charms us all the year round when it shines  Oh the mountains and vallies and bushes  The pigs and the screechowls and thrushes  Let bloods and let bucks to praise London agree  Oh the joys of the country my jewel for me  II  There twelve hours on a stretch we in angling delight  As patient as Jobs though we get ne'er a bite  There we pop at the wild ducks and frighten the crows  While so lovely the icicles hang to our cloaths  There wid aunts and wid cousins and grandmothers talking  We're caught in the rain as we're all out a walking  While the muslins and gauzes cling round each fair she  That they look all like Venuses sprung from the sea  Oh the mountains c  III  Then how sweet in

bed  Oh the mountains c  BALLAD  IN THE WAGS  HARK the din of distant war  How noble is the clangor  Pale death ascend his ebon car  Clad in terrific anger  A doubtful fate the soldier tries  Who

disdaining fear  Rush on the desperate duty  Shall claim the tribute of the tear  That dims the eye of beauty  A doubtful fate c  III  What nobler fate can fortune give  Renown shall tell our story  If we should fall but if we live  We live our country's glory  'Tis true a doubtful fate c  BALLAD  IN THE WAGS  IF the beauty of truth unadorn'd is seen best  The man that is drunk of fair truth is the test  For liquor man's natural temper assumes  While every thing artful flies off with the fumes  The vizor of life is pull'd off by the bowl  And the face of a drunkard exhibits his soul  Then beware all who are in rascality sunk  You'll all be detected if once you get drunk  II  If contempt of all danger true courage e'er gave  The man that is drunk as a lion is brave  For like any Caesar he'll riot and storm  And talk of great feats he's too weak to perform  He'll utter big oaths know not what to be at  Thump his head with his fist but there's nothing in that  Then beware braggadociaes in cowardice sunk  You'll all be detected if once you get drunk  III  If strong ipse dixit true wisdom implies  The man that is drunk is like Solomon wise  For of cocks and of bulls he'll tell many a tale  And swear to the truth of 'em rather than fail  He'll reconcile opposites prove false is true  Vouch he does no  know what of he does not know who  Then beware all ye varlets in falsity sunk  You'll all be detected if once you get drank  II  Come on let us drink then right conscious the bowl  In each rosy cheek though it light up the soul  Can nothing of worldly deformity shew  Nor prove that we ought but with honesty glow  'Tis the ordeal of truth and of gen'rous delight  Which to keep us all honest we'll try every night  Proving still by our acts in no meanness we're sunk  But true honest friends whether sober or drunk  BALLAD  IN THE WAGS  THE wind was hush'd the storm was over  Unfurl'd was every flowing sail  From toil released when Dick of Dover  Went with his

Poll was quite unknown to Jack  Tant masted all to see who's tallest  Breast works top gantsails and a fan  Messmate cried I more sail than ballast  Ah still give me my buxom Nan  IV  None on life's

 To paint ah what can words avail  She's Venus' self and so completely  That Celia is like Venus frail  To woo the charming Gloriana  Audacity would stand afraid  She chaste and icy as Diana  And like

Will take to mount up tries  All scrambling go  Both friend and foe  To bear away some prize  And each throws dust to blind him  Plump in his neighbour's eyes  BALLAD  IN THE WAGS  IF bold and brave

Father Thames enter'd Westminster hall  Threatening all law and justice with ruin  But let not their terrors these lawyers confound  The old proverb decrees they can never be drown'd  II  Of the

louder and louder  From every tiewig wash'd away  Common sense with the curls and the powder  But why thus should water these lawyers confound  When the proverb decrees they can never be drown'd  III  Cries one they're found out in their tricks  No wonder they put such despair on  They fancy the Thames is the Styx  And each old crazy waterman Charon  That they'll soon before Minos be brought  Where nought avails twisting and turning  And where they'll in this case be taught  That drowning's an alias for burning  Yet at no rate should water these lawyers confound  They may burn to be sure but

Trumpets and drums  Shouts groans and thund'ring cannons read the sky  The banners flutt'ring late in air  Now from the bearers grasp are torn  And on the spear  Of victory borne  The stroke's

who deaf to the soft calls of nature  And flint to the core will unkindly refuse  Though the trifle were life to a poor fellow creature  To broach that vile hoard he wants spirit to use  Not grieved

sailor  Alert in his duty he readily flies  Where winds the tir'd vessel are flinging  Though sunk to the sea gods or toss'd to the skies  Still Jack is found working and singing  Long side of an enemy boldly and brave  He'll with broadside on broadside regale her  Yet he'll sigh to the soul o'er that enemy's grave  So noble's the mind of a sailor  Let cannons roar loud burst their sides let the bombs  Let the winds a dread hurricane rattle  The rough and the pleasant he take as it comes  And laughs at the storm and the battle  In a fostering power while Jack puts his trust  As fortune comes smling he'll hail her  Resign'd still and manly since what must be must  And this is the mind of a sailor  Though careless and headlong if danger should press  And rank'd 'mongst the free list of rovers  Yet he'll melt into tears at a tale of distress  And prove the most constant of lovers  To rancour unknown to no passion a slave  Nor unmanly nor mean nor a railer  He's gentle as mercy as fortitude brave  And this is a true English sailor  BALLAD  IN THE WAGS  BLEST Friendship hail thy gifts possessing  That happy mortal's rich indeed  Thou willing giv'st each earthly blessing  To all

time for thee to play the stranger  Thou deign'st to manage all his house  To make him thy good pleasure tarry  To kiss thy feet to leap o'er sticks  To run to hop to fetch to carry  And play a

become my own  BALLAD  IN THE WAGS  WHAT song shall I chant while I sing Venus sparrows  Her cestus her dove  Shall I hold forth on love  Source of so many blessings and ills  On which so many Cupids have blunted their arrows  And so many poets their quills  All its pains and its pleasures its mischiefs and joys  Have been sung o'er and o'er by fond girls and vain boys  Not a single new thought the Pierian spring  On love can inspirenor of love will I sing  II  While I celebrate uproar and bottles and glasses  That fools think divine  Shall my song be on wine  Source of so many surfeits and feasts  Where so many topers have toasted their lasses  And so many men become beasts  Let those describe wine who can drink till they reel  'Twere folly to write on a theme I can't feel  How can I who ne'er drink but what flows from health's spring  Find words the delight of a drunkard to sing  III  While I celebrate men who all comfort and pleasure  Leave at home for a name  Shall I descant on fame  Source of so many murders and woes  Where so many heroes have plunder'd for treasure  And so many friends become foes  A stranger to battles and all their delight  Fond of peace and its joys I can't shudder and write  The best plume that e'er hero bore off from fame's wing  Should not tempt me a scene of such horror to sing  IV  What shall be my song Shall I celebrate riches  Whose grasp can combine  Love glory and wine  Source of each mortal man's rise and fall  That thing youth and age high and low that bewitches  A nothing that comprehends all  Be the theme these of others they cannot be mine  Till love's led by prudence by temperance wine  Till war shall sweet peace and gold charity bring  Reason smiles and forbids me such folly to sing  BALLAD  IN THE WAGS  BUT perhaps

their jaw would coil up could they measure  By their feelings the gen'rous delight without end  That gives birth in us tars to that truest of pleasure  The handing our rhino to succour a friend  IV  Why what's all this nonsense they talks of and pother  About rights of man What a plague are they at  If they means that each man to his messmate's a brother  Why the lubberly swabs ev'ry fool can

THEATRICALS  I that once was a ploughman a sailor am now  No lark that aloft in the sky  Ever flutter'd his wings to give speed to the plough  Was so gay or so careless as I  But my friend was a carfindo aboard a king's ship  And he ax'd me to go just to sea for a trip  And he talk'd of such things  As if sailors were kings  And so teazing did keep  That I left my poor plough to go plouging the deep  No longer the horn  Call'd me up in the morn  I trusted the carfindo and the inconstant wind  That made me for to go and leave my dear behind  II  I did not much like for to be aboard aship  When in danger there's no door to creep out  I liked the jolly tars I liked bumbo and flip  But I did not like rocking about  By and by comes a hurricane I did not like that  Next a battle that many a sailor laid flat  Ah cried I who would roam  That like me had a home  Where I'd sow and I'd reap  Ere I left my poor plough to go ploughing the deep  Where sweetly the horn  Call'd me up in the morn  Ere I trusted the carfindo and the inconstant wind  That made me for to go and leave my dear behind  III  At last safe I landed and in a whole skin  Nor did I make any long stay  Ere I found by a friend whom I ax'd for my kin  Father dead and my wife ran away  Ah who but thyself said I hast thou to blame  Wives losing their husbands oft lose their good name  Ah why did I roam  When so happy at home  I could sow and could reap  Ere I left my poor plough to go ploughing the deep  When so sweetly the horn  Call'd me up in the morn  Curse light upon the carfindo and the inconstant wind  That made me for to go and leave my dear behind  IV  Why if that be the case said this very same friend  And you ben't no more minded to roam  Gis a shake by the fist all your care's at an end  Dad's alive and your wife safe at home  Stark staring with joy I leapt out of my skin  Buss'd my wife mother sister and all of my kin  Now cried I let them roam  Who want a good home  I am well so I'll keep  Nor again leave my plough to go ploughing the deep  Once more shall the horn  Call me up in the morn  Nor shall any damn'd carfindo nor the inconstant wind  E'er tempt me for to go and leave my dear

heaven sent  That tear'st away the thorn of grief  And plant'st instead the rose content  Thy smallest spark such lustre owns  With it such truth and dignity it brings  It throws obscurity on thrones  And beams to dim the diadem of kings  BALLAD  IN PRIVATE THEATRICALS  WHY good people all at what do you pry  Is't the stump of my arm or my leg  Or the place where I lost my goodlooking eye  Or is it to see me beg  Lord love you hard fortune is nothing at all  And he's but a fool and a dunce  Who expects when he's running full butt 'gainst a wall  Not to get a good rap on the sconce  If beg borrow or steal be the choice of mankind  Surely I choose the best of the three  Besides as times go what a comfort to find  That in this bad world there's some charity  II  For a soldier I listed to grow great in fame  And be shot at for sixpence a day  Lord help the poor poultry wherever I came  For how could I live on my pay  I went to the wars to fight the king's foes  Where the bullets came whistling by  Till they swiv'led three ribs broke the bridge of my nose  Queer'd my napper and knock'd out my eye  Well what of all this I'd my legs and my arms  And at Chelsea to lay up was free  Where my pipe I could smoak talk of battles and storms  And bless his good majesty's charity  III  But thinking it shameful to live at my ease  Away while the frolic was warm  In search of good fortune I sails the salt seas  And so loses my leg and my arm  With two strings to my bow I now thought myself sure  But such is the fortune of war  As a lobster at Greenwich they shew'd me the door  At Chelsea they call'd me a tar  So falling to nothing between these two stools  I the whole world before me was free  To ask comfort from misers and pity from fools  And live on that air men's charity  IV  And what now of all this here patter at last  How many who hold their heads high  And in fashion's fine whirligig fly round so fast  Are but beggars as well as I  The courtier he begs for a snug sinecure  For a smile beg your amorous elves  Churchwardens hand the plate and beg round for the poor  Just to pamper and fatten themselves  Thus we're beggars throughout the whole race of

When on as sweet a morn  In Hymen's fane one fate to share  Anna and I were sworn  Sweetly the thrush in varied song  The vacant joy encreas'd  When kindly came the village throng  To join the marriage feast  But sweeter sang the nightingale  Love's herald of the grove  When Cynthia through the silver vale  Led to the bow'r of love  II  The lark's sweet morning song of joy  Is known by that

was her tender bosom sad  Whene'er she heard the loud reveilez  The fifes were screechowls to her ears  The drums like thunder seem'd to rattle  Ah too prophetic were her fears  They call'd him from her arms to battle  There wonders he against the foe  Perform'd and was with laurels crown'd  Vain pomp for soon death laid him low  On the cold ground  II  Her heart all love her soul all truth  That none her fears or flight discover  Poor Peg in guise a comely youth  Follow'd to the field her lover  Directed by the fife and drum  To where the work of death was doing  Where of brave hearts the time was come  Who seeking honour grasp at ruin  Her very soul was chill'd with woe  New horror came in every sound  And whisper'd death had lain him low  On the cold ground  III  With mute affliction as she stood  While her woman's fears confound her  With terror all her soul subdued  A mourning train came thronging round her  The plaintive fife and muffl'd drum  The martial obsequies discover  His name she heard and cried I come  Faithful to meet my murder'd lover  Then heartrent by a sigh of woe  Fell to the grief of all around  Where death had laid her lover low  On the cold ground  BALLAD  IN PRIVATE THEATRICALS  MANKIND all get drunk ay and womankind too  As by proof I shall presently shew you  See that upstart to power who unworthily grew  With good fortune so drunk he don't

sail'd round the world without fear or dismay  I've seen the wind foul and I've seen the wind fair  I've been wounded and shipwreck'd and trick'd of my pay  But a brave British sailor should never despair  II  When in a French prison I chanced for to lie  With no light from the heavens and scarce any air  In a dungeon instead of in battle to die  Was dismal I own but I did not despair  III  But Lord this is nothingmy poor upper works  Got shatter'd and I was obliged to repair  I've been shot by the French and a slave 'mongst the Turks  But a brave British sailor should never despair  IV  But for all these misfortunes I'd yet cut a dash  Laid snug up my timbers and never known care  If the agent had not ran away with the cash  And so many brave fellows plung'd into despair  V  So coming long side of our bold royal tar  I told him the rights on't for why should I care  Of my wrongs and my hardships and wounds in the wars  And if how he would right me I should not despair  VI  Says his highness says he such ill treatment as thine  Is a shame and henceforward thy fortune's my care  So now blessings on him sing out me and mine  And thus British seamen should never despair  VII  So straightway he got it made into a law  That each tar of his rhino should have his full share  And so agents d'ye see may coil up their slack jaw  For the duke is our friend and we need not despair  VIII  Then push round the grog though we face the whole world  Let our royal tar's pennant but fly in the air  And the sails of our navy again be unfurl'd  We'll strike wond'ring nations with awe and despair  BALLAD  IN PRIVATE THEATRICALS  DAPPER Ted Tattoo is my natty name  For a roll or a trevally  Among the girls loud sounds my fame  When I their quarters rally  For with fife and drum  I smirking come  Leer cock my hat  Swear and all that  Nor ever dread  A broken head  Where the cause of strife's a doxy  But as for wars  And wounds and scars  And fighting foes  And thumps and blows  I'd rather fight by proxy  II  When chiefs and privates mingled lie  And gasp without assistance  In baggage waggon perch'd up I  Stand umpire at a distance  And with fife and drum  I smirking come  'Mongst soldier's wives  Who lead merry lives  Nor ever dread  A broken head  Where the cause of strife's a doxy  Let their husbands go  And 'gainst the foe  Gain glory's scars  In honour's wars  I'd rather fight by proxy  III  Yet think ye I am not renowned  In foreign wars and civil  Why sir when safe at home and sound  Zounds I could fight the devil  And with fife and drum  Can smirking come  And cock my hat  Leer and all that  Nor ever dread  A broken head  When the cause of strife's a doxy  Let others go  And 'gainst the foe  Gain glory's scars  In honour's wars  I'd rather fight by proxy  IV  Thus through the world I make a noise  Where'er I'm a sojourner  The mighty wonder and surprise  Of every chimney corner  Where with fife and drum  I smirking come  And rap out zounds  And talk of wounds  Nor ever dread  A broken head  Where the cause of strife's a doxy  They're fools who go  And 'gainst the foe  In glory's wars  Gain honour's scars  I'm wise and fight by proxy  BALLAD  IN PRIVATE THEATRICALS  LADIES and gentlemen I'm a beau  A beau I have been all my life  And yet may the devil fetch me if I know  How I whose whole trade is  To tickle up the ladies  Have never yet got me a wife  I started in life 'bout the year sixtytwo  My small clothes were scarlet my stockings were blue  My shoes were halfboots pudding sleeves too I wore  My hat in the true pistol cock and the more  O'er the fair to prevail  I sported a fine ramilie for a cue  For what's a beau or a monkey without a tail  II  Fashion thus yields to fashion as night yields to day  The huge hat that was cock'd with an air  Soon was kick'd out of doors of the smart Nivernois  The charm'd world sung the praises  The belles put on jazies  And the beaux sported now their own hair  By that time it came to the year seventytwo  The fashions a mixture of old were and new  Your hair like a bushel might look or a wig  Or nine hairs of a side with the tail of a pig  For me o'er the fair to prevail  I had seven yards of ribbon to make me a queue  For what's a beau or a monkey without a tail  III  Again with the varying modes did I jump  Of fashion I gave the grand pas  My coat hung to my heels or was tuck'd to my rump  In all circles shoving  A beau or a sloven  With a slouch or a chapeau de bras  Thus I sported my figure about eightytwo  Drove a twostory gig that four poney rats drew  Wore a coat with seven capes thirteen waistcoats in one  And that I might ne'er be in folly outdone  With the fair to prevail  A large porter's knot would have scarce held my queue  For what's a beau or a monkey without a tail  IV  Thus in all sorts of modish assemblies the first  Have my purse health and spirits been hack'd  But the polish worn off nothing left but the rust  I of fashion's strange stages  Like Shakespear's seven ages  Play the farce though I'm in the last act  Arrived to the year of our Lord ninetytwo  I dress and I coax and I flirt but 'twont do  At a hundred and one I should still be a fop  But done up and nick named by the world the grey crop  Can I hope to prevail  To play gallantry's part I have now lost my cue  For what's a beau or a monkey without a tail  BALLAD  IN PRIVATE THEATRICALS  ALAS the battle's lost and won  Dick Flint's born off the field  By death from whom the stoutest run  Who makes whole armies yield  Dick well in honour's footsteps trod  Brav'd war and its alarms  Now death beneath the humble sod  Has grounded his arms  II  Dick's march'd before us on a rout  Where ev'ry soldiers sent  His fire is dead his courage out  His ammunition spent  His form so active's now a clod  His grace no longer charms  For death beneath the humble sod  Has grounded his arms  III  Come fire a volley o'er his grave  Dead marches let us beat  War's honours well become the brave  Who found their last retreat  All must obey fate's awful nod  Whom life this moment warms  Death soon or late beneath the sod  Will ground the soldier's arms  BALLAD  IN PRIVATE THEATRICALS  ADIEU my gallant sailor obey thy duty's call  Though false the sea there's truth ashore  Till nature is found changing thou'rt sure of constant Poll  And yet as now we sever  Ah much I fear that never  Shall I alas behold thee more  II  Jack kiss'd her hitch'd his trowsers and hied him to begone  Weigh'd anchor and lost sight of shore  Next day a brisk southwester a heavy gale brought on  Adieu cried Jack for ever  For much I fear that never  Shall I sweet Poll behold you more  III  Poll heard that to the bottom was sunk her honest tar  And for a while lamented sore  At length cried she I'll marry what should I tarry for  I may lead apes for ever  Jack's gone and never never  Shall I alas behold him more  IV  Jack safe and sound returning sought out his faithful Poll  Think not cried she that false I swore  I'm constant still as ever 'tis nature's chang'd that's all  And thus we part for ever  For never sailor never  Shall I alas behold you more  V  If as you say that nature like winds can shift and veer  About ship for a kindershore  I heard the trick you play'd me and so d'ye see my dear  To a kind heart for ever  I've spliced myself so never  Shall I false Poll behold you more  BALLAD  IN PRIVATE THEATRICALS  SPANKING Jack was so comely so pleasant so jolly  Though winds blew great guns still he'd whistle and sing  Jack lov'd his friend and was true to his Molly  And if honour gives greatness was great as a king  One night as we drove with two reefs in the main sail  And the scud came on low'ring upon a lee shore  Jack went up aloft for to hand the top gantsail  A spray wash'd him off and we ne'er saw him more  But grieving's a folly  Come let us be jolly  If we've troubles at sea boys we've pleasures ashore  II  Whiffling Tom still of mischief or fun in the middle  Through life in all weathers at random would jog  He'd dance and he'd sing and he'd play on the fiddle  And swig with an air his allowance of grog  Long side of a Don in the Terrible frigate  As yard arm and yard arm we lay off the shore  In and out whiffling Tom did so caper and jig it  That his head was shot off and we ne'er saw him more  But grieving's a folly c  III  Bonny Ben was to each jolly messmate a brother  He was manly and honest good natured and free  If ever one tar was more true than another  To his friend and his duty that sailor was he  One day with the david to heave the cadge anchor  Ben went in the boat on a bold craggy shore  He overboard tipt when a shark and a spanker  Soon nipt him in two and we ne'er saw him more  But grieving's a folly c  IV  But what of it all lads shall we be down hearted  Because that mayhap we now take our last sup  Life's cable must one day or other be parted  And death in safe moorings will bring us all up  But 'tis always the way on't one scarce finds a brother  Fond as pitch honest hearty and true to the core  But by battle or storm or some damn'd thing or other  He's popp'd off the hooks and we ne'er see him more  But grieving's a folly c  BALLAD  IN PRIVATE THEATRICALS  ARRAH if 'tis no lie in this world we are living  And it en't for 'tis seen every day  That the truest of joys honest hearts are receiving  Are those they are giving away  Sure men are all sisters and cousins and brothers  And 'tis clear to the stupidest elf  That the best kind of comfort a man gives to others  Is that which he takes to himself  Thus this bodder and game this same meum and tuum  Means the devil a meaning but suum  II  For your friend's peace of mind should you let your mouth water  And be getting the wish you obtain  In possessing his purse or his wife or his daughter  What delight would the joy be but pain  Then let knav'ry alone the vain work's useless labour  Be't for love or for pow'r or for pelf  For every wrong that a man does his neighbour  Sure is not he doing himself  Thus this bodder c  III  If I'm rich and should chuse to do good to another  Arrah fait for the selfish design  Devil tank me for if you allow I'm his brother  Faith and conscience sure in not he mine  But says musty morality chuse objects fitting  Just your sermons lay by on the shelf  Why you stupid old big wig arrah sure 'ent I getting  For one joy of his ten for myself  Thus this bodder c  IV  Then from such botheration in pity release us  Fortune all you bestow will repay  And though poor as Job you'll be all rich as Craesus  For you'll keep what you've given away  The fine generous maxim then while you're pursuing  Spend your all to hoard mountains of pelf  Soar high while you're sinking be prosp'rous in ruin  And give joy to enjoy it yourself  And thus have I proved c  BALLAD  IN PRIVATE THEATRICALS  BLEAK was the morn when William left his Nancy  The fleecy snow frown'd on the whiten'd shore  Cold as the fears that chill'd her dreary fancy  While she her sailor from her bosom tore  To his fill'd heart a little Nancy pressing  While a young tar the ample trowsers ey'd  In need of firmness in this state distressing  Will check'd the rising sigh and fondly cried  Ne'er fear the perils of the fickle ocean  Sorrow's a notion  Grief all in vain  Sweet love take heart  For we but part  In joy to meet again  II  Loud blew the wind when leaning on that willow  Where the dear name of William printed stood  When Nancy saw toss'd by a faithless billow  A ship dash'd 'gainst a rock that topp'd the flood  Her tender heart with frantic sorrow thrilling  Wild as the storm that howl'd along the shore  No longer could resist a stroke so killing  'Tis he she cried nor shall I see him more  Why did he ever trust the fickle ocean  Sorrow's my portion  Misery and pain  Break my poor heart  For now we part  Never to meet again  III  Mild was the eve all nature was smiling  Four tedious years had Nancy pass'd in grief  When with her children the sad hours beguiling  She saw her William fly to her relief  Sunk in his arms with bliss he quickly found her  But soon return'd to life to love and joy  While her grown young ones anxiously surround her  And now Will clasps his girl and now his boy  Did I not say though 'tis a fickle ocean  Sorrow's all a notion  Grief all in vain  My joy how sweet  For now we meet  Never to part again  BALLAD  IN PRIVATE THEATRICALS  LIFE's a jest says the poet arrah sure 'tis a pun  Men call black for white through some quibbling pretence  And expressions still use where the sound is all one  Though as distant as London from Dublin the sense  Then let 'em now just go their gig and their fun  This life by my soul's nothing more than a pun  Where men play on our passions to turn us all fools  And make puns and quibbles that we may make bulls  II  That he's o'er head and ears the fond lover declares  And must marry or hangthe dear creature beset  Consents little dreaming he puns while he swears  For the taef does not mean he's in love but in debt  Then let them now just go their gig and their fun  This life by my soul's nothing more than a pun  Where fine dashing lovers fond widows turn fools  And make puns and quibbles that they may make bulls  III  That sweet babe says old Bolus I'll quickly restore  To that mother from whom the dear creature had birth  Punning rogue by and by sir the child is no more  So he lies and speaks truth for he meant mother earth  Then let them now just go their gig and their fun  This life by my soul's nothing more than a pun  And thus learned physicians their patients turn fools  And make puns and quibbles that they may make bulls  IV  Says the courtier my friend you shall have a snug place  A douceur or two more and your suit cannot fail  The dear punning courtier gets into disgrace  And you get sure enough a snug place in a jail  Then let 'em now just go their gig and their fun  This life by my soul's nothing more than a pun  And thus courtiers turn their dependants all fools  And make puns and quibbles that they may make bulls  V  Thus one thing they say and another express  Thus feathers cut throats thus are sycophants civil  Don't bishops and ladies say no and mean yes  Don't we call women angels for playing the devil  Then let them now just go their gig and their fun  This life by my soul's nothing more than a pun  Thus men laugh in their sleeves while they turn their friends fools  And make puns and quibbles that they may make bulls  RONDEAU  IN PRIVATE

Your natty sparks and flashy dames  How I do love to queer  I runs my rigs  And patters and gigs  And plays a hundred comical games  To all that I comes near  Then in a pet  To hear 'em fret  A

the fellow I saw grinning through  " the horse collar in the country"  ' I fancy you're the fellow I saw grinning through  ' the pillory in London'  Wo Ball wo  So to mind 'em I ne'er seem  But whistles and drives my team  BALLAD  IN PRIVATE THEATRICALS  I SING of that life of delight beyond measure  That tars calmly lead on the boisterous main  Where toil is enjoyment where trouble's all pleasure  And where men lose their lives a sure fortune to gain  Where you fear no diseases but sickness and scurvy  Where the water stinks sweetly by way of a zest  Where you walk on your legs when you're not topsy turvy  And where though you sleep soundly you're never at rest  Then push round the can oh you have not a notion  Of sailors their grog and their sweethearts and wives  Ah give me my soul the tight lads of the ocean  Who though they're so wretched lead such happy lives  II  Then you're always of billows and winds in the middle  That so dash and so whistle and bodder your ears  And play a duet with the tar's song and fiddle  So sweetly that sounds and that nobody hears  Then to see the tight lads how they laugh at a stranger  Who fears billows can drown and nine pounders can kill  For you're safe sure enough were you not in such danger  And might loll at your ease if you could but sit still  Then push round the can c  III  What of perils that always the same are so various  And through shot holes and leaks leave wide open death's doors  Devil a risk's in a battle wer't not so precarious  Storms were all gig and fun but for breakers and shores  In short a tar's life you may say dat I told it  Who leaves quiet and peace foreign countries to roam  Is of all other lives I'll be bound to uphold it  The best life in the world next to staying at home  Then push round the can c  BALLAD  THIS here's what I doesI d'ye see forms a notion  That our troubles our sorrows and strife  Are the winds and the billows that foment the ocean  As we work through the passage of life  And for fear on life's sea lest the vessel should founder  To lament and to weep and to wail  Is a pop gun that tries to out roar a nine pounder  All the same as a whiff in a gale  Why now I though hard fortune has pretty near starv'd me  And my togs are all ragged and queer  Ne'er yet gave the bag to the friend that had serv'd me  Or caus'd ruin'd beauty a tear  II  Now there tother day when my messmate deceiv'd me  Stole my rhino my chest and our Poll  Do you think in revenge while their treachery griev'd me  I a court martial call'dnot at all  This here on the matter was my way of arg'ing  'Tis true they han't left me a cross  A vile wife and false friend though are gone by the bargain  So the gain d'ye see's more than the loss  For though fortune's a jilt and has c  III  The heart's allwhen that's built as it should sound and clever  We go 'fore the wind like a fly  But if rotten and crank you may luff up for ever  You'll always sail in the wind's eye  With palaver and nonsense I'm not to be paid off  I'm adrift let it blow then great guns  A gale a fresh breeze or the old gemman's head off  I takes life rough and smooth as it runs  Content though hard fortune c  FINALE  IN THE COALITION  LAWYERS pay you with words and fine ladies with vapours  Your parsons with preaching and dancers with capers  Soldier's pay you with courage and some with their lives  Some men with their fortunes and some with their wives  Some with fame some with conscience and many throw both in  Physicians with latin and great men with nothing  I not to be singular in such a throng  For your kindness pay you with the end of a song  II  But pleading engrossing declaring and vap'ring  And fighting and hectoring and dancing and capering  And preaching and swearing and bullyingprescribing  And coaxing and wheedling and feeing and bribing  And every professional art of humdrumming  Is clearly in some sort a species of humming  Hummingnay take me with you the term's very strong  But I only meant humming the end of a song  III  For all who this evening have paid me attention  I would I had language of some new invention  My thanks to return for where's the expression  Can describe of your kindness the grateful impression  May every desire of your hearts be propitious  Be lasting success the result of your wishes  Unimpair'd be your joys your lives happy and long  And now I am come to the end of my song  THE END  INDEX  A  And did you hear what sad disaster  A sailor and an honest heart  Arrah Pat did you leave your poor Unah to mourn  Away pale fear
