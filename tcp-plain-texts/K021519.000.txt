 THE SIEGE of GIBRALTAR A MUSICAL FARCE IN TWO ACTS As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  By  F PILON  LONDON Printed for G KEARSLY No Fleetstreet MDCCLXXX Price ONE SHILLING  ADVERTISEMENT  THE very favourite Song of "How stands the glass around my boys" is so peculiarly adapted to the situation in which it is introduced that the Author hopes he will not be censured for the sacrifice he has made of originality in adopting it It is moreover written in a spirit and taste which is much easier to admire than equal As to the rest of the songs they are all his own and he fears he must trust more to the indulgence of the public in regard to them than to any thing he can say or has written in their favour  CHARACTERS  MEN  Major Bromfield  Mr REINHOLD  Ben Hassan  Mr

Officer  Towards evening I imagine  M Broom  Then here's a speedy demolition to them  Fills  All  Fill their glasses  A speedy demolition c  All drink  Beauc  They can raise no batteries to make any impression our works are actually impregnable and if the strength of this fortress be consider'd it may without fable be call'd one of the pillars of Hercules  M Broom  It is a pillar of the British empire and therefore should be defended 'till made the monument of its protectors  Enter  st Soldier    st Sold  A serjeant gentlemen is come with orders from the Governor  M Broom  Tell him to come in  Exit soldier  Enter Serjeant  O' Bradley  What O' Bradley is it you It's a wonder to see you sober just before an engagement  O' Brad  Why in troth your honour it was not for want of good will but there's no such thing as getting a drop for love or money  M Broom  Come let's see your book  O' Bradley  gives the Book    Give him some wineWe'll prime you O' Bradley  O' Brad  As your honour's hand's in I wish to he Lord you'd load me and you'd see how fine I'd go off against the Spaniards    d  Off  Giving him wine  Here O' Bradley  O' Brad  Smelling to the wine  Och your honour I wish you would change the wine into brandy for I am afraid the wine is too strong for me  M Broom  By all meansfill him some brandy    d  Off  Here O' Bradley  Fills a glass of brandy  and now your toast  O' Brad  A toast by my soul your honour as I am a great way from it I don't think I can give you a better toast than my native country and so here's the land we live in  O' Bradley drinks  All  Hh ha ha  O' Brad  Faith I thought you would laugh at me for the last time I gave the land we live in I was at sea and they sarved me in the same manner  M Broom  Why you live in Gibraltar how the devil can you give that as your native country  O' Brad  I am sorry to contradict your honour but I never think I live any where but in England or Ireland  M Broom  Gentlemen this is no time for continuing at the bottle the Governor expects us upon duty in less than two hours  O'Brad  By the sweet smell of the shamrock it is the joyfullest tidings I have heard this twelvemonth there's not a gun in the garrison but will thank me when I carry the news to him but I hope your honour there's no fear of a disappointment    d  Off  Why are you afraid we shant beat 'em  O' Brad  Och hone I am sure of that I was only afraid that they would not stay 'till we did them the favour  M Broom  Well we have no farther occasion for you O' Bradley  O' Brad  I hope your honour won't think me too bold if I ask a favour before I go  M Broom  What is it  O' Brad  Why if your honour pleases I should have no objection to the second part of the same tune  M Broom  The same tune What tune do you mean  O' Brad  Printing archly at the table  The tune jewel upon the musical glasses  M Brom  O you want another glass of brandy Here  Fills  but take care so much spirits don't get into your head  O' Brad  What is it the Brandy you mean By my soul there's no danger of that brandy's a French spirit and that never got into an Englishman's head or his heart either when he was going to battle therefore as I am an Irishman there's no fear of me so here goes I am sure it won't choak me  Drinks and exit  All  Ha ha ha    d  Off  Before we go one parting glass to England and victory  AIR  M BROWN and BEAUCLERK  How stands the glass around  For shame you take no care my boys  How stands the glass around  Let mirth and wine abound  The trumpets sound  The colours they are flying boys  To fight kill or wound  May we still be found  Content with our hard fate my boys  On the cold ground  II  Why soldiers why  Should we be melancholy boys  Why soldiers why  Whose business 'tis to die  Hang sighing fie  Damm fear drink on be jolly boys  'Tis he you or I  Cold hot wet or dry  We're always bound to follow boys  And scorn to fly  III  'Tis but in vain  I mean not to upbraid ye boys  'Tis but in vain  For soldiers to complain  Should next campaign  Send us to him who made us boys  We're free from pain  But if we remain  A bottle and kind landlady  Cure all again  Exeunt all but  Major  and  Ensign  Beauc  Dear Major will you indulge me with a moment's conversation  M Broom  What's the matter Frank  Beauc  You were my father's friend he put me under your care when I came into the army and I have ever looked up to you as to himself  M Broom  This is very true but what does it preface  Beauc  You know my passion for old Ben Hassan's daughter indeed you approved of it  M Brom  And is this a time to think of such sollies just when you are going to action Recollect yourself boy you are a soldier your father was one dishonour never changed his cheek and don't you bring a blush there in his old age  Beauc  Your reproach stings me to the very soul I have done with her I'll tear her from my heart for ever  M Broom  Your hand Frank now you are a man again  Beauc  But give me leave to do away the very shadow of cause for this degrading notion being entertained of my nature I meant only to have told you that the lovely woman in whom my whole life and happiness are wrapped up is this very night to be conveyed privately to Barbary in order to be married to Solomon the Jew whom you have often seen at her father's  M Broom  But are you sure of this  Beauc  An Arabian slave in whom she places great confidence told me of it but it is no matter you have convinced me of the impropriety of my passion and I resign her  M Broom  She's a devilish fine woman Frank  Beauc  I have drove her from my thoughts sir  M Broom  No no Frank you shan't lose her neither if in my power to prevent it Let me see  looks at his watch  I'll give you an hour go see her and learn the time and in what manner she and her Hebrew partner set off  Beauc  Dear sir are you serious  M Brom  Unless we silence the Spanish batteries the old Moor will hardly venture his daughter out this night If we should you shall patrole the very hour they are going off and stop her  Beauc  But sir can I be so long absent from my post without injury to my reputation  M Broom  Poh poh you are a blockhead if the story was published all over the garrison it would not  hurt you for I never knew a brave fellow notwithstanding what I said to you who did not acknowledge that beauty reigned by right divine and that there was no resisting the supremacy of a petticoat  AIR  BEAUCLERC  The moment I saw her my heart took alarm  I found that my freedom was gone  With transport I gaz'd on each delicate charm  Yet dar'd not to hope them my own  But what did I feel when I told her my flame  And she breath'd with a sigh that her's was the same  II  In praise of my fair I could dwell with delight  From blushing Aurora's first rise  'Till Phoebus had yielded his sceptre tonight  And Venus reign'd queen of the skies  Then wake with the nightingale all the night long  And pay with my sighs the musician's sweet song  Exit  Major  and  Beauclerc  SCENE II Ben Hassan's  House  Zayde  and  Jenny  are discovered  Jenny  Dear madam I am ready to faint with fright I hear they are just going to carbonade us  Zayde  You are a great coward Jenny  Jenny  Lord ma'am how can I help it this is the first time I was ever besieged in my life  Zayde  Is Muley returned  Jenny  I don't know indeed your ladyship O what would I give to be with my poor mother in Turnagainlane at Wapping  Zayde  I wish Jenny I could inspire you with a little of my resolution  AIR Omitted in the Representation  Zayde  Tho' war and danger threaten round  No fear my thoughts molest  For he who gives the deepest wound  Has only made me blest  II  Love fills my heart but not one sigh  The little tyrant brings  For when from him a dart did fly  He lent my hopes his wings  Jenny  O ma'am you make a perfect Nero of me  Enter  Muley  behind    He taps  Jenny  on the shoulder she shricks    Jenny  O lord ma'am they are come  Muley  O lord ma'am they are not come pluck up your spirits you'll not be shotperhaps these two hours  Zayde  Have you seen him Muley  Muley  And expect his signal at the lattice every moment but remember you resign yourself entirely to my direction  Zayde  It is strange my father should place so implicit a confidence in you  Muley  Not at all he purchased me at Cairo from an Arabian merchant when I was but four years old I never saw the father who begat me nor the mother who brought me into the world He knows I have no brother no sister no tie of kindred upon earth to make my affections wander from this spot He thinks I look up to him as my only relation but my attachment to my dear mistress united to the natural passion of man for liberty which only with life leaves us makes me do a violence to my nature and for the first time deceive him  Zayde  He took uncommon pains with your education  Muley  I am an Arabian madam and perhaps may thank my faculties more than my preceptors  Jenny  I vow Mr Muley this is the first time I ever knew you was a Barbarian  Muley  And it is the first time I knew it myself  Jenny  I thought you Barbarians had generally two heads at least  Muley  Two heads to be sure would be a great ornament to a man but with the additions generally made by a fashionable wife they are more I am sure than any man could carry upon his shouldersbut you'll not forget your promise madam  Zayde  I certainly will take you with me to England  with regard to your freedom I may be silent the moment you set your foot on the island you are no longer a bondsman the charter of England is Liberty you cannot breath its air and be a slave  AIR  ZAYDE  Generous Britain scorns to bind  In servile chains the freeborn mind  Her sons art brave her daughters fair  And Freedom lives a phoenix there  Generous Britain good as brave  Bestows that blessing on the slave  II  How slight are gems how poor is gold  In climes where man is bought and sold  A brighter jewel Freedom shines  Than ever glow'd in Indian mines  Generous Britain good as brave  Bestows that jewel on the slave  A tap is heard at the window  Zayde  O heavens I here he is let him in immediately  Muley  Go you Jenny  Exit  Jenny  I must stand centinel to prevent your father's stealing a march upon us  Exit  Muley  Reenter  Jenny  introducing  Beauclerc  Beauc  At the risque of my life at the risque of my reputation which I hold dearer I am come to you when my angel are you to go off in what disguise let me know every particular without delay not a moment I am here but is big with danger  Zayde  Fear and joy almost rob me of utterance We are if possible to leave this about twelve dressed in coarse Moorish habits a little red cross the emblem of your faith I'll wear upon my breast to distinguish me  Enter  Muley  Muley  Your father madam is coming  Beauc  Let me out instantly  Muley  You must not go yet sir I was prepared for this here clap on this turban and this habitBeauclerc  puts on the habit and turban  now don't open your lips but nod and make signsleave the rest to me  Enter  Ben Hassan  Ben  Speaks at entering  Daughter Zayde  Zayde  I attend your pleasure sir  Ben  By the tomb of Mahomet she shall go this night    Seeing  Beauclerc  What a stranger in my house Who is this fellow Muley  Muley  Lord sir don't you know him  Ben  Know him how the devil should I know him who is he  Muley  That's my brother sir  Ben  Your brother you dog you never saw one of your family in your life and how have you found out that this fellow is your brother  Muley  By the meerest accident in the world you must know sir for I never knew it 'till my brother here told me of it that I was stolen from my parents at two months old by a Gypsey who sold me at Cairo to the merchant of whom you bought me my father who loved his children dearer than his life had six sons besides myself  looks at Beauclere  seven I beg your pardon my father sir had seven sons beside myself  Ben  Damn your father and his seven sons rascal who are you talking to  Muley  My brother sir did'nt you see how angry he was at the mistake I made  Ben  Why the fellow has'nt open'd his lips  Muley  Dear sir let me go on with my story and you shall know all byandby my father sir who had seven sons besides myself and loved his children dearer than his life left it upon his death bed that a third of the estate together with the family pictures  Ben  Family pictures  Muley  Yes sir which were very valuable should go to whoever found his lost sheep for you must know sir he used always to call me his lost sheep  Ben  Your sleece Mr Lost Sheep is in great danger of a good threshing I can tell you that  Muley  Fortunately sir this brother whose name is Sinbad after numberless perils and hardships put up at the very inn at which you lodged at Cairo the landlord who had heard of the misfortunes of my  family introduced him to the merchant of whom you bought me the merchant kindly introduced him to your broker and the goodnatured broker never rested night or day 'till he actually found out the identical ship and captain in which sir you sailed with me from Cairo on board this sir he embarked about a fortnight since and after a short passage arrived at Algiers in Barbary from which place he came last night with a fresh supply of cabbages live oxen and fat turkies  Ben  Such a cargo of lies I believe never were jumbled together in so small a compass why you dog I'll have you impaled alive for bringing a male into my house  Muley  A male dear sir look at this upper lip  Ben  Eh why he has got no mustachios  Muley  Mustachios sir he was ten years in the seraglio at Constantinople  Ben  Come I'll ask the fellow some questions myself  Muley  You may spare yourself the trouble sir for poor fellow he is dumb  Ben  Dumb  Muley  Dumb sir  Ben  Then how the devil could he have given you this circumstantial account of your lost sheep and your estate and your family pictures you dog  Muley  By signsdo but look at him sir what do you think he is saying now  Ben  Why nothing  Muley  He says that in his travels through the different parts of the globe he never met a gentleman  of such a mild humane and winning disposition or one in whose service he would be more willingly employed  Ben  Why truly he is not an illlooking fellow but it is a great pity he is dumb  Muley  Sir you'll understand him as well as I do in less than a fortnight he was in great repute at the court of Persia for several years as a dumb interpreter  Ben  Well take hi  in and give him some refreshment I don't know but I may employ him  Muley  Look at him do but look at him sir if you did but understand him you'd be delighted with his gratitude  Ben  Ay what does he say  Muley  Say sir it would keep me here this hour if I was to tell you all but sir in a word he says his gratitude has struck him dumb  Exit  Muley  and  Beauclere  Ben  Truly this is an odd adventure come Hither Zayde I hope child you are better reconciled to your duty than I found you this morning  Zayde  Sir I am ready to obey your pleasure and long for the night  Ben  You transport me my dear girl  Jenny  And I'll go with her with a joyful heart  Ben  O then you are reconciled Mrs Pert to Visit Barbary  Jenny  Barbary sir I'll go to the Antidotes with her  Ben  And this morning you would go to the devil sooner than you would go to Barbary but I expect  no more regularity from a woman than a weathercock  AIR  Like a weather cock's a woman's will  With every blast it's veering still  As the wind blows  Around it goes  No whirligig so quick  Stop it if you can  But no mortal man  Steady to a point cou'd ever make it stick  II  You may think when a woman's a wife  That she rusts to a point for life  It's no such thing  She'll have her fling  Like a weathercock still  Round about she goes  As the wind then blows  And the devil to a point can't fix her will  SCENE III  The Inside of the Garrison  Enter two Soldiers    st Sold  A very
