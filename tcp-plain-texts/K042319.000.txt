whether on the whole operating for good or evil are things inseparable from free government This is a truth which I believe admits little dispute having been established by the uniform experience of all ages The part a good citizen ought to take in these divisions has been a matter of much deeper controversy But God forbid that any controversy relating to our essential morals should admit of no decision It appears to me that this question like most of the others which regard our duties in life is to be determined by our station in it Private men may be wholly neutral and entirely innocent but they who are legally invested with public trust or stand on the high ground of rank and dignity which is trust implied can hardly in any case remain indifferent without the certainty of sinking into insignificance and thereby in effect deserting that post in which with the fullest authority and for the wisest purposes the laws and institutions of their country have fixed them However if it be the office of those who are thus circumstanced to take a decided  part it is no less their duty that it should be a sober one It ought to be circumscribed by the same laws of decorum and balanced by the same temper which bound and regulate all the virtues In a word we ought to act in party with all the moderation which does not absolutely enervate that vigour and quench that fervency of spirit without which the best wishes for the public good must evaporate in empty speculation  IT is probably from some such motives that the friends of a very respectable party in this kingdom have been hitherto silent For these two years past from one and the same quarter of politics a continual fire has been kept upon them sometimes from the unwieldy column of quartos and octavos sometimes from the light squadrons of occasional pamphlets and flying sheets Every month has brought on its periodical calumny The abuse has taken every shape which the ability of the writers could give it plain invective clumsy raillery misrepresented anecdote  History of the Minority History of the Repeal of the Stampact Considerations on Trade and Finances Political Register c c  No method of vilifying the measures the abilities the intentions or the persons which compose that body has been omitted  ON their part nothing was opposed but patience and character It was a matter of the most serious and indignant affliction to persons who thought themselves in conscience bound to oppose a ministry dangerous from its very constitution as well as its measures to find themselves whenever they faced their adversaries continually attacked on the rear by a set of men who pretended to be actuated by motives similar to theirs They saw that the plan long pursued with but too fatal a success was to break the strength of this kingdom by frittering down the bodies which compose it by fomenting  bitter and sanguinary animosities and by dissolving every tie of social affection and public trust These virtuous men such I am warranted by public opinion to call them were resolved rather to endure every thing than cooperate in that design A diversity of opinion upon almost every principle of politics had indeed drawn a strong line of separation between them and some others However they were desirous not to extend the misfortune by unnecessary bitterness they wished to prevent a difference of opinion on the commonwealth from festering into rancorous and incurable hostility Accordingly they endeavoured that all past controversies should be forgotten and that enough for the day should be the evil thereof There is however a limit at which forbearance ceases to be a virtue Men may tolerate injuries whilst they are only personal to themselves But it is not the first of virtues to bear with moderation the indignities that are offered to our country A piece has at length appeared from the quarter of all the former attacks which upon every public consideration demands an answer Whilst persons more equal to this business may be engaged in affairs of greater moment I hope I shall be excused if in a few hours of a time not very important and from such materials as I have by me more than enough however for this purpose I undertake to set the facts and arguments of this wonderful performance in a proper light I will endeavour to state what this piece is the purpose for which I take it to have been written and the effects supposing it should have any effect at all it must necessarily produce  THIS piece is called  The present State of the Nation  It may be considered as a sort of digest of the avowed maxims of a certain political school the effects of whose doctrines and practices this country will feel long and severely It is made up of a farrago of almost every topic which has been agitated  in parliamentary debate or private conversation on national affairs for these seven last years The oldest controversies are hawled out of the dust with which time and neglect had covered them Arguments ten times repeated a thousand times answered before are here repeated again Public accounts formerly printed and reprinted revolve once more and find their old station in this sober meridian All the commonplace lamentations upon the decay of trade the encrease of taxes and the high price of labour and provisions are here retailed again and again in the same tone with which they have drawled through columns of Gazetteers and Advertisers for a century together Paradoxes which affront common sense and uninteresting barren truths which generate no conclusion are thrown in to augment unwieldy bulk without adding any thing to weight Because two accusations are better than one contradictions are set staring one another in the face without even an attempt to reconcile them And to give the whole a sort of portentous air of labour and information the table of the house of commons is swept into this grand reservoir of politics  AS to the composition it bears a striking and whimsical resemblance to a funeral sermon not only in the pathetic prayer with which it concludes but in the style and tenor of the whole performance It is piteously doleful nodding every now and then towards dulness well stored with pious frauds and like most discourses of the sort much better calculated for the private advantage of the preacher than the edification of the hearers  THE author has indeed so involved his subject that it is frequently far from being easy to comprehend his meaning It is happy for the public that it is never difficult to fathom his design The apparent intention of this author is to draw the most aggravated hideous and deformed picture of the  state of this country which his querulous eloquence aided by the arbitrary dominion he assumes over fact is capable of exhibiting Had he attributed our misfortunes to their true cause the injudicious tampering of bold improvident and visionary ministers at one period or to their supine negligence and traiterous dissensions at another the complaint had been just and might have been useful But far the greater and much the worst part of the state which he exhibits is owing according to his representation not to accidental and extrinsic mischiefs attendant on the nation but to its radical weakness and constitutional distempers All this however is not without purpose The author is in hopes that when we are fallen into a fanatical terror for the national salvation we shall then be ready to throw ourselves in a sort of precipitate trust some strange disposition of the mind jumbled up of presumption and despair into the hands of the most pretending and forward undertaker One such undertaker at least he has in readiness for our service But let me assure this generous person that however he may succeed in exciting our fears for the public danger he will find it hard indeed to engage us to place any confidence in the system he proposes for our security  HIS undertaking is great The purpose of this pamphlet and at which it aims directly or obliquely in every page is to persuade the public of three or four of the most difficult points in the world that all the advantages of the late war were on the part of the Bourbon alliance that the peace of Paris perfectly consulted the dignity and interest of this country and that the American stampact was a masterpiece of policy and finance that the only good minister this nation has enjoyed since his majesty's accession is the earl of Bute and the only good managers of revenue we have seen are lord Despenser and Mr George Grenville and under the  description of men of virtue and ability he holds them out to us as the only persons fit to put our affairs in order Let not the reader mistake me he does not actually name these persons but having highly applauded their conduct in all its parts and heavily censured every other set of men in the kingdom he then recommends us to his men of virtue and ability  SUCH is the author's scheme Whether it will answer his purpose I know not But surely that purpose ought to be a wonderfully good one to warrant the methods he has taken to compass it If the facts and reasonings in this piece are admitted it is all over with us The continuance of our tranquillity depends upon the compassion of our rivals Unable to secure to ourselves the advantages of peace we are at the same time utterly unfit for war It is impossible if this state of things be credited abroad that we can have any alliance all nations will fly from so dangerous a connexion lest instead of being partakers of our strength they should only become sharers in our ruin If it is believed at home all that firmness of mind and dignified national courage which used to be the great support of this isle against the powers of the world must melt away and fail within us  IN such a state of things can it be amiss if I aim at holding out some comfort to the nation another sort of comfort indeed than that which this writer provides for it a comfort not from its physician but from its constitution if I attempt to shew that all the arguments upon which he founds the decay of that constitution and the necessity of that physician are vain and frivolous I will follow the author closely in his own long career through the war the peace the finances our trade and our foreign politics not for the sake of the particular measures which he discusses that can be of no use they are  all decided their good is all enjoyed or their evil incurred but for the sake of the principles of war peace trade and finances These principles are of infinite moment They must come again and again under consideration and it imports the public of all things that those of its minister be enlarged and just and well confirmed upon all these subjects What notions this author entertains we shall see presently notions in my opinion very irrational and extremely dangerous and which if they should crawl from pamphlets into counsels and be realized from private speculation into national measures cannot fail of hastening and compleating our ruin  THIS author after having paid his compliment to the shewy appearances of the late war in our favour is in the utmost haste to tell you that these appearances were  fallacious  that they were no more than an  imposition  I fear I must trouble the reader with a pretty long quotation in order to set before him the more clearly this author's peculiar way of conceiving and reasoning  "HAPPILY the K was then advised by ministers who did not suffer themselves to be dazzled by the glare of brilliant appearances but knowing them to be  fallacious  they wisely resolved to profit of their splendor before our enemies should also  discover the imposition  The increase in the exports was found to have been occasioned chiefly by the demands of  our own fleets and armies  and instead of bringing wealth to the nation were to be paid for by oppressive taxes upon the people of England While the British seamen were consuming on board our men of war and privateers foreign ships and foreign seamen were employed in the transportation of our merchandize and the carrying trade so great a source of wealth and marine  was entirely engrossed by the neutral nations  The number of British ships annually arriving in  our ports was reduced sail containing tons on a medium of the six years war compared with the six years of peace preceding itThe conquest of the Havannah had indeed stopped the remittance of specie from Mexico to Spain but it had not enabled England to seize it on the contrary our merchants suffered by the detention of the galleons as their  correspondents in Spain were disabled from paying them for their goods sent to America The loss of the trade to Old Spain was a farther bar to an influx of specie  and the attempt upon Portugal had not only deprived us of an import of bullion from thence but the payment of our troops employed in its defence was a fresh drain opened for the diminution of our circulating specieThe high premiums given for new loans had sunk the price of the old stock near a third of its original value so that the purchasers had an obligation from the state to repay them with an addition of  per cent  to their capital Every new loan required new taxes to be imposed new taxes must add to the price of our manufactures  and lessen their consumption among foreigners  The decay of our trade must necessarily  occasion a decrease of the public revenue  and a deficiency of our funds must either be made up by fresh taxes which would only add to the calamity or our national credit must be destroyed by shewing the public creditors the inability of the nation to repay them their principal moneyBounties had already been given for recruits which exceeded the year's wages of the plowman and reaper and as these were exhausted and  husbandry stood still for want of hands  the manufacturers were next to be tempted to quit the anvil and the loom by higher offers  France bankrupt France had no such calamities impending over her her distresses were great but they were immediate and temporary her want of credit preserved her from a great increase of debt and  the loss of her ultramarine dominions lessened her expences Her colonies had indeed put themselves into the hands of the English but the property of her subjects had been preserved by capitulations and a way opened for making her those remittances which the war had before suspended with as much security as in time of peace  Her armies in Germany had been hitherto prevented from seizing upon Hanover but they continued to encamp on the same ground on which the first battle was fought and as it must ever happen from the policy of that government  the last troops she sent into the field were always found to be the best and her frequent losses only served to fill her regiments with better soldiers The conquest of Hanover became therefore every campaign more probable  It is to be noted that the French troops received subsistance only for the last three years of the war and that although large arrears were due to them at its conclusion the charge was the less during its continuance"  P  IF any one be willing to see to how much greater lengths the author carries these ideas he will recur to the book This is sufficient for a specimen of his manner of thinking I believe one reflection uniformly obtrudes itself upon every reader of these paragraphs For what purpose in any cause shall we hereafter contend with France can we ever flatter ourselves that we shall wage a more successful war if on our part in a war the most prosperous we ever carried on by sea and by land and in every part of the globe attended with the unparalleled circumstance of an immense increase of trade and augmentation of revenue if a continued series of disappointments disgraces and defeats followed by public bankruptcy on the part of France if all these still leave her a gainer on the whole balance will it not be downright phrenzy in us ever  to look her in the face again or to contend with her any even the most essential points since victory and defeat though by different ways equally conduct us to our ru  n Subjection to France without a struggle will indeed be less for our honour but on every principle of our author it must be more for our advantage According to his representation of things the question is only concerning the most easy fall France had not discovered our statesman tells us at the end of that war the triumphs of defeat and the resources which are derived from bankruptcy For my poor part I do not wonder at their blindness But the English ministers saw further Our author has at length let foreigners also into the secret and made them altogether as wise as ourselves It is their own fault if  vulgato imperii arcano  they are imposed upon any longer They now are apprized of the sentiments which the great candidate for the government of this great empire entertains and they will act accordingly They are taught our weakness and their own advantages  HE tells the world  P  that if France carries on the war against us in Germany every loss she sustains contributes to the atchievement of her conquest If her armies are three years unpaid she is the less exhausted by expence If her credit is destroyed she is the less oppressed with debt If her troops are cut to pieces they will by her policy and a wonderful policy it is be improved and will be supplied with much better men If the war is carried on in the colonies he tells them that the loss of her ultramarine dominions lessens her expences  P  and ensures her remittances  Per damna per caedes ab ipso  Ducit opes animumque ferro  if so what is it we can do to hurt herIt will  be all an  imposition  all  fallacious  Why the result must be  Occidit occidit spes omnis fortuna nostri nominis    THE only way which the author's principles leave for our escape is to reverse our condition into that of France and to take her losing cards into our hands But though his principles drive him to it his politics will not suffer him to walk on this ground Talking at our ease and of other countries we may bear to be diverted with such speculations but in England we shall never be taught to look upon the annihilation of our trade the ruin of our credit the defeat of our armies and the loss of our ultramarine dominions whatever the author may think of them to be the high road to prosperity and greatness  THE reader does not I hope imagine that I mean seriously to set about the refutation of these uningenious paradoxes and reveries without imagination I state them only that we may discern a little in the questions of war and peace the most weighty of all questions what is the wisdom of those men who are held out to us as the only hope of an expiring nation The present ministry is indeed of a strange character at once indolent and distracted But if a ministerial system should be formed actuated by such maxims as are avowed in this piece the vices of the present ministry would become their virtues their indolence would be the greatest of all public benefits and a distraction that entirely defeated every one of their schemes would be our only security from destruction  TO have stated these reasonings is enough I presume to do their business But they are accompanied with facts and records which may seem of a little more weight I trust however that the facts of this author will be as far from  bearing the touchstone as his arguments On a little inquiry they will be found as great an imposition as the successes they are meant to depreciate for they are all either false or fallaciously applied or not in the least to the purpose for which they are produced  FIRST the author in order to support his favourite paradox that our possession of the French colonies was of no detriment to France has thought proper to inform us that  "they put themselves into the hands of the English"  P  He uses the same assertion in nearly the same words in another place  "her colonies had put themselves into our hands"  P  Now in justice not only to fact and common sense but to the incomparable valour and perseverance of our military and naval forces thus unhandsomely traduced I must tell this author that the French colonies did not  "put themselves into the hands of the English"  They were compelled to submit they were subdued by dint of English valour Will the five years war carried on in Canada in which fell one of the principal hopes of this nation and all the battles lost and gained during that anxious period convince this author of his mistake Let him inquire of Sir Jeffery Amherst under whose conduct that war was carried on of Sir Charles Saunders whose steadiness and presence of mind saved our fleet and were so eminently serviceable in the whole course of the siege of Quebec of general Monckton who was shot through the body there whether France  "put her colonies into the hands of the English"  THOUGH he has made no exception yet I would be liberal to him perhaps he means to confine himself to her colonies in the West Indies But surely it will fare as ill with him there as in North America whilst we remember that in our first  attempt at Martinico we were actually defeated that it was three months before we reduced Guadaloupe and that the conquest of the Havannah was atchieved by the highest conduct aided by circumstances of the greatest goodfortune He knows the expence both of men and treasure at which we bought that place However if it had so pleased the peacemakers it was no dear purchase for it was decisive of the fortune of the war and the terms of the treaty the duke of Nivernois thought so France England Europe considered it in that light all the world except the then friends of the then ministry who wept for our victories and were in haste to get rid of the burthen of our conquests This author knows that France did not put those colonies into the hands of England but he well knows who did put the most valuable of them into the hands of France  IN the next place  P  our author is pleased to consider the conquest of those colonies in no other light than as a convenience for the remittances to France which he asserts that the war had before suspended but for which a way was opened by our conquest as secure as in time of peace I charitably hope he knows nothing of the subject I referred him lately to our commanders for the resistance of the French colonies I now wish he would apply to our customhouse entries and our merchants for the advantages which we derived from them  IN there was no entry of goods from any of the conquered places but Guadaloupe in that year it stood thus        £  Imports from Guadaloupe  value    In when we had not yet delivered up our conquests the account was        Guadaloupe       Martinico       Total imports in  value £    In after we had delivered up the sovereignty of these islands but kept open a communication with them the imports were     £  Guadaloupe       Martinico       Havannah       Total imports in  value £    Besides I find in the account of bullion imported and brought to the bank that during that period in which the intercourse with the Havannah was open we received at that one shop in treasure from that one place £ in the year £ so that the import from these places in that year amounted to £  ON this state the reader will observe that I take the imports from and not the exports to these conquests as the measure of the advantages which we derived from them I do so for reasons which will be somewhat worthy the attention of such readers as are  fond of this species of inquiry I say therefore I choose the import article as the best and indeed the only standard we can have of the value of the West India trade Our export entry does not comprehend the greatest trade we carry on with any of the West India islands the sale of negroes nor does it give any idea of two other advantages we draw from them the remittances for money spent here and the payment of part of the balance of the North American trade It is therefore quite ridiculous to strike a balance merely on the face of an excess of imports and exports in that commerce though in most foreign branches it is on the whole the best method If she should take that standard it would appear that the balance with our own islands is annually several hundred thousand pounds against this country        £  Total imports from the West Indies in       Exports to ditto in ditto       Excess of imports  £    In this which is the common way of stating the balance it will appear upwards of two millions against us which is ridiculous  Such is its aspect on the customhouse entries but we know the direct contrary to be the fact We know that the West Indians are always indebted to our merchants and that the value of every shilling of West India produce is English property So that our import from them and not our export ought always to be considered as their true value and this corrective ought to be applied to all general balances of our trade which are formed on the ordinary principles  IF possible this was more emphatically true of the French West India islands whilst they continued in our hands That none or only a very contemptible  part of the value of this produce could be remitted to France the author will see perhaps with unwillingness but with the clearest conviction if he considers that in the year  after we had ceased to export  to the isles of Guadaloupe and Martinico and to the Havannah and after the colonies were free to send all their produce to Old France and Spain if they had any remittance to make he will see that we imported from those places in that year to the amount of £ So far was the whole annual produce of these islands from being adequate to the payments of their annual call upon us that this mighty additional importation was necessary though not quite sufficient to discharge the debts contracted in the few years we held them The property therefore of their whole produce was ours not only during the war but even for more than a year after the peace The author I hope will not again venture upon so rash and discouraging a proposition concerning the nature and effect of those conquests as to call them a convenience to the remittances of France he sees by this account that what he asserts is not only without foundation but even impossible to be true  AS to our trade at that time he labours with all his might to represent it as absolutely ruined or on the very edge of ruin Indeed as usual with him he is often as equivocal in his expression as he is clear in his design Sometimes he more than insinuates a decay of our commerce in that war sometimes he admits an encrease of exports but it is in order to depreciate the advantages we might appear to derive from that encrease whenever it should come to be proved against him He tells you  P  "that it was chiefly occasioned by the demands of our own fleets and armies and instead of bringing wealth to the nation were to  be paid for by oppressive taxes upon the people of England"  Never was any thing more destitute of foundation It might be proved with the greatest ease from the nature and quality of the goods exported as well as from the situation of the places to which our merchandise was sent and which the war could no wise effect that the supply of our fleets and armies could not have been the cause of this wonderful encrease of trade its cause was evident to the whole world the ruin of the trade of France and our possession of her colonies What wonderful effects this cause produced the reader will see below          £  s  d  Total export of British goods  value        Ditto of foreign goods in time           Ditto of ditto out of time           Total exports of all kinds           Total imports           Balance in favour of England  £                £  s  d  Total exports of British goods           Ditto of foreign goods in time           Ditto of ditto out of time           Total exports of all kinds           Total imports           Balance in favour of England  £        Here is the state of our trade in compared with a very good year of profound peace both are taken from the authentic entries at the customhouse How the author can contrive to make this encrease of the export of English produce agree with his account of the dreadful want of hands in England p unless he supposes manufactures to be made without hands I really do not see It is painful to be so frequently obliged to set this author right in matters of fact This state will fully refute all that he has said or insinuated upon the difficulties and decay of our trade p and  and he will form on that account some judgment of the author's candour or information  ADMIT however that a great part of our export though nothing is more remote from fact was owing to the supply of our fleets and armies was it not somethingwas it not peculiarly fortunate for a nation that she was able from her own bosom to contribute largely to the supply of her armies militating in so many distant countries The author allows that France did not enjoy the same advantages But it is remarkable throughout his whole book that those circumstances which have ever been considered as great benefits and decisive proofs of national superiority are when in our hands taken either in diminution of some other apparent advantage or even sometimes as positive misfortunes The optics of that politician must be of a strange conformation who beholds every thing in this distorted shape  SO far as to our trade With regard to our navigation he is still more uneasy at our situation and still more fallacious in his state of it In his text he affirms it  "to have been  entirely  engrossed by the neutral nations"  P See also p  This he asserts roundly and boldly and without the least concern although it cost no more than a single glance of the eye upon his own margin to see the full refutation of this assertion His own account proves against him that in the year the British shipping amounted to tonsthe foreign to no more than The medium of his six years British tonsforeign only  This state his own demonstrates that the neutral nations did not  entirely engross our navigation    I AM willing from a strain of candour to admit that this author speaks at random that he is only slovenly and inaccurate and not fallacious In matters of account however this want of care is not excusable and the difference between neutral nations entirely engrossing our navigation and being only subsidiary to a vastly augmented trade makes a most material difference to his argument From that principle of fairness though the author speaks otherwise I am willing to suppose he means no more than that our navigation had so declined as to alarm us with the probable loss of this valuable object I shall however shew that his whole proposition whatever modifications he may please to give it is without foundation that our navigation was not decreased that on the contrary it was greatly encreased in the war that it was encreased by the war and that it was probable the same cause would continue to augment it to a still greater height to what an height it is hard to say had our success continued  BUT first I must observe I am much less solicitous whether his fact be true or no than whether his principle is well established Cases are dead things principles are living and productive I then affirm that if in time of war our trade had the good fortune to encrease and at the same time a large nay the largest proportion of carriage had been engrossed by neutral nations it ought not in itself to have been considered as a circumstance of distress War is a time of inconvenience to trade in general it must be straitened and must find its way as it can It is often happy for nations that they are able to call in neutral navigation They all aim at it France endeavoured at it but could not compass  it Will this author say that in a war with Spain such an assistance would not be of absolute necessity that it would not be the most gross of all follies to refuse it  IN the next place his method of stating a medium of six years of war and six years of peace to decide this question is altogether unfair To say in derogation of the advantages of a war that navigation is not equal to what it was in time of peace is what hitherto has never been heard of No war ever bore that test but the war which he so bitterly laments One may lay it down as a maxim that an average estimate of an object in a steady course of rising or of falling must in its nature be an unfair one more particularly if the cause of the rise or fall be visible and its continuance in any degree probable Average estimates are never just but when the object fluctuates and no reason can be assigned why it should not continue still to fluctuate The author chuses to allow nothing at all for this he has taken an average of six years of the war He knew for every body knows that the first three years were on the whole rather unsuccessful and that in consequence of this ill success trade sunk and navigation declined with it but  that grand delusion  of the three last years turned the scale in our favour At the beginning of that war as in the commencement of every war traders were struck with a sort of panic Many went out of the freighting business But by degrees as the war continued the terror wore off the danger came to be better appreciated and better provided against our trade was carried on in large fleets under regular convoys and with great safety The freighting business revived The ships were fewer but much larger and though the number decreased the tonnage was vastly augmented in so much that in  the  British  shipping had risen by the author's own account tonsIn the last year he has given us of the peace it amountd to no more than that is in the last year of the war it was tons more than in the correspondent year of his peace average No year of the peace exceeded it except one and that but little  THE fair account of the matter is this Our trade had as we have just seen encreased to so astonishing a degree in as to employ British and foreign ships to the amount of tons which is more than we employed in the last year of the peaceThus our trade encreased more than a fifth our British navigation had encreased likewise with this astonishing encrease of trade but was not able to keep pace with it and we added about ton of foreign shipping to the which had been employed in the last year of the peace Whatever happened to our shipping in the former years of the war this would be no true state of the case at the time of the treaty If we had lost something in the beginning we had then recovered and more than recovered all our losses Such is the ground of the doleful complaints of the author that  the carrying trade was wholly engrossed by the neutral nations    I HAVE done fairly and even very moderately in taking this year and not his average as the standard of what might be expected in future had the war continued The author will be compelled to allow it unless he undertakes to shew first that the possession of Canada Martinico Guadaloupe Granada the Havannah the Philippines the whole African trade the whole East India trade and the whole Newfoundland fishery had no certain inevitable tendency to encrease the British shipping unless in the second place he can prove  that those trades were or might by law or indulgence be carried on in foreign vessels and unless thirdly he can demonstrate that the premium of insurance on British ships was rising as the war continued He can prove not one of these points I will shew him a fact more that is mortal to his assertions It is the state of our shipping in The author had his reasons for stopping short at the preceding year It would have appeared had he proceeded farther that our tonnage was in a course of uniform augmentation owing to the freight derived from our foreign conquests and to the perfect security of our navigation from our clear and decided superiority at sea This I say would have appeared from the state of the two years    British  tons    D  o    tons    Foreign  tons    D  o    tons  The two last years of the peace were in no degree equal to these Much of the navigation of was also owing to the war this is manifest from the large part of it employed in the carriage from the ceded islands with which the communication still continued open No such circumstances of glory and advantage ever attended upon a war Too happy will be our lot if we should again be forced into a war to behold any thing that shall resemble them and if we were not then the better for them it is not in the ordinary course of God's providence to mend our condition  IN vain does the author declaim on the high premiums given for the loans during the war His  long note swelled with calculations on that subject even supposing the most inaccurate of all calculations to be just would be entirely thrown away did it not serve to raise a wonderful opinion of his financial skill in those who are not less surprized than edified when with a solemn face and mysterious air they are told that two and two make four For what else do we learn from this note that the more expence is incurred by a nation the more money will be required to defray it that in proportion to the continuance of that expence will be the continuance of borrowing that the encrease of borrowing and the encrease of debt will go hand in hand and lastly that the more money you want the harder it will be to get it and that the scarcity of the commodity will enhance the price Who ever doubted the truth or the insignificance of these propositions what do they prove that war is expensive and peace desirable They contain nothing more than a commonplace against war the easiest of all topics To bring them home to his purpose he ought to have shewn that our enemies had money upon better terms which he has not shewn neither can he I shall speak more fully to this point in another place He ought to have shewn that the money they raised upon whatever terms had procured them a more lucrative return He knows that our expenditure purchased commerce and conquest theirs acquired nothing but defeat and bankruptcy  THUS the author has laid down his ideas on the subject of war Next follow those he entertains on that of peace The treaty of Paris upon the whole has his approbation Indeed if his account of the war be just he might have spared himself all further trouble The rest is drawn on as an  inevitable conclusion  P  If the house of Bourbon had the advantage she must give the law and the peace though it were much worse than it is had still been a good one But as the world is yet  deluded  on the state of that war other arguments are necessary and the author has in my opinion very ill supplied them He tells of many things we have got and of which he has made out a kind of bill This matter may be brought within a very narrow compass if we come to consider the requisites of a good peace under some plain distinct heads I apprehend they may be reduced to these stability indemnification alliance  As to the first the author more than obscurely hints in several places that he thinks the peace not likely to last However he does furnish a security a security in any light I fear but insufficient on his hypothesis  P  surely a very odd one  "By stipulating for the entire possession of the continent says he the restored French islands are become in some measure dependent on the British empire and the good faith of France in observing the treaty is guaranteed by the value at which she estimates their possession"  This author soon grows weary of his principles They seldom last him for two pages together When the advantages of the war were to be depreciated then the loss of the ultramarine colonies lightened the expences of France facilitated her remittances and therefore  her colonists put them into our hands  According to this author's system the actual possession of those colonies ought to give us little or no advantage in the negociation for peace and yet the chance of possessing them on a future occasion gives a perfect security for the preservation of that peace The  P  conquest of the  Havannah if it did not serve Spain rather distressed England says our author  "Our merchants suffered by the detention of the galleons as their correspondents in Spain were disabled from paying them for their goods sent to America"  State of the Nation p  But the molestation which her galleons may suffer from our station in Pensacola gives us advantages for which we were not allowed to credit the nation for the Havannah itself a place surely full as well situated for every external purpose as Pensacola and of more internal benefit than ten thousand Pensacolas  THE author  P  sets very little by conquests I suppose it is because he makes them so very lightly On this subject he speaks with the greatest certainty imaginable We have according to him nothing to do but to go and take possession whenever we think proper of the French and Spanish settlements It were better that he had examined a little what advantage the peace gave us towards the invasion of these colonies which we did not possess before the peace It would not have been amiss if he had consulted the public experience and our commanders concerning the absolute certainty of those conquests on which he is pleased to found our security And if after all he should have discovered them to be so very sure and so very easy he might at least to preserve consistency have looked a few pages back and no unpleasing thing to him listened to himself where he says  P  "that the most successful enterprize could not compensate to the nation for the waste of its people by carrying on war in unhealthy climates"  A position which he repeats again p So that according to himself his security is not worth the suit according to fact he has only a chance God knows what a chance of getting  at it and therefore according to reason the giving up the most valuable of all possessions in hopes to conquer them back under any advantage of situation is the most ridiculous security that ever was imagined for the peace of a nation It is true his friends did not give up Canada they could not give up every thing let us make the most of it We have Canada we know its value We have not the French any longer to fight in North America and from this circumstance we derive considerable advantages But here let me rest a little The author touches upon a string which sounds under his fingers but a tremulous and melancholy note North America was once indeed a great strength to this nation in opportunity of ports in ships in provisions in men We found her a sound an active a vigorous member of the empire I hope by wise management she will again become so But one of our capital present misfortunes is her discontent and disobedience To which of the author's favourites this discontent is owing we all know but too sufficiently It would be a dismal event if this foundation of his security and indeed of all our public strength should in reality become our weakness and if all the powers of this empire which ought to fall with a compacted weight upon the head of our enemies should be dissipated and distracted by a jealous vigilance or by hostile attempts upon one another Ten Canadas cannot restore that security for the peace and for every thing valuable to this country which we have lost along with the affection and the obedience of our colonies He is the wise minister he is the true friend to Britain who shall be able to restore it  TO return to the security for the peace The author tells us that the original great purposes  of the war were more than accomplished by the treaty Surely he has experience and reading enough to know that in the course of a war events may happen that render its original very far from being its principal purpose This original may dwindle by circumstances so as to become not a purpose of the second or even the third magnitude I trust this is so obvious that it will not be necessary to put cases for its illustration In that war as soon as Spain entered into the quarrel the security of North America was no longer the sole nor the foremost object The  family compact  had been I know not how long before in agitation But then it was that we saw produced into daylight and action the most odious and most formidable of all the conspiracies against the liberties of Europe that ever has been framed The war with Spain was the first fruits of that league and a security against that league ought to have been the fundamental point of a pacification with the powers who compose it We had materials in our hands to have constructed that security in such a manner as never to be shaken But how did the virtuous and able men of our author labour for this great end they took no one step towards it On the contrary they countenanced and indeed as far as it depended on them recognized it in all its parts for our plenipotentiary treated with those who acted for the two crowns as if they had been different ministers of the same monarch The Spanish minister received his instructions not from Madrid but from Versailles  THIS was not hid from our ministers at home and the discovery ought to have alarmed them if the good of their country had been the object of their anxiety They could not but have seen that the whole Spanish monarchy was melted down into  the cabinet of Versailles But they thought this circumstance an advantage as it enabled them to go through with their work the more expeditiously Expedition was every thing to them because France might happen during a protracted negotiation to discover the great imposition of our victories  IN the same spirit they negotiated the terms of the peace If it were thought advisable not to take any positive security from Spain the most obvious principles of policy dictated that the burthen of the cessions ought to fall upon France and that every thing which was of grace and favour should be given to Spain Spain could not on her part have executed a capital article in the family compact which obliged her to compensate the losses of France At least she could not do it in America for she was expressly precluded by the treaty of Utrecht from ceding any territory or giving any advantage in trade to that power What did our ministers they took from Spain the territory of Florida an object of no value except to shew our dispositions to be quite equal at least towards both powers and they enabled France to compensate Spain by the gift of Louisiana loading us with all the harshness leaving the act of kindness with France and opening thereby a door to the fulfilling of this the most consolidating article of the family compact Accordingly that dangerous league thus abetted and authorized by the English ministry without an attempt to invalidate it in any way or in any of its parts exists to this hour and has grown stronger and stronger every hour of its existence  AS to the second component of a good peace  compensation  I have but little trouble the author has said nothing upon that head He has nothing  to say After a war of such expence this ought to have been a capital consideration But on what he has been so prudently silent I think it is right to speak plainly All our new acquisitions together at this time scarce afford matter of revenue either at home or abroad sufficient to defray the expence of their establishments not one shilling towards the reduction of our debt Guadaloupe or Martinico alone would have given us material aid much in the way of duties much in the way of trade and navigation A good ministry would have considered how a renewal of the  Assiento  might have been obtained We had as much right to ask it at the treaty of Paris as at the treaty of Utrecht We had incomparably more in our hands to purchase it Floods of treasure would have poured into this kingdom from such a source and under proper management no small part of it would have taken a public direction and have fructified an exhausted exchequer  IF this gentleman's hero of finance instead of flying from a treaty which though he now defends he could not approve and would not oppose if he instead of shifting into an office which removed him from the manufacture of the treaty had by his credit with the then great director acquired for us these or any of these objects the possession of Guadaloupe or Martinique or the renewal of the  Assiento  he might have held his head high in his country because he would have performed real service ten thousand times more real service than all the oeconomy of which this writer is perpetually talking or all the little tricks of finance which the expertest juggler of the treasury can practise could amount to in a thousand years But the occasion is lost the time is gone perhaps for ever  AS to the third requisite  alliance  there too the author is silent What strength of that kind did they acquire they got no one new ally they stript the enemy of not a single old one They disgusted how justly or unjustly matters not every ally we had and from that time to this we stand friendless in Europe But of this naked condition of their country I know some people are not ashamed They have their system of politics our ancestors grew great by another In this manner these virtuous men concluded the peace and their practice is only consonant to their theory  MANY things more might be observed on this curious head of our author's speculations But taking leave of what the writer says in his serious part if he be serious in any part I shall only just point out a piece of his pleasantry No man I believe ever denied that the time for making peace is that in which the best terms may be obtained But what that time is together with the use that has been made of it we are to judge by seeing whether terms adequate to our advantages and to our necessities have been actually obtainedHere is the pinch of the question and to which the author ought to have set his shoulders in earnest Instead of doing this he slips out of the harness by a jest and sneeringly tells us that to determine this point we must know the secrets of the French and Spanish cabinets  Something however has transpired in the quarrels among those concerned in that transaction It seems the  good genius  of Britain so much vaunted by our author did his duty nobly Whilst we were gaining such advantages the court of France was astonished at our concessions  "J'ai apporté à Versailes il est vrai les ratifications du Roi d'Angleterre  à vostre grand étonnement et à celui de bien d'autres  Je dois cela au bontés du Roi d'Angleterre à celles de Milord Bute à Mons le Comte de Viry à Mons le Duc de Nivernois et en fin à mon scavoir faire"  Lettres c du Chev D'Eon p  and that parliament  was pleased to approve the treaty of peace without calling for the correspondence concerning it How just this sarcasm on that parliament may be I say not but how becoming in the author I leave it to his friends to determine  HAVING thus gone through the questions of war and peace the author proceeds to state our debt and the interest which it carried at the time of the treaty with the unfairness and inaccuracy however which distinguish all his assertions and all his calculations To detect every fallacy and rectify every mistake would be endless It will be enough to point out a few of them in order to shew how unsafe it is to place any thing like an implicit trust in such a writer  THE interest of debt contracted during the war is stated by the author at £ The particulars appear in pages and Among them is stated the unfunded debt £ supposed to carry interest on a medium at  per cent  which amounts to £ We are referred to the  Considerations on the Trade and Finances of the Kingdom  p for the particulars of that unfunded debt Turn to the work and to the place referred to by the author himself if you have a mind to see a clear detection of a capital fallacy of this article in his account You will there see that this unfunded debt consists of the nine following articles the remaining subsidy to the duke of Brunswick the remaining  dedommagement  to the landgrave of Hesse the German demands the army and ordnance extraordinaries the deficiencies of grants and funds Mr Touchet's claim the debts due to Nova Scotia and Barbadoes exchequer bills and navy debt The extreme fallacy of this state cannot escape any reader who will be at the pains to compare the interest money with  which he affirms us to have been loaded in his  State of the Nation  with the items of the principal debt to which he refers in his  Considerations  The reader must observe that of this long list of nine articles only two the exchequer bills and part of the navy debt carried any interest at all The first amounted to £ and this undoubtedly carried interest The whole navy debt indeed amounted to £ but of this only a  part  carried interest The author of the  Considerations  c labours to prove this very point in p and Mr G has always defended himself upon the same ground for the insufficient provision he made for the discharge of that debt The reader may see their own authority for it  "The navy bills are not due till six months after they have been issued six months also of the seamens wages by act of parliament must be and in consequence of the rules prescribed by that act twelve months wages generally and often much more are retained and there has been besides at all times a large arrear of pay which though kept in the account could never be claimed the persons to whom it was due having left neither assignees nor representatives The precise amount of such sums cannot be ascertained but they can hardly be reckoned less than or hundred thousand pounds On st Dec when the navy debt was reduced nearly as low as it could be it still amounted to l s ¾d consisting chiefly of articles which could not then be discharged such articles will be larger now in proportion to the encrease of the establishment and an allowance must always be made for them in judging of the state of the navy debt though they are not distinguishable in the account In providing for that which is payable the principal object of the legislature is always to discharge the bills for they are the greatest article they bear an interest of  per cent  and when the quantity of them is large they are a heavy incumbrance upon all money transactions"  MR G did in fact provide no more than £ for the discharge of these bills in two years It is much to be wished that these gentlemen  would lay their heads together that they would consider well this matter and agree upon something For when the scanty provision made for the unfunded debt is to be vindicated then we are told it is a very  small part  of that debt which carries interest But when the public is to be represented in a miserable condition and the consequences of the late war to be laid before us in dreadful colours then we are to be told that the unfunded debt is within a trifle of ten millions and so large a portion of it carries interest that we must not compute less than  per cent  upon the  whole    IN the year parliament voted £ towards the discharge of the navy debt This sum could not be applied solely to the discharge of bills carrying interest because part of the debt due on seamens wages must have been paid and some bills carried no interest at all Notwithstanding this we find by an account in the journals of the H of C in the following session that the navy debt carrying interest was on the st of December no more than £ I am sure therefore that I admit too much when I admit the navy debt carrying interest after the creation of the navy annuities in the year to have been £ Add the exchequer bills and the whole unfunded debt carrying interest will be four millions instead of ten and the annual interest paid for it at  per cent  will be £ instead of £ An error of no small magnitude and which could not have been owing to inadvertency  THE misrepresentation of the encrease of the peace establishment is still more extraordinary than that of the interest on the unfunded debt The encrease is great undoubtedly However the author finds no fault with it and urges it only as a  matter of argument to support the strange chimerical proposals he is to make us in the close of his work for the encrease of revenue The greater he made that establishment the stronger he expected to stand in argument but whatever he expected or proposed he should have stated the matter fairly He tells us that this establishment is near £ more than it was in and other years of peace This he has done in his usual manner by assertion without troubling himself either with proof or probability For he has not given us any state of the peace establishment in the years and the time which he means to compare with the present As I am obliged to force him to that precision from which he always flies as from his most dangerous enemy I have been at the trouble to search the journals in the period between the two last wars and I find that the peace establishment consisting of the navy the ordnance and the several incidental expences amounted to £ Now is this writer wild enough to imagine that the peace establishment of and the subsequent years made up from the same articles is £ and upwards His assertion however goes to this But I must take the liberty of correcting him in this gross mistake and from an authority he cannot refuse from his favourite work and standing authority the Considerations We find there p        £  Navy       Army       Ordnance       The Four American Governments       General Surveys in America       Foundling Hospital       To the African Committee       For the Civil Establishment on the Coast of Africa       Militia       Deficiency of Land and Malt       Deficiency of Funds       Extraordinaries of the Army and Navy          Total £    the peace establishment  of and stated at £ This is near two hundred thousand pounds less than that given in the State of the Nation But even from this in order to render the articles which compose the peace establishment in the two periods correspondent for otherwise they cannot be compared we must deduct first his articles of the deficiency of land and malt which amount to £ They certainly are no part of the establishment nor are they included in that sum which I have stated above for the establishment in the time of the former peace If they were proper to be stated at all they ought to be stated in both accounts We must also deduct the deficiencies of funds £ These deficiencies are the difference between the interest charged on the public for monies borrowed and the produce of the taxes laid for the discharge of that interest Annual provision is indeed to be made for them by parliament but in the enquiry before us which is only what charge is brought on the public by interest paid or to be paid for money borrowed the utmost that the author should do is to bring into the account the full interest for all that money This he has done in p and he repeats it in p the very page I am now examining £ To comprehend afterwards in the peace establishment the deficiency of the fund created for payment of that interest would be laying twice to the account of the war part of the same sum Suppose ten millions borrowed at  per cent  and the fund for payment of the interest to produce no more than £ The whole annual charge on the  public is £ It can be no more But to charge the interest in one part of the account and then the deficiency in the other would be charging £ The deficiency of funds must therefore be also deducted from the peace establishment in the Considerations and then the peace establishment in that author will be reduced to the same articles with those included in the sum I have already mentioned for the peace establishment before the last war in the year and        £  Peace establishment in the Considerations       Deduct deficiency of land and malt       Ditto of funds                       Peace establishment before the late war in which no deficiencies of land and malt or funds are included          Difference £    Being about half the sum which our author has been pleased to suppose it  Let us put the whole together The author states     £  Difference of peace establishment before and since the war       Interest of debt contracted by the war               The  real  difference in the peace establishment is       The actual interest of the funded debt including that charged on the sinking fund       The actual interest of unfunded debt at most       Total interest of debt contracted by the war       Encrease of peace establishment and interest of the new debt          Error of the author £    IT is true the extraordinaries of the army have been found considerably greater than the author of the Considerations was pleased to foretell they would be The author of the Present State avails himself of that encrease and finding it suit his purpose sets the whole down in the peaceestablishment of the present times If this is allowed him his error perhaps may be reduced to £ But I doubt the author of the Considerations will not thank him for admitting £ and upwards as the peaceestablishment for extraordinaries when that author has so much laboured to confine them within £  THESE are some of the capital fallacies of the author To break the thread of my discourse as little as possible I have thrown into the margin many instances though God knows far from the whole of his inaccuracies inconsistencies and want of common care I think myself obliged to take some notice of them in order to take off from any authority this writer may have and to put an end to the deference which careless men are apt to pay to one who boldly arrays his accounts and marshals  his figures in perfect confidence that their correctness will never be examined  Upon the money borrowed in the premium of one  per cent  was for years not for this annuity has been paid eight years instead of seven the sum paid is therefore £ instead of £ the remaining term is worth years and a quarter instead of years  See Smart and Demoivre  its value is £ instead of £ and the whole value of that premium is £ instead of £ The like errors are observable in his computation on the additional capital of three  per cent  on the loan of that year In like manner on the loan of the author computes on five years payments instead of six and says in express terms that take five from and there remains These are not errors of the pen or the press the several computations pursued in this part of the work with great diligence and earnestness prove them errors upon much deliberation Thus the premiums in are cast up £ too little an error in the first rule of arithmetic  "The annuities borrowed in and are" says he "to continue till redeemed by parliament"  He does not take notice that the first are irredeemable till February the other till July In this the amount of the premiums is computed on the time which they have run Weakly and ignorantly for he might have added to this and strengthened his argument such as it is by charging also the value of the additional one  per cent  from the day on which he wrote to at least that day on which these annuities become redeemable To make ample amends however he has added to the premiums of  per cent  in and three  per cent  in the annuity paid for them since their commencement the fallacy of which is manifest for the premiums in these cases can be neither more nor less than the additional capital for which the public stands engaged and is just the same whether five or years annuity has been paid for it In private life no man persuades himself that he has borrowed £ because he happens to have paid years interest on loan of £  HOWEVER for argument I am content to take his state of it The debt was and is enormous The war was expensive The best oeconomy had not perhaps been used But I must observe that war and oeconomy are things not easily reconciled and that the attempt of leaning towards parsimony  in such a state may be the worst management and in the end the worst oeconomy in the world hazarding the total loss of all the charge incurred and of every thing else along with it  BUT  cui bono  all this detail of our debt has the author given a single light towards any material reduction of it Not a glimmering We shall see in its place what sort of thing he proposes But before he commences his operations in order to scare the public imagination he raises by art magic a thick mist before our eyes through which glare the most ghastly and horrible phantoms  Hunc igitur terrorem animi tenebrasque necesse est  Non radii solis neque lucida tela diei  Discutiant sed naturae species ratioque  Let us therefore calmly if we can for the fright into which he has put us appreciate those dreadful and deformed gorgons and hydras which inhabit the joyless regions of an imagination fruitful in nothing but the production of monsters  HIS whole representation is founded on the supposed operation of our debt upon our manufactures and our trade To this cause he attributes a certain supposed dearness of the necessaries of life which must compel our manufacturers to emigrate to cheaper countries particularly to France and with them the manufacture Thence consumption declining and with it revenue He will not permit the real balance of our trade to be estimated so high £ and the interest of the debt to foreigners carries off £ of that balance France is not in the same condition Then follow his wailings and lamentings which he renews over and over according to his customa declining trade and decreasing specieon the point of becoming tributary to Franceof  losing Irelandof having the colonies torn away from us  THE first thing upon which I shall observe is what he takes  P  for granted as the clearest of all propositions the emigration of our manufacturers to France I undertake to say that this assertion is totally groundless and I challenge the author to bring any sort of proof of it If living is cheaper in France that is to be had for less specie wages are proportionably lower No manufacturer let the living be what it will was ever known to fly for refuge to low wages Money is the first thing which attracts him Accordingly our wages attract artificers from all parts of the world From two shillings to one shilling is a fall in all mens imaginations which no calculation upon a difference in the price of the necessaries of life can compensate But it will be hard to prove that a French artificer is better fed cloathed lodged and warmed than one in England for that is the sense and the only sense of living cheaper If in truth and fact our artificer farcs as well in all these respects as one in the same state in Francehow stands the matter in point of opinion and prejudice the springs by which people in that class of life are chiefly actuated The idea of our common people concerning French living is dreadful altogether as dreadful as our author's can possibly be of the state of his own country a way of thinking that will hardly ever prevail on them to desert to France  In a course of years a few manufacturers have been tempted abroad not by cheap living but by immense premiums to set up as masters and to introduce the manufacture This must happen in every country eminent for the skill of its artificers and has nothing to do with taxes and the price of provisions  BUT leaving the author's speculations the fact is that they have not deserted and of course the manufacture cannot be departed or departing with them I am not indeed able to get at all the details of all our manufactures though I think I have taken full as much pains for that purpose as our author Some I have by me and they do not hitherto thank God support the author's complaint unless a vast encrease of the quantity of goods manufactured be a proof of losing the manufacture On a view of the registers in the Westriding of Yorkshire for three years before the war and for the three last it appears that the quantities of cloths entered were as follow     Pieces broad     Pieces narrow                                          Pieces broad     Pieces narrow                             years ending         years ending         Encrease    Encrease    IN this manner this capital branch of manufacture has encreased under the encrease of taxes and this not from a declining but from a greatly flourishing period of commerce I may say the  same on the best authority of the fabric of thin goods at Halifax of the bays at Rochdale and of that infinite variety of admirable manufactures that grow and extend every year among the spirited inventive and enterprizing traders of Manchester  A TRADE sometimes seems to perish when it only assumes a different form Thus the coarsest woollens were formerly exported in great quantities to Russia The Russians now supply themselves with these goods But the export thither of finer cloths has encreased in proportion as the other has declined Possibly some parts of the kingdom may have felt something like a languor in business Objects like trade and manufacture which the very attempt to confine would certainly destroy frequently change their place and thereby far from being lost are often highly improved Thus some manufactures have decayed in the west and south which have made new and more vigorous shoots when transplanted into the north And here it is impossible to pass by though the author has said nothing upon it the vast addition to the mass of British trade which has been made by the improvement of Scotland What does he think of the commerce of the city of Glasgow and of the manufactures of Paisley and all the adjacent county has this any thing like the deadly aspect and  facies Hippocratica  which the false diagnostic of our state physician has given to our trade in general has he not heard of the iron works of such magnitude even in their cradle which are set up on the Carron and which at the same time have drawn nothing from Sheffield Birmingham or Wolverhampton  THIS might perhaps be enough to shew the entire falsity of the complaint concerning the decline of our manufactures But every step we advance  this matter clears up more and more and the false terrors of the author are dissipated and fade away as the light appears  "The trade and manufactures of this country says he going to ruin and a diminution of our  revenue from consumption  must attend the loss of so many seamen and artificers"  Nothing more true than the general observation nothing more false than its application to our circumstances Let the revenue on consumption speak for itself        £  Average of net excise since the new duties three years ending       Ditto before the new duties three years ending          Average encrease £    Here is no diminution Here is on the contrary an immense encrease This is owing I shall be told to the new duties which may encrease the total bulk but at the same time may make some diminution of the produce of the old Were this the fact it would be far from supporting the author's complaint It might have proved that the burthen lay rather too heavy but it would never prove that the  revenue from consumption  was impaired which it was his business to do But what is the real fact Let us take as the best instance for the purpose the produce of the old hereditary and temporary excise granted in the reign of Charles the second whose object is that of most of the new impositions from two averages each of eight years        £  Average first period eight years ending       Ditto second period eight years ending          Encrease £    I have taken these averages as including in each a war and a peace period the first before the imposition of the new duties the other since those impositions and such is the state of the oldest branch of the revenue from consumption Besides the acquisition of so much new this article to speak of no other has rather encreased under the pressure of all those additional taxes to which the author is pleased to attribute its destruction But as the author has made his grand effort against those moderate judicious and necessary levies which support all the dignity the credit and the power of his country the reader will excuse a little further detail on this subject that we may see how little oppressive those taxes are on the shoulders of the public with which he labours so earnestly to load its imagination For this purpose we take the state of that specific article upon which the two capital burthens of the war leaned the most immediately by the additional duties on malt and upon beer  Average of strong beer brewed in eight years before the additional malt and beer duties     Bar  Average of strong beer eight years since the duties     Bar     Encrease in the last period  Bar  Here is the effect of two such daring taxes as d by the bushel additional on malt and s by the barrel additional on beer Two impositions laid without remission one upon the neck of the other and laid upon an object which before had been immensely loaded They did not in the least impair the consumption it has grown under them It appears that upon the whole the people did not feel so much inconvenience from the new duties as to oblige them to take refuge in the private brewery Quite the contrary happened in both these respects in the reign of king William and it happened from much slighter impositions  Although the public brewery has considerably encreased in this latter period the produce of the malt tax has been something less than in the former this cannot be attributed to the new malt tax Had this been the cause of the lessened consumption the public brewery so much more burthened must have felt it more The cause of this diminution of the malt tax I take to have been principally owing to the greater dearness of corn in the second period than the first which in all its consequences affected the people in the country much more than those in the towns But the revenue from consumption was not on the whole impaired as we have seen in the foregoing page  No people can long consume a commodity for which they are not well able to pay An enlightened reader laughs at the inconsistent chimera of our author of a people universally luxurious and at the same time oppressed with taxes and declining in trade For my part I cannot look on these duties as the author does He sees nothing but the burthen I can perceive the burthen as well as he but I cannot avoid contemplating also the strength that supports it From thence I draw the most comfortable assurances of the future vigour and the ample resources of this great misrepresented country and can never prevail on myself to make complaints which have no cause in order to raise hopes which have no foundation  WHEN a representation is built on truth and nature one member supports the other and mutual lights are given and received from every part Thus as our manufacturers have not deserted nor the manufacture left us nor the consumption declined nor the revenue sunk so neither has trade which is at once the result measure and cause of the whole in the least decayed as our author has thought proper sometimes to affirm constantly to suppose as if it were the most indisputable of all propositions The reader will see below the comparative state of our trade in three of the best years before our encrease of debt and taxes and with it the three last years since the author's date of our ruin     Total imports value £  Exports ditto £                                      Total  £                          Exports exceed imports          Medium balance  £          £     £                                      Total  £                          Exports exceed       Medium balance for three last years  £    IN the last three years the whole of our exports was between and millions In the three years preceding the war it was no more than from  to millions The average balance of the former period was £ of the latter something above four millions It is true that whilst the impressions of the author's destructive war continued our trade was greater than it is at present One of the necessary consequences of the peace was that France must gradually recover a part of those markets of which she had been originally in possession However after all these deductions still the gross trade in the worst year of the present is better than in the best year of any former period of peace A very great part of our taxes if not the greatest has been imposed since the beginning of this century On the author's principles this continual encrease of taxes must have ruined our trade or at least entirely checked its growth But I have a manuscript of Davenant which contains an abstract of our trade for the years and by which it appears that the whole export from England did not then exceed £ It is now considerably more than double that amount Yet England was then a rich and flourishing nation  THE author endeavours to derogate from the balance in our favour as it stands on the entries and reduces it from four millions as it there appears to no more than £ His observation on the looseness and inaccuracy of the export entries is just and that the error is always an error of excess I readily admit But because as usual he has wholly omitted some very material facts his conclusion is as erroneous as the entries he complains of  ON this point of the customhouse entries I shall make a few observations st The inaccuracy of these entries can extend only to FREE GOODS that is to such British products and manufactures  as are exported without drawback and without bounty which do not in general amount to more than twothirds at the very utmost of the whole export even of  our home products  The valuable articles of corn malt leather hops beer and many others do not come under this objection of inaccuracy The article of CERTIFICATE GOODS reexported a vast branch of our commerce admits of no error except some smaller frauds which cannot be estimated as they have all a drawback of duty and the exporter must therefore correctly specify their quantity and kind The author therefore is not warranted from the known error in some of the entries to make a general defalcation from the whole balance in our favour This error cannot affect more than half if so much of the export article dly In the account made up at the inspector general's office they estimate only the original cost of British products as they are here purchased and on foreign goods only the prices in the country from whence they are sent This was the method established by Mr Davenant and as far as it goes it certainly is a good one But the profits of the merchant at home and of our factories abroad are not taken into the account which profit on such an immense quantity of goods exported and reexported cannot fail of being very great five  per cent  upon the whole I should think a very moderate allowance dly It does not comprehend the advantage arising from the employment of tons of shipping which must be paid by the foreign consumer and which in many bulky articles of commerce is equal to the value of the commodity This can scarcely be rated at less than a million annually thly The whole import from Ireland and America and from the West Indies is set against us in the ordinary way of striking a balance of imports  and exports whereas the import and export are both our own This is just as ridiculous as to put against the general balance of the nation how much more goods Cheshire receives from London than London from Cheshire The whole revolves and circulates through this kingdom and is so far as it regards our profit in the nature of home trade as much as if the several countries of America and Ireland were all pieced to Cornwall The course of exchange with all these places is fully sufficient to demonstrate that this kingdom has the whole advantage of their commerce When the final profit upon a whole system of trade rests and centers in a certain place a balance struck in that place merely on the mutual sale of commodities is quite fallacious thly The customhouse entries furnish a most defective and indeed ridiculous idea of the most valuable branch of trade we have in the world that with Newfoundland Observe what you export thither a little spirits provision fishing lines and fishing hooks Is the  export  the true idea of the Newfoundland trade in the light of a beneficial branch of commerce nothing less Examine our imports from thence it seems upon this vulgar idea of exports and imports to turn the balance against you But your exports to Newfoundland are your own goods Your import is your own food as much your own as that you raise with your ploughs out of your own soil and not your loss but your gain your riches not your poverty But so fallacious is this way of judging that neither the export nor import nor both together supply any idea approaching to adequate of that branch of business The vessels in that trade go strait from Newfoundland to the foreign market and the sale there not the import here is the measure of its value That trade which is one of your greatest and best is hardly so  much as seen in the customhouse entries and it is not of less annual value to this nation than  £  thly The quality of your imports must be considered as well as the quantity To state the whole of the foreign import  as loss  is exceedingly absurd All the iron hemp flax cotton Spanish wool raw silk woollen and linen yarn which we import are by no means to be considered as the matter of a merely luxurious consumption which is the idea too generally and loosely annexed to our import article These abovementioned are materials of industry not of luxury which are wrought up here in many instances to ten times and more of their original value Even where they are not subservient to our exports they still add to our internal wealth which consists in the stock of useful commodities as much as in gold and silver In looking over the specific articles of our export and import I have often been astonished to see for how small a part of the supply of our consumption either luxurious or convenient we are indebted to nations properly foreign to us  THESE considerations are entirely passed over by the author they have been but too much neglected by most who have speculated on this subject But they ought never to be omitted by those who mean to come to any thing like the true state of the British trade They compensate and they more than compensate every thing which the author can cut off with any appearance of reason for the overentry of British goods and they restore to us that balance of four millions which the author has thought proper on such a very poor and limited comprehension of the object to reduce to  £    IN general this author is so circumstanced that to support his theory he is obliged to assume his  facts and then if you allow his facts they will not support his conclusions What if all he says of the state of this balance were true did not the same objections always lie to customhouse entries do they defalcate more from the entries of than from those of If they prove us ruined we were always ruined Some ravens have always indeed croaked out this kind of song They have a malignant delight in presaging mischief when they are not employed in doing it they are miserable and disappointed at every instance of the public prosperity They overlook us like the malevolent being of the poet  Tritonida conspicit arcem  Ingeniis opibusque et festa pace virentem  Vixque tenet lacrymas quia nil lacrymabile cernit  IT is in this spirit that some have looked upon those accidents that cast an occasional damp upon trade Their imaginations entail these accidents upon us in perpetuity We have had some bad harvests This must very disadvantageously affect the balance of trade and the navigation of a people so large a part of whose commerce is in grain But in knowing the cause we are morally certain that according to the course of events it cannot long subsist In the three last years we have exported scarcely any grain in good years that export hath been worth twelve hundred thousand pounds and more in the two last years far from exporting we have been obliged to import to the amount perhaps of our former exportation So that in this article the balance must be  £  against us that is one million in the ceasing of gain the other in the encrease of expenditure But none of the author's promises or projects could have prevented this misfortune and thank God we do not want him or them to relieve us from it  although if his friends should now come into power I doubt not but they will be ready to take credit for any encrease of trade or excise that may arise from the happy circumstance of a good harvest  THIS connects with his loud laments and melancholy prognostications concerning the high price of the necessaries of life and the products of labour With all his others I deny this fact and I again call upon him to prove it Take average and not accident the grand and first necessary of life is cheap in this country and that too as weighed not against labour which is its true counterpoise but against money Does he call the price of wheat at this day between and shillings  per  quarter in London dear  It is dearer in some places and rather cheaper in others but it must soon all come to a level  He must know that fuel an object of the highest order in the necessaries of life and of the first necessity in almost every kind of manufacture is in many of our provinces cheaper than in any part of the globe Meat is on the whole not excessively dear whatever its price may be at particular times and from particular accidents If it has had any thing like an uniform rise this enhancement may easily be proved not to be owing to the encrease of taxes but to uniform encrease of consumption and of money Diminish the latter and meat in your markets will be sufficiently cheap in account but much dearer in effect because fewer will be in a condition to buy Thus your apparent plenty will be real indigence At present even under temporary disadvantages the use of flesh is greater here than any where else it is continued without any interruption of Lents or meagre days it is sustained and growing even with the encrease of our taxes But some have the art of converting  even the signs of national prosperity into symptoms of decay and ruin And our author who so loudly disclaims popularity never fails to lay hold of the most vulgar popular prejudices and humours in hopes to captivate the croud Even those peevish dispositions which grow out of some transitory suffering those passing clouds which float in our changeable atmosphere are by him industriously figured into frightful shapes in order first to terrify and then to govern the populace  IT was not enough for the author's purpose to give this false and discouraging picture of the state of his own country It did not fully answer his end to exaggerate her burthens to depreciate her successes and to vilify her character Nothing had been done unless the situation of France were exalted in proportion as that of England had been abased The reader will excuse the citation I make at length from his book he outdoes himself upon this occasion His confidence is indeed unparalleled and altogether of the heroic cast  "IF our rival nations were in the same circumstances with ourselves the  augmentation of our taxes would produce no ill consequences  if we were obliged to raise our prices they must from the same causes do the like and could take no advantage by underselling and underworking us But the alarming consideration to Great Britain is  that France is not in the same condition  Her distresses during the war were great but they were immediate her want of credit as has been said compelled her to impoverish her people by raising the greatest part of her supplies within the year  but the burdens she imposed on them were in a great measure temporary and must be greatly diminished by a few years of peace  She could procure no considerable loans therefore  she has mortgaged no  such oppressive taxes as those Great Britain has imposed in perpetuity for payment of interest  Peace must therefore soon reestablish her commerce and manufactures especially as the comparative  lightness of taxes  and the cheapness of living in that country must make France an asylum for British manufacturers and artificers"  On this the author rests the merits of his whole system And on this point I will join issue with him If France is not at least in the  same condition  even in that very condition which the author falsely represents to be ours if the very reverse of his proposition be not true then I will admit his State of the Nation to be just and all his inferences from that state to be logical and conclusive It is not surprizing that the author should hazard our opinion of his veracity That is a virtue on which great statesmen do not perhaps pique themselves so much but it is somewhat extraordinary that he should stake on a very poor calculation of chances all credit for care for accuracy and for knowledge of the subject of which he treats He is rash and inaccurate because he thinks he writes to a public ignorant and inattentive But he may find himself in that respect as in many others greatly mistaken  IN order to contrast the light and vigorous condition of France with that of England weak and sinking under her burthens he states in his th page that France had raised £ sterling  by taxes within the several years  from the year to both inclusive An Englishman must stand aghast at such a representation to find France able to  raise within the year  sums little inferior to all that we were able even to  borrow  on interest with all the resources of the greatest and most established credit in the world Europe was filled with astonishment  when they saw England  borrow  in one year twelve millions It was thought and very justly no small proof of national strength and financial skill to find a fund for the payment of the interest upon this sum The interest of this computed with the one  per cent  annuities amounted only to £ a year This I say was thought a surprising effort even of credit But this author talks as of a thing not worth proving and but just worth observing that France in one year raised sixteen times that sum without borrowing and continued to raise sums not far from equal to it for several years together Suppose some Jacob Henriques had proposed in the year to prevent a perpetual charge on the nation by raising ten millions within the year He would have been considered not as a harsh financier who laid an heavy hand on the public but as a poor visionary who had run mad on supplies and taxes They who know that the whole land tax of England at s in the pound raises but two millions will not easily apprehend that any such sums as the author has conjured up can be raised even in the most opulent nations France owed a large debt and was incumbered with heavy establishments before that war The author does not formally deny that she borrowed something in every year of its continuance let him produce the funds for this astonishing annual addition to all her vast preceding taxes an addition equal to the whole excise customs land and malt taxes of England taken together  BUT what must be the reader's astonishment perhaps his indignation if he should find that this great financier has fallen into the most unaccountable of all errors no less an error than that of mistaking the  identical sums borrowed by France upon interest for supplies raised within the year  Can it  be conceived that any man only entered into the first rudiments of finance should make so egregious a blunder should write it should print it should carry it to a second edition should take it not collaterally and incidentally but lay it down as the corner stone of his whole system in such an important point as the comparative states of France and England But it will be said that it was his misfortune to be ill informed Not at all A man of any loose general knowledge and of the most ordinary sagacity never could have been misinformed in so gross a manner because he would have immediately rejected so wild and extravagant an account  THE fact is this the credit of France bad as it might have been did enable her not to raise within the year but to  borrow  the very sums the author mentions that is to say livres making in the author's computation  £  The credit of France was low but it was not annihilated She did not derive as our author chooses to assert any advantages from the debility of her credit Its consequence was the natural one she borrowed but she borrowed upon bad terms indeed on the most exorbitant usury  IN speaking of a foreign revenue the very pretence to accuracy would be the most inaccurate thing in the world Neither the author nor I can with certainty authenticate the information we communicate to the public nor in an affair of eternal fluctuation arrive at perfect exactness All we can do and this we may be expected to do is to avoid gross errors and blunders of a capital nature We cannot order the proper officer to lay the accounts before the house But the reader must judge on the probability of the accounts we lay before him The author speaks of France as raising her supplies  for war by taxes within the year and of her debt as a thing scarcely worthy of notice I affirm that she borrowed large sums in every year and has thereby accumulated an immense debt This debt continued after the war infinitely to embarrass her affairs and to find some means for its reduction was then and has ever since been the first object of her policy But she has so little succeeded in all her efforts that the  perpetual  debt of France is at this hour little short of  £  sterling and she stands charged with at least of English pounds on liferents and tontines The annuities paid at this day at the hotel de Ville of Paris which are by no means her sole payments of that nature amount to of livres that is to pounds besides  billets au porteur  and various detached and unfunded debts to a great amount and which bear an interest  AT the end of the war the interest payable on her debt amounted to upwards of seven millions sterling M de la Verdy the last hope of the French finances was called in to aid in the reduction of an interest so light to our author so intolerably heavy upon those who are to pay it After many unsuccessful efforts towards reconciling arbitrary reduction with public credit he was obliged to go the plain high road of power and to impose a tax of  per cent  upon a very great part of the capital debt of that kingdom and this measure of present ease to the destruction of future credit produced about £ a year which was carried to their  caisse d'amortissement  or sinking fund But so unfaithfully and unsteadily has this and all the other articles which compose that fund been applied to their purposes that they have given the state but very little even of present relief since it is known to the whole world that she is behindhand  on every one of her establishments Since the year there has been no operation of any consequence on the French finances and in this enviable condition is France at present with regard to her debt  EVERY body knows that the principal of the debt is but a name the interest is the only thing which can distress a nation Take this idea which will not be disputed and compare the interest paid by England with that paid by France        £  Interest paid by France funded and unfunded for perpetuity or on lives after the tax of  per cent       Interest paid by England as stated by the author p       Interest paid by France exceeds that paid by England  £    The author cannot complain that I state the interest paid by England as too low He takes it himself as the extremest term Nobody who knows any thing of the French finances will affirm that I state the interest paid by that kingdom too high It might be easily proved to amount to a great deal more even this is near two millions above what is paid by England  THERE are three standards to judge of the good condition of a nation with regard to its finances st The relief of the people d The equality of supplies to establishments d The state of public credit Try France on all these standards  ALTHOUGH our author very liberally administers relief to the people of France its government has not been altogether so gracious Since the peace  she has taken off but a single  Vingtieme  or shilling in the pound and some small matter in the capitation But if the government has relieved them in one point it has only burthened them the more heavily in another The  Taille    A tax rated by the intendant in each generality on the presumed fortune of every person below the degree of a gentleman  that grievous and destructive imposition which all their financiers lament without being able to remove or to replace has been augmented no less than millions of livres or pounds English A further augmentation of this or other duties is now talked of and it is certainly necessary to their affairs so exceedingly remote from either truth or verisimilitude is the author's amazing assertion  that the burthens of France in the war were in a great measure temporary and must be greatly diminished by a few years of peace    IN the next place if the people of France are not lightened with taxes so neither is the state disburthened of charges I speak from very good information that the annual income of that state is at this day millions of livres or £ sterling short of a provision for their ordinary peace establishment so far are they from the attempt or even hope to discharge any part of the capital of their enormous debt Indeed under such extreme straitness and distraction labours the whole body of their finances so far does their charge outrun their supply in every particular that no man I believe who has considered their affairs with any degree of attention or information but must hourly look for some extraordinary convulsion in that whole system the effect of which on France and even on all Europe it is difficult to conjecture  IN the third point of view their credit Let the reader cast his eye on a table of the price of French funds as they stood a few weeks ago compared with the state of some of our English stocks even in their present low condition  French  British    per cents    Bank stock  ½      per cent  not taxed      per cent  cons      per cent  ditto      per cent  cons    THIS state of the funds of France and England is sufficient to convince even prejudice and obstinacy that if France and England are not in the same condition as the author affirms they are not the difference is infinitely to the disadvantage of France This depreciation of their funds has not much the air of a nation lightening burthens and discharging debts  SUCH is the true comparative state of the two kingdoms in those capital points of view Now as to the nature of the taxes which provide for this debt as well as for their ordinary establishments the author has thought proper to affirm that  "they are comparatively light" that "she has mortgaged no such oppressive taxes as ours"  his effrontery on this head is intolerable Does the author recollect a single tax in England to which something parallel in nature and as heavy in burthen does not exist in France does he not know that the lands of the noblesse are still under the load of the greater part of the old feudal charges from which the gentry of England have been relieved for upwards of years and which were in kind as well as burthen much worse than our modern land tax Besides that all the gentry of France serve in the army on very slender pay and to the utter ruin of their fortunes all those who are  not noble have their lands heavily taxed Does he not know that wine brandy soap candles leather saltpetre gunpowder are taxed in France Has he not heard that government in France has made a monopoly of that great article of  salt  that they compel the people to take a certain quantity of it and at a certain rate both rate and quantity fixed at the arbitrary pleasure of the imposer  Before the war it was sold to or rather forced on the consumer at sous or about d the pound What it is at present I am not informed Even this will appear no trivial imposition In London salt may be had at a penny farthing per pound from the last retailer  that they pay in France the  Taille  an arbitrary imposition on presumed property that a tax is laid in fact and name on the same arbitrary standard upon the acquisitions of their  industry  and that in France a heavy  capitationtax  is also paid from the highest to the very poorest sort of people have we taxes of such weight or any thing at all of the compulsion in the article of  salt  do we pay any  taillage  any  facultytax  any  industrytax  do we pay any  capitationtax  whatsoever I believe the people of London would fall into an agony to hear of such taxes proposed upon them as are paid at Paris There is not a single article of provision for man or beast which enters that great city and is not excised corn hay meal butchers meat fish fowls every thing I do not here mean to censure the policy of taxes laid on the consumption of great luxurious cities I only state the fact We should be with difficulty brought to hear of a tax of s upon every ox sold in Smithfield Yet this tax is paid in Paris Wine the lower sort of wine little better than English small beer pays d a bottle We indeed tax our beer but the imposition on small beer is very far from heavy In no  part of England are eatables of any kind the object of taxation In almost every other country in Europe they are excised more or less I have by me the state of the revenues of many of the principal nations on the continent and on comparing them with ours I think I am fairly warranted to assert that England is the most lightly taxed of any of the great states of Europe They whose unnatural and sullen joy arises from a contemplation of the distresses of their country will revolt at this position But if I am called upon I will prove it beyond all possibility of dispute even though this proof should deprive these gentlemen of the singular satisfaction of considering their country as undone and though the best civil government the best constituted and the best managed revenue that ever the world beheld should be thoroughly vindicated from their perpetual clamours and complaints As to our neighbour and rival France in addition to what I have here suggested I say and when the author chooses formally to deny I shall formally prove it that her subjects pay more than England on a computation of the wealth of both countries that her taxes are more injudiciously and more oppressively imposed more vexatiously collected come in a smaller proportion to the royal coffers and are less applied by far to the public service I am not one of those who choose to take the author's word for this happy and flourishing condition of the French finances rather than attend to the changes the violent pushes and the despair of all her own financiers Does he choose to be referred for the easy and happy condition of the subject in France to the remonstrances of their own parliaments written with such an eloquence feeling and energy as I have not seen exceeded in any other writings The author may say their complaints are exaggerated and the effects of faction  I answer that they are the representations of numerous grave and most respectable bodies of men upon the affairs of their own country But allowing that discontent and faction may pervert the judgment of such venerable bodies in France we have as good a right to suppose that the same causes may full as probably have produced from a private however respectable person that frightful and I trust I have shewn groundless representation of our own affairs in England  THE author is so conscious of the dangerous effects of that representation that he thinks it necessary and very necessary it is to guard against them He assures us  "that he has not made that display of the difficulties of his country to expose her counsels to the ridicule of other states or to provoke a vanquished enemy to insult her nor to excite the peoples rage against their governors or sink them into a despondency of the public welfare"  I readily admit this apology for his intentions God forbid I should think any man capable of entertaining so execrable and senseless a design The true cause of his drawing so shocking a picture is no more than this and it ought rather to claim our pity than excite our indignation he finds himself out of power and this condition is intolerable to him The same sun which gilds all nature and exhilarates the whole creation does not shine upon disappointed ambition It is something that rays out of darkness and inspires nothing but gloom and melancholy Men in this deplorable state of mind find a comfort in spreading the contagion of their spleen They find an advantage too for it is a general popular error to imagine the loudest complainers for the public to be the most anxious for its welfare  If such persons can answer the ends of relief and profit to themselves they are apt to be careless enough about either the means or the consequences  WHATEVER this complainant's motives may be the effects can by no possibility be other than those which he so strongly and I hope truely disclaims all intention of producing To verify this the reader has only to consider how dreadful a picture he has drawn in his d page of the state of this kingdom such a picture as I believe has hardly been applicable without some exaggeration to the most degenerate and undone commonwealth that ever existed Let this view of things be compared with the prospect of a remedy which he proposes in the page directly opposite and the subsequent I believe no man living could have imagined it possible except for the sake of burlesquing a subject to propose remedies so ridiculously disproportionate to the evil so full of uncertainty in their operation and depending for their success in every step upon the happy event of so many new dangerous and visionary projects It is not amiss that he has thought proper to give the public some little notice of what they may expect from his friends when our affairs shall be committed to their management Let us see how the accounts of disease and remedy are balanced in his State of the Nation In the first place on the side of evils he states  "an impoverished and heavilyburthened public A declining trade and decreasing specie The power of the crown never so much extended over the great but the great without influence over the lower sort Parliament losing its reverence with the people The voice of the multitude set up against the sense of the legislature a people luxurious and licentious impatient  of rule and despising all authority Government relaxed in every sinew and a corrupt selfish spirit pervading the whole An opinion of many that the form of government is not worth contending for No attachment in the bulk of the people towards the constitution No reverence for the customs of our ancestors No attachment but to private interest nor any zeal but for selfish gratifications Trade and manufactures going to ruin Great Britain in danger of becoming tributary to France and the descent of the crown dependent on her pleasure Ireland in case of a war to become a prey to France and Great Britain unable to recover Ireland cede it by treaty the author never can think of a treaty without making cessions in order to purchase peace for herself The colonies left exposed to the ravages of a domestic or the conquest of a foreign enemy"  Gloomy enough God knows The author well observes  P  that a mind not totally devoid of feeling cannot look upon such a prospect without horror and an heart capable of humanity must be unable to bear its description  He ought to have added that no man of common discretion ought to have exhibited it to the public if it were true or of common honesty if it were false  BUT now for the comfort the daystar which is to arise in our hearts the author's grand scheme for totally reversing this dismal state of things and making us  P  "happy at home and respected abroad formidable in war and flourishing in peace"  IN this great work he proceeds with a facility equally astonishing and pleasing Never was financier less embarrassed by the burthen of establishments  two last years as given by the author himself and lastly the new project of his political millennium     £  Plan of establishment for as by Considerations p  The figures in the Considerations are wrong cast up it should be £    Medium of and as by State of the Nation p and    Present peace establishment as by the project in State of the Nation p    IT is not from any thing our author has any where said that you are enabled to find the ground much less the justification of the immense difference between these several systems you must compare them yourself article by article no very pleasing employment by the way to compare the agreement or disagreement of two chimeras I now only speak of the comparison of his own two projects As to the latter of them it differs from the former by having some of the articles diminished and others encreased  Confid p St of N p  I find the chief article of reduction arises from the smaller deficiency of land and malt and of the annuity funds which he brings down to £ in his new estimate from £ which he had allowed for those articles in the Considerations With this  reduction  owing as it must be merely to a smaller deficiency of funds he has nothing at all to do It can be no work and no merit of his But with regard to the  encrease  the matter is very different It is all his own the public is loaded for any thing we can see to the contrary entirely  gratis  The chief articles of the  Ibid  encrease  are on the navy and on the army and ordnance extraordinaries the navy being estimated in his  State of the Nation  £ a year more and the army and ordnance extraordinaries £ more than he had thought proper to allow for them in that estimate in his  Considerations  which he makes the foundation of his present project He has given no sort of reason stated no sort of necessity for this additional allowance either in the one article or the other What is still stronger he admits that his allowance for the army and ordnance extras is too great and expressly refers you to the  Considerations    P  where far from giving £ a year to that service as the  State of the Nation  has done the author apprehends his own scanty provision of £ to be by far too considerable and thinks it may well admit of further reductions  The author of the State of the Nation p informs us that the sum of £ allowed by him for the extras of the army and ordnance is far less than was allowed for the same service in the years and It is so undoubtedly and by at least £ He sees that he cannot abide by the plan of the Considerations in this point nor is he willing wholly to give it up Such an enormous difference as that between £ and £ puts him to a stand Should he adopt the latter plan of encreased expence he must then confess that he had on a former occasion egregiously trifled with the public at the same time all his future promises of reduction must fall to the ground If he stuck to the £ he was sure that every one must expect from him some account how this monstrous charge came to continue ever since the war when it was clearly unnecessary how all those successions of ministers his own included came to pay it and why his great friend in parliament and his partizans without doors came not to pursue to ruin at least to utter shame the authors of so groundless and scandalous a profusion In this strait he took a middle way and to come nearer the real state of the service he outbid the Considerations at one stroke £ at same time he hints to you that you may  expect  some benefit also from the original plan But the author of the Considerations will not suffer him to escape so He has pinned him down to his £ for that is the sum he has chosen not as what he thinks will probably be required but as making the most ample allowance for every possible contingency See that author p and  Thus according to his own principles  this great oeconomist falls into a vicious prodigality and is as far in his estimate from a consistency with his own principles as with the real nature of the services  STILL however his present establishment differs from its archetype of by being though raised in particular parts upon the whole about £ smaller It is improved he tells us by the experience of the two last years One would have concluded that the peace establishment of these two years had been less than that of in order to suggest to the author his improvements which enabled him to reduce it But how does that turn out        £  Peace establishment and  He has done great injustice to the establishment of but I have not here time for this discussion nor is it necessary to this argument  medium       Ditto estimate in the Considerations for       Difference  £    A vast encrease instead of diminution The experience then of the two last years ought naturally to have given the idea of an heavier establishment but this writer is able to diminish by encreasing and to draw the effects of subtraction from the operations of addition By means of  these new powers he may certainly do whatever he pleases He is indeed moderate enough in the use of them and condescends to settle his establishments at £ a year  HOWEVER he has not yet done with it he has further ideas of saving and new resources of revenue These additional savings are principally two st  It is to be hoped  says he  P  that the sum of £ which in the estimate he allows for the deficiency of land and malt will be less by £  In making up this account he falls into a surprizing error of arithmetic  P  "The deficiency of the landtax in the year and when it was at s amounted to no more on a medium than £ to which if we add  half the sum  it will give us £ as the peace deficiency at s"        £  Total       Add the half       Result  £    Which he makes £ This is indeed in disfavour of his argument but we shall see that he has ways by other errors of reimbursing himself  d THAT the sum of £ allowed for the Foundling Hospital and £ for American Surveys will soon cease to be necessary as the services will be compleated  WHAT follows with regard to the resources is very well worthy of the reader's attention  "Of this estimate says he  P  upwards of £ will be for the plantation service and that sum  I hope  the people of Ireland and the colonies  might be induced  to take off Great Britain and  defray between them in the proportion of £ by the colonies and £ by Ireland"  SUCH is the whole of this mighty scheme Take his reduced estimate and his further reductions and his resources all together and the result will be He will  certainly  lower the provision made for the navy He will cut off largely God knows what or how from the army and ordnance extraordinaries He may be  expected  to cut off more He  hopes  that the deficiencies on land and malt will be less than usual and he  hopes  that America and Ireland might be  induced  to take off £ of our annual charges  IF any one of these Hopes Mights Insinuations Expectations and Inducements should fail him there will be a formidable gaping breach in his whole project If all of them should fail he has left the nation without a glimmering of hope in this thick night of terrors which he has thought fit to spread about us If every one of them which attended with success would signify any thing to our revenue can have no effect but to add to our distractions and dangers we shall be if possible in a still worse condition from his projects of cure than he represents us from our original disorders  BEFORE we examine into the consequence of these schemes and the probability of these savings let us suppose them all real and all safe and then see what it is they amount to and how he reasons on them        £  Deficiency on land and malt less by       Foundling Hospital       American Surveys          £    This is the amount of the only articles of saving he specifies and yet he chooses to assert  P  "that we may venture on the credit of them to reduce the standing expences of the estimate from £ to £ "  that is for a saving of £ he is not ashamed to take credit for a defalcation from his own ideal establishment in a sum of no less than £ Suppose even that we were to take up the estimate of the Considerations which is however abandoned in the State of the Nation and reduce his £ extraordinaries to the original £ still all these savings joined together give us but £ that is near £ short of the credit he calls for and for which he has neither given any reason nor furnished any data whatsoever for others to reason upon  SUCH are his savings as operating on his own project of a peace establishment Let us now consider them as they affect the existing establishment and our actual services He tells us the sum allowed in his estimate for the navy is  "£ less than the grant for that service in but in that grant £ was included for the purchase of hemp and a saving of about £ was made in that year"  The author has got some secret in arithmetic These two sums put together amount in the ordinary way of computing to £ and not to £ On  what principle has he chosen to take credit for £ more To what this strange inaccuracy is owing I cannot possibly comprehend nor is it very material where the logic is so bad and the policy so erroneous whether the arithmetic be just or otherwise But in a scheme for making this nation  "happy at home and respected abroad formidable in war and flourishing in peace"  it is surely a little unfortunate for us that he has picked out the  Navy  as the very first object of his oeconomical experiments Of all the public services that of the navy is the one in which tampering may be of the greatest danger which can worst be supplied upon an emergency and of which any failure draws after it the longest and heaviest train of consequences I am far from saying that this or any service ought not to be conducted with oeconomy But I will never suffer the sacred name of oeconomy to be bestowed upon arbitrary defalcation of charge The author tells us himself  "that to suffer the navy to rot in harbour for want of repairs and marines would be to invite destruction"  It would be so When the author talks therefore of savings on the navy estimate it is incumbent on him to let us know not what sums he will cut off but what branch of that service he deems superfluous Instead of putting us off with unmeaning generalities he ought to have stated what naval force what naval works and what naval stores with the lowest estimated expence are necessary to keep our marine in a condition commensurate to its great ends And this too not for the contracted and deceitful space of a single year but for some reasonable term Every body knows that many charges cannot be in their nature regular or annual In the year a stock of hemp c was to be laid in that charge intermits but it does not end Other charges of  other kinds take their place Great works are now carrying on at Portsmouth but not of greater magnitude than utility and they must be provided for A year's estimate is therefore no just idea at all of a permanent peace establishment Had the author opened this matter upon these plain principles a judgment might have been formed how far he had contrived to reconcile national defence with public oeconomy Till he has done it those who had rather depend on any man's reason than the greatest man's authority will not give him credit on this head for the saving of a single shilling As to those savings which are already made or in course of being made whether right or wrong he has nothing at all to do with them they can be no part of his project considered as a plan of reformation I greatly fear that the error has not lately been on the side of profusion  ANOTHER head is the saving on the Army and Ordnance extraordinaries particularly in the American branch What or how much reduction may be made none of us I believe can with any fairness pretend to say very little I am convinced The state of America is extremely unsettled more troops have been sent thither new dispositions have been made and this augmentation of number and change of disposition has rarely I believe the effect of lessening the bill for extraordinaries which if not this year yet in the next we must certainly feel Care has not been wanting to introduce oeconomy into that part of the service The author's great friend has made I admit some regulations his immediate successors have made more and better This part will be handled more ably and more minutely at another time but no one can cut down this bill of extraordinaries at his pleasure The author has given  us nothing but his word for any certain or considerable reduction and this we ought to be the more cautious in taking as he has promised great savings in his  Considerations  which he has not chosen to abide by in his  State of the Nation    ON this head also of the American extraordinaries he can take credit for nothing As to his next the lessening of the deficiency of the land and malt tax particularly of the malt tax any person the least conversant in that subject cannot avoid a smile This deficiency arises from charge of collection from anticipation and from defective produce What has the author said on the reduction of any head of this deficiency upon the land tax On these points he is absolutely silent As to the deficiency on the malt tax which is chiefly owing to a defective produce he has and can have nothing to propose If this deficiency should be lessened by the encrease of malting in any years more than others as it is a greatly fluctuating object how much of this obligation shall we owe to this author's ministry will it not be the case under any administration must it not go to the general service of the year in some way or other let the finances be in whose hands they will But why take credit for so extremely reduced a deficiency at all I can tell him he has no rational ground for it in the produce of the year and I suspect will have full as little reason from the produce of the year That produce may indeed become greater and the deficiency of course will be less It may too be far otherwise A fair and judicious financier will not as this writer has done for the sake of making out a specious account select a favourable year or two at remote periods and ground his calculations on those In he will not take the deficiencies of  and for his standard Sober men have hitherto and must continue this course to preserve this character taken indifferently the mediums of the years immediately preceding But a person who has a scheme from which he promises much to the public ought to be still more cautious he should ground his speculation rather on the lowest mediums because all new schemes are known to be subject to some defect or failure not foreseen and which therefore every prudent proposer will be ready to allow for in order to lay his foundation as low and as solid as possible Quite contrary is the practice of some politicians They first propose savings which they well know cannot be made in order to get a reputation for oeconomy In due time they assume another but a different method by providing for the service they had before cut off or straitened and which they can then very easily prove to be necessary In the same spirit they raise magnificent ideas of revenue on funds which they know to be insufficient Afterwards who can blame them if they do not satisfy the public desires They are great artificers but they cannot work without materials  THESE are some of the little arts of great statesmen To such we leave them and follow where the author leads us to his next resource the Foundlinghospital Whatever particular virtue there is in the mode of this saving there seems to be nothing at all new and indeed nothing wonderfully important in it The sum annually voted for the support of the Foundlinghospital has been in a former parliament limited to the establishment of the children then in the hospital When they are apprenticed this provision will cease It will therefore fall in more or less at different times and will at length cease entirely But until it  does we cannot reckon upon it as the saving on the establishment of any given year nor can any one conceive how the author comes to mention this any more than some other articles as a part of a  new  plan of oeconomy which is to retrieve our affairs This charge will indeed cease in its own time But will no other succeed to it Has he ever known the public free from some contingent charge either for the just support of royal dignity or for national magnificence or for public charity or for public service does he choose to flatter his readers that no such will ever return or does he in good earnest declare that let the reason or necessity be what they will he is resolved not to provide for such services  ANOTHER resource of oeconomy yet remains for he gleans the field very closely £ for the American surveys Why what signifies a dispute about trifles he shall have it But while he is carrying it off I shall just whisper in his ear that neither the saving that is allowed nor that which is doubted of can at all belong to that future proposed administration whose touch is to cure all our evils Both the one and the other belong equally as indeed all the rest do to the present administration to any administration because they are the gift of time and not the bounty of the exchequer  I HAVE now done with all the minor preparatory parts of the author's scheme the several articles of saving which he proposes At length comes the capital operation his new resources Three hundred thousand pounds a year from America and IrelandAlas alas if that too should fail us what will become of this poor undone nation The author in a tone of great humility  hopes  they may be induced to pay it Well if that be  all we may hope so too and for any light he is pleased to give us into the ground of this hope and the ways and means of this inducement here is a speedy end both of the question and the revenue  IT is the constant custom of this author in all his writings to take it for granted that he has given you a revenue whenever he can point out to you where you may have money if you can contrive how to get at it and this seems to be the masterpiece of his financial ability I think however in his way of proceeding he has behaved rather like an harsh stepdame than a kind nursing mother to his country Why stop at £ If his state of things be at all founded America and Ireland are much better able to pay £ than we are to satisfy ourselves with half that sum However let us forgive him this one instance of tenderness towards Ireland and the colonies  HE spends a vast deal of time  P  in an endeavour to prove that Ireland is able to bear greater impositions He is of opinion that the poverty of the lower class of people there is in a great measure owing to  a want  of judicious taxes that a land tax will enrich her tenants that taxes are paid in England which are not paid there that the colony trade is encreased above £ since the peace that she  ought  to have further indulgences in that trade and  ought  to have further privileges in the woollen manufacture From these premises of what she has what she has not and what she ought to have he infers that Ireland will contribute £ towards the extraordinaries of the American establishment  I SHALL make no objections whatsoever logical or financial to this reasoning many occur but  they would lead me from my purpose from which I do not intend to be diverted because it seems to me of no small importance It will be just enough to hint what I dare say many readers have before observed that when any man proposes new taxes in a country with which he is not personally conversant by residence or office he ought to lay open its situation much more minutely and critically than this author has done or than perhaps he is able to do He ought not to content himself with saying that a single article of her trade is encreased £ a year he ought if he argues from the encrease of trade to the encrease of taxes to state the whole trade and not one branch of trade only he ought to enter fully into the state of its remittances and the course of its exchange he ought likewise to examine whether all its establishments are encreased or diminished and whether it incurs or discharges debt annually But I pass over all this and am content to ask a few plain questions  DOES the author then seriously mean to propose in parliament a land tax or any tax for £ a year upon Ireland if he does and if fatally by his temerity and our weakness he should succeed then I say he will throw the whole empire from one end of it to the other into mortal convulsions What is it that can satisfy the furious and perturbed mind of this man is it not enough for him that such projects have alienated our colonies from the mother country and not to propose violently to tear our sister kingdom also from our side and to convince every dependent part of the empire that when a little money is to be raised we have no sort of regard to their ancient customs their opinions their circumstances or their affections He has however a  douceur  for Ireland in his pocket benefits  in trade by opening the woollen manufacture to that nation A very right idea in my opinion but not more strong in reason than likely to be opposed by the most powerful and most violent of all local prejudices and popular passions First a fire is already kindled by his schemes of taxation in America he then proposes one which will set all Ireland in a blaze and his way of quenching both is by a plan which may kindle perhaps ten times a greater flame in Britain  WILL the author pledge himself previously to his proposal of such a tax to carry this enlargement of the Irish trade if he does not then the tax will be certain the benefit will be less than problematical In this view his compensation to Ireland vanishes into smoke the tax to their prejudices will appear stark naked in the light of an act of arbitrary power and oppression But if he should propose the benefit and tax together then the people of Ireland a very high and spirited people would think it the worst bargain in the world They would look upon the one as wholly vitiated and poisoned by the other and if they could not be separated would infallibly resist them both together Here would be taxes indeed amounting to an handsome sum £ very effectually voted and passed through the best and most authentic forms but how to be collectedThis is his perpetual manner One of his projects depends for success upon another project and this upon a third all of them equally visionary His finance is like the Indian philosophy his Earth is poised on the horns of a Bull his Bull stands on an Elephant his Elephant is supported by a Tortoise and so on for ever  As to his American £ a year he is satisfied to repeat gravely as he has done an hundred  times before that the Americans are able to pay it Well and what then does he lay open any part of his plan how they may be compelled to pay it without plunging ourselves into calamities that outweigh tenfold the proposed benefit or does he shew how they may be induced to submit to it quietly or does he give any satisfaction concerning the mode of levying it in commercial colonies one of the most important and difficult of all considerations Nothing like it To the stamp act whatever its excellencies may be I think he will not in reality recur or even choose to assert that he means to do so in case his minister should come again into power If he does I will predict that some of the fastest friends of that minister will desert him upon this point As to port duties he has damned them all in the lump by declaring them  P  "contrary to the first principles of colonization and not less prejudicial to the interests of Great Britain than to those of the colonies"  Surely this single observation of his ought to have taught him a little caution he ought to have begun to doubt whether there is not something in the nature of commercial colonies which renders them an unfit object of taxation when port duties so large a fund of revenue in almost all countries are by himself found in this case not only improper but destructive However he has here pretty well narrowed the field of taxation Stamp act hardly to be resumed Port duties mischievous Excises I believe he will scarcely think worth the collection if any revenue should be so in America Land tax notwithstanding his opinion of its immense use to agriculture he will not directly propose before he has thought again and again on the subject Indeed he very readily recommends it for Ireland and seems to think it  not improper for America because he observes they already raise most of their taxes internally including this tax A most curious reason truly because their lands are already heavily burthened he thinks it right to burthen them still further But he will recollect for surely he cannot be ignorant of it that the lands of America are not as in England let at a rent certain in money and therefore cannot as here be taxed at a certain pound rate They value them in gross among themselves and none but themselves in their several districts can value them Without their hearty concurrence and cooperation it is evident we cannot advance a step in the assessing or collecting any land tax As to the taxes which in some places the Americans pay by the acre they are merely duties of regulation they are small and to encrease them notwithstanding the secret virtues of a land tax would be the most effectual means of preventing that cultivation they are intended to promote Besides the whole country is heavily in arrear already for land taxes and quit rents They have different methods of taxation in the different provinces agreeable to their several local circumstances In New England by far the greatest part of their revenue is raised by  faculty taxes  and  capitations  Such is the method in many others It is obvious that parliament unassisted by the colonies themselves cannot take so much as a single step in this mode of taxation Then what tax is it he will impose Why after all the boasting speeches and writings of his faction for these four years after all the vain expectations which they have held out to a deluded public this their great advocate after twisting the subject every way after writhing himself in every posture after knocking at every door is obliged fairly to abandon every mode of taxation whatsoever in America  He thinks  P  it the best method for parliament to impose the sum and reserve the account to itself leaving the mode of taxation to the colonies But how and in what proportion what does the author say O not a single syllable on this the most material part of the whole question Will he in parliament undertake to settle the proportions of such payments from Nova Scotia to Nevis in no fewer than six and twenty different countries varying in almost every possible circumstance one from another if he does I tell him he adjourns his revenue to a very long day If he leaves it to themselves to settle these proportions he adjourns it to doomsday  THEN what does he get by this method on the side of acquiescence will the people of America relish this course of giving and granting and applying their money the better because their assemblies are made commissioners of the taxes This is far worse than all his former projects for here if the assemblies shall refuse or delay or be negligent or fraudulent in this newimposed duty we are wholly without remedy and neither our customhouse officers nor our troops nor our armed ships can be of the least use in the collection No idea can be more contemptible I will not call it an oppressive one the harshness is lost in the folly than that of proposing to get any revenue from the Americans but by their freest and most chearful consent Most monied men know their own interest right well and are as able as any financier in the valuation of risks Yet I think this financier will scarcely find that adventurer hardy enough at any premium to advance a shilling upon a vote of such taxes Let him name the man or set of men that would do it This  is the only proof of the value of revenues what would an interested man rate them at His subscription would be at ninetynine  per cent  discount the very first day of its opening Here is our only national security from ruin a security upon which no man in his senses would venture a shilling of his fortune Yet he puts down those articles as gravely in his supply for his peace establishment as if the money had been all fairly lodged in the exchequer     £  American revenue    Ireland    Very handsome indeed but if supply is to be got in such a manner farewell the lucrative mystery of finance If you are to be credited for savings without shewing how why or with what safety they are to be made and for revenues without specifying on what articles or by what means or at what expence they are to be collected there is not a clerk in a public office who may not outbid this author or his friend for the department of chancellor of the exchequer not an apprentice in the city that will not strike out with the same advantages the same or a much larger plan of supply  HERE is the whole of what belongs to the author's scheme for saving us from impending destruction Take it even in its most favourable point of view as a thing within possibility and imagine what must be the wisdom of this gentleman or his opinion of ours who could first think of representing this nation in such a state as no friend can look upon but with horror and scarce an enemy without compassion and afterwards of diverting himself with such inadequate impracticable  puerile methods for our relief If these had been the dreams of some unknown unnamed and nameless writer they would excite no alarm their weakness had been an antidote to their malignity But as they are universally believed to be written by the hand or what amounts to the same thing under the immediate direction of a person who has been in the management of the highest affairs and may soon be in the same situation I think it is not to be reckoned amongst our greatest consolations that the yet remaining power of this kingdom is to be employed in an attempt to realize notions that are at once so frivolous and so full of danger That consideration will justify me in dwelling a little longer on the difficulties of the nation and the solutions of our author  I AM then persuaded that he cannot be in the least alarmed about our situation let his outcry be what he pleases I will give him a reason for my opinion which I think he cannot dispute All that he bestows upon the nation which it does not possess without him and supposing it all sure money amounts to no more than a sum of £ a year This he thinks will do the business compleatly and render us flourishing at home and respectable abroad If the option between glory and shame if our salvation or destruction depended on this sum it is impossible that he should have been active and made a merit of that activity in taking off a shilling in the pound of the land tax which came up to his grand desideratum and upwards of £ more By this manoeuvre he left our trade navigation and manufactures on the verge of destruction our finances in ruin our credit expiring Ireland on the point of being ceded to France the colonies of being torn to pieces the succession of the crown at the mercy of  our great rival and the kingdom itself on the very point of becoming tributary to that haughty power All this for want of £ for I defy the reader to point out any other revenue or any other precise and defined scheme of politics which he assigns for our redemption  I KNOW that two things may be said in his defence as bad reasons are always at hand in an indifferent cause that he was not sure the money would be applied as he thinks it ought to be by the present ministers I think as ill of them as he does to the full They have done very near as much mischief as they can do to a constitution so robust as this is Nothing can make them more dangerous but that as they are already in general composed of his disciples and instruments they may add to the public calamity of their own measures the adoption of his projects But be the ministers what they may the author knows that they could not avoid applying this £ to the service of the establishment as faithfully as he or any other minister could do I say they could not avoid it and have no merit at all for the application But supposing that they should greatly mismanage this revenue Here is a good deal of room for mistake and prodigality before you come to the edge of ruin The difference between the amount of that real and his imaginary revenue is £ a year at least a tolerable sum for them to play with this might compensate the difference between the author's oeconomy and their profusion and still notwithstanding their vices and ignorance the nation might be saved The author ought also to recollect that a good man would hardly deny even to the worst of ministers the means of doing their duty especially in a crisis when our being depended on supplying them with  some means or other In such a case their penury of mind in discovering resources would make it rather the more necessary not to strip such poor providers of the little stock they had in hand  BESIDES here is another subject of distress and a very serious one which puts us again to a stand The author may possibly not come into power I only state the possibility he may not always continue in it and if the contrary to all this should fortunately for us happen what insurance on his life can be made for a sum adequate to his loss Then we are thus unluckily situated that the  chance  of an American and Irish revenue of £ to be managed by him is to save us from ruin two or three years hence at best to make us happy at home and glorious abroad and the actual possession of £ English taxes cannot so much as protract our ruin without him So we are staked on four chances his power its permanence the success of his projects and the duration of his life Any one of these failing we are gone  Propria haec si dona fuissent  This is no unfair representation ultimately all hangs on his life because in his account of every set of men that have held or supported administration he finds neither virtue nor ability in any but himself Indeed he pays through their measures some compliments to Lord Bute and Lord Despenser But to the latter this is I suppose but a civility to old acquaintance to the former a little stroke of politics We may therefore fairly say that our only hope is his life and he has to make it the more so taken care to cut off any resource which we possessed independent of him  IN the next place it may be said to excuse any appearance of inconsistency between the author's actions and his declarations that he thought it  right to relieve the landed interest and lay the burthen where it ought to lie on the colonies What to take off a revenue so necessary to our being before any thing whatsoever was acquired in the place of it In prudence he ought to have waited at least for the first quarter's receipt of the new anonymous American revenue and Irish land tax Is there something so specific for our disorders in American and something so poisonous in English money that one is to heal the other to destroy us To say that the landed interest  could  not continue to pay it for a year or two longer is more than the author will attempt to prove To say that they  would  pay it no longer is to treat the landed interest in my opinion very scurvily To suppose that the gentry clergy and freeholders of England do not rate the commerce the credit the religion the liberty the independency of their country and the succession of their crown at a shilling in the pound land tax They never gave him reason to think so meanly of them And if I am rightly informed when that measure was debated in parliament a very different reason was assigned by the author's great friend as well as by others for that reduction one very different from the critical and almost desperate state of our finances Some people then endeavoured to prove that the reduction might be made without detriment to the national credit or the due support of a proper peace establishment otherwise it is obvious that the reduction could not be defended in argument So that this author cannot despair so much of the commonwealth without this American and Irish revenue as he pretends to do If he does the reader sees how handsomely he has provided for us by voting away one revenue and by giving us a pamphlet on the other  I DO not mean to blame the relief which was then given by parliament to the land It was grounded on very weighty reasons The administration contended only for its continuance for a year in order to have the merit of taking off the shilling in the pound immediately before the elections and thus to bribe the freeholders of England with their own money  IT is true the author in his estimate of ways and means takes credit for £ a year  Indian revenue  But he will not very positively insist that we should put this revenue to the account of his plans or his power and for a very plain reason we are already near two years in possession of it By what means we came to that possession is a pretty long story however I shall give nothing more than a short abstract of the proceeding in order to see whether the author will take to himself any part in that measure  THE fact is this the East India company had for a good while solicited the ministry for a negotiation by which they proposed to pay largely for some advantages in their trade and for the renewal of their charter This had been the former method of transacting with that body Government having only leased the monopoly for short terms the company has been obliged to resort to it frequently for renewals These two parties had always negotiated on the true principle of credit not as government and subject but as equal dealers on the footing of mutual advantage The public had derived great benefit from such dealing But at that time new ideas prevailed The ministry instead of listening to the proposals of that company chose to set up a claim of the crown to their possessions The original plan seems to have been to get the house of commons to compliment the  crown with a sort of juridical declaration of a title to the company's acquisitions in India which the crown on its part with the best air in the world was to bestow upon the public Then it would come to the turn of the house of commons again to be liberal and grateful to the crown The civil list debts were to be paid off with perhaps a pretty augmentation of income All this was to be done on the most publicspirited principles and with a politeness and mutual interchange of good offices that could not but have charmed But what was best of all these civilities were to be without a farthing of charge to either of the kind and obliging partiesThe East India company was to be covered with infamy and disgrace and at the same time was to pay the whole bill  IN consequence of this scheme the terrors of a parliamentary inquiry were hung over them A judicature was asserted in parliament to try this question But lest this judicial character should chance to inspire certain stubborn ideas of law and right it was argued that the judicature was arbitrary and ought not to determine by the rules of law but by their opinion of policy and expediency Nothing exceeded the violence of some of the managers except their impotence They were bewildered by their passions and by their want of knowledge or want of consideration of the subject The more they advanced the further they found themselves from their objectAll things ran into confusion The ministers quarrelled among themselves They disclaimed one another They suspended violence and shrunk from treaty The inquiry was almost at its last gasp when some active persons of the company were given to understand that this hostile proceeding was only set up  in terrorem  that government was far from an intention of seizing upon the possessions of the company  Administration they said was sensible that the idea was in every light full of absurdity and that such a seizure was not more out of their power than remote from their wishes and therefore if the company would come in a liberal manner to the house they certainly could not fail of putting a speedy end to this disagreeable business and of opening the way to an advantageous treaty  ON this hint the company acted they came at once to a resolution of getting rid of the difficulties which arose from the complication of their trade with their revenue a step which despoiled them of their best defensive armour and put them at once into the power of administration They threw their whole stock of every kind the revenue the trade and even their debt from government into one fund which they computed on the surest grounds would amount to £ with a large probable surplus for the payment of debt Then they agreed to divide this sum in equal portions between themselves and the public £ to each This gave to the proprietors of that fund an annual augmentation of no more than £ dividend They ought to receive from government £ for the loan of their capital So that in fact the whole which on this plan they reserved to themselves from their vast revenues from their extensive trade and in consideration of the great risks and mighty expences which purchased these advantages amounted to no more than £ whilst government was to receive as I said £  THIS proposal was thought by themselves liberal indeed and they expected the highest applauses for it However their reception was very different from their expectations When they brought up their plan to the house of commons the offer as it  was natural of £ was very well relished But nothing could be more disgustful than the £ which the company had divided amongst themselves A violent tempest of public indignation and fury rose against them The heads of people turned The company was held well able to pay £ a year to government but bankrupts if they attempted to divide the fifth part of it among themselves An  ex post facto  law was brought in with great precipitation for annulling this dividend In the bill was inserted a clause which suspended for about a year the right which under the public faith the company enjoyed of making their own dividends Such was the disposition and temper of the house that although the plain face of facts reason arithmetic all the authority parts and eloquence in the kingdom were against this bill though all the chancellors of the exchequer who had held that office from the beginning of this reign opposed it yet a few placemen of the subordinate departments sprung out of their ranks took the lead and by an opinion  of some sort of secret support  carried the bill with an high hand leaving the then secretary of state and the chancellor of the exchequer in a very moderate minority In this distracted situation the managers of the bill notwithstanding their triumph did not venture to propose the payment of the civil list debt The chancellor of the exchequer was not in good humour enough after his late defeat by his own troops to cooperate in such a design so they made an act to lock up the money in the exchequer until they should have time to look about them and settle among themselves what they were to do with it  THUS ended this unparalleled transaction The author I believe will not claim any part of the glory of it he will leave it whole and entire to the  authors of the measure The money was the vo+luntary free gift of the company the rescinding bill was the act of legislature to which they and we owe submission the author has nothing to do with the one or with the other However he cannot avoid rubbing himself against this subject merely for the pleasure of stirring controversies and gratifying a certain pruriency of taxation that seems to infect his blood It is merely to indulge himself in speculations of taxing that he chooses to harangue on this subject For he takes credit for no greater sum than the public is already in possession of He does not hint that the company means or has ever shewn any disposition if managed with common prudence to pay less in future and he cannot doubt that the present ministry are as well inclined to drive them by their mock enquiries and real rescinding bills as he can possibly be with his taxes Besides it is obvious that as great a sum might have been drawn from that company without affecting property or shaking the constitution or endangering the principle of public credit or running into his golden dreams of cockets on the Ganges or visions of stamp duties on  Pervanna's Dustics Kistbundees  and  Husbulhookums  For once I will disappoint him in this part of the dispute and only in a few words recommend to his consideration how he is to get off the dangerous idea of taxing a public fund if he levies those duties in England and if he is to levy them in India what provision he has made for a revenue establishment there supposing that he undertakes this new scheme of finance independently of the company and against its inclinations  SO much for these revenues which are nothing but his visions or already the national possessions without any act of his It is easy to parade with an  high talk of parliamentary rights of the universality of legislative powers and of uniform taxation Men of sense when new projects come before them always think a discourse proving the mere right or mere power of acting in the manner proposed to be no more than a very unpleasant way of mispending time They must see the object to be of proper magnitude to engage them they must see the means of compassing it to be next to certain the mischiefs not to counterbalance the profit they will examine how a proposed imposition or regulation agrees with the opinion of those who are likely to be affected by it they will not despise the consideration even of their habitudes and prejudices They wish to know how it accords or disagrees with the true spirit of prior establishments whether of government or of finance because they well know that in the complicated oeconomy of great kingdoms and immense revenues which in a length of time and by a variety of accidents have coalesced into a sort of body an attempt towards a compulsory equality in all circumstances and an exact practical definition of the supreme rights in every case is the most dangerous and chimerical of all enterprizes The old building stands well enough though part Gothic part Grecian and part Chinese until an attempt is made to square it into uniformity Then it may come down upon our heads all together in much uniformity of ruin and great will be the fall thereof Some people instead of inclining to debate the matter only feel a sort of nausea when they are told that  "protection calls for supply" and that "all the parts ought to contribute to the support of the whole"  Strange argument for great and grave deliberation As if the same end may not and must not be compassed according to its circumstances by a great diversity of ways Thus in Great Britain some of our establishments are apt  for the support of credit They stand therefore upon a principle of their own distinct from and in some respects contrary to the relation between prince and subject It is a new species of contract superinduced upon the old contract of the state The idea of power must as much as possible be banished from it for power and credit are things adverse incompatible  Non bene conveniunt nec in una sede morantur  Such establishments are our great  monied  companies To tax them would be critical and dangerous and contradictory to the very purpose of their institution which is credit and cannot therefore be taxation But the nation when it gave up that power did not give up the advantage but supposed and with reason that government was overpaid in credit for what it seemed to lose in authority In such a case to talk of the rights of sovereignty is quite idle Other establishments supply other modes of public contribution Our  trading  companies as well as individual importers are a fit subject of revenue by customs Some establishments pay us by a  monopoly  of their consumption and their produce This nominally no tax in reality comprehends all taxes Such establishments are our colonies To tax them would be as erroneous in policy as rigorous in equity Ireland supplies us by furnishing troops in war and by bearing part of our foreign establishment in peace She aids us at all times by the money that her absentees spend amongst us which is no small part of the rental of that kingdom Thus Ireland contributes her part Some objects bear port duties Some are fitter for an inland excise The mode varies the object is the same To strain these from their old and inveterate leanings might impair the old benefit and not answer the end of the new project Among all the great men of antiquity  Procrustes  shall never be my hero of legislation  with his iron bed the allegory of his government and the type of some modern policy by which the long limb was to be cut short and the short tortured into length Such was the statebed of uniformity He would I conceive be a very indifferent farmer who complained that his sheep did not plough or his horses yield him wool tho' it would be an idea full of equality They may think this right in rustic oeconomy who think it available in the politic  Qui Bavium non odit amet tua carmina Maevi  Atque idem jungat vulpes et mulgeat hircos  As the author has stated this Indian taxation for no visible purpose relative to his plan of supply so he has stated many other projects with as little if any distinct end unless perhaps to shew you how full he is of projects for the public good and what vast expectations may be formed of him or his friends if they should be translated into administration It is always from some opinion that these speculations may one day become our public measures that I think it worth while to trouble the reader at all about them  Two of them stand out in high relievo beyond the rest The first is a change in the internal representation of this country by enlarging our number of constituents The second is an addition to our representatives by new American members of parliament I pass over here all considerations how far such a system will be an improvement of our constitution according to any sound theory Not that I mean to condemn such speculative enquiries concerning this great object of the national attention They may tend to clear doubtful points and possibly may lead as they have often done to real improvements What I object to is their  introduction into a discourse relating to the immediate state of our affairs and recommending plans of practical government In this view I see nothing in them but what is usual with the author an attempt to raise discontent in the people of England to balance those discontents the measures of his friends had already raised in America What other reason can he have for suggesting that we are not happy enough to enjoy a sufficient number of voters in England I believe that most sober thinkers on this subject are rather of opinion that our fault is on the other side and that it would be more in the spirit of our constitution and more agreeable to the pattern of our best laws by lessening the number to add to the weight and independency of our voters And truly considering the immense and dangerous charge of elections the prostitute and daring venality the corruption of manners the idleness and profligacy of the lower sort of voters no prudent man would propose to increase such an evil if it be as I fear it is out of our power to administer to it any remedy The author proposes nothing further If he has any improvements that may balance or may lessen this inconvenience he has thought proper to keep them as usual in his own breast Since he has been so reserved I should have wished he had been as cautious with regard to the project itself First because he observes justly that his scheme however it might improve the platform can add nothing to the authority of the legislature much I fear it will have a contrary operation for authority depending on opinion at least as much as on duty an idea circulated among the people that our constitution is not so perfect as it ought to be before you are sure of mending it is a certain method of lessening it in the public opinion Of this irreverent opinion of parliament the author himself complains  in one part of his book and he endeavours to increase it in the other  HAS he well considered what an immense operation any change in our constitution is how many discussions parties and passions it will necessarily excite and when you open it to enquiry in one part where the enquiry will stop Experience shews us that no time can be fit for such changes but a time of general confusion when good men finding every thing already broke up think it right to take advantage of the opportunity of such derangement in favour of an useful alteration Perhaps a time of the greatest security and tranquillity both at home and abroad may likewise be fit but will the author affirm this to be just such a time Transferring an idea of military to civil prudence he ought to know how dangerous it is to make an alteration of your disposition in the face of an enemy  NOW comes his American representation Here too as usual he takes no notice of any difficulty nor says any thing to obviate those objections that must naturally arise in the minds of his readers He throws you his politics as he does his revenue do you make something of them if you can Is not the reader a little astonished at the proposal of an American representation from that quarter It is proposed  P  merely as a project of speculative improvement not from the necessity in the case not to add any thing to the authority of parliament but that we may afford a greater attention to the concerns of the Americans and give them a better opportunity of stating their grievances and of obtaining redress I am glad to find the author has at length discovered that we have not given a sufficient attention to their concerns or a proper redress to their grievances His great friend would once  have been exceedingly displeased with any person who should tell him that he did not attend sufficiently to those concerns He thought he did so when he regulated the colonies over and over again he thought he did so when he formed two general systems of revenue one of portduties and the other of internal taxation These systems supposed or ought to suppose the greatest attention to and the most detailed information of all their affairs However by contending for the American representation he seems at last driven virtually to admit that great caution ought to be used in the exercise of  all  our legislative rights over an object so remote from our eye and so little connected with our immediate feelings that in prudence we ought not to be quite so ready with our taxes until we can secure the desired representation in parliament Perhaps it may be some time before this hopeful scheme can be brought to perfect maturity although the author seems to be no wise aware of any obstructions that lie in the way of it He talks of his union just as he does of his taxes and his savings with as much  sang froid  and ease as if his wish and the enjoyment were exactly the same thing He appears not to have troubled his head with the infinite difficulty of settling that representation on a fair balance of wealth and numbers throughout the several provinces of America and the West Indies under such an infinite variety of circumstances It costs him nothing to fight with nature and to conquer the order of Providence which manifestly opposes itself to the possibility of such a parliamentary union  BUT let us to indulge his passion for projects and power suppose the happy time arrived when the author comes into the ministry and is to realise his speculations The writs are issued for electing  members for America and the WestIndies Some provinces receive them in six weeks some in ten some in twenty A vessel may be lost and then some provinces may not receive them at all But let it be that they all receive them at once and in the shortest time A proper space must be given for proclamation and for the election some weeks at least But the members are chosen and if ships are ready to sail in about six more they arrive in London In the mean time the parliament has sat and business far advanced without American representatives Nay by this time it may happen that the parliament is dissolved and then the members ship themselves again to be again elected The writs may arrive in America before the poor members of a parliament in which they never sat can arrive at their several provinces A new interest is formed and they find other members are chosen whilst they are on the high seas But if the writs and members arrive together here is at best a new trial of skill amongst the candidates after one set of them have well aired themselves with their two voyages of miles  HOWEVER in order to facilitate every thing to the author we will suppose them all once more elected and steering again to Old England with a good heart and a fair westerly wind in their stern On their arrival they find all in a hurry and bustle in and out condolance and congratulation the crown is demised Another parliament is to be called Away back to America again on a fourth voyage and to a third election Does the author mean to make our kings as immortal in their personal as in their politic character or whilst he bountifully adds to their life will he take from them their prerogative of dissolving parliaments in favour of the American union or are the American  representatives to be perpetual and to feel neither demises of the crown nor dissolutions of parliament  BUT these things may be granted to him without bringing him much nearer to his point What does he think of reelection is the American member the only one who is not to take a place or the only one to be exempted from the ceremony of reelection How will this great politician preserve the rights of electors the fairness of returns and the privilege of the house of commons as the sole judge of such contests It would undoubtedly be a glorious sight to have eight or ten petitions or double returns from Boston and Barbadoes from Philadelphia and Jamaica the members returned and the petitioners with all their train of attornies solicitors mayors selectmen provostmarshals and about five hundred or a thousand witnesses come to the bar of the house of commons Possibly we might be interrupted in the enjoyment of this pleasing spectacle if a war should break out and our constitutional fleet loaded with members of parliament returning officers petitioners and witnesses the electors and elected should become a prize to the French or Spaniards and be conveyed to Carthagena or to La Vera Cruz and from thence perhaps to Mexico or Lima there to remain until a cartel for members of parliament can be settled or until the war is ended  IN truth the author has little studied this business or he might have known that some of the most considerable provinces of America such for instance as Connecticut and Massachussett's Bay have not in each of them two men who can afford at a distance from their estates to spend a thousand pounds a year How can these provinces be represented at Westminster If their province pays  them they are American agents with salaries and not independent members of parliament It is true that formerly in England members had salaries from their constituents but they all had salaries and were all in this way upon a par If these American representatives have no salaries then they must add to the list of our pensioners and dependants at court or they must starve There is no alternative  ENOUGH of this visionary union in which much extravagance appears without any fancy and the judgment is shocked without any thing to refresh the imagination It looks as if the author had dropped down from the moon without any knowledge of the general nature of this globe of the general nature of its inhabitants without the least acquaintance with the affairs of this country Governal Pownal has handled the same subject To do him justice he treats it upon far more rational principles of speculation and much more like a man of business He thinks erroneously I conceive but he does think that our legislative rights are incomplete without such a representation It is no wonder therefore that he endeavours by every means to obtain it Not like our author who is always on velvet he is aware of some difficulties and he proposes some solutions But nature is too hard for both these authors and America is and ever will be without actual representation in the house of commons nor will any minister be wild enough even to propose such a representation in parliament however he may choose to throw out that project together with others equally far from his real opinions and remote from his designs merely to fall in with the different views and captivate the affections of different sorts of men  WHETHER these projects arise from the author's real political principles or are only brought out in subservience to his political views they compose the whole of any thing that is like precise and definite which the author has given us to expect from that administration which is so much the subject of his praises and prayers As to his general propositions that  "there is a deal of difference between impossibilities and great difficulties" that "a great scheme cannot be carried unless made the business of successive administrations" that "virtuous and able men are the fittest to serve their country"  all this I look on as no more than so much rubble to fill up the spaces between the regular masonry Pretty much in the same light I cannot forbear considering his detached observations on commerce such as that  P  "the system for colony regulations would be very simple and mutually beneficial to Great Britain and her colonies if the old navigation laws were adhered to" That "the transportation should be in all cases in ships belonging to British subjects" That "even British ships should not be  generally  received into the colonies from any part of Europe except the dominions of Great Britain"That "it is unreasonable that corn and such like products should be restrained to come first to a British port"  What do all these fine observations signify some of them condemn as ill practices things that were never practised at all Some recommend to be done things that always have been done Others indeed convey though obliquely and loosely some insinuations highly dangerous to our commerce If I could prevail on myself to think the author meant to ground any practice upon these general propositions I should think it very necessary to ask a few questions about  some of them For instance what does he mean by talking of an adherence to the old navigation laws does he mean that the particular law Car II c commonly called  "The act of navigation"  is to be adhered to and that the several subsequent additions amendments and exceptions ought to be all repealed If so he will make a strange havock in the whole system of our trade laws which have been universally acknowledged to be full as well founded in the alterations and exceptions as the act of Charles the second in the original provisions and to pursue full as wisely the great end of that very politic law the encrease of the British navigation I fancy the writer could hardly propose any thing more alarming to those immediately interested in that navigation than such a repeal If he does not mean this he has got no farther than a nugatory proposition which nobody can contradict and for which no man is the wiser  THAT  "the regulations for the colony trade would be few and simple if the old navigationlaws were adhered to"  I utterly deny as a fact That they ought to be so sounds well enough but this proposition is of the same nugatory nature with some of the former The regulations for the colony trade ought not to be more nor fewer nor more or less complex than the occasion requires And as that trade is in a great measure a system of art and restriction they can neither be few nor simple It is true that the very principle may be destroyed by multiplying to excess the means of securing it Never did a minister depart more from the author's ideas of simplicity or more embarrass the trade of America with the multiplicity and intricacy of regulations and ordinances than his boasted minister of That minister seemed  to be possessed with something hardly short of a rage for regulation and restriction He had so multiplied bonds certificates affidavits warrants sufferances and cockets had supported them with such severe penalties and extended them without the least consideration of circumstances to so many objects that had they all continued in their original force commerce must speedily have expired under them Some of them the ministry which gave them birth was obliged to destroy with their own hand they signed the condemnation of their own regulations confessing in so many words in the preamble of their act of the th Geo III that some of these regulations had laid  an unnecessary restraint on the trade and correspondence of his Majesty's American subjects  This in that ministry was a candid confession of a mistake but every alteration made in those regulations by their successors is to be the effect of envy and American misrepresentation So much for the author's simplicity in regulation  I HAVE now gone through all which I think immediately essential in the author's ideas of war of peace of the comparative states of England and France of our actual situation in his projects of oeconomy of finance of commerce and of constitutional improvement There remains nothing now to be considered except his heavy censures upon the administration which was formed in which is commonly known by the name of the marquis of Rockingham's administration as the administration which preceded it is by that of Mr Grenville These censures relate chiefly to three heads To the repeal of the American stamp act To the commercial regulations then made To the course of foreign negotiations during that short period  A PERSON who knew nothing of public affairs but from the writings of this author would be led to conclude that at the time of the change in June some well digested system of administration founded in national strength and in the affections of the people proceeding in all points with the most reverential and tender regard to the laws and pursuing with equal wisdom and success every thing which could tend to the internal prosperity and to the external honour and dignity of this country had been all at once subverted by an irruption of a sort of wild licentious unprincipled invaders who wantonly and with a barbarous rage had defaced a thousand fair monuments of the constitutional and political skill of their predecessors It is natural indeed that this author should have some dislike to the administration which was formed in Its views in most things were different from those of his friends in some altogether opposite to them It is impossible that both of these administrations should be the objects of public esteem Their different principles compose some of the strongest political lines which discriminate the parties even now subsisting amongst us The ministers of are not indeed followed by very many in their oppositions yet a large part of the people now in office entertain or pretend to entertain sentiments entirely conformable to theirs whilst some of the former colleagues of the ministry which was formed in however they may have abandoned the connexion and contradicted by their conduct the principles of their former friends pretend on their parts still to adhere to the same maxims All the lesser divisions which are indeed rather names of personal attachment than of party distinction fall in with the one or the other of these leading parties  I INTEND to state as shortly as I am able the general condition of public affairs and the disposition of the minds of men at the time of the remarkable change of system in The reader will have thereby a more distinct view of the comparative merits of these several plans and will receive more satisfaction concerning the ground and reason of the measures which were then pursued than I believe can be derived from the perusal of those partial representations contained in The State of the Nation and the other writings of those who have continued for now near three years in the undisturbed possession of the press This will I hope be some apology for my dwelling a little on this part of the subject  ON the resignation of the earl of Bute in our affairs had been delivered into the hands of three ministers of his recommendation Mr Grenville the earl of Egremont and the earl of Halifax This arrangement notwithstanding the retirement of lord Bute announced to the public a continuance of the same measures nor was there more reason to expect a change from the death of the earl of Egremont The earl of Sandwich supplied his place The duke of Bedford and the gentlemen who acted in that connexion and whose general character and politics were sufficiently understood added to the strength of the ministry without making any alteration in their plan of conduct Such was the constitution of the ministry which was changed in  AS to their politics the principles of the peace of Paris governed in foreign affairs In domestic the same scheme prevailed of contradicting the opinions and disgracing most of the persons who had been countenanced and employed in the late reign The inclinations of the people were little attended  to and a disposition to the use of forcible methods ran through the whole tenour of administration The nation in general was uneasy and dissatisfied Sober men say causes for it in the constitution of the ministry and the conduct of the ministers The ministers who have usually a short method on such occasions attributed their unpopularity wholly to the efforts of faction However this might be the licentiousness and tumults of the common people and the contempt of government of which our author so often and so bitterly complains as owing to the mismanagement of the subsequent administrations had at no time risen to a greater or a more dangerous height The measures taken to suppress that spirit were as violent and licentious as the spirit itself injudicious precipitate and some of them illegal Instead of allaying they tended infinitely to inflame the distemper and whoever will be at the least pains to examine will find those measures not only the causes of the tumults which then prevailed but the real sources of almost all the disorders which have arisen since that time More intent on making a victim to party than an example of justice they blundered in the method of pursuing their vengeance By this means a discovery was made of many practices common indeed in the office of secretary of state but wholly repugnant to our laws and the genius of the English constitution One of the worst of these was the wanton and indiscriminate seizure of papers even in cases where the safety of the state was not pretended in justification of so harsh a proceeding The temper of the ministry had excited a jealousy which made the people more than commonly vigilant concerning every power which was exercised by government The abuse however sanctioned by custom was evident but the ministry instead of resting in a prudent inactivity or what would  have been still more prudent taking the lead in quieting the minds of the people and ascertaining the law upon those delicate points made use of the whole influence of government to prevent a parliamentary resolution against these practices of office And lest the colourable reasons offered in argument against this parliamentary procedure should be mistaken for the real motives of their conduct all the advantage of privilege all the arts and finesses of pleading and great sums of public money were lavished to prevent any decision upon those practices in the courts of justice In the mean time in order to weaken since they could not immediately destroy the liberty of the press the privilege of parliament was voted away in all accusations for a seditious libel The freedom of debate in parliament itself was no less menaced Officers of the army of long and meritorious service and of small fortunes were chosen as victims for a single vote by an exertion of ministerial power which had been very rarely used and which is extremely unjust as depriving men not only of a place but a profession and is indeed of the most pernicious example both in a civil and a military light  WHILST all things were managed at home with such a spirit of disorderly despotism abroad there was a proportionable abatement of all spirit Some of our most just and valuable claims were in a manner abandoned This indeed seemed not very inconsistent conduct in the ministers who had made the treaty of Paris With regard to our domestic affairs there was no want of industry but there was a great deficiency of temper and judgment and manly comprehension of the public interest The nation certainly wanted relief and government attempted to administer it Two ways were principally chosen for this great purpose The  first by regulation the second by new funds of revenue Agreeably to this plan a new naval establishment was formed at a good deal of expence and to little effect to aid in the collection of the customs Regulation was added to regulation and the strictest and most unreserved orders were given for a prevention of all contraband trade here and in every part of America A teazing customhouse and a multiplicity of perplexing regulations ever have and ever will appear the masterpiece of finance to people of narrow views as a paper against smuggling and the importation of French finery never fails of furnishing a very popular column in a newspaper  THE greatest part of these regulations were made for America and they fell so indiscriminately on all sorts of contraband or supposed contraband that some of the most valuable branches of trade were driven violently from our ports which caused an universal consternation throughout the colonies Every part of the trade was infinitely distressed by them Men of war now for the first time armed with regular commissions of customhouse officers invested the coasts and gave to the collection of revenue the air of hostile contribution About the same time that these regulations seemed to threaten the destruction of the only trade from whence the plantations derived any specie an act was made putting a stop to the future emission of paper currency which used to supply its place among them Hand in hand with this went another act for obliging the colonies to provide quarters for soldiers Instantly followed another law for levying throughout all America new port duties upon a vast variety of commodities of their consumption and some of which lay heavy upon objects necessary for their trade and fishery Immediately upon the  heels of these and amidst the uneasiness and confusion produced by a crowd of new impositions and regulations some good some evil some doubtful all crude and illconsidered came another act for imposing an universal stamp duty on the colonies and this was declared to be little more than an experiment and a foundation of future revenue To render these proceedings the more irritating to the colonies the principal argument used in favour of their ability to pay such duties was the liberality of the grants of their assemblies during the late war Never could any argument be more insulting and mortifying to a people habituated to the granting of their own money  TAXES for the purpose of raising revenue had hitherto been sparingly attempted in America Without ever doubting the extent of its lawful power parliament always doubted the propriety of such impositions And the Americans on their part never thought of contesting a right by which they were so little affected Their assemblies in the main answered all the purposes necessary to the internal oeconomy of a free people and provided for all the exigencies of government which arose amongst themselves In the midst of that happy enjoyment they never thought of critically settling the exact limits of a power which was necessary to their union their safety their equality and even their liberty Thus the two very difficult points superiority in the presiding state and freedom in the subordinate were on the whole sufficiently that is practically reconciled without agitating those vexatious questions which in truth rather belong to metaphysics than politics and which can never be moved without shaking the foundations of the best governments that have ever been constituted by human wisdom By this measure was let  loose that dangerous spirit of disquisition not in the coolness of philosophical enquiry but enflamed with all the passions of an haughty resentful people who thought themselves deeply injured and that they were contending for every thing that was valuable in the world  IN England our ministers went on without the least attention to these alarming dispositions just as if they were doing the most common things in the most usual way and among a people not only passive but pleased They took no one step to divert the dangerous spirit which began even then to appear in the colonies to compromise with it to mollify it or to subdue it No new arrangements were made in civil government no new powers or instructions were given to governors no augmentation was made or new disposition of forces Never was so critical a measure pursued with so little provision against its necessary consequences As if all common prudence had abandoned the ministers and as if they meant to plunge themselves and us headlong into that gulph which stood gaping before them by giving a year's notice of the project of their stampact they allowed time for all the discontents of that country to fester and come to a head and for all the arrangements which factious men could make towards an opposition to the law At the same time they carefully concealed from the eye of parliament those remonstrances which they had actually received and which in the strongest manner indicated the discontent of some of the colonies and the consequences which might be expected they concealed them even in defiance of an order of council that they should be laid before parliament Thus by concealing the true state of the case they rendered the wisdom of the nation as improvident as their own temerity  either in preventing or guarding against the mischief It has indeed from the beginning to this hour been the uniform policy of this set of men in order at any hazard to obtain a present credit to propose whatever might be pleasing as attended with no difficulty and afterwards to throw all the disappointment of the wild expectations they had raised upon those who have the hard task of freeing the public from the consequences of their pernicious projects  WHILST the commerce and tranquillity of the whole empire were shaken in this manner our affairs grew still more distracted by the internal dissensions of our ministers Treachery and ingratitude was charged from one side despotism and tyranny from the other the vertigo of the regency bill the aukward reception of the silk bill in the house of commons and the inconsiderate and abrupt rejection of it in the house of lords the strange and violent tumults which arose in consequence and which were rendered more serious by being charged by the ministers upon one another the report of a gross and brutal treatment of the by a ministry at the same time odious to the people all conspired to leave the public at the close of the session of in as critical and perilous a situation as ever the nation was or could be in a time when she was not immediately threatened by her neighbours  IT was at this time and in these circumstances that a new administration was formed Professing even industriously in this public matter to avoid anecdotes I say nothing of those famous reconciliations and quarrels which weakened the body that should have been the natural support of this administration I run no risk in affirming that surrounded as they were with difficulties of every  species nothing but the strongest and most uncorrupt sense of their duty to the public could have prevailed upon some of the persons who composed it to undertake the king's business at such a time Their preceding character their measures while in power and the subsequent conduct of many of them I think leave no room to charge this assertion to flattery Having undertaken the commonwealth what remained for them to do to piece their conduct upon the broken chain of former measures If they had been so inclined the ruinous nature of those measures which began instantly to appear would not have permitted it Scarcely had they entered into office when letters arrived from all parts of America making loud complaints backed by strong reasons against several of the principal regulations of the late ministry as threatening destruction to many valuable branches of commerce These were attended with representations from many merchants and capital manufacturers at home who had all their interests involved in the support of lawful trade and in the suppression of every sort of contraband Whilst these things were under consideration that conflagration blazed out at once in North America an universal disobedience and open resistance to the stamp act and in consequence an universal stop to the course of justice and to trade and navigation throughout that great important country an interval during which the trading interest of England lay under the most dreadful anxiety which it ever felt  THE repeal of that act was proposed It was much too serious a measure and attended with too many difficulties upon every side for the then ministry to have undertaken it as some paltry writers have asserted from envy and dislike to their predecessors in office As little could it be owing to  personal cowardice and dread of consequences to themselves Ministers timorous from their attachment to place and power will fear more from the consequences of one court intrigue than from a thousand difficulties to the commerce and credit of their country by disturbances at three thousand miles distance From which of these the ministers had most to apprehend at that time is known I presume universally Nor did they take that resolution from a want of the fullest sense of the inconveniencies which must necessarily attend a measure of concession from the sovereign to the subject That it must increase the insolence of the mutinous spirits in America was but too obvious No great measure indeed at a very difficult crisis can be pursued which is not attended with some mischief none but conceited pretenders in public business will hold any other language and none but weak and unexperienced men will believe them if they should If we were found in such a crisis let those whose bold designs and whose defective arrangements brought us into it answer for the consequences The business of the then ministry evidently was to take such steps not as the wishes of our author or as their own wishes dictated but as the bad situation in which their predecessors had left them absolutely required  THE disobedience to this act was universal throughout America nothing it was evident but the sending a very strong military backed by a very strong naval force would reduce the seditious to obedience To send it to one town would not be sufficient every province of America must be traversed and must be subdued I do not entertain the least doubt but this could be done We might I think without much difficulty have destroyed our colonies This destruction might be  effected probably in a year or in two at the utmost If the question was upon a foreign nation where every successful stroke adds to your own power and takes from that of a rival a just war with such a certain superiority would be undoubtedly an advisable measure But  four million  of debt due to our merchants the total cessation of a trade annually worth  four million  more a large foreign traffic much home manufacture a very capital immediate revenue arising from colony imports indeed the produce of every one of our revenues greatly depending on this trade all these were very weighty accumulated considerations at least well to be weighed before that sword was drawn which even by its victories must produce all the evil effects of the greatest national defeat How public credit must have suffered I need not say If the condition of the nation at the close of our foreign war was what this author represents it such a civil war would have been a bad couch on which to repose our wearied virtue Far from being able to have entered into new plans of oeconomy we must have launched into a new sea I fear a boundless sea of expence Such an addition of debt with such a diminution of revenue and trade would have left us in no want of a  State of the nation  to aggravate the picture of our distresses  OUR trade felt this to its vitals and our then ministers were not ashamed to say that they sympathized with the feelings of our merchants The universal alarm of the whole trading body of England will never be laughed at by them as an illgrounded or a pretended panic The universal desire of that body will always have great weight with them in every consideration connected with commerce neither ought the opinion of that body to be slighted notwithstanding the contemptuous  and indecent language of this author and his associates in any consideration whatsoever of revenue Nothing amongst us is more quickly or deeply affected by taxes of any kind than trade and if an American tax was a real relief to England no part of the community would be sooner or more materially relieved by it than our merchants But they well know that the trade of England must be more burthened by one penny raised in America than by three in England and if that penny be raised with the uneasiness the discontent and the confusion of America more than by ten  IF the opinion and wish of the landed interest is a motive and it is a fair and just one for taking away a real and large revenue the desire of the trading interest of England ought to be a just ground for taking away a tax of little better than speculation which was to be collected by a war which was to be kept up with the perpetual discontent of those who were to be affected by it and the value of whose produce even after the  ordinary  charges of collection was very uncertain  It is observable that the partizans of American taxation when they have a mind to represent this tax as wonderfully beneficial to England state it as worth £ a year when they are to represent it as very light on the Americans it dwindles to £ Indeed it is very difficult to compute what its produce might have been  after the  extraordinary  the dearest purchased revenue that ever was made by any nation  THESE were some of the motives drawn from principles of convenience for that repeal When the object came to be more narrowly inspected every motive concurred These colonies were evidently founded in subservience to the commerce of Great Britain From this principle the whole system of our laws concerning them became a system  of restriction A double monopoly was established on the part of the parent country a monopoly of their whole import which is to be altogether from Great Britain a monopoly of all their export which is to be no where but to Great Britain as far as it can serve any purpose here On the same idea it was contrived that they should send all their products to us raw and in their first state and that they should take every thing from us in the last stage of manufacture  WERE ever a people under such circumstances that is a people who were to export raw and to receive manufactured and this not a few luxurious articles but all articles even to those of the grossest most vulgar and necessary consumption a people who were in the hands of a general monopolist were ever such a people suspected of a possibility of becoming a just object of revenue All the ends of their foundation must be supposed utterly contradicted before they could become such an object Every tradelaw we have made must have been eluded and become useless before they could be in such a condition  THE partizans of the new system who on most occasions take credit for full as much knowledge as they possess think proper on this occasion to counterfeit an extraordinary degree of ignorance and in consequence of it to assert  "that the balance between the colonies and Great Britain is unknown and that no important conclusion can be drawn from premises so very uncertain"  Consid p  Now to what can this ignorance be owing were the navigation laws made that this balance should be unknown is it from the course of exchange that it is unknown which all the world knows to be greatly and perpetually against the colonies is it  from the doubtful nature of the trade we carry on with the colonies are not these schemists well apprized that the colonists particularly those of the northern provinces import more from Great Britain ten times more than they send in return to us that a great part of their foreign balance is and must be remitted to London I shall be ready to admit that the colonies ought to be taxed to the revenues of this country when I know that they are out of debt to its commerce This author will furnish some ground to his theories and communicate a discovery to the public if he can shew this by any medium But he tells us  Consid p  that  "their seas are covered with ships and their rivers floating with commerce"  This is true But it is with  our  ships that these seas are covered and their rivers float with British commerce The American merchants are our factors all in reality most even in name The Americans trade navigate cultivate with English capitals to their own advantage to be sure for without these capitals their ploughs would be stopped and their ships windbound But he who furnishes the capital must on the whole be the person principally benefited the person who works upon it profits on his part too but he profits in a subordinate way as our colonies do that is as the servant of a wise and indulgent master and no otherwise We have all except the  peculium  without which even slaves will not labour  IF the author's principles which are the common notions be right that the price of our manufactures is so greatly enhanced by our taxes then the Americans already pay in that way a share of our impositions He is not ashamed to assert that  "France and China may be said on the same  principle to bear a part of our charges for they consume our commodities"  Consid p  Was ever such a method of reasoning heard of Do not the laws absolutely confine the colonies to buy from us whether foreign nations sell cheaper or not On what other idea are all our prohibitions regulations guards penalties and forfeitures framed To secure to us not a commercial preference which stands in need of no penalties to enforce it it finds its own way but to secure to us a trade which is a creature of law and institution What has this to do with the principles of a foreign trade which is under no monopoly and in which we cannot raise the price of our goods without hazarding the demand for them None but the authors of such measures could ever think of making use of such arguments  WHOEVER goes about to reason on any part of the policy of this country with regard to America upon the mere abstract principles of government or even upon those of our own antient constitution will be often misled Those who resort for arguments to the most respectable authorities antient or modern or rest upon the clearest maxims drawn from the experience of other states and empires will be liable to the greatest errors imaginable The object is wholly new in the world It is singular it is grown up to this magnitude and importance within the memory of man nothing in history is parallel to it All the reasonings about it that are likely to be at all solid must be drawn from its actual circumstances In this new system a principle of commerce of artificial commerce must predominate This commerce must be secured by a multitude of restraints very alien from the spirit of liberty and a powerful authority must  reside in the principal state in order to enforce them But the people who are to be subjects of these restraints are descendants of Englishmen and of an high and free spirit To hold over them a government made up of nothing but restraints and penalties and taxes in the granting of which they can have no share will neither be wise nor long practicable People must be governed in a manner agreeable to their temper and disposition and men of free character and spirit must be ruled with at least some condescension to this spirit and this character The British colonist must see something which will distinguish him from the colonists of other nations  THOSE reasonings which infer from the many restraints under which we have already laid America to our right to lay it under still more and indeed under all manner of restraints are conclusive conclusive as to right but the very reverse as to policy and practice We ought rather to infer from our having laid the colonies under many restraints that it is reasonable to compensate them by every indulgence that can by any means be reconciled to our interest We have a great empire to rule composed of a vast mass of heterogeneous governments all more or less free and popular in their forms all to be kept in peace and kept out of conspiracy with one another all to be held in subordination to this country while the spirit of an extensive and intricate trading interest pervades the whole always qualifying and often controlling every general idea of constitution and government It is a great and difficult object and I wish we may possess wisdom and temper enough to manage it as we ought Its importance is infinite I believe the reader will be struck as I have been with one singular fact In the year but sixtyfive  years ago the whole trade with our plantations was but a few thousand pounds more in the export article and a third less in the import than that which we now carry on with the single island of Jamaica     Exports  Imports     £  £  Total English plantations in      Jamaica      FROM the same information I find that our dealing with most of the European nations is but little encreased these nations have been pretty much at a stand since that time and we have rivals in their trade This colony intercourse is a new world of commerce in a manner created it stands upon principles of its own principles hardly worth endangering for any little consideration of extorted revenue  THE reader sees that I do not enter so fully into this matter as obviously I might I have already been led into greater lengths than I intended It is enough to say that before the ministers of had determined to propose the repeal of the stamp act in parliament they had the whole of the American constitution and commerce very fully before them They considered maturely they decided with wisdom let me add with firmness For they resolved as a preliminary to that repeal to assert in the fullest and least equivocal terms the unlimited legislative right of this country over its colonies and having done this to propose the repeal on principles not of constitutional right but on those of expediency of equity of lenity and of the true interests present and future  of that great object for which alone the colonies were founded navigation and commerce This plan I say required an uncommon degree of firmness when we consider that some of those persons who might be of the greatest use in promoting the repeal violently withstood the declaratory act and they who agreed with administration in the principles of that law equally made as well the reasons on which the declaratory act itself stood as those on which it was opposed grounds for an opposition to the repeal  IF the then ministry resolved first to declare the right it was not from any opinion they entertained of its future use in regular taxation Their opinions were full and declared against the ordinary use of such a power But it was plain that the general reasonings which were employed against that power went directly to our whole legislative right and one part of it could not be yielded to such arguments without a virtual surrender of all the rest Besides if that very specific power of levying money in the colonies were not retained as a sacred trust in the hands of Great Britain to be used not in the first instance for supply but in the last exigence for controul it is obvious that the presiding authority of Great Britain as the head the arbiter and director of the whole empire would vanish into an empty name without operation or energy With the habitual exercise of such a power in the ordinary course of supply no trace of freedom could remain to America  I do not here enter into the unsatisfactory disquisition concerning representation real or presumed I only say that a great people who have their property without any reserve in all cases d  sposed of by another people at an immense distance from them will not think themselves in the enjoyment of freedom It will be hard to shew to those who are in such a state which of the usual parts of the definition or description of a free people are applicable to them and it is neither pleasant nor wise to attempt to prove that they have no right to be comprehended in such a description  If  Great Britain were stripped of this right every principle of unity and subordination in the empire was gone for ever Whether all this can be reconciled in legal speculation is a matter of no consequence It is reconciled in policy and politics ought to be adjusted not to human reasonings but to human nature of which the reason is but a part and by no means the greatest part  FOUNDING the repeal on this basis it was judged proper to lay before parliament the whole detail of the American affairs as fully as it had been laid before the ministry themselves Ignorance of those affairs had misled parliament Knowledge alone could bring it into the right road Every paper of office was laid upon the table of the two houses every denomination of men either of America or connected with it by office by residence by commerce by interest even by injury men of civil and military capacity officers of the revenue merchants manufacturers of every species and from every town in England attended at the bar Such evidence never was laid before parliament If an emulation arose among the ministers and members of parliament as the author rightly observes  P  for the repeal of this act as well as for the other regulations it was not on the confident assertions the airy speculations or the vain promises of ministers that it arose It was the sense of parliament on the evidence before them No one so much as suspects that ministerial allurements or terrors had any share in it  OUR author is very much displeased that so much credit was given to the testimony of merchants He has an habit of railing at them and he may if he pleases indulge himself in it It will not do great mischief to that respectable set of men The substance of their testimony was that their debts in America were very great That the Americans declined to pay them or to renew their orders whilst this act continued That under these circumstances they despaired of the recovery of their debts or the renewal of their trade in that country That they apprehended a general failure of mercantile credit The manufacturers deposed to the same general purpose with this addition that many of them had discharged several of their artificers and if the law and the resistance to it should continue must dismiss them all  THIS testimony is treated with great contempt by our author It must be I suppose because it was contradicted by the plain nature of things Suppose then that the merchants had to gratify this author given a contrary evidence and had deposed that while America remained in a state of resistance whilst four million of debt remained unpaid whilst the course of justice was suspended for want of stamp paper so that no debt could be recovered whilst there was a total stop to trade because every ship was subject to seizure for want of stamped clearances and while the colonies were to be declared in rebellion and subdued by armed force that in these circumstances they would still continue to trade chearfully and fearlessly as before would not such witnesses provoke universal indignation for their folly or their wickedness and be deservedly hooted from the bar  Here the author has a note altogether in his usual strain of reasoning he finds out that somebody in the course of this multifarious evidence had said  "that a very considerable part of the orders of transmitted from America had been afterwards suspended but that in case the stamp act was repealed those orders were to be executed in the present year "  and that on the repeal of the stamp act  "the exports to the colonies would be at least double the value of the exports of the past year"  He then triumphs exceedingly on their having fallen short of it on the state of the customhouse entries I do not well know what conclusion he draws applicable to his purpose from these facts He does not deny that all the orders which came from America subsequent to the disturbances of the stamp act were on the condition of that act being repealed and he does not assert that notwithstanding that act should be enforced by a strong hand still the orders would be executed Neither does he quite venture to say that this decline of the trade in was owing to the repeal What does he therefore infer from it favourable to the enforcement of that law It only comes to this and no more those merchants who thought our trade would be doubled in the subsequent year were mistaken in their speculations So that the stamp act was not to be repealed unless this speculation of theirs was a probable event But it was not repealed in order to double our trade in that year as every body knows whatever some merchants might have said but lest in that year we should have no trade at all The fact is that during the greatest part of the year that is until about the month of October when the accounts of the disturbances came thick upon us the American trade went on as usual Before this time the stamp act could not affect it Afterwards the merchants fell into a great consternation a general stagnation in trade ensued But as soon as it was known that the ministry favoured the repeal of the stamp act several of the bolder merchants ventured to execute their orders others more timid hung back in this manner the trade continued in a state of dreadful fluctuation between the fears of those who had ventured for the event of their boldness and the anxiety of those whose trade was suspended until the royal assent was finally given to the bill of repeal That the trade of was not equal to that of could not be owing to the repeal it arose from quite different causes of which the author seems not to be aware st Our conquests during the war had laid open the trade of the French and Spanish West Indies to our colonies much more largely than they had ever enjoyed it this continued for some time after the peace but at length it was extremely contracted and in some places reduced to nothing Such in particular was the state of Jamaica On the taking the Havannah all the stores of that island were emptied into that place which produced unusual orders for goods for supplying their own consumption as well as for further speculations of trade These ceasing the trade stood on its own bottom This is one cause of the diminished exports to Jamaica and not the childish idea of the author of an impossible contraband from the opening of the ports d The war had brought a great influx of cash into America for the pay and provision of the troops and this an unnatural encrease of trade which as its cause failed must in some degree return to its ancient and natural bounds d When the merchants met from all parts and compared their accounts they were alarmed at the immensity of the debt due to them from America They found that the Americans had over traded their abilities And as they found too that several of them were capable of making the state of political events an excuse for their failure in commercial punctuality many of our merchants in some degree contracted their trade from that moment However it is idle in such an immense mass of trade so liable to fluctuation to infer any thing from such a deficiency as one or even as two hundred thousand pounds In when the disturbances subsided this deficiency was made up again  would any human  faith have given credit to such assertions The testimony of the merchants was necessary for the detail  and to bring the matter home to the feeling of the house as to the general reasons they spoke abundantly for themselves  UPON these principles was the act repealed and it produced all the good effect which was expected from it quiet was restored trade generally returned to its antient channels time and means were furnished for the better strengthening of government there as well as for recovering by judicious measures the affections of the people had that ministry continued or had a ministry succeeded with dispositions to improve that opportunity  SUCH an administration did not succeed Instead of profiting of that season of tranquillity in the very next year they chose to return to measures of the  very same nature with those which had been so solemnly condemned though upon a smaller scale The effects have been correspondent America is again in disorder not indeed in the same degree as formerly nor any thing like it Such good effects have attended the repeal of the stamp act that the colonies have actually paid the taxes and they have sought their redress upon however improper principles not in their own violence as formerly  The disturbances have been in Boston only and were not in consequence of the late duties  but in the experienced benignity of parliament They are not easy indeed nor ever will be so under this author's scheme of taxation but we see no longer the same general fury and confusion which attended their resistance to the stamp act The author may rail at the repeal and those who proposed it as he pleases Those honest men suffer all his obloquy with pleasure in the midst of the quiet which they have been the means of giving to their country and would think his praises for their perseverance in a pernicious scheme a very bad compensation for the disturbance of our peace and the ruin of our commerce Whether the return to the system of for raising a revenue in America the discontents which have ensued in consequence of it the general suspension of the assemblies in consequence of these discontents the use of the military power and the new and dangerous commissions which now hang over them will produce equally good effects is greatly to be doubted Never I fear will this nation and the colonies fall back upon their true centre of gravity and natural point of repose until the ideas of are resumed and steadily pursued  AS to the regulations a great subject of the author's accusation they are of two sorts one of a mixed nature of revenue and trade the other  simply relative to trade With regard to the former I shall observe that in all deliberations concerning America the ideas of that administration were principally these to take trade as the primary end and revenue but as a very subordinate consideration Where trade was likely to suffer they did not hesitate for an instant to prefer it to taxes whose produce at best was contemptible in comparison of the object which they might endanger The other of their principles was to suit the revenue to the object Where the difficulty of collection from the nature of the country and of the revenue establishment is so very notorious it was their policy to hold out as few temptations to smuggling as possible by keeping the duties as nearly as they could on a balance with the risk On these principles they made many alterations in the port duties of both in the mode and in the quantity The author has not attempted to prove them erroneous He complains enough to shew that he is in an ill humour not that his adversaries have done amiss  AS to the regulations which were merely relative to commerce many were then made and they were all made upon this principle that many of the colonies and those some of the most abounding in people were so situated as to have very few means of traffic with this country It became therefore our interest to let them into as much foreign trade as could be given them without interfering with our own and to secure by every method the returns to the mother country Without some such scheme of enlargement it was obvious that any benefit we could expect from these colonies must be extremely limited Accordingly many facilities were given to their trade with the foreign plantations and with the Southern parts of Europe  As to the confining the returns to this country administration saw the mischief and folly of a plan of indiscriminate restraint They applied their remedy to that part where the disease existed and to that only on this idea they established regulations far more likely to check the dangerous clandestine trade with Hamburgh and Holland than this author's friends or any of their predecessors had ever done  THE friends of the author have a method surely a little whimsical in all this sort of discussions They have made an innumerable multitude of commercial regulations at which the trade of England exclaimed with one voice and many of which have been altered on the unanimous opinion of that trade Still they go on just as before in a sort of droning panegyric on themselves talking of these regulations as prodigies of wisdom and instead of appealing to those who are most affected and the best judges they turn round in a perpetual circle of their own reasonings and pretences they hand you over from one of their pamphlets to another  "See" say they "this demonstrated in The Regulations of the colonies"  "See this satisfactorily proved in The Considerations"  By and by we shall have another  "See for this The State of the Nation"  I wish to take another method in vindicating the opposite system I refer to the petitions of merchants for these regulations to their thanks when they were obtained and to the strong and grateful sense they have ever since expressed of the benefits received under that administration  ALL administrations have in their commercial regulations been generally aided by the opinion of some merchants too frequently by that of a few and those a sort of favourites they have been directed by the opinion of one or two merchants who  were to merit in flatteries and to be paid in contracts who frequently advised not for the general good of trade but for their private advantage During the administration of which this author complains the meetings of merchants upon the business of trade were numerous and public sometimes at the house of the marquis of Rockingham sometimes at Mr Dowdeswell's sometimes at sir George Savile's an house always open to every deliberation favourable to the liberty or the commerce of his country Nor were these meetings confined to the merchants of London Merchants and manufacturers were invited from all the considerable towns of England They conferred with the ministers and active members of parliament No private views no local interests prevailed Never were points in trade settled upon a larger scale of information They who attended these meetings well know what ministers they were who heard the most patiently who comprehended the most clearly and who provided the most wisely Let then this author and his friends still continue in possession of the practice of exalting their own abilities in their pamphlets and in the newspapers They never will perswade the public that the merchants of England were in a general confederacy to sacrifice their own interests to those of North America and to destroy the vent of their own goods in favour of the manufactures of France and Holland  HAD the friends of this author taken these means of information his extreme terrors of contraband in the West India islands would have been greatly quieted and his objections to the opening of the ports would have ceased He would have learned from the most satisfactory analysis of the West India trade that we have the advantage in every essential  article of it and that almost every restriction on our communication with our neighbours there is a restriction unfavourable to ourselves  SUCH were the principles that guided and the authority that sanctioned these regulations No man ever said that in the multiplicity of regulations made in the administration of their predecessors none were useful some certainly were so and I defy the author to shew a commercial regulation of that period which he can prove from any authority except his own to have a tendency beneficial to commerce that has been repealed So far were that ministry from being guided by a spirit of contradiction or of innovation  THE author's attack on that administration for their neglect of our claims on foreign powers is by much the most astonishing instance he has given or that I believe any man ever did give of an intrepid effrontery It relates to the Manilla ransom to the Canada bills and to the Russian treaty Could one imagine that these very things which he thus chooses to object to others have been the principal subjects of charge against his favourite ministry Instead of clearing them of these charges he appears not so much as to have heard of them but throws them directly upon the administration which succeeded to that of his friends  IT is not always very pleasant to be obliged to produce the detail of this kind of transactions to the public view I will content myself therefore with giving a short state of facts which when the author chooses to contradict he shall see proved more perhaps to his conviction than to his liking The first fact then is that the demand for the Manilla ransom had been in the author's favourite administration so neglected as to appear to have been  little less than tacitly abandoned At home no countenance was given to the claimants and when it was mentioned in parliament the then leader did not seem at least  a very sanguine advocate in favour of the claim  These things made it a matter of no small difficulty to resume and press that negotiation with Spain However so clear was our right that the then ministers resolved to revive it and so little time was lost that though that administration was not compleated until the ninth of July on the th of the following August general Conway transmitted a strong and full remonstrance on that subject to the earl of Rochfort The argument on which the court of Madrid most relied was the dereliction of that claim by the preceding ministers However it was still pushed with so much vigour that the Spaniards from a positive denial to pay offered to refer the demand to arbitration That proposition was rejected and the demand being still pressed there was all the reason in the world to expect its being brought to a favourable issue when it was thought proper to change the administration Whether under their circumstances and in the time they continued in power more could be done the reader will judge who will hear with astonishment a charge of remissness from those very men whose inactivity to call it by no worse a name laid the chief difficulties in the way of the revived negotiation  As to the Canada bills this author thinks proper to assert  P  "that the proprietors found themselves under a necessity of compounding their demands upon the French court and accepting terms which they had often rejected and which the earl of Halifax had declared he would sooner forfeit his hand than sign"  When I know that  the earl of Halifax says so the earl of Halifax shall have an answer but I perswade myself that his lordship has given no authority for this ridiculous rant In the mean time I shall only speak of it as a common concern of that ministry  IN the first place then I observe that a convention for the liquidation of the Canada bills was concluded under the administration of when nothing was concluded under that of the favourites of this author  THIS transaction was in every step of it carried on in concert with the persons interested and was terminated to their entire satisfaction They would have acquiesced perhaps in terms somewhat lower than those which were obtained The author is indeed too kind to them He will however let them speak for themselves and shew what their own opinion was of the measures pursued in their favour  "They are happy in having found in your zeal for the dignity of this nation the means of liquidating their claims and of concluding with the court of France a convention for the final satisfaction of their demands and have given us commission in their names and on their behalf most earnestly to intreat your acceptance of their grateful acknowledgmentsWhether they consider themselves as Britons or as men more particularly profiting by your generous and spirited interposition they see great reasons to be thankful for having been supported by a minister in whose public affections in whose wisdom and activity both the national honour and the interest of individuals have been at once so well supported and secured"  Thanks of the Canada merchants to general Conway London April  In what manner the execution of the convention has been since provided for it is not my present business to examine  THE proprietors had absolutely despaired of being paid at any time any proportion of their demand until the change of that ministry The merchants were checked and discountenanced they  had often been told by some in authority of the cheap rate at which these Canada bills had been procured yet the author can talk of the composition of them as a necessity induced by the change in administration They found themselves indeed before that change under a necessity of hinting somewhat of bringing the matter into parliament but they were soon silenced and put in mind of the fate which the Newfoundland business had there met with Nothing struck them more than the strong contrast between the spirit and method of proceeding of the two administrations  THE earl of Halifax never did nor could refuse to sign this convention because this convention as it stands never was before him  See the convention itself printed by Owen and Harrison Warwicklane particularly the articles two and thirteen    THE author's last charge on that ministry with regard to foreign affairs is the Russian treaty of commerce which the author thinks fit to assert was concluded  P  "on terms the earl of Buckinghamshire had refused to accept of and which had been deemed by former ministers disadvantageous to the nation and by the merchants unsafe and unprofitable"  BOTH the assertions in this paragraph are equally groundless The treaty then concluded by sir George Macartney was not on the terms which the earl of Buckinghamshire had refused The earl of Buckinghamshire never did refuse terms because the business never came to the point of refusal or acceptance all that he did was to receive the Russian project for a treaty of commerce and to transmit it to England This was in November and he left Petersburgh the January  following before he could even receive an answer from his own court The conclusion of the treaty fell to his successor Whoever will be at the trouble to compare it with the treaty of will I believe confess that if the former ministers could have obtained such terms they were criminal in not accepting them  BUT the merchants  "deemed them unsafe and unprofitable"  What merchants As no treaty ever was more maturely considered so the opinion of the Russian merchants in London was all along taken and all the instructions sent over were in exact conformity to that opinion Our minister there made no step without having previously consulted our merchants resident in Petersburgh who before the signing of the treaty gave the most full and unanimous testimony in its favour In their address to our minister at that court among other things they say  "It may afford some additional satisfaction to your excellency to receive a public acknowledgment of  the entire and unreserved approbation of every article  in this treaty from us who are so immediately and so nearly concerned in its consequences"  This was signed by the consul general and every British merchant in Petersburgh  THE approbation of those immediately concerned in the consequences is nothing to this author He and his friends have so much tenderness for peoples interests and understand them so much better than they do themselves that whilst these politicians are contending for the best of possible terms the claimants are obliged to go without any terms at all  ONE of the first and justest complaints against the administration of the author's friends was the want  of vigour in their foreign negotiations Their immediate successors endeavoured to correct that error along with others and there was scarcely a foreign court in which the new spirit that had arisen was not sensibly felt acknowledged and sometimes complained of On their coming into administration they found the demolition of Dunkirk entirely at a stand instead of demolition they found construction for the French were then at work on the repair of the jettees On the remonstrances of general Conway some parts of these jettees were immediately destroyed The duke of Richmond personally surveyed the place and obtained a fuller knowledge of its true state and condition than any of our ministers had done and in consequence had larger offers from the duke of Choiseul than had ever been received But as these were short of our just expectations under the treaty he rejected them Our then ministers knowing that in their administration the peoples minds were set at ease upon all the essential points of public and private liberty and that no project of theirs could endanger the concord of the empire were under no restraint from pursuing every just demand upon foreign nations  THE author towards the end of this work falls into reflections upon the state of public morals in this country He draws use from his doctrine by recommending his friend to the King and the public as another duke of Sully and he concludes the whole performance with a very devout prayer  THE prayers of politicians may sometimes be sincere and as this prayer is in substance that the author or his friends may be soon brought into power I have great reason to believe it is very much from the heart It must be owned too that after he has drawn such a picture such a shocking  picture of the state of this country he has great faith in thinking the means he prays for sufficient to relieve us after the character he has given of its inhabitants of all ranks and classes he has great charity in caring much about them and indeed no less hope in being of opinion that such a detestable nation can ever become the care of Providence He has not even found five good men in our devoted city  HE talks indeed of men of virtue and ability But where are his  men  of virtue and ability to be found Are they in the present administration never were a set of people more blackened by this author Are they among the party of those no small body who adhere to the system of these it is the great purpose of this book to calumniate Are they the persons who acted with his great friend since the change in to his removal in scarcely any of these are now out of employment and we are in possession of his desideratum Yet I think he hardly means to select even some of the highest of them as examples fit for the reformation of a corrupt world  HE observes that the virtue of the most exemplary prince that ever swayed a scepter  P  "can never warm or illuminate the body of his people if foul mirrours are placed so near him as to refract and dissipate the rays at their first emanation"  Without observing upon the propriety of this metaphor or asking how mirrours come to have lost their old quality of reflecting and to have acquired that of refracting and dissipating rays and how far their foulness will account for this change the remark itself is common and true no less true and equally surprizing from him is that which immediately  precedes it  P    "it is in vain to endeavour to check the progress of irreligion and licentiousness by punishing such crimes in  one individual  if others equally culpable are rewarded with the honours and emoluments of the state"  I am not in the secret of the author's manner of writing but it appears to me that he must intend these reflections as a satire upon the administration of his happy years Were ever the honours and emoluments of the state more lavishly squandered upon persons scandalous in their lives than during that period In these scandalous lives was there any thing more scandalous than the mode of punishing  one culpable individual  In that individual is any thing more culpable than his having been seduced by the example of some of those very persons by whom he was thus persecuted  THE author is so eager to attack others that he provides but indifferently for his own defence I believe without going beyond the page I have now before me he is very sensible that I have sufficient matter of further and if possible of heavier charge against his friends upon his own principles But it is because the advantage is too great that I decline making use of it I wish the author had not thought that all methods are lawful in party Above all he ought to have taken care not to wound his enemies through the sides of his country This he has done by making that monstrous and overcharged picture of the distresses of our situation No wonder that he who finds this country in the same condition with that of France at the time of Henry the Fourth could also find a resemblance between his political friend and the duke of Sully As to those personal resemblances people will often judge of them from their  affections they may image in these clouds whatsoever figures they please but what is the conformation of that eye which can discover a resemblance of this country and these times to those with which the author compares them France a country just recovered out of twentyfive years of the most cruel and desolating civil war that perhaps was ever known The kingdom under a veil of momentary quiet full of the most atrocious political operating upon the most furious fanatical factions Some pretenders even to the crown and those who did not pretend to the whole aimed at the partition of the monarchy There were almost as many competitors as provinces and all abetted by the greatest the most ambitious and most enterprizing power in Europe No place safe from treason no not the bosoms on which the most amiable prince that ever lived reposed his head not his mistresses not even his queen As to the finances they had scarce an existence but as a matter of plunder to the managers and of grants to insatiable and ungrateful courtiers  HOW can our author have the heart to describe this as any sort of parallel to our situation To be sure an April shower has some resemblance to a waterspout for they are both wet and there is some likeness between a summer evening's breeze and an hurricane they are both wind but who can compare our disturbances our situation or our finances to those of France in the time of Henry Great Britain is indeed at this time wearied but not broken with the efforts of a victorious foreign war not sufficiently relieved by an inadequate peace but somewhat benefited by that peace and infinitely by the consequences of that war The powers of Europe awed by our victories and lying in ruins upon every side of us Burthened  indeed we are with debt but abounding with re+sources We have a trade not perhaps equal to our wishes but more than ever we possessed In effect no pretender to the crown nor nutriment for such desperate and destructive factions as have formerly shaken this kingdom  AS to our finances the author trifles with us When Sully came to those of France in what order was any part of the financial system or what system was there at all There is no man in office who must not be sensible that ours is without the act of any parading minister the most regular and orderly system perhaps that was ever known the best secured against all frauds in the collection and all misapplication in the expenditure of public money  I ADMIT that in this flourishing state of things there are appearances enough to excite uneasiness and apprehension I admit there is a cankerworm in the rose  medio de fonte leporum  Surgit amari aliquid quod in ipsis floribus angat  THIS is nothing else than a spirit of disconnexion of distrust and of treachery amongst public men It is no accidental evil nor has its effect been trusted to the usual frailty of nature the distemper has been inoculated The author is sensible of it and we lament it together This distemper is alone sufficient to take away considerably from the benefits of our constitution and situation and perhaps to render their continuance precarious If these evil dispositions should spread much farther they must end in our destruction for nothing can save a people destitute of public and private faith However the author for the present state of things has extended the charge by much too  widely as men are but too apt to take the measure of all mankind from their own particular acquaintance Barren as this age may be in the growth of honour and virtue the country does not want at this moment as strong and those not a few examples as were ever known of an unshaken adherence to principle and attachment to connexion against every allurement of interest Those examples are not furnished by the great alone nor by those whose activity in public affairs may render it suspected that they make such a character one of the rounds in their ladder of ambition but by men more quiet and more in the shade on whom an unmixed sense of honour alone could operate Such examples indeed are not furnished in great abundance amongst those who are the subjects of the author's panegyric He must look for them in another camp He who complains of the ill effects of a divided and heterogeneous administration is not justifiable in labouring to render odious in the eyes of the public those men whose principles whose maxims of policy and whose personal character can alone administer a remedy to this capital evil of the age neither is he consistent with himself in constantly extolling those whom he knows to be the authors of the very mischief of which he complains and which the whole nation feels so deeply  THE persons who are the objects of his dislike and complaint are many of them of the first families and weightiest properties in the kingdom but infinitely more distinguished for their untainted honour public and private and their zealous but sober attachment to the constitution of their country than they can be by any birth or any station If they are the friends of any one great man rather than another it is not that they make his  aggrandisement the end of their union or because they know him to be the most active in caballing for his connexions the largest and speediest emoluments It is because they know him by personal experience to have wise and enlarged ideas of the public good and an invincible constancy in adhering to it because they are convinced by the whole tenour of his actions that he will never negotiate away their honour or his own and that in or out of power change of situation will make no alteration in his conduct This will give to such a person in such a body an authority and respect that no minister ever enjoyed among his venal dependants in the highest plenitude of his power such as servility never can give such as ambition never can receive or relish  THIS body will often be reproached by their adversaries for want of ability in their political transactions they will be ridiculed for missing many favourable conjunctures and not profiting of several brilliant opportunities of fortune but they must be contented to endure that reproach for they cannot acquire the reputation of  that kind  of ability without losing all the other reputation they possess  THEY will be charged too with a dangerous spirit of exclusion and proscription for being unwilling to mix in schemes of administration which have no bond of union or principle of confidence That charge too they must suffer with patience If the reason of the thing had not spoken loudly enough the miserable examples of the several administrations constructed upon the idea of systematic discord would be enough to frighten them from such monstrous and ruinous conjunctions It is however false that the idea of an united administration carries with it that of a proscription of  any other party It does indeed imply the necessity of having the great strong holds of government in wellunited hands in order to secure the predominance of right and uniform principles of having the capital offices of deliberation and execution in those who can deliberate with mutual confidence and who will execute what is resolved with firmness and fidelity If this system cannot be rigorously adhered to in practice and what system can be so it ought to be the constant aim of good men to approach as nearly to it as possible No system of that kind can be formed which will not leave room fully sufficient for healing coalitions but no coalition which under the specious name of independency carries in its bosom the unreconciled principles of the original discord of parties ever was or will be an healing coalition Nor will the mind of our sovereign ever know repose his kingdom settlement or his business order efficiency or grace with his people until things are established upon the basis of some set of men who are trusted by the public and who can trust one another  THIS comes rather nearer to the mark than the author's description of a proper administration under the name of  men of ability and virtue  which conveys no definite idea at all nor does it apply specifically to our grand national distemper All parties pretend to these qualities The present ministry no favourites of the author will be ready enough to declare themselves persons of virtue and ability and if they choose a vote for that purpose perhaps it would not be quite impossible for them to procure it But if the disease be this distrust and disconnexion it is easy to know who are sound and who are tainted who are fit to restore us to health who to continue and to spread  the contagion The present ministry being made up of draughts from all parties in the kingdom if they should profess any adherence to the connexions they have left they must convict themselves of the blackest treachery They therefore choose rather to renounce the principle itself and to brand it with the name of pride and faction This test with certainty discriminates the opinions of men The other is a description vague and unsatisfactory  AS to the unfortunate gentlemen who may at any time compose that system which under the plausible title of an administration subsists but for the establishment of weakness and confusion they fall into different classes with different merits I think the situation of some people in that state may deserve a certain degree of compassion at the same time that they furnish an example which it is to be hoped by being a severe one will have its effect at least on the growing generation if an original seduction on plausible but hollow pretences into loss of honour friendship consistency security and repose can furnish it It is possible to draw even from the very prosperity of ambition examples of terror and motives to compassion  I BELIEVE the instances are exceedingly rare of mens immediately passing over a clear marked line of virtue into declared vice and corruption There are a sort of middle tints and shades between the two extremes there is something uncertain on the confines of the two empires which they first pass through and which renders the change easy and imperceptible There are even a sort of splendid impositions so well contrived that at the very time the path of rectitude is quitted for ever men seem to be advancing into some higher and nobler road  of public conduct Not that such impositions are strong enough in themselves but a powerful interest often concealed from those whom it affects works at the bottom and secures the operation Men are thus debauched away from those legitimate connexions which they had formed on a judgment early perhaps but sufficiently mature and wholly unbiassed They do not quit them upon any ground of complaint for grounds of just complaint may exist but upon the flattering and most dangerous of all principles that of mending what is well Gradually they are habituated to other company and a change in their habitudes soon makes a way for a change in their opinions Certain persons are no longer so very frightful when they come to be known and to be serviceable As to their old friends the transition is easy from friendship to civility from civility to enmity few are the steps from dereliction to persecution  PEOPLE not very well grounded in the principles of public morality find a set of maxims in office ready made for them which they assume as naturally and inevitably as any of the insignia or instruments of the situation A certain tone of the solid and practical is immediately acquired Every former profession of public spirit is to be considered as a debauch of youth or at best as a visionary scheme of unattainable perfection The very idea of consistency is exploded The convenience of the business of the day is to furnish the principle for doing it Then the whole ministerial cant is quickly got by heart The prevalence of faction is to be lamented All opposition is to be regarded as the effect of envy and disappointed ambition All administrations are declared to be alike The same necessity justifies all their measures  It is no longer a matter of discussion who or what administration is but that administration is to be supported is a general maxim Flattering themselves that their power is become necessary to the support of all order and government every thing which tends to the support of that power is sanctified and becomes a part of the public interest  GROWING every day more formed to affairs and better knit in their limbs when the occasion now the only rule requires it they become capable of sacrificing those very persons to whom they had before sacrificed their original friends It is now only in the ordinary course of business to alter an opinion or to betray a connexion Frequently relinquishing one set of men and adopting another they grow into a total indifference to human feeling as they had before to moral obligation until at length no one original impression remains upon their minds every principle is obliterated every sentiment effaced  IN the mean time that power which all these changes aimed at securing remains still as tottering and as uncertain as ever They are delivered up into the hands of those who feel neither respect for their persons nor gratitude for their favours who are put about them in appearance to serve in reality to govern them and when the signal is given to abandon and destroy them in order to set up some newer dupe of ambition who in his turn is to be abandoned and destroyed Thus living in a state of continual uneasiness and ferment softened only by the miserable consolation of giving now and then preferments to those for whom they have no value they are unhappy in their situation yet find it impossible to resign it Until at length soured in temper and disappointed by the very attainment  of their ends in some angry in some haughty or some negligent moment they incur the displeasure of those upon whom they have rendered their very being dependent Then  perierunt tempora longi servitii  they are cast off with scorn they are turned out emptied of all natural character of all intrinsic worth of all essential dignity and deprived of every consolation of friendship Having rendered all retreat to old principles ridiculous and to old regards impracticable not being able to counterfeit pleasure or to discharge discontent nothing being sincere or right or balanced in their minds it is more than a chance that in the delirium of the last stage of their distempered power they make an insane political testament by which they throw all their remaining weight and consequence into the scale of their declared enemies and the avowed authors of their destruction Thus they finish their course Had it been possible that the whole or even a great part of these effects on their minds I say nothing of the effect upon their fortunes could have appeared to them in their first departure from the right line it is certain they would have rejected every temptation with horror The principle of these remarks like every good principle in morality is trite but its frequent application is not the less necessary  As to others who are plain practical men they have been guiltless at all times of all public pretence Neither the author nor any one else has reason to be angry with them They belonged to his friend for their interest for their interest they quitted him and when it is their interest he may depend upon it they will return to their former connexion Such people subsist at all times and though the nuisance of all are at no time a worthy  subject of discussion It is false virtue and plausible error that do the mischief  IF men come to government with right dispositions they have not that unfavourable subject which this author represents to work upon Our circumstances are indeed critical but then they are the critical circumstances of a strong and mighty nation If corruption and meanness are greatly spread they are not spread universally Many public men are hitherto examples of public spirit and integrity Whole parties as far as large bodies can be uniform have preserved character However they may be deceived in some particulars I know of no set of men amongst us which does not contain persons on whom the nation in a difficult exigence may well value itself Private life which is the nursery of the commonwealth is yet in general pure and on the whole disposed to virtue and the people at large want neither generosity nor spirit No small part of that very luxury which is so much the subject of the author's declamation but which in most parts of life by being well balanced and diffused is only decency and convenience has perhaps as many or more good than evil consequences attending it It certainly excites industry nourishes emulation and inspires some sense of personal value into all ranks of people What we want is to establish more fully an opinion of uniformity and consistency of character in the leading men of the state such as will restore some confidence to profession and appearance such as will fix subordination upon esteem Without this all schemes are begun at the wrong end All who join in them are liable to their consequences All men who under whatever pretext take a part in the formation or the support of systems constructed in such a manner as must in their nature disable them  from the execution of their duty have made themselves guilty of all the present distraction and of the future ruin which they may bring upon their country  IT is a serious affair this studied disunion in government In cases where union is most consulted in the constitution of a ministry and where persons are best disposed to promote it differences from the various ideas of men will arise and from their passions will often ferment into violent heats so as greatly to disorder all public business What must be the consequence when the very distemper is made the basis of the constitution and the original weakness of humane nature is still further enfeebled by art and contrivance It must subvert government from the very foundation It turns our public councils into the most mischievous cabals where the consideration is not how the nation's business shall be carried on but how those who ought to carry it on shall circumvent each other In such a state of things no order uniformity dignity or effect can appear in our proceedings either at home or abroad Nor will it make much difference whether some of the constituent parts of such an administration are men of virtue or ability or not supposing it possible that such men with their eyes open should choose to make a part in such a body  THE effects of all human contrivances are in the hand of Providence I do not like to answer as our author so readily does for the event of any speculation But sure the nature of our disorders if any thing must indicate the proper remedy Men who act steadily on the principles I have stated may in all events be very serviceable to their country in one case by furnishing if their Sovereign should be so advised an administration formed upon ideas very different from those which have for some time  been unfortunately fashionable But if this should not be the case they may be still serviceable for the example of a large body of men steadily sacrificing ambition to principle can never be without use It will certainly be prolific and draw others to an imitation  Vera gloria radices agit atque etiam propagatur  I DO not think myself of consequence enough to imitate my author in troubling the world with the prayers or wishes I may form for the public full as little am I disposed to imitate his professions those professions are long since worn out in the political service If the work will not speak for the author his own declarations deserve but little credit  APPENDIX  SO much misplaced industry has been used by the author of the State of the Nation as well as by other writers to infuse discontent into the people on account of the late war and of the effects of our national debt that nothing ought to be omitted which may tend to disabuse the public upon these subjects When I had gone through the foregoing sheets I recollected that in my pages and I only gave the comparative states of the duties collected by the excise at large together with the quantities of strong beer brewed in the two periods which are there compared It might be still thought that some other articles of popular consumption of general convenience and connected with our manufactures might possibly have declined I therefore now think it right to lay before the reader the state of the produce of three capital duties on such articles duties which have frequently been made the subject of popular complaint The duty on candles that on soap paper c and that on hides        £  Average of net produce of duty on soap c for years ending       Average of ditto for years ending          Average encrease £    Average of net produce of duty on candles for years ending       Average of ditto for years ending          Average encrease £    Average net produce of duty on hides years ending       Ditto years ending          Average encrease £    This encrease has not arisen from any additional duties None have been imposed on these articles during the war Notwithstanding the burthens of the war and the late dearness of provisions the consumption of all these articles has encreased and the revenue along with it  THERE is another point in The State of the Nation to which I fear I have not been so full in my answer as I ought to have been and as I am well warranted to be The author has endeavoured to throw a suspicion or something more on that salutary and indeed necessary measure of opening the ports in Jamaica  His note p  "Orders were given" says he "in  August  for the free admission of Spanish vessels into all the colonies"  He then observes that the exports to Jamaica fell £ short of those of and that the exports of the succeeding year fell short of those of about eighty pounds from whence he wisely infers that this decline of exports being  since  the relaxation of the laws of trade there is a just ground of suspicion that the colonies have been supplied with foreign commodities instead of British  HERE as usual with him the author builds on a fact which is absolutely false and which being so renders his whole hypothesis absurd and impossible He asserts that the order for admitting Spanish vessels was given in  August  That order was not  signed at the treasury board until the    th day of the November following  and therefore so far from affecting the exports of the year that supposing all possible diligence in the commissioners of the customs in expediting that order and every advantage of vessels ready to sail and the most favourable wind it would hardly even arrive in Jamaica within the limits of that year  THIS order could therefore by no possibility be a cause of the decrease of exports in If it had any mischievous operation it could not be before In that year according to our author the exports fell short of the preceding just  eighty  pounds He is welcome to that diminution and to all the consequences he can draw from it  BUT as an auxiliary to account for this dreadful loss he brings in the Freeport act which he observes for his convenience to have been made in spring but for his convenience likewise he forgets that by the express provision of the act the regulation was not to be in force in Jamaica until the November following Miraculous must be the activity of that contraband whose operation in America could before the end of that year have reacted upon England and checked the exportation from hence unless he chooses to suppose that the merchants at whose solicitation this act had been obtained were so frighted at the accomplishment of their own most earnest and anxious desire that before any good or evil effect from it could happen they immediately put a stop to all further exportation  IT is obvious that we must look for the true effect of that act at the time of its first possible operation that is in the year On this idea how stands the account     £  Exports to Jamaica            first year of the Freeport act    This author for the sake of a present momentary credit will hazard any future and permanent disgrace At the time he wrote the account of could not be made up This was the very first year of the trial of the Freeport act and we find that the sale of British commodities is so far from lessened by that act that the exports of amounts to £ more than that of either of the two preceding years and is £ above that of his standard year If I could prevail on myself to argue  in favour of a great commercial scheme from the appearance of things in a single year I should from this encrease of export infer the beneficial effects of that measure In truth it is not wanting Nothing but the thickest ignorance of the Jamaica trade could have made any one entertain a fancy that the least ill effect on our commerce could follow from this opening of the ports But if the author argues the effect of regulations in the American trade from the export of the year in which they are made or even of the following why did he not apply this rule to his own He had the same paper before him which I have now before me He must have seen that in his standard year the year the principal year of his new regulations the export fell no less than £ short of that in Did the export trade revive by these regulations in during which year they continued in their full force It fell about £ still lower Here is a fall of £ to account for which would have become the author much better than piddling for an £ fall in the year the only year in which  the order  he objects to could operate or in presuming a fall of exports from a regulation which took place only in November whose effects could not appear until the following year and which when they do appear utterly overthrow all his flimsy reasons and affected suspicions upon the effect of opening the ports  THIS author in the same paragraph says that  "it was asserted by  the American factors and agents  that the commanders of our ships of war and tenders having customhouse commissions and the strict orders given in for a due execution of the laws of trade in the colonies had deterred the Spaniards from trading with us that the sale of British manufactures in the West Indies had been greatly lessened and the receipt of large sums in specie prevented"  IF the  American factors and agents  asserted this they had good ground for their assertion They knew that the Spanish vessels had been driven from our ports The author does not positively deny the fact If he should it will be  proved When the factors connected this measure and its natural consequences with an actual fall in the exports to Jamaica to no less an amount than £ in one year and with a further fall in the next is their assertion very wonderful The author himself is full as much alarmed by a fall of only £ for giving him the facts which he chuses to coin it is no more The expulsion of the Spanish vessels must certainly have been one cause if not of the first declension of the exports yet of their continuance in their reduced state Other causes had their operation without doubt In what degree each cause produced its effect it is hard to determine But the fact of a fall of exports upon the restraining plan and of a rise upon the taking place of the enlarging plan is established beyond all contradiction  THIS author says that the facts relative to the Spanish trade were asserted by  American factors and agents  insinuating that the ministry of had no better authority for their plan of enlargement than such assertions The moment he chooses it he shall see the very same thing asserted by governors of provinces by commanders of men of war and by officers of the customs persons the most bound in duty to prevent contraband and the most interested in the seizures to be made in consequence of strict regulation I suppress them for the present wishing that the author may not drive me to a more full discussion of this matter than it may be altogether prudent to enter into I wish he had not made any of these discussions necessary  THOUGHTS ON THE CAUSE OF THE PRESENT DISCONTENTS  Hoc vero occultum intestinum domesticum malum non modo non existit verum etiam opprimit antequam perspicere atque explorare potueris  CIC  THOUGHTS ON THE CAUSE OF THE PRESENT DISCONTENTS  IT is an undertaking of some degree of delicacy to examine into the cause of public disorders If a man happens not to succeed in such an enquiry he will be thought weak and visionary if he touches the true grievance there is a danger that he may come near to persons of weight and consequence who will rather be exasperated at the discovery of their errors than thankful for the occasion of correcting them If he should be obliged to blame the favourites of the people he will be considered as the tool of power if he censures those in power he will be looked on as an instrument of faction But in all exertions of duty something is to be hazarded In cases of tumult and disorder our law has invested every man in some sort with the authority of a magistrate When the affairs of the nation are distracted private people are by the spirit of that law justified in stepping a little out of their ordinary sphere They enjoy a privilege of somewhat more dignity and effect than that of idle lamentation over the calamities of their country They may look into them narrowly they  may reason upon them liberally and if they should be so fortunate as to discover the true source of the mischief and to suggest any probable method of removing it though they may displease the rulers for the day they are certainly of service to the cause of government Government is deeply interested in every thing which even through the medium of some temporary uneasiness may tend finally to compose the minds of the subject and to conciliate their affections I have nothing to do here with the abstract value of the voice of the people But as long as reputation the most precious possession of every individual and as long as opinion the great support of the state depend entirely upon that voice it can never be considered as a thing of little consequence either to individuals or to government Nations are not primarily ruled by laws less by violence Whatever original energy may be supposed either in force or regulation the operation of both is in truth merely instrumental Nations are governed by the same methods and on the same principles by which an individual without authority is often able to govern those who are his equals or his superiors by a knowledge of their temper and by a judicious management of it I meanwhen public affairs are steadily and quietly conducted not when government is nothing but a continued scuffle between the magistrate and the multitude in which sometimes the one and sometimes the other is uppermost in which they alternately yield and prevail in a series of contemptible victories and scandalous submissions The temper of the people amongst whom he presides ought therefore to be the first study of a statesman And the knowledge of this temper it is by no means impossible for him to attain if he has not an interest in being ignorant of what it is his duty to learn  TO complain of the age we live in to murmur at the present possessors of power to lament the past to conceive extravagant hopes of the future are the common dispositions of the greatest part of mankind indeed the necessary effects of the ignorance and levity of the vulgar Such complaints and humours have existed in all times yet as all times have  not  been alike true political sagacity manifests itself in distinguishing that complaint which only characterizes the general infirmity of human nature from those which are symptoms of the particular distemperature of our own air and season  NOBODY I believe will consider it merely as the language of spleen or disappointment if I say that there is something particularly alarming in the present conjuncture There is hardly a man in or out of power who holds any other language That government is at once dreaded and contemned that the laws are despoiled of all their respected and salutary terrors that their inaction is a subject of ridicule and their exertion of abhorrence that rank and office and title and all the solemn plausibilities of the world have lost their reverence and effect that our foreign politics are as much deranged as our domestic oeconomy that our dependencies are slackened in their affection and loosened from their obedience that we know neither how to yield nor how to inforce that hardly any thing above or below abroad or at home is sound and intire but that disconnexion and confusion in offices in parties in families in parliament in the nation prevail beyond the disorders of any former time these are facts universally admitted and lamented  THIS state of things is the more extraordinary because the great parties which formerly divided and agitated the kingdom are known to be in a  manner entirely dissolved No great external calamity has visited the nation no pestilence or famine We do not labour at present under any scheme of taxation new or oppressive in the quantity or in the mode Nor are we engaged in unsuccessful war in which our misfortunes might easily pervert our judgment and our minds sore from the loss of national glory might feel every blow of fortune as a crime in government  IT is impossible that the cause of this strange distemper should not sometimes become a subject of discourse It is a compliment due and which I willingly pay to those who administer our affairs to take notice in the first place of their speculation Our ministers are of opinion that the increase of our trade and manufactures that our growth by colonization and by conquest have concurred to accumulate immense wealth in the hands of some individuals and this again being dispersed amongst the people has rendered them universally proud ferocious and ungovernable that the insolence of some from their enormous wealth and the boldness of others from a guilty poverty have rendered them capable of the most atrocious attempts so that they have trampled upon all subordination and violently borne down the unarmed laws of a free government barriers too feeble against the fury of a populace so fierce and licentious as ours They contend that no adequate provocation has been given for so spreading a discontent our affairs having been conducted throughout with remarkable temper and consummate wisdom The wicked industry of some libellers joined to the intrigues of a few disappointed politicians have in their opinion been able to produce this unnatural ferment in the nation  NOTHING indeed can be more unnatural than the present convulsions of this country if the above account be a true one I confess I shall assent to it with great reluctance and only on the compulsion of the clearest and firmest proofs because their account resolves itself into this short but discouraging proposition  "That we have a very good ministry but that we are a very bad people"  that we set ourselves to bite the hand that feeds us that with a malignant insanity we oppose the measures and ungratefully vilify the persons of those whose sole object is our own peace and prosperity If a few puny libellers acting under a knot of factious politicians without virtue parts or character such they are constantly represented by these gentlemen are sufficient to excite this disturbance very perverse must be the disposition of that people amongst whom such a disturbance can be excited by such means It is besides no small aggravation of the public misfortune that the disease on this hypothesis appears to be without remedy If the wealth of the nation be the cause of its turbulence I imagine it is not proposed to introduce poverty as a constable to keep the peace If our dominions abroad are the roots which feed all this rank luxuriance of sedition it is not intended to cut them off in order to famish the fruit If our liberty has enfeebled the executive power there is no design I hope to call in the aid of despotism to fill up the deficiencies of law Whatever may be intended these things are not yet professed We seem therefore to be driven to absolute despair for we have no other materials to work upon but those out of which God has been pleased to form the inhabitants of this island If these be radically and essentially vitious all that can be said is that those men are very unhappy to whose fortune or duty it falls to administer the affairs  of this untoward people I hear it indeed sometimes asserted that a steady perseverance in the present measures and a rigorous punishment of those who oppose them will in course of time infallibly put an end to these disorders But this in my opinion is said without much observation of our present disposition and without any knowledge at all of the general nature of mankind If the matter of which this nation is composed be so very fermentable as these gentlemen describe it leaven never will be wanting to work it up as long as discontent revenge and ambition have existed in the world Particular punishments are the cure for accidental distempers in the state they inflame rather than allay those heats which arise from the settled mismanagement of the government or from a natural ill disposition in the people It is of the utmost moment not to make mistakes in the use of strong measures and firmness is then only a virtue when it accompanies the most perfect wisdom In truth inconstancy is a sort of natural corrective of folly and ignorance  I AM not one of those who think that the people are never in the wrong They have been so frequently and outrageously both in other countries and in this But I do say that in all disputes between them and their rulers the presumption is at least upon a par in favour of the people Experience may perhaps justify me in going further Where popular discontents have been very prevalent it may well be affirmed and supported that there has been generally something found amiss in the constitution or in the conduct of government The people have no interest in disorder When they do wrong it is their error and not their crime But with the governing part of the state it is far otherwise They certainly may act ill by  design as well as by mistake  "  Les revolutions qui arrivent dans les grands etats ne sont point un effect du hazard ni du caprice des peuples Rein ne revolte  les grands  d'un royaume comme  un Gouvernement foible et derange  Pour la  populace  ce n'est jamais par envie d'attaquer qu'elle se souleve mais par impatience de souffrir  Mem de Sully vol I p  "  These are the words of a great man of a minister of state and zealous assertor of monarchy They are applied to the  system of Favouritism  which was adopted by Henry the third of France and to the dreadful consequences it produced What he says of revolutions is equally true of all great disturbances If this presumption in favour of the subjects against the trustees of power be not the more probable I am sure it is the more comfortable speculation because it is more easy to change an administration than to reform a people  UPON a supposition therefore that in the opening of the cause the presumptions stand equally balanced between the parties there seems sufficient ground to entitle any person to a fair hearing who attempts some other scheme beside that easy one which is fashionable in some fashionable companies to account for the present discontents It is not to be argued that we endure no grievance because our grievances are not of the same sort with those under which we laboured formerly not precisely those which we bore from the Tudors or vindicated on the Stuarts A great change has taken place in the affairs of this country For in the silent lapse of events as material alterations have been insensibly brought about in the policy and character of governments and nations as those which have been marked by the tumult of public revolutions  IT is very rare indeed for men to be wrong in their feelings concerning public misconduct as rare to be right in their speculation upon the cause of it I have constantly observed that the generality of people are fifty years at least behindhand in their politics There are but very few who are capable of comparing and digesting what passes before their eyes at different times and occasions so as to form the whole into a distinct system But in books every thing is settled for them without the exertion of any considerable diligence or sagacity For which reason men are wise with but little reflection and good with little selfdenial in the business of all times except their own We are very uncorrupt and tolerably enlightened judges of the transactions of past ages where no passions deceive and where the whole train of circumstances from the trifling cause to the tragical event is set in an orderly series before us Few are the partizans of departed tyranny and to be a whig on the business of an hundred years ago is very consistent with every advantage of present servility This retrospective wisdom and historical patriotism are things of wonderful convenience and serve admirably to reconcile the old quarrel between speculation and practice Many a stern republican after gorging himself with a full feast of admiration of the Grecian commonwealths and of our true Saxon constitution and discharging all the splendid bile of his virtuous indignation on king John and king James sits down perfectly satisfied to the coarsest work and homeliest job of the day he lives in I believe there was no professed admirer of Henry the eighth among the instruments of the last king James nor in the court of Henry the eighth was there I dare say to be found a single advocate for the favourites of Richard the second  NO complaisance to our court or to our age can make me believe nature to be so changed but  that public liberty will be among us as among our ancestors obnoxious to some person or other and that opportunities will be furnished for attempting at least some alteration to the prejudice of our constitution These attempts will naturally vary in their mode according to times and circumstances For ambition though it has ever the same general views has not at all times the same means nor the same particular objects A great deal of the furniture of ancient tyranny is worn to rags the rest is entirely out of fashion Besides there are few statesmen so very clumsy and aukward in their business as to fall into the identical snare which has proved fatal to their predecessors When an arbitrary imposition is attempted upon the subject undoubtedly it will not bear on its forehead the name of  Shipmoney  There is no danger that an extension of the  Forest laws  should be the chosen mode of oppression in this age And when we hear any instance of ministerial rapacity to the prejudice of the rights of private life it will certainly not be the exaction of two hundred pullets from a woman of fashion for leave to lie with her own husband  "Uxor Hugonis de Nevill dat Domino Regi ducentas Gallinas eo quod possit jacere una nocte cum Domino suo Hugone de Nevill"  Maddox Hist Exch c xiii p    EVERY age has its own manners and its politics dependent upon them and the same attempts will not be made against a constitution fully formed and matured that were used to destroy it in the cradle or to resist its growth during its infancy  AGAINST the being of parliament I am satisfied no designs have ever been entertained since the revolution Every one must perceive that it is strongly the interest of the court to have some second cause interposed between the ministers and  the people The gentlemen of the House of Commons have an interest equally strong in sustaining the part of that intermediate cause However they may hire out the  usufruct  of their voices they never will part with the  fee and inheritance  Accordingly those who have been of the most known devotion to the will and pleasure of a court have at the same time been most forward in asserting an high authority in the House of Commons When they knew who were to use that authority and how it was to be employed they thought it never could be carried too far It must be always the wish of an unconstitutional statesman that an House of Commons who are entirely dependent upon him should have every right of the people entirely dependant upon their pleasure It was soon discovered that the forms of a free and the ends of an arbitrary government were things not altogether incompatible  THE power of the crown almost dead and rotten as prerogative has grown up anew with much more strength and far less odium under the name of influence An influence which operated without noise and without violence an influence which converted the very antagonist into the instrument of power which contained in itself a perpetual principle of growth and renovation and which the distresses and the prosperity of the country equally tended to augment was an admirable substitute for a prerogative that being only the offspring of antiquated prejudices had moulded in its original stamina irresistible principles of decay and dissolution The ignorance of the people is a bottom but for a temporary system the interest of active men in the state is a foundation perpetual and infallible However some circumstances arising it must be confessed in a great degree from accident prevented the effects of this influence for a long time from  breaking out in a manner capable of exciting any serious apprehensions Although government was strong and flourished exceedingly the  Court  had drawn far less advantage than one would imagine from this great source of power  AT the revolution the crown deprived for the ends of the revolution itself of many prerogatives was found too weak to struggle against all the difficulties which pressed so new and unsettled a government The court was obliged therefore to delegate a part of its powers to men of such interest as could support and of such fidelity as would adhere to its establishment Such men were able to draw in a greater number to a concurrence in the common defence This connexion necessary at first continued long after convenient and properly conducted might indeed in all situations be an useful instrument of government At the same time through the intervention of men of popular weight and character the people possessed a security for their just portion of importance in the state But as the title to the crown grew stronger by long possession and by the constant increase of its influence these helps have of late seemed to certain persons no better than incumbrances The powerful managers for government were not sufficiently submissive to the pleasure of the possessors of immediate and personal favour sometimes from a confidence in their own strength natural and acquired sometimes from a fear of offending their friends and weakening that lead in the country which gave them a consideration independent of the court Men acted as if the court could receive as well as confer an obligation The influence of government thus divided in appearance between the court and the leaders of parties became in many cases an accession rather to the popular than to the royal  scale and some part of that influence which would otherwise have been possessed as in a sort of mortmain and unalienable domain returned again to the great ocean from whence it arose and circulated among the people This method therefore of governing by men of great natural interest or great acquired consideration was viewed in a very invidious light by the true lovers of absolute monarchy It is the nature of despotism to abhor power held by any means but its own momentary pleasure and to annihilate all intermediate situations between boundless strength on its own part and total debility on the part of the people  TO get rid of all this intermediate and independent importance and  to secure to the court the unlimited and uncontrouled use of its own vast influence under the sole direction of its own private favour  has for some years past been the great object of policy If this were compassed the influence of the crown must of course produce all the effects which the most sanguine partizans of the court could possibly desire Government might then be carried on without any concurrence on the part of the people without any attention to the dignity of the greater or to the affections of the lower sorts A new project was therefore devised by a certain set of intriguing men totally different from the system of administration which had prevailed since the accession of the house of Brunswick This project I have heard was first conceived by some persons in the court of Frederick prince of Wales  THE earliest attempt in the execution of this design was to set up for minister a person in rank indeed respectable and very ample in fortune but who to the moment of this vast and sudden elevation was little known or considered in the  kingdom To him the whole nation was to yield an immediate and implicit submission But whether it was for want of firmness to bear up against the first opposition or that things were not yet fully ripened or that this method was not found the most eligible that idea was soon abandoned The instrumental part of the project was a little altered to accommodate it to the time and to bring things more gradually and more surely to the one great end proposed  THE first part of the reformed plan was to draw  a line which should separate the court from the ministry  Hitherto these names had been looked upon as synonymous but for the future court and administration were to be considered as things totally distinct By this operation two systems of administration were to be formed one which should be in the real secret and confidence the other merely ostensible to perform the official and executory duties of government The latter were alone to be responsible whilst the real advisers who enjoyed all the power were effectually removed from all the danger  SECONDLY  A party under these leaders was to be formed in favour of the court against the ministry  this party was to have a large share in the emoluments of government and to hold it totally separate from and independent of ostensible administration  THE third point and that on which the success of the whole scheme ultimately depended was  to bring parliament to an acquiescence in this project  Parliament was therefore to be taught by degrees a total indifference to the persons rank influence abilities connexions and character of the ministers of the crown By means of a discipline  on which I shall say more hereafter that body was to be habituated to the most opposite interests and the most discordant politics All connexions and dependencies among subjects were to be entirely dissolved As hitherto business had gone through the hands of leaders of whigs or tories men of talents to conciliate the people and engage to their confidence now the method was to be altered and the lead was to be given to men of no sort of consideration or credit in the country This want of natural importance was to be their very title to delegated power Members of parliament were to be hardened into an insensibility to pride as well as to duty Those high and haughty sentiments which are the great support of independence were to be let down gradually Point of honour and precedence were no more to be regarded in parliamentary decorum than in a Turkish army It was to be avowed as a constitutional maxim that the king might appoint one of his footmen or one of your footmen for minister and that he ought to be and that he would be as well followed as the first name for rank and wisdom in the nation Thus parliament was to look on as if perfectly unconcerned while a cabal of the closet and backstairs was substituted in the place of a national administration  WITH such a degree of acquiescence any measure of any court might well be deemed thoroughly secure The capital objects and by much the most flattering characteristics of arbitrary power would be obtained Every thing would be drawn from its holdings in the country to the personal favour and inclination of the prince This favour would be the sole introduction to power and the only tenure by which it was to be held so that no person looking towards another and all looking  towards the court it was impossible but that the motive which solely influenced every man's hopes must come in time to govern every man's conduct till at last the servility became universal in spite of the dead letter of any laws or institutions whatsoever  HOW it should happen that any man could be tempted to venture upon such a project of government may at first view appear surprizing But the fact is that opportunities very inviting to such an attempt have offered and the scheme itself was not destitute of some arguments not wholly unplausible to recommend it These opportunities and these arguments the use that has been made of both the plan for carrying this new scheme of government into execution and the effects which it has produced are in my opinion worthy of our serious consideration  HIS majesty came to the throne of these kingdoms with more advantages than any of his predecessors since the Revolution Fourth in descent and third in succession of his royal family even the zealots of hereditary right in him saw something to flatter their favourite prejudices and to justify a transfer of their attachments without a change in their principles The person and cause of the Pretender were become contemptible his title disowned throughout Europe his party disbanded in England His majesty came indeed to the inheritance of a mighty war but victorious in every part of the globe peace was always in his power not to negociate but to dictate No foreign habitudes or attachments withdrew him from the cultivation of his power at home His revenue for the civil establishment fixed as it was then thought at a large but definite sum was ample without being invidious His influence by additions from  conquest by an augmentation of debt by an increase of military and naval establishment much strengthened and extended And coming to the throne in the prime and full vigour of youth as from affection there was a strong dislike so from dread there seemed to be a general averseness from giving any thing like offence to a monarch against whose resentment opposition could not look for a refuge in any sort of reversionary hope  THESE singular advantages inspired his majesty only with a more ardent desire to preserve unimpaired the spirit of that national freedom to which he owed a situation so full of glory But to others it suggested sentiments of a very different nature They thought they now beheld an opportunity by a certain sort of statesmen never long undiscovered or unemployed of drawing to themselves by the aggrandisement of a court faction a degree of power which they could never hope to derive from natural influence or from honourable service and which it was impossible they could hold with the least security whilst the system of administration rested upon its former bottom In order to facilitate the execution of their design it was necessary to make many alterations in political arrangement and a single change in the opinions habits and connexions of the greatest part of those who at that time acted in public  IN the first place they proceeded gradually but not slowly to destroy every thing of strength which did not derive its principal nourishment from the immediate pleasure of the court The greatest weight of popular opinion and party connexion were then with the duke of Newcastle and Mr Pitt Neither of these held their importance by the  new tenure  of the court they were not therefore thought to be so proper as others for the services  which were required by that tenure It happened very favourably for the new system that under a forced coalition there rankled an incurable alienation and disgust between the parties which composed the administration Mr Pitt was first attacked Not satisfied with removing him from power they endeavoured by various artifices to ruin his character The other party seemed rather pleased to get rid of so oppressive a support not perceiving that their own fall was prepared by his and involved in it Many other reasons prevented them from daring to look their true situation in the face To the great Whig families it was extremely disagreeable and seemed almost unnatural to oppose the administration of a prince of the house of Brunswic Day after day they hesitated and doubted and lingered expecting that other counsels would take place and were slow to be persuaded that all which had been done by the cabal was the effect not of humour but of system It was more strongly and evidently the interest of the new court faction to get rid of the great Whig connexions than to destroy Mr Pitt The power of that gentleman was vast indeed and merited but it was in a great degree personal and therefore transient Theirs was rooted in the country For with a good deal less of popularity they possessed a far more natural and fixed influence Long possession of government vast property obligations of favours given and received connexion of offices ties of blood of alliance of friendship things at that time supposed of some force the name of Whig dear to the majority of the people the zeal early begun and steadily continued to the royal family all these together formed a body of power in the nation which was criminal and devoted The great ruling principle of the cabal and that which animated and harmonized all their proceedings how various soever they may have  been was to signify to the world that the court would proceed upon its own proper forces only and that the pretence of bringing any other into its service was an affront to it and not a support Therefore when the chiefs were removed in order to go to the root the whole party was put under a proscription so general and severe as to take their hardearned bread from the lowest officers in a manner which had never been known before even in general revolutions But it was thought necessary effectually to destroy all dependencies but one and to shew an example of the firmness and rigour with which the new system was to be supported  THUS for the time were pulled down in the persons of the Whig leaders and of Mr Pitt in spite of the services of the one at the accession of the royal family and the recent services of the other in the war the  two only securities for the importance of the people power arising from popularity and power arising from connexion  Here and there indeed a few individuals were left standing who gave security for their total estrangement from the odious principles of party connexion and personal attachment and it must be confessed that most of them have religiously kept their faith Such a change could not however be made without a mighty shock to government  TO reconcile the minds of the people to all these movements principles correspondent to them had been preached up with great zeal Every one must remember that the cabal set out with the most astonishing prudery both moral and political Those who in a few months after soused over head and ears into the deepest and dirtiest pits of corruption cried out violently against the indirect practices in the electing and managing of parliaments which had formerly prevailed This marvellous abhorrence  which the court had suddenly taken to all influence was not only circulated in conversation through the kingdom but pompously announced to the public with many other extraordinary things in a pamphlet  Sentiments of an honest Man  which had all the appearance of a manifesto preparatory to some considerable enterprize Throughout it was a satire though in terms managed and decent enough on the politics of the former reign It was indeed written with no small art and address  IN this piece appeared the first dawning of the new system there first appeared the idea then only in speculation of  separating the court from the administration  of carrying every thing from national connexion to personal regards and of forming a regular party for that purpose under the name of  king's men    TO recommend this system to the people a perspective view of the court gorgeously painted and finally illuminated from within was exhibited to the gaping multitude Party was to be totally done away with all its evil works Corruption was to be cast down from court as  Atè  was from Heaven Power was thenceforward to be the chosen residence of public spirit and no one was to be supposed under any sinister influence except those who had the misfortune to be in disgrace at court which was to stand in lieu of all vices and all corruptions A scheme of perfection to be realized in a monarchy far beyond the visionary republic of Plato The whole scenery was exactly disposed to captivate those good souls whose credulous morality is so in valuable a treasure to crafty politicians Indeed there was wherewithal to charm every body except those few who are not much pleased with professions  of supernatural virtue who know of what stuff such professions are made for what purposes they are designed and in what they are sure constantly to end Many innocent gentlemen who had been talking prose all their lives without knowing any thing of the matter began at last to open their eyes upon their own merits and to attribute their not having been lords of the Treasury and lords of Trade many years before merely to the prevalence of party and to the ministerial power which had frustrated the good intentions of the court in favour of their abilities Now was the time to unlock the sealed fountain of royal bounty which had been infamously monopolized and huckstered and to let it flow at large upon the whole people The time was come to restore royalty to its original splendour  Mettre le roy hors de page  became a sort of watchword And it was constantly in the mouths of all the runners of the court that nothing could preserve the balance of the constitution from being overturned by the rabble or by a faction of the nobility but to free the sovereign effectually from that ministerial tyranny under which the royal dignity had been oppressed in the person of his majesty's grandfather  THESE were some of the many artifices used to reconcile the people to the great change which was made in the persons who composed the ministry and the still greater which was made and avowed in its constitution As to individuals other methods were employed with them in order so thoroughly to disunite every party and even every family that  no concert order or effect might appear in any future opposition  And in this manner an administration without connexion with the people or with one another was first put in possession of government What good consequences followed  from it we have all seen whether with regard to virtue public or private to the ease and happiness of the sovereign or to the real strength of government But as so much stress was then laid on the necessity of this new project it will not be amiss to take a view of the effects of this royal servitude and vile durance which was so deplored in the reign of the late monarch and was so carefully to be avoided in the reign of his successor The effects were these  IN times full of doubt and danger to his person and family George the second maintained the dignity of his crown connected with the liberty of his people not only unimpaired but improved for the space of thirtythree years He overcame a dangerous rebellion abetted by foreign force and raging in the heart of his kingdoms and thereby destroyed the seeds of all future rebellion that could arise upon the same principle He carried the glory the power the commerce of England to an height unknown even to this renowned nation in the times of its greatest prosperity and he left his succession resting on the true and only true foundations of all national and all regal greatness affection at home reputation abroad trust in allies terror in rival nations The most ardent lover of his country cannot wish for Great Britain an happier fate than to continue as she was then left A people emulous as we are in affection to our present sovereign know not how to form a prayer to Heaven for a greater blessing upon his virtues or an higher state of felicity and glory than that he should live and should reign and when Providence ordains it should die exactly like his illustrious predecessor  A GREAT prince may be obliged though such a thing cannot happen very often to sacrifice his private  inclination to his public interest A wise prince will not think that such a restraint implies a condition of servility and truly if such was the condition of the last reign and the effects were also such as we have described we ought no less for the sake of the sovereign whom we love than for our own to hear arguments convincing indeed before we depart from the maxims of that reign or fly in the face of this great body of strong and recent experience  ONE of the principal topics which was then and has been since much employed by that political  See the Political Writings of the late Dr Brown and many others  school is an affected terror of the growth of an aristocratic power prejudicial to the rights of the crown and the balance of the constitution Any new powers exercised in the house of lords or in the house of commons or by the crown ought certainly to excite the vigilant and anxious jealousy of a free people Even a new and unprecedented course of action in the whole legislature without great and evident reason may be a subject of just uneasiness I will not affirm that there may not have lately appeared in the house of lords a disposition to some attempts derogatory to the legal rights of the subject If any such have really appeared they have arisen not from a power properly aristocratic but from the same influence which is charged with having excited attempts of a similar nature in the house of commons which house if it should have been betrayed into an unfortunate quarrel with its constituents and involved in a charge of the very same nature could have neither power nor inclination to repel such attempts in others Those attempts in the house of lords can no more be called aristocratic proceedings  than the proceedings with regard to the county of Middlesex in the house of commons can with any sense be called democratical  IT is true that the peers have a great influence in the kingdom and in every part of the public concerns While they are men of property it is impossible to prevent it except by such means as must prevent all property from its natural operation an event not easily to be compassed while property is power nor by any means to be wished while the least notion exists of the method by which the spirit of liberty acts and of the means by which it is preserved If any particular peers by their uniform upright constitutional conduct by their public and their private virtues have acquired an influence in the country the people on whose favour that influence depends and from whom it arose will never be duped into an opinion that such greatness in a peer is the despotism of an aristocracy when they know and feel it to be the effect and pledge of their own importance  I AM no friend to aristocracy in the sense at least in which that word is usually understood If it were not a bad habit to moot cases on the supposed ruin of the constitution I should be free to declare that if it must perish I would rather by far see it resolved into any other form than lost in that austere and insolent domination But whatever my dislikes may be my fears are not upon that quarter The question on the influence of a court and of a peerage is not which of the two dangers is the most eligible but which is the most imminent He is but a poor observer who has not seen that the generality of peers far from supporting themselves in a state of independent greatness are but too apt to fall into an oblivion of their proper dignity and to run headlong into  an abject servitude Would to God it were true that the fault of our peers were too much spirit It is worthy of some observation that these gentlemen so jealous of aristocracy make no complaints of the power of those peers neither few nor inconsiderable who are always in the train of a court and whose whole weight must be considered as a portion of the settled influence of the crown This is all safe and right but if some peers I am very sorry they are not as many as they ought to be set themselves in the great concern of peers and commons against a backstairs influence and clandestine government then the alarm begins then the constitution is in danger of being forced into an aristocracy  I REST a little the longer on this court topic because it was much insisted upon at the time of the great change and has been since frequently revived by many of the agents of that party for whilst they are terrifying the great and opulent with the horrors of mobgovernment they are by other managers attempting though hitherto with little success to alarm the people with a phantom of tyranny in the nobles All this is done upon their favourite principle of disunion of sowing jealousies amongst the different orders of the state and of disjointing the natural strength of the kingdom that it may be rendered incapable of resisting the sinister designs of wicked men who have engrossed the royal power  THUS much of the topics chosen by the courtiers to recommend their system it will be necessary to open a little more at large the nature of that party which was formed for its support Without this the whole would have been no better than a visionary amusement like the scheme of Harrington's political club and not a business  in which the nation had a real concern As a powerful party and a party constructed on a new principle it is a very inviting object of curiosity  IT must be remembered that since the revolution until the period we are speaking of the influence of the crown had been always employed in supporting the ministers of state and in carrying on the public business according to their opinions But the party now in question is formed upon a very different idea It is to intercept the favour protection and confidence of the crown in the passage to its ministers it is to come between them and their importance in parliament it is to separate them from all their natural and acquired dependencies it is intended as the controul not the support of administration The machinery of this system is perplexed in its movements and false in its principle It is formed on a supposition that the king is something external to his government and that he may be honoured and aggrandized even by its debility and disgrace The plan proceeds expressly on the idea of enfeebling the regular executory power It proceeds on the idea of weakening the state in order to strengthen the court The scheme depending entirely on distrust on disconnexion on mutability by principle on systematic weakness in every particular member it is impossible that the total result should be substantial strength of any kind  AS a foundation of their scheme the cabal have established a sort of  rota  in the court All sorts of parties by this means have been brought into administration from whence few have had the good fortune to escape without disgrace none at all without considerable losses In the beginning of each arrangement no professions of confidence and support are wanting to induce the leading  men to engage But while the ministers of the day appear in all the pomp and pride of power while they have all their canvas spread out to the wind and every sail filled with the fair and prosperous gale of royal favour in a short time they find they know not how a current which sets directly against them which prevents all progress and even drives them backwards They grow ashamed and mortified in a situation which by its vicinity to power only serves to remind them the more strongly of their insignificance They are obliged either to execute the orders of their inferiors or to see themselves opposed by the natural instruments of their office With the loss of their dignity they lose their temper In their turn they grow troublesome to that cabal which whether it supports or opposes equally disgraces and equally betrays them It is soon found necessary to get rid of the heads of administration but it is of the heads only As there always are many rotten members belonging to the best connexions it is not hard to persuade several to continue in office without their leaders By this means the party goes out much thinner than it came in and is only reduced in strength by its temporary possession of power Besides if by accident or in course of changes that power should be recovered the junto have thrown up a retrenchment of these carcases which may serve to cover themselves in a day of danger They conclude not unwisely that such rotten members will become the first objects of disgust and resentment to their antient connexions  THEY contrive to form in the outward administration two parties at the least which whilst they are tearing one another to pieces are both competitors for the favour and protection of the  cabal and by their emulation contribute to throw every thing more and more into the hands of the interior managers  A MINISTER of state will sometimes keep himself totally estranged from all his colleagues will differ from them in their councils will privately traverse and publicly oppose their measures He will however continue in his employment Instead of suffering any mark of displeasure he will be distinguished by an unbounded profusion of court rewards and caresses because he does what is expected and all that is expected from men in office He helps to keep some form of administration in being and keeps it at the same time as weak and divided as possible  HOWEVER we must take care not to be mistaken or to imagine that such persons have any weight in their opposition When by them administration is convinced of its insignificancy they are soon to be convinced of their own They never are suffered to succeed in their opposition They and the world are to be satisfied that neither office nor authority nor property nor ability eloquence council skill or union are of the least importance but that the mere influence of the court naked of all support and destitute of all management is abundantly sufficient for all its own purposes  WHEN any adverse connexion is to be destroyed the cabal seldom appear in the work themselves They find out some person of whom the party entertains an high opinion Such a person they endeavour to delude with various pretences They teach him first to distrust and then to quarrel with his friends among whom by the same arts they excite a similar diffidence of him so that in this  mutual fear and distrust he may suffer himself to be employed as the instrument in the change which is brought about Afterwards they are sure to destroy him in his turn by setting up in his place some person in whom he had himself reposed the greatest confidence and who serves to carry off a considerable part of his adherents  WHEN such a person has broke in this manner with his connexions he is soon compelled to commit some flagrant act of iniquitous personal hostility against some of them such as an attempt to strip a particular friend of his family estate by which the cabal hope to render the parties utterly irreconcilable In truth they have so contrived matters that people have a greater hatred to the subordinate instruments than to the principal movers  AS in destroying their enemies they make use of instruments not immediately belonging to their corps so in advancing their own friends they pursue exactly the same method To promote any of them to considerable rank or emolument they commonly take care that the recommendation shall pass through the hands of the ostensible ministry such a recommendation might however appear to the world as some proof of the credit of ministers and some means of increasing their strength To prevent this the persons so advanced are directed in all companies industriously to declare that they are under no obligations whatsoever to administration that they have received their office from another quarter that they are totally free and independent  WHEN the faction has any job of lucre to obtain or of vengeance to perpetrate their way is to select for the execution those very persons to whose habits friendships principles and declarations such  proceedings are publicly known to be the most adverse at once to render the instruments the more odious and therefore the more dependent and to prevent the people from ever reposing a confidence in any appearance of private friendship or public principle  IF the administration seem now and then from remissness or from fear of making themselves disagreeable to suffer any popular excesses to go unpunished the cabal immediately sets up some creature of theirs to raise a clamour against the ministers as having shamefully betrayed the dignity of government Then they compel the ministry to become active in conferring rewards and honours on the persons who have been the instruments of their disgrace and after having first vilified them with the higher orders for suffering the laws to sleep over the licentiousness of the populace they drive them in order to make amends for their former inactivity to some act of atrocious violence which renders them completely abhorred by the people They who remember the riots which attended the Middlesex election the opening of the present parliament and the transaction relative to Saint George's Fields will not be at a loss for an application of these remarks  THAT this body may be enabled to compass all the ends of its institution its members are scarcely ever to aim at the high and responsible offices of the state They are distributed with art and judgment through all the secondary but efficient departments of office and through the households of all the branches of the royal family so as on one hand to occupy all the avenues to the throne and on the other to forward or frustrate the execution of any measure according to their own interests For with the credit and support which they are known to  have though for the greater part in places which are only a genteel excuse for salary they possess all the influence of the highest posts and they dictate publicly in almost every thing even with a parade of superiority Whenever they dissent as it often happens from their nominal leaders the trained part of the senate instinctively in the secret is sure to follow them provided the leaders sensible of their situation do not of themselves recede in time from their most declared opinions This latter is generally the case It will not be conceivable to any one who has not seen it what pleasure is taken by the cabal in rendering these heads of office thoroughly contemptible and ridiculous And when they are become so they have then the best chance for being well supported  THE members of the court faction are fully indemnified for not holding places on the slippery heights of the kingdom not only by the lead in all affairs but also by the perfect security in which they enjoy less conspicuous but very advantageous situations Their places are in express legal tenure or in effect all of them for life Whilst the first and most respectable persons in the kingdom are tossed about like tennis balls the sport of a blind and insolent caprice no minister dares even to cast an oblique glance at the lowest of their body If an attempt be made upon one of this corps immediately he flies to sanctuary and pretends to the most inviolable of all promises No conveniency of public arrangement is available to remove any one of them from the specific situation he holds and the slightest attempt upon one of them by the most powerful minister is a certain preliminary to his own destruction  CONSCIOUS of their independence they bear themselves with a lofty air to the exterior ministers  Like Janissaries they derive a kind of freedom from the very condition of their servitude They may act just as they please provided they are true to the great ruling principle of their institution It is therefore not at all wonderful that people should be so desirous of adding themselves to that body in which they may possess and reconcile satisfactions the most alluring and seemingly the most contradictory enjoying at once all the spirited pleasure of independence and all the gross lucre and fat emoluments of servitude  HERE is a sketch though a slight one of the constitution laws and policy of this new court corporation The name by which they chuse to distinguish themselves is that of  King's men  or the  King's friends  by an invidious exclusion of the rest of his majesty's most loyal and affectionate subjects The whole system comprehending the exterior and interior administrations is commonly called in the technical language of the court  Double Cabinet  in French or English as you choose to pronounce it  WHETHER all this be a vision of a distracted brain or the invention of a malicious heart or a real faction in the country must be judged by the appearances which things have worn for eight years past Thus far I am certain that there is not a single public man in or out of office who has not at some time or other born testimony to the truth of what I have now related In particular no persons have been more strong in their assertions and louder and more indecent in their complaints than those who compose all the exterior part of the present administration in whose time that faction has arrived at such an height of power and of boldness in the use of it as may in the end perhaps bring about its total destruction  IT is true that about four years ago during the administration of the marquis of Rockingham an attempt was made to carry on government without their concurrence However this was only a transient cloud they were hid but for a moment and their constellation blazed out with greater brightness and a far more vigorous influence some time after it was blown over An attempt was at that time made but without any idea of proscription to break their corps to discountenance their doctrines to revive connexions of a different kind to restore the principles and policy of the whigs to reanimate the cause of liberty by ministerial countenance and then for the first time were men seen attached in office to every principle they had maintained in opposition No one will doubt that such men were abhorred and violently opposed by the court faction and that such a system could have but a short duration  IT may appear somewhat affected that in so much discourse upon this extraordinary party I should say so little of the earl of Bute who is the supposed head of it But this was neither owing to affectation nor inadvertence I have carefully avoided the introduction of personal reflections of any kind Much the greater part of the topics which have been used to blacken this nobleman are either unjust or frivolous At best they have a tendency to give the resentment of this bitter calamity a wrong direction and to turn a public grievance into a mean personal or a dangerous national quarrel Where there is a regular scheme of operations carried on it is the system and not any individual person who acts in it that is truly dangerous This system has not risen solely from the ambition of lord Bute but from the circumstances which favoured it and from an indifference  to the constitution which had been for some time growing among our gentry We should have been tried with it if the earl of Bute had never existed and it will want neither a contriving head nor active members when the earl of Bute exists no longer It is not therefore to rail at lord Bute but firmly to embody against this court party and its practices which can afford us any prospect of relief in our present condition  ANOTHER motive induces me to put the personal consideration of lord Bute wholly out of the question He communicates very little in a direct manner with the greater part of our men of business This has never been his custom It is enough for him that he surrounds them with his creatures Several imagine therefore that they have a very good excuse for doing all the work of this faction when they have no personal connexion with lord Bute But whoever becomes a party to an administration composed of insulated individuals without faith plighted tie or common principle an administration constitutionally impotent because supported by no party in the nation he who contributes to destroy the connexions of men and their trust in one another or in any sort to throw the dependence of public counsels upon private will and favour possibly may have nothing to do with the earl of Bute It matters little whether he be the friend or the enemy of that particular person But let him be who or what he will he abets a faction that is driving hard to the ruin of his country He is sapping the foundation of its liberty disturbing the sources of its domestic tranquillity weakening its government over its dependencies degrading it from all its importance in the system of Europe  IT is this unnatural infusion of a  system of favouritism  into a government which in a great part of its constitution is popular that has raised the present ferment in the nation The people without entering deeply into its principles could plainly perceive its effects in much violence in a great spirit of innovation and a general disorder in all the functions of government I keep my eye solely on this system if I speak of those measures which have arisen from it it will be so far only as they illustrate the general scheme This is the fountain of all those bitter waters of which through an hundred different conduits we have drunk until we are ready to burst The discretionary power of the crown in the formation of ministry abused by bad or weak men has given rise to a system which without directly violating the letter of any law operates against the spirit of the whole constitution  A PLAN of favouritism for our executory government is essentially at variance with the plan of our legislature One great end undoubtedly of a mixed government like ours composed of monarchy and of controuls on the part of the higher people and the lower is that the prince shall not be able to violate the laws This is useful indeed and fundamental But this even at first view is no more than a negative advantage an armour merely defensive It is therefore next in order and equal in importance  that the discretionary powers which are necessarily vested in the monarch whether for the execution of the laws or for the nomination to magistracy and office or for conducting the affairs of peace and war or for ordering the revenue should all be exercised upon public principles and national grounds and not on the likings or prejudices the intrigues or policies of a court  This I said is  equal in importance to the securing a government according to law The laws reach but a very little way Constitute government how you please infinitely the greater part of it must depend upon the exercise of the powers which are left at large to the prudence and uprightness of ministers of state Even all the use and potency of the laws depends upon them Without them your commonwealth is no better than a scheme upon paper and not a living acting effective constitution It is possible that through negligence or ignorance or design artfully conducted ministers may suffer one part of government to languish another to be perverted from its purposes and every valuable interest of the country to fall into ruin and decay without possibility of fixing any single act on which a criminal prosecution can be justly grounded The due arrangement of men in the active part of the state far from being foreign to the purposes of a wise government ought to be among its very first and dearest objects When therefore the abettors of the new system tell us that between them and their opposers there is nothing but a struggle for power and that therefore we are noways concerned in it we must tell those who have the impudence to insult us in this manner that of all things we ought to be the most concerned who and what sort of men they are that hold the trust of every thing that is dear to us Nothing can render this a point of indifference to the nation but what must either render us totally desperate or soothe us into the security of idiots We must soften into a credulity below the milkiness of infancy to think all men virtuous We must be tainted with a malignity truly diabolical to believe all the world to be equally wicked and corrupt Men are in public life as in private some good some evil The elevation of the one and  the depression of the other are the first objects of all true policy But that form of government which neither in its direct institutions nor in their immediate tendency has contrived to throw its affairs into the most trustworthy hands but has left its whole executory system to be disposed of agreeably to the uncontrouled pleasure of any one man however excellent or virtuous is a plan of polity defective not only in that member but consequentially erroneous in every part of it  IN arbitrary governments the constitution of the ministry follows the constitution of the legislature Both the law and the magistrate are the creatures of will It must be so Nothing indeed will appear more certain on any tolerable consideration of this matter than that  every sort of government ought to have its administration correspondent to its legislature  If it should be otherwise things must fall into an hideous disorder The people of a free commonwealth who have taken such care that their laws should be the result of general consent cannot be so senseless as to suffer their executory system to be composed of persons on whom they have no dependence and whom no proofs of the public love and confidence have recommended to those powers upon the use of which the very being of the state depends  THE popular election of magistrates and popular disposition of rewards and honours is one of the first advantages of a free state Without it or something equivalent to it perhaps the people cannot long enjoy the substance of freedom certainly none of the vivifying energy of good government The frame of our commonwealth did not admit of such an actual election but it provided as well and while the spirit of the constitution is preserved better for all the effects of it than  by the method of suffrage in any democratic state whatsoever It had always until of late been held the first duty of parliament  to refuse to support government until power was in the hands of persons who were acceptable to the people or while factions predominated in the court in which the nation had no confidence  Thus all the good effects of popular election were supposed to be secured to us without the mischiefs attending on perpetual intrigue and a distinct canvass for every particular office throughout the body of the people This was the most noble and refined part of our constitution The people by their representatives and grandees were intrusted with a deliberative power in making laws the king with the controul of his negative The king was intrusted with the deliberative choice and the election to office the people had the negative in a parliamentary refusal to support Formerly this power of controul was what kept ministers in awe of parliaments and parliaments in reverence with the people If the use of this power of controul on the system and persons of administration is gone every thing is lost parliament and all We may assure ourselves that if parliament will tamely see evil men take possession of all the strongholds of their country and allow them time and means to fortify themselves under a pretence of giving them a fair trial and upon a hope of discovering whether they will not be reformed by power and whether their measures will not be better than their morals such a parliament will give countenance to their measures also whatever that parliament may pretend and whatever those measures may be  EVERY good political institution must have a preventive operation as well as a remedial It ought to have a natural tendency to exclude bad men  from government and not to trust for the safety of the state to subsequent punishment alone punishment which has ever been tardy and uncertain and which when power is suffered in bad hands may chance to fall rather on the injured than the criminal  BEFORE men are put forward into the great trusts of the state they ought by their conduct to have obtained such a degree of estimation in their country as may be some sort of pledge and securito the public that they will not abuse those trusts It is no mean security for a proper use of power that a man has shewn by the general tenor of his actions that the affection the good opinion the confidence of his fellow citizens have been among the principal objects of his life and that he has owed none of the gradations of his power or fortune to a settled contempt or occasional forfeiture of their esteem  THAT man who before he comes into power has no friends or who coming into power is obliged to desert his friends or who losing it has no friends to to sympathize with him he who has no sway among any part of the landed or commercial interest but whose whole importance has begun with his office and is sure to end with it is a person who ought never to be suffered by a controuling parliament to continue in any of those situations which confer the lead and direction of all our public affairs because such a man  has no connexion with the interest of the people    THOSE knots or cabals of men who have got together avowedly without any public principle in order to sell their conjunct iniquity at the higher rate and are therefore universally odious ought never to be suffered to domineer in the state because  they have  no connexion with the sentiments and opinions of the people    THESE are considerations which in my opinion enforce the necessity of having some better reason in a free country and a free parliament for supporting the ministers of the crown than that short one  That the King has thought proper to appoint them  There is something very courtly in this But it is a principle pregnant with all sorts of mischief in a constitution like ours to turn the views of active men from the country to the court Whatever be the road to power that is the road which will be trod If the opinion of the country be of no use as a means of power or consideration the qualities which usually procure that opinion will be no longer cultivated And whether it will be right in a state so popular in its constitution as ours to leave ambition without popular motives and to trust all to the operation of pure virtue in the minds of kings and ministers and public men must be submitted to the judgment and good sense of the people of England  CUNNING men are here apt to break in and without directly controverting the principle to raise objections from the difficulty under which the sovereign labours to distinguish the genuine voice and sentiments of his people from the clamour of a faction by which it is so easily counterfeited The nation they say is generally divided into parties with views and passions utterly irreconcilable If the king should put his affairs into the hands of any one of them he is sure to disgust the rest if he select particular men from among them all it is an hazard that he disgusts them all Those who are left out however divided before will soon run into a body of opposition which being a collection of many discontents into one focus will without  doubt be hot and violent enough Faction will make its cries resound through the nation as if the whole were in an uproar when by far the majority and much the better part will seem for a while as it were annihilated by the quiet in which their virtue and moderation incline them to enjoy the blessings of government Besides that the opinion of the meer vulgar is a miserable rule even with regard to themselves on account of their violence and instability So that if you were to gratify them in their humour today that very gratification would be a ground of their dissatisfaction on the next Now as all these rules of public opinion are to be collected with great difficulty and to be applied with equal uncertainty as to the effect what better can a king of England do than to employ such men as he finds to have views and inclinations most conformable to his own who are at least infected with pride and selfwill and who are least moved by such popular humours as are perpetually traversing his designs and disturbing his service trusting that when he means no ill to his people he will be supported in his appointments whether he choses to keep or to change as his private judgment or his pleasure leads him He will find a sure resource in the real weight and influence of the crown when it is not suffered to become an instrument in the hands of a faction  I WILL not pretend to say that there is nothing at all in this mode of reasoning because I will not assert that there is no difficulty in the art of government Undoubtedly the very best administration must encounter a great deal of opposition and the very worst will find more support than it deserves Sufficient appearances will never be wanting to those who have a mind to deceive themselves It is a fallacy in constant use with those who would level  all things and confound right with wrong to insist upon the inconveniencies which are attached to every choice without taking into consideration the different weight and consequence of those inconveniencies The question is not concerning  absolute  discontent or  perfect  satisfaction in government neither of which can be pure and unmixed at any time or upon any system The controversy is about that degree of good humour in the people which may possibly be attained and ought certainly to be looked for While some politicians may be waiting to know whether the sense of every individual be against them accurately distinguishing the vulgar from the better sort drawing lines between the enterprizes of a faction and the efforts of a people they may chance to see the government which they are so nicely weighing and dividing and distinguishing tumble to the ground in the midst of their wise deliberation Prudent men when so great an object as the security of government or even its peace is at stake will not run the risk of a decision which may be fatal to it They who can read the political sky will see an hurricane in a cloud no bigger than an hand at the very edge of the horizon and will run into the first harbour No lines can be laid down for civil or political wisdom They are a matter incapable of exact definition But though no man can draw a stroke between the confines of day and night yet light and darkness are upon the whole tolerably distinguishable Nor will it be impossible for a prince to find out such a mode of government and such persons to administer it as will give a great degree of content to his people without any curious and anxious research for that abstract universal perfect harmony which while he is seeking he abandons those means of ordinary tranquillity which are in his power without any research at all  IT is not more the duty than it is the interest of a prince to aim at giving tranquillity to his government But those who advise him may have an interest in disorder and confusion If the opinion of the people is against them they will naturally wish that it should have no prevalence Here it is that the people must on their part shew themselves sensible of their own value Their whole importance in the first instance and afterwards their whole freedom is at stake Their freedom cannot long survive their importance Here it is that the natural strength of the kingdom the great peers the leading landed gentlemen the opulent merchants and manufacturers the substantial yeomanry must interpose to rescue their prince themselves and their posterity  WE are at present at issue upon this point We are in the great crisis of this contention and the part which men take one way or other will serve to discriminate their characters and their principles Until the matter is decided the country will remain in its present confusion For while a system of administration is attempted entirely repugnant to the genius of the people and not conformable to the plan of their government every thing must necessarily be disordered for a time until this system destroys the constitution or the constitution gets the the better of this system  THERE is in my opinion a peculiar venom and malignity in this political distemper beyond any that I have heard or read of In former times the projectors of arbitrary government attacked only the liberties of their country a design surely mischievous enough to have satisfied a mind of the most unruly ambition But a system unfavourable to freedom may be so formed as considerably to exalt the grandeur of the state and men may find  in the pride and splendor of that prosperity some sort of consolation for the loss of their solid privileges Indeed the increase of the power of the state has often been urged by artful men as a pretext for some abridgment of the public liberty But the scheme of the junto under consideration not only strikes a palsy into every nerve of our free constitution but in the same degree benumbs and stupifies the whole executive power rendering government in all its grand operations languid uncertain ineffective making ministers fearful of attempting and incapable of executing any useful plan of domestic arrangement or of foreign politics It tends to produce neither the security of a free government nor the energy of a monarchy that is absolute Accordingly the crown has dwindled away in proportion to the unnatural and turgid growth of this excrescence on the court  THE interior ministry are sensible that war is a situation which sets in its full light the value of the hearts of a people and they well know that the beginning of the importance of the people must be the end of theirs For this reason they discover upon all occasions the utmost fear of every thing which by possibility may lead to such an event I do not mean that they manifest any of that pious fear which is backward to commit the safety of the country to the dubious experiment of war Such a fear being the tender sensation of virtue excited as it is regulated by reason frequently shews itself in a seasonable boldness which keeps danger at a distance by seeming to despise it Their fear betrays to the first glance of the eye its true cause and its real object Foreign powers confident in the knowledge of their character have not scrupled to violate the most solemn treaties and in defiance  of them to make conquests in the midst of a general peace and in the heart of Europe Such was the conquest of Corsica by the professed enemies of the freedom of mankind in defiance of those who were formerly its professed defenders We have had just claims upon the same powers rights which ought to have been sacred to them as well as to us as they had their origin in our lenity and generosity towards France and Spain in the day of their great humiliation Such I call the ransom of Manilla and the demand on France for the East India prisoners But these powers put a just confidence in their resource of the  double cabinet  These demands one of them at least are hastening fast towards an acquittal by prescription Oblivion begins to spread her cobwebs over all our spirited remonstrances Some of the most valuable branches of our trade are also on the point of perishing from the same cause I do not mean those branches which bear without the hand of the vinedresser I mean those which the policy of treaties had formerly secured to us I mean to mark and distinguish the trade of Portugal the loss of which and the power of the cabal have one and the same aera  IF by any chance the ministers who stand before the curtain possess or affect any spirit it makes little or no impression Foreign courts and ministers who were among the first to discover and to profit by this invention of the  double cabinet  attend very little to their remonstrances They know that those shadows of ministers have nothing to do in the ultimate disposal of things Jealousies and animosities are sedulously nourished in the outward administration and have been even considered as a  causa sine qua non  in its constitution thence foreign courts have a certainty that nothing can be done by common counsel in this nation If one of those  ministers officially takes up a business with spirit it serves only the better to signalize the meanness of the rest and the discord of them all His collegues in office are in haste to shake them off and to disclaim the whole of his proceedings Of this nature was that astonishing transaction in which lord Rochford our ambassador at Paris remonstrated against the attempt upon Corsica in consequence of a direct authority from lord Shelburne This remonstrance the French minister treated with the contempt that was natural as he was assured from the ambassador of his court to ours that these orders of lord Shelburne were not supported by the rest of the I had like to have said British administration Lord Rochford a man of spirit could not endure this situation The consequences were however curious He returns from Paris and comes home full of anger Lord Shelburne who gave the orders is obliged to give up the seals Lord Rochford who obeyed these orders receives them He goes however into another department of the same office that he might not be obliged officially to acquiesce in one situation under what he had officially remonstrated against in another At Paris the duke of Choiseul considered this office arrangement as a compliment to him here it was spoke of as an attention to the delicacy of lord Rochford But whether the compliment was to one or both to this nation it was the same By this transaction the condition of our court lay exposed in all its nakedness Our office correspondence has lost all pretence to authenticity British policy is brought into derision in those nations that a while ago trembled at the power of our arms whilst they looked up with confidence to the equity firmness and candour which shone in all our negociations I represent this matter exactly  in the light in which it has been universally received  SUCH has been the aspect of our foreign politics under the influence of a  double cabinet  With such an arrangement at court it is impossible it should have been otherwise Nor is it possible that this scheme should have a better effect upon the government of our dependencies the first the dearest and most delicate objects of the interior policy of this empire The colonies know that administration is separated from the court divided within itself and detested by the nation The  double cabinet  has in both the parts of it shewn the most malignant dispositions towards them without being able to do them the smallest mischief  THEY are convinced by sufficient experience that no plan either of lenity or rigour can be pursued with uniformity and perseverance Therefore they turn their eyes entirely from Great Britain where they have neither dependence on friendship nor apprehension from enmity They look to themselves and their own arrangements They grow every day into alienation from this country and whilst they are becoming disconnected with our government we have not the consolation to find that they are even friendly in their new independence Nothing can equal the futility the weakness the rashness the timidity the perpetual contradiction in the management of our affairs in that part of the world A volume might be written on this melancholy subject but it were better to leave it entirely to the reflexions of the reader himself than not to treat it in the extent it deserves  IN what manner our domestic oeconomy is affected by this system it is needless to explain It is the perpetual subject of their own complaints  THE court party resolve the whole into faction Having said something before upon this subject I shall only observe here that when they give this account of the prevalence of faction they present no very favourable aspect of the confidence of the people in their own government They may be assured that however they amuse themselves with a variety of projects for substituting something else in the place of that great and only foundation of government the confidence of the people every attempt will but make their condition worse When men imagine that their food is only a cover for poison and when they neither love nor trust the hand that serves it it is not the name of the roast beef of old England that will persuade them to sit down to the table that is spread for them When the people conceive that laws and tribunals and even even popular assemblies are perverted from the ends of their institution they find in those names of degenerated establishments only new motives to discontent Those bodies which when full of life and beauty lay in their arms and were their joy and comfort when dead and putrid become but the more loathsome from remembrance of former endearments A sullen gloom and furious disorder prevail by fits the nation loses its relish for peace and prosperity as it did in that season of fulness which opened our troubles in the time of Charles the first A species of men to whom a state of order would become a sentence of obscurity are nourished into a dangerous magnitude by the heat of intestine disturbances and it is no wonder that by a sort of sinister piety they cherish in their turn the disorders which are the parents of all their consequence Superficial observers consider such persons as the cause of the public uneasiness when in truth they are nothing more than the effect of it Good men look upon this distracted scene  with sorrow and indignation Their hands are tied behind them They are despoiled of all the power which might enable them to reconcile the strength of government with the rights of the people They stand in a most distressing alternative But in the election among evils they hope better things from temporary confusion than from established servitude In the mean time the voice of law is not to be heard Fierce licentiousness begets violent restraints The military arm is the sole reliance and then call your constitution what you please it is the sword that governs The civil power like every other that calls in the aid of an ally stronger than itself perishes by the assistance it receives But the contrivers of this scheme of government will not trust solely to the military power because they are cunning men Their restless and crooked spirit drives them to rake in the dirt of every kind of expedient Unable to rule the multitude they endeavour to raise divisions amongst them One mob is hired to destroy another a procedure which at once encourages the boldness of the populace and justly increases their discontent Men become pensioners of state on account of their abilities in the array of riot and the discipline of confusion Government is put under the disgraceful necessity of protecting from the severity of the laws that very licentiousness which the laws had been before violated to repress Every thing partakes of the original disorder Anarchy predominates without freedom and servitude without submission or subordination These are the consequences inevitable to our public peace from the scheme of rendering the executory government at once odious and feeble of freeing administration from the constitutional and salutary controul of parliament and inventing for it a  new controul  unknown to the constitution an  interior cabinet  which brings the  whole body of government into confusion and contempt  AFTER having stated as shortly as I am able the effects of this system on our foreign affairs on the policy of our government with regard to our dependencies and on the interior oeconomy of the commonwealth there remains only in this part of my design to say something of the grand principle which first recommended this system at court The pretence was to prevent the king from being enslaved by a faction and made a prisoner in his closet This scheme might have been expected to answer at least its own end and to indemnify the king in his personal capacity for all the confusion into which it has thrown his government But has it in reality answered this purpose I am sure if it had every affectionate subject would have one motive for enduring with patience all the evils which attend it  IN order to come at the truth in this matter it may not be amiss to consider it somewhat in detail I speak here of the king and not of the crown the interests of which we have already touched Independent of that greatness which a king possesses merely by being a representative of the national dignity the things in which he may have an individual interest seem to be these wealth accumulated wealth spent in magnificence pleasure or beneficence personal respect and attention and above all private ease and repose of mind These compose the inventory of prosperous circumstances whether they regard a prince or a subject their enjoyments differing only in the scale upon which they are formed  SUPPOSE then we were to ask whether the king has been richer than his predecessors in accumulated  wealth since the establishment of the plan of favouritism I believe it will be found that the picture of royal indigence which our court has presented until this year has been truly humiliating Nor has it been relieved from this unseemly distress but by means which have hazarded the affection of the people and shaken their confidence in parliament If the public treasures had been exhausted in magnificence and splendour this distress would have been accounted for and in some measure justified Nothing would be more unworthy of this nation than with a mean and mechanical rule to mete out the splendour of the crown Indeed I have found very few persons disposed to so ungenerous a procedure But the generality of people it must be confessed do feel a good deal mortified when they compare the wants of the court with its expences They do not behold the cause of this distress in any part of the apparatus of royal magnificence In all this they see nothing but the operations of parsimony attended with all the consequences of profusion Nothing expended nothing saved Their wonder is increased by their knowledge that besides the revenue settled on his majesty's civil list to the amount of  l  a year he has a farther aid from a large pension list near  l  a year in Ireland from the produce of the dutchy of Lancaster which we are told has been greatly improved from the revenue of the dutchy of Cornwall from the American quitrents from the four and a half  per cent  duty in the Leeward Islands this last worth to be sure considerably more than  l  a year The whole is certainly not much short of a million annually  THESE are revenues within the knowledge and cognizance of our national councils We have no direct right to examine into the receipts from his  majesty's German dominions and the bishopric of Osnabrug This is unquestionably true But that which is not within the province of parliament is yet within the sphere of every man's own reflection If a foreign prince resided amongst us the state of his revenues could not fail of becoming the subject of our speculation Filled with an anxious concern for whatever regards the welfare of our sovereign it is impossible in considering the miserable circumstances into which he has been brought that this obvious topic should be entirely passed over There is an opinion universal that these revenues produce something not inconsiderable clear of all charges and establishments This produce the people do not believe to be hoarded nor perceive to be spent It is accounted for in the only manner it can by supposing that it is drawn away for the support of that court faction which whilst it distresses the nation impoverishes the prince in every one of his resources I once more caution the reader that I do not urge this consideration concerning the foreign revenue as if I supposed we had a direct right to examine into the expenditure of any part of it but solely for the purpose of shewing how little this system of favouritism has been advantageous to the monarch himself which without magnificence has sunk him into a state of unnatural poverty at the same time that he possessed every means of affluence from ample revenues both in this country and in other parts of his dominions  HAS this system provided better for the treatment becoming his high and sacred character and secured the king from those disgusts attached to the necessity of employing men who are not personally agreeable This is a topic upon which for many reasons I could wish to be silent but the pretence of securing against such causes of uneasiness is the  cornerstone of the court party It has however so happened that if I were to fix upon any one point in which this system has been more particularly and shamefully blameable the effects which it has produced would justify me in choosing for that point its tendency to degrade the personal dignity of the sovereign and to expose him to a thousand contradictions and mortifications It is but too evident in what manner these projectors of royal greatness have fulfilled all their magnificent promises Without recapitulating all the circumstances of the reign every one of which is more or less a melancholy proof of the truth of what I have advanced let us consider the language of the court but a few years ago concerning most of the persons now in the external administration let me ask whether any enemy to the personal feelings of the sovereign could possibly contrive a keener instrument of mortification and degradation of all dignity than almost every part and member of the present arrangement nor in the whole course of our history has any compliance with the will of the people ever been known to extort from any prince a greater contradiction to all his own declared affections and dislikes than that which is now adopted in direct opposition to every thing the people approve and desire  AN opinion prevails that greatness has been more than once advised to submit to certain condescensions towards individuals which have been denied to the entreaties of a nation For the meanest and most dependent instrument of this system knows that there are hours when its existence may depend upon his adherence to it and he takes his advantage accordingly Indeed it is a law of nature that whoever is necessary to what we have made our object is sure in some way or in some  time or other to become our master All this however is submitted to in order to avoid that monstrous evil of governing in concurrence with the opinion of the people For it seems to be laid down as a maxim that a king has some sort of interest in giving uneasiness to his subjects that all who are pleasing to them are to be of course disagreeable to him that as soon as the persons who are odious at court are known to be odious to the people it is snatched at as a lucky occasion of showering down upon them all kinds of emoluments and honours None are considered as wellwishers to the crown but those who advise to some unpopular course of action none capable of serving it but those who are obliged to call at every instant upon all its power for the safety of their lives None are supposed to be fit priests in the temple of government but the persons who are compelled to fly into it for sanctuary Such is the effect of this refined project such is ever the result of all the contrivances which are used to free men from the servitude of their reason and from the necessity of ordering their affairs according to their evident interests These contrivances oblige them to run into a real and ruinous servitude in order to avoid a supposed restraint that might be attended with advantage  IF therefore this system has so ill answered its own grand pretence of saving the king from the necessity of employing persons disagreeable to him has it given more peace and tranquillity to his majesty's private hours No most certainly The father of his people cannot possibly enjoy repose while his family is in such a state of distraction Then what has the crown or the king profited by all this finewrought scheme Is he more rich or more splendid or more powerful or more at his ease by so many labours and contrivances Have  they not beggared his Exchequer tarnished the splendour of his court sunk his dignity galled his feelings discomposed the whole order and happiness of his private life  IT will be very hard I believe to state in what respect the king has profited by that faction which presumptuously choose to call themselves  his friends    IF particular men had grown into an attachment by the distinguished honour of the society of their sovereign and by being the partakers of his amusements came sometimes to prefer the gratification of his personal inclinations to the support of his high character the thing would be very natural and it would be excusable enough But the pleasant part of the story is that these  King's friends  have no more ground for usurping such a title than a resident freeholder in Cumberland or in Cornwall They are only known to their sovereign by kissing his hand for the offices pensions and grants into which they have deceived his benignity May no storm ever come which will put the firmness of their attachment to the proof and which in the midst of confusions and terrors and sufferings may demonstrate the eternal difference between a true and severe friend to the monarchy and a slippery sycophant of the court  Quantum infido scurrae distabit amicus  SO far I have considered the effect of the court system chiefly as it operates upon the executive government on the temper of the people and on the happiness of the sovereign It remains that we should consider with a little attention its operation upon parliament  PARLIAMENT was indeed the great object of all these politics the end at which they aimed as well as the instrument by which they were to operate  But before parliament could be made subservient to a system by which it was to be degraded from the dignity of a national council into a mere member of the court it must be greatly changed from its original character  IN speaking of this body I have my eye chiefly on the house of commons I hope I shall be indulged in a few observations on the nature and character of that assembly not with regard to its  legal form and power  but to its  spirit  and to the purposes it is meant to answer in the constitution  THE house of commons was supposed originally to be  no part of the standing government of this country  It was considered as a  controul  issuing  immediately  from the people and speedily to be resolved into the mass from whence it arose In this respect it was in the higher part of government what juries are in the lower The capacity of a magistrate being transitory and that of a citizen permanent the latter capacity it was hoped would of course preponderate in all discussions not only between the people and the standing authority of the crown but between the people and the fleeting authority of the house of commons itself It was hoped that being of a middle nature between subject and government they would feel with a more tender and a nearer interest every thing that concerned the people than the other remoter and more permanent parts of legislature  WHATEVER alterations time and the necessary accommodation of business may have introduced this character can never be sustained unless the house of commons shall be made to bear some stamp of the actual disposition of the people at large It would among public misfortunes be an evil more natural and tolerable that the house  of commons should be infected with every epidemical phrensy of the people as this would indicate some consanguinity some sympathy of nature with their constituents than that they should in all cases be wholly untouched by the opinions and feelings of the people out of doors By this want of sympathy they would cease to be an house of commons For it is not the derivation of the power of that house from the people which makes it in a distinct sense their representative The king is the representative of the people so are the lords so are the judges They all are trustees for the people as well as the commons because no power is given for the sole sake of the holder and although government certainly is an institution of divine authority yet its forms and the persons who administer it all originate from the people  A POPULAR origin cannot therefore be the characteristical distinction of a popular representative This belongs equally to all parts of government and in all forms The virtue spirit and essence of a house of commons consists in its being the express image of the feelings of the nation It was not instituted to be a controul  upon  the people as of late it has been taught by a doctrine of the most pernicious tendency It was designed as a controul  for  the people Other institutions have been formed for the purpose of checking popular excesses and they are I apprehend fully adequate to their object If not they ought to be made so The house of commons as it was never intended for the support of peace and subordination is miserably appointed for that service having no stronger weapon than its mace and no better officer than its serjeant at arms which it can command of its own proper authority A vigilant and jealous eye over executory and judicial magistracy  an anxious care of public money an openness approaching towards facility to public complaint these seem to be the true characteristics of an house of commons But an addressing house of commons and a petitioning nation an house of commons full of confidence when the nation is plunged in despair in the utmost harmony with ministers whom the people regard with the utmost abhorrence who vote thanks when the public opinion calls upon them for impeachments who are eager to grant when the general voice demands account who in all disputes between the people and administration presume against the people who punish their disorders but refuse even to enquire into the provocations to them this is an unnatural a monstrous state of things in this constitution Such an assembly may be a great wise aweful senate but it is not to any popular purpose an house of commons This change from an immediate state of procuration and delegation to a course of acting as from original power is the way in which all the popular magistracies in the world have been perverted from their purposes It is indeed their greatest and sometimes their incurable corruption For there is a material distinction between that corruption by which particular points are carried against reason this is a thing which cannot be prevented by human wisdom and is of less consequence and the corruption of the principle itself For then the evil is not accidental but settled The distemper becomes the natural habit  FOR my part I shall be compelled to conclude the principle of parliament to be totally corrupted and therefore its ends entirely defeated when I see two symptoms first a rule of indiscriminate support to all ministers because this destroys the  very end of parliament as a controul and is a general previous sanction to misgovernment and secondly the setting up any claims adverse to the right of free election for this tends to subvert the legal authority by which the house of commons sits  I KNOW that since the Revolution along with many dangerous many useful powers of government have been weakened It is absolutely necessary to have frequent recourse to the legislature Parliaments must therefore sit every year and for great part of the year The dreadful disorders of frequent elections have also necessitated a septennial instead of a triennial duration These circumstances I mean the constant habit of authority and the unfrequency of elections have tended very much to draw the house of commons towards the character of a standing senate It is a disorder which has arisen from the cure of greater disorders it has arisen from the extreme difficulty of reconciling liberty under a monarchical government with external strength and with internal tranquillity  IT is very clear that we cannot free ourselves entirely from this great inconvenience but I would not increase an evil because I was not able to remove it and because it was not in my power to keep the house of commons religiously true to its first principles I would not argue for carrying it to a total oblivion of them This has been the great scheme of power in our time They who will not conform their conduct to the public good and cannot support it by the prerogative of the crown have adopted a new plan They have totally abandoned the shattered and oldfashioned fortress of prerogative and made a lodgement in the stronghold of parliament itself If they have  any evil design to which there is no ordinary legal power commensurate they bring it into parliament In parliament the whole is executed from the beginning to the end In parliament the power of obtaining their object is absolute and the safety in the proceeding perfect no rules to confine no after reckonings to terrify Parliament cannot with any great propriety punish others for things in which they themselves have been accomplices Thus the controul of parliament upon the executory power is lost because parliament is made to partake in every considerable act of government  Impeachment that great guardian of the purity of the constitution is in danger of being lost even to the idea of it  BY this plan several important ends are answered to the cabal If the authority of parliament supports itself the credit of every act of government which they contrive is saved but if the act be so very odious that the whole strength of parliament is insufficient to recommend it then parliament is itself discredited and this discredit increases more and more that indifference to the constitution which it is the constant aim of its enemies by their abuse of parliamentary powers to render general among the people Whenever parliament is persuaded to assume the offices of executive government it will lose all the confidence love and veneration which it has ever enjoyed whilst it was supposed the  corrective and controul  of the acting powers of the state This would be the event though its conduct in such a perversion of its functions should be tolerably just and moderate but if it should be iniquitous violent full of passion and full of faction it would be considered as the most intolerable of all the modes of tyranny  FOR a considerable time this separation of the representatives from their constituents went on with a silent progress and had those who conducted the plan for their total separation been persons of temper and abilities any way equal to the magnitude of their design the success would have been infallible but by their precipitancy they have laid it open in all its nakedness the nation is alarmed at it and the event may not be pleasant to the contrivers of the scheme In the last session the corps called the  king's friends  made an hardy attempt all at once  to alter the right of election itself  to put it into the power of the house of commons to disable any person disagreeable to them from sitting in parliament without any other rule than their own pleasure to make incapacities either general for descriptions of men or particular for individuals and to take into their body persons who avowedly had never been chosen by the majority of legal electors nor agreeably to any known rule of law  THE arguments upon which this claim was founded and combated are not my business here Never has a subject been more amply and more learnedly handled nor upon one side in my opinion more satisfactorily they who are not convinced by what is already written would not receive conviction  though one arose from the dead    I TOO have thought on this subject but my purpose here is only to consider it as a part of the favourite project of government to observe on the motives which led to it and to trace its political consequences  A VIOLENT rage for the punishment of Mr Wilkes was the pretence of the whole This gentleman by setting himself strongly in opposition  to the court cabal had become at once an object of their persecution and of the popular favour The hatred of the court party pursuing and the countenance of the people protecting him it very soon became not at all a question on the man but a trial of strength between the two parties The advantage of the victory in this particular contest was the present but not the only nor by any means the principal object Its operation upon the character of the house of commons was the great point in view The point to be gained by the cabal was this that a precedent should be established tending to shew  That the favour of the people was not so sure a road as the favour of the court even to popular honours and popular trusts  A strenuous resistance to every appearance of lawless power a spirit of independence carried to some degree of enthusiasm an inquisitive character to discover and a bold one to display every corruption and every error of government these are the qualities which recommend a man to a seat in the house of commons in open and merely popular elections An indolent and submissive disposition a disposition to think charitably of all the actions of men in power and to live in a mutual intercourse of favours with them an inclination rather to countenance a strong use of authority than to bear any sort of licentiousness on the part of the people these are unfavourable qualities in an open election for members of parliament  THE instinct which carries the people towards the choice of the former is justified by reason because a man of such a character even in its exorbitancies does not directly contradict the purposes of a trust the end of which is a controul on power The latter character even when it is not in its extreme will execute this trust but very  imperfectly and if deviating to the least excess will certainly frustrate instead of forwarding the purposes of a controul on government But when the house of commons was to be new modelled this principle was not only to be changed but reversed Whilst any errors committed in support of power were left to the law with every advantage of favourable construction or mitigation and finally of pardon all excesses on the side of liberty or in pursuit of popular favour or in defence of popular rights and privileges were not only to be punished by the rigour of the known law but by a  discretionary  proceeding which brought on  the loss of the popular object itself  Popularity was to be rendered if not directly penal at least highly dangerous The favour of the people might lead even to a disqualification of representing them Their odium might become strained through the medium of two or three constructions the means of sitting as the trustee of all that was dear to them This is punishing the offence in the offending part Until this time the opinion of the people through the power of an assembly still in some sort popular led to the greatest honours and emoluments in the gift of the crown Now the principle is reversed and the favour of the court is the only sure way of obtaining and holding those honours which ought to be in the disposal of the people  IT signifies very little how this matter may be quibbled away Example the only argument of effect in civil life demonstrates the truth of my proposition Nothing can alter my opinion concerning the pernicious tendency of this example until I see some man for his indiscretion in the support of power for his violent and intemperate servility rendered incapable of sitting in parliament  For as it now stands the fault of overstraining popular qualities and irregularly if you please asserting popular privileges has led to disqualification the opposite fault never has produced the slightest punishment Resistance to power has shut the door of the House of Commons to one man obsequiousness and servility to none  NOT that I would encourage popular disorder or any disorder But I would leave such offences to the law to be punished in measure and proportion The laws of this country are for the most part constituted and wisely so for the general ends of government rather than for the preservation of our particular liberties Whatever therefore is done in support of liberty by persons not in public trust or not acting merely in that trust is liable to be more or less out of the ordinary course of the law and the law itself is sufficient to animadvert upon it with great severity Nothing indeed can hinder that severe letter from crushing us except the temperaments it may receive from a trial by jury But if the habit prevails of  going beyond the law  and superseding this judicature of carrying offences real or supposed into the legislative bodies who shall establish themselves into  courts of criminal equity  so the  Star Chamber  has been called by lord Bacon all the evils of the  Star Chamber  are revived A large and liberal construction in ascertaining offences and a discretionary power in punishing them is the idea of  criminal equity  which is in truth a monster in jurisprudence It signifies nothing whether a court for this purpose be a committee of council or an house of commons or an house of lords the liberty of the subject will be equally subverted by it The true end and purpose of that house of parliament which entertains such a jurisdiction will be destroyed by it  I WILL not believe what no other man living believes that Mr Wilkes was punished for the indecency of his publications or the impiety of his ransacked closet If he had fallen in a common slaughter of libellers and blasphemers I could well believe that nothing more was meant than was pretended But when I see that for years together full as impious and perhaps more dangerous writings to religion and virtue and order have not been punished nor their authors discountenanced that the most audacious libels on royal majesty have passed without notice that the most treasonable invectives against the laws liberties and constitution of the country have not met with the slightest animadversion I must consider this as a shocking and shameless pretence Never did an envenomed scurrility against every thing sacred and civil public and private rage through the kingdom with such a furious and unbridled licence All this while the peace of the nation must be shaken to ruin one libeller and to tear from the populace a single favourite  NOR is it that vice merely skulks in an obscure and contemptible impunity Does not the public behold with indignation persons not only generally scandalous in their lives but the identical persons who by their society their instruction their example their encouragement have drawn this man into the very faults which have furnished the cabal with a pretence for his persecution loaded with every kind of favour honour and distinction which a court can bestow Add but the crime of servility the  foedum crimen servitutis  to every other crime and the whole mass is immediately transmuted into virtue and becomes the just subject of reward and honour When therefore I reflect upon this method pursued by the cabal in distributing  rewards and punishments I must conclude that Mr Wilkes is the object of persecution not on account of what he has done in common with others who are the objects of reward but for that in which he differs from many of them that he is pursued for the spirited dispositions which are blended with his vices for his unconquerable firmness for his resolute indefatigable strenuous resistance against oppression  IN this case therefore it was not the man that was to be punished nor his faults that were to be discountenanced Opposition to acts of power was to be marked by a kind of civil proscription The popularity which should arise from such an opposition was to be shewn unable to protect it The qualities by which court is made to the people were to render every fault inexpiable and every error irretrievable The qualities by which court is made to power were to cover and to sanctify every thing He that will have a sure and honourable seat in the house of commons must take care how he adventures to cultivate popular qualities otherwise he may remember the old maxim  Breves et infaustos populi Romani amores  If therefore a pursuit of popularity expose a man to greater dangers than a disposition to servility the principle which is the life and soul of popular elections will perish out of the constitution  IT behoves the people of England to consider how the house of commons under the operation of these examples must of necessity be constituted On the side of the court will be all honours offices emoluments every sort of personal gratification to avarice or vanity and what is of more moment to most gentlemen the means of growing by innumerable petty services to individuals into a spreading interest in their country  On the other hand let us suppose a person unconnected with the court and in opposition to its system For his own person no office or emolument or title no promotion ecclesiastical or civil or military or naval for children or brothers or kindred In vain an expiring interest in a borough calls for offices or small livings for the children of mayors and aldermen and capital burgesses His court rival has them all He can do an infinite number of acts of generosity and kindness and even of public spirit He can procure indemnity from quarters He can procure advantages in trade He can get pardons for offences He can obtain a thousand favours and avert a thousand evils He may while he betrays every valuable interest of the kingdom be a benefactor a patron a father a guardian angel to his borough The unfortunate independent member has nothing to offer but harsh refusal or pitiful excuse or despondent representation of an hopeless interest Except from his private fortune in which he may be equalled perhaps exceeded by his court competitor he has no way of shewing any one good quality or of making a single friend In the house he votes for ever in a dispirited minority If he speaks the doors are locked A body of loquacious placemen go out to tell the world that all he aims at is to get into office If he has not the talent of elocution which is the case of many as wise and knowing men as any in the house he is liable to all these inconveniencies without the eclat which attends upon any tolerably successful exertion of eloquence Can we receive a more discouraging post of duty than this Strip it of the poor reward of popularity suffer even the excesses committed in defence of the popular interest to become a ground for the majority of that house to form a disqualification out of the line of the law and at  their pleasure attended not only with the loss of the franchise but with every kind of personal disgraceIf this shall happen the people of this kingdom may be assured that they cannot be firmly or faithfully served by any man It is out of the nature of men and things that they should and their presumption will be equal to their folly if they expect it The power of the people within the laws must shew itself sufficient to protect every representative in the animated performance of his duty or that duty cannot be performed The house of commons can never be a controul on other parts of government unless they are controuled themselves by their constituents and unless these constituents possess some right in the choice of that house which it is not in the power of that house to take away If they suffer this power of arbitrary incapacitation to stand they have utterly perverted every other power of the house of commons The late proceeding I will not say  is  contrary to law it  must  be so for the power which is claimed cannot by any possibility be a legal power in any limited member of government  THE power which they claim of declaring incapacities would not be above the just claims of a final judicature if they had not laid it down as a leading principle that they had no rule in the exercise of this claim but their own  discretion  Not one of their abettors has ever undertaken to assign the principle of unfitness the species or degree of delinquency on which the house of commons will expel nor the mode of proceeding upon it nor the evidence upon which it is established The direct consequence of which is that the first franchise of an Englishman and that on which all the rest vitally depend is to be forfeited for some  offence which no man knows and which is to be proved by no known rule whatsoever of legal evidence This is so anomalous to our whole constitution that I will venture to say the most trivial right which the subject claims never was nor can be forfeited in such a manner  THE whole of their usurpation is established upon this method of arguing We do not  make  laws No we do not contend for this power We only  declare  law and as we are a tribunal both competent and supreme what we declare to be law becomes law although it should not have been so before Thus the circumstance of having no  appeal  from their jurisdiction is made to imply that they have no  rule  in the exercise of it the judgment does not derive its validity from its conformity to the law but preposterously the law is made to attend on the judgment and the rule of the judgment is no other than the  occasional will of the house  An arbitrary discretion leads legality follows which is just the very nature and description of a legislative act  THIS claim in their hands was no barren theory It was pursued into its utmost consequences and a dangerous principle has begot a correspondent practice A systematic spirit has been shewn upon both sides The electors of Middlesex chose a person whom the house of commons had voted incapable and the house of commons has taken in a member whom the electors of Middlesex had not chosen By a construction on that legislative power which had been assumed they declared that the true legal sense of the county was contained in the minority on that occasion and might on a resistance to a vote of incapacity be contained in any minority  WHEN any construction of law goes against the spirit of the privilege it was meant to support it is a vicious construction It is material to us to be represented really and  bona fide  and not in Forms in types and shadows and fictions of law The right of election was not established merely as a  matter of form  to satisfy some method and rule of technical reasoning it was not a principle which might substitute a  Titius  or a  Maevius  a  John Doe  or  Richard Roe  in the place of a man specially chosen not a principle which was just as well satisfied with one man as with another It is a right the effect of which is to give to the people that man and  that man only  whom by their voices actually not constructively given they declare that they know esteem love and trust This right is a matter within their own power of judging and feeling not an  ens rationis  and creature of law nor can those devices by which any thing else is substituted in the place of such an actual choice answer in the least degree the end of representation  I KNOW that the courts of law have made as strained constructions in other cases Such is the construction in common recoveries The method of construction which in that case gives to the persons in remainder for their security and representative the doorkeeper cryer or sweeper of the court or some other shadowy being without substance or effect is a fiction of a very coarse texture This was however suffered by the acquiescence of the whole kingdom for ages because the evasion of the old statute of Westminster which authorised perpetuities had more sense and utility than the law which was evaded But an attempt to turn the right of election into such a farce and mockery as a fictitious fine and recovery  will I hope have another fate because the laws which give it are infinitely dear to us and the evasion is infinitely contemptible  THE people indeed have been told that this power of discretionary disqualification is vested in hands that they may trust and who will be sure not to abuse it to their prejudice Until I find something in this argument differing from that on which every mode of despotism has been defended I shall not be inclined to pay it any great compliment The people are satisfied to trust themselves with the exercise of their own privileges and do not desire this kind intervention of the house of commons to free them from the burthen They are certainly in the right They ought not to trust the house of commons with a power over their franchises because the constitution which placed two other coordinate powers to controul it reposed no such confidence in that body It were a folly well deserving servitude for its punishment to be full of confidence where the laws are full of distrust and to give to an house of commons arrogating to its sole resolution the most harsh and odious part of legislative authority that degree of submission which is due only to the legislature itself  WHEN the house of commons in an endeavour to obtain new advantages at the expence of the other orders of the state for the benefit of the  commons at large  have pursued strong measures if it were not just it was at least natural that the constituents should connive at all their proceedings because we were ourselves ultimately to profit But when this submission is urged to us in a contest between the representatives and ourselves and where nothing can be put into their scale which is not taken from ours they fancy us to be children when they tell us they are our representatives  our own flesh and blood and that all the stripes they give us are for our good The very desire of that body to have such a trust contrary to law reposed in them shews that they are not worthy of it They certainly will abuse it because all men possessed of an uncontrouled discretionary power leading to the aggrandisement and profit of their own body have always abused it and I see no particular sanctity in our times that is at all likely by a miraculous operation to overrule the course of nature  BUT we must purposely shut our eyes if we consider this matter merely as a contest between the house of commons and the electors The true contest is between the electors of the kingdom and the crown the crown acting by an instrumental house of commons It is precisely the same whether the ministers of the crown can disqualify by a dependent house of commons or by a dependent court of  star chamber  or by a dependent court of king's bench If once members of parliament can be practically convinced that they do not depend on the affection or opinion of the people for their political being they will give themselves over without even an appearance of reserve to the influence of the court  INDEED a parliament unconnected with the people is essential to a ministry unconnected with the people and therefore those who saw through what mighty difficulties the interior ministry waded and the exterior were dragged in this business will conceive of what prodigious importance the new corps of  king's men  held this principle of occasional and personal incapacitation to the whole body of their design  WHEN the house of commons was thus made to consider itself as the master of its constituents there wanted but one thing to secure that house against all possible future deviation towards popularity an  unlimited  fund of money to be laid out according to the pleasure of the court  TO compleat the scheme of bringing our court to a resemblance to the neighbouring monarchies it was necessary in effect to destroy those appropriations of revenue which seem to limit the property as the other laws had done the powers of the crown An opportunity for this purpose was taken upon an application to parliament for payment of the debts of the civil list which in had amounted to  l  Such application had been made upon former occasions but to do it in the former manner would by no means answer the present purpose  WHENEVER the crown had come to the commons to desire a supply for the discharging of debts due on the civil list it was always asked and granted with one of the three following qualifications sometimes with all of them Either it was stated that the revenue had been diverted from its purposes by parliament or that those duties had fallen short of the sum for which they were given by parliament and that the intention of the legislature had not been fulfilled or that the money required to discharge the civil list debt was to be raised chargeable on the civil list duties In the reign of queen Anne the crown was found in debt The lessening and granting away some part of her revenue by parliament was alleged as the cause of that debt and pleaded as an equitable ground such it certainly was for discharging it It does not appear that the duties which were then applied to the ordinary government produced clear above    l  a year because when they were afterwards granted to George the first  l  was added to complete the whole to  l  a year Indeed it was then asserted and I have no doubt truly that for many years the net produce did not amount to above  l  The queen's extraordinary charges were besides very considerable equal at least to any we have known in our time The application to parliament was not for an absolute grant of money but to empower the queen to raise it by borrowing upon the civil list funds  THE civil list debt was twice paid in the reign of George the first The money was granted upon the same plan which had been followed in the reign of queen Anne The civil list revenues were then mortgaged for the sum to be raised and stood charged with the ransom of their own deliverance  GEORGE the second received an addition to his civil list Duties were granted for the purpose of raising  l  a year It was not until he had reigned nineteen years and after the last rebellion that he called upon parliament for a discharge of the civil list debt The extraordinary charges brought on by the rebellion account fully for the necessities of the crown However the extraordinary charges of government were not thought a ground fit to be relied on  A DEFICIENCY of the civil list duties for several years before was stated as the principal if not the sole ground on which an application to parliament could be justified About this time the produce of these duties had fallen pretty low and even upon an average of the whole reign they never produced  l  a year clear to the treasury  THAT prince reigned fourteen years afterwards not only no new demands were made but with  so much good order were his revenues and expences regulated that although many parts of the establishment of the court were upon a larger and more liberal scale than they have been since there was a considerable sum in hand on his decease amounting to about  l  applicable to the service of the civil list of his present majesty So that if this reign commenced with a greater charge than usual there was enough and more than enough abundantly to supply all the extraordinary expence That the civil list should have been exceeded in the two former reigns especially in the reign of George the first was not at all surprizing His revenue was but  l  annually if it ever produced so much clear The prodigious and dangerous disaffection to the very being of the establishment and the cause of a Pretender then powerfully abetted from abroad produced many demands of an extraordinary nature both abroad and at home Much management and great expences were necessary But the throne of no prince has stood upon more unshaken foundations than that of his present majesty  TO have exceeded the sum given for the civil list and to have incurred a debt without special authority of parliament was  prima facie  a criminal act as such ministers ought naturally rather to have withdrawn it from the inspection than to have exposed it to the scrutiny of parliament Certainly they ought of themselves officiously to have come armed with every sort of argument which by explaining could excuse a matter in itself of presumptive guilt But the terrors of the house of commons are no longer for ministers  ON the other hand the peculiar character of the house of commons as trustee of the public purse would have led them to call with a punctilious solicitude  for every public account and to have examined into them with the most rigorous accuracy  THE capital use of an account is that the reality of the charge the reason of incurring it and the justice and necessity of discharging it should all appear antecedent to the payment No man ever pays first and calls for his account afterwards because he would thereby let out of his hands the principal and indeed only effectual means of compelling a full and fair one But in national business there is an additional reason for a previous production of every account It is a check perhaps the only one upon a corrupt and prodigal use of public money An account after payment is to no rational purpose an account However the house of commons thought all these to be antiquated principles they were of opinion that the most parliamentary way of proceeding was to pay first what the court thought proper to demand and to take its chance for an examination into accounts at some time of greater leisure  THE nation had settled  l  a year on the crown as sufficient for the support of its dignity upon the estimate of its own ministers When ministers came to parliament and said that this allowance had not been sufficient for the purpose and that they had incurred a debt of  l  would it not have been natural for parliament first to have asked how and by what means their appropriated allowance came to be insufficient Would it not have favoured of some attention to justice to have seen in what periods of administration this debt had been originally incurred that they might discover and if need were animadvert on the persons who were found the most culpable To put their hands upon such articles of expenditure as they thought improper or excessive and to secure in future  against such misapplication or exceeding Accounts for any other purposes are but a matter of curiosity and no genuine parliamentary object All the accounts which could answer any parliamentary end were refused or postponed by previous questions Every idea of prevention was rejected as conveying an improper suspicion of the ministers of the crown  WHEN every leading account had been refused many others were granted with sufficient facility  BUT with great candour also the house was informed that hardly any of them could be ready until the next session some of them perhaps not so soon But in order firmly to establish the precedent of  payment previous to account  and to form it into a settled rule of the house the god in the machine was brought down nothing less than the wonderworking  Law of Parliament  It was alleged that it is the law of parliament when any demand comes from the crown that the house must go immediately into the committee of supply in which committee it was allowed that the production and examination of accounts would be quite proper and regular It was therefore carried that they should go into the committee without delay and without accounts in order to examine with great order and regularity things that could not possibly come before them After this stroke of orderly and parliamentary wit and humour they went into the committee and very generously voted the payment  THERE was a circumstance in that debate too remarkable to be overlooked This debt of the civil list was all along argued upon the same footing as a debt of the state contracted upon national authority Its payment was urged as equally pressing  upon the public faith and honour and when the whole year's account was stated in what is called  the Budget  the ministry valued themselves on the payment of so much public debt just as if they had discharged  l  of navy or exchequer bills Though in truth their payment from the sinking fund of debt which was never contracted by parliamentary authority was to all intents and purposes so much debt incurred But such is the present notion of public credit and payment of debt No wonder that it produces such effects  NOR was the house at all more attentive to a provident security against future than it had been to a vindictive retrospect to past mismanagements I should have thought indeed that a ministerial promise during their own continuance in office might have been given though this would have been but a poor security for the public Mr Pelham gave such an assurance and he kept his word But nothing was capable of extorting from our ministers any thing which had the least resemblance to a promise of confining the expences of the civil list within the limits which had been settled by parliament This reserve of theirs I look upon to be equivalent to the clearest declaration that they were resolved upon a contrary course  HOWEVER to put the matter beyond all doubt in the speech from the throne after thanking parliament for the relief so liberally granted the ministers inform the two houses that they will  endeavour  to confine the expences of the civil governmentwithin what limits think you those which the law had prescribed Not in the least  "such limits as the "  honour of the crown  can possibly admit"  THUS they established an  arbitrary  standard for that dignity which parliament had defined and limited  to a  legal  standard They gave themselves under the lax and indeterminate idea of the  honour of the crown  a full loose for all manner of dissipation and all manner of corruption This arbitrary standard they were not afraid to hold out to both houses while an idle and unoperative act of parliament estimating the dignity of the crown at  l  and confining it to that sum adds to the number of obsolete statutes which load the shelves of libraries without any sort of advantage to the people  AFTER this proceeding I suppose that no man can be so weak as to think that the crown is limited to any settled allowance whatsoever For if the ministry has  l  a year by the law of the land and if by the law of parliament all the debts which exceed it are to be paid previous to the production of any account I presume that this is equivalent to an income with no other limits than the abilities of the subject and the moderation of the court that is to say it is such an income as is possessed by every absolute monarch in Europe It amounts as a person of great ability said in the debate to an unlimited power of drawing upon the sinking fund Its effect on the public credit of this kingdom must be obvious for in vain is the sinking fund the great buttress of all the rest if it be in the power of the ministry to resort to it for the payment of any debts which they may choose to incur under the name of the civil list and through the medium of a committee which thinks itself obliged by law to vote supplies without any other account than that of the mere existence of the debt  FIVE hundred thousand pounds is a serious sum But it is nothing to the prolific principle upon which the sum was voted a principle that may be well called  the fruitful mother of an hundred more    Neither is the damage to public credit of very great consequence when compared with that which results to public morals and to the safety of the constitution from the exhaustless mine of corruption opened by the precedent and to be wrought by the principle of the late payment of the debts of the civil list The power of discretionary disqualification by one law of parliament and the necessity of paying every debt of the civil list by another law of parliament if suffered to pass unnoticed must establish such a fund of rewards and terrors as will make parliament the best appendage and support of arbitrary power that ever was invented by the wit of man This is felt The quarrel is begun between the representatives and the people The court faction have at length committed them  IN such a strait the wisest may well be perplexed and the boldest staggered The circumstances are in a great measure new We have hardly any landmarks from the wisdom of our ancestors to guide us At best we can only follow the spirit of their proceeding in other cases I know the diligence with which my observations on our public disorders have been made I am very sure of the integrity of the motives on which they are published I cannot be equally confident in any plan for the absolute cure of those disorders or for their certain future prevention My aim is to bring this matter into more public discussion Let the sagacity of others work upon it It is not uncommon for medical writers to describe histories of diseases very accurately on whose cure they can say but very little  THE first ideas which generally suggest themselves for the cure of parliamentary disorders are to shorten the duration of parliaments and to disqualify all or a great number of placemen from a  seat in the house of commons Whatever efficacy there may be in those remedies I am sure in the present state of things it is impossible to apply them A restoration of the right of free election is a preliminary indispensable to every other reformation What alterations ought afterwards to be made in constitution is a matter of deep and difficult research  IF I wrote merely to please the popular palate it would indeed be as little troublesome to me as to another to extol these remedies so famous in speculation but to which their greatest admirers have never attempted seriously to resort in practice I confess then that I have no sort of reliance upon either a triennial parliament or a placebill With regard to the former perhaps it might rather serve to counteract than to promote the ends that are proposed by it To say nothing of the horrible disorders among the people attending frequent elections I should be fearful of committing every three years the independent gentlemen of the country into a contest with the treasury It is easy to see which of the contending parties would be ruined first Whoever has taken a careful view of public proceedings so as to endeavour to ground his speculations on his experience must have observed how prodigiously greater the power of ministry is in the first and last session of a parliament than it is in the intermediate period when members sit a little firm on their seats The persons of the greatest parliamentary experience with whom I have conversed did constantly in canvassing the fate of questions allow something to the courtside upon account of the elections depending or imminent The evil complained of if it exists in the present state of things would hardly be removed by a triennial parliament for unless the influence of government  in elections can be entirely taken away the more frequently they return the more they will harass private independence the more generally men will be compelled to fly to the settled systematic interest of government and to the resources of a boundless civil list Certainly something may be done and ought to be done towards lessening that influence in elections and this will be necessary upon a plan either of longer or shorter duration of parliament But nothing can so perfectly remove the evil as not to render such contentions too frequently repeated utterly ruinous first to independence of fortune and then to independence of spirit As I am only giving an opinion on this point and not at all debating it in an adverse line I hope I may be excused in another observation With great truth I may aver that I never remember to have talked on this subject with any man much conversant with public business who considered short parliaments as a real improvement of the constitution Gentlemen warm in a popular cause are ready enough to attribute all the declarations of such persons to corrupt motives But the habit of affairs if on one hand it tends to corrupt the mind furnishes it on the other with the means of better information The authority of such persons will always have some weight It may stand upon a par with the speculations of those who are less practised in business and who with perhaps purer intentions have not so effectual means of judging It is besides an effect of vulgar and puerile malignity to imagine that every statesman is of course corrupt and that his opinion upon every constitutional point is solely formed upon some sinister interest  THE next favourite remedy is a placebill The same principle guides in both I mean the opinion  which is entertained by many of the infallibility of laws and regulations in the cure of public distempers Without being as unreasonably doubtful as many are unwisely confident I will only say that this also is a matter very well worthy of serious and mature reflection It is not easy to foresee what the effect would be of disconnecting with parliament the greatest part of those who hold civil employments and of such mighty and important bodies as the military and naval establishments It were better perhaps that they should have a corrupt interest in the forms of the constitution than that they should have none at all This is a question altogether different from the disqualification of a particular description of revenue officers from seats in parliament or perhaps of all the lower sorts of them from votes in elections In the former case only the few are affected in the latter only the inconsiderable But a great official a great professional a great military and naval interest all necessarily comprehending many people of the first weight ability wealth and spirit has been gradually formed in the kingdom These new interests must be let into a share of representation else possibly they may be inclined to destroy those institutions of which they are not permitted to partake This is not a thing to be trifled with nor is it every wellmeaning man that is fit to put his hands to it Many other serious considerations occur I do not open them here because they are not directly to my purpose proposing only to give the reader some taste of the difficulties that attend all capital changes in the constitution just to hint the uncertainty to say no worse of being able to prevent the court as long as it has the means of influence abundantly in its power of applying that influence to parliament and perhaps if the public method were precluded of doing it in some worse  and more dangerous method Underhand and oblique ways would be studied The science of evasion already tolerably understood would then be brought to the greatest perfection It is no inconsiderable part of wisdom to know how much of an evil ought to be tolerated lest by attempting a degree of purity impracticable in degenerate times and manners instead of cutting of the subsisting ill practices new corruptions might be produced for the concealment and security of the old It were better undoubtedly that no influence at all could affect the mind of a member of parliament But of all modes of influence in my opinion a place under the government is the least disgraceful to the man who holds it and by far the most safe to the country I would not shut out that sort of influence which is open and visible which is connected with the dignity and the service of the state when it is not in my power to prevent the influence of contracts of subscriptions of direct bribery and those innumerable methods of clandestine corruption which are abundantly in the hands of the court and which will be applied as long as these means of corruption and the disposition to be corrupted have existence amongst us Our constitution stands on a nice equipoise with steep precipices and deep waters upon all sides of it In removing it from a dangerous leaning towards one side there may be a risque of oversetting it on the other Every project of a material change in a government so complicated as ours combined at the same time with external circumstances still more complicated is a matter full of difficulties in which a considerate man will not be too ready to decide a prudent man too ready to undertake or an honest man too ready to promise They do not respect the public nor themselves who engage for more than they are sure that they  ought to attempt or that they are able to perform These are my sentiments weak perhaps but honest and unbiassed and submitted entirely to the opinion of grave men well affected to the constitution of their country and of experience in what may best promote or hurt it  INDEED in the situation in which we stand with an immense revenue an enormous debt mighty establishments government itself a great banker and a great merchant I see no other way for the preservation of a decent attention to public interest in the representatives but  the interposition of the body of the people itself  whenever it shall appear by some flagrant and notorious act by some capital innovation that these representatives are going to overleap the fences of the law and to introduce an arbitrary power This interposition is a most unpleasant remedy But if it be a legal remedy it is intended on some occasion to be used to be used then only when it is evident that nothing else can hold the constitution to its true principles  THE distempers of monarchy were the great subjects of apprehension and redress in the last century in this the distempers of parliament It is not in parliament alone that the remedy for parliamentary disorders can be compleated hardly indeed can it begin there Until a confidence in government is reestablished the people ought to be excited to a more strict and detailed attention to the conduct of their representatives Standards for judging more systematically upon their conduct ought to be settled in the meetings of counties and corporations Frequent and correct lists of the voters in all important questions ought to be procured  BY such means something may be done By such means it may appear who those are that by an indiscriminate support of all administrations have totally banished all integrity and confidence out of public proceedings have confounded the best men with the worst and weakened and dissolved instead of strengthening and compacting the general frame of government If any person is more concerned for government and order than for the liberties of his country even he is equally concerned to put an end to this course of indiscriminate support It is this blind and undistinguishing support that feeds the spring of those very disorders by which he is frighted into the arms of the faction which contains in itself the source of all disorders by enfeebling all the visible and regular authority of the state The distemper is increased by his injudicious and preposterous endeavours or pretences for the cure of it  AN exterior administration chosen for its impotency or after it is chosen purposely rendered impotent in order to be rendered subservient will not be obeyed The laws themselves will not be respected when those who execute them are despised and they will be despised when their power is not immediate from the crown or natural in the kingdom Never were ministers better supported in parliament Parliamentary support comes and goes with office totally regardless of the man or the merit Is government strengthened It grows weaker and weaker The popular torrent gains upon it every hour Let us learn from our experience It is not support that is wanting to government but reformation When ministry rests upon public opinion it is not indeed built upon a rock of adamant it has however some stability But when it stands upon private humour its structure  is of stubble and its foundation is on quicksand I repeat it againHe that supports every administration subverts all government The reason is this The whole business in which a court usually takes an interest goes on at present equally well in whatever hands whether high or low wise or foolish scandalous or reputable there is nothing therefore to hold it firm to any one body of men or to any one consistent scheme of politics Nothing interposes to prevent the full operation of all the caprices and all the passions of a court upon the servants of the public The system of administration is open to continual shocks and changes upon the principles of the meanest cabal and the most contemptible intrigue Nothing can be solid and permanent All good men at length fly with horrour from such a service Men of rank and ability with the spirit which ought to animate such men in a free state while they decline the jurisdiction of a dark cabal on their actions and their fortunes will for both chearfully put themselves upon their country They will trust an inquisitive and distinguishing parliament because it does enquire and does distinguish If they act well they know that in such a parliament they will be supported against any intrigue if they act ill they know that no intrigue can protect them This situation however aweful is honourable But in one hour and in the selfsame assembly without any assigned or assignable cause to be precipitated from the highest authority to the most marked neglect possibly into the greatest peril of life and reputation is a situation full of danger and destitute of honour It will be shunned equally by every man of prudence and every man of spirit  SUCH are the consequences of the division of court from the administration and of the division  of public men among themselves By the former of these lawful government is undone by the latter all opposition to lawless power is rendered impotent Government may in a great measure be restored if any considerable bodies of men have honesty and resolution enough never to accept administration unless this garrison of  king's men  which is stationed as in a citadel to controul and enslave it be entirely broken and disbanded and every work they have thrown up be levelled with the ground The disposition of public men to keep this corps together and to act under it or to cooperate with it is a touchstone by which every administration ought in future to be tried There has not been one which has not sufficiently experienced the utter incompatibility of that faction with the public peace and with all the ends of good government since if they opposed it they soon lost every power of serving the crown if they submitted to it they lost all the esteem of their country Until ministers give to the public a full proof of their entire alienation from that system however plausible their pretences we may be sure they are more intent on the emoluments than the duties of office If they refuse to give this proof we know of what stuff they are made In this particular it ought to be the electors business to look to their representatives The electors ought to esteem it no less culpable in their member to give a single vote in parliament to such an administration than to take an office under it to endure it than to act in it The notorious infidelity and versatility of members of parliament in their opinions of men and things ought in a particular manner to be considered by the electors in the enquiry which is recommended to them This is one of the principal holdings of that destructive system which has endeavoured to unhinge all the  virtuous honourable and useful connexions in the kingdom  THIS cabal has with great success propagated a doctrine which serves for a colour to those acts of treachery and whilst it receives any degree of countenance it will be utterly senseless to look for a vigorous opposition to the court party The doctrine is this That all political connexions are in their nature factious and as such ought to be dissipated and destroyed and that the rule for forming administrations is mere personal ability rated by the judgment of this cabal upon it and taken by draughts from every division and denomination of public men This decree was solemnly promulgated by the head of the court corps the earl of Bute himself in a speech which he made in the year against the then administration the only administration which he has ever been known directly and publicly to oppose  IT is indeed in no way wonderful that such persons should make such declarations That connexion and faction are equivalent terms is an opinion which has been carefully inculcated at all times by unconstitutional statesmen The reason is evident Whilst men are linked together they easily and spedily communicate the alarm of any evil design They are enabled to fathom it with common counsel and to oppose it with united strength Whereas when they lie dispersed without concert order or discipline communication is uncertain counsel difficult and resistance impracticable Where men are not acquainted with each other's principles nor experienced in each other's talents nor at all practised in their mutual habitudes and dispositions by joint efforts in business no personal confidence no friendship no common interest subsisting among them it is  evidently impossible that they can act a public part with uniformity perseverance or efficacy In a connexion the most inconsiderable man by adding to the weight of the whole has his value and his use out of it the greatest talents are wholly unserviceable to the public No man who is not inflamed by vainglory into enthusiasm can flatter himself that his single unsupported desultory unsystematic endeavours are of power to defeat the subtle designs and united cabals of ambitious citizens When bad men combine the good must associate else they will fall one by one an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle  IT is not enough in a situation of trust in the commonwealth that a man means well to his country it is not enough that in his single person he never did an evil act but always voted according to his conscience and even harangued against every design which he apprehended to be prejudicial to the interests of his country This innoxious and ineffectual character that seems formed upon a plan of apology and disculpation falls miserably short of the mark of public duty That duty demands and requires that what is right should not only be made known but made prevalent that what is evil should not only be detected but defeated When the public man omits to put himself in a situation of doing his duty with effect it is an omission that frustrates the purposes of his trust almost as much as if he had formally betrayed it It is surely no very rational account of a man's life that he has always acted right but has taken special care to act in such a manner that his endeavours could not possibly be productive of any consequence  I DO not wonder that the behaviour of many parties should have made persons of tender and scrupulous  virtue somewhat out of humour with all sorts of connexion in politics I admit that people frequently acquire in such confederacies a narrow bigoted and proscriptive spirit that they are apt to sink the idea of the general good in this circumscribed and partial interest But where duty renders a critical situation a necessary one it is our business to keep free from the evils attendant upon it and not to fly from the situation itself If a fortress is seated in an unwholesome air an officer of the garrison is obliged to be attentive to his health but he must not desert his station Every profession not excepting the glorious one of a soldier or the sacred one of a priest is liable to its own particular vices which however form no argument against those ways of life nor are the vices themselves inevitable to every individual in those professions Of such a nature are connexions in politics essentially necessary for the full performance of our public duty accidentally liable to degenerate into faction Commonwealths are made of families free commonwealths of parties also and we may as well affirm that our natural regards and ties of blood tend inevitably to make men bad citizens as that the bonds of our party weaken those by which we are held to our country  SOME legislators went so far as to make neutrality in party a crime against the state I do not know whether this might not have been rather to overstrain the principle Certain it is the best patriots in the greatest commonwealths have always commended and promoted such connexions  Idem sentire de republica  was with them a principal ground of friendship and attachment nor do I know any other capable of forming firmer dearer more pleasing more honourable and more virtuous habitudes The Romans carried this principle a great  way Even the holding of offices together the disposition of which arose from chance not selection gave rise to a relation which continued for life It was called  necessitudo sortis  and it was looked upon with a sacred reverence Breaches of any of these kinds of civil relation were considered as acts of the most distinguished turpitude The whole people was distributed into political societies in which they acted in support of such interests in the state as they severally affected For it was then thought no crime to endeavour by every honest means to advance to superiority and power those of your own sentiments and opinions This wise people was far from imagining that those connexions had no tie and obliged to no duty but that men might quit them without shame upon every call of interest They believed private honour to be the great foundation of public trust that friendship was no mean step towards patriotism that he who in the common intercourse of life shewed he regarded somebody besides himself when he came to act in a public situation might probably consult some other interest than his own Never may we become  plus sages que les sages  as the French comedian has happily expressed it wiser than all the wise and good men who have lived before us It was their wish to see public and private virtues not dissonant and jarring and mutually destructive but harmoniously combined growing out of one another in a noble and orderly gradation reciprocally supporting and supported In one of the most fortunate periods of our history this country was governed by a  connexion  I mean the great connexion of whigs in the reign of queen Anne They were complimented upon the principle of this connexion by a poet who was in high esteem with them Addison who knew their sentiments could not praise them for what they considered as no proper subject of commendation  As a poet who knew his business he could not applaud them for a thing which in general estimation was not highly reputable Addressing himself to Britain  Thy fav'rites grow not up by fortunes sport  Or from the crimes or follies of a court  On the firm basis of desert they rise  From longtry'd faith and friendship's holy ties  THE whigs of those days believed that the only proper method of rising into power was through hard essays of practised friendship and experimented fidelity At that time it was not imagined that patriotism was a bloody idol which required the sacrifice of children and parents or dearest connexions in private life and of all the virtues that rise from those relations They were not of that ingenious paradoxical morality to imagine that a spirit of moderation was properly shewn in patiently bearing the sufferings of your friends or that disinterestedness was clearly manifested at the expence of other peoples fortune They believed that no men could act with effect who did not act in concert that no men could act in concert who did not act with confidence and that no men could act with confidence who were not bound together by common opinions common affections and common interests  THESE wise men for such I must call lord Sunderland lord Godolphin lord Sommers and lord Marlborough were too well principled in these maxims upon which the whole fabric of public strength is built to be blown off their ground by the breath of every childish talker They were not afraid that they should be called an ambitious Junto or that their resolution to stand or fall together  should by placemen be interpreted into a scuffle for places  PARTY is a body of men united for promoting by their joint endeavours the national interest upon some particular principle in which they are all agreed For my part I find it impossible to conceive that any one believes in his own politics or thinks them to be of any weight who refuses to adopt the means of having them reduced into practice It is the business of the speculative philosopher to mark the proper ends of government It is the business of the politician who is the philosopher in action to find out proper means towards those ends and to employ them with effect Therefore every honourable connexion will avow it is their first purpose to pursue every just method to put the men who hold their opinions into such a condition as may enable them to carry their common plans into execution with all the power and authority of the state As this power is attached to certain situations it is their duty to contend for these situations Without a proscription of others they are bound to give to their own party the preference in all things and by no means for private considerations to accept any offers of power in which the whole body is not included nor to suffer themselves to be led or to be controuled or to be overbalanced in office or in council by those who contradict the very fundamental principles on which their party is formed and even those upon which every fair connexion must stand Such a generous contention for power on such manly and honourable maxims will easily be distinguished from the mean and interested struggle for place and emolument The very stile of such persons will serve to discriminate them from those numberless impostors who have deluded the ignorant with professions incompatible  with human practice and have afterwards incensed them by practices below the level of vulgar rectitude  IT is an advantage to all narrow wisdom and narrow morals that their maxims have a plausible air and on a cursory view appear equal to first principles They are light and portable They are as current as copper coin and about as valuable They serve equally the first capacities and the lowest and they are at least as useful to the worst men as the best Of this stamp is the cant of  Not men but measures  a sort of charm by which many people get loose from every honourable engagement When I see a man acting this desultory and disconnected part with as much detriment to his own fortune as prejudice to the cause of any party I am not persuaded that he is right but I am ready to believe he is in earnest I respect virtue in all its situations even when it is found in the unsuitable company of weakness I lament to see qualities rare and valuable squandered away without any public utility But when a gentleman with great visible emoluments abandons the party in which he has long acted and tells you it is because he proceeds upon his own judgment that he acts on the merits of the several measures as they arise and that he is obliged to follow his own conscience and not that of others he gives reasons which it is impossible to controvert and discovers a character which it is impossible to mistake What shall we think of him who never differed from a certain set of men until the moment they lost their power and who never agreed with them in a single instance afterwards Would not such a coincidence of interest and opinion be rather fortunate Would it not be an extraordinary cast upon the dice that a man's connexions should degenerate into faction  precisely at the critical moment when they lose their power or he accepts a place When people desert their connexions the desertion is a manifest  fact  upon which a direct simple issue lies triable by plain men Whether a  measure  of government be right or wrong is  no matter of fact  but a mere affair of opinion on which men may as they do dispute and wrangle without end But whether the individual  thinks  the measure right or wrong is a point at still a greater distance from the reach of all human decision It is therefore very convenient to politicians not to put the judgment of their conduct on overtacts cognizable in any ordinary court but upon such matter as can be triable only in that secret tribunal where they are sure of being heard with favour or where at worst the sentence will be only private whipping  I BELIEVE the reader would wish to find no substance in a doctrine which has a tendency to destroy all test of character as deduced from conduct He will therefore excuse my adding something more towards the further clearing up a point which the great convenience of obscurity to dishonesty has been able to cover with some degree of darkness and doubt  IN order to throw an odium on political connexion these politicians suppose it a necessary incident to it that you are blindly to follow the opinions of your party when in direct opposition to your own clear ideas a degree of servitude that no worthy man could bear the thought of submitting to and such as I believe no connexions except some court factions ever could be so senselessly tyrannical as to impose Men thinking freely will in particular instances think differently But still as the greater part of the measures which arise in the course of public business are related to  or dependent on some great  leading general principles in government  a man must be peculiarly unfortunate in the choice of his political company if he does not agree with them at least nine times in ten If he does not concur in these general principles upon which the party is founded and which necessarily draw on a concurrence in their application he ought from the beginning to have chosen some other more conformable to his opinions When the question is in its nature doubtful or not very material the modesty which becomes an individual and in spite of our court moralists that partiality which becomes a wellchosen friendship will frequently bring on an acquiescence in the general sentiment Thus the disagreement will naturally be rare it will be only enough to indulge freedom without violating concord or disturbing arrangement And this is all that ever was required for a character of the greatest uniformity and steadiness in connexion How men can proceed without any connexion at all is to me utterly incomprehensible Of what sort of materials must that man be made how must he be tempered and put together who can sit whole years in parliament with five hundred and fifty of his fellow citizens amidst the storm of such tempestuous passions in the sharp conflict of so many wits and tempers and characters in the agitation of such mighty questions in the discussion of such vast and ponderous interests without seeing any one sort of men whose character conduct or disposition would lead him to associate himself with them to aid and be aided in any one system of public utility  I REMEMBER an old scholastic aphorism which says  "that the man who lives wholly detached from others must be either an angel or a devil"  When I see in any of these detached gentlemen of our times the angelic purity power and beneficence I shall admit them to be angels In the mean time we are born only to be men We shall do enough if we form ourselves to be good ones It is therefore our business carefully to cultivate in our minds to rear to the most perfect vigour and maturity every sort of generous and honest feeling that belongs to our nature To bring the dispositions that are lovely in private life into the service and conduct of the commonwealth so to be patriots as not to forget we are gentlemen To cultivate friendships and to incur enmities To have both strong but both selected in the one to be placable in the other immovable To model our principles to our duties and our situation To be fully persuaded that all virtue which is impracticable is spurious and rather to run the risque of falling into faults in a course which leads us to act with effect and energy than to loiter out our days without blame and without use Public life is a situation of power and energy he trespasses against his duty who sleeps upon his watch as well as he that goes over to the enemy  THERE is however a time for all things It is not every conjuncture which calls with equal force upon the activity of honest men but critical exigencies now and then arise and I am mistaken if this be not one of them Men will see the necessity of honest combination but they may see it when it is too late They may embody when it will be ruinous to themselves and of no advantage to the country when for want of such a timely union as may enable them to oppose in favour of the laws with the laws on their side they may at length find themselves under the necessity of conspiring  instead of consulting The law for which they stand may become a weapon in the hands of its bitterest enemies and they will be cast at length into that miserable alternative between slavery and civil confusion which no good man can look upon without horrour an alternative in which it is impossible he should take either part with a conscience perfectly at repose To keep that situation of guilt and remorse at the utmost distance is therefore our first obligation Early activity may prevent late and fruitless violence As yet we work in the light The scheme of the enemies of public tranquillity has disarranged it has not destroyed us  IF the reader believes that there really exists such a faction as I have described a faction ruling by the private inclinations of a court against the general sense of the people and that this faction whilst it pursues a scheme for undermining all the foundations of our freedom weakens for the present at least all the powers of executory government rendering us abroad contemptible and at home distracted he will believe also that nothing but a firm combination of public men against this body and that too supported by the hearty concurrence of the people at large can possibly get the better of it The people will see the necessity of restoring public men to an attention to the public opinion and of restoring the constitution to its original principles Above all they will endeavour to keep the house of commons from assuming a character which does not belong to it They will endeavour to keep that house for its existence for its powers and its privileges as independent of every other and as dependent upon themselves as possible This servitude is to an house of commons  like obedience to the Divine law  "perfect freedom"  For if they once quit this natural rational and liberal obedience having deserted the only proper foundation of their power they must seek a support in an abject and unnatural dependence somewhere else When through the medium of this just connexion with their constituents the genuine dignity of the house of commons is restored it will begin to think of casting from it with scorn as badges of servility all the false ornaments of illegal power with which it has been for sometime disgraced It will begin to think of its old office of CONTROUL It will not suffer that last of evils to predominate in the country men without popular confidence public opinion natural connexion or mutual trust invested with all the powers of government  WHEN they have learned this lesson themselves they will be willing and able to teach the court that it is the true interest of the prince to have but one administration and that one composed of those who recommend themselves to their sovereign through the opinion of their country and not by their obsequiousness to a favourite Such men will serve their sovereign with affection and fidelity because his choice of them upon such principles is a compliment to their virtue They will be able to serve him effectually because they will add the weight of the country to the force of the executory power They will be able to serve their king with dignity because they will never abuse his name to the gratification of their private spleen or avarice This with allowances for human frailty may probably be the general character of a ministry which  thinks itself accountable to the house of commons when the house of commons thinks itself accountable to its constituents If other ideas should prevail things must remain in their present confusion until they are hurried into all the rage of civil violence or until they sink into the dead repose of despotism  SPEECH ON AMERICAN TAXATION APRIL  PREFACE  THE following speech has been much the subject of conversation and the desire of having it printed was last summer very general The means of gratifying the public curiosity were obligingly furnished from the notes of some gentlemen members of the last parliament  THIS piece has been for some months ready for the press But a delicacy possibly overscrupulous has delayed the publication to this time The friends of administration have been use to attribute a great deal of the opposition to their measures in America to the writings published in England The Editor of this speech kept it back until all the measures of government have had their full operation and can be no longer affected if ever they could have been affected by any publication  MOST readers will recollect the uncommon pains taken at the beginning of the last session of the last parliament and indeed during the whole course of it to asperse the characters and decry the measures of those who were supposed to be friends to America  in order to weaken the effect of their opposition to the acts of rigour then preparing against the colonies This speech contains a full refutation of the charges against that party with which Mr Burke has all along acted In doing this he has taken a review of the effects of all the schemes which have been successively adopted in the government of the plantations The subject is interesting the matters of information various and important and the publication at this time the editor hopes will not be thought unseasonable  SPEECH ON AMERICAN TAXATION  DURING the last session of the last parliament on the th of April Mr Rose Fuller member for Rye made the following motion that an act made in the seventh year of the reign of his present Majesty intituled  "An act for granting certain duties in the British colonies and plantations in America for allowing a drawback of the duties of customs upon the exportation from this kingdom of Coffee and Cocoa Nuts of the produce of the said colonies or plantations for discontinuing the drawbacks payable on China Earthen Ware exported to America and for more effectually preventing the clandestine running of goods in the said colonies and plantations"  might be read  AND the same being read accordingly he moved  "That this house will upon this day sevennight resolve itself into a committee of the whole house to take into consideration the duty of  d per  pound weight upon tea payable in all his Majesty's dominions in America imposed by the said act and also the appropriation of the said duty"  ON this latter motion a warm and interesting debate arose in which Mr Edmund Burke spoke as follows  SIR  I AGREE with the honourable gentleman  Charles Wolfran Cornwall  Esq  lately appointed one of the Lords of the Treasury  who spoke last that this subject is not new in this house Very disagreeably to this house very unfortunately to this nation and to the peace and prosperity of this whole empire no topic has been more familiar to us For nine long years session after session we have been lashed round and round this miserable circle of occasional arguments and temporary expedients I am sure our heads must turn and our stomachs nauseate with them We have had them in every shape we have looked at them in every point of view Invention is exhausted reason is fatigued experience has given judgment but obstinacy is not yet conquered  THE hon gentleman has made one endeavour more to diversity the form of this disgusting argument He has thrown out a speech composed almost entirely of challenges Challenges are serious things and as he is a man of prudence as well as resolution I dare say he has very well weighed those challenges before he delivered them I had long the happiness to sit at the same side of the house and to agree with the hon gentleman on all the American questions My sentiments I am sure are well known to him and I thought I had been perfectly acquainted with his Though I find myself mistaken he will still permit me to use the privilege of an old friendship he will permit me to apply myself to the house under the sanction of his authority and on the various grounds he has measured out to submit to you the poor opinions which I have formed upon a matter of importance enough to demand the fullest consideration I could bestow upon it  He has stated to the house two grounds of deliberation one narrow and simple and merely confined to the question on your paper the other more large and more complicated comprehending the whole series of the parliamentary proceedings with regard to America their causes and their consequences With regard to the latter ground he states it as useless and thinks it may be even dangerous to enter into so extensive a field of enquiry Yet to my surprize he had hardly laid down this restrictive proposition to which his authority would have given so much weight when directly and with the same authority he condemns it and declares it absolutely necessary to enter into the most ample historical detail His zeal has thrown him a little out of his usual accuracy In this perplexity what shall we do sir who are willing to submit to the law he gives us He has reprobated in one part of his speech the rule he had laid down for debate in the other and after narrowing the ground for all those who are to speak after him he takes an excursion himself as unbounded as the subject and the extent of his great abilities  SIR when I cannot obey all his laws I will do the best I can I will endeavour to obey such of them as have the sanction of his example and to stick to that rule which though not consistent with the other is the most rational He was certainly in the right when he took the matter largely I cannot prevail on myself to agree with him in his censure of his own conduct It is not he will give me leave to say either useless or dangerous He asserts that retrospect is not wise and the proper the only proper subject of enquiry is  "not how we got into this difficulty but how we are to get out of it"  In other words we are according to him to consult our invention and to reject our  experience The mode of deliberation he recommends is diametrically opposite to every rule of reason and every principle of good sense established amongst mankind For that sense and that reason I have always understood absolutely to prescribe whenever we are involved in difficulties from the measures we have pursued that we should take a strict review of those measures in order to correct our errors if they should be corrigible or at least to avoid a dull uniformity in mischief and the unpitied calamity of being repeatedly caught in the same snare  SIR I will freely follow the hon gentleman in his historical discussion without the least management for men or measures further than as they shall seem to me to deserve it But before I go into that large consideration because I would omit nothing that can give the house satisfaction I wish to tread the narrow ground to which alone the hon gentleman in one part of his speech has so strictly confined us  HE desires to know whether if we were to repeal this tax agreeably to the proposition of the hon gentleman who made the motion the Americans would not take post on this concession in order to make a new attack on the next body of taxes and whether they would not call for a repeal of the duty on wine as loudly as they do now for the repeal of the duty on tea Sir I can give no security on this subject But I will do all that I can and all that can be fairly demanded To the  experience  which the hon gentleman reprobates in one instant and reverts to in the next to that experience without the least wavering or hesitation on my part I steadily appeal and would to God there was no other arbiter to decide on the vote with which the house is to conclude this day  WHEN parliament repealed the stamp act in the year I affirm first that the Americans did  not  in consequence of this measure call upon you to give up the former parliamentary revenue which subsisted in that country or even any one of the articles which compose it I affirm also that when departing from the maxims of that repeal you revived the scheme of taxation and thereby filled the minds of the colonists with new jealousy and all sorts of apprehensions then it was that they quarrelled with the old taxes as well as the new then it was and not till then that they questioned all the parts of your legislative power and by the battery of such questions have shaken the solid structure of this Empire to its deepest foundations  ON those two propositions I shall before I have done give such convincing such damning proof that however the contrary may be whispered in circles or bawled in newspapers they never more will dare to raise their voices in this house I speak with great confidence I have reason for it The ministers are with me  They  at least are convinced that the repeal of the stamp act had not and that no repeal can have the consequences which the hon gentleman who defends their measures is so much alarmed at To their conduct I refer him for a conclusive answer to his objection I carry my proof irresistibly into the very body of both ministry and parliament not on any general reasoning growing out of collateral matter but on the conduct of the hon gentleman's ministerial friends on the new revenue itself  THE act of which grants this tea duty sets forth in its preamble that it was expedient to raise a revenue in America for the support of the civil government there as well as for purposes still more extensive To this support the act assigns  six branches of duties About two years after this act passed the ministry I mean the present ministry thought it expedient to repeal five of the duties and to leave for reasons best known to themselves only the sixth standing Suppose any person at the time of that repeal had thus addressed the minister  Lord North then chancellor of the Exchequer    "Condemning as you do the repeal of the stamp act why do you venture to repeal the duties upon glass paper and painters colours Let your pretence for the repeal be what it will are not you thoroughly convinced that your concessions will produce not satisfaction but insolence in the Americans and that the giving up these taxes will necessitate the giving up of all the rest"  This objection was as palpable then as it is now and it was as good for preserving the five duties as for retaining the sixth Besides the minister will recollect that the repeal of the stamp act had but just preceded his repeal and the ill policy of that measure had it been so impolitic as it has been represented and the mischiefs it produced were quite recent Upon the principles therefore of the hon gentleman upon the principles of the minister himself the minister has nothing at all to answer He stands condemned by himself and by all his associates old and new as a destroyer in the first trust of finance of the revenues and in the first rank of honour as a betrayer of the dignity of his country  MOST men especially great men do not always know their wellwishers I come to rescue that noble lord out of the hands of those he calls his friends and even out of his own I will do him the justice he is denied at home He has not been this wicked or imprudent man He knew that a repeal had no tendency to produce the mischiefs  which give so much alarm to his honourable friend His work was not bad in its principle but imperfect in its execution and the motion on your paper presses him only to compleat a proper plan which by some unfortunate and unaccountable error he had left unfinished  I HOPE sir the hon gentleman who spoke last is thoroughly satisfied and satisfied out of the proceedings of ministry on their own favourite act that his fears from a repeal are groundless If he is not I leave him and the noble lord who sits by him to settle the matter as well as they can together for if the repeal of American taxes destroys all our government in AmericaHe is the manand he is the worst of all the repealers because he is the last  BUT I hear it rung continually in my ears now and formerly  "The preamble what will become of the preamble if you repeal this tax"  I am sorry to be compelled so often to expose the calamities and disgraces of parliament The preamble of this law standing as it now stands has the lie direct given to it by the provisionary part of the act if that can be called provisionary which makes no provision I should be afraid to express myself in this manner especially in the face of such a formidable array of ability as is now drawn up before me composed of the antient household troops of that side of the house and the new recruits from this if the matter were not clear and indisputable Nothing but truth could give me this firmness but plain truth and clear evidence can be beat down by no ability The clerk will be so good as to turn to the act and to read this favourite preamble  WHEREAS it is  expedient  that a revenue should be raised in your Majesty's dominions in America for  making a more  certain  and  adequate  provision for defraying the charge of the  administration of justice and support of civil government  in such provinces where it shall be found necessary and towards  further defraying  the expences of  defending protecting and securing the said dominions  YOU have heard this pompous performance Now where is the revenue which is to do all these mighty things Fivesixths repealedabandonedsunkgonelost for ever Does the poor solitary tea duty support the purposes of this preamble Is not the supply there stated as effectually abandoned as if the tea duty had perished in the general wreck Here Mr Speaker is a precious mockerya preamble without an acttaxes granted in order to be repealedand the reasons of the grant still carefully kept up This is raising a revenue in America This is preserving dignity in England If you repeal this tax in compliance with the motion I readily admit that you lose this fair preamble Estimate your loss in it The object of the act is gone already and all you suffer is the purging the Statutebook of the opprobrium of an empty absurd and false recital  IT has been said again and again that the five taxes were repealed on commercial principles It is so said in the paper in my hand  Lord Hilsborough's circular letter to the governors of the colonies concerning the repeal of some of the duties laid in the act of  a paper which I constantly carry about which I have often used and shall often use again What is got by this paltry pretence of commercial principles I know not for if your government in America is destroyed by the  repeal of taxes  it is of no consequence upon what ideas the repeal is grounded Repeal this tax too upon commercial principles if you  please These principles will serve as well now as they did formerly But you know that either your objection to a repeal from these supposed consequences has no validity or that this pretence never could remove it This commercial motive never was believed by any man either in America which this letter is meant to soothe or in England which it is meant to deceive It was impossible it should Because every man in the least acquainted with the detail of commerce must know that several of the articles on which the tax was repealed were fitter objects of duties than almost any other articles that could possibly be chosen without comparison more so than the Tea that was left taxed as infinitely less liable to be eluded by contraband The tax upon red and white Lead was of this nature You have in this kingdom an advantage in Lead that amounts to a monopoly When you find yourself in this situation of advantage you sometimes venture to tax even your own export You did so soon after the last war when upon this principle you ventured to impose a duty on coals In all the articles of American contraband trade who ever heard of the smuggling of red lead and white lead You might therefore well enough without danger of contraband and without injury to commerce if this were the whole consideration have taxed these commodities The same may be said of Glass Besides some of the things taxed were so trivial that the loss of the objects themselves and their utter annihilation out of American commerce would have been comparatively as nothing But is the article of Tea such an object in the trade of England as not to be felt or felt but slightly like white Lead and red Lead and Painters colours Tea is an object of far other importance Tea is perhaps the most important object taking it with  its necessary connections of any in the mighty circle of our commerce If commercial principles had been the true motives to the repeal or had they been at all attended to Tea would have been the last article we should have left taxed for a subject of controversy  SIR it is not a pleasant consideration but nothing in the world can read so awful and so instructive a lesson as the conduct of ministry in this business upon the mischief of not having large and liberal ideas in the management of great affairs Never have the servants of the state looked at the whole of your complicated interests in one connected view They have taken things by bits and scraps some at one time and one pretence and some at another just as they pressed without any sort of regard to their relations or dependencies They never had any kind of system right or wrong but only invented occasionally some miserable tale for the day in order meanly to sneak out of difficulties into which they had proudly strutted And they were put to all these shifts and devices full of meanness and full of mischief in order to pilser piecemeal a repeal of an act which they had not the generous courage when they found and felt their error honourably and fairly to disclaim By such management by the irresistible operation of sceble councils so paltry a sum as threepence in the eyes of a financier so insignificant an article as tea in the eyes of a philosopher have shaken the pillars of a commercial empire that circled the whole globe  Do you forget that in the very last year you stood on the precipice of general bankruptcy Your danger was indeed great You were distressed in the affairs of the East India company and you well know what sort of things are involved in the comprehensive energy of that significant apellation  I am not called upon to enlarge to you on that danger which you thought proper yourselves to aggravate and to display to the world with all the parade of indiscreet declamation The monopoly of the most lucrative trades and the possession of imperial revenues had brought you to the verge of beggary and ruin Such was your representationsuch in some measure was your case The vent of ten millions of pounds of this commodity now locked up by the operation of an injudicious tax and rotting in the warehouses of the company would have prevented all this distress and all that series of desperate measures which you thought yourselves obliged to take in consequence of it America would have furnished that vent which no other part of the world can furnish but America where Tea is next to a necessary of life and where the demand grows upon the supply I hope our dearbought East India committees have done us at least so much good as to let us know that without a more extensive sale of that article our East India revenues and acquisitions can have no certain connection with this country It is through the American trade of tea that your East India conquests are to be prevented from crushing you with their burthen They are ponderous indeed and they must have that great country to lean upon or they tumble upon your head It is the same folly that has lost you at once the benefit of the West and of the East This folly has thrown open foldingdoors to contraband and will be the means of giving the profits of the trade of your colonies to every nation but yourselves Never did a people suffer so much for the empty words of a preamble It must be given up For on what principle does it stand This famous revenue stands at this hour on all the debate as a description of revenue not as yet known in all the comprehensive but too comprehensive vocabulary of finance  a preambulary tax  It is indeed a  tax of sophistry a tax of pedantry a tax of disputation a tax of war and rebellion a tax for any thing but benefit to the imposers or satisfaction to the subject  WELL but whatever it is gentlemen will force the colonists to take the Teas You will force them has seven years struggle been yet able to force them Oh but it seems  "we are in the rightThe tax is triflingin effect it is rather an exoneration than an imposition threefourths of the duty formerly payable on Teas exported to America is taken off the place of collection is only shifted instead of the retention of a shilling from the drawback here it is threepence custom paid in America"  All this sir is very true But this is the very folly and mischief of the act Incredible as it may seem you know that you have deliberately thrown away a large duty which you held secure and quiet in your hands for the vain hope of getting one threefourths less through every hazard through certain litigation and possibly through war  THE manner of proceeding in the duties on paper and glass imposed by the same act was exactly in the same spirit There are heavy excises on those articles when used in England On export these excises are drawn back But instead of withholding the drawback which might have been done with ease without charge without possibility of smuggling and instead of applying the money money already in your hands according to your pleasure you began your operations in finance by flinging away your revenue you allowed the whole drawback on export and then you charged the duty which you had before discharged payable in the colonies where it was certain the collection  would devour it to the bone if any revenue were ever suffered to be collected at all One spirit pervades and animates the whole mass  COULD any thing be a subject of more just alarm to America than to see you go out of the plain high road of finance and give up your most certain revenues and your clearest interests merely for the sake of insulting your colonies No man ever doubted that the commodity of Tea could bear an imposition of threepence But no commodity will bear threepence or will bear a penny when the general feelings of men are irritated and two millions of people are resolved not to pay The feelings of the Colonies were formerly the feelings of Great Britain Theirs were formerly the feelings of Mr Hampden when called upon for the payment of twenty shillings Would twenty shillings have ruined Mr Hampden's fortune No but the payment of half twenty shillings on the principle it was demanded would have made him a slave It is the weight of that preamble of which you are so fond and not the weight of the duty that the Americans are unable and unwilling to bear  IT is then sir upon the  principle  of this measure and nothing else that we are at issue It is a principle of political expediency Your act of asserts that it is expedient to raise a revenue in America your act of which takes away that revenue contradicts the act of and by something much stronger than words asserts that it is not expedient It is a reflection upon your wisdom to persist in a solemn parliamentary declaration of the expediency of any object for which at the same time you make no sort of provision And pray sir let not this circumstance escape you it is very material that the preamble of  this act which we wish to repeal is not  declaratory of a right  as some gentlemen seem to argue it it is only a recital of the  expediency  of a certain exercise of a right supposed already to have been asserted an exercise you are now contending for by ways and means which you confess though they were obeyed to be utterly insufficient for their purpose You are therefore at this moment in the aukward situation of fighting for a phantom a quiddity a thing that wants not only a substance but even a name for a thing which is neither abstract right nor profitable enjoyment  THEY tell you sir that your dignity is tied to it I know not how it happens but this dignity of yours is a terrible incumbrance to you for it has of late been ever at war with your interest your equity and every idea of your policy Shew the thing you contend for to be reason shew it to be common sense shew it to be the means of attaining some useful end and then I am content to allow it what dignity you please But what dignity is derived from the perseverance in absurdity is more than ever I could discern The hon gentleman has said wellindeed in most of his  general  observations I agree with himhe says that this subject does not stand as it did formerly Oh certainly not every hour you continue on this illchosen ground your difficulties thicken on you and therefore my conclusion is remove from a bad position as quickly as you can The disgrace and the necessity of yielding both of them grow upon you every hour of your delay  BUT will you repeal the act says the hon gentleman at this instant when America is in open resistance to your authority and that you have just revived your system of taxation He thinks he has driven us into a corner But thus pent up I am  content to meet him because I enter the lists supported by my old authority his new friends the ministers themselves The hon gentleman remembers that about five years ago as great disturbances as the present prevailed in America on account of the new taxes The ministers represented these disturbances as treasonable and this house thought proper on that representation to make a famous address for a revival and for a new application of a statute of H VIII We besought the king in that wellconsidered address to inquire into treasons and to bring the supposed traitors from America to Great Britain for trial His majesty was pleased graciously to promise a compliance with our request All the attempts from this side of the house to resist these violences and to bring about a repeal were treated with the utmost scorn An apprehension of the very consequences now stated by the hon gentleman was then given as a reason for shutting the door against all hope of such an alteration And so strong was the spirit for supporting the new taxes that the session concluded with the following remarkable declaration After stating the vigorous measures which had been pursued the speech from the throne proceeds  YOU have assured me of your  firm  support in the  prosecution  of them Nothing in my opinion could be more likely to enable the welldisposed among my subjects in that part of the world effectually to discourage and defeat the designs of the factious and seditious than the hearty concurrence of every branch of the legislature in  maintaining the execution of the laws in every  part of my dominions  AFTER this no man dreamt that a repeal under this ministry could possibly take place The hon gentleman knows as well as I that the idea was  utterly exploded by those who sway the house This speech was made on the ninth day of May Five days after this speech that is on the th of the same month the public circular letter a part of which I am going to read to you was written by lord Hillsborough secretary of state for the colonies After reciting the substance of the king's speech he goes on thus  "  I CAN take upon me to assure you notwithstanding insinuations to the contrary from men with  factious and seditious views  that his majesty's  present administration have at no time entertained a design to propose to parliament to lay any further taxes upon America for the purpose of RAISING A REVENUE  and that it is at present their intention to propose the next session of parliament to take off the duties upon glass paper and colours upon consideration of such duties  having been laid contrary to the true principles of commerce"  "  THESE have  always  been and  still are  the sentiments of his  majesty's present servants  and by which their conduct in  respect to America has been governed  And  his majesty  relies upon your prudence and fidelity for such an explanation of  his  measures as may tend to remove the prejudices which have been excited by the misrepresentations of those who are enemies to the peace and prosperity of Great Britain and her colonies and to reestablish that mutual  confidence and affection  upon which the glory and safety of the British empire depend  "  HERE sir is a canonical book of ministerial scripture the general epistle to the Americans What does the gentleman say to it Here a repeal is promised promised without condition and while your authority was actually resisted I pass  by the public promise of a peer relative to the repeal of taxes by this house I pass by the use of the king's name in a matter of supply that sacred and reserved right of the commons I conceal the ridiculous figure of parliament hurling its thunders at the gigantic rebellion of America and then five days after prostrate at the feet of those assemblies we affected to despise begging them by the intervention of our ministerial sureties to receive our submission and heartily promising amendment These might have been serious matters formerly but we are grown wiser than our fathers Passing therefore from the constitutional consideration to the mere policy does not this letter imply that the idea of taxing America for the purpose of revenue is an abominable project when the ministry suppose none but  factious  men and with seditious views could charge them with it does not this letter adopt and sanctify the American distinction of  taxing for a revenue  does it not formally reject all future taxation on that principle does it not state the ministerial rejection of such principle of taxation not as the occasional but the constant opinion of the king's servants does it not say I care not how consistently but does it not say that their conduct with regard to America has been  always  governed by this policy It goes a great deal further These excellent and trusty servants of the king justly fearful lest they themselves should have lost all credit with the world bring out the image of their gracious sovereign from the inmost and most sacred shrine and they pawn him as a security for their promises  "  His majesty  relies on your prudence and fidelity for such an explanation of  his  measures"  These sentiments of the minister and these measures of his majesty can only relate to the principle and practice of taxing for a revenue and accordingly  lord Botetourt stating it as such did with great propriety and in the exact spirit of his instructions endeavour to remove the fears of the Virginian assembly lest the sentiments which it seems unknown to the world had  always  been those of the ministers and by which  their  conduct  in respect to America had been governed  should by some possible revolution favourable to wicked American taxers be hereafter counteracted He addresses them in this manner  IT may possibly be objected that as his majesty's present administration are  not immortal  their successors may be inclined to attempt to undo what the present ministers shall have attempted to perform and to that objection I can give but this answer that it is my firm opinion that the plan I have stated to you will certainly take place and that it will never be departed from and so determined am I for ever to abide by it that I will be content to be declared infamous if I do not to the last hour of my life at all times in all places and upon all occasions exert every power with which I either am or ever shall be legally invested in order to obtain and  maintain  for the continent of America that  satisfaction  which I have been authorised to promise this day by the  confidential  servants of our gracious sovereign who to my certain knowledge rates his honour so high  that he would rather part with his crown than preserve it by deceit  A material point is omitted by Mr Burke in this speech viz  the manner in which the continent received this royal assurance  The assembly of Virginia in their address in answer to lord Botetourt's speech express themselves thus  "We will not suffer our present hopes arising from the pleasing prospect your lordship hath so kindly opened and displayed to us to be dashed by the bitter reflection that any  future  administration will entertain a wish to depart from that  plan  which affords the surest and most permanent foundation of public tranquillity and happiness no my lord we are sure  our most gracious sovereign  under whatever changes may happen in his confidential servants will remain immutable in the ways of truth and justice and that he is  incapable of deceiving his faithful subjects  and we esteem your lordship's information not only as warranted but even sanctified  by the royal word  "  A GLORIOUS and true character which since we suffer his ministers with impunity to answer for his ideas of taxation we ought to make it our business to enable his majesty to preserve in all its lustre Let him have character since ours is no more Let some part of government be kept in respect  THIS epistle was not the letter of lord Hillsborough solely though he held the official pen It was the letter of the noble lord upon the floor  Lord North  and of all the king's then ministers who with I think the exception of two only are his ministers at this hour The very first news that a British parliament heard of what it was to do with the duties which it had given and granted to the king was by the publication of the votes of American assemblies It was in America that your resolutions were predeclared It was from thence that we knew to a certainty how much exactly and not a scruple more or less we were to repeal We were unworthy to be let into the secret of our own conduct The assemblies had  confidential  communications from his majesty's  confidential  servants We were nothing but instruments Do you after this wonder that you have no weight and no respect in the colonies After this are you surprized that prrliament is every day and every where losing I feel it with sorrow I utter it with reluctance that reverential affection which so endearing a name of authority ought ever to carry with it that you are obeyed solely from respect to the bayonet  and that this house the ground and pillar of freedom is itself held up only by the treacherous underpinning and clumsy buttresses of arbitrary power  IF this dignity which is to stand in the place of just policy and common sense had been consulted there was a time for preserving it and for reconciling it with any concession If in the session of that session of idle terror and empty menaces you had as you were often pressed to do repealed these taxes then your strong operations would have come justified and enforced in case your concessions had been returned by outrages But preposterously you began with violence and before terrors could have any effect either good or bad your ministers immediately begged pardon and promised that repeal to the obstinate Americans which they had refused in an easy goodnatured complying British parliament The assemblies which had been publicly and avowedly dissolved for  their  contumacy are called together to receive  your  submission Your ministerial directors blustered like tragic tyrants here and then went mumping with a sore leg in America canting and whining and complaining of faction which represented them as friends to a revenue from the colonies I hope nobody in this house will hereafter have the impudence to defend American taxes in the name of ministry The moment they do with this letter of attorney in my hand I will tell them in the authorised terms they are wretches  "with factious and seditious views enemies to the peace and prosperity of the mother country and the colonies" and subverters "of the mutual affection and confidence on which the glory and safety of the British empire depend"  AFTER this letter the question is no more on propriety or dignity They are gone already The faith of your sovereign is pledged for the political principle The general declaration in the letter goes to the whole of it You must therefore either abandon the scheme of taxing or you must send the ministers tarred and feathered to America who dared to hold out the royal faith for a renunciation of all taxes for revenue Them you must punish or this faith you must preserve The preservation of this faith is of more consequence than the duties on  red lead  or  white lead  or on broken  glass  or  atlas ordinary  or  demifine  or  blueroyal  or  bastard  or  fool'scap  which you have given up or the three pence on tea which you retained The letter went stampt with the public authority of this kingdom The instructions for the colony government go under no other sanction and America cannot believe and will not obey you if you do not preserve this channel of communication sacred You are now punishing the colonies for acting on distinctions held out by that very ministry which is here shining in riches in favour and in power and urging the punishment of the very offence to which they had themselves been the tempters  SIR if reasons respecting simply your own commerce which is your own convenience were the sole grounds of the repeal of the five duties why does lord Hillsborough in disclaiming in the name of the king and ministry their ever had having an intent to tax for revenue mention it as the means  "of reestablishing the confidence and affection of the colonies"  Is it a way of soothing  others  to assure them that you will take good care of  yourself  The medium the only medium for regaining their affection and confidence is that you will  take off something oppressive to their minds Sir the letter strongly enforces that idea for though the repeal of the taxes is promised on commercial principles yet the means of counteracting  "the insinuations of men with factious and seditious views"  is by a disclaimer of the intention of taxing for revenue as a constant invariable sentiment and rule of conduct in the government of America  I REMEMBER that the noble lord on the floor not in a former debate to be sure it would be disorderly to refer to it I suppose I read it somewhere but the noble lord was pleased to say that he did not conceive how it could enter into the head of man to impose such taxes as those of I mean those taxes which he voted for imposing and voted for repealing as being taxes contrary to all the principles of commerce laid on  British manufactures    I DARE say the noble lord is perfectly well read because the duty of his particular office requires he should be so in all our revenue laws and in the policy which is to be collected out of them Now sir when he had read this act of American revenue and a little recovered from his astonishment I suppose he made one step retrograde it is but one and looked at the act which stands just before in the statute book The American revenue act is the fortyfifth chapter the other to which I refer is the fortyfourth of the same session These two acts are both to the same purpose both revenue acts both taxing out of the kingdom and both taxing British manufactures exported As the th is an act for raising a revenue in America the th is an act for raising a revenue in the Isle of Man The two acts perfectly agree in all respects except one In the act for taxing the Isle of Man the  noble lord will find not as in the American act four or five articles but almost the  whole body  of British manufactures taxed from two and an half to fifteen  per cent  and some articles such as that of spirits a great deal higher You did not think it uncommercial to tax the whole mass of your manufactures and let me add your agriculture too for I now recollect British corn is there also taxed up to ten  per cent  and this too in the very headquarters the very citadel of smuggling the Isle of Man Now will the noble lord condescend to tell me why he repealed the taxes on your manufactures sent out to America and not the taxes on the manufactures exported to the Isle of Man The principle was exactly the same the objects charged infinitely more extensive the duties without comparison higher Why why notwithstanding all his childish pretexts because the taxes were quietly submitted to in the Isle of Man and because they raised a flame in America Your reasons were political not commercial The repeal was made as lord Hillsborough's letter well expresses it to regain  "the confidence and affection of the colonies on which the glory and safety of the British empire depend"  A wise and just motive surely if ever there was such But the mischief and dishonour is that you have not done what you had given the colonies just cause to expect when your ministers disclaimed the idea of taxes for a revenue There is nothing simple nothing manly nothing ingenuous open decisive or steady in the proceeding with regard either to the continuance or the repeal of the taxes The whole has an air of littleness and fraud The article of tea is slurred over in the circular letter as it were by accidentnothing is said of a resolution either to keep that tax or to give it up There is no fair dealing in any part of the transaction  IF you mean to follow your true motive and your public faith give up your tax on tea for raising a revenue the principle of which has in effect been disclaimed in your name and which produces you no advantages no not a penny Or if you choose to go on with a poor pretence instead of a solid reason and will still adhere to your cant of commerce you have ten thousand times more strong commercial reasons for giving up this duty on tea than for abandoning the five others that you have already renounced  THE American consumption of teas is annually I believe worth l at the least farthing If you urge the American violence as a justification of your perseverance in enforcing this tax you know that you can never answer this plain questionWhy did you repeal the others given in the same act whilst the very same violence subsisted But you did not find the violence cease upon that concessionNo because the concession was far short of satisfying the principle which lord Hillsborough had abjured or even the pretence on which the repeal of the other taxes was announced and because by enabling the East India company to open a shop for defeating the American resolution not to pay that specific tax you manifestly shewed a hankering after the principle of the act which you formerly had renounced Whatever road you take leads to a compliance with this motion It opens to you at the end of every vista Your commerce your policy your promises your reasons your pretences your consistency your inconsistencyall jointly oblige you to this repeal  BUT still it sticks in our throats if we go so far the Americans will go fartherWe do not know that We ought from experience rather to presume the contrary Do we not know for certain  that the Americans are going on as fast as possible whilst we refuse to gratify them can they do more or can they do worse if we yield this point I think this concession will rather fix a turnpike to prevent their further progress It is impossible to answer for bodies of men But I am sure the natural effect of fidelity clemency kindness in governors is peace goodwill order and esteem on the part of the governed I would certainly at least give these fair principles a fair trial which since the making of this act to this hour they never have had  SIR The hon gentleman having spoken what he thought necessary upon the narrow part of the subject I have given him I hope a satisfactory answer He next presses me by a variety of direct challenges and oblique reflexions to say something on the historical part I shall therefore sir open myself fully on that important and delicate subject not for the sake of telling you a long story which I know Mr Speaker you are not particularly fond of but for the sake of the weighty instruction that I flatter myself will necessarily result from it It shall not be longer if I can help it than so serious a matter requires  PERMIT me then sir to lead your attention very far back back to the act of navigation the cornerstone of the policy of this country with regard to its colonies Sir that policy was from the beginning purely commercial and the commercial system was wholly restrictive It was the system of a monopoly No trade was let loose from that constraint but merely to enable the colonists to dispose of what in the course of your trade you could not take or to enable them to dispose of such articles as we forced upon them and for which without some degree of liberty they could not pay Hence all  your specific and detailed enumerations hence the innumerable checks and counterchecks hence that infinite variety of paper chains by which you bind together this complicated system of the Colonies This principle of commercial monopoly runs through no less than twentynine acts of parliament from the year to the unfortunate period of  IN all those acts the system of commerce is established as that from whence alone you proposed to make the Colonies contribute I mean directly and by the operation of your superintending legislative power to the strength of the empire I venture to say that during that whole period a parliamentary revenue from thence was never once in contemplation Accordingly in all the number of laws passed with regard to the plantations the words which distinguish revenue laws specifically as such were I think premeditately avoided I do not say sir that a form of words alters the nature of the law or abridges the power of the lawgiver It certainly does not However titles and formal preambles are not always idle words and the lawyers frequently argue from them I state these facts to shew not what was your right but what has been your settled policy Our revenue laws have usually a  title  purporting their being  grants  and the words  give and grant  usually precede the enacting parts Although duties were imposed on America in acts of king Charles the second and in acts of king William no one title of giving  "an aid to his majesty"  or any other of the usual titles to revenue acts was to be found in any of them till nor were the words  "give and grant"  in any preamble until the th of George the second However the title of this act of George the second notwithstanding the words of  donation considers it merely as a regulation of trade  "An act for the better securing of the trade of his majesty's sugar colonies in America"  This act was made on a compromise of all and at the express desire of a part of the colonies themselves It was therefore in some measure with their consent and having a title directly purporting only a  commercial regulation  and being in truth nothing more the words were passed by at a time when no jealousy was entertained and things were little scrutinized Even governor Bernard in his second printed letter dated in gives it as his opinion that  "it was an act of  prohibition  not of revenue"  This is certainly true that no act avowedly for the purpose of revenue and with the ordinary title and recital taken together is found in the statute book until the year I have mentioned that is the year All before this period stood on commercial regulation and restraint The scheme of a colony revenue by British authority appeared therefore to the Americans in the light of a great innovation The words of governor Bernard's ninth letter written in November state this idea very strongly  "it must" says he "have been supposed  such an innovation as a parliamentary taxation  would cause a great  alarm  and meet with much  opposition  in most parts of America it was  quite new  to the people and had no  visible bounds  set to it"  After stating the weakness of government there he says  "was this a time to introduce  so great a novelty  as a parliamentary inland taxation in America"  Whatever the right might have been this mode of using it was absolutely new in policy and practice  SIR they who are friends to the schemes of American revenue say that the commercial restraint is full as hard a law for America to live under  I think so too I think it if uncompensated to be a condition of as rigorous servitude as men can be subject to But America bore it from the fundamental act of navigation until Why Because men do bear the inevitable constitution of original nature with all its infirmities The act of navigation attended the Colonies from their infancy grew with their growth and strengthened with their strength They were confirmed in obedience to it even more by usage than by law They scarcely had remembered a time when they were not subject to such restraint Besides they were indemnified for it by a pecuniary compensation Their monopolist happened to be one of the richest men in the world By his immense capital primarily employed not for their benefit but his own they were enabled to proceed with their fisheries their agriculture their shipbuilding and their trade too within the limits in such a manner as got far the start of the slow languid operations of unassisted nature This capital was a hotbed to them Nothing in the history of mankind is like their progress For my part I never cast an eye on their flourishing commerce and their cultivated and commodious life but they seem to me rather ancient nations grown to perfection through a long series of fortunate events and a train of successful industry accumulating wealth in many centuries than the Colonies of yesterday than a set of miserable outcasts a few years ago not so much sent as thrown out on the bleak and barren shore of a desolate wilderness three thousand miles from all civilized intercourse  ALL this was done by England whilst England pursued trade and forgot revenue You not only acquired commerce but you actually created the very objects of trade in America and by that  creation you raised the trade of this kingdom at least fourfold America had the compensation of your capital which made her bear her servitude She had another compensation which you are now going to take away from her She had except the commercial restraint every characteristic mark of a free people in all her internal concerns She had the image of the British constitution She had the substance She was taxed by her own representatives She chose most of her own representatives She paid them all She had in effect the sole disposal of her own internal government This whole state of commercial servitude and civil liberty taken together is certainly not perfect freedom but comparing it with the ordinary circumstances of human nature it was an happy and a liberal condition  I KNOW sir that great and not unsuccessful pains have been taken to inflame our minds by an outery in this house and out of it that in America the act of navigation neither is or ever was obeyed But if you take the colonies through I affirm that its authority never was disputed that it was no where disputed for any length of time and on the whole that it was well observed Wherever the act pressed hard many individuals indeed evaded it This is nothing These scattered individuals never denied the law and never obeyed it Just as it happens whenever the laws of trade whenever the laws of revenue press hard upon the people in England in that case all your shores are full of contraband Your right to give a monopoly to the East India company your right to lay immense duties on French brandy are not disputed in England You do not make this charge on any man But you know that there is not a creek from Pentland Frith to the Isle of Wight  in which they do not smuggle immense quantities of Teas East India goods and brandies I take it for granted that the authority of governor Bernard in this point is indisputable Speaking of these laws as they regarded that part of America now in so unhappy a condition he says  "I believe they are no where better supported than in this province I do not pretend that it is entirely free from a breach of these laws but that such a breach if discovered is justly punished"  What more can you say of the obedience to any laws in any country An obedience to these laws formed the acknowledgment instituted by yourselves for your superiority and was the payment you originally imposed for your protection  WHETHER you were right or wrong in establishing the colonies on the principles of commercial monopoly rather than on that of revenue is at this day a problem of mere speculation You cannot have both by the same authority To join together the restraints of an universal internal and external monopoly with an universal internal and external taxation is an unnatural union perfect uncompensated slavery You have long since decided for yourself and them and you and they have prospered exceedingly under that decision  THIS nation sir never thought of departing from that choice until the period immediately on the close of the last war Then a scheme of government new in many things seemed to have been adopted I saw or thought I saw several symptoms of a great change whilst I sat in your gallery a good while before I had the honour of a seat in this house At that period the necessity was established of keeping up no less than twenty new regiments with twenty colonels capable of seats in this house This scheme was adopted with very  general applause from all sides at the very time that by your conquests in America your danger from foreign attempts in that part of the world was much lessened or indeed rather quite over When this huge increase of military establishment was resolved on a revenue was to be found to support so great a burthen Country gentlemen the great patrons of oeconomy and the great resisters of a standing armed force would not have entered with much alacrity into the vote for so large and so expensive an army if they had been very sure that they were to continue to pay for it But hopes of another kind were held out to them and in particular I well remember that Mr Townshend in a brilliant harangue on this subject did dazzle them by playing before their eyes the image of a revenue to be raised in America  HERE began to dawn the first glimmerings of this new Colony system It appeared more distinctly afterwards when it was devolved upon a person to whom on other accounts this country owes very great obligations I do believe that he had a very serious desire to benefit the public But with no small study of the detail he did not seem to have his view at least equally carried to the total circuit of our affairs He generally considered his objects in lights that were rather too detached Whether the business of an American revenue was imposed upon him altogether whether it was entirely the result of his own speculation or what is more probable that his own ideas rather coincided with the instructions he had received certain it is that with the best intentions in the world he first brought this fatal scheme into form and established it by act of parliament  NO man can believe that at this time of day I mean to lean on the venerable memory of a great  man whose loss we deplore in common Our little partydifferences have been along ago composed and I have acted more with him and certainly with more pleasure with him than ever I acted against him Undoubtedly Mr Grenville was a firstrate figure in this country With a masculine understanding and a stout and resolute heart he had an application undissipated and unwearied He took public business not as a duty which he was to fulfil but as a pleasure he was to enjoy and he seemed to have no delight out of this house except in such things as some way related to the business that was to be done within it If he was ambitious I will say this for him his ambition was of a noble and generous strain It was to raise himself not by the low pimping politics of a court but to win his way to power through the laborious gradations of public service and to secure to himself a wellearned rank in parliament by a thorough knowledge of its constitution and a perfect practice in all its business  SIR if such a man fell into errors it must be from defects not intrinsical they must be rather sought in the particular habits of his life which though they do not alter the groundwork of character yet tinge it with their own hue He was bred in a profession He was bred to the law which is in my opinion one of the first and noblest of human sciences a science which does more to quicken and invigorate the understanding than all the other kinds of learning put together but it is not apt except in persons very happily born to open and to liberalize the mind exactly in the same proportion Passing from that study he did not go very largely into the world but plunged into business I mean into the business of office and the limited and fixed methods and forms established there  Much knowledge is to be had undoubtedly in that line and there is no knowledge which is not valuable But it may be truly said that men too much conversant in office are rarely minds of remarkable enlargement Their habits of office are apt to give them a turn to think the substance of business not to be much more important than the forms in which it is conducted These forms are adapted to ordinary occasions and therefore persons who are nurtured in office do admirably well as long as things go on in their common order but when the high roads are broken up and the waters out when a new and troubled scene is opened and the file affords no precedent then it is that a greater knowledge of mankind and a far more extensive comprehension of things is requisite than ever office gave or than office can ever give Mr Grenville thought better of the wisdom and power of human legislation than in truth it deserves He conceived and many conceived along with him that the flourishing trade of this country was greatly owing to law and institution and not quite so much to liberty for but too many are apt to believe regulation to be commerce and taxes to be revenue Among regulations that which stood first in reputation was his idol I mean the act of navigation He has often professed it to be so The policy of that act is I readily admit in many respects well understood But I do say that if the act be suffered to run the full length of its principle and is not changed and modified according to the change of times and the fluctuation of circumstances it must do great mischief and frequently even defeat its own purpose  AFTER the war and in the last year of it the trade of America had encreased far beyond the speculations of the most sanguine imagination It  swelled out on every side It filled all its proper channels to the brim It overflowed with a rich redundance and breaking its banks on the right and on the left it spread out upon some places where it was indeed improper upon others where it was only irregular It is the nature of all greatness not to be exact and great trade will always be attended with considerable abuses The contraband will always keep pace in some measure with the fair trade It should stand as a fundamental maxim that no vulgar precaution ought to be employed in the cure of evils which are closely connected with the cause of our prosperity Perhaps this great person turned his eyes somewhat less than was just towards the incredible increase of the fair trade and looked with something of too exquisite a jealousy towards the contraband He certainly felt a singular degree of anxiety on the subject and even began to act from that passion earlier than is commonly imagined For whilst he was first lord of the admiralty though not strictly called upon in his official line he presented a very strong memorial to the lords of the treasury my lord Bute was then at the head of the board heavily complaining of the growth of the illicit commerce in America Some mischief happened even at that time from this overearnest zeal Much greater happened afterwards when it operated with greater power in the highest department of the finances The bonds of the act of navigation were straitened so much that America was on the point of having no trade either contraband or legitimate They found under the construction and execution then used the act no longer tying but actually strangling them All this coming with new enumerations of commodities with regulations which in a manner put a stop to the mutual coasting intercourse of the colonies with the  appointment of courts of admiralty under various improper circumstances with a sudden extinction of the paper currencies with a compulsory provision for the quartering of soldiers the people of America thought themselves proceeded against as delinquents or at best as people under suspicion of delinquency and in such a manner as they imagined their recent services in the war did not at all merit Any of these innumerable regulations perhaps would not have alarmed alone some might be thought reasonable the multitude struck them with terror  BUT the grand manoeuvre in that business of new regulating the colonies was the th act of the fourth of George III which besides containing several of the matters to which I have just alluded opened a new principle and here properly began the second period of the policy of this country with regard to the colonies by which the scheme of a regular plantation parliamentary revenue was adopted in theory and settled in practice A revenue not substituted in the place of but superadded to a monopoly which monopoly was enforced at the same time with additional strictness and the execution put into military hands  THIS act sir had for the first time the title of  "granting duties in the colonies and plantations of America"  and for the first time it was asserted in the preamble  "that it was  just  and  necessary  that a revenue should be raised there"  Then came the technical words of  "giving and granting"  and thus a complete American revenue act was made in all the forms and with a full avowal of the right equity policy and even necessity of taxing the colonies without any formal consent of theirs There are contained also in the preamble to that act these very remarkable words  the commons c  "being desirous to make  some  provision in the  present  session of parliament  towards  raising the said revenue"  By these words it appeared to the colonies that this act was but a beginning of sorrows that every session was to produce something of the same kind that we were to go on from day to day in charging them with such taxes as we pleased for such a military force as we should think proper Had this plan been pursued it was evident that the provincial assemblies in which the Americans felt all their portion of importance and beheld their sole image of freedom were  ipso facto  annihilated This ill prospect before them seemed to be boundless in extent and endless in duration Sir they were not mistaken The ministry valued themselves when this act passed and when they gave notice of the stamp act that both of the duties came very short of their ideas of American taxation Great was the applause of this measure here In England we cried out for new taxes on America whilst they cried out that they were nearly crushed with those which the war and their own grants had brought upon them  SIR it has been said in the debate that when the first American revenue act the act in imposing the port duties passed the Americans did not object to the principle It is true they touched it but very tenderly It was not a direct attack They were it is true as yet novices as yet unaccustomed to direct attacks upon any of the rights of parliament The duties were port duties like those they had been accustomed to bear with this difference that the title was not the same the preamble not the same and the spirit altogether unlike But of what service is this observation to the cause of those that make it It is a  full refutation of the pretence for their present cruelty to America for it shews out of their own mouths that our colonies were backward to enter into the present vexatious and ruinous controversy  THERE is also another circulation abroad spread with a malignant intention which I cannot attribute to those who say the same thing in this house that Mr Grenville gave the colony agents an option for their assemblies to tax themselves which they had refused I find that much stress is laid on this as a fact However it happens neither to be true nor possible I will observe first that Mr Grenville never thought fit to make this apology for himself in the innumerable debates that were had upon the subject He might have proposed to the colony agents that they should agree in some  mode  of taxation as the ground of an act of parliament But he never could have proposed that they should tax themselves on requisition which is the assertion of the day Indeed Mr Grenville well knew that the colony agents could have no general powers to consent to it and they had no time to consult their assemblies for particular powers before he passed his first revenue act If you compare dates you will find it impossible Burthened as the agents knew the colonies were at that time they could not give the least hope of such grants His own favourite governor was of opinion that the Americans were not then taxable objects  "  NOR was the time less favourable to the  equity  of such a taxation I don't mean to dispute the reasonableness of America contributing to the charges of Great Britain  when she is able  nor I believe would the Americans themselves have disputed it at a  proper time and season  But it should be considered that the American governments themselves have in the prosecution  of the late war contracted very large debts which it will take some years to pay off and in the mean time occasion very  burdensome taxes for that purpose  only For instance this government which is as much beforehand as any raises every year l sterling for sinking their debt and must continue it for four years longer at least before it will be clear  "  THESE are the words of governor Bernard's letter to a member of the old ministry and which he has since printed Mr Grenville could not have made this proposition to the agents for another reason He was of opinion which he has declared in this house an hundred times that the colonies could not legally grant any revenue to the crown and that infinite mischiefs would be the consequence of such a power When Mr Grenville had passed the first revenue act and in the same session had made this house come to a resolution for laying a stampduty on America between that time and the passing the stampact into a law he told a considerable and most respectable merchant a member of this house whom I am truly sorry I do not now see in his place when he represented against this proceeding that if the stampduty was disliked he was willing to exchange it for any other equally productive but that if he objected to the Americans being taxed by parliament he might save himself the trouble of the discussion as he was determined on the measure This is the fact and if you please I will mention a very unquestionable authority for it  THUS sir I have disposed of this falsehood But falsehood has a perennial spring It is said that no conjecture could be made of the dislike of the colonies to the principle This is as untrue as the other After the resolution of the house and  before the passing of the stampact the colonies of Massachuset's Bay and New York did send remonstrances objecting to this mode of parliamentary taxation What was the consequence They were suppressed they were put under the table notwithstanding an order of council to the contrary by the ministry which composed the very council that had made the order and thus the house proceeded to its business of taxing without the least regular knowledge of the objections which were made to it But to give that house its due it was not overdesirous to receive information or to hear remonstrance On the th of February whilst the stampact was under deliberation they refused with scorn even so much as to receive four petitions presented from so respectable colonies as Connecticut Rhode Island Virginia and Carolina besides one from the traders of Jamaica As to the colonies they had no alternative left to them but to disobey or to pay the taxes imposed by that parliament which was not suffered or did not suffer itself even to hear them remonstrate upon the subject  THIS was the state of the colonies before his majesty thought fit to change his ministers It stands upon no authority of mine It is proved by uncontrovertible records The hon gentleman has desired some of us to lay our hands upon our hearts and answer to his queries upon the historical part of this consideration and by his manner as well as my eyes could discern it he seemed to address himself to me  SIR I will answer him as clearly as I am able and with great openness I have nothing to conceal In the year sixtyfive being in a very private station far enough from any line of business and not having the honour of a seat in this house  it was my fortune unknowing and unknown to the then ministry by the intervention of a common friend to become connected with a very noble person and at the head of the treasury department It was indeed in a situation of little rank and no consequence suitable to the mediocrity of my talents and pretensions But a situation near enough to enable me to see as well as others what was going on and I did see in that noble person such sound principles such an enlargement of mind such clear and sagacious sense and such unshaken fortitude as have bound me as well as others much better than me by an inviolable attachment to him from that time forward Sir lord Rockingham very early in that summer received a strong representation from many weighty English merchants and manufacturers from governors of provinces and commanders of men of war against almost the whole of the American commercial regulations and particularly with regard to the total ruin which was threatened to the Spanish trade I believe sir the noble lord soon saw his way in this business But he did not rashly determine against acts which it might be supposed were the result of much deliberation However sir he scarcely began to open the ground when the whole veteran body of office took the alarm A violent outcry of all except those who knew and felt the mischief was raised against any alteration On one hand his attempt was a direct violation of treaties and public lawOn the other the act of navigation and all the corps of trade laws were drawn up in array against it  THE first step the noble lord took was to have the opinion of his excellent learned and everlamented friend the late Mr Yorke then attorney general on the point of law When he knew  that formally and officially which in substance he had known before he immediately dispatched orders to redress the grievance But I will say it for the then minister he is of that constitution of mind that I know he would have issued on the same critical occasion the very same orders if the acts of trade had been as they were not directly against him and would have chearfully submitted to the equity of parliament for his indemnity  ON the conclusion of this business of the Spanish trade the news of the troubles on account of the stampact arrived in England It was not until the end of October that these accounts were received No sooner had the sound of that mighty tempest reached us in England than the whole of the then opposition instead of feeling humbled by the unhappy issue of their measures seemed to be infinitely elated and cried out that the ministry from envy to the glory of their predecessors were prepared to repeal the stampact Near nine years after the hon gentleman takes quite opposite ground and now challenges me to put my hand to my heart and say whether the ministry had resolved on the repeal till a considerable time after the meeting of parliament Though I do not very well know what the hon gentleman wishes to infer from the admission or from the denial of this fact on which he so earnestly adjures me I do put my hand on my heart and assure him that they did  not  come to a resolution directly to repeal They weighed this matter as its difficulty and importance required They considered maturely among themselves They consulted with all who could give advice or information It was not determined until a little before the meeting of parliament but it was determined and the main lines of their own plan marked out before that meeting Two questions  arose I hope I am not going into a narrative troublesome to the house  A cry of Go on go on  THE first of the two considerations was whether the repeal should be total or whether only partial taking out every thing burthensome and productive and reserving only an empty acknowledgment such as a stamp on cards and dice The other question was On what principle the act should be repealed On this head also two principles were started One that the legislative rights of this country with regard to America were not entire but had certain restrictions and limitations The other principle was that taxes of this kind were contrary to the fundamental principles of commerce on which the colonies were founded and contrary to every idea of political equity by which equity we are bound as much as possible to extend the spirit and benefit of the British constitution to every part of the British dominions The option both of the measure and of the principle of repeal was made before the session and I wonder how any one can read the king's speech at the opening of that session without seeing in that speech both the repeal and the declaratory act very sufficiently crayoned out Those who cannot see this can see nothing  SURELY the hon gentleman will not think that a great deal less time than was then employed ought to have been spent in deliberation when he considers that the news of the troubles did not arrive till towards the end of October The parliament sat to fill the vacancies on the th day of December and on business the th of the following January  SIR a partial repeal or as the  bon ton  of court then was a  modification  would have satisfied a timid unsystematic procrastinating ministry as such a measure has since done such a ministry A modification is the constant resource of weak undeciding minds To repeal by a denial of our right to tax in the preamble and this too did not want advisers would have cut in the heroic style the Gordian knot with a sword Either measure would have cost no more than a day's debate But when the total repeal was adopted and adopted on principles of policy of equity and of commerce this plan made it necessary to enter into many and difficult measures It became necessary to open a very large field of evidence commensurate to these extensive views But then this labour did knights service It opened the eyes of several to the true state of the American affairs it enlarged their ideas it removed prejudices and it conciliated the opinions and affections of men The noble lord who then took the lead in administration my hon friend  Mr Dowdeswell  under me and a right hon gentleman  General Conway  if he will not reject his share and it was a large one of this business exerted the most laudable industry in bringing before you the fullest most impartial and leastgarbled body of evidence that ever was produced to this house I think the enquiry lasted in the committee for six weeks and at its conclusion this house by an independent noble spirited and unexpected majority by a majority that will redeem all the acts ever done by majorities in parliament in the teeth of all the old mercenary Swiss of state in despite of all the speculators and augurs of political events in defiance of the whole embattled legion of veteran pensioners and practised instruments of a court  gave a total repeal to the stampact and if it had been so permitted a lasting piece to this whole empire  I STATE sir these particulars because this act of spirit and fortitude has lately been in the circulation of the season and in some hazarded declamations in this house attributed to timidity If sir the conduct of ministry in proposing the repeal had arisen from timidity with regard to themselves it would have been greatly to be condemned Interested timidity disgraces as much in the cabinet as personal timidity does in the field But timidity with regard to the wellbeing of our country is heroic virtue The noble lord who then conducted affairs and his worthy colleagues whilst they trembled at the prospect of such distresses as you have since brought upon yourselves were not afraid steadily to look in the face that glaring and dazzling influence at which the eyes of eagles have blenched He looked in the face one of the ablest and let me say not the most scrupulous oppositions that perhaps ever was in this house and withstood it unaided by even one of the usual supports of administration He did this when he repealed the stampact He looked in the face a person he had long respected and regarded and whose aid was then particularly wanting I mean lord Chatham He did this when he passed the declaratory act  IT is now given out for the usual purposes by the usual emissaries that lord Rockingham did not consent to the repeal of this act until he was bullied into it by lord Chatham and the reporters have gone so far as publicly to assert in an hundred companies that the hon gentleman under the gallery  General Conway  who proposed the repeal in the American  committee had another set of resolutions in his pocket directly the reverse of those he moved These artifices of a desperate cause are at this time spread abroad with incredible care in every part of the town from the highest to the lowest companies as if the industry of the circulation were to make amends for the absurdity of the report  SIR Whether the noble lord is of a complexion to be bullied by lord Chatham or by any man I must submit to those who know him I confess when I look back to that time I consider him as placed in one of the most trying situations in which perhaps any man ever stood In the house of peers there were very few of the ministry out of the noble lord's own particular connexion except lord Egmont who acted as far as I could discern an honourable and manly part that did not look to some other future arrangement which warped his politics There were in both houses new and menacing appearances that might very naturally drive any other than a most resolute minister from his measure or from his station The household troops openly revolted The allies of ministry those I mean who supported some of their measures but refused responsibility for any endeavoured to undermine their credit and to take ground that must be fatal to the success of the very cause which they would be thought to countenance The question of the repeal was brought on by ministry in the committee of this house in the very instant when it was known that more than one court negociation was carrying on with the heads of the opposition Every thing upon every side was full of traps and mines Earth below shook heaven above menaced all the elements of ministerial safety were dissolved It was in the midst of this chaos of plots and counterplots it was in the midst of this complicated  warfare against public opposition and private treachery that the firmness of that noble person was put to the proof He never stirred from his ground no not an inch He remained fixed and determined in principle in measure and in conduct He practised no managements He secured no retreat He sought no apology  I WILL likewise do justice I ought to do it to the hon gentleman who led us in this house  General Conway  Far from the duplicity wickedly charged on him he acted his part with alacrity and resolution We all felt inspired by the example he gave us down even to myself the weakest in that phalanx I declare for one I knew well enough it could not be concealed from any body the true state of things but in my life I never came with so much spirits into this house It was a time for a  man  to act in We had powerful enemies but we had faithful and determined friends and a glorious cause We had a great battle to fight but we had the means of fighting not as now when our arms are tied behind us We did fight that day and conquer  I REMEMBER sir with a melancholy pleasure the situation of the hon gentleman  General Conway  who made the motion for the repeal in that crisis when the whole trading interest of this empire crammed into your lobbies with a trembling and anxious expectation waited almost to a winter's return of light their fate from your resolutions When at length you had determined in their favour and your doors thrown open shewed them the figure of their deliverer in the wellearned triumph of his important victory from the whole of that grave multitude there arose an involuntary burst of gratitude and transport They jumped upon him like children  on a long absent father They clung about him as captives about their redeemer All England all America joined to his applause Nor did he seem insensible to the best of all earthly rewards the love and admiration of his fellowcitizens  Hope elevated and joy brightened his crest  I stood near him and his face to use the expression of the scripture of the first martyr  "his face was as if it had been the face of an angel"  I do not know how others feel but if I had stood in that situation I never would have exchanged it for all that kings in their profusion could bestow I did hope that that day's danger and honour would have been a bond to hold us all together for ever But alas that with other pleasing visions is long since vanished  SIR this act of supreme magnanimity has been represented as if it had been a measure of an administration that having no scheme of their own took a middle line pilfered a bit from one side and a bit from the other Sir they took  no  middle lines They differed fundamentally from the schemes of both parties but they preserved the objects of both They preserved the authority of Great Britain They preserved the equity of Great Britain They made the declaratory act they repealed the stampact They did both  fully  because the declaratory act was  without qualification  and the repeal of the stampact  total  This they did in the situation I have described  NOW sir what will the adversary say to both these acts If the principle of the declaratory act was not good the principle we are contending for this day is monstrous If the principle of the repeal was not good why are we not at war for a real substantial effective revenue If both were bad why has this ministry incurred all the inconveniencies of  General Conway  both and of all schemes Why have they enacted repealed enforced yielded and now attempt to enforce again  SIR I think I may as well now as at any other time speak to a certain matter of fact not wholly unrelated to the question under your consideration We who would persuade you to revert to the ancient policy of this kingdom labour under the effect of this short current phrase which the court leaders have given out to all their corps in order to take away the credit of those who would prevent you from that frantic war you are going to wage upon your Colonies The cant is this  "All the disturbances in America have been created by the repeal of the stampact"  I suppress for a moment my indignation at the falsehood baseness and absurdity of this most audacious assertion Instead of remarking on the motives and character of those who have issued it for circulation I will clearly lay before you the state of America antecedently to that repeal after the repeal and since the renewal of the schemes of American taxation  IT is said that the disturbances if there were any before the repeal were slight and without difficulty or inconvenience might have been suppressed For an answer to this assertion I will send you to the great author and patron of the stampact who certainly meaning well to the authority of this country and fully apprized of the state of that made before a repeal was so much as agitated in this house the motion which is on your journals and which to save the clerk the trouble of turning to it I will now read to you It was for an amendment to the address of the th of December  "TO  express our just resentment and indignation at the  outrageous tumults and insurrections  which have been excited and carried on in North America and at the resistance given by  open  and  rebellious  force to the execution of the laws in that part of his majesty's dominions And to assure his majesty that his faithful commons animated with the warmest duty and attachment to his royal person and government will firmly and effectually support his majesty in all such measures as shall be necessary for preserving and supporting the legal dependance of the Colonies on the Mother Country  c c"  HERE was certainly a disturbance preceding the repeal such a disturbance as Mr Grenville thought necessary to qualify by the name of an  insurrection  and the epithet of a  rebellious  force terms much stronger than any by which those who then supported his motion have ever since thought proper to distinguish the subsequent disturbances in America They were disturbances which seemed to him and his friends to justify as strong a promise of support as hath been usual to give in the beginning of a war with the most powerful and declared enemies When the accounts of the American governors came before the house they appeared stronger even than the warmth of public imagination had painted them so much stronger that the papers on your table bear me out in saying that all the late disturbances which have been at one time the minister's motives for the repeal of five out of six of the new court taxes and are now his pretences for refusing to repeal that sixth did not amountwhy do I compare them no not to a tenth part of the tumults and violence which prevailed long before the repeal of that act  MINISTRY cannot refuse the authority of the commander in chief general Gage who in his letter  of the th of November from New York thus represents the state of things  "IT  is difficult to say from the  highest to the lowest  who has not been  accessary  to this  insurrection  either by writing or  mutual agreements  to oppose the act by what they are pleased to term all legal opposition to it Nothing effectual has been proposed either to prevent or quell the tumult  The rest of the provinces are in the same situation  as to a positive refusal to take the stamps and threatning those who shall take them  to plunder and murder them  and this affair stands  in all the provinces  that unless the act from its own nature enforce itself nothing but a  very  considerable military force can do it  "  IT is remarkable sir that the persons who formerly trumpeted forth the most loudly the violent resolutions of assemblies the universal insurrections the seizing and burning the stamped papers the forcing stamp officers to resign their commissions under the gallows the rifling and pulling down of the houses of magistrates and the expulsion from their country of all who dared to write or speak a single word in defence of the powers of parliament these very trumpeters are now the men that represent the whole as a mere trifle and choose to date all the disturbances from the repeal of the stampact which put an end to them Hear your officers abroad and let them refute this shameless falsehood who in all their correspondence state the disturbances as owing to their true causes the discontent of the people from the taxes You have this evidence in your own archivesand it will give you compleat satisfaction if you are not so far lost to all parliamentary ideas of information as rather to credit the lye of the day than the records of your own house  SIR this vermin of court reporters when they are forced into day upon one point are sure to burrow in another but they shall have no refuge I will make them bolt out of all their holes Conscious that they must be baffled when they attribute a precedent disturbance to a subsequent measure they take other ground almost as absurd but very common in modern practice and very wicked which is to attribute the ill effect of illjudged conduct to the arguments which had been used to dissuade us from it They say that the opposition made in parliament to the stampact at the time of its passing encouraged the Americans to their resistance This has even formally appeared in print in a regular volume from an advocate of that faction a doctor Tucker This doctor Tucker is already a dean and his earnest labours in this vineyard will I suppose raise him to a bishopric But this assertion too just like the rest is false In all the papers which have loaded your table in all the vast crowd of verbal witnesses that appeared at your bar witnesses which were indiscriminately produced from both sides of the house not the least hint of such a cause of disturbance has ever appeared As to the fact of a strenuous opposition to the stampact I sat as a stranger in your gallery when the act was under consideration Far from any thing inflammatory I never heard a more languid debate in this house No more than two or three gentlemen as I remember spoke against the act and that with great reserve and remarkable temper There was but one division in the whole progress of the bill and the minority did not reach to more than or In the house of lords I do not recollect that there was any debate or division at all I am sure there was no protest In fact the affair passed with so very very little noise that in town they scarcely knew the nature of what you were doing The  opposition to the bill in England never could have done this mischief because there scarcely ever was less of opposition to a bill of consequence  SIR the agents and distributors of falsehoods have with their usual industry circulated another lye of the same nature with the former It is this that the disturbances arose from the account which had been received in America of the change in the ministry No longer awed it seems with the spirit of the former rulers they thought themselves a match for what our calumniators choose to qualify by the name of so feeble a ministry as succeeded Feeble in one sense these men certainly may be called for with all their efforts and they have made many they have not been able to resist the distempered vigour and insane alacrity with which you are rushing to your ruin But it does so happen that the falsity of this circulation is like the rest demonstrated by indisputable dates and records  SO little was the change known in America that the letters of your governors giving an account of these disturbances long after they had arrived at their highest pitch were all directed to the  old ministry  and particularly to the  earl of Halifax  the secretary of state corresponding with the colonies without once in the smallest degree intimating the slightest suspicion of any ministerial revolution whatsoever The ministry was not changed in England until the tenth of July On the th of the preceding June governor Fauquier from Virginia writes thus and writes thus to the earl of Halifax  "  Government is set at  defiance  not having strength enough in her hands to enforce obedience to the laws of the communityThe private distress which every man feels encreases the  general dissatisfaction  at the duties laid by the  stampact  which breaks out and shews itself upon every trifling occasion  "  The general dissatisfaction had produced some time before that is on the th of May several strong public resolves against the stampact and those resolves are assigned by governor Bernard as the cause of the  insurrections  in Massachuset's Bay in his letter of the th of August still addressed to the earl of Halifax and he continued to address such accounts to that minister quite to the th of September of the same year Similar accounts and of as late a date were sent from other governors and all directed to lord Halifax Not one of these letters indicates the slightest idea of a change either known or even apprehended  THUS are blown away the insect race of courtly falsehoods thus perish the miserable inventions of the wretched runners for a wretched cause which they have flyblown into every weak and rotten part of the country in vain hopes that when their maggots had taken wing their importunate buzzing might sound something like the public voice  SIR I have troubled you sufficiently with the state of America before the repeal Now I turn to the hon gentleman who so stoutly challenges us to tell whether after the repeal the provinces were quiet This is coming home to the point Here I meet him directly and answer most readily  They were quiet  And I in my turn challenge him to prove when and where and by whom and in what numbers and with what violence the other laws of trade as gentlemen assert were violated in consequence of your concession or that even your other revenue laws were attacked But I quit the vantage ground on which I stand and where I might leave the burthen of  the proof upon him I walk down upon the open plain and undertake to shew that they were not only quiet but shewed many unequivocal marks of acknowledgment and gratitude And to give him every advantage I select the obnoxious colony of Massachuset's Bay which at this time but without hearing her is so heavily a culprit before parliamentI will select their proceedings even under circumstances of no small irritation For a little imprudently I must say governor Bernard mixed in the administration of the lenitive of the repeal no small acrimony arising from matters of a separate nature Yet see sir the effect of that lenitive though mixed with these bitter ingredients and how these rugged people can express themselves on a measure of concession  "  If it is not now in our power  " say they in their address to governor Bernard "  in so full a manner as will be expected to shew our respectful gratitude to the mother country or to make a dutiful and affectionate return to the indulgence of the king and parliament it shall be no fault of ours for this we intend and hope we shall be able fully to effect  "  WOULD to God that this temper had been cultivated managed and set in action other effect than those which we have since felt would have resulted from it On the requisition for compensation to those who had suffered from the violence of the populace in the same address they say  "  The recommendation enjoined by Mr secretary Conway's letter and in consequence thereof made to us we will embrace the first convenient opportunity to consider and act upon  "  They did consider they did act upon it They obeyed the requisition I know the mode has been chicaned upon but it was substantially obeyed and much better obeyed than I fear the parliamentary requisition of this  session will be though enforced by all your rigour and backed with all your power In a word the damages of popular fury were compensated by legislative gravity Almost every other part of America in various ways demonstrated their gratitude I am bold to say that so sudden a calm recovered after so violent a storm is without parallel in history To say that no other disturbance should happen from any other cause is folly But as far as appearance went by the judicious sacrifice of one law you procured an acquiescence in all that remained After this experience nobody shall persuade me when an whole people are concerned that acts of lenity are not means of conciliation  I HOPE the hon gentleman has received a fair and full answer to his question  I HAVE done with the third period of your policy that of your repeal and the return of your ancient system and your ancient tranquillity and concord Sir this period was not as long as it was happy Another scene was opened and other actors appeared on the stage The state in the condition I have described it was delivered into the hands of lord Chathama great and celebrated name a name that keeps the name of this country respectable in every other on the globe It may be truly called  Clarum et venerabile nomen  Gentibus et multum nostrae quod proderat urbi  SIR the venerable age of this great man his merited rank his superior eloquence his splendid qualities his eminent services the vast space he fills in the eye of mankind and more than all the rest his fall from power which like death canonizes and sanctifies a great character will not suffer me to censure any part of his conduct I am  afraid to flatter him I am sure I am not disposed to blame him Let those who have betrayed him by their adulation insult him with their malevolence But what I do not presume to censure I may have leave to lament For a wise man he seemed to me at that time to be governed too much by general maxims I speak with the freedom of history and I hope without offence One or two of these maxims flowing from an opinion not the most indulgent to our unhappy species and surely a little too general led him into measures that were greatly mischievous to himself and for that reason among others perhaps fatal to his country measures the effects of which I am afraid are for ever incurable He made an administration so checkered and speckled he put together a piece of joinery so crossly indented and whimsically dovetailed a cabinet so variously inlaid such a piece of diversified Mosaic such a tesselated pavement without cement here a bit of black stone and there a bit of white patriots and courtiers kings friends and republicans whigs and tories treacherous friends and open enemies that it was indeed a very curious show but utterly unsafe to touch and unsure to stand on The colleagues whom he had assorted at the same boards stared at each other and were obliged to ask  "Sir your nameSir you have the advantage of meMr Such a oneI beg a thousand pardons"  I venture to say it did so happen that persons had a single office divided between them who had never spoke to each other in their lives until they found themselves they knew not how pigging together heads and points in the same trucklebed  Supposed to allude to the right hon lord North and George Cooke esquire who were made joint paymasters in the Summer of on the removal of the Rockingham administration  SIR In consequence of this arrangement having put so much the larger part of his enemies and opposers into power the confusion was such that his own principles could not possibly have any effect or influence in the conduct of affairs If ever he fell into a fit of the gout or if any other cause withdrew him from public cares principles directly the contrary were sure to predominate When he had executed his plan he had not an inch of ground to stand upon When he had accomplished his scheme of administration he was no longer a minister  WHEN his face was hid but for a moment his whole system was on a wide sea without chart or compass The gentlemen his particular friends who with the names of various departments of ministry were admitted to seem as if they acted a part under him with a modesty that becomes all men and with a confidence in him which was justified even in its extravagance by his superior abilities had never in any instance presumed upon any opinion of their own Deprived of his guiding influence they were whirled about the sport of every gust and easily driven into any port and as those who joined with them in manning the vessel were the most directly opposite to his opinions measures and character and far the most artful and most powerful of the set they easily prevailed so as to seize upon the vacant unoccupied and derelict minds of his friends and instantly they turned the vessel wholly out of the course of his policy As if it were to insult as well as to betray him even long before the close of the first session of his administration when every thing was publicly transacted and with great parade in his name they made an act declaring it highly just and expedient to raise a revenue in America For even  then sir even before this splendid orb was entirely set and while the Western horizon was in a blaze with his descending glory on the opposite quarter of the heavens arose another luminary and for his hour became lord of the ascendant  THIS light too is passed and set for ever You understand to be sure that I speak of Charles Townshend officially the reproducer of this fatal scheme whom I cannot even now remember without some degree of sensibility In truth sir he was the delight and ornament of this house and the charm of every private society which he honoured with his presence Perhaps there never arose in this country nor in any country a man of a more pointed and finished wit and where his passions were not concerned of a more refined exquisite and penetrating a judgment If he had not so great a stock as some have had who flourished formerly of knowledge long treasured up he knew better by far than any man I ever was acquainted with how to bring together within a short time all that was necessary to establish to illustrate and to decorate that side of the question he supported He stated his matter skilfully and powerfully He particularly excelled in a most luminous explanation and display of his subject His style of argument was neither trite and vulgar nor subtile and abstruse He hit the house just between wind and waterAnd not being troubled with too anxious a zeal for any matter in question he was never more tedious or more earnest than the preconceived opinions and present temper of his hearers required to whom he was always in perfect unison He conformed exactly to the temper of the house and he seemed to guide because he was always sure to follow it  I BEG pardon sir if when I speak of this and of other great men I appear to digress in saying something of their characters In this eventful history of the revolutions of America the characters of such men are of much importance Great men are the guideposts and landmarks in the state The credit of such men at court or in the nation is the sole cause of all the public measures It would be an invidious thing most foreign I trust to what you think my disposition to remark the errors into which the authority of great names has brought the nation without doing justice at the same time to the great qualities whence that authority arose The subject is instructive to those who wish to form themselves on whatever of excellence has gone before them There are many young members in the house such of late has been the rapid succession of public men who never saw that prodigy Charles Townshend nor of course know what a ferment he was able to excite in every thing by the violent ebullition of his mixed virtues and failings For failings he had undoubtedlymany of us remember them we are this day considering the effect of them But he had no failings which were not owing to a noble cause to an ardent generous perhaps an immoderate passion for fame a passion which is the instinct of all great souls He worshipped that goddess wheresoever she appeared but he paid his particular devotions to her in her favourite habitation in her chosen temple the house of commons Besides the characters of the individuals that compose our body it is impossible Mr Speaker not to observe that this house has a collective character of its own That character too however imperfect is not unamiable Like all great public collections of men you possess a marked love of virtue and an abhorrence of vice But among vices there is none which the house abhors  in the same degree with  obstinacy  Obstinacy sir is certainly a great vice and in the changeful state of political affairs it is frequently the cause of great mischief It happens however very unfortunately that almost the whole line of the great and masculine virtues constancy gravity magnanimity fortitude fidelity and firmness are closely allied to this disagreeable quality of which you have so just an abhorrence and in their excess all these virtues very easily fall into it He who paid such a punctilious attention to all your feelings certainly took care not to shock them by that vice which is the most disgustful to you  THAT fear of displeasing those who ought most to be pleased betrayed him sometimes into the other extreme He had voted and in the year had been an advocate for the stamp act Things and the disposition of mens minds were changed In short the stamp act began to be no favourite in this house He therefore attended at the private meeting in which the resolutions moved by a right hon gentleman were settled resolutions leading to the repeal The next day he voted for that repeal and he would have spoken for it too if an illness not as was then given out a political but to my knowledge a very real illness had not prevented it  THE very next session as the fashion of this world passeth away the repeal began to be in as bad an odour in this house as the stamp act had been in the session before To conform to the temper which began to prevail and to prevail most amongst those most in power he declared very early in the winter that a revenue must be had out of America Instantly he was tied down to his engagements by some who had no objection to such experiments when made at the cost of persons for  whom they had no particular regard The whole body of courtiers drove him onward They always talked as if the king stood in a sort of humiliated state until something of the kind should be done  HERE this extraordinary man then chancellor of the exchequer found himself in great straits To please universally was the object of his life but to tax and to please no more than to love and to be wise is not given to men However he attempted it To render the tax palatable to the partizans of American revenue he made a preamble stating the necessity of such a revenue To close with the American distinction this revenue was  external  or portduty but again to soften it to the other party it was a duty of  supply  To gratify the  colonists  it was laid on British manufactures to satisfy the  merchants of Britain  the duty was trivial and except that on tea which touched only the devoted East India company on none of the grand objects of commerce To counterwork the American contraband the duty on tea was reduced from a shilling to threepence But to secure the favour of those who would tax America the scene of collection was changed and with the rest it was levied in the colonies What need I say more This finespun scheme had the usual fate of all exquisite policy But the original plan of the duties and the mode of executing that plan both arose singly and solely from a love of our applause He was truly the child of the house He never thought did or said any thing but with a view to you He every day adapted himself to your disposition and adjusted himself before it as at a lookingglass  HE had observed indeed it could not escape him that several persons infinitely his inferiors in all respects had formerly rendered themselves considerable  in this house by one method alone They were a race of men I hope in God the species is extinct who when they rose in their place no man living could divine from any known adherence to parties to opinions or to principles from any order or system in their politics or from any sequel or connection in their ideas what part they were going to take in any debate It is astonishing how much this uncertainty especially at critical times called the attention of all parties on such men All eyes were fixed on them all ears open to hear them each party gaped and looked alternately for their vote almost to the end of their speeches While the house hung in this uncertainty now the  hearhims  rose from this side now they rebellowed from the other and that party to whom they fell at length from their tremulous and dancing balance always received them in a tempest of applause The fortune of such men was a temptation too great to be resisted by one to whom a single whiff of incense withheld gave much greater pain than he received delight in the clouds of it which daily rose about him from the prodigal superstition of innumerable admirers He was a candidate for contradictory honours and his great aim was to make those agree in admiration of him who never agreed in any thing else  HENCE arose this unfortunate act the subject of this day's debate from a disposition which after making an American revenue to please one repealed it to please others and again revived it in hopes of pleasing a third and of catching something in the ideas of all  THIS revenue act of formed the fourth period of American policy How we have fared since thenwhat woeful variety of schemes have been adopted what enforcing and what repealing  what bullying and what submitting what doing and undoing what straining and what relaxing what assemblies dissolving for not obeying and called again without obedience what troops sent out to quell resistance and on meeting that resistance recalled what shiftings and changes and jumblings of all kinds of men at home which left no possibility of order consistency vigour or even so much as a decent unity of colour in any one public measureIt is a tedious irksome task My duty may call me to open it out some other time on a former occasion  Resolutions moved in May  I tried your temper on a part of it for the present I shall forbear  AFTER all these changes and agitations your immediate situation upon the question on your paper is at length brought to this You have an act of parliament stating that  "it is  expedient  to raise a revenue in America"  By a partial repeal you annihilated the greatest part of that revenue which this preamble declares to be so expedient You have substituted no other in the place of it A secretary of state has disclaimed in the king's name all thoughts of such a substitution in future The principle of this disclaimer goes to what has been left as well as what has been repealed The tax which lingers after its companions under a preamble declaring an American revenue expedient and for the sole purpose of supporting the theory of that preamble militates with the assurance authentically conveyed to the colonies and is an exhaustless source of jealousy and animosity On this state which I take to be a fair one not being able to discern any grounds of honour advantage peace or power for adhering either to the act or to the preamble I shall vote for the question which leads to the repeal of both  IF you do not fall in with this motion then secure something to fight for consistent in theory and valuable in practice If you must employ your strength employ it to uphold you in some honourable right or some profitable wrong If you are apprehensive that the concession recommended to you though proper should be a means of drawing on you further but unreasonable claimswhy then employ your force in supporting that reasonable concession against those unreasonable demands You will employ it with more grace with better effect and with great probable concurrence of all the quiet and rational people in the provinces who are now united with and hurried away by the violent having indeed different dispositions but a common interest If you apprehend that on a concession you shall be pushed by a metaphysical process to the extreme lines and argued out of your whole authority my advice is this when you have recovered your old your strong your tenable position then face aboutstop shortdo nothing morereason not at alloppose the ancient policy and practice of the empire as a rampart against the speculations of innovators on both sides of the question and you will stand on great manly and sure ground On this solid basis fix your machines and they will draw worlds towards you  YOUR ministers in their own and his majesty's name have already adopted the American distinction of internal and external duties It is a distinction whatever merit it may have that was originally moved by the Americans themselves and I think they will acquiesce in it if they are not pushed with too much logic and too little sense in all the consequences That is if external taxation be understood as they and you understand it when you please to be not a distinction of geography  but of policy that it is a power for regulating trade and not for supporting establishments The distinction which is as nothing with regard to right is of most weighty consideration in practice Recover your old ground and your old tranquillitytry itI am persuaded the Americans will compromise with you When confidence is once restored the odious and suspicious  summum jus  will perish of course The spirit of practicability of moderation and mutual convenience will never call in geometrical exactness as the arbitrator of an amicable settlement Consult and follow your experience Let not the long story with which I have exercised your patience prove fruitless to your interests  FOR my part I should choose if I could have my wish that the proposition of the  Mr Fuller  hon gentleman for the repeal could go to America without the attendance of the penal bills Alone I could almost answer for its success I cannot be certain of its reception in the bad company it may keep In such heterogeneous assortments the most innocent person will lose the effect of his innocency Though you should send out this angel of peace yet you are sending out a destroying angel too and what would be the effect of the conflict of these two adverse spirits or which would predominate in the end is what I dare not say whether the lenient measures would cause American passion to subside or the severe would increase its furyAll this is in the hand of providence yet now even now I should confide in the prevailing virtue and efficacious operation of lenity though working in darkness and in chaos in the midst of all this unnatural and turbid combination I should hope it might produce order and beauty in the end  LET us sir embrace some system or other before we end this session Do you mean to tax America and to draw a productive revenue from thence if you do speak out name fix ascertain this revenue settle its quantity define its objects provide for its collection and then fight when you have something to fight for If you murderrob If you kill take possession and do not appear in the character of madmen as well as assassins violent vindictive bloody and tyrannical without an object But may better counsels guide you  AGAIN and again revert to your old principlesseek peace and ensue itleave America if she has taxable matter in her to tax herself I am not here going into the distinctions of rights nor attempting to mark their boundaries I do not enter into these metaphysical distinctions I hate the very sound of them Leave the Americans as they antiently stood and these distinctions born of our unhappy contest will die along with it They and we and their and our ancestors have been happy under that system Let the memory of all actions in contradiction to that good old mode on both sides be extinguished for ever Be content to bind America by laws of trade you have always done it Let this be your reason for binding their trade Do not burthen them by taxes you were not used to do so from the beginning Let this be your reason for not taxing These are the arguments of states and kingdoms Leave the rest to the schools for there only they may be discussed with safety But if intemperately unwisely fatally you sophisticate and poison the very source of government by urging subtle deductions and consequences odious to those you govern from the unlimited and illimitable nature of supreme sovereignty you will teach them by these means to call that sovereignty  itself in question When you drive him hard the boar will surely turn upon the hunters If that sovereignty and their freedom cannot be reconciled which will they take They will cast your sovereignty in your face Nobody will be argued into slavery Sir let the gentlemen on the other side call forth all their ability let the best of them get up and tell me what one character of liberty the Americans have and what one brand of slavery they are free from if they are bound in their property and industry by all the restraints you can imagine on commerce and at the same time are made packhorses of every tax you choose to impose without the least share in granting them When they bear the burthens of unlimited monopoly will you bring them to bear the burthens of unlimited revenue too The Englishman in America will feel that this is slaverythat it is  legal  slavery will be no compensation either to his feelings or his understanding  A NOBLE Lord  Lord Carmarthen  who spoke some time ago is full of the fire of ingenuous youth and when he has modelled the ideas of a lively imagination by further experience he will be an ornament to his country in either house He has said that the Americans are our children and how can they revolt against their parent He says that if they are not free in their present state England is not free because Manchester and other considerable places are not represented So then because some towns in England are not represented America is to have no representative at all They are  "our children"  but when children ask for bread we are not to give a stone Is it because the natural resistance of things and the various mutations of time hinders our government or any scheme of government from being any more than a sort of approximation  to the right is it therefore that the colonies are to recede from it infinitely When this child of ours wishes to assimilate to its parent and to reflect with a true filial resemblance the beauteous countenance of British liberty are we to turn to them the shameful parts of our constitution are we to give them our weakness for their strength our opprobrium for their glory and the slough of slavery which we are not able to work off to serve them for their freedom  IF this be the case ask yourselves this question will they be content in such a state of slavery If not look to the consequences Reflect how you are to govern a people who think they ought to be free and think they are not Your scheme yields no revenue it yields nothing but discontent disorder disobedience and such is the state of America that after wading up to your eyes in blood you could only end just where you began that is to tax where no revenue is to be found tomy voice fails me my inclination indeed carries me no furtherall is confusion beyond it  WELL sir I have recovered a little and before I sit down I must say something to another point with which gentlemen urge us What is to be become of the declaratory act asserting the entireness of British legislative authority if we abandon the practice of taxation  FOR my part I look upon the rights stated in that act exactly in the manner in which I viewed them on its very first proposition and which I have often taken the liberty with great humility to lay before you I look I say on the imperial rights of Great Britain and the privileges which the colonists ought to enjoy under these rights to be just the most reconcilable things in the world  The parliament of Great Britain sits at the head of her extensive empire in two capacities one as the local legislature of this island providing for all things at home immediately and by no other instrument than the executive powerThe other and I think her nobler capacity is what I call her  imperial character  in which as from the throne of heaven she superintends all the several inferior legislatures and guides and controls them all without annihilating any As all these provincial legislatures are only coordinate to each other they ought all to be subordinate to her else they can neither preserve mutual peace nor hope for mutual justice nor effectually afford mutual assistance It is necessary to coerce the negligent to restrain the violent and to aid the weak and deficient by the overruling plenitude of her power She is never to intrude into the place of the others whilst they are equal to the common ends of their institution But in order to enable parliament to answer all these ends of provident and beneficent superintendance her powers must be boundless The gentlemen who think the powers of parliament limited may please themselves to talk of requisitions But suppose the requisitions are not obeyed What shall there be no reserved power in the empire to supply a deficiency which may weaken divide and dissipate the whole We are engaged in warthe secretary of state calls upon the colonies to contributesome would do it I think most would chearfully furnish whatever is demandedone or two suppose hang back and easing themselves let the stress of the draft lie on the otherssurely it is proper that some authority might legally say  "Tax yourselves for the common supply or parliament will do it for you"  This backwardness was as I am told actually the case of Pennsylvania for some short time towards  the beginning of the last war owing to some internal dissentions in the colony But whether the fact were so or otherwise the case is equally to be provided for by a competent sovereign power But then this ought to be no ordinary power nor ever used in the first instance This is what I meant when I have said at various times that I consider the power of taxing in parliament as an instrument of empire and not as a means of supply  SUCH sir is my idea of the constitution of the British empire as distinguished from the constitution of Britain and on these grounds I think subordination and liberty may be sufficiently reconciled through the whole whether to serve a refining speculatist or a factious demagogue I know not but enough surely for the ease and happiness of man  SIR whilst we held this happy course we drew more from the colonies than all the impotent violence of despotism ever could extort from them We did this abundantly in the last war It has never been once deniedand what reason have we to imagine that the colonies would not have proceeded in supplying government as liberally if you had not stepped in and hindered them from contributing by interrupting the channel in which their liberality flowed with so strong a course by attempting to take instead of being satisfied to receive Sir William Temple says that Holland has loaded itself with ten times the impositions which it revolted from Spain rather than submit to He says true Tyranny is a poor provider It knows neither how to accumulate nor how to extract  I CHARGE therefore to this new and unfortunate system the loss not only of peace of union and of  commerce but even of revenue which its friends are contending forIt is morally certain that we have lost at least a million of free grants since the peace I think we have lost a great deal more and that those who look for a revenue from the provinces never could have pursued even in that light a course more directly repugnant to their purposes  NOW sir I trust I have shewn first on that narrow ground which the hon gentleman measured that you are like to lose nothing by complying with the motion except what you have lost already I have shewn afterwards that in time of peace you flourished in commerce and when war required it had sufficient aid from the colonies while you pursued your antient policy that you threw every thing into confusion when you made the stampact and that you restored every thing to peace and order when you repealed it I have shewn that the revival of the system of taxation has produced the very worst effects and that the partial repeal has produced not partial good but universal evil Let these considerations founded on facts not one of which can be denied bring us back to your reason by the road of your experience  I CANNOT as I have said answer for mixed measures but surely this mixture of lenity would give the whole a better chance of success When you once regain confidence the way will be clear before you Then you may enforce the act of navigation when it ought to be enforced You will yourselves open it where it ought still further to be opened Proceed in what you do whatever you do from policy and not from rancour Let us act like men let us act like statesmen Let us hold some sort of consistent conductIt is agreed  that the revenue is not to be had in America If we lose the profit let us get rid of the odium  ON this business of America I confess I am serious even to sadness I have had but one opinion concerning it since I sat and before I sat in parliament The noble lord  Lord North  will as usual probably attribute the part taken by me and my friends in this business to a desire of getting his places Let him enjoy this happy and original idea If I deprived him of it I should take away most of his wit and all his argument But I had rather bear the brunt of all his wit and indeed blows much heavier than stand answerable to God for embracing a system that tends to the destruction of some of the very best and fairest of his works But I know the map of England as well as the noble lord  Lord North  or as any other person and I know that the way I take is not the road to preferment My excellent and honourable friend under me on the floor  Mr Dowdeswell  has trod that road with great toil for upwards of twenty years together He is not yet arrived at the noble lord's destination However the tracks of my worthy friend are those I have ever wished to follow because I know they lead to honour Long may we tread the same road together whoever may accompany us or whoever may laugh at us on our journey I honestly and solemnly declare I have in all seasons adhered to the system of for no other reason than that I think it laid deep in your truest interestsand that by limiting the exercise it fixes on the firmest foundations a real consistent wellgrounded authority in parliament Until you come back to that system there will be no peace for England  SPEECH TO THE ELECTORS ON HIS ARRIVAL AT BRISTOL AND AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE POLL  EDITOR'S ADVERTISEMENT  WE believe there is no need of an apology to the public for offering to them any genuine speeches of Mr Burke's The general approbation they met with from all parties at Bristol persuades us that a good edition of them will not be unacceptable which we own to be the inducement and we hope is a justification of our offering it  WE do not presume to descant on the merit of these speeches but as it is no less new than honourable to find a popular candidate at a popular election daring to avow his dissent to certain points that have been considered as very popular objects and maintaining himself on the manly confidence of his own opinion so we must say that it does great credit to the people of England as it proves to the world that to insure their confidence it is not necessary to flatter them or to affect a subserviency to their passions or their prejudices  IT may be necessary to premise that at the opening of the poll the candidates were lord Clare Mr Brickdale the two last members and Mr Cruger a considerable merchant at Bristol On the second day of the poll lord Clare declined and a considerable  body of gentlemen who had wished that the city of Bristol should at this critical season be represented by some gentleman of tried abilities and known commercial knowledge immediately put Mr Burke in nomination Some of them set off express for London to apprise that gentleman of this event but he was gone to Malton in Yorkshire The spirit and active zeal of these gentlemen followed him to Malton They arrived there just after Mr Burke's election for that place and invited him to Bristol  MR Burke as he tells us in his first speech acquainted his constituents with the honourable offer that was made him and with their consent he immediately set off for Bristol on the Tuesday at six in the evening he arrived at Bristol at half past two in the afternoon on Thursday the th of October being the sixth day of the poll  HE drove directly to the mayor's house who not being at home he proceeded to the Guildhall where he ascended the hustings and having saluted the electors the sheriffs and the two candidates he reposed himself for a few minutes and then addressed the electors in a speech which was received with great and universal applause and approbation  SPEECH ON HIS ARRIVAL AT BRISTOL  GENTLEMEN  I AM come hither to solicit in person that favour which my friends have hitherto endeavoured to procure for me by the most obliging and to me the most honourable exertions  I HAVE so high an opinion of the great trust which you have to confer on this occasion and by long experience so just a diffidence in my abilities to fill it in a manner adequate even to my own ideas that I should never have ventured of myself to intrude into that awful situation But since I am called upon by the desire of several respectable fellowsubjects as I have done at other times I give up my fears to their wishes Whatever my other deficiencies may be I do not know what it is to be wanting to my friends  I AM not fond of attempting to raise public expectation by great promises At this time there is much cause to consider and very little to presume We seem to be approaching to a great crisis in our affairs which calls for the whole wisdom of the wisest among us without being able to assure ourselves that any wisdom can preserve us from many and great inconveniencies You know I  speak of our unhappy contest with America I confess it is a matter on which I look down as from a precipice It is difficult in itself and it is rendered more intricate by a great variety of plans of conduct I do not mean to enter into them I will not suspect a want of good intention in framing them But however pure the intentions of their authors may have been we all know that the event has been unfortunate The means of recovering our affairs are not obvious So many great questions of commerce of finance of constitution and of policy are involved in this American deliberation that I dare engage for nothing but that I shall give it without any predilection to former opinions or any sinister bias whatsoever the most honest and impartial consideration of which I am capable The public has a full right to it and this great city a main pillar in the commercial interest of Great Britain must totter on its base by the slightest mistake with regard to our American measures  THUS much however I think it not amiss to lay before you That I am not I hope apt to take up or lay down my opinions lightly I have held and ever shall maintain to the best of my power unimpaired and undiminished the just wise and necessary constitutional superiority of GreatBritain This is necessary for America as well as for us I never mean to depart from it Whatever may be lost by it I avow it The forfeiture even of your favour if by such a declaration I could forfeit it though the first object of my ambition never will make me disguise my sentiments on this subject  BUTI have ever had a clear opinion and have ever held a constant correspondent conduct that this superiority is consistent with all the liberties a sober and spirited American ought to desire I never mean to put any colonist or any human  creature in a situation not becoming a freeman To reconcile British superiority with American liberty shall be my great object as far as my little faculties extend I am far from thinking that both even yet may not be preserved  WHEN I first devoted myself to the public service I considered how I should render myself fit for it and this I did by endeavouring to discover what it was that gave this country the rank it holds in the world I found that our prosperity and dignity arose principally if not solely from two sources our constitution and commerce Both these I have spared no study to understand and no endeavour to support  THE distinguishing part of our constitution is its liberty To preserve that liberty inviolate seems the particular duty and proper trust of a member of the house of commons But the liberty the only liberty I mean is a liberty connected with order that not only exists along with order and virtue but which cannot exist at all without them It inheres in good and steady government as in its substance and vital principle  THE other source of our power is commerce of which you are so large a part and which cannot exist no more than your liberty without a connection with many virtues It has ever been a very particular and a very favourite object of my study in its principles and in its details I think many here are acquainted with the truth of what I say This I know that I have ever had my house open and my poor services ready for traders and manufacturers of every denomination My favourite ambition is to have those services acknowledged I now appear before you to make trial whether my earnest endeavours have been so wholly oppressed  by the weakness of my abilities as to be rendered insignificant in the eyes of a great trading city or whether you chuse to give a weight to humble abilities for the sake of the honest exertions with which they are accompanied This is my trial today My industry is not on trial Of my industry I am sure as far as my constitution of mind and body admitted  WHEN I was invited by many respectable merchants freeholders and freemen of this city to offer them my services I had just received the honour of an election at another place at a very great distance from this I immediately opened the matter to those of my worthy constituents who were with me and they unanimously advised me not to decline it They told me that they had elected me with a view to the public service and as great questions relative to our commerce and colonies were imminent that in such matters I might derive authority and support from the representation of this great commercial city they desired me therefore to set off without delay very well persuaded that I never could forget my obligations to them or to my friends for the choice they had made of me From that time to this instant I have not slept and if I should have the honour of being freely chosen by you I hope I shall be as far from slumbering or sleeping when your service requires me to be awake as I have been in coming to offer myself a candidate for your favour  SPEECH TO THE ELECTORS OF BRISTOL ON Being declared by the Sheriffs duly elected one of the Representatives in Parliament for that City On Thursday the d of November  SPEECH AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE POLL  GENTLEMEN  I CANNOT avoid sympathizing strongly with the feelings of the gentleman who has received the same honour that you have conferred on me If he who was bred and passed his whole life amongst you if he who through the easy gradations of acquaintance friendship and esteem has obtained the honour which seems of itself naturally and almost insensibly to meet with those who by the even tenour of pleasing manners and social virtues slide into the love and confidence of their fellowcitizensif he cannot speak but with great emotion on this subject surrounded as he is on all sides with his old friends you will have the goodness to excuse me if my real unaffected embarrassment prevents me from expressing my gratitude to you as I ought  I WAS brought hither under the disadvantage of being unknown even by sight to any of you No previous canvass was made for me I was put in nomination after the poll was opened I did not appear until it was far advanced If under all these accumulated disadvantages your good opinion has carried me to this happy point of success you will pardon me if I can only say to you collectively as I said to you individually simply and  plainly I thank youI am obliged to youI am not insensible of your kindness  THIS is all that I am able to say for the inestimable favour you have conferred upon me But I cannot be satisfied without saying a little more in defence of the right you have to confer such a favour The person that appeared here as counsel for the candidate who so long and so earnestly solicited your votes thinks proper to deny that a very great part of you have any votes to give He fixes a standard period of time in his own imagination not what the law defines but merely what the convenience of his client suggests by which he would cut off at one stroke all those freedoms which are the dearest privileges of your corporation which the common law authorizes which your magistrates are compelled to grant which come duly authenticated into this court and are saved in the clearest words and with the most religious care and tenderness in that very act of parliament which was made to regulate the elections by freemen and to prevent all possible abuses in making them  I DO not intend to argue the matter here My learned counsel has supported your cause with his usual ability the worthy sheriffs have acted with their usual equity and I have no doubt that the same equity which dictates the return will guide the final determination I had the honour in conjunction with many far wiser men to contribute a very small assistance but however some assistance to the forming the judicature which is to try such questions It would be unnatural in me to doubt the justice of that court in the trial of my own cause to which I have been so active to give jurisdiction over every other  I ASSURE the worthy freemen and this corporation that if the gentleman perseveres in the intentions which his present warmth dictates to him I will attend their cause with diligence and I hope with effect For if I know any thing of myself it is not my own interest in it but my full conviction that induces me to tell you  I think there is not a shadow of doubt in the case    I DO not imagine that you find me rash in declaring myself or very forward in troubling you From the beginning to the end of the election I have kept silence in all matters of discussion I have never asked a question of a voter on the other side or supported a doubtful vote on my own I respected the abilities of my managers I relied on the candour of the court I think the worthy sheriffs will bear me witness that I have never once made an attempt to impose upon their reason to surprize their justice or to ruffle their temper I stood on the hustings except when I gave my thanks to those who favoured me with their votes less like a candidate than an unconcerned spectator of a public proceeding But here the face of things is altered Here is an attempt for a general  massacre  of suffrages an attempt by a promiscuous carnage of  friends  and  foes  to exterminate above two thousand votes including  seven hundred polled for the gentleman himself who now complains  and who would destroy the friends whom he has obtained only because he cannot obtain as many of them as he wishes  HOW he will be permitted in another place to stultify and disable himself and to plead against his own acts is another question The law will decide it I shall only speak of it as it concerns the propriety of public conduct in this city I do not pretend to lay down rules of decorum for other gentlemen  They are best judges of the mode of proceeding that will recommend them to the favour of their fellowcitizens But I confess I should look rather aukward if I had been the  very first to produce the new copies of freedom  if I had persisted in producing them to the last if I had ransacked with the most unremitting industry and the most penetrating research the remotest corners of the kingdom to discover them if I were then all at once to turn short and declare that I had been sporting all this while with the right of election and that I had been drawing out a poll upon no sort of rational grounds which disturbed the peace of my fellowcitizens for a month togetherI really for my part should appear aukward under such circumstances  IT would be still more aukward in me if I were gravely to look the sheriffs in the face and to tell them they were not to determine my cause on my own principles nor to make the return upon those votes upon which I had rested my election Such would be my appearance to the court and magistrates  BUT how should I appear to the  Voters  themselves If I had gone round to the citizens intitled to freedom and squeezed them by the hand  "Sir I humbly beg your voteI shall be eternally thankfulmay I hope for the honour of your supportWellcomewe shall see you at the councilhouse"  If I were then to deliver them to my managers pack them into tallies vote them off in court and when I heard from the bar  "Such a one only and such a one for everhe's my man""Thank you good sirHah my worthy friend thank you kindlythat's an honest fellowhow is your good family"  Whilst these words were  hardly out of my mouth if I should have wheeled round at once and told them  "Get you gone you pack of worthless fellows you have no votesyou are usurpers you are intruders on the rights of real freemen I will have nothing to do with you you ought never to have been produced at this election and the sheriffs ought not to have admitted you to poll"  GENTLEMEN I should make a strange figure if my conduct had been of this sort I am not so old an acquaintance of yours as the worthy gentleman Indeed I could not have ventured on such kind of freedoms with you But I am bound and I will endeavour to have justice done to the rights of freemen even though I should at the same time be obliged to vindicate the former  Mr Brickdale opened his poll it seems with a tally of those very kind of freemen and voted many hundreds of them  part of my antagonist's conduct against his own present inclinations  I OWE myself in all things to  all  the freemen of this city My particular friends have a demand on me that I should not deceive their expectations Never was cause or man supported with more constancy more activity more spirit I have been supported with a zeal indeed and heartiness in my friends which if their object had been at all proportioned to their endeavours could never be sufficiently commended They supported me upon the most liberal principles They wished that the members for Bristol should be chosen for the city and for their country at large and not for themselves  SO far they are not disappointed If I possess nothing else I am sure I possess the temper that is  fit for your service I know nothing of Bristol but by the favours I have received and the virtues I have seen exerted in it  I SHALL ever retain what I now feel the most perfect and grateful attachment to my friendsand I have no enmities no resentment I never can consider fidelity to engagements and constancy in friendships but with the highest approbation even when those noble qualities are employed against my own pretensions The gentleman who is not fortunate as I have been in this contest enjoys in this respect a consolation full of honour both to himself and to his friends They have certainly left nothing undone for his service  AS for the trifling petulance which the rage of party stirs up in little minds though it should shew itself even in this court it has not made the slightest impression on me The highest flight of such clamorous birds is winged in an inferior region of the air We hear them and we look upon them just as you gentlemen when you enjoy the serene air on your lofty rocks look down upon the gulls that skim the mud of your river when it is exhausted of its tide  I AM sorry I cannot conclude without saying a word on a topic touched upon by my worthy colleague I wish that topic had been passed by at a time when I have so little leisure to discuss it But since he has thought proper to throw it out I owe you a clear explanation of my poor sentiments on that subject  HE tells you that  "the topic of instructions has occasioned much altercation and uneasiness in this city"  and he expresses himself if I understand him rightly in favour of the coercive authority of such instructions  CERTAINLY gentlemen it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union the closest correspondence and the most unreserved communication with his constituents Their wishes ought to have great weight with him their opinion high respect their business unremitted attention It is his duty to sacrifice his repose his pleasures his satisfactions to theirs and above all ever and in all cases to prefer their interest to his own But his unbiassed opinion his mature judgment his enlightened conscience he ought not to sacrifice to you to any man or to any set of men living These he does not derive from your pleasure no nor from the law and the constitution They are a trust from Providence for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable Your representative owes you not his industry only but his judgment and he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion  MY worthy colleague says his will ought to be subservient to yours If that be all the thing is innocent If government were a matter of will upon any side yours without question ought to be superior But government and legislation are matters of reason and judgment and not of inclination and what sort of reason is that in which the determination precedes the discussion in which one set of men deliberate and another decide and where those who form the conclusion are perhaps three hundred miles distant from those who hear the arguments  TO deliver an opinion is the right of all men that of constituents is a weighty and respectable opinion which a representative ought always to rejoice to hear and which he ought always most seriously to consider But  authoritative  instructions  mandates  issued which the member is bound blindly and implicitly to obey to vote and to argue for though contrary to the clearest conviction of his judgment and conscience these are things utterly unknown to the laws of this land and which arise from a fundamental mistake of the whole order and tenour of our constitution  PARLIAMENT is not a  congress  of ambassadors from different and hostile interests which interests each must maintain as an agent and advocate against other agents and advocates but parliament is a  deliberative  assembly of  one  nation with  one  interest that of the whole where not local purposes not local prejudices ought to guide but the general good resulting from the general reason of the whole You chuse a member indeed but when you have chosen him he is not member of Bristol but he is a member of  parliament  If the local constituent should have an interest or should form an hasty opinion evidently opposite to the real good of the rest of the community the member for that place ought to be as far as any other from any endeavour to give it effect I beg pardon for saving so much on this subject I have been unwillingly drawn into it but I shall ever use a respectful frankness of communication with you Your faithful friend your devoted servant I shall be to the end of my life a flatterer you do not wish for On this point of instructions however I think it scarcely possible we ever can have any sort of difference Perhaps I may give you too much rather than too little trouble  FROM the first hour I was encouraged to court your favour to this happy day of obtaining it I have never promised you any thing but humble and persevering endeavours to do my duty The weight of that duty I confess makes me tremble and whoever well considers what it is of all things  in the world will fly from what has the least likeness to a positive and precipitate engagement To be a good member of parliament is let me tell you no easy task especially at this time when there is so strong a disposition to run into the perilous extremes of servile compliance or wild popularity To unite circumspection with vigour is absolutely necessary but it is extremely difficult We are now members for a rich commercial  city  this city however is but a part of a rich commercial  nation  the interests of which are various multiform and intricate We are members for that great  nation  which however is itself but part of a great  empire  extended by our virtue and our fortune to the farthest limits of the east and of the west All these widespread interests must be considered must be compared must be reconciled if possible We are members for a  free  country and surely we all know that the machine of a free constitution is no simple thing but as intricate and as delicate as it is valuable We are members in a great and ancient  monarchy  and we must preserve religiously the true legal rights of the sovereign which form the keystone that binds together the noble and wellconstructed arch of our empire and our constitution A constitution made up of balanced powers must ever be a critical thing As such I mean to touch that part of it which comes within my reach I know my inability and I wish for support from every quarter In particular I shall aim at the friendship and shall cultivate the best correspondence of the worthy colleague you have given me  I TROUBLE you no farther than once more to thank you all you gentlemen for your favours the candidates for their temperate and polite behaviour and the sheriffs for a conduct which may give a model for all who are in public stations  SPEECH ON MOVING HIS RESOLUTIONS FOR A CONCILIATION WITH THE COLONIES MARCH  SPEECH FOR A CONCILIATION WITH THE COLONIES  I HOPE sir that notwithstanding the austerity of the chair your goodnature will incline you to some degree of indulgence towards human frailty You will not think it unnatural that those who have an object depending which strongly engages their hopes and fears should be somewhat inclined to superstition As I came into the house full of anxiety about the event of my motion I found to my infinite surprize that the grand penal bill by which we had passed sentence on the trade and sustenance of America is to be returned to us from the other house  "The act to restrain the trade and commerce of the provinces of Massachuset's Bay and New Hampshire and colonies of Connecticut and Rhode Island and Providence Plantation in North America to Great Britain Ireland and the British Islands in the West Indies and to prohibit such provinces and colonies from carrying on any fishery on the banks of Newfoundland and other places therein mentioned under certain conditions and limitations"  I do confess I could not help looking on this event as a fortunate omen I look upon it as a sort of providential favour by which we are put once more in possession of our deliberative capacity upon a business so very questionable in its nature so very uncertain in its issue By the return of this bill which seemed to have taken its flight for ever  we are at this very instant nearly as free to chuse a plan for our American government as we were on the first day of the session If sir we incline to the side of conciliation we are not at all embarrassed unless we please to make ourselves so by any incongruous mixture of coercion and restraint We are therefore called upon as it were by a superior warning voice again to attend to America to attend to the whole of it together and to review the subject with an unusual degree of care and calmness  SURELY it is an awful subject or there is none so on this side of the grave When I first had the honour of a seat in this house the affairs of that continent pressed themselves upon us as the most important and most delicate object of parliamentary attention My little share in this great deliberation oppressed me I found myself a partaker in a very high trust and having no sort of reason to rely on the strength of my natural abilities for the proper execution of that trust I was obliged to take more than common pains to instruct myself in every thing which relates to our colonies I was not less under the necessity of forming some fixed ideas concerning the general policy of the British Empire Something of this sort seemed to be indispensable in order amidst so vast a fluctuation of passions and opinions to concenter my thoughts to ballast my conduct to preserve me from being blown about by every wind of fashionable doctrine I really did not think it safe or manly to have fresh principles to seek upon every fresh mail which should arive from America  AT that period I had the fortune to find myself in perfect concurrence with a large majority in this house Bowing under that high authority and penetrated with the sharpness and strength of that  early impression I have continued ever since without the least deviation in my original sentiments Whether this be owing to an obstinate perseverance in error or to a religious adherence to what appears to me truth and reason it is in your equity to judge  SIR parliament having an enlarged view of objects made during this interval more frequent changes in their sentiments and their conduct than could be justified in a particular person upon the contracted scale of private information But though I do not hazard any thing approaching to a censure on the motives of former parliaments to all those alterations one fact is undoubted that under them the state of America has been kept in continual agitation Every thing administered as remedy to the public complaint if it did not produce was at least followed by an heightening of the distemper until by a variety of experiments that important country has been brought into her present situationa situation which I will not miscall which I dare not name which I scarcely know how to comprehend in the terms of any description  IN this posture sir things stood at the beginning of the session About that time a worthy member  Mr Rose Fuller  of great parliamentary experience who in the year filled the chair of the American committee with much ability took me aside and lamenting the present aspect of our politics told me things were come to such a pass that our former methods of proceeding in the house would be no longer tolerated That the public tribunal never too indulgent to a long and unsuccessful opposition would now scrutinize our conduct with unusual severity That the very vicissitudes and shiftings of ministerial  measures instead of convicting their authors of inconstancy and want of system would be taken as an occasion of charging us with a predetermined discontent which nothing could satisfy whilst we accused every measure of vigour as cruel and every proposal of lenity as weak and irresolute The public he said would not have patience to see us play the game out with our adversaries we must produce our hand It would be expected that those who for many years had been active in such affairs should shew that they had formed some clear and decided idea of the principles of colony government and were capable of drawing out something like a platform of the ground which might be laid for future and permanent tranquillity  I FELT the truth of what my hon friend represented but I felt my situation too His application might have been made with far greater propriety to many other gentlemen No man was indeed ever better disposed or worse qualified for such an undertaking than myself Though I gave so far into his opinion that I immediately threw my thoughts into a sort of parliamentary form I was by no means equally ready to produce them It generally argues some degree of natural impotence of mind or some want of knowledge of the world to hazard plans of government except from a seat of authority Propositions are made not only ineffectually but somewhat disreputably when the minds of men are not properly disposed for their reception and for my part I am not ambitious of ridicule not absolutely a candidate for disgrace  BESIDES sir to speak the plain truth I have in general no very exalted opinion of the virtue of paper government nor of any politics in which the plan is to be wholly separated from the execution  But when I saw that anger and violence prevailed every day more and more and that things were hastening towards an incurable alienation of our colonies I confess my caution gave way I felt this as one of those few moments in which decorum yields to an higher duty Public calamity is a mighty leveller and there are occasions when any even the slightest chance of doing good must be laid hold on even by the most inconsiderable person  TO restore order and repose to an empire so great and so distracted as ours is merely in the attempt an undertaking that would ennoble the flights of the highest genius and obtain pardon for the efforts of the meanest understanding Struggling a good while with these thoughts by degrees I felt myself more firm I derived at length some confidence from what in other circumstances usually produces timidity I grew less anxious even from the idea of my own insignificance For judging of what you are by what you ought to be I persuaded myself that you would not reject a reasonable proposition because it had nothing but its reason to recommend it On the other hand being totally destitute of all shadow of influence natural or adventitious I was very sure that if my proposition were futile or dangerous if it were weakly conceived or improperly timed there was nothing exterior to it of power to awe dazzle or delude you You will see it just as it is and you will treat it just as it deserves  THE proposition is peace Not peace through the medium of war not peace to be hunted through the labyrinth of intricate and endless negociations not peace to arise out of universal discord fomented from principle in all parts of the empire not peace to depend on the juridical determination  of perplexing questions or the precise marking the shadowy boundaries of a complex government It is simple peace sought in its natural course and its ordinary hauntsIt is peace sought in the spirit of peace and laid in principles purely pacific I propose by removing the ground of the difference and by restoring the  former unsuspecting confidence of the colonies in the mother country  to give permanent satisfaction to your people and far from a scheme of ruling by discord to reconcile them to each other in the same act and by the bond of the very same interest which reconciles them to British government  MY idea is nothing more Refined policy ever has been the parent of confusion and ever will be so as long as the world endures Plain good intention which is as easily discovered at the first view as fraud is surely detected at last is let me say of no mean force in the government of mankind Genuine simplicity of heart is an healing and cementing principle My plan therefore being formed upon the most simple grounds imaginable may disappoint some people when they hear it It has nothing to recommend it to the pruriency of curious ears There is nothing at all new and captivating in it It has nothing of the splendour of the project which has been lately laid upon your table by the noble lord in the blue ribband  "That when the governor council or assembly or general court of any of his majesty's provinces or colonies in America shall  propose  to make provision  according to the condition circumstances  and  situation  of such province or colony for contributing their  proportion  to the  common defence  such  proportion  to be raised under the authority of the general court or general assembly of such province or colony and disposable by parliament and shall  engage  to make provision also for the support of the civil government and the administration of justice in such province or colony it will be proper  if such proposal shall be approved by his majesty and the two houses of parliament  and for so long as such provision shall be made accordingly to forbear  in respect of such province or colony  to levy any duty tax or assessment or to impose any farther duty tax or assessment except such duties as it may be expedient to continue to levy or impose for the regulation of commerce the nett produce of the duties last mentioned to be carried to the account of such province or colony respectively"  Resolution moved by lord North in the committee and agreed to by the house Feb  It does not propose to fill your lobby  with squabbling colony agents who will require the interposition of your mace at every instant to keep the peace amongst them It does not institute a magnificent auction of finance where captivated provinces come to general ransom by bidding against each other until you knock down the hammer and determine a proportion of payments beyond all the powers of algebra to equalize and settle  THE plan which I shall presume to suggest derives however one great advantage from the proposition and registry of that noble lord's project The idea of conciliation is admissible First the house in accepting the resolution moved by the noble lord has admitted notwithstanding the menacing front of our address notwithstanding our heavy bill of pains and penaltiesthat we do not think ourselves precluded from all ideas of free grace and bounty  THE house has gone farther it has declared conciliation admissible  previous  to any submission on the part of America It has even shot a good deal beyond that mark and has admitted that the complaints of our former mode of exerting the right of taxation were not wholly unfounded That right thus exerted is allowed to have had something reprehensible in it something unwise or something  grievous since in the midst of our heat and resentment we of ourselves have proposed a capital alteration and in order to get rid of what seemed so very exceptionable have instituted a mode that is altogether new one that is indeed wholly alien from all the ancient methods and forms of parliament  THE  principle  of this proceeding is large enough for my purpose The means proposed by the noble lord for carrying his ideas into execution I think indeed are very indifferently suited to the end and this I shall endeavour to shew you before I sit down But for the present I take my ground on the admitted principle I mean to give peace Peace implies reconciliation and where there has been a material dispute reconciliation does in a manner always imply concession on the one part or on the other In this state of things I make no difficulty in affirming that the proposal ought to originate from us Great and acknowledged force is not impaired either in effect or in opinion by an unwillingness to exert itself The superior power may offer peace with honour and with safety Such an offer from such a power will be attributed to magnanimity But the concessions of the weak are the concessions of fear When such a one is disarmed he is wholly at the mercy of his superior and he loses for ever that time and those chances which as they happen to all men are the strength and resources of all inferior power  THE capital leading questions on which you must this day decide are these two First whether you ought to concede and secondly what your concession ought to be On the first of these questions we have gained as I have just taken the liberty of observing to you some ground But I am sensible that a good deal more is still to be  done Indeed sir to enable us to determine both on the one and the other of these great questions with a firm and precise judgment I think it may be necessary to consider distinctly the true nature and the peculiar circumstances of the object which we have before us Because after all our struggle whether we will or not we must govern America according to that nature and to those circumstances and not according to our own imaginations not according to abstract ideas of right by no means according to mere general theories of government the resort to which appears to me in our present situation no better than arrant trifling I shall therefore endeavour with your leave to lay before you some of the most material of these circumstances in as full and as clear a manner as I am able to state them  THE first thing that we have to consider with regard to the nature of the object isthe number of people in the colonies I have taken for some years a good deal of pains on that point I can by no calculation justify myself in placing the number below two millions of inhabitants of our own European blood and colour besides at least others who form no inconsiderable part of the strength and opulence of the whole This sir is I believe about the true number There is no occasion to exaggerate where plain truth is of so much weight and importance But whether I put the present numbers too high or too low is a matter of little moment Such is the strength with which population shoots in that part of the world that state the numbers as high as we will whilst the dispute continues the exaggeration ends Whilst we are discussing any given magnitude they are grown to it Whilst we spend our time in deliberating on the mode of governing two millions  we shall find we have millions more to manage Your children do not grow faster from infancy to manhood than they spread from families to communities and from villages to nations  I PUT this consideration of the present and the growing numbers in the front of our deliberation because sir this consideration will make it evident to a blunter discernment than yours that no partial narrow contracted pinched occasional system will be at all suitable to such an object It will shew you that it is not to be considered as one of those  minima  which are out of the eye and consideration of the law not a paltry excrescence of the state not a mean dependant who may be neglected with little damage and provoked with little danger It will prove that some degree of care and caution is required in the handling such an object it will shew that you ought not in reason to trifle with so large a mass of the interests and feelings of the human race You could at no time do so without guilt and be assured you will not be able to do it long with impunity  BUT the population of this country the great and growing population though a very important consideration will lose much of its weight if not combined with other circumstances The commerce of your colonies is out of all proportion beyond the numbers of the people This ground of their commerce indeed has been trod some days ago and with great ability by a distinguished  Mr Glover  person at your bar This gentleman after thirtyfive yearsit is so long since he first appeared at the same place to plead for the commerce of Great Britainhas come again before you to plead the same cause without any other effect of time than that to the fire of imagination and extent of  erudition which even then marked him as one of the first literary characters of his age he has added a consummate knowledge in the commercial interest of his country formed by a long course of enlightened and discriminating experience  SIR I should be inexcusable in coming after such a person with any detail if a great part of the members who now fill the house had not the misfortune to be absent when he appeared at your bar Besides sir I propose to take the matter at periods of time somewhat different from his There is if I mistake not a point of view from whence if you will look at this subject it is impossible that it should not make an impression upon you  I HAVE in my hand two accounts one a comparative state of the export trade of England to its colonies as it stood in the year and as it stood in the year The other a state of the export trade of this country to its colonies alone as it stood in compared with the whole trade of England to all parts of the world the colonies included in the year They are from good vouchers the latter period from the accounts on your table the earlier from an original manuscript of Davenant who first established the inspector general's office which has been ever since his time so abundant a source of parliamentary information  THE export trade to the colonies consists of three great branches The African which terminating almost wholly in the colonies must be put to the account of their commerce the West Indian and the North American All these are so interwoven that the attempt to separate them would tear to pieces the contexture of the whole and if not entirely destroy would very much depreciate  the value of all the parts I therefore consider these three denominations to be what in effect they are one trade  THE trade to the colonies taken on the export side at the beginning of this century that is in the year stood thus        £  Exports to North America and the West Indies       To Africa          £    In the year which I take as a middle year between the highest and lowest of those lately laid on your table the account was as follows        £  To North America and the West Indies       To Africa       To which if you add the export trade from Scotland which had in no existence          £    FROM five hundred and odd thousand it has grown to six millions It has increased no less than twelvefold This is the state of the colony trade as compared with itself at these two periods within this centuryand this is matter for meditation But this is not all Examine my second account See how the export trade to the colonies alone in stood in the other point of view that is as compared to the whole trade of England in        £  The whole export trade of England including that to the colonies in       Export to the colonies alone in          Difference    THE trade with America alone is now within less than l of being equal to what this great commercial nation England carried on at the beginning of this century with the whole world If I had taken the largest year of those on your table it would rather have exceeded But it will be said is not this American trade an unnatural protuberance that has drawn the juices from the rest of the body The reverse It is the very food that has nourished every other part into its present magnitude Our general trade has been greatly augmented and augmented more or less in almost every part to which it ever extended but with this material difference that of the six millions which in the beginning of the century constituted the whole mass of our export commerce the colony trade was but one twelfth part it is now as a part of sixteen millions considerably more than a third of the whole This is the relative proportion of the importance of the colonies at these two periods and all reasoning concerning our mode of treating them must have this proportion as its basis or it is a reasoning weak rotten and sophistical  MR SPEAKER I cannot prevail on myself to hurry over this great consideration It is good for us to be here We stand where we have an immense view of what is and what is past Clouds indeed and darkness rest upon the future Let us however before we descend from this noble  eminence reflect that this growth of our national prosperity has happened within the short period of the life of man It has happened within sixtyeight years There are those alive whose memory might touch the two extremities For instance my lord Bathurst might remember all the stages of the progress He was in of an age at least to be made to comprehend such things He was then old enough  acta parentum jam legere et quae sit poterit cognoscere virtus  Suppose sir that the angel of this auspicious youth foreseeing the many virtues which made him one of the most amiable as he is one of the most fortunate men of his age had opened to him in vision that when in the fourth generation the third prince of the house of Brunswick had sat twelve years on the throne of that nation which by the happy issue of moderate and healing councils was to be made Great Britain he should see his son lord chancellor of England turn back the current of hereditary dignity to its fountain and raise him to an higher rank of peerage whilst he enriched the family with a new oneIf amidst these bright and happy scenes of domestic honour and prosperity that angel should have drawn up the curtain and unfolded the rising glories of his country and whilst he was gazing with admiration on the then commercial grandeur of England the genius should point out to him a little speck scarce visible in the mass of the national interest a small seminal principle rather than a formed body and should tell him  "Young man There is Americawhich at this day serves for little more than to amuse you with stories of savage men and uncouth manners yet shall before you taste of death shew itself equal to the whole of that commerce which now attracts the envy of the world Whatever England has been growing  to by a progressive increase of improvement brought in by varieties of people by succession of civilizing conquests and civilizing settlements in a series of seventeen hundred years you shall see as much added to her by America in the course of a single life"  If this state of his country had been foretold to him would it not require all the sanguine credulity of youth and all the fervid glow of enthusiasm to make him believe it Fortunate man he has lived to see it Fortunate indeed if he lives to see nothing that shall vary the prospect and cloud the setting of his day  EXCUSE me sir if turning from such thoughts I resume this comparative view once more You have seen it on a large scale look at it on a small one I will point out to your attention a particular instance of it in the single province of Pensylvania In the year that province called for l in value of your commodities native and foreign This was the whole What did it demand in Why nearly fifty times as much for in that year the export to Pensylvania was l nearly equal to the export to all the colonies together in the first period  I CHOOSE sir to enter into these minute and particular details because generalities which in all other cases are apt to heighten and raise the subject have here a tendency to sink it When we speak of the commerce with our colonies fiction lags after truth invention is unfruitful and imagination cold and barren  So far sir as to the importance of the object in the view of its commerce as concerned in the exports from England If I were to detail the imports I could shew how many enjoyments they  procure which deceive the burthen of life how many materials which invigorate the springs of national industry and extend and animate every part of our foreign and domestic commerce This would be a curious subject indeedbut I must prescribe bounds to myself in a matter so vast and various  I PASS therefore to the colonies in another point of view their agriculture This they have prosecuted with such a spirit that besides feeding plentifully their own growing multitude their annual export of grain comprehending rice has some years ago exceeded a million in value Of their last harvest I am persuaded they will export much more At the beginning of the century some of these colonies imported corn from the mother country For some time past the old world has been fed from the new The scarcity which you have felt would have been a desolating famine if this child of your old age with a true filial piety with a Roman charity had not put the full breast of its youthful exuberance to the mouth of its exhausted parent  AS to the wealth which the colonies have drawn from the sea by their fisheries you had all that matter fully opened at your bar You surely thought those acquisitions of value for they seemed even to excite your envy and yet the spirit by which that enterprizing employment has been exercised ought rather in my opinion to have raised your esteem and admiration And pray sir what in the world is equal to it Pass by the other parts and look at the manner in which the people of New England have of late carried on the whale fishery Whilst we follow them among the jumbling mountains of ice and behold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses of Hudson's  Bay and Davis's Streights whilst we are looking for them beneath the Arctic circle we hear that they have pierced into the opposite region of polar cold that they are at the Antipodes and engaged under the frozen serpent of the south Falkland Island which seemed too remote and romantic an object for the grasp of national ambition is but a stage and restingplace in the progress of their victorious industry Nor is the equinoctial heat more discouraging to them than the accumulated winter of both the poles We know that whilst some of them draw the line and strike the harpoon on the coast of Africa others run the longitude and pursue their gigantic game along the coast of Brazil No sea but what is vexed by their fisheries No climate that is not witness to their toils Neither the perseverance of Holland nor the activity of France nor the dextrous and firm sagacity of English enterprize ever carried this most perilous mode of hardy industry to the extent to which it has been pushed by this recent people a people who are still as it were but in the gristle and not yet hardened into the bone of manhood When I contemplate these things when I know that the colonies in general owe little or nothing to any care of ours and that they are not squeezed into this happy form by the constraints of watchful and suspicious government but that through a wise and salutary neglect a generous nature has been suffered to take her own way to perfection when I reflect upon these effects when I see how profitable they have been to us I feel all the pride of power sink and all presumption in the wisdom of human contrivances melt and die away within me My rigour relents I pardon something to the spirit of liberty  I AM sensible sir that all which I have asserted in my detail is admitted in the gross but that  quite a different conclusion is drawn from it America gentlemen say is a noble object It is an object well worth fighting for Certainly it is if fighting a people be the best way of gaining them Gentlemen in this respect will be led to their choice of means by their complexions and their habits Those who understand the military art will of course have some predilection for it Those who wield the thunder of the state may have more confidence in the efficacy of arms But I confess possibly for want of this knowledge my opinion is much more in favour of prudent management than of force considering force not as an odious but a feeble instrument for preserving a people so numerous so active so growing so spirited as this in a profitable and subordinate connexion with us  FIRST sir permit me to observe that the use of force alone is but  temporary  It may subdue for a moment but it does not remove the necessity of subduing again and a nation is not governed which is perpetually to be conquered  MY next objection is its  uncertainty  Terror is not always the effect of force and an armament is not a victory If you do not succeed you are without resource for conciliation failing force remains but force failing no further hope of reconciliation is rest Power and authority are sometimes bought by kindness but they can never be begged as alms by an impoverished and defeated violence  A FURTHER objection to force is that you  impair the object  by your very endeavours to preserve it The thing you fought for is not the thing which you recover but depreciated sunk wasted and consumed in the contest Nothing less will content me than  whole America  I do not choose  to consume its strength along with our own because in all parts it is the British strength that I consume I do not choose to be caught by a foreign enemy at the end of this exhausting conflict and still less in the midst of it I may escape but I can make no insurance against such an event Let me add that I do not choose wholly to break the American spirit because it is the spirit that has made the country  LASTLY we have no sort of  experience  in favour of force as an instrument in the rule of our colonies Their growth and their utility has been owing to methods altogether different Our ancient indulgence has been said to be pursued to a fault It may be so But we know if feeling is evidence that our fault was more tolerable than our attempt to mend it and our sin far more salutary than our penitence  THESE sir are my reasons for not entertaining that high opinion of untried force by which many gentlemen for whose sentiments in other particulars I have great respect seem to be so greatly captivated But there is still behind a third consideration concerning this object which serves to determine my opinion on the sort of policy which ought to be pursued in the management of America even more than its population and its commerce I mean its  temper and character    IN this character of the Americans a love of freedom is the predominating feature which marks and distinguishes the whole and as an ardent is always a jealous affection your colonies become suspicious restive and untractable whenever they see the least attempt to wrest from them by force or shuffle from them by chicane what they think the only advantage worth living for This fierce spirit  of liberty is stronger in the English colonies probably than in any other people of the earth and this from a great variety of powerful causes which to understand the true temper of their minds and the direction which this spirit takes it will not be amiss to lay open somewhat more largely  FIRST the people of the colonies are descendents of Englishmen England sir is a nation which still I hope respects and formerly adored her freedom The colonists emigrated from you when this part of your character was most predominant and they took this biass and direction the moment they parted from your hands They are therefore not only devoted to liberty but to liberty according to English ideas and on English principles Abstract liberty like other mere abstractions is not to be found Liberty inheres in some sensible object and every nation has formed to itself some favourite point which by way of eminence becomes the criterion of their happiness It happened you know sir that the great contests for freedom in this country were from the earliest times chiefly upon the question of taxing Most of the contests in the ancient commonwealths turned primarily on the right of election of magistrates or on the balance among the several orders of the state The question of money was not with them so immediate But in England it was otherwise On this point of taxes the ablest pens and most eloquent tongues have been exercised the greatest spirits have acted and suffered In order to give the fullest satisfaction concerning the importance of this point it was not only necessary for those who in argument defended the excellence of the English constitution to insist on this privilege of granting money as a dry point of fact and to prove that the right had been acknowledged in ancient parchments  and blind usages to reside in a certain body called an house of commons They went much further they attempted to prove and they succeeded that in theory it ought to be so from the particular nature of a house of commons as an immediate representative of the people whether the old records had delivered this oracle or not They took infinite pains to inculcate as a fundamental principle that in all monarchies the people must in effect themselves mediately or immediately possess the power of granting their own money or no shadow of liberty could subsist The colonies draw from you as with their lifeblood these ideas and principles Their love of liberty as with you fixed and attached on this specific point of taxing Liberty might be safe or might be endangered in twenty other particulars without their being much pleased or alarmed Here they felt its pulse and as they found that beat they thought themselves sick or sound I do not say whether they were right or wrong in applying your general arguments to their own case It is not easy indeed to make a monopoly of theorems and corollaries The fact is that they did thus apply those general arguments and your mode of governing them whether through lenity or indolence through wisdom or mistake confirmed them in the imagination that they as well as you had an interest in these common principles  THEY were further confirmed in this pleasing error by the form of their provincial legislative assemblies Their governments are popular in an high degree some are merely popular in all the popular representative is the most weighty and this share of the people in their ordinary government never fails to inspire them with lofty sentiments and with a strong aversion from whatever tends to deprive them of their chief importance  IF any thing were wanting to this necessary operation of the form of government religion would have given it a complete effect Religion always a principle of energy in this new people is no way worn out or impaired and their mode of professing it is also one main cause of this free spirit The people are protestants and of that kind which is the most adverse to all implicit submission of mind and opinion This is a persuasion not only favourable to liberty but built upon it I do not think sir that the reason of this averseness in the dissenting churches from all that looks like absolute government is so much to be sought in their religious tenets as in their history Every one knows that the Roman Catholic religion is at least coeval with most of the governments where it prevails that it has generally gone hand in hand with them and received great favour and every kind of support from authority The church of England too was formed from her cradle under the nursing care of regular government But the dissenting interests have sprung up in direct opposition to all the ordinary powers of the world and could justify that opposition only on a strong claim to natural liberty Their very existence depended on the powerful and unremitted assertion of that claim All protestantism even the most cold and passive is a sort of dissent But the religion most prevalent in our northern colonies is a refinement on the principle of resistance it is the dissidence of dissent and the protestantism of the protestant religion This religion under a variety of denominations agreeing in nothing but in the communion of the spirit of liberty is predominant in most of the northern provinces where the church of England notwithstanding its legal rights is in reality no more than a sort of private sect not composing most probably the tenth of the people The colonists left England  when this spirit was high and in the emigrants was the highest of all and even that stream of foreigners which has been constantly flowing into these colonies has for the greatest part been composed of dissenters from the establishments of their several countries and have brought with them a temper and character far from alien to that of the people with whom they mixed  SIR I can perceive by their manner that some gentlemen object to the latitude of this description because in the southern colonies the church of England forms a large body and has a regular establishment It is certainly true There is however a circumstance attending these colonies which in my opinion fully counterbalances this difference and makes the spirit of liberty still more high and haughty than in those to the northward It is that in Virginia and the Carolinas they have a vast multitude of slaves Where this is the case in any part of the world those who are free are by far the most proud and jealous of their freedom Freedom is to them not only an enjoyment but a kind of rank and privilege Not seeing there that freedom as in countries where it is a common blessing and as broad and general as the air may be united with much abject toil with great misery with all the exterior of servitude liberty looks amongst them like something that is more noble and liberal I do not mean sir to commend the superior morality of this sentiment which has at least as much pride as virtue in it but I cannot alter the nature of man The fact is so and these people of the southern colonies are much more strongly and with an higher and more stubborn spirit attached to liberty than those to the northward Such were all the ancient commonwealths such were our Gothic ancestors such in our days were the Poles  and such will be all masters of slaves who are not slaves themselves In such a people the haughtiness of domination combines with the spirit of freedom fortifies it and renders it invincible  PERMIT me sir to add another circumstance in our colonies which contributes no mean part towards the growth and effect of this untractable spirit I mean their education In no country perhaps in the world is the law so general a study The profession itself is numerous and powerful and in most provinces it takes the lead The greater number of the deputies sent to the congress were lawyers But all who read and most do read endeavour to obtain some smattering in that science I have been told by an eminent bookseller that in no branch of his business after tracts of popular devotion were so many books as those on the law exported to the plantations The colonists have now fallen into the way of printing them for their own use I hear that they have sold nearly as many of Blackstone's Commentaries in America as in England General Gage marks out this disposition very particularly in a letter on your table He states that all the people in his government are lawyers or smatterers in law and that in Boston they have been enabled by successful chicane wholly to evade many parts of one of your capital penal constitutions The smartness of debate will say that this knowledge ought to teach them more clearly the rights of legislature their obligations to obedience and the penalties of rebellion All this is mighty well But my  The Attorney General  honourable and learned friend on the floor who condescends to mark what I say for animadversion will disdain that ground He has heard as well as I that when great honours and great emoluments do not win over this knowledge  to the service of the state it is a formidable adversary to government If the spirit be not tamed and broken by these happy methods it is stubborn and litigious  Abeunt studia in mores  This study renders men acute inquisitive dextrous prompt in attack ready in defence full of resources In other countries the people more simple and of a less mercurial cast judge of an ill principle in government only by an actual grievance here they anticipate the evil and judge of the pressure of the grievance by the badness of the principle They augur misgovernment at a distance and snuff the approach of tyranny in every tainted breeze  THE last cause of this disobedient spirit in the colonies is hardly less powerful than the rest as it is not merely moral but laid deep in the natural constitution of things Three thousand miles of ocean lie between you and them No contrivance can prevent the effect of this distance in weakening government Seas roll and months pass between the order and the execution and the want of a speedy explanation of a single point is enough to defeat an whole system You have indeed winged ministers of vengeance who carry your bolts in their pounces to the remotest verge of the sea But there a power steps in that limits the arrogance of raging passions and furious elements and says "So far shalt thou go and no farther" Who are you that should fret and rage and bite the chains of natureNothing worse happens to you than does to all nations who have extensive empire and it happens in all the forms into which empire can be thrown In large bodies the circulation of power must be less vigorous at the extremities Nature has said it The turk cannot govern Aegypt and Arabia and Curdistan as he governs  Thrace nor has he the same dominion in Crimea and Algiers which he has at Brusa and Smyrna Despotism itself is obliged to truck and huckster The sultan gets such obedience as he can He governs with a loose rein that he may govern at all and the whole of the force and vigour of his authority in his centre is derived from a prudent relaxation in all his borders Spain in her provinces is perhaps not so well obeyed as you are in yours She complies too she submits she watches times This is the immutable condition the eternal law of extensive and detached empire  THEN sir from these six capital sources of descent of form of government of religion in the northern provinces of manners in the southern of education of the remoteness of situation from the first mover of government from all these causes a fierce spirit of liberty has grown up It has grown with the growth of the people in your colonies and increased with the increase of their wealth a spirit that unhappily meeting with an exercise of power in England which however lawful is not reconcilable to any ideas of liberty much less with theirs has kindled this flame that is ready to consume us  I DO not mean to commend either the spirit in this excess or the moral causes which produce it Perhaps a more smooth and accommodating spirit of freedom in them would be more acceptable to us Perhaps ideas of liberty might be desired more reconcilable with an arbitrary and boundless authority Perhaps we might wish the colonists to be persuaded that their liberty is more secure when held in trust for them by us as their guardians during a perpetual minority than with any part of it in their own hands But the question is not whether their spirit deserves praise or blamewhat in  the name of God shall we do with it You have before you the object such as it is with all its glories with all its imperfections on its head You see the magnitude the importance the temper the habits the disorders By all these considerations we are strongly urged to determine something concerning it We are called upon to fix some rule and line for our future conduct which may give a little stability to our politics and prevent the return of such unhappy deliberations as the present Every such return will bring the matter before us in a still more untractable form For what astonishing and incredible things have we not seen already What monsters have not been generated from this unnatural contention Whilst every principle of authority and resistance has been pushed upon both sides as far as it would go there is nothing so solid and certain either in reasoning or in practice that has been not shaken Until very lately all authority in America seemed to be nothing but an emanation from yours Even the popular part of the colony constitution derived all its activity and its first vital movement from the pleasure of the crown We thought sir that the utmost which the discontented colonists could do was to disturb authority we never dreamt they could of themselves supply it knowing in general what an operose business it is to establish a government absolutely new But having for our purposes in this contention resolved that none but an obedient assembly should sit the humours of the people there finding all passage through the legal channel stopped with great violence broke out another way Some provinces have tried their experiment as we have tried ours and theirs has succeeded They have formed a government sufficient for its purposes without the bustle of a revolution or the troublesome formality of an election Evident necessity and tacit consent  have done the business in an instant So well they have done it that lord Dunmore the account is among the fragments on your table tells you that the new institution is infinitely better obeyed than the antient government ever was in its most fortunate period Obedience is what makes government and not the names by which it is called not the name of governor as formerly or committee as at present This new government has originated directly from the people and was not transmitted through any of the ordinary artificial media of a positive constitution It was not a manufacture ready formed and transmitted to them in that condition from England The evil arising from hence is this that the colonists having once found the possibility of enjoying the advantages of order in the midst of a struggle for liberty such struggles will not henceforward seem so terrible to the settled and sober part of mankind as they had appeared before the trial  PURSUING the same plan of punishing by the denial of the exercise of government to still greater lengths we wholly abrogated the antient government of Massachuset We were confident that the first feeling if not the very prospect of anarchy would instantly enforce a compleat submission The experiment was tried A new strange unexpected face of things appeared Anarchy is found tolerable A vast province has now subsisted and subsisted in a considerable degree of health and vigour for near a twelvemonth without governor without public council without judges without executive magistrates How long it will continue in this state or what may arise out of this unheardof situation how can the wisest of us conjecture Our late experience has taught us that many of those fundamental principles formerly believed infallible  are either not of the importance they were imagined to be or that we have not at all adverted to some other far more important and far more powerful principles which entirely overrule those we had considered as omnipotent I am much against any further experiments which tend to put to the proof any more of these allowed opinions which contribute so much to the public tranquillity In effect we suffer as much at home by this loosening of all ties and this concussion of all established opinions as we do abroad For in order to prove that the Americans have no right to their liberties we are every day endeavouring to subvert the maxims which preserve the whole spirit of our own To prove that the Americans ought not to be free we are obliged to depreciate the value of freedom itself and we never seem to gain a paltry advantage over them in debate without attacking some of those principles or deriding some of those feelings for which our ancestors have shed their blood  BUT sir in wishing to put an end to pernicious experiments I do not mean to preclude the fullest enquiry Far from it Far from deciding on a sudden or partial view I would patiently go round and round the subject and survey it minutely in every possible aspect Sir if I were capable of engaging you to an equal attention I would state that as far as I am capable of discerning there are but three ways of proceeding relative to this stubborn spirit which prevails in your colonies and disturbs your government These areTo change that spirit as inconvenient by removing the causes To prosecute it as criminal Or to comply with it as necessary I would not be guilty of an imperfect enumeration I can think of but these three Another has indeed been started that of giving up  the colonies but it met so slight a reception that I do not think myself obliged to dwell a great while upon it It is nothing but a little sally of anger like the frowardness of peevish children who when they cannot get all they would have are resolved to take nothing  THE first of these plans to change the spirit as inconvenient by removing the causes I think is the most like a systematic proceeding It is radical in its principle but it is attended with great difficulties some of them little short as I conceive of impossibilities This will appear by examining into the plans which have been proposed  AS the growing population in the colonies is evidently one cause of their resistance it was last session mentioned in both houses by men of weight and received not without applause that in order to check this evil it would be proper for the crown to make no further grants of land But to this scheme there are two objections The first that there is already so much unsettled land in private hands as to afford room for an immense future population although the crown not only withheld its grants but annihilated its soil If this be the case then the only effect of this avarice of desolation this hoarding of a royal wilderness would be to raise the value of the possessions in the hands of the great private monopolists without any adequate check to the growing and alarming mischief of population  BUT if you stopped your grants what would be the consequence The people would occupy without grants They have already so occupied in many places You cannot station garrisons in every part of these deserts If you drive the people from one place they will carry on their annual  tillage and remove with their flocks and herds to another Many of the people in the back settlements are already little attached to particular situations Already they have topped the Apalachian mountains From thence they behold before them an immense plain one vast rich level meadow a square of five hundred miles Over this they would wander without a possibility of restraint they would change their manners with the habits of their life would soon forget a government by which they were disowned would become Hordes of English Tartars and pouring down upon your unfortified frontiers a fierce and irresistible cavalry become masters of your governors and your counsellors your collectors and comptrollers and of all the slaves that adhered to them Such would and in no long time must be the effect of attempting to forbid as a crime and to suppress as an evil the command and blessing of Providence  "encrease and multiply"  Such would be the happy result of an endeavour to keep as a lair of wild beasts that earth which God by an express charter has given to the children of men Far different and surely much wiser has been our policy hitherto Hitherto we have invited our people by every kind of bounty to fixed establishments We have invited the husbandman to look to authority for his title We have taught him piously to believe in the mysterious virtue of wax and parchment We have thrown each tract of land as it was peopled into districts that the ruling power should never be wholly out of sight We have settled all we could and we have carefully attended every settlement with government  ADHERING sir as I do to this policy as well as for the reasons I have just given I think this new  project of hedgingin population to be neither prudent nor practicable  TO impoverish the colonies in general and in particular to arrest the noble course of their marine enterprizes would be a more easy task I freely confess it We have shewn a disposition to a system of this kind a disposition even to continue the restraint after the offence looking on ourselves as rivals to our colonies and persuaded that of course we must gain all that they shall lose Much mischief we may certainly do The power inadequate to all other things is often more than sufficient for this I do not look on the direct and immediate power of the colonies to resist our violence as very formidable In this however I may be mistaken But when I consider that we have colonies for no purpose but to be serviceable to us it seems to my poor understanding a little preposterous to make them unserviceable in order to keep them obedient It is in truth nothing more than the old and as I thought exploded problem of tyranny which proposes to beggar its subjects into submission But remember when you have compleated your system of impoverishment that nature still proceeds in her ordinary course that discontent will encrease with misery and that there are critical moments in the fortune of all states when they who are too weak to contribute to your prosperity may be strong enough to complete your ruin  Spoliatis arma supersunt  THE temper and character which prevail in our colonies are I am afraid unalterable by any human art We cannot I fear falsify the pedigree of this fierce people and persuade them that they are not sprung from a nation in whose veins the blood of freedom circulates The language in which they  would hear you tell them this tale would detect the imposition your speech would betray you An Englishman is the unfittest person on earth to argue another Englishman into slavery  I THINK it is nearly as little in our power to change their republican religion as their free descent or to substitute the Roman Catholic as a penalty or the church of England as an improvement The mode of inquisition and dragooning is going out of fashion in the old world and I should not confide much to their efficacy in the new The education of the Americans is also on the same unalterable bottom with their religion You cannot persuade them to burn their books of curious science to banish their lawyers from their courts of law or to quench the lights of their assemblies by refusing to choose those persons who are best read in their privileges It would be no less impracticable to think of wholly annihilating the popular assemblies in which these lawyers sit The army by which we must govern in their place would be far more chargeable to us not quite so effectual and perhaps in the end full as difficult to be kept in obedience  WITH regard to the high aristocratic spirit of Virginia and the southern colonies it has been proposed I know to reduce it by declaring a general enfranchisement of their slaves This project has had its advocates and panegyrists yet I never could argue myself into any opinion of it Slaves are often much attached to their masters A general wild offer of liberty would not always be accepted History furnishes few instances of it It is sometimes as hard to persuade slaves to be free as it is to compel freemen to be slaves and in this auspicious scheme we should have both these pleasing tasks on our hands at once But when we  talk of enfranchisement do we not perceive that the American master may enfranchise too and arm servile hands in defence of freedom A measure to which other people have had recourse more than once and not without success in a desperate situation of their affairs  SLAVES as these unfortunate black people are and dull as all men are from slavery must they not a little suspect the offer of freedom from that very nation which has sold them to their present masters From that nation one of whose causes of quarrel with those masters is their refusal to deal any more in that inhuman traffic An offer of freedom from England would come rather oddly shipped to them in an African vessel which is refused an entry into the ports of Virginia or Carolina with a cargo of three hundred Angola negroes It would be curious to see the Guinea captain attempting at the same instant to publish his proclamation of liberty and to advertise his sale of slaves  BUT let us suppose all these moral difficulties got over The ocean remains You cannot pump this dry and as long as it continues in its present bed so long all the causes which weaken authority by distance will continue  "Ye gods annihilate but space and time and make two lovers happy"  was a pious and passionate prayerbut just as reasonable as many of the serious wishes of very grave and solemn politicians  IF then sir it seems almost desperate to think of any alterative course for changing the moral causes and not quite easy to remove the natural which produce prejudices irreconcilable to the late exercise of our authority but that the spirit infallibly will continue and continuing will produce such  effects as now embarrass us the second mode under consideration is to prosecute that spirit in its overt acts as  criminal    AT this proposition I must pause a moment The thing seems a great deal too big for my ideas of jurisprudence It should seem to my way of conceiving such matters that there is a very wide difference in reason and policy between the mode of proceeding on the irregular conduct of scattered individuals or even of bands of men who disturb order within the state and the civil dissensions which may from time to time on great questions agitate the several communities which compose a great empire It looks to me to be narrow and pedantic to apply the ordinary ideas of criminal justice to this great public contest I do not know the method of drawing up an indictment against an whole people I cannot insult and ridicule the feelings of millions of my fellowcreatures as sir Edward Coke insulted one excellent individual Sir Walter Rawleigh at the bar I am not ripe to pass sentence on the gravest public bodies entrusted with magistracies of great authority and dignity and charged with the safety of their fellowcitizens upon the very same title that I am I really think that for wise men this is not judicious for sober men not decent for minds tinctured with humanity not mild and merciful  PERHAPS sir I am mistaken in my idea of an empire as distinguished from a single state or kingdom But my idea of it is this that an empire is the aggregate of many states under one common head whether this head be a monarch or a presiding republic It does in such constitutions frequently happen and nothing but the dismal cold dead uniformity of servitude can prevent its happening that the subordinate parts have  many local privileges and immunities Between these privileges and the supreme common authority the line may be extremely nice Of course disputes often too very bitter disputes and much ill blood will arise But though every privilege is an exemption in the case from the ordinary exercise of the supreme authority it is no denial of it The claim of a privilege seems rather  ex vi termini  to imply a superior power For to talk of the privileges of a state or of a person who has no superior is hardly any better than speaking nonsense Now in such unfortunate quarrels among the component parts of a great political union of communities I can scarcely conceive any thing more compleatly imprudent than for the head of the empire to insist that if any privilege is pleaded against his will or his acts that his whole authority is denied instantly to proclaim rebellion to beat to arms and to put the offending provinces under the ban Will not this sir very soon teach the provinces to make no distinctions on their part Will it not teach them that the government against which a claim of liberty is tantamont to hightreason is a government to which submission is equivalent to slavery It may not always be quite convenient to impress dependent communities with such an idea  WE are indeed in all disputes with the colonies by the necessity of things the judge It is true sir But I confess that the character of judge in my own cause is a thing that frightens me Instead of filling me with pride I am exceedingly humbled by it I cannot proceed with a stern assured judicial confidence until I find myself in something more like a judicial character I must have these hesitations as long as I am compelled to recollect that in my little reading upon  such contests as these the sense of mankind has at least as often decided against the superior as the subordinate power Sir let me add too that the opinion of my having some abstract right in my favour would not put me much at my ease in passing sentence unless I could be sure that there were no rights which in their exercise under certain circumstances were not the most odious of all wrongs and the most vexatious of all injustice Sir these considerations have great weight with me when I find things so circumstanced that I see the same party at once a civil litigant against me in a point of right and a culprit before me while I sit as a criminal judge on acts of his whose moral quality is to be decided upon the merits of that very litigation Men are every now and then put by the complexity of human affairs into strange situations but justice is the same let the judge be in what situation he will  THERE is sir also a circumstance which convinces me that this mode of criminal proceeding is not at least in the present stage of our contest altogether expedient which is nothing less than the conduct of those very persons who have seemed to adopt that mode by lately declaring a rebellion in Massachuset's Bay as they had formerly addressed to have traitors brought hither under an act of Henry the eighth for trial For though rebellion is declared it is not proceeded against as such nor have any steps been taken towards the apprehension or conviction of any individual offender either on our late or our former address but modes of public coercion have been adopted and such as have much more resemblance to a sort of qualified hostility towards an independant power than the punishment of rebellious subjects All this seems rather  inconsistent but it shews how difficult it is to apply these juridical ideas to our present case  IN this situation let us seriously and coolly ponder What is it we have got by all our menaces which have been many and ferocious What advantage have we derived from the penal laws we have passed and which for the time have been severe and numerous What advances have we made towards our object by the sending of a force which by land and sea is no contemptible strength Has the disorder abated Nothing lessWhen I see things in this situation after such confident hopes bold promises and active exertions I cannot for my life avoid a suspicion that the plan itself is not correctly right  IF then the removal of the causes of this spirit of American liberty be for the greater part or rather entirely impracticable if the ideas of criminal process be inapplicable or if applicable are in the highest degree inexpedient what way yet remains No way is open but the third and lastto comply with the American spirit as necessary or if you please to submit to it as a necessary evil  IF we adopt this mode if we mean to conciliate and concede let us see of what nature the concession ought to be To ascertain the nature of our concession we must look at their complaint The colonies complain that they have not the characteristic mark and seal of British freedom They complain that they are taxed in a parliament in which they are not represented If you mean to satisfy them at all you must satisfy them with regard to this complaint If you mean to please any people you must give them the boon which they ask not what you may think better  for them but of a kind totally different Such an act may be a wise regulation but it is no concession whereas our present theme is the mode of giving satisfaction  SIR I think you must perceive that I am resolved this day to have nothing at all to do with the question of the right of taxation Some gentlemen startlebut it is true I put it totally out of the question It is less than nothing in my consideration I do not indeed wonder nor will you sir that gentlemen of profound learning are fond of displaying it on this profound subject But my consideration is narrow confined and wholly limited to the policy of the question I do not examine whether the giving away a man's money be a power excepted and reserved out of the general trust of government and how far all mankind in all forms of polity are intitled to an exercise of that right by the charter of nature Or whether on the contrary a right of taxation is necessarily involved in the general principle of legislation and inseparable from the ordinary supreme power These are deep questions where great names militate against each other where reason is perplexed and an appeal to authorities only thickens the confusion For high and reverend authorities lift up their heads on both sides and there is no sure footing in the middle This point is the  great Serbonian bog betwixt Damiata and mount Casius old where armies whole have sunk  I do not intend to be overwhelmed in that bog though in such respectable company The question with me is not whether you have a right to render your people miserable but whether it is not your interest to make them happy It is not what a lawyer tells me I  may  do but what humanity reason and justice tell me I ought to do Is a politic act  the worse for being a generous one Is no concession proper but that which is made from your want of right to keep what you grant Or does it lessen the grace or dignity of relaxing in the exercise of an odious claim because you have your evidenceroom full of titles and your magazines stuffed with arms to enforce them What signify all those titles and all those arms Of what avail are they when the reason of the thing tells me that the assertion of my title is the loss of my suit and that I could do nothing but wound myself by the use of my own weapons  SUCH is stedfastly my opinion of the absolute necessity of keeping up the concord of this empire by a unity of spirit though in a diversity of operations that if I were sure the colonists had at their leaving this country sealed a regular compact of servitude that they had solemnly abjured all the rights of citizens that they had made a vow to renounce all ideas of liberty for them and their posterity to all generations yet I should hold myself obliged to conform to the temper I found universally prevalent in my own day and to govern two million of me  impatient of servitude on the principles of freedom I am not determining a point of law I am restoring tranquillity and the general character and situation of a people must determine what sort of government is fitted for them That point nothing else can or ought to determine  MY idea therefore without considering whether we yield as matter of right or grant as matter of favour is  to admit the people of our colonies into an interest in the constitution  and by recording that admission in the journals of parliament to give them as strong an assurance as the nature of the thing  will admit that we mean for ever to adhere to that solemn declaration of systematic indulgence  SOME years ago the repeal of a revenue act upon its understood principle might have served to shew that we intended an unconditional abatement of the exercise of a taxing power Such a measure was then sufficient to remove all suspicion and to give perfect content But unfortunate events since that time may make something further necessary and not more necessary for the satisfaction of the colonies than for the dignity and consistency of our own future proceedings  I HAVE taken a very incorrect measure of the disposition of the house if this proposal in itself would be received with dislike I think sir we have few American financiers But our misfortune is we are too acute we are too exquisite in our conjectures of the future for men oppressed with such great and present evils The more moderate among the opposers of parliamentary concession freely confess that they hope no good from taxation but they apprehend the colonists have further views and if this point were conceded they would instantly attack the tradelaws These gentlemen are convinced that this was the intention from the beginning and the quarrel of the Americans with taxation was no more than a cloke and cover to this design Such has been the language even of a  Mr Rice  gentleman of real moderation and of a natural temper well adjusted to fair and equal government I am however sir not a little surprized at this kind of discourse whenever I hear it and I am the more surprized on account of the arguments which I constantly find in company  with it and which are often urged from the same mouths and on the same day  FOR instance when we allege that it is against reason to tax a people under so many restraints in trade as the Americans the  Lord North  noble lord in the blue ribband shall tell you that the restraints on trade are futile and useless of no advantage to us and of no burthen to those on whom they are imposed that the trade to America is not secured by the acts of navigation but by the natural and irresistible advantage of a commercial preference  SUCH is the merit of the trade laws in this posture of the debate But when strong internal circumstances are urged against the taxes when the scheme is dissected when experience and the nature of things are brought to prove and do prove the utter impossibility of obtaining an effective revenue from the colonies when these things are pressed or rather press themselves so as to drive the advocates of colony taxes to a clear admission of the futility of the scheme then sir the sleeping trade laws revive from their trance and this useless taxation is to be kept sacred not for its own sake but as a counterguard and security of the laws of trade  THEN sir you keep up revenue laws which are mischievous in order to preserve trade laws that are useless Such is the wisdom of our plan in both its members They are separately given up as of no value and yet one is always to be defended for the sake of the other But I cannot agree with the noble lord nor with the pamphlet from whence he seems to have borrowed these ideas concerning the inutility of the trade laws For without idolizing them I am sure they are still in  many ways of great use to us and in former times they have been of the greatest They do confine and they do greatly narrow the market for the Americans But my perfect conviction of this does not help me in the least to discern how the revenue laws form any security whatsoever to the commercial regulations or that these commercial regulations are the true ground of the quarrel or that the giving way in any one instance of authority is to lose all that may remain unconceded  ONE fact is clear and indisputable The public and avowed origin of this quarrel was on taxation This quarrel has indeed brought on new disputes on new questions but certainly the least bitter and the fewest of all on the trade laws To judge which of the two be the real radical cause of quarrel we have to see whether the commercial dispute did in order of time precede the dispute on taxation There is not a shadow of evidence for it Next to enable us to judge whether at this moment a dislike to the trade laws be the real cause of quarrel it is absolutely necessary to put the taxes out of the question by a repeal See how the Americans act in this position and then you will be able to discern correctly what is the true object of the controversy or whether any controversy at all will remain Unless you consent to remove this cause of difference it is impossible with decency to assert that the dispute is not upon what it is avowed to be And I would sir recommend to your serious consideration whether it be prudent to form a rule for punishing people not on their own acts but on your conjectures Surely it is preposterous at the very best It is not justifying your anger by their misconduct but it is converting your illwill into their delinquency  BUT the colonies will go furtherAlas alas when will this speculating against fact and reason end What will quiet these panic fears which we entertain of the hostile effect of a conciliatory conduct Is it true that no case can exist in which it is proper for the sovereign to accede to the desires of his discontented subjects Is there any thing peculiar in this case to make a rule for itself Is all authority of course lost when it is not pushed to the extreme Is it a certain maxim that the fewer causes of dissatisfaction are left by government the more the subject will be inclined to resist and rebel  ALL these objections being in fact no more than suspicions conjectures divinations formed in defiance of fact and experience they did not sir discourage me from entertaining the idea of a conciliatory concession founded on the principles which I have just stated  IN forming a plan for this purpose I endeavoured to put myself in that frame of mind which was the most natural and the most reasonable and which was certainly the most probable means of securing me from all error I set out with a perfect distrust of my own abilities a total renunciation of every speculation of my own and with a profound reverence for the wisdom of our ancestors who have left us the inheritance of so happy a constitution and so flourishing an empire and what is a thousand times more valuable the treasury of the maxims and principles which formed the one and ebtained the other  DURING the reigns of the kings of Spain of the Austrian family whenever they were at a loss in the Spanish councils it was common for their statesmen to say that they ought to consult the genius  of Philip the second The genius of Philip the second might mislead them and the issue of their affairs shewed that they had not chosen the most perfect standard But sir I am sure that I shall not be misled when in a case of constitutional difficulty I consult the genius of the English constitution Consulting at that oracle it was with all due humility and piety I found four capital examples in a similar case before me those of Ireland Wales Chester and Durham  IRELAND before the English conquest though never governed by a despotic power had no parliament How far the English parliament itself was at that time modelled according to the present form is disputed among antiquarians But we have all the reason in the world to be assured that a form of parliament such as England then enjoyed she instantly communicated to Ireland and we are equally sure that almost every successive improvement in constitutional liberty as fast as it was made here was transmitted thither The feudal baronage and the feudal knighthood the roots of our primitive constitution were early transplanted into that soil and grew and flourished there Magna charta if it did not give us originally the house of commons gave us at least an house of commons of weight and consequence But your ancestors did not churlishly sit down alone to the feast of magna charta Ireland was made immediately a partaker This benefit of English laws and liberties I confess was not at first extended to  all  Ireland Mark the consequence English authority and English liberties had exactly the same boundaries Your standard could never be advanced an inch before your privileges Sir John Davis shews beyond a doubt that the refusal of a general communication of these rights was the true  cause why Ireland was five hundred years in subduing and after the vain projects of a military government attempted in the reign of queen Elizabeth it was soon discovered that nothing could make that country English in civility and allegiance but your laws and your forms of legislature It was not English arms but the English constitution that conquered Ireland From that time Ireland has ever had a general parliament as she had before a partial parliament You changed the people you altered the religion but you never touched the form or the vital substance of free government in that kingdom You deposed kings you restored them you altered the succession to theirs as well as to your own crown but you never altered their constitution the principle of which was respected by usurpation restored with the restoration of monarchy and established I trust for ever by the glorious revolution This has made Ireland the great and flourishing kingdom that it is and from a disgrace and a burthen intolerable to this nation has rendered her a principal part of our strength and ornament This country cannot be said to have ever formally taxed her The irregular things done in the confusion of mighty troubles and on the hinge of great revolutions even if all were done that is said to have been done form no example If they have any effect in argument they make an exception to prove the rule None of your own liberties could stand a moment if the casual deviations from them at such times were suffered to be used as proofs of their nullity By the lucrative amount of such casual breaches in the constitution judge what the stated and fixed rule of supply has been in that kingdom Your Irish pensioners would starve if they had no other fund to live on than taxes granted by English authority Turn your eyes to those popular grants from whence  all your great supplies are come and learn to respect that only source of public wealth in the British empire  MY next example is Wales This country was said to be reduced by Henry the third It was said more truly to be so by Edward the first But though then conquered it was not looked upon as any part of the realm of England Its old constitution whatever that might have been was destroyed and no good one was substituted in its place The care of that tract was put into the hands of lords marchersa form of government of a very singular kind a strange heterogeneous monster something between hostility and government perhaps it has a sort of resemblance according to the modes of those times to that of commander in chief at present to whom all civil power is granted as secondary The manners of the Welsh nation followed the genius of the government The people were ferocious restive savage and uncultivated sometimes composed never pacified Wales within itself was in perpetual disorder and it kept the frontier of England in perpetual alarm Benefits from it to the state there were none Wales was only known to England by incursion and invasion  SIR during that state of things parliament was not idle They attempted to subdue the fierce spirit of the Welsh by all sorts of rigorous laws They prohibited by statute the sending all sorts of arms into Wales as you prohibit by proclamation with something more of doubt on the legality the sending arms to America They disarmed the Welsh by statute as you attempted but still with more question on the legality to disarm New England by an instruction They made an act to drag offenders from Wales into England for trial as you  have done but with more hardship with regard to America By another act where one of the parties was an Englishman they ordained that his trial should be always by English They made acts to restrain trade as you do and they prevented the Welsh from the use of fairs and markets as you do the Americans from fisheries and foreign ports In short when the statutebook was not quite so much swelled as it is now you find no less than fifteen acts of penal regulation on the subject of Wales  HERE we rub our handsA fine body of precedents for the authority of parliament and the use of itI admit it fully and pray add likewise to these precedents that all the while Wales rid this kingdom like an  incubus  that it was an unprofitable and oppressive burthen and that an Englishman travelling in that country could not go six yards from the high road without being murdered  THE march of the human mind is slow Sir it was not until after two hundred years discovered that by an eternal law Providence had decreed vexation to violence and poverty to rapine Your ancestors did however at length open their eyes to the ill husbandry of injustice They found that the tyranny of a free people could of all tyrannies the least be endured and that laws made against an whole nation were not the most effectual methods for securing its obedience Accordingly in the twentyseventh year of Henry VIII the course was entirely altered With a preamble stating the entire and perfect rights of the crown of England it gave to the Welsh all the rights and privileges of English subjects A political order was established the military power gave way to the civil the marches were turned into counties But that a nation should have a right to English liberties  and yet no share at all in the fundamental security of these liberties the grant of their own property seemed a thing so incongruous that eight years after that is in the thirtyfifth of that reign a complete and not ill proportioned representation by counties and boroughs was bestowed upon Wales by act of parliament From that moment as by a charm the tumults subsided obedience was restored peace order and civilization followed in the train of libertyWhen the daystar of the English constitution had arisen in their hearts all was harmony within and without  Simul alba nautis  Stella refulsit  Defluit saxis agitatus humor  Concidunt venti fugiuntque nubes  Et minax quod sic voluere ponto  Unda recumbit  THE very same year the county palatine of Chester received the same relief from its oppressions and the same remedy to its disorders Before this time Chester was little less distempered than Wales The inhabitants without rights themselves were the fittest to destroy the rights of others and from thence Richard II drew the standing army of archers with which for a time he oppressed England The people of Chester applied to parliament in a petition penned as I shall read to you  TO the king our sovereign lord in most humble wise shewn unto your excellent majesty the inhabitants of your grace's county palatine of Chester that where the said county palatine of Chester is and hath been always hitherto exempt excluded and separated out and from your high court of parliament to have any knights and burgesses within the said court by reason whereof the  said inhabitants have hitherto sustained manifold disherisons losses and damages as well in their lands goods and bodies as in the good civil and politic governance and maintenance of the commonwealth of their said country And for as much as the said inhabitants have always hitherto been bound by the acts and statutes made and ordained by your said highness and your most noble progenitors by authority of the said court as far forth as other counties cities and boroughs have been that have had their knights and burgesses within your said court of parliament and yet have had neither knight ne burgess there for the said county palatine the said inhabitants for lack thereof have been oftentimes touched and grieved with acts and statutes made within the said court as well derogatory unto the most antient jurisdictions liberties and privileges of your said county palatine as prejudicial unto the common wealth quietness rest and peace of your grace's most bounden subjects inhabiting within the same  WHAT did parliament with this audacious addressreject it as a libel Treat it as an affront to government Spurn it as a derogation from the rights of legislature Did they toss it over the table Did they burn it by the hands of the common hangmanThey took the petition of grievance all rugged as it was without softening or temperament unpurged of the original bitterness and indignation of complaint they made it the very preamble to their act of redress and consecrated its principle to all ages in the sanctuary of legislation  HERE is my third example It was attended with the success of the two former Chester civilized as well as Wales has demonstrated that freedom and not servitude is the cure of anarchy as religion and not atheism is the true remedy for superstition Sir this pattern of Chester was followed in the reign of Charles II with regard to the  county palatine of Durham which is my fourth example This county had long lain out of the pale of free legislation So scrupulously was the example of Chester followed that the style of the preamble is nearly the same with that of the Chester act and without affecting the abstract extent of the authority of parliament it recognizes the equity of not suffering any considerable district in which the British subjects may act as a body to be taxed without their own voice in the grant  NOW if the doctrines of policy contained in these preambles and the force of these examples in the acts of parliament avail any thing what can be said against applying them with regard to America Are not the people of America as much Englishmen as the Welsh The preamble of the act of Henry VIII says the Welsh speak a language no way resembling that of his majesty's English subjects Are the Americans not as numerous If we may trust the learned and accurate judge Barrington's account of North Wales and take that as a standard to measure the rest there is no comparison The people cannot amount to above not a tenth part of the number in the colonies Is America in rebellion Wales was hardly ever free from it Have you attempted to govern America by penal statutes You made fifteen for Wales But your legislative authority is perfect with regard to America was it less perfect in Wales Chester and Durham But America is virtually represented What does the electric force of virtual representation more easily pass over the Atlantic than pervade Wales which lies in your neighbourhood or than Chester and Durham surrounded by abundance of representation that is actual and palpable But sir your ancestors thought this sort of virtual representation however ample to be totally insufficient  for the freedom of the inhabitants of territories that are so near and comparatively so inconsiderable How then can I think it sufficient for those which are infinitely greater and infinitely more remote  YOU will now sir perhaps imagine that I am on the point of proposing to you a scheme for a representation of the colonies in parliament Perhaps I might be inclined to entertain some such thought but a great flood stops me in my course  Opposuit natura  I cannot remove the eternal barriers of the creation The thing in that mode I do not know to be possible As I meddle with no theory I do not absolutely assert the impracticability of such a representation But I do not see my way to it and those who have been more confident have not been more successful However the arm of public benevolence is not shortened and there are often several means to the same end What nature has disjoined in one way wisdom may unite in another When we cannot give the benefit as we would wish let us not refuse it altogether If we cannot give the principal let us find a substitute But how Where What substitute  FORTUNATELY I am not obliged for the ways and means of this substitute to tax my own unproductive invention I am not even obliged to go to the rich treasury of the fertile framers of imaginary commonwealths not to the republic of Plato not to the Utopia of More not to the Oceana of Harrington It is before meIt is at my feet  and the rude swain treads daily on it with his clouted shoon  I only wish you to recognize for the theory the ancient constitutional policy of this kingdom with regard to representation as that policy has been declared in acts of parliament and as to the practice to return to that mode which an uniform experience  has marked out to you as best and in which you walked with security advantage and honour until the year  MY resolutions therefore mean to establish the equity and justice of a taxation of America by  grant  and not by  imposition  To mark the  legal competency  of the colony assemblies for the support of their government in peace and for public aids in time of war To acknowledge that this legal competency has had  a dutiful and beneficial exercise  and that experience has shewn the  benefit of their grants  and the  futility of parliamentary taxation as a method of supply    THESE solid truths compose six fundamental propositions There are three more resolutions corollary to these If you admit the first set you can hardly reject the others But if you admit the first I shall be far from solicitous whether you accept or refuse the last I think these six massive pillars will be of strength sufficient to support the temple of British concord I have no more doubt than I entertain of my existence that if you admitted these you would command an immediate peace and with but tolerable future management a lasting obedience in America I am not arrogant in this confident assurance The propositions are all mere matters of fact and if they are such facts as draw irresistible conclusions even in the stating this is the power of truth and not any management of mine  SIR I shall open the whole plan to you together with such observations on the motions as may tend to illustrate them where they may want explanation The first is a resolution  "  That the colonies and plantations of Great Britain in North America consisting of fourteen separate governments and containing two millions and upwards of free inhabitants  have not had the liberty and privilege of electing and sending any knights and burgesses or others to represent them in the high court of parliament  "  This is a plain matter of fact necessary to be laid down and excepting the description it is laid down in the language of the constitution it is taken nearly  verbatim  from acts of parliament  THE second is like unto the first  "  That the said colonies and plantations have been liable to and bounden by several subsidies payments rates and taxes given and granted by parliament though the said colonies and plantations have not their knights and burgesses in the said high court of parliament of their own election to represent the condition of their country by lack whereof they have been oftentimes touched and grieved by subsidies given granted and assented to in the said court in a manner prejudicial to the common wealth quietness rest and peace of the subjects inhabiting within the same  "  IS this description too hot or too cold too strong or too weak Does it arrogate too much to the supreme legislature Does it lean too much to the claims of the people If it runs into any of these errors the fault is not mine It is the language of your own ancient acts of parliament  Non meus hic sermo sed quae praecepit Ofellus rusticus abnormis sapiens  It is the genuine produce of the ancient rustic manly homebred sense of this countryI did not dare to rub off a particle of the venerable rust that rather adorns and preserves than destroys the metal It would be a profanation to touch with a tool the stones which construct the sacred altar of peace I would not violate with modern polish the ingenuous and noble roughness of these truly constitutional materials Above all things I was resolved not to be guilty of tampering the odious vice of restless and unstable minds I put my  foot in the tracks of our forefathers where I can neither wander nor stumble Determining to fix articles of peace I was resolved not to be wise beyond what was written I was resolved to use nothing else than the form of sound words to let others abound in their own sense and carefully to abstain from all expressions of my own What the law has said I say In all things else I am silent I have no organ but for her words This if it be not ingenious I am sure is safe  THERE are indeed words expressive of grievance in this second resolution which those who are resolved always to be in the right will deny to contain matter of fact as applied to the present case although parliament thought them true with regard to the counties of Chester and Durham They will deny that the Americans were ever  "touched and grieved"  with the taxes If they consider nothing in taxes but their weight as pecuniary impositions there might be some pretence for this denial But men may be sorely touched and deeply grieved in their privileges as well as in their purses Men may lose little in property by the act which takes away all their freedom When a man is robbed of a trifle on the highway it is not the twopence lost that constitutes the capital outrage This is not confined to privileges Even ancient indulgencies withdrawn without offence on the part of those who enjoyed such favours operate as grievances But were the Americans then not touched and grieved by the taxes in some measure merely as taxes If so why were they almost all either wholly repealed or exceedingly reduced Were they not touched and grieved even by the regulating duties of the sixth of George II Else why were the duties first reduced to one third in and afterwards to a third of that third in the year Were they  not touched and grieved by the stampact I shall say they were until that tax is revived Were they not touched and grieved by the duties of which were likewise repealed and which lord Hillsborough tells you for the ministry were laid contrary to the true principle of commerce Is not the assurance given by that noble person to the colonies of a resolution to lay no more taxes on them an admission that taxes would touch and grieve them Is not the resolution of the noble lord in the blue ribband now standing on your journals the strongest of all proofs that parliamentary subsidies really touched and grieved them Else why all these changes modifications repeals assurances and resolutions  THE next proposition is  "  That from the distance of the said colonies and from other circumstances no method hath hitherto been devised for procuring a representation in parliament for the said colonies  "  This is an assertion of a fact I go no further on the paper though in my private judgment an useful representation is impossible I am sure it is not desired by them nor ought it perhaps by us but I abstain from opinions  THE fourth resolution is  "  That each of the said colonies hath within itself a body chosen in part or in the whole by the freemen freeholders or other free inhabitants thereof commonly called the general assembly or general court with powers legally to raise levy and assess according to the several usage of such colonies duties and taxes towards defraying all sorts of public services  "  THIS competence in the colony assemblies is certain It is proved by the whole tenour of their acts of supply in all the assemblies in which the constant style of granting is  "an aid to his majesty"  and  acts granting to the crown have regularly for near a century passed the public offices without dispute Those who have been pleased paradoxically to deny this right holding that none but the British parliament can grant to the crown are wished to look to what is done not only in the colonies but in Ireland in one uniform unbroken tenour every session Sir I am surprized that this doctrine should come from some of the law servants of the crown I say that if the crown could be responsible his majestybut certainly the ministers and even these law officers themselves through whose hands the acts pass biennially in Ireland or annually in the colonies are in an habitual course of committing impeachable offences What habitual offenders have been all presidents of the council all secretaries of state all first lords of trade all attornies and all solicitors general However they are safe as no one impeaches them and there is no ground of charge against them except in their own unfounded theories  THE fifth resolution is also a resolution of fact  "  That the said general assemblies general courts or other bodies legally qualified as aforesaid have at sundry times freely granted several large subsidies and public aids for his majesty's service according to their abilities when required thereto by letter from one of his majesty's principal secretaries of state and that their right to grant the same and their chearfulness and sufficiency in the said grants have been at sundry times acknowledged by parliament  "  To say nothing of their great expences in the Indian wars and not to take their exertion in foreign ones so high as the supplies in the year not to go back to their public contributions in the year I shall begin to travel only where the journals give me light resolving to deal in nothing but fact authenticated by  parliamentary record and to build myself wholly on that solid basis  ON the th of April  Journals of the house Vol XXV  a committee of this house came to the following resolution  "Resolved  "  That it is the opinion of this committee  that it is just and reasonable  that the several provinces and colonies of Massachuset's Bay New Hampshire Connecticut and Rhode Island be reimbursed the expences they have been at in taking and securing to the crown of Great Britain the island of Cape Breton and its dependencies  "  THESE expences were immense for such colonies They were above l sterling money first raised and advanced on their public credit  ON the th of January  Journals of the house Vol XXVII  a message from the king came to us to this effect  "  His majesty being sensible of the zeal and vigour with which his faithful subjects of certain colonies in North America have exerted themselves in defence of his majesty's just rights and possessions recommends it to this house to take the same into their consideration and to enable his majesty to give them such assistance as may be a  proper reward and encouragement"  ON the d of February  Ibid  the house came to a suitable resolution expressed in words nearly the same as those of the message but with the further addition that the money then voted was as an  encouragement  to the colonies to exert themselves with vigour It will not be necessary to go through all the testimonies which your own records have given to the truth of my resolutions I will only refer you to the places in the journals  Vol XXVIIth and th May  Vol XXVIIIJune st April th and th March th and st and April th Jan th and th  Vol XXIXJan d and th March th and th  SIR here is the repeated acknowledgment of parliament that the colonies not only gave but gave to satiety This nation has formally acknowledged two things first that the colonies had gone beyond their abilities parliament having thought it necessary to reimburse them secondly that they had acted legally and laudably in their grants of money and their maintenance of troops since the compensation is expressly given as reward and encouragement Reward is not bestowed for acts that are unlawful and encouragement is not held out to things that deserve reprehension My resolution therefore does nothing more than collect into one proposition what is scattered through your journals I give you nothing but your own and you cannot refuse in the gross what you have so often acknowleged in detail The admission of this which will be so honourable to them and to you will indeed be mortal to all the miserable stories by which the passions of the misguided people have been engaged in an unhappy system The people heard indeed from the beginning of these disputes one thing continually dinned in their ears that reason and justice demanded that the Americans who paid no taxes should be compelled to contribute How did that fact of their paying nothing stand when the taxing system began When Mr Grenville began to form his system of American revenue he stated in this house that the colonies were then in debt two millions  six hundred thousand pounds sterling money and was of opinion they would discharge that debt in four years On this state those untaxed people were actually subject to the payment of taxes to the amount of six hundred and fifty thousand a year In fact however Mr Grenville was mistaken The funds given for sinking the debt did not prove quite so ample as both the colonies and he expected The calculation was too sanguine the reduction was not compleated till some years after and at different times in different colonies However the taxes after the war continued too great to bear any addition with prudence or propriety and when the burthens imposed in consequence of former requisitions were discharged our tone became too high to resort again to requisition No colony since that time ever has had any requisition whatsoever made to it  WE see the sense of the crown and the sense of parliament on the productive nature of a  revenue by grant  Now search the same journals for the produce of the  revenue by imposition  Where is itlet us know the volume and the pagewhat is the gross what is the nett produceto what service is it appliedhow have you appropriated its surplusWhat can none of the many skilful indexmakers that we are now employing find any trace of itWell let them and that rest togetherBut are the journals which say nothing of the revenue as silent on the discontentOh no a child may find it It is the melancholy burthen and blot of every page  I THINK then I am from those journals justified in the sixth and last resolution which is  "  That it hath been found by experience that the manner of granting the said supplies and aids by the said general assemblies hath been more agreeable to the said colonies and more beneficial and conducive to the public  service than the mode of giving and granting aids in parliament to be raised and paid in the said colonies  "  This makes the whole of the fundamental part of the plan The conclusion is irresistible You cannot say that you were driven by any necessity to an exercise of the utmost rights of legislature You cannot assert that you took on yourselves the task of imposing colony taxes from the want of another legal body that is competent to the purpose of supplying the exigencies of the state without wounding the prejudices of the people Neither is it true that the body so qualified and having that competence had neglected the duty  THE question now on all this accumulated matter iswhether you will chuse to abide by a profitable experience or a mischievous theory whether you chuse to build on imagination or fact whether you prefer enjoyment or hope satisfaction in your subjects or discontent  IF these propositions are accepted every thing which has been made to enforce a contrary system must I take it for granted fall along with it On that ground I have drawn the following resolution which when it comes to be moved will naturally be divided in a proper manner  "  That it may be proper to repeal an act made in the seventh year of the reign of his present majesty intituled An act for granting certain duties in the British colonies and plantations in America for allowing a drawback of the duties of customs upon the exportation from this kingdom of coffee and cocoanuts of the produce of the said colonies or plantations for discontinuing the drawbacks payable on China earthenware exported to America and for more effectually preventing the clandestine running of goods in the said colonies and plantationsAnd that it may be proper to repeal an act made in the fourteenth year of the reign of his present majesty intituled An act to discontinue in such manner  and for such time as are therein mentioned the landing and discharging lading or shipping of goods wares and merchandize at the town and within the harbour of Boston in the province of Massachuset's Bay in North AmericaAnd that it may be proper to repeal an act made in the fourteenth year of the reign of his present majesty intituled An act for the impartial administration of justice in the cases of persons questioned for any acts done by them in the execution of the law or for the suppression of riots and tumults in the province of Massachuset's Bay in New EnglandAnd that it may be proper to repeal an act made in the fourteenth year of the reign of his present majesty intituled An act for the better regulating the government of the province of the Massachuset's Bay in New EnglandAnd also that it may be proper to explain and amend an act made in the thirtyfifth year of the reign of king Henry the eighth intituled An act for the trial of treasons committed out of the king's dominions  "  I WISH sir to repeal the Boston port bill because independently of the dangerous precedent of suspending the rights of the subject during the king's pleasure it was passed as I apprehend with less regularity and on more partial principles than it ought The corporation of Boston was not heard before it was condemned Other towns full as guilty as she was have not had their ports blocked up Even the restraining bill of the present session does not go to the length of the Boston port act The same ideas of prudence which induced you not to extend equal punishment to equal guilt even when you were punishing induce me who mean not to chastise but to reconcile to be satisfied with the punishment already partially inflicted  IDEAS of prudence and accomodation to circumstances prevent you from taking away the  charters of Connecticut and Rhodeisland as you have taken away that of Massachuset's colony though the crown has far less power in the two former provinces than it enjoyed in the latter and though the abuses have been full as great and as flagrant in the exempted as in the punished The same reasons of prudence and accommodation have weight with me in restoring the charter of Massachuset's Bay Besides sir the act which changes the charter of Massachuset's is in many particulars so exceptionable that if I did not wish absolutely to repeal I would by all means desire to alter it as several of its provisions tend to the subversion of all public and private justice Such among others is the power in the governor to change the sheriff at his pleasure and to make a new returning officer for every special cause It is shameful to behold such a regulation standing among English laws  THE act for bringing persons accused of committing murder under the orders of government to England for trial is but temporary That act has calculated the probable duration of our quarrel with the colonies and is accommodated to that supposed duration I would hasten the happy moment of reconciliation and therefore must on my principle get rid of that most justly obnoxious act  THE act of Henry the eighth for the trial of treasons I do not mean to take away but to confine it to its proper bounds and original intention to make it expressly for trial of treasons and the greatest treasons may be committed in places where the jurisdiction of the crown does not extend  HAVING guarded the privileges of local legislature I would next secure to the colonies a fair and unbiassed judicature for which purpose sir I propose the following resolution  "  That from the time  when the general assembly or general court of any colony or plantation in North America shall have appointed by act of assembly duly confirmed a settled salary to the offices of the chief justice and other judges of the superior court it may be proper that the said chief justice and other judges of the superior courts of such colony shall hold his and their office and offices during their good behaviour and shall not be removed therefrom but when the said removal shall be adjudged by his majesty in council upon a hearing on complaint from the general assembly or on a complaint from the governor or council or the house of representatives severally of the colony in which the said chief justice and other judges have exercised the said offices  "  THE next resolution relates to the courts of admiralty  IT is this  "  That it may be proper to regulate the courts of admiralty or vice admiralty authorized by the th chap of the th of George the third in such a manner as to make the same more commodious to those who sue or are sued in the said courts and to provide for the more decent maintenance of the judges in the same  "  THESE courts I do not wish to take away they are in themselves proper establishments This court is one of the capital securities of the act of navigation The extent of its jurisdiction indeed has been encreased but this is altogether as proper and is indeed on many accounts more eligible where new powers were wanted than a court absolutely new But courts incommodiously situated in effect deny justice  The solicitorgeneral informed Mr B when the resolutions were separately moved that the grievance of the judges partaking of the profits of the seizure had been redressed by office accordingly the resolution was amended  and a court partaking in  the fruits of its own condemnation is a robber The congress complain and complain justly of this grievance  THESE are the three consequential propositions I have thought of two or three more but they come rather too near detail and to the province of executive government which I wish parliament always to superintend never to assume If the first six are granted congruity will carry the latter three If not the things that remain unrepealed will be I hope rather unseemly incumbrances on the building than very materially detrimental to its strength and stability  HERE sir I should close but that I plainly perceive some objections remain which I ought if possible to remove The first will be that in resorting to the doctrine of our ancestors as contained in the preamble to the Chester act I prove too much that the grievance from a want of representation stated in that preamble goes to the whole of legislation as well as to taxation And that the colonies grounding themselves upon that doctrine will apply it to all parts of legislative authority  TO this objection with all possible deference and humility and wishing as little as any man living to impair the smallest particle of our supreme authority I answer that  the words are the words of parliament and not mine  and that all false and inconclusive inferences drawn from them are not mine for I heartily disclaim any such inference I have chosen the words of an act of parliament which Mr Grenville surely a tolerably zealous and very judicious advocate for the sovereignty of parliament formerly moved to have read at your table in confirmation of his tenets It is true that lord Chatham considered these preambles as declaring strongly in favour  of his opinions He was a no less powerful advocate for the privileges of the Americans Ought I not from hence to presume that these preambles are as favourable as possible to both when properly understood favourable both to the rights of parliament and to the privilege of the dependencies of this crown But sir the object of grievance in my resolution I have not taken from the Chester but from the Durham act which confines the hardship of want of representation to the case of subsidies and which therefore falls in exactly with the case of the colonies But whether the unrepresented counties were  de jure  or  de facto  bound the preambles do not accurately distinguish nor indeed was it necessary for whether  de jure  or  de facto  the legislature thought the exercise of the power of taxing as of right or as of fact without right equally a grievance and equally oppressive  I DO not know that the colonies have in any geral way or in any cool hour gone much beyond the demand of immunity in relation to taxes It is not fair to judge of the temper or dispositions of any man or any set of men when they are composed and at rest from their conduct or their expressions in a state of disturbance and irritation It is besides a very great mistake to imagine that mankind follow up practically any speculative principle either of government or of freedom as far as it will go in argument and logical illation We Englishmen stop very short of the principles upon which we support any given part of our constitution or even the whole of it together I could easily if I had not already tired you give you very striking and convincing instances of it This is nothing but what is natural and proper All government indeed every human benefit and enjoyment every virtue and every prudent act is founded on compromise  and barter We balance inconveniencies we give and take we remit some rights that we may enjoy others and we chuse rather to be happy citizens than subtle disputants As we must give away some natural liberty to enjoy civil advantages so we must sacrifice some civil liberties for the advantages to be derived from the communion and fellowship of a great empire But in all fair dealings the thing bought must bear some proportion to the purchase paid None will barter away the immediate jewel of his soul Though a great house is apt to make slaves haughty yet it is purchasing a part of the artificial importance of a great empire too dear to pay for it all essential rights and all the intrinsic dignity of human nature None of us who would not risque his life rather than fall under a government purely arbitrary But although there are some amongst us who think our constitution wants many improvements to make it a complete system of liberty perhaps none who are of that opinion would think it right to aim at such improvement by disturbing his country and risquing every thing that is dear to him In every arduous enterprize we consider what we are to lose as well as what we are to gain and the more and better stake of liberty every people possess the less they will hazard in a vain attempt to make it more These are  the cords of man  Man acts from adequate motives relative to his interest and not on metaphysical speculations Aristotle the great master of reasoning cautions us and with great weight and propriety against this species of delusive geometrical accuracy in moral arguments as the most fallacious of all sophistry  THE Americans will have no interest contrary to the grandeur and glory of England when they are not oppressed by the weight of it and they will rather  be inclined to respect the acts of a superintending legislature when they see them the acts of that power which is itself the security not the rival of their secondary importance In this assurance my mind most perfectly acquiesces and I confess I feel not the least alarm from the discontents which are to arise from putting people at their ease nor do I apprehend the destruction of this empire from giving by an act of free grace and indulgence to two millions of my fellow citizens some share of those rights upon which I have always been taught to value myself  IT is said indeed that this power of granting vested in American assemblies would dissolve the unity of the empire which was preserved entire although Wales and Chester and Durham were added to it Truly Mr Speaker I do not know what this unity means nor has it ever been heard of that I know in the constitutional policy of this country The very idea of subordination of parts excludes this notion of simple and undivided unity England is the head but she is not the head and the members too Ireland has ever had from the beginning a separate but not an independent legislature which far from distracting promoted the union of the whole Every thing was sweetly and harmoniously disposed through both islands for the conservation of English dominion and the communication of English liberties I do not see that the same principles might not be carried into twenty islands and with the same good effect This is my model with regard to America as far as the internal circumstances of the two countries are the same I know no other unity of this empire than I can draw from its example during these periods when it seemed to my poor understanding more united than it is now or than it is likely to be by the present methods  BUT since I speak of these methods I recollect Mr Speaker almost too late that I promised before I finished to say something of the proposition of the  Lord North  noble lord on the floor which has been so lately received and stands on your journals I must be deeply concerned whenever it is my misfortune to continue a difference with the majority of this house But as the reasons for that difference are my apology for thus troubling you suffer me to state them in a very few words I shall compress them into as small a body as I possibly can having already debated that matter at large when the question was before the committee  FIRST then I cannot admit that proposition of a ransom by auctionbecause it is a meer project It is a thing new unheard of supported by no experience justified by no analogy without example of our ancestors or root in the constitution It is neither regular parliamentary taxation nor colony grant  Experimentum in corpore vili  is a good rule which will ever make me adverse to any trial of experiments on what is certainly the most valuable of all subjects the peace of this empire  SECONDLY it is an experiment which must be fatal in the end to our constitution For what is it but a scheme for taxing the colonies in the antichamber of the noble lord and his successors To settle the quotas and proportions in this house is clearly impossible You sir may flatter yourself you shall sit a state auctioneer with your hammer in your hand and knock down to each colony as it bids But to settle on the plan laid down by the noble lord the true proportional payment for four or five and twenty governments according to the absolute and the relative wealth of each and according to the British proportion of wealth and burthen  is a wild and chimerical notion This new taxation must therefore come in by the backdoor of the constitution Each quota must be brought to this house ready formed you can neither add nor alter You must register it You can do nothing further For on what grounds can you deliberate either before or after the proposition You cannot hear the counsel for all these provinces quarrelling each on its own quantity of payment and its proportion to others If you should attempt it the committee of provincial ways and means or by whatever other name it will delight to be called must swallow up all the time of parliament  THIRDLY it does not give satisfaction to the complaint of the colonies They complain that they are taxed without their consent you answer that you will fix the sum at which they shall be taxed That is you give them the very grievance for the remedy You tell them indeed that you will leave the mode to themselves I really beg pardon it gives me pain to mention it but you must be sensible that you will not perform this part of the compact For suppose the colonies were to lay the duties which furnished their contingent upon the importation of your manufactures you know you would never suffer such a tax to be laid You know too that you would not suffer many other modes of taxation So that when you come to explain yourself it will be found that you will neither leave to themselves the quantum nor the mode nor indeed any thing The whole is delusion from one end to the other  FOURTHLY this method of ransom by auction unless it be  universally  accepted will plunge you into great and inextricable difficulties In what year of our Lord are the proportions of payments to be settled To say nothing of the impossibility that colony  agents should have general powers of taxing the colonies at their discretion consider I implore you that the communication by special messages and orders between these agents and their constituents on each variation of the case when the parties come to contend together and to dispute on their relative proportions will be a matter of delay perplexity and confusion that never can have an end  IF all the colonies do not appear at the outcry what is the condition of those assemblies who offer by themselves or their agents to tax themselves up to your ideas of their proportion The refractory colonies who refuse all composition will remain taxed only to your old impositions which however grievous in principle are trifling as to production The obedient colonies in this scheme are heavily taxed the refractory remain unburthened What will you do Will you lay new and heavier taxes by parliament on the disobedient Pray consider in what way you can do it You are perfectly convinced that in the way of taxing you can do nothing but at the ports Now suppose it is Virginia that refuses to appear at your auction while Maryland and North Carolina bid handsomely for their ransom and are taxed to your quota How will you put these colonies on a par Will you tax the tobacco of Virginia If you do you give its deathwound to your English revenue at home and to one of the very greatest articles of your own foreign trade If you tax the import of that rebellious colony what do you tax but your own manufactures or the goods of some other obedient and already welltaxed colony Who has said one word on this labyrinth of detail which bewilders you more and more as you enter into it Who has presented who can present you with a clue to lead you out of it I think sir it is impossible that you should not recollect  that the colony bounds are so implicated in one another you know it by your other experiments in the bill for prohibiting the NewEngland fishery that you can lay no possible restraints on almost any of them which may no be presently eluded if you do not confound the innocent with the guilty and burthen those whom upon every principle you ought to exonerate He must be grossly ignorant of America who thinks that without falling into this confusion of all rules of equity and policy you can restrain any single colony especially Virginia and Maryland the central and most important of them all  LET it also be considered that either in the present confusion you settle a permanent contingent which will and must be trifling and then you have no effectual revenue or you change the quota at every exigency and then on every new repartition you will have a new quarrel  REFLECT besides that when you have fixed a quota for every colony you have not provided for prompt and punctual payment Suppose one two five ten years arrears You cannot issue a treasury extent against the failing colony You must make new Boston port bills new restraining laws new acts for dragging men to England for trial You must send out new fleets new armies All is to begin again From this day forward the empire is never to know an hour's tranquillity An intestine fire will be kept alive in the bowels of the colonies which one time or other must consume this whole empire I allow indeed that the empire of Germany raises her revenue and her troops by quotas and contingents but the revenue of the empire and the army of the empire is the worst revenue and the worst army in the world  INSTEAD of a standing revenue you will therefore have a perpetual quarrel Indeed the noble lord who proposed this project of a ransom by auction seemed himself to be of that opinion His project was rather designed for breaking the union of the colonies than for establishing a revenue He confessed he apprehended that his proposal would not be to  their taste  I say this scheme of disunion seems to be at the bottom of the project for I will not suspect that the noble lord meant nothing but merely to delude the nation by an airy phantom which he never intended to realize But whatever his views may be as I propose the peace and union of the colonies as the very foundation of my plan it cannot accord with one whose foundation is perpetual discord  COMPARE the two This I offer to give you is plain and simple The other full of perplexed and intricate mazes This is mild that harsh This is found by experience effectual for its purposes the other is a new project This is universal the other calculated for certain colonies only This is immediate in its conciliatory operation the other remote contingent full of hazard Mine is what becomes the dignity of a ruling people gratuitous unconditional and not held out as matter of bargain and sale I have done my duty in proposing it to you I have indeed tired you by a long discourse but this is the misfortune of those to whose influence nothing will be conceded and who must win every inch of their ground by argument You have heard me with goodness May you decide with wisdom For my part I feel my mind greatly disburthened by what I have done today I have been the less fearful of trying your patience because on this subject I mean to spare it altogether in future I have this comfort that in every stage  of the American affairs I have steadily opposed the measures that have produced the confusion and may bring on the destruction of this empire I now go so far as to risque a proposal of my own If I cannot give peace to my country I give it to my conscience  BUT what says the financier is peace to us without money Your plan gives us no revenue No But it doesFor it secures to the subject the power of REFUSAL the first of all revenues Experience is a cheat and fact a liar if this power in the subject of proportioning his grant or of not granting at all has not been found the richest mine of revenue ever discovered by the skill or by the fortune of man It does not indeed vote you £ ¾ths nor any other paltry limited sumBut it gives the strong box itself the fund the bank from whence only revenues can arise amongst a people sensible of freedom  Posita luditur arca  Cannot you in England cannot you at this time of day cannot you an house of commons trust to the principle which has raised so mighty a revenue and accumulated a debt of near millions in this country Is this principle to be true in England and false every where else Is it not true in Ireland Has it not hitherto been true in the colonies Why should you presume that in any country a body duly constituted for any function will neglect to perform its duty and abdicate its trust Such a presumption would go against all government in all modes But in truth this dread of penury of supply from a free assembly has no foundation in nature For first observe that besides the desire which all men have naturally of supporting the honour of their own government that sense of dignity and that security to property which ever attends freedom has a tendency to increase  the stock of the free community Most may be taken where most is accumulated And what is the soil or climate where experience has not uniformly proved that the voluntary flow of heapedup plenty bursting from the weight of its own rich luxuriance has ever run with a more copious stream of revenue than could be squeezed from the dry husks of oppressed indigence by the straining of all the politic machinery in the world  NEXT we know that parties must ever exist in a free country We know too that the emulations of such parties their contradictions their reciprocal necessities their hopes and their fears must send them all in their turns to him that holds the balance of the state The parties are the gamesters but government keeps the table and is sure to be the winner in the end When this game is played I really think it is more to be feared that the people will be exhausted than that government will not be supplied Whereas whatever is got by acts of absolute power ill obeyed because odious or by contracts ill kept because constrained will be narrow feeble uncertain and precarious  "  Ease would retract vows made in pain as violent and void  "  I for one protest against compounding our demands I declare against compounding for a poor limited sum the immense evergrowing eternal debt which is due to generous government from protected freedom And so may I speed in the great object I propose to you as I think it would not only be an act of injustice but would be the worst oeconomy in the world to compel the colonies to a sum certain either in the way of ransom or in the way of compulsory compact  BUT to clear up my ideas on this subjecta revenue from America transmitted hitherdo not  delude yourselvesyou never can receive itNo not a shilling We have experience that from remote countries it is not to be expected If when you attempted to extract revenue from Bengal you were obliged to return in loan what you had taken in imposition what can you expect from North America for certainly if ever there was a country qualified to produce wealth it is India or an institution fit for the transmission it is the EastIndia company America has none of these aptitudes If America gives you taxable objects on which you lay your duties here and gives you at the same time a surplus by a foreign sale of her commodities to pay the duties on these objects which you tax at home she has performed her part to the British revenue But with regard to her own internal establishments she may I doubt not she will contribute in moderation I say in moderation for she ought not to be permitted to exhaust herself She ought to be reserved to a war the weight of which with the enemies that we are most likely to have must be considerable in her quarter of the globe There she may serve you and serve you essentially  FOR that service for all service whether of revenue trade or empire my trust is in her interest in the British constitution My hold of the colonies is in the close affection which grows from common names from kindred blood from similar privileges and equal protection These are ties which though light as air are as strong as links of iron Let the colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights associated with your governmentthey will cling and grapple to you and no force under heaven will be of power to tear them from their allegiance But let it be once understood that your government may be one thing and their privileges another that these two things may exist without any  mutual relation the cement is gone the cohesion is loosened and every thing hastens to decay and dissolution As long as you have the wisdom to keep the sovereign authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty the sacred temple consecrated to our common faith wherever the chosen race and sons of England worship freedom they will turn their faces towards you The more they multiply the more friends you will have the more ardently they love liberty the more perfect will be their obedience Slavery they can have any where It is a weed that grows in every soil They may have it from Spain they may have it from Prussia But until you become lost to all feeling of your true interest and your natural dignity freedom they can have from none but you This is the commodity of price of which you have the monopoly This is the true act of navigation which binds to you the commerce of the colonies and through them secures to you the wealth of the world Deny them this participation of freedom and you break that sole bond which originally made and must still preserve the unity of the empire Do not entertain so weak an imagination as that your registers and your bonds your affidavits and your sufferances your cockets and your clearances are what form the great securities of your commerce Do not dream that your letters of office and your instructions and your suspending clauses are the things that hold together the great contexture of this mysterious whole These things do not make your government Dead instruments passive tools as they are it is the spirit of English communion that gives all their life and efficacy to them It is the spirit of the English constitution which infused through the mighty mass pervades feeds unites invigorates vivifies every part of the empire even down to the minutest member  IS it not the same virtue which does every thing for us here in England Do you imagine then that it is the landtax act which raises your revenue that it is the annual vote in the committee of supply which gives you your army or that it is the mutiny bill which inspires it with bravery and discipline No surely no It is the love of the people it is their attachment to their government from the sense of the deep stake they have in such a glorious institution which gives you your army and your navy and infuses into both that liberal obedience without which your army would be a base rabble and your navy nothing but rotten timber  ALL this I know well enough will sound wild and chimerical to the prophane herd of those vulgar and mechanical politicians who have no place among us a sort of people who think that nothing exists but what is gross and material and who therefore far from being qualified to be directors of the great movement of empire are not fit to turn a wheel in the machine But to men truly initiated and rightly taught these ruling and master principles which in the opinion of such men as I have mentioned have no substantial existence are in truth every thing and all in all Magnanimity in politics is not seldom the truest wisdom and a great empire and little minds go ill together If we are conscious of our situation and glow with zeal to fill our place as becomes our station and ourselves we ought to auspicate all our public proceedings on America with the old warning of the church  Sursum corda  We ought to elevate our minds to the greatness of that trust to which the order of Providence has called us By adverting to the dignity of this high calling our ancestors have turned a savage wilderness into a glorious empire  and have made the most extensive and the only honourable conquests not by destroying but by promoting the wealth the number the happiness of the human race Let us get an American revenue as we have got an American empire English privileges have made it all that it is English privileges alone will make it all it can be  IN full confidence of this unalterable truth I now  quod felix faustumque sit  lay the first stone of the temple of peace and I move you  "  THAT the colonies and plantations of Great Britain in North America consisting of fourteen separate governments and containing two millions and upwards of free inhabitants have not had the liberty and privilege of electing and sending any knights and burgesses or others to represent them in the high court of parliament  "  UPON this resolution the previous question was put and carriedfor the previous question against it  As the propositions were opened separately in the body of the speech the reader perhaps may wish to see the whole of them together in the form in which they were moved for  MOVED  "THAT the colonies and plantations of Great Britain in North America consisting of fourteen separate governments and containing two millions and upwards of free inhabitants have not had the liberty and privilege of electing and sending any knights and burgesses or others to represent them in the high court of parliament"  "THAT the said colonies and plantations have been made liable to and bounden by several subsidies payments rates and

thereof commonly called the general assembly or general court with powers legally to raise levy and assess according to the several usage of such colonies duties and taxes towards defraying all sorts of public services"  The first four motions and the last had the previous question put on them The others were negatived  The words in Italics were by an amendment that was carried left out of the motion which will appear in the journals though it is not the practice to insert such amendments in the votes  "THAT the said general assemblies general courts or other bodies legally qualified as aforesaid have at sundry times freely granted several large subsidies and public aids for his majesty's service according to their abilities when required thereto by letter from one of his majesty's principal secretaries of state and that their right to grant the same and their chearfulness and sufficiency  in the said grants have been at sundry times acknowledged by parliament"  "THAT it hath been found by experience that the manner of granting the said supplies and aids by the said general assemblies hath been more agreeable to the inhabitants of the said colonies and more beneficial and conducive to the public service than the mode of giving and granting aids and subsidies in parliament to be raised and paid in the said colonies"  "THAT it may be proper to repeal an act made in the
