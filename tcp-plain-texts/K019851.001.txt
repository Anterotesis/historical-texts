Conversion is at a general Stop has put his Hand to the Plow  I expect a Storm of Ill Language from the Fury of the Town and especially from those whose  English  Talent it is to Rail And without being taken for a Conjurer I may ven  ure to foretel That I shall be Cavil'd at about my  Mean Stile Rough Verse  and  Incorrect Language  Things I might indeed have taken more Care in But the Book is Printed and tho' I see some Faults 'tis too late to mend them And this is all I think needful to say to them  Possibly Somebody may take me for a  Dutchman  in which  hey are mistaken But I am one that would be glad to see  Englishmen  behave themselves better to Strangers and to Governors also that one might not be reproach'd in Foreign Countries for belonging to a  Nation that wants Manners    I assure you  Gentlemen  Strangers use us better abroad  nd we can give no reason but our Ill Nature for the contra  y here  Methinks an  Englishman  who is so proud of being call'd  Goodfellow  shou'd be civil And it cannot be denied but  e are in many Cases and particularly to Strangers the hurlishest People alive  As to Vices who can dispute our  Intemperance  while an  Honest Drunken Fellow  is a Character in a Man's Praise  ll our Reformations are Banters and will be so till our Magistrates and Gentry Reform themselves by way of Example  then and not till then they may be expected to punish others without  blushing    As to our  Ingratitude  I desire to be understood of that particular People who pretending to be Protestants have all along endeavour'd to reduce the Liberties and Religion of this Nation into the Hands of King  James  and his Popish Powers Together with such who enjoy the Peace and Protection of the present Government and yet abuse and affront the King who procur'd it and openly profess their Uneasiness under him These by whatsoever Names or Titles they are dignified or distinguish'd are the People aim'd at Nor do I disown but that it is so much the Temper of an  Englishman  to abuse his Benefactor that I could be glad to see it rectified  They who think I have been guilty of any Error in exposing the Crimes of my own Countrymen to themselves may among many honest Instances of the like nature find the same thing in Mr  Cowly  in his Imitation of the second Olympick Ode of  Pindar  His Words are these  But in this Thankless World the Givers  Are envi'd even by th' Receivers  'Tis now the Cheap and Frugal Fashion  Rather to hide than pay an Obligation  Nay 'tis much worse than so  It now an  Artifice  doth grow  Wrongs  and  Outrages  to do  Lest Men should think we  Owe    THE INTRODUCTION  SPeak  Satyr  for there's none can tell like thee  Whether 'tis Folly Pride or Knavery  That makes this discontented Land appear  Less happy now in Times of Peace than War  Why Civil Feuds disturb the Nation more  Than all our Bloody Wars have done before  Fools out of Favour grudge at Knaves in Place  And Men are always honest in Disgrace  The CourtPreferments make Men Knaves in course  But they which wou'd be in them wou'd be worse  Tis not at Foreigners that we repine  Wou'd Foreigners their Perquisites resign  The Grand Contention's plainly to be seen  To get some Men put out and some put in  or this our Srs make long Harangues  nd florid Mrs whet their polish'd Tongues  tatesmen are always sick of one Disease  nd a

Sovereign Balsam's once appli'd  he Zealot never fails to change his Side  nd when he must the Golden Key resign  e Railing Spirit comes about again  Who shall this Bubbl'd Nation disabuse  While they their own Felicities refuse  Who at the Wars have made such mighty Pother  And now are falling out with one another  With needless Fears the Jealous Nation fill  And always have been sav'd against their Will  Who Fifty Millions Sterling have disburs'd  To be with Peace and too much Plenty curs'd  Who their Old Monarch eagerly undo  And yet uneasily obey the New  Search  Satyr  search a deep Incision make  The Poyson's strong the Antidote's too weak  'Tis pointed Truth must manage this Dispute  And downright English  Englishmen  confute  Whet thy just Anger at the Nation's Pride  And with keen Phrase repel the vicious Tide  To  Englishmen  their own beginning show  And ask them why they slight their Neighbours so  Go back to Elder Times and Ages past  And Nations into long Oblivion cast  To Old  Britannia  's Youthful Days retire  And there for  TrueBorn Englishmen  enquire  Britannia  freely will disown the Name  And hardly knows her self from whence they came  Wonders that They of all Men should pretend  To Birth and Blood and for a Name contend  Go back to Causes where our Follies dwell  And fetch the dark Original from Hell  Speak  Satyr  for there's none like thee can tell  The TrueBorn EnglishMan PART I  WHereever God erects a House of Prayer  The Devil always builds a Chapel there  And 'twill be found upon Examination  The latter has the largest Congregation  For ever since he first debauch'd the Mind  He made a perfect Conquest of Mankind  With Uniformity of Service he  Reigns with a general Aristocracy  No Nonconforming Sects disturb his Reign  For of his Yoak there's very few complain  He knows the Genius and the Inclination  And matches proper Sins for ev'ry Nation  He needs no StandingArmy Government  He always rules us by our own Consent  His Laws are easy and his gentle Sway  Makes it exceeding pleasant to obey  The List of his Vicegerents and Commanders  Outdoes your  Caesars  or your  Alexanders    They never fail of his infernal Aid  And he's as certain ne'er to be betray'd  Through all the World they spread his vast Command  And Death's Eternal Empire's maintain'd  They rule so politickly and so well  As if they were L J of Hell  Duly divided to debauch Mankind  And plant Infernal Dictates in his Mind  Pride  the first Peer and President of Hell  To his share  Spain  the largest Province fell  The subtile Prince thought fittest to bestow  On these the Golden Mines of  Mexico    With all the Silver Mountains of Peru  Wealth which would in wise hands the World undo  Because he knew their Genius was such  Too Lazy and too Haughty to be Rich  So proud a People so above their Fate  That if reduc'd to beg they'll beg in State  Lavish of Money to be counted Brave  And proudly starve because they scorn to save  Never was Nation in the World before  So very Rich and yet so very Poor  Lust  chose the Torrid Zone of  Italy    Where Blood ferments in Rapes and Sodomy  Where swelling Veins o'erflow with livid Streams  With Heat impregnate from  Vesuvian  Flames  Whose flowing Sulphur forms Infernal Lakes  And human Body of the Soil partakes  There Nature ever burns with hot Desires  Fann'd with Luxuriant Air from Subterranean Fires▪  Here undisturb'd in Floods of scalding Lust  Th' Infernal King reigns with Infernal Gust  Drunk'ness  the Darling Favourite of Hell  Chose  Germany  to rule and rules so well  No Subjects more obsequiously obey  None please so well or are so pleas'd as they  The cunning Artist manages so well  He lets them Bow to Heav'n and Drink to Hell  If but to Wine and him they Homage pay  He cares not to what Deity they pray  What God they worship most or in what way  Whether by  Luther Calvin  or by  Rome    They sail for Heav'n by Wine he steers them home  Ungovern'd Passion settled first in  France    Where Mankind lives in haste and thrives by Chance  A Dancing Nation Fickle and Untrue  Have oft undone themselves and others too  Prompt the Infernal Dictates to obey  And in Hell's Favour none more great than they  The Pagan World he blindly leads away  And Personally rules with Arbitrary Sway  The Mask thrown off Plain Devil his Title stands  And what elsewhere he Tempts he there Commands  There with full Gust th' Ambition of his Mind  Governs as he of old in Heav'n design'd  Worshipp'd as God his  Painim Altars  smoke  Embru'd with Blood of those that him Invoke  The rest by Deputies he rules as well  And plants the distant Colonies of Hell  By them his secret Power he maintains  And binds the World in his Infernal Chains  By Zeal the  Irish  and the  Rush  by Folly  Fury the  Dane  The  Swede  by Melancholly  By stupid Ignorance the  Muscovite    The  Chinese  by a Child of Hell call'd Wit  Wealth makes the  Persian  too Effeminate  And Poverty the  Tartars  Desperate  The  Turks  and  Moors  by  Mah'met  he subdues  And God has giv'n him leave to rule the  Jews  Rage rules the  Portuguese  and Fraud the  Scotch    Revenge the  Pole  and Avarice

and those the Swains  To ev'ry Barbarous Nation have betray'd her  Who conquer her as oft as they Invade her  So Beauty guarded but by Innocence  That ruins her which should be her Defence  Ingratitude  a Devil of Black Renown  Possess'd her very early for his own  An Ugly Surly Sullen Selfish Spirit  Who Satan's worst Perfections does inherit  Second to him in Malice and in Force  All Devil without and all within him Worse  He made her Firstborn Race to be so rude  And suffer'd her to be so oft subdu'd  By sev'ral Crouds of Wandring Thieves o'errun  Often unpeopl'd and as oft undone  While ev'ry Nation that her Pow'rs reduc'd  Their Languages and Manners introduc'd  From whose mix'd Relicks our compounded Breed  By Spurious Generation does succeed  Making a Race uncertain

Auxiliaries or Slaves of ev'ry Nation  With  Hengist Saxons Danes  with  Sueno  came  In search of Plunder not in search of Fame  Scots Picts  and  Irish  from th'  Hibernian  Shore  And Conqu'ring

William  the Conqueror  Norman  let us know  What Conquerors in AfterTimes might do  To ev'ry  Or  Archer  Musqueteer  he brought to Town  He gave the Lands which never were his own  When first the  English  Crown he did obtain  He did not send his  Dutchmen  home again  No Reassumptions in his Reign were known  D'avenant  might there ha' let his Book alone  No Parliament his Army cou'd disband  He rais'd no Money for he paid in Land  He gave his Legions their Eternal Station  And made them all Freeholders of the Nation  He canton'd out the Country to his Men  And ev'ry Soldier was a Denizen  The Rascals thus enrich'd he call'd them  Lords    To please their Upstart Pride with newmade Words  And  DoomsdayBook  his Tyranny records  And here begins the Ancient Pedigree  That so exalts our Poor Nobility  'Tis that from some  French  Trooper they derive  Who with the  Norman  Bastard did arrive  The Trophies of the Families appear  Some show the Sword the Bow and some the Spear  Which their Great Ancestor forsooth did wear  These in the Heralds Register remain  Their Noble mean Extraction to explain  Yet who the Hero was no Man can tell  Whether a Drummer or a Colonel  The silent Record blushes to reveal  Their Undescended Dark Original  But grant the best How came the Change to pass  A  TrueBorn Englishman  of  Norman  Race  A  Turkish  Horse can show more History  To prove

they were opprest  Their Rights invaded and their Laws supprest  When nicely tender of their Liberty  Lord what a Noise they made of Slavery  In daily Tumults show'd their Discontent  Lampoon'd their King and mock'd his Government  And if in Arms they did not first appear  'Twas want of Force and not for want of Fear  In humbler Tone than  English  us'd to do  At Foreign Hands for Foreign Aid they sue  William  the Great Successor of  Nassau    Their Prayers heard and their Oppressions saw  He saw and sav'd them God and Him they prais'd  To This their Thanks to That their Trophies rais'd  But glutted with their own Felicities  They soon their New Deliverer despise  Say all their Prayers back their Joy disown  Unsing their Thanks and pull their Trophies down▪  Their Harps of Praise are on the Willows hung  For  Englishmen  are ne'er contented long  The Rev'rend Clergy too and who'd ha' thought  That they who had such NonResistance taught  Should e'er to Arms against their Prince be brought  Who up to Heaven did Regal Pow'r advance  Subjecting  English  Laws to Modes of  France    Twisting Religion so with Loyalty  s one cou'd never live and t'other dye  And yet no sooner did their Prince design  Their Glebes and Perquisites to undermine  ut all their Passive Doctrines laid aside  The Clergy their own Principles deny'd  npreach'd their Nonresisting Cant and pray'd  To Heav'n for Help and to the  Dutch  for Aid  The Church chym'd all her Doctrines back again  nd PulpitChampions did the Cause maintain  lew in the Face of all their former Zeal  nd NonResistance did at once repeal  The  Rabbies  say it would be too prolix  To tye Religion up to Politicks  The Church's Safety is  Suprema Lex    nd so by a new Figure of their own  Their former Doctrines all at once disown  s Laws  Post Facto  in the Parliament  urgent Cases have obtain'd Assent  ut are as dangerous Presidents laid by  Made Lawful only by Necessity  The Rev'rend Fathers then in Arms appear  nd Men of God became the Men of War  he Nation fir'd by them to Arms apply  ssault their Antichristian Monarchy  To their due Channel all our Laws restore  nd made things what they shou'd ha' been before  ut when they came to fill the Vacant Throne  nd the Pale Priests look'd back on what they'd done  ow  English  Liberty began to thrive  nd Church of  England  Loyalty outlive  ow all their persecuting Days were done  d their Deliv'rer plac'd upon the Throne▪  The Priests as Priests are wont to do turn'd Tail  They're  Englishmen  and Nature will prevail  Now they deplore the Ruins they ha' made  And murmur for the Master they betray'd  Excuse those Crimes they cou'd not make him mend  And suffer for the Cause they can't defend  Pretend they'd not ha' carry'd things so high  And ProtoMartyrs make for Popery  Had the Prince done as they design'd the thing  Ha' set the Clergy up to rule the King  Taken a Donative for coming hither  And so ha' left their King and them together  We had say they been now a happy Nation  No doubt we had seen a Blessed Reformation  For Wise Men say 't's as dangerous a thing  A Ruling Priesthood as a Priestrid King  And of all Plagues with which Mankind are curst  Ecclesiastick Tyranny's the worst  If all our former Grievances were feign'd  King  James  has been abus'd and we trepann'd  Bugbear'd with Popery and Power Despotick  Tyrannick Government and Leagues Exotick  The Revolution's a Phanatick Plot  W  a Tyrant  S  a Sot  A Factious Army and a Poyson'd Nation  Unjustly forc'd King  James  's Abdication  But if he did the Subjects Rights invade  Then he was punish'd only not betray'd  And punishing of Kings is no such Crime  But  Englishmen  ha' done it many a Time  When Kings the Sword of Justice first lay down  They are no Kings though they possess the Crown  Titles are Shadows Crowns are empty things  The Good of Subjects is the End of Kings  To guide in War and to protect in Peace  Where Tyrants once commence the Kings do cease  For Arbitrary Power's so strange a thing  It makes the Tyrant and unmakes the King  If Kings by Foreign Priests and Armies reign  nd Lawless Power against their Oaths maintain  hen Subjects must ha' reason to complain  If Oaths must bind us when our Kings do ill  o call in Foreign Aid is to rebel  y force to circumscribe our Lawful Prince  wilful Treason in the largest Sense  nd they who once rebel most certainly  heir God and King and former Oaths defy  we allow no MaleAdministration  ould cancel the Allegiance of the Nation  et all our Learned Sons of  Levi  try  his Eccles'astick Riddle to unty  ow they could make a Step to call the Prince  nd yet pretend to Oaths and Innocence  By th' first Address they made beyond the Seas  hey're perjur'd in the most intense Degrees  nd without Scruple for the time to come  May swear to all the Kings in  Christendom    And truly did our Kings consider all  hey'd never let the Clergy swear at all  heir Politick Allegiance they'd refuse  or Whores and Priests will never want excuse  But if the Mutual Contract was dissolv'd  The Doubtss explain'd the Difficulty solv'd  That Kings when they descend to Tyranny  Dissolve the Bond and leave the Subject free  The Government's ungirt when Justice dies  And Constitutions are NonEntities  The Nations all a Mob there's no such thing  As Lords or Commons Parliament or King  A great promiscuous Croud the Hydra lies  Till Laws revive and mutual Contract ties  A Chaos free to chuse for their own share  What Case of Government they please to wear  f to a King they do the Reins commit  All Men are bound in Conscience to submit  But then that King must by his Oath assent  To  Postulata  's of the Government  Which if he breaks he cuts off the Entail  And Power retreats to its Qriginal  This Doctrine has the Sanction of Assent  From Nature's Universal Parliament  The Voice of Nations and the Course of Things  Allow that Laws superiour are to Kings  None but Delinquents would have Justice cease  Knaves rail at Laws as Soldiers rail at Peace  For Justice is the End of Government  As Reason is the Test of Argument  No Man was ever yet so void of Sense  As to debate the Right of SelfDefence  A Principle so grafted in the Mind  With Nature born and does like Nature bind  Twisted with Reason and with Nature too  As neither one nor t'other can undo  Nor can this Right be less when National  Reason which governs one should govern all  Whate'er the Dialect of Courts may tell  He that his Right demands can ne'er rebel  Which Right if 'tis by Governours deny'd  May be procur'd by Force or Foreign Aid  For Tyranny's a Nation's Term for Grief  As Folks cry  Fire  to hasten in Relief  And when the hated Word is heard about  All Men shou'd come to help

PILLORY  LONDON Printed in the Year  The PREFACE  THO' these Sheets have been Wrote several Months and in a time that seem'd to make them something more suitable than now Yet the Occasion renewing it self every day who can refrain from speaking  Had the scribling World been pleas'd to leave me where they found me I had left them and  Newgate  both together and as I am metaphorically Dead had been effectually so as to Satyrs and Pamphlets  'Tis really something hard that after all the Mortification they think they have put upon a poor abdicated Author in their scurrilous Street Ribaldry and Bear Garden Usage some in Prose and some in those terrible Lines they call Verse they cannot yet be quiet but whenever any thing comes out that does not please them I come in for a share in the Answer whatever I did in the Question every thing they think an Author deserves to be abus'd for must be mine  Several plentiful Showers of Railery I have quietly submitted to an thought I had a Talent of Patience as large as might serve me in common with my Neighbours but there is a time when a Man can bear n  longer and if the Man is in a little Passion he thinks he ought to b  born with  I tried Retirement and banish'd my self from the Town I thought as the Boys us'd to say 'twas but fair they should let me alone while did not meddle with them  But neither a Country Recess any more than a Stone Doublet on secure a Man from the Clamour of the Pen  In the following Sheets I endeavour to state the Case in order to Truce for shame Gentlemen let him alone why the Man's Dead 't  a Cowardly Trick to beat a Man when he's down but to fight a Dea  Man is the Devil  And with Submission Gentlemen the Allegory is just for if bei  +tied under Sureties and Penalties not to write at least not to write wh  some People may not like be not equivalent to being Dead as to the P  I know not what is  But how do these People treat Mankind that they pretend to Indict  Man for every thing they please as if they had Power to Read his Cou  +tenance in Letters and swear to a Stile as they would to his Face  'Tis easie to prove the Authors of Books and no Man can be conceal  in such Cases but for a Man to be charged with other Mens Faults w  has too many of his own  is a method newly practis'd and more up  me than any Body and yet the Grief of this Usage does not stick so  upon me but that I may tell my Antagonists  if any think themselv  deserving that Name  that they are very welcome to go on their own w  and use me as they please I shall always be ready to reply or by my  +lence let them see I do not think it worth my while  An  ELEGY  on the  Author  of the TrueBorn  EnglishMan    SATYR sing  Lachrime  thou'rt dead in Law  Thy fatal Hour draws on  The Lines of thine own  Exit  draw  And tell how thou'rt undone  end for the Priest and ask Advice  Reflect upon thy Time mispent  When Wit upon its DeathB  d lies  'Tis high time to repent  What canst thou say old  Pluto  to appease  hy Hymns in that dark World will never please  ilence eternal S  lence is thy Lot  nd all thy Rhymes and all thy Hymns forgot  ury'd in dark Oblivion there thou'lt lie  or seven long Years  a Wit's Eternity    Little thou thought'st in Verses past  hose Songs of thine would be thy last  'Tis hard thy vigorous Muse should lie  all her Strength of Thought condemn'd to dye  Tis hard to have her perish in her Prime  nd most Men think she dy'd before her time  With Patience Satyr to thy Fate submit  nd show thy Courage can outdo thy Wit  With Calmness meet the Sentence of thy Death  nd yield with Temper thy Poetick Breath  hat tho' to Silence they condemn thy Rhymes  en that Silence shall condemn the Times  The World shall blush when e'er they Read  nd thou be still a Satyr tho' thou'rt Dead  When Malefactors come to dye  They claim uncommon Liberty  Freedom of Speech gives no distaste  hey let them talk at large because they talk their last  'Tis hard thy dying Words should give Offence  And neither please in Language nor in Sense  He that must never open more  Dearly attones for what he said before  Departed Satyr  let thy Ghost appear  To keep the vicious Town in fear  Verses shall from thy injur'd Ashes rise  And Satyrs always pointed at their Vice  No Man shall sin in peace  And Virtue only shall thy Shade appease  But since dear Satyr▪ 'tis thy Lot  Thus to dye upon the spot  In softest Notes sing thine own Elegy  Be silent Dead but never silent dye  The  ELEGY    Circled in  Newgate  's cold Embrace  And reconcil'd to Death by such a place  I from the horrid Mansion fled  And  as concerning Poetry  am dead  To seven long Years of silence I betake  Perhaps by then I may forget to speak  And thus I dy'd and yield Satyrick Breath  For to be Dumb  in Poetry is Death    If you demand a Reason of my Fate  Whether it came too soon or came too late  Whether Wise Heaven did this permit  For want of Manners or else for want of Wit  Whether I said too little or too much  Or loaded any with too just Reproach  If you would know the latent Cause  Go search the hidden Secret in the Laws  Let not my Verse my Verses Crimes debate  Go ask the powerful

Jealous it seems my busie Head  Should make me talk when I am dead  Here's all the Reason I can make them give  That tho' the Poet's dead the Man's alive  To which as gravely I have said  That tho' the Man's alive the Poet's dead  He's bad indeed who when he dies  Has none to mourn his Obsequies  And of the Virtuous find me one  But some rejoices when he's gone  So I have Mourners who lament my Verse  And some Triumph upon the Satyr's Hearse  Some think I die without a Crime  Some like my Fate and think 'twas time  But this Just Calculation I can make  And there I think I can't mistake  The Wise and Virtuous Sorrow's Tribute pay  And Vice alone keeps Holyday  This does my Judgment satisfie  For so would every wise Man die  So let the Censure of my Works be past  So let me die when I must die my last  Let wise Mens Sorrow be my Choice  And let the Knaves and Fools rejoice  'Tis true there is some Reason in the case  Vice now has room to shew her Face  or now my walking Ghost is laid

No more disturb the Age  No more the mighty Vices of the mighty Men engage  When Soldiers hasten to dispatch the War  Their Country's Service to their Pay prefer  Cease to give thanks for Victory when they fly  And give Almighty Truth the Lye  As long as Navies Fleets and Men  Come shatter'd home and hasten out again  While they protect our Trade defend our Coast  And bravely fight what e'er it

And duly pay it out again  While needful Charges are defraid  The Navy Mann'd as well as paid  And no Commission Officers presume  To take the Nation's Pay and stay at home  When e'er these happy Articles appear  There'll be no business for a Satyr here  I may lie still without Security  There can be no occasion then for me  I shall have nothing left to say  For this would stop my Mouth  the Shortest Way    I was in hopes with this Poetick Death  Slander would die and let me take some Breath  But Envy never sleeps Report begins  To charge my Memory with my Neighbours sins  As if they had not known  I have too many of my own  They tell me how the Party did combine  To bear my Charges and to pay my Fine  Malice is always Retrograde to Sense  And judges things without their Consequence  Willing her mischievous Intent to show  She always goes too fast or else too slow  They that this empty Notion rais'd  Not me but all the Party Satyriz'd  Since all Men that know how to judge by Rules  Know that the Men they mean were never Fools  And their worst Enemies would never try  To brand them with the blame of Generosity  But to remove this modern Doubt  'll give  five hundred Pound  they'll make it out  Thus like Old  Strephen  's Virtuous Miss  Who foolishly too coy  Dy'd with the scandal of a Whore  And never knew the Joy  So I by Whigs abandon'd bear  The  Satyr  's unjust

hang'd my self  But this and I should think they needs must know it  s not  The Shortest Way  to kill a Poet  In vain they spend their Time and Breath  To make me starve and die a Poet's Death  Butler

freely left to guess  Why I am doom'd to write no more  f something wan't too true I wrote before  Why should they thus deny  To let me write my Truer History  Why seven long Years of Silence now impose  f I had nothing to disclose  Nothing to make appear  Nothing to say they cannot bear to hear  But 'tis enough I lost my Life by Law  And still by Rules am kept in Awe  The Manner all Exact and Regular  Whate'er the Consequences are  Never demand if it were Just  For if the Forms are right the Matter must  Law is a great Machine of State  With Hooks and Screws to make it Operate  Which as they are wound up by Art  With ease perform the Fatal Part  Exactly answer to the Workman's Skill  This way 'twill work to save or that to kill  Crime in this Management has no Concern  No Man can Right from Wrong discern  The Movement is so subtle and so sure  And does such certain Fate procure  The Mathematicks are in vain  Defensive Study useless must remain  This Monster whom it pleases will devour  For Law is but a Heathen Word for Power  A Metaphor invented to confess  The Methods by which Men Oppress  By which with Safety they destroy Mankind  While Justice stands before and Fraud behind  Thousands of little Wheels and unseen Parts  Of perjur'd Promises and wheedling Arts  This mighty Thing compose  And no Man half its crooked Turnings knows  The wild Meanders none can Trace  Nor no Man knows it by its Face  It learns to change with every Turn of Times  And rings the Tune 'tis set to  like the Chimes    'Tis by this Engine I thought fit to die  And so has many a wiser Man than I  And by their broken Promises betray'd  Satyr  is thus upon its DeathBed laid  If e'er I come to Life again  Coleman  for that I'll put no Faith in Man  I that did on fair Quarter yield  Laid down my Arms and left the Field  Did from my own Defence withdraw  Thinking that Honesty was Law  Have lost my Rhiming Life by this Deceit  And I deserve it for my want of Wit  Had I remembred Days of Yore  When we complain'd of Arbitrary Power  When Lawyers were the Tools of State  And hurried Men to hasty Fate  When the great Engine was screw'd up too high  And Men were hang'd they knew not why  Had I remember'd  Scrogg  's Fame  And known that Lawyers are in ev'ry Reign the same  I ne'er had ventur'd to believe  Men whose Profession's to deceive  Memento Mori  here I stand  With Silent Lips but Speaking Hand  A walking Shadow of a Poet  But bound to hold my Tongue and never show it  A Monument of Injury  A Sacrifice to Legal Ty  I beckon to Mankind to have a Care  And pointing tell how I was lost and where  I show the dangerous Shore  Where I have suffer'd Shipwrack just before  If among Poets there remains a Fool  That scorns to take this Notice for a Rule  But ventures the Fidelity  Of those whose Trade and Custom 'tis to L  Let Men no Pity to him show  Let him to  Bedlam  not to  Newgate  go  The STORM An ESSAY  I'M told  for we have News among the Dead    Heaven lately spoke but few knew what it said  The Voice in loudest Tempests spoke  nd Storms which Nature's strong Foundation shook  felt it hither  and I'd have you know  eard the Voice and knew the Language too  Think

State of Death  m whence this  Popish Consequence  I draw  I'm in the  Limbus  of the Law    me be where I will I heard the Storm  m every Blast  it eccho'd thus REFORM    t the mighty Shock and saw the Night  hen Guilt look'd pale and own'd he Fright  And every time the Raging Element  ok  London  's lofty Towers at every Rent  e falling Timbers gave  they cry'd REPENT    I saw when all the stormy Crew  Newly commission'd from on high  Newly instructed what to do  In Lowring Cloudy Troops drew nigh  They hover'd o'er the guilty Land  As if they had been backward to obey  As if they wondred at the sad Command  And pity'd those those they shou'd destroy  But Heaven that long had gentler Methods tried  And saw those gentler Methods all defied  Had now resolv'd to be obey'd  The Queen an Emblem of the  soft still Voice    Had told the Nation how to make their Choice  Told them the only way to Happiness  Was by the Blessed Door of Peace  But the unhappy Genius of the Land  Deaf to the Blessing as to the Command  Scorn to the high Caution and contemn the News  And all the blessed Thoughts of Peace refuse  Since Storms are then the Nation's Choice  Be Storms their Portion said the Heavenly Voice  He said and I could hear no more  So soon th' obedient Troops began to roar  So soon the blackning Clouds drew near  And fill'd with loudest Storms the trembling Air  I thought I felt the World's Foundation shake  And lookt when all the wondrous Frame would break  I trembl'd as the Winds grew high  And so did many a braver Man than I  For he whose Valour scorns his Sence  Has chang'd his Courage into Impudence  Man may to Man his Valour show  And 'tis his Vertue to do so  But if he's of his Maker nor afraid  He's not courageous then but mad  Soon as I heard the horrid Blast  And understood how long 'twould last  View'd all the Fury of the Element  Consider'd well by whom 'twas sent  And  unto whom  for Punishment  It brought my Hero to my Mind  William  the

DEATH  IN those cold Climates where the Sun appears  Unwillingly and hides his Face in Tears  A dreadful Vale lies in a Desert Isle  On which indulgent Heaven did never smile  There a thick Grove of Aged Cypress Trees  Which none without an awful horror sees  Into its wither'd Arms depriv'd of Leaves  Whole Flocks of illpresaging Birds receives  Poisons are all the Plants the Soil will bear  And Winter is the only Season there  Millions of Graves cover the spacious Field  And Springs of Blood a thousand Rivers yield  Whose Streams opprest with Carcasses and Bones  Instead of gentle Murmurs pour forth Groans  Within this Vale a famous Temple stands  Old as the World it self which it commands  Round is its Figure and four Iron Gates  Divide Mankind by order of the Fates  There come in Crouds doom'd to one common Grave  The Young the old the Monarch and the Slave  Old Age and Pains which Mankind most deplores  Are faithful Keepers of those sacred Doors  All clad in mournful Blacks which also load  The sacred Walls of this obscure Abode  And Tapers of a pitchy Substance made  With Clouds of Smoak increase the dismal Shade  A Monster void of Reason and of Sight  The Goddess is who sways this Realm of Night  Her Power extends o'er all Things that have Breath  A cruel Tyrant and her Name is  Death    The fairest Object of our wond'ring Eyes  Was newly offer'd up her Sacrifice  The adjoining Places where the Altar stood  Yet blushing with the fair  Almeria  's Blood  When griev'd  Orontes  whose unhappy Flame  Is known to all that e'er converse with Fame  His Mind possest by Fury and Despair  Within the Sacred Temple made this Prayer  Great Deity  Who in thy Hands do'st bear  That trusty Scepter which poor Mortals fear  Who wanting Eyes thy self respectest none  And neither spares the Laurel nor the Crown  Oh thou whom all Mankind in vain withstands  Each of whose Blood must one day stain thy Hands  Oh thou who every Eye which sees the Light  Closest again in an Eternal Night  Open thy Ears and hearken to my Grief  To which thy only Power can give Relief  I come not hither to prolong my Fate  But wish my wretched Life a shorter Date  And that the Earth would in its Bowels hide  A Wretch whom Heaven invades on every side  That from the sight of Day I could remove  And might have nothing left me but my Love  Thou only Comforter of Minds opprest  The Port

their frail and mortal State forgot  Before thy Altars are not to be brought  Without Constraint the noise of dying Rage  Heaps of the Slain of every Sex and Age  The Blade all reeking in the Gore it shed  With sever'd Arms confus'dly spread  The Rapid Flames of a perpetual Fire  The Groans of Wretches ready to expire  This Tragick Scene makes them in Terror live  Till that is forc'd which they should freely give  Yielding unwillingly what Heaven will have  Their Fears eclipse the Glory of their Grave  Before thy Face they make undecent Moan  And feel a hundred Deaths in fearing one  The flame becomes unhallow'd in their Breast  And he a Murtherer who was a Priest  His Hands profan'd in breaking Nature's Chain  By which the Body does the Soul detain  But against me thy strongest Forces call  And on my Head let all the Tempest fall  No shrinking back shall any weakness shew  And calmly I'll expect the fatal blow  My Limbs not trembling in my mind no fear  Plaints in my Mouth nor in my Eyes a Tear  Think not that time our wonted sure relief  That universal Cure for every grief  Whose Aid so many Lovers oft have found  With like success can ever heal my wound  Too weak's

Paris  the Queen of Cities does contain  The fairest Town the largest and the best  So fair  Almeria  shin'd above the rest  From her bright Eyes to feel a hopeless flame  Was of our Youth the most ambitious aim  Her Chains were marks of Honour to the brave  She made a Prince whene'er she made a Slave  Love under whose Tyrannick power I groan  Shew'd me this Beauty e'er 'twas fully blown  Her tim'rous charms and her unpractis'd look  Their first assurance from my Conquest took  By wounding me she learnt the fatal Art  And the first sigh she had was from my heart  My Eyes with Tears moist'ning her snowy Arms  Render'd the Tribute owing to her Charms  But as I soonest of all Mortals paid  My Vows and to her Beauty Altars made  So among all those Slaves that sigh'd in vain  She thought me only worthy of my Chain  Love's heavy Burthen my Submissive Heart  Endur'd not long before she bore her part  My violent flame melted her frozen Breast  And in soft Sighs her Pity she exprest  Her gentle Voice allay'd my raging Pains  And her fair hands sustain'd me in my Chains  Even Tears of Pity waited on my moan  And tender Looks were cast on me alone▪  My hopes and dangers were less mine than hers  Those fill'd her Soul with Joys and these with Fears  Our hearts united had the same desires  And both alike burn'd in impatient Fires  Too faithful Memory I give thee Leave  Thy wretched Master kindly to deceive  Make me not once Possessor of her Charms  Let me not find her languish in my Arms  Past Joys are now my Fancies mournful Theams  Make all my happy Nights appear but Dreams  Let not that Bliss before my Eyes be brought  Oh hide those Scenes from my tormenting Thought  And in their place disdainful Beauty shew  If thou would'st not be cruel make her so  And something to abate my deep Despair  Oh let her seem less Gentle or less Fair  But I in vain flatter my wounded Mind  Never was Nymph so lovely or so Kind  No cold Repulses my Desires supprest  I seldom sigh'd but on  Almeria  's Breast  Of all the Passions which Mankind destroy  I only felt Excess of Love and Joy  Numberless Pleasures charm'd my Sense and they  Were as my Love without the least Allay  As pure alas but not so sure to last  For like a pleassing Dream they all are past  From Heav'n her Beauty like fierce Light'ning came  Which breaks thro' Darkness with its glorious Flame  A while it shines a while our Sight it chears  But soon the shortliv'd Comfort disappears  And Thunder follows whose resistless Rage  None can withstand and nothing can asswage  So oft the Light which those bright Flashes gave  Serves only to conduct us to our Grave  When I had just begun Loves's Joys to taste  Those full Rewards for Fears and Dangers past  A Fever seiz'd her and to nothing

with Piety  But that which does yet more perplex my mind  To love her truly I must seem unkind  So unconcern'd a Face my Sorrow wears  I must restrain unruly floods of Tears  My Eyes and Tongue put on dissembling forms  I shew a calmness in the midst of Storms  I seem to hope when all my hopes are gone  And almost dead with Grief discover none  But who can long deceive a loving Eye  Or with dry Eyes behold his Mistress die  When Passion had with all his Terrors brought  Th'approaching danger nearer to my thought  Off on a sudden fell the forc'd disguise  And shew'd a sighing heart in weeping

our gracious Queen  Our Lives and Safeties all  A woful Fight of late there did  Near  Andenard  befal  To drive the  French  with Sword and Gun  Brave  Marlborough  took his way  Ah wo the time that  France  beheld  The Fighting of that day  The Valiant Duke to Heaven had swore  Vendome  should pay full dear  For  Ghent  and  Bruges  e're his Fame  Should reach his master's Ear  And now with Eighty Thousand bold  And chosen men of might  He with the  French  began to wage  A sharp and bloody fight  The Gallant  Britains  swiftly ran  The  French  away to chase  On  Wednesday  they began to fight  When Daylight did decrease  And long before highNight they had  Ten thousand  Frenchmen  slain  And all the Rivers Crimson flow'd  As they were dy'd in grain  The  Britains  thro' the Woods pursu'd  The nimble  French  to take  And with their Cries the Hills and Dales  And every Tree did shake  The Duke then to the Wood did come  In hopes  Vendome  to meet  When lo the Prince of  Carignan  Fell at his Grace's Feet  Oh gentle Duke forbear forbear  Into that Wood to shoot  If ever pity mov'd your Grace  But turn your Eyes and look  See where the Royal Line of  France    Great  Lewis  's Heirs do lie  And sure a Sight more piteous was  Ne're seen by mortal Eye  What Heart of Flint but must relent  Like Wax before the Sun  To see their Glory at an end  E're yet it was begun  When as our General found your Grace  Wou'd needs begin to fight  As thinking it wou'd please the Boys  To see so fine a Sight  He straitway sent them to the top  Of yonder Church's Spire  Where they might see and yet be safe  From Swords and Guns and Fire  But first he took them by the Hand  And kiss'd them e're they went  Whilst Tears stood in their little Eyes  As if they knew the Event  Then said he would with speed return  Soon as the Fight was done  But when he saw his men give ground  Away he basely run  And left these Children all alone  As Babes wanting Relief  And long they wandred up and down  No hopes to chear their grief  Thus hand in hand they walked till  At last this Wood they spy'd  And when they say the Night grow dark  They here lay down and cry'd  At this the Duke was inly mov'd  His Breast soft pity beat  And so he streightway ordered  His men for to retreat  And now but that my Pen is blunt  I might with ease relate  How Fifteen Thousand  French  were took  Besides what found their Fate  Nor shou'd the Prince of  Hanover  In Silence be forgot  Who like a Lyon fought on foot  After his Horse was shot  And what strange Chance likewise befel  Unto these Children dear  But that your Patience is too much  Already tir'd I fear  And so God bless the Queen and Duke  And send a lasting Peace  That Wars and foul Debate henceforth  In all the World may cease

Council waited at her Tent  To understand the Message she had sent  A goodly Frame rais'd high of carved wood  Leaning its lofty Head on Pillars stood  Near an old venerable Pile  VVestminster    Adorn'd with curious work of antique Hands  There all the States in full Assembly met  Where they in Princely Robes of Scarlet sit  Shining in costly Gems each takes his place  And fills the Senate with Majestick Grace  There hangs the Ballance of the weighty State  And there Rewards and Punishments do wait  A rigorous or an equitable Fate  There arbitrary Laws are curb'd and chain'd  And there the summit of all Justice gain'd  Judges themselves if Lawless are not free  From this tribunal Seat of Equity  Just Judgment there does without Brib'ry reign  And wholsome Laws all Violence restrain  Bless'd Liberty in Triumph sits her down  Nor hurts the State nor shakes the Imperial Crown  All now were met the Council fill'd apace  And ev'ry Statesman took his wonted Place  VVhen thus the Queen began  My Lords the Cause why you're assembl'd here  'S to advise about the Business of the VVar  Louis  you know his Threatnings spreads around  And Victory has sometime his Armies crown'd  The slavish  French  deflow'r their Neighbours Fields  Whilst tamely they to their Incursions yields  And  Japhet  's Race with heavy Burdens bent  The Spaniards    Submit to haughty  Louis  's Government  The Might of this great Prince I need not tell  Or all his vast Designs you know too well  Europe  has felt the Fury of his Pow'r  VVhen God like  William  rescu'd you before  But now more potent by his Allies grown  He triumphs e're the Battel is begun  VVhile all his num'rous Squadrons do prepare  For dreadful mischief and destructive VVar  Whom shall I chuse among my mighty Men  The Hazard of a Battel to sustain  Who dare 'gainst  Burgundy  his Courage try  To conquer bravely or as bravely die  Then a bold  Britain  answer'd thus and said  Churchill  is only fit for such a Head  Who has th'illustrious Chiefs of  Europe  led  And often for his Country's Honour Bled  Courage and Conduct both in him remains  By wise designs as well as Blood he gains  For he that singly does to Battel go  With Courage only beats but half his Foe  Mature in Councils Generals ought to be  Not fill'd with Fire so much as Policy  For Life's of more Concern than Victory  Then  Marlbro'  humbly spoke  Great Princess and you Lords of  Britain  hear  Who make  Europe  's Concern your constant Care  You may remember when her Armies fled  And  German  Princes stood like Statues dead  hen  Churchill  propt that proud ungrateful Race  That now in  Britain Marlbro'  would disgrace  Oh' hear me Lords spare your Reproaches now  Did not all  Europe  to proud  Louis  bow  Did not they cringe below the Tyrant's Feet  And to the Laws his Arms prescribe submite  What then has  Marlbro'  done Do  British  Peers  Despise the Man that has dispell'd their Fears  Not for my Self did I this Honour seek  My Country's Danger 'twas that made me speak  But since I find in faithless  Britain  few  When pressing Dangers call that dare be true  I shall my Courage for the future spare  Cowards can boast when Dangers seem not near  With that a noble Peer tho' young yet wise  Stood up and thus in Council did advise  Tho' grey Experience has not reach'd my Years  Nor have I been alarm'd with foreign Fears  Yet I am sensible all  Europe  's Fate  Does much on our wise Councils wait  Great Britain  's Safety in our Conduct lies  And Strength is nothing if we are not wise  Therefore my Lords I must my Judgment give  For  Marlbro'  which I hope you'll all receive  Then all the Council mov'd with willing Ears  Attended to the Wisdom of his Years  While thus the noble Youth continu'd on  The brave Discourse he had so well begun  I am amaz'd from this wise Board to hear  One Soul of ancient  British  Race appear  Gainst  Marlbro'  Did he not all  Europe  save  Are not his Looks his Words his

Why her Favours lofe  Who such vast Bounties on her Land bestows  Since  Marlbro'  is the Man by Heav'n decred  Anna  no more shall frown or  Marlbro'  bleed  For if nor Heav'n nor yet the Queen had

joyn'd  Who could the power of such Temptations shun  What frozen  Synick  from her Charms could run  What Cloister'd Monk could see a Face so bright  But quit his Beads and follow Beauty's Light  And Its Lustre hope to shun Eternal Night  so bewitch'd and poyson'd with her Charms  Believ'd the utmost Heaven was in her Arms  Methoughts the Goodness in her Eyes I see  Spoke her the Offspring of some Deity  Now Books and Walks would no content afford  She was the only Good to be Ador'd  In her fair Looks alone delight I found  Love's raging Storms all other Joys had drown'd  By Beauty's  Ignus fatuus  led astray  Bound for Content I lost my happy way  Of Reason's faithful Pilot now bereft  Was amongst Rocks and Shelves in danger left  There must have perish'd as I fondly thought  Lest her kind Usage my Salvation wrought  Her happy Aid I labour'd to obtain  Hop'd for Success yet fear'd her sad Disdain  Tortur'd like dying Convicts whilst they live  'Twixt fear of Death and hopes of a Reprieve  First for her smallest Favours did I sue  Crept Fawn'd and Cring'd as Lovers us'd to do  Sigh'd e'er I spoke and when I spoke look'd  In words confus'd disclos'd my mournful T  le  Unpractised and Amour's fine Speeches co  d  But could not utter what I well design  d  Warm'd by her Charms against Bash  strove  And trembling sat and stammer'd out my Love  Told her how greatly I admir'd and fear  d  Which she 'twixt Coyness and Compassion hear'd  Grutch'd no Expence of Money or of Time  And thought that not to adore her was a Crime  The more each Visit I acquainted grew  Yet every time found something in her new  Who was above her Sex so fortunate  She had a Charm for Man in every State  Beauty for the Youthful Prudence for the Old  Scripture for the Godly for the Miser Gold  Wit for the Ingenious silence for the Grave  Flatt'ry for the Fool and Cunning for the Knave  Compounded thus of such Varieties  She had a knack to every Temper please  And as her self thought fit was every one of these  I lov'd I sigh'd and vow'd talk'd whin'd and pray'd  And at her Feet my panting Heart I lay'd  She smil'd then frown'd was now reserv'd then fre  And as she play'd her part oft chang'd her Key  Not through Fantastick Humour but Design  To try me throughly e'er she should be mine  Because she wanted in one Man to have  A Husband Lover Cuckold and a Slave  So Travellers before a Horse they buy  His Speed his Paces and his Temper try  Whether h'ell answer Whip and Spur thence Judge  If the poor Beast will prove a patient Drudge  When she by wiles had heightned my Desire  And fain'd Lov's sparkles to a raging Fire  Made now for Wedlock or for  Bedlam  fit  Thus Passion gain'd the upperhand of Wit  The Dame by pity or by Interest mov'd  Or else by Lust pretended now she lov'd  After long sufferings her Consent I got  To make me happy as I hop'd and thought  But oh the wretched hour I ty'd the  Gordian  Knot  Thus through mistake I rashly plung'd my Life  Into that Gulph of Miseries a Wife  With joyful Arms I thus embrac'd my Fate  Believ'd too soon was undeceiv'd too late  So hairbrain'd Fools to  Indian  Climates rove  With a vain hope their Fortunes to improve  There spend their slender Cargoes then become  Worse Slaves abroad than e'er they were at home  When a few Weeks were wasted I compar'd  With all due moderation and regard  My former freedom with my new restraint  Judging which State afforded most content  But found a single Life as calm and gay  As the delightful Month of blooming  May    Not chil'd with Cold or scorch'd with too much heat  Not plagu'd with flying Dust nor drown'd with wet  But pleasing to the Eyes and to the Nostrils sweet  But Wedlock's like the blustring Month of  March    That does the Body's Maims and Bruises search  Brings by cold nipping Storms unwelcom Pains  And finds or breeds Distempers in our Veins  Renews old Sores and hastens on Decay  And seldom does affords one pleasant Day  But Clouds dissolve or raging Tempest blow  And untile Houses like the wrangling Shrow  Thus  March  and Marriage justly may be said  To be alike then sure the Man is Mad  That loves such changling Weather where the best is bad  Though I once happy in a single Life  Yet Shipwrack'd all upon that Rock a Wife  By Gold and Beauties Powerful Charms betray'd  To the dull drudgery of a MarriageBed  That Paradise for Fools a Sport for Boys  Tiresom its Chains and brutal are its Joys  Thou nauseous Priestcraft that too soon appear'd  Not as I hop'd but worse than what I fear'd  All her soft Charms which I believ'd divine  Marriage I thought had made them only mine  Vain hope alas for I too early found  My Brows were with the Throne of Wedlock crown'd  Jealousies first from Reason rais'd a doubt  And Fatal Chance th' unhappy Truth brought out  Made it so plain from all Pretences free'd  That wicked Woman no Excuse could plead  And if she wants device to hide her Shame  Hell can no Umbrage for Adult'ry frame  I thought it prudence the Disgrace to hide  Tho' rav'd and Storm'd she Pardon beg'd and Cry'd  Yet with false Protestations strove to Charm  The Cuckold to believe she'd done no harm  Tho' taken by surprize O curse the Day  Where all the Marks of past Enjoyment lay  And she disorder'd by her lustful freeks  Had Shame and Horrour strugling in her Cheeks  Yet made Essays to cleer her Innocence  And hide her guilt with Lyes and Impudence  For lustful Women like a vicious State  Oft stifle Ills by others full as great  But I convinc'd too plainly of her Guilt  All her false Oaths and quick inventions spoilt  Which when she'd used in vain she blush'd and cry'd  And own'd her fault she found she could not hide  This I forgave she promis'd to reclaim  Vow'd future truth if I'd conceal the shame  But what Strange Adamantine Chain can bind  Woman corrupted to be just or kind  Or how can Man to an adultress shew  That Love which to a faithful Wife is due  I strugled hard and all my Passions checkt  And chang'd Revenge into a mild Respect  That Good for Ill return'd might touch her near  And Gratitude might bind her more than fear  My former Love I every day renew'd  And all the Signals of Oblivion shew'd  Wink'd at small Faults wou'd no such Trifles mind  As accidental Failings not designed  I all things to her Temper easie made  Scorn'd to reflect and hated to upbraid  She chose and rich it was her own Attire  Nay had what a proud Woman could desire  Thus the new Covenant I strictly kept  And oft in private for her Failings wept  Yet bore with seeming Cheerfulness those Cares  That bring a Man too soon to grisled Hairs  But all this kindness I dispens'd in vain  Where Lust and base Ingratitude remain  Lust which if once in Female fancy fix'd  Burns like Salt Petre with dry Touchwood mix'd  And tho' cold Fear for time may stop its force  'Twill soon like Fire confin'd break out the worse  Or like a Tide obstructed reassume its course  No Art cou'd e'er presume the stincking  Stote    Or change the lecherous Nature of the  Goat    No skilful Whitster ever found the slight  To wash or bleach an  Ethiopian  White  No gentle Usage truly will Asswage  A Tyger's fierceness or a Lyon's rage  Stripes and severe Correction is the way  When once they're thro'ly Conquer'd they'll obey  'Tis Whip and Spur Commanding Reign and Bit  That makes the unruly headstrong Horse submit  So stubborn faithless Woman must be us'd  Or Man by Woman basely be abus'd  For after all the Endearments I should show  At last she turn'd both Libertine and Shrow  From my Submission grew perverse and proud  Crabbed as Varges and as Thunder loud  Did what she pleas'd would no Obedience own  And ridicul'd the Patience I had shown  Fear'd no sharp threatnings valued no disgrace  But flung the wrongs she'd done me in my Face  Grew still more headstrong turbulent and Lewd  Filling my Mansion with a spurious brood  Thus Brutal Lust her humane Reason drown'd  And her loose Tail oblig'd the Country round  Advice Reproof Pray'rs Tears were flung away  For still she grew more wicked ev'ry day  Till by her equals scorn'd my Servants fed  The Brutal Rage of her adultrous bed  Nay

Sympathizing Swain  Alexis  Ah  Thyrsis  hast thou heard the dismal Tale  ow  Daphnis  dy'd in yonder Gloomy Vale  could'st thou think that he whose Verse could move  Rock to Pity or a Stone to Love  ho could like  Ovid  tend'rest Thoughts instill  ould fall a Victim to a Woman's Will  Thyrsis  Yes Shepherd yes the Story is too true  Look how the Groves have chang'd their verdant Hue  The wither'd Leaves he scatter'd all around  And blasted Flow'rs disgrace the Sacred Ground  Yes he is dead the poor unhappy Swain  Lov'd beauteous  LALAGE  but lov'd in vain  Fantastick proud and conscious of her Charms  She scorn'd his Love and fled his wishing Arms  Nought cou'd prevail tho' all Love's Arts he try'd  She sacrific'd the Shepherd to her Pride  Ungentle Nymph to thee we owe his Death  'Twas  LALAGE  that rob'd poor  Daphnis  of his Breath  Alexis  Ah cruel Nymph we've lost the learned'st Swa  That ever sung on our  Arcadia  's Plain  What sprightly Thoughts what Joy did he inspire  When with such Art he touch'd the  Roman  Lyre  What tender Pity did our Souls invade  When he bewail'd the Royal  Grecian  Maid  How well his Muse the Fatal Story told  When she the poor  Lucretia  's Fate condol'd  When  Daphnis  Sung how did our Groves rejoyce  And Grotto's Eccho to his charming Voice  How slow did silent  Ousa  roll along  When  Daphnis  taught us great  Lucretia  's Song  Where wand'ring Atoms in Confusion hurl'd  Agreed by Chance and so compos'd a World  Whilst Nervous Numbers with harmonious Feet  In such a soft and tuneful Cadence meet  As to his lasting Honour fully prove  Chance could not in such Beauteous Order move  Then Cruel Nymph how could thy Pride refuse  So soft a Lover and so sweet a Muse  Had'st thou but yielded to our  Daphnis  Love  On every Green in every blooming Grove  The Nymphs and Swains had blest thy happy Name  And  LALAGE  and  Daphnis  fill'd the Mouth of Fam  But now both Nymphs and Swains unite their Breath  To Curse thy Scorn and mourn the Shepherd's Death  Whose Shade now wand'ring in the pensive Grove  till still complains of  LALAGE  and Love  Daphnis  farewel farewel unhappy Swain  May'st thou in  Lethe  's Lake forget thy Pain  nd in Oblivion sleep till thou no more  Remember what thou did'st or what thou wert before  Thyrsis  See yonder Sheep how ragged now and bare  happy Flock whilst they were  Daphnis  Care  ut now they mope and straggling o'er the Plain  Lament all Day and mourn their absent Swain  No more they Joy to crop the tender Buds  Nor seek at Noon cool Springs and shady Woods  n neither Sun nor Shade they now delight  Nor dread the Foxes or the Wolves by Night  Here pin'd to Death a harmless Lambkin lies  nd there for Grief his bleating Mother dies  s if she did with her departing Breath  nvoke just Heaven t'avenge her Master's Death  Alexis  And  Pan  will sure revenge the Shepherd's Fate  ltho' perhaps his Vengeance comes but late  Last Night returning home in yonder Grove  Where we were us'd to sing and talk of Love  heard great  Pan  and all the Sylvan Train  Of  Daphnis  Love and  Daphnis  Death complain  The weeping Heav'ns a Shower of Tears distill'd  And all the Woods were with loud Sorrow fill'd  Whilst mournful Ecchoes all their Sighs rebound  Wishing they had been something more than Sound  Pan  most of all the Shepherd's Death deplor'd  He  Daphnis  lov'd and  Daphnis  him ador'd  Oh my dear Boy he cry'd why would'st thou dar  To view a Face so tempting and so Fair  Why why didst thou indulge the secret Fire  Ah why would'st thou admit the  ond Desire  And hope th' imperious  LALAGE  to move  Why didst thou die alas why didst thou Love  But 'tis in vain to ask 'twas so decreed  So I coy  Syrinx  chas'd and caught a trembling Reed  Fair Fatal Sex who can our Souls surprize  With tender Looks and soft bewitching Eyes  Were you but half as pitiful and kind  The God of Love had not been counted blind  On you we Gaze and feel a pleasing Pain  Steal to our Hearts and glide thro' every Vein  Till drunk with Love our Weakness we betray  And die if you refuse to yield the Joy  More had he spoke but Words began to fail  And breathless Ecchoes murmur'd in the Vale  Convulsive Sorrow swell'd his throbbing Breast  Adieu adieu he cry'd and sigh'd the rest  Thyrsis  But say what Chance what luckless Fortune die  The scornful Virgin to the Shepherd's View  Where did his fatal Passion first begin  Ah Where was she by wretched  Daphnis  seen  Alexis  Beneath a Shade to shun the Heat of Day  On  Ousa  's flow'ry Banks our  Daphnis  lay  Whilst his glad Flocks around their Master feed  Charm'd with the Musick of his Voice and Reed  Of  Chaos  first he sung and boundless Space  Before the Birth of Matter Time or Place  Before Old Night had felt the piercing Ray  Of Light and yielding to invading Day  Then how the wondrous Universe began  What Order thro' the newmade Structure ran  The Birth of Nature and the Birth of Man  Then chang'd his Subject and in softer Strains  Discover'd  Grecian  Loves to  British  Swains  Whilst  LALAGE  from an adjacent Glade  Where trembling Boughs compos'd a moving Shade  With Pleasure listen'd to his warbling Airs  And drunk the pleasing Tales with greedy Ears  Then o'er the Lawns she trips with nimble Feet  To know who 'twas sung so divinely Sweet  And as she pass'd along th' impatient Maid  With curious Eyes each secret Place survey'd  Still following Eccho as a faithful Guide  Till she at distance had the Shepherd spy'd  Thyrsis  Ah happy Swain  Hadst thou but fled from that unhappy Place  And never seen her fair enchanting Face  Thou yet hadst been the Lord of all our Plains  And we yet heard thy soft harmonious Strains  Alexis  But  Daphnis  to his Fate with Pleasure run  He saw the Nymph he lov'd and was undone  With haughty Looks and a disdainful Mien  Apace she walk'd and cross'd the shaded Green  The Shepherd view'd her as she pass'd along  Drop'd down his Reed and strait forgot his Song  With wishing Eyes he gaz'd upon her Charms  And wou'd have dy'd t' have dy'd within her Arms  Deep Draughts of Love he drunk and strong Desire  His Breast like  Aetna  glow'd with inward Fire  Which when the Nymph perceiv'd more proud and coy  She look'd and smil'd with a malicious Joy  Nor could he since the cruel Tyrant move  Obdurate Maid to Pity or to Love  The sad the direful Passion still increas'd  Ten Thousand raging Thoughts distract his Breast  His Flock and darling Muse no longer were  His dear Delight his Pleasure and his Care  The Nymph the Nymph he thinks of nought but her  But hapless Youth  The more he lov'd the more she scorn'd his Flame  And seem'd to hate both Love and  Daphnis  Name  Then from our Groves to yonder Wood he flies  Strange Power of Love and there despairing dies  Thyrsis  The last time I the wretched Swain beheld  Was on a Sunny Bank in  Aegon  's Field  All Fire himself he minded not to shun  The Heat of Day or fly the scorching Sun  Wildly he star'd his Face look'd pale and wan  He sigh'd and languish'd like a dying Man  When to him thus I spoke  Uhappy Youthand can there be no Cure  What Tortures dost thou feel what Pains endure  Whilst by a cruel unrelenting Maid  Thou art to Misery and Death betray'd  Ah canst thou not forget her fatal Charms  And take some kinder Beauty to thy Arms  Return return to our abandon'd Grove  And there thou may'st be happy in thy Love  For thee in amorous Fires  Lycoris  burns  For thee the lovely  Galatea  mourns  Wer't thou from this inglorious Bondage free  A Thousand Blessings wait to fall on thee  The Jolly Troops that us'd to hear thy Lays  And crown thy Brows with Wreaths of verdant Bays  In Sighs and Tears of thy hard Fate complain  Begging kind Heav'n to break the subtle Chain  Which holds thy Heart and thy sweet Muse restore  That thou may'st charm them as thou didst before  Thy scatter'd Flocks too o'er the Forests roam  Wanting their Shepherd to compel them home  Rise then dear  Daphnis  give this Fondness o'er  And think of cruel  LALAGE  no more  Thus Iand thus reply'd the sighing Swain  Ah  Thyrsis  if thou would'st remove my Pain  Give me my Love so I may sooth my Grief  Forget my Cares and grow more fond of Life▪  For tho' so proud disdainful and unkind  Without her I can hope no Peace to find  My wand'ring Thoughts her Form do's still pursue  And still my Soul has  LALAGE  in view  Ah savage Fair would'st thou this Bounty give  For since thou wilt not Love I cannot Live  Would'st thou but deign to close my trembling Eyes  Or drop a Tear or two as  Daphnis  dies  With Joy I'd meet the cold Embrace of Death  And bless my Charmer with my latest Breath  Didst thou but Rage with such a fierce Desire  I'd rush thro' foaming Seas and Storms of Fire  ttempt the greatest Dangers and not grieve  To part with Life so  LALAGE  might Live  But thou malicious Fair one with Disdain  Laughs at my Grief and smiling mock'st my Pain  Be gone ye Quacks your Arts no longer boast  n spight of all your Med'cines I am lost  Be gone ye Cheats who with vain Charms pretend  To make departed Shades again ascend  Be gone ye Zealots who at Altars bow  The Gods are deaf and cannot hear you now  rave I rage I burn oh let me fly  To some dark desart Place and there I'll die  Thus spoke the Swain and acted as he said  Raving to yonder gloomy Wood he fled  Where for a while with piercing Sighs and Groans  He fills the Shades and his dire Fate bemoans  Repeating still the cruel Charmer's Name  And on each Tree records his hapless Flame  Till quite o'erwhelm'd with Woe and drown'd in Grief  He thus gave up the sad remains of Life  Farewel ye Swains to Death's dark Courts I go  To mourn amongst the weeping Shades below  Farewel ye Streams and conscious Groves he cry'd  So did the dreadful Work of Fate and dy'd  Alexis  Unhappy Youth What could the Fates design  To bless the World with such a Muse as thine  Yet suffer Death to ravish her away  'er she could half her smiling Charms display  What Star what baleful Planet rul'd thy Birth  hedding malignant Rays upon the Earth  That thou should'st die amidst thy Vernal Bloom  efore thy Muse had brought her Harvest home  But 'twas a dismal sad untimely Death  That robb'd so soon the Shepherd of his Breath  Thus blooming Trees are nipt with killing Frost  Thus budding Flow'rs harsh Mildews often blast  Hadst thou surviv'd what Wonders had we seen  What list'ning Crouds had throng'd each Grove and Green  Upon thy Voice the Nymphs and Swains had hung  As when before great  Tyt'rus  sweetly sung  Thyrsis  But  Tytyrus  is gone and  Daphnis  fled  And all our Hopes are with the Shepherds dead  Farewel dear Youth so fast my Tears do flow  That Words are wanting to express my Woe  As  Hebrus  stop'd for Grief his golden Side  When on its Banks the tuneful  Orpheus  dy'd  So do our Groves and Rivers seem to mourn  In silent Sorrow for their Swains return  But thou can'st ne'er return  For thou hast cross'd th' irreameable Lake  And  Chaeron  's Boat comes always empty back  Here did the Swains their mournful Theme give o'er  Sighs stop'd their Words and they could speak no more  THE Despairing Lover  WIth inauspicious Love a wretched Swain  Pursu'd the fairest Nymph of all the Plain  Fairest indeed but prouder far than fair  he plung'd him hopeless in a deep Despair  Her Heavenly Form too haughtily she priz'd  His Person hated and his Gifts despis'd  Nor knew the Force of  Cupid  's cruel Darts  Nor fear'd his awful Pow'r on humane Hearts  But either from her hopeless Lover fled  Or with disdainful Glances shot him dead  No Kiss no Look to cheer the drooping Boy  No Word she spoke she scorn'd ev'n to deny  But as a hunted Panther casts about  Her glaring Eyes and pricks her list'ning Ears to scour  o she to shun his Toils her Cares imploy'd  And fiercely in her savage Freedom joy'd  Her Mouth she writh'd her Forehead taught to frown  Her Eyes to sparkle fires to Love unknown  Her sallow Cheeks her envious Mind did show  nd every Feature spoke aloud the Curstness of a Shrew  Yet cou'd not he his obvious Fate escape  His Love still dress'd her in a pleasing Shape  nd every sullen Frown and bitter Scorn  But fann'd the Fuel that too fast did burn  Long time unequal to his mighty Pain  He strove to curb it but he strove in vain  At last his Woes broke out and begg'd Relief  With Tears the dumb Petitioners of Grief  With Tears so tender as adorn'd his Love  And any Heart but only hers wou'd move  Trembling before her bolted Doors he stood  And there pour'd out th' uprofitable Flood  Staring his Eyes and haggard was his Look  Then kissing first the Threshold thus he spoke  Ah Nymph more cruel than of humane Race  Thy Tygress Heart belies thy Angel Face  Too well thou show'st thy Pedigree from Stone  Thy Grandames was the first by  Pyrrha  thrown  Wnworthy thou to be so long desir'd  But so my Love and so my Fate requir'd  I beg not now for 'tis in vain to live  But take this Gift the last that I can give  This friendly Cord shall soon decide the Strife  Betwixt my ling'ring Love and loathsome Life  This Moment puts an end to all my Pain  I shall no more despair nor thou disdain  Farewel Ungrateful and Unkind I go  Condemn'd by thee to those sad Shades below  I go th' extreamest Remedy to prove  To drink Oblivion and to drench my Love  There happily to lose my long Desires  But ah what Draught so deep to quench my Fires  Farewel ye never opening Gates ye Stones  And Threshold guilty of my Midnight Moans  What I have suffer'd here you know too well  What I shall do the Gods and I can tell  The Rose is fragrant but it fades in time  The Violet sweet but quickly past the Prime  White Lillies hang their Heads and soon decay  And whiter Snow in Minutes melts away  Such is your blooming Youth and withering so  The time will come it will when you shall know  The Rage of Love your haughty Heart shall burn  In Flames like mine and meet a like return  Obdurate as you are oh hear at least  My dying Prayers and grant my last Request  When first you ope your Doors and passing by  The sad ill Omend Object meets your Eye  Think it not lost a Moment if you stay  The breathless Wretch so made by you survey  Some cruel Pleasure will from thence arise  To view the mighty ravage of your Eyes  I wish but Oh my Wish is vain I fear  The kind Oblation of a falling Tear  Then loose the Knot and take me from the place  And spread your Mantle o'er my grizly Face  Upon my livid Lips bestow a Kiss  O envy not the dead they feel not Bliss  Nor fear your Kisses can restore my Breath  Even you are not more pitiless than Death  Then for my Corps a homely Grave provide  Which Love and me from publick Scorn may hide  Thrice call upon my Name thrice beat your Breast  And hail me thrice to everlasting Rest  Last let my Tomb this sad Inscription bear  A Wretch whom Love has kill'd lies buried here  Oh Passengers  Aminta's  Eye's beware  Thus having said and furious with his Love  He heav'd with more than humane Force to m  e  A weighty Stone the Labour of a Team  And rais'd from thence he reach'd the Neighbouring Beam▪  Around its Bulk a sliding Knot he throws  And fitted to his Neck the fatal Noose  Then spurning backward took a Swing till Death  Crept up and stopt the passage of his Breath  The Bounce burst ope the Door the Scornful Fair  Relentless lookt and saw him beat his quivering Feet in Air  Nor wept his Fate nor cast a pitying Eye  Nor took him down but brusht regardless by  And as she pass'd her Chance or Fate was such  Her Garments touch'd the Dead polluted by the touch  Next to the Dance thence to the Bath did move  The Bath was sacred to the God of Love  Whose injur'd Image with a wrathful Eye  Stood threat'ning from a Pedestal on high  Nodding a while and watching of his Blow  He fell and falling crush'd th' ungrateful Nymph below  Her gushing Blood the Pavement all besmear'd  And this her last expiring Voice was heard  Lovers farewel Revenge has reach'd my Scorn  Thus warn'd be wise and Love for Love return  THE Despairing Shepherd  ALEXIS  shun'd his Fellow Swains  Their rural Sports and jocund Strains  Heav'n guard us all from  Cupid  's Bow  He lost his Crook he left his Flocks  And wand'ring thro' the lonely Rocks  He nourish'd endless Woe  The Nymphs and Shepherds round him came  His Grief some pity others blame  The fatal Cause all kindly seek  He mingled his Concern with theirs  He gave 'em back their friendly Tears  He sigh'd but wou'd not speak  Clorinda  came among the rest  And she too kind Concern exprest  And ask'd the Reason of his Woe  She ask'd but with an Air and Mein  That made it easily foreseen  She fear'd too much to know  The Shepherd rais'd his mournful Head  And will You pardon me he said  Wh  e I the cruel Truth reveal  Which nothing from my Breast shou'd tear  Which never shou'd offend your Ear  But that You bid me tell  'Tis thus I rove 'tis thus complain  Since You appear'd upon the Plain  You are the Cause of all my Care  Your Eyes ten thousand Dangers dart  Ten thousand Torments vex my Heart  I love and I despair  Too much  Alexis  I have heard  'Tis what I thought 'tis what I fear'd  And yet I pardon you she cry'd  But you shall promise ne'er again  To breath your Vows or speak your Pain  He bow'd obey'd and dy'd  FINIS  USICA INCANTANS SIVE POEMA EXPRIMENS Musicae Vires Juvenem in Insaniam adigentis ET MƲSICI inde PERICƲLƲM  thore ROBERTO SOUTH Art Bac nunc S T P

Moderation DISPLAY'D A POEM  Ne{que} tempore in ullo  Esse queat duplici naturâ corpore bino  Ex alienigenis membris compacta potestas  Lucret lib  By the Author of  Faction Display'd    LONDON  nted and Sold by  H Hills  in  Blackfryars  near the Waterside  PREFACE  AT a Time when we are Celebrating the Successes of our Arms Abro  and the Wisdom of our Councils at Home when there seems to b  no room left for Complaints and the Nation is only prepared to receiv  Panegyrick I am sensible a Piece of this kind will be severely Censur'  For those that are taken up with the present appearances of Thing  who are by much the greatest part of the World will be apt to say is Ʋnseasonable at least if not False and Malicious But I hope othe  who are not content with such superficial Views and to such only wou'd write will see the Reason and Truth of what I have said an  own that it could not be more Seasonably Ʋtter'd than at this  Juncture when we are lull'd with too much Security and by th  means may give Opportunity to a  New Sett of Men  to Ruin bo  Church and State with their  New  Politicks But if this Poem ca  out with all the Advantages imaginable I am not yet grown so Erra  an Author as to think because the  First Part  met with a favourab  Reception that I am now therefore Privileg'd to Dictate to the Re  der's Judgment and to ascribe to my own Merit what was only  ing to his Candour or perhaps Partiality Be that the Business  DEDICATING POETS  I have no Ambition of gai  ing the Reputation of one 'Tis the last Thing I should desire  My Aim is of another sort and I am abundantly Rewarded if have been able to Contribute any thing to the Publick Service by D  tecting the Principles and Practices of this  New Party  who ha  Assum'd to themselves a very Specious Name and Character and wou  be thought the only Patriots of their Country But False Friends a  the most Dangerous Enemies and they are yet much more so wh  they are Invested with Power and the Ministration of Affairs who put into their Hands  'Tis to be wish'd there were no Occasion for Invectives of this kin  that Great Men did always Execute their Trusts and perform the Duty and were only the Objects of our Esteem and Admiration B  when the Case is quite otherwise when they become Treacherous a  Betray the Authority Delegated to them 'tis fit they shou'd hear their Faults and the People be undeceiv'd who are grosly impo  upon by the servile Flatteries of  Hireling Scriblers  A Genera  f Animals that always Infest the Doors of Men in Power and  ho' one wou'd think their Trash could never pass upon the  Moderate  the Grave and the Wife yet they are sometimes thought worthy of Pensions and Places of    l a Year  It is indeed the just Prerogative of the Throne to be approach'd with Humility and Petitions even where the Subjects have Grievances to Represent But I know of no such Homage due to its Officers Nor can I yet be convinced that it is an Arrogant Presumption in private Persons as some wou'd have it to examine and censure the Actions of Publick Ministers who say they being nearest the Helm are consequently best able to judge of what ought and ought not to be done whereas Men in a Remote Sphere and at a distance cannot possibly  nter into the Councils of State and must therefore determine rashly and without knowledge This is a Doctrine necessary to be Preach'd  p in Despotick and Arbitrary Governments where all is Transacted in the Cabinet where the Will and Choice of the Prince gives a Sanction to his Creatures and cannot be controverted without Treason But in a mixt and limited Monarchy where the deepest Resorts of Policy and Turns of Government are in some measure known to Men  f Rank and Condition and where a right of Impeachment is lodged in the House of Commons it can never be maintained for that it  rou'd destroy the Constitution and render the Accusation of Great Officers tho' never so Guilty Impracticable But I would not here be suppos'd to countenance that Scandalous Principle  of Appealing to the Mob  I leave such Maxims to the  Relations  and  Friends  of a  certain Lawyer  who at the  Observator's  Tryal had the  Impudence  as the  AttorneyGeneral  very justly called it to insinuate that  the Crown was in the Disposal of the People  Nor wou'd I be thought in the least to detract from the Prerogative which no Man living has in higher Veneration than my self For I think it never violated but by a profligate abandon'd Nation and I wish for the Honour of the  English  Name our Annals had Recorded no Instances of that kind  But after all this  NewModeration Policy  is not more pernicious and tending to the Destruction of the Government than it is Absur'd and Ridiculous in it self For how can Men of Ʋnderstanding pretend to look Two Ways at once to blow Hot and Cold and fancy that every Body does not see thro' the pitiful Disguise and Artifice They call themselves True Sons of the Church and yet make no scruple of opposing a  Bill  which is absolutely necessary for its Preservation because forsooth it is offered at an unseasonable time as if it was not as seasonable to make wholesom Laws as to engage in a just and  Honourable War for the Security of our Constitution Can they hope for a better Opportunity than the Reign we now enjoy They would be thought great Favourers of the  Church Party  when upon all Occasions they take care to Discountenance them and Encourage only the  Profest Enemies  of Church and State under a shallow Pretence that they are a numerous and formidable Body of Men and ought therefore to be preferr'd to Places of Honour and Profit that they may not grow Mutinous and complain of  Persecution  which methinks should rather be a strong Argument for using all possible Means to suppress such Turbulent Aspiring Spirits Nay so Tender are they of their  DISSENTING BRETHREN  that I am told it has lately been deliver'd as Law by a  Great Man  in  WrHall that a Notorious Perjur'd Vagabond with Two Wives at once be+ing possess'd of a Separate Congregation tho' without any Licence or Legal Qualification to Preach to them shall for that Reason only be exempt from the late Act for listing Vagrants  I must confess I cannot imagine how they would define it or what  Moderation  according to these Practices is The  Logicians  have stated no  Medium  that I know of between Truth and Falshood nor the  Moralists  any between Virtue and Vice Every Proposition and Principle must necessarily fall under one of these Heads  There is no need of a Prophetick Spirit to foresee That they will render themselves Odious and cannot Subsist long I heartily Pity some young Gentlemen who are unwarily drawn in for they will fi  themselves Deceiv'd by their  Crafty Leader  and cannot expect to be receiv'd by their old Friends again 'Tis much to be Lamented that a late  Great Character  Stain'd the latter part of his Life but  De Mortuis nil nisi bonum  I hope some Paragraphs in the close of his Poem will at least prove that I have not writ with Partiality but have equally commende  Merit whereever I found it without any regard to a Party  Moderation DISPLAY'D  AGain my MuseNor fear the steepy Flight  Pursue the Fury thro' the Realms of Night  Explore the Depth of Hell the secret Cause  Whence the New Scheme of  Moderation  rose  Now  Faction  reassum'd her Native Throne  Which prostrate Fiends with awful Homage own  A Crown of Eating Flame her Temples bound  Darting a Blew Malignant Radiance round  An Iron Scepter in her Hand she bore  Emblem of Vengeance and Destructive Pow'r  A bloody Canopy hung o're her Head  Where the  Four  falling  Empires  are pourtray'd  Monarchs Depos'd beneath her footstool lie  And all around is Hell and Anarchy  Whilst thus she tow'ring sat the Subject Train  With Shouts proclaim'd the Triumphs of her Reign  Then they the Chaos sung and Nature's Jars  How the first Atoms urg'd their  Medley  Wars  How Civil Discord and Intestine Rage  Have boil'd in ev'ry Nation ev'ry Age  They sung Divided  Albion  's hapless State  Her Clashing Senate's Feuds her lab'ring Church's Fate  And as her coming Ruin they exprest  A sullen Rapture swell'd in ev'ry Breast  For such the Bent of their Distorted Will  Only to know Delight in Thoughts of ill  But on a sudden Lo descending flew  A Meagre Ghost which soon the Fury knew  Cethego  newly Dead her Darling Pride  Whose Firm Unwav'ring Faith she long had try'd  Long in her Secret Councils had retain'd  By which her Empire o're our Isle she gain'd  No sooner was arriv'd the Welcome Guest  But him in soothing Terms she thus addrest  Hail best Belov'd of all my Sons Receive  What Praise what Joy these Gloomy Realms can give  For 'tis to thy Successful Arts I owe  My Reign Above my Triumph here below  This said th' Unbodied Shade obsequious kneel'd  Struck with Amazement and with Rapture fill'd  O Mighty Queen permit me to Adore  Thy Awful Shrine thy all Informing Pow'r  Whose nearer Influence my Breast Inspires  With Glorious Rage and Mischievous Desires  'Twas in Thy Cause I sunk a mouldring Frame  Unequal to the Hardy Task of Fame  But still my Mind releas'd from Mortal pains  Her innate Faculty of Ill retains  More he had said but the surrounding Throng  Impatient of delay pursu'd their Noisy Song  Mean time the Fiend revolving in her Thought  The mighty Change  Cethego's  Death had wrought  Resolv'd at length to Summon to her Aid  Each plotting Devil each Seditious Shade  She gave the Signal and a Dreadful Sound  Ran Bellowing thro' all th' Abyss profound  Then thus she eas'd her anxious Soul  O dearest Friends O faithful Ministers  Ye mutual Partners of my Joys and Cares  New Ways new Means my restless Thoughts imploy  How  Albion  to reduce her Peace destroy  Long have I labour'd but alas in vain  For now Succeeds the Heav'nly  Anna's  Reign  Who watchful Guards a Stubborn People's Good  By Fears not stagger'd nor by Force subdu'd  Such are the Gifts of her Capacious Mind  Where Justice Mercy Piety are joyn'd  As Motion Light and Heat combin'd in one  Make up the Glorious Essence of the Sun  But still she Mortal is nor will I cease  Till my Revenge be Crown'd with wish'd Success  First then suppose we shou'd devest the Throne  Of Friends whose Souls are kindred to her own  Celsus  Disgrac'd  Hortensio  next appears  Whose Vigilance still Baffles all my Cares  To whom by Right of Ancestry belong  A Loyal Heart and a perswasive Tongue  Now Plots are form'd and publick Tempests rowl  He boasts a strong unshaken Strength of Soul  Fearless against her Foes the Church sustains  Alike their Friendship and their Hate disdains  Disdains their Clamour and Seditious Noise  Secure in the Applauding Senate's Voice  Of Noble Stem in whose  Collat'ral  Lines  Virtue with equal Force and Lustre shines  when  Suada  pleads Success attends the Cause  Suada  the Glory of the  British  Laws  Not the Fam'd Orators of Old were heard  With more attentive Awe more deep Regard  When Thronging round them their Charm'd Audience hung  On the attracting Musick of their Tongue  Nor Hell to  Laelio  can her Praise refuse  Whose Worth deserves his own recording Muse  Who in  Sophia's  Court with just Applause  Maintain'd his Sov'raign Rights his Country's Cause  For 'tis in him with Anguish that I find  All the Endowments of a Gen'rous Mind  Whate're is Great and Brave whate're Refin'd  For 'tis in him Fame doubly does Commend  An Active Patriot and a Faithful Friend  Then from his near Attendance be remov'd  Urbano  tho' by All Admir'd

Vertue ev'ry Grace  Senato  too who Bravely does deride  Sempronia  's little Arts and Female Pride  Whose Lofty Look and whose Majestick Mein  Confess the towring Godlike Soul within  A Speaker of unparallel'd Renown  Long in the Senate long in Council known  Ally'd to  Celsus  by the Noblest Claim  By the same Principles by Worth the same  Old as he is still Firm his Heart remains  And dauntless his declining Frame sustains  So pois'd on its own Base the  Center  bears  The Nodding Fabrick of the Universe  Be these and such as these discharg'd from Court▪  The  Better Genii  that the Crown support  Then in their stead let  Mod'rate  Statesmen reign  Practice their new pretended Golden Mean  A Notion undefin'd in Virtue's Schools  Unrecommended by her sacred Rules  A Modern Coward Principle design'd  To stifle Justice and unnerve the Mind  A Trick by Knaves contriv'd impos'd on Fools  But Scorn'd by Patriot and Exalted Souls  For  Mod'rate  Statesmen like  Camelions  wear  A diff'rent Form in ev'ry diff'rent Air  hey stick at nothing to Secure their Ends  aress their Enemies betray their Friends  Their Medley Temper their Amphibious Mind  fraught with Principles of ev'ry kind  Nor ever can from Stain and Error free  Assert its Native Truth and Energy  As the four Elements so blended were  n their first Chaos so united there  That since they ne're could fully be disjoyn'd  Each retains something of each other's Kind  Nor this is wholly Air nor that pure Flame  But still in both some Atoms are the same  Let  Jano  second of his Trimming Band  Next to  Volpone  deck'd with Honours stand  Like him for secret Policy Renown'd  Like him with all the Gifts of Cunning crown'd  None better can the Jarring Senate guide  Or lure the  Flying Camp  to either side  Of an invet'rate old Fanatick Race  Or Canting Parents sprung this Child of Grace  In Show a  Tory  but a  Whig  in Heart  For Saints may safely act the Sinner's part  Once he was ours and will be ours again  For Art to stifle Nature strives in vain  For ev'ry thing when from its  Center  born  Still thither tends still thither will return  Let him with these Accomplishments supply  Hortensio's  steddy Faith and Loyalty  B  u  bus  for he has Wealth to buy a Place  Shall wear  Urbano  's Key his Post disgrace  A worthy Son in whom collected shine  The Follies of his Mad and Ideot Line  Lord of the woful Countenance whose Skin  Seems fear'd without and putrify'd within  A Dapper Animal whose Pigmy Size  Provokes the Ladies Scorn and mocks their Eyes  But Balls and Musick are his greatest Care  So willing is the Wretch to please the Fair  'Tis strange that Men what Nature has deny'd  Should make their only Aim their only Pride  Let  Britono  who from the Parent Moon  Derives his  Welsh  Descent directly down  Succeed  Senato  in his High Command  And bear the Staff of Honour in his Hand  A flutt'ring empty Fop that ev'ry Night  Sits Laughing loud and Jesting in the Pit  Whilst a surrounding Croud of Whores and Bawds  His sprightly Converse and his Wit applauds  An Atlas proper to sustain the Weight  Of an Incumber'd and declining State  Let these as Useful Tools a while possess  The Court Preferments and Indulge their Ease  But they shall fly like Mists before the Sun  When my Designs to full Perfection grown  Exert their Pow'r and make the ruin'd World my own  When thus the Fury had her Scheme display'd  Assenting Hell a low Obeisance paid  Moloch  Protector of the  Papal Chair    Author of the Massacres and Christian War  Was now Convinc'd that Sanguinary Laws  Could nere the  Reformation  's Growth oppose  Could nere in  Albion  's Church advance his Cause  He therefore urg'd with his old constant Hate  By  Mod'rate  Means consents to work her Fate  He finds how soon by  Toleration  's Aid  Her Pow'r is weaken'd and her Rights Betray'd  Nor doubts  Occasional Conformity  Will by degrees her Essence quite destroy  Then  Satan  Prince of the  Fanatick  Train  Who form'd the Conduct of their  Glorious  Reign  Approve the Scheme not hoping to Restore  His Subjects to their late unbounded Pow'r  or well he knew their Avarice and Pride  ad wean'd the Bankrupt Nation from their side  ut these Auspicious  Moderation  Times  y not Detecting Sanctify their Crimes  y Baffling Justice and eluding Law  Make Vice insult and Sin Triumphant grow  Nay such th' Effects of  Moderation  are  The Guilty to Reward as well as Spare  Hence Foes to Prelacy are Clad in Lawn  Hence Rebels are the Fav'rites of the Throne  What could they more desire than thus to pass  The blest Remainder of their happy Days  atted with Plunder and dissolv'd in Ease  Nor  Belial  th'  Atheist  's Patron could Complain  or  Moderation  would enlarge his Reign

THE PREFACE  THE Favourers of the  Hind  and  Panther  will be apt to say in its Defence That the best things are  apable of being turn'd to Ridicule that  omer  has been Burlesque'd and  Virgil  ravested without suffering any thing in  heir Reputation from that Buffoonry and  hat in like manner the  Hind  and the  Pan  er  may be an exact Poem tho' 'tis the Sub  ect of our Raillery But there is this diffe  ence that those Authors are wrested from  heir true Sense and this naturally falls in  Ridicule there is nothing Represented  ere as monstrous and unnatural which is  ot equally so in the Original First as to  he General Design Is it not as easie to ima  ine two  Mice  bilking Coachmen and sup  ing at the  Devil  as to suppose a  Hind  tertaining the  Panther  at a  Hermit  's  Cell  iscussing the greatest Mysteries of Religion  d telling you her Son  Rodriguez  writ very  od Spanish What can be more improbable  and contradictory to the Rules and Example  of all Fables and to the very Design an  Ʋse of them They were first begun and raised to the highest Perfection in the  Easter  Countries where they wrote in Signs an  spoke in Parables and delivered the mos  useful Precepts in delightful Stories whic  for their Aptness were entertaining to th  most Judicious and led the vulgar into Ʋnderstanding by surprizing them with thei  Novelty and fixing their Attention A  their Fables carry a double meaning th  Story is one and intire the Characters th  same throughout not broken or chang'd and always conformable to the Nature of th  Creatures they introduce They never te  you that the Dog which snapt at a Shadow lost his Troop of Horse that would be unintelligible a piece of Flesh is proper for hi  to drop and the Reader will apply it t  Mankind they would not say that the Da  who was so proud of her borrow'd Plume  lookt very ridiculous when  Rodriguez  cam  and took away all the Book but th  th th  and  th  Chapters which sh  stole from him But this is his new way o  telling a Story and confounding the  Mora  and the  Fable  together  Before the Word was written said th  Hind  Our Saviour Preach'd the Faith to a  Mankind  What relation has the  Hind  to our Saviour or what Notion have we of a  Pan  her  's Bible If you say he means the Church how does the Church feed on Lawns or range in the Forest Let it be always a Church or always the clovenfooted Beast  or we cannot bear his shifting the Scene every Line If it is absurd in Comedies to  ake a Peasant talk in the Strain of a  Hero  r a Country Wench use the Language of the Court how monstrous is it to make a Priest  f a Hind and a Parson of a Panther To bring 'em in disputing with all the For  alities and Terms of the School Though  s to the Arguments themselves those we  onfess are suited to the Capacity of the Beasts and if we would suppose a Hind ex  ressing her self about these Matters she  ould talk at that Rate  As to the Absurdity of his Expressions  here is nothing wrested to make 'em ridiculous the Terms are sometimes alter'd to make the Blunder more visible  Knowldge misunderstood  is not at all better Sense  han  Understanding misunderstood  though tis confest the Author can play with words  o well that this and twenty such will pass off  t a slight reading  There are other Mistakes which could not  e brought in for they were too gross for  Bayes  himself to commit 'Tis hard to conceive how any Man could censure the  Turk  for Gluttony a People that debauch in Coffee are voluptuous in a Mess of Rice and keep the strictest  Lent  without the Pleasures of a  Carnival  to encourage them But 'tis almost impossible to think that any Man wh  had not renounced his Senses should rea  Duncomb  for  Allen  He had been told that Mr  Allen  had written a Discourse o  Humility  Difference betwixt a Protestant and  Socinian  p  to which he wisely answers Tha  that magnified Piece of  Duncomb  's was Translated from the  Spanish  of  Rodriguez  and to set it beyond dispute makes the infallible Guide affirm the same thing There are few Mistakes  Pag  but one may imagine how a Ma  fell into them and at least what he aim'd at but what likeness is there betwee  Duncomb  and  Allen  do they so much as Rhime  We may have this Comfort under the Severity of his Satyr to see his Abilities equally lessen'd with his Opinion of us and that he could not be a fit Champion against the  Panther  till he had laid aside all his Judgment But we must applaud his Obedience to his new Mother  Hind  she  Disciplin'd  him severely  Pag  she commanded him it seems to  Sacrifice  his  Darling Fame  and to do it effectually he publisht this learned Piece This is the favourable Construction we would put on his Faults tho' he takes  care to inform us  Pref  that it was done from no Imposition but out of a natural Propensity he has to Malice and a particular Inclination of doing Mischief What else could provoke him to  Libel the Court  Blaspheme  Kings  abuse the whole  Scotch Nation  Pag  rail at the greatest Part of his own and lay all the Indignities imaginable on the only establish'd Religion And we must now Congratulate him this Felicity that there is no Sect or Denomination of Christians whom he has not abused  Thus far his Arms have with Success been crown'd  Let  Turks Jews  and  Infidels  look to themselves he has already begun the War upon them When once a Conqueror grows thus dreadful 'tis the Interest of all his Neighbours to oppose him for there is no Alliance to be made with one that will face about and destroy his Friends and like a second  Almanzor  change Sides meerly to keep his hand in ure This Heroick Temper of his has created him some Enemies that did by no means affect Hostility and he may observe this Candor in the Management that none of his Works are concern'd in these Papers but his last Piece and I believe he is sensible this is a Favour I was not ambitious of Laughing at any Perswasion or making Religion the Subject of  such a Trifle so that no Man is here con+cern'd but the Author himself and nothing ridicul'd but his way of arguing  But Gentlemen if you won't take it s  you must grant my Excuse is

know the Deceit of  hat Word well enough  Pref ib  Let me have the  Marks  f you  Conscience  before I trust it for if it be not  of the same Stamp with mine Gad I may b  knock'd down  for all your fair Promises  Smith  Nay prithee  Bayes  what damn'd Vil+lainy hast thou been about that thou'rt under thes  Apprehensions Upon my Honour I'm thy Friend yet thou lookest as sneaking and frighted as a Do  that has been worrying Sheep  Bayes  Pref ib  Ay Sir  The Nation is in too high a Fe  +ment for me to expect any Mercy  or I'gad to tru  any Body  Smith  But why this to us my Old Friend wh  you know never trouble our Heads with Nationa  Concerns till the third Botlle has taught us as muc  of Politicks as the next does of Religion  Bayes  Ah Gentlemen leave this Prophanenes  I am alter'd since you saw me and cannot be  this loose Talk now Mr  Johnson  you are  Man of Parts let me desire you to read  the Gui  of Controversy  and Mr  Smith  I would recom+mend to you  the Considerations on the Council  Trent  Page  and so Gentlemen your humble Servant  Good Life be now my Task  Johns  Nay Faith we won't part so Belie  us we are both your Friends let us step to th  Rose  for one quarter of an Hour and talk ov  old Stories  Bayes  I ever took you to be Men of Honou  and for your sakes I will transgress as far as o  Pint  Johns  Well Mr  Bayes  many a merry Bo  have we had in this House and shall have again hope Come what Wine are you for  Bayes  Gentlemen do you as you please for  part he shall bring me a single Pint of any thing  Smith  How so Mr  Bayes  have you lost yo  Pallat you have been more curious  Bayes  True I have so but  Senses  must  starv'd    Page  that the  Soul  may be  gratified  Men  our Kidney make the  Senses  the  supream Judge    nd therefore bribe 'em high but we have laid  o  h the Use and Pleasure of 'em aside  Smith  What is not there good Eating and Drinking on both sides You make the Separation  reater than I thought it  Bayes  No no whenever you see a Fat Rosie  olour'd Fellow take it from me  Ibid  he is either a  rotestant or a  Turk    Johns  At that rate Mr  Bayes  one might sus  ect your Conversion methinks thou hast as much  e Face of an  Heretick  as ever I saw  Bayes  Such was I such by Nature still I am  Pag  ut I hope e'er long I shall have drawn this  pam  er'd Paunch  fitter for the  straight Gate    Smith  Sure Sir you are in ill hands your Confessor gives you more severe Rules than he  ractices for not long ago a  Fat Friar  was  ought a  true Character    Bayes  Things were misrepresented to me I  onfess I have been unfortunate in some of my Writings But since you have put me upon that  ubject I'll show you a thing I have in my Pock  shall wipe off all that or I am mistaken  Smith  Come now thou art like thy self again  ere's the  King  's Health to theeCommunicate  Bayes  Well Gentlemen here it is and I'll be  old to say the exactest Piece the World ever saw  Non Pareillo  I'faith But I must bespeak your  ardons if it reflects any thing upon your Perswa  on  Johns  Use your Liberty Sir you know we are  o  Bigots    Bayes  Why then you shall see me lay the  Refor  ation  on its Back I'gad and justifie our Religion  y way of  Fable    Johns  An apt Contrivance indeed What do  ou make a  Fable  of your  Religion  Bayes  Ay I'gad and without  Morals  too so  I tread in no Man's Steps and to show you how far I can outdo any thing that ever was writ in thi  kind I have taken  Horace  's Design but I'gad have so outdone him you shall be asham'd fo  your  Old Friend  You remember in him the  Story  of the  CountryMouse  and the  CityMouse  wha  a plain simple thing it is it has no more Life an  Spi  it in it I'gad than a Hobbyhorse and hi  Mice  talk so meanly such common stuff so lik  meer Mice  that I wonder it has pleas'd the Worl  so long But now will I undeceive  Mankind  and teach 'em to  heighten  and  elevate a Fable  I'l  bring you in the very same  Mice  disputing th  Depth of  Philosophy  searching into the Fundamen+tals of  Religion  quoting  Texts Fathers Councils  and all that I 'gad as you shall see either of 'e  could easily make an Ass of a  Country Vicar  Now whereas  Horace  keeps to the dry naked History  have more Copiousness than to do that I'gad Here I draw you general  Characters  and describ  all the  Beasts  of the  Creation  there I lanch ou  into long  Digressions  and leave my  Mice  for twenty Pages together then I fall into  Raptures  and make the finest  Soliloquies  as would ravish you Won't this do think you  Johns  Faith Sir I don't well conceive you all this about two  Mice    Bayes  Ay why not Is it not great and Heroi+cal But come you'll understand it better whe  you hear it and pray be as severe as you can I'ga  I defie all  Criticks  Thus it begins  Pag  A Milkwhite  Mouse  immortal and unchang'd  Fed on soft Cheese and o'er the  Dairy  rang'd  Without unspotted innocent within  She fear'd no danger for she knew no  Gin    Johns  Methinks Mr  Bayes  soft Cheese is a little too coarse Diet for an  immortal Mouse  were there any necessity for her eating you should have consulted  Homer  for some  Coelestial Provision    Bayes  Faith Gentlemen I did so but indeed I have not the  Latin  one which I have mark'd by me and could not readily find it in the Original  Yet had She oft been  scar'd by bloody Claws  Pag  O  winged  Owls and stern  Grimalkins  Paws  Aim'd at her  destin'd Head which made her  fly    Pag  Tho' She was  doom'd to Death  and  fated not to dye    Smith  How came She that  fear'd no Danger  in the Line before to be scar'd in this Mr  Bayes    Bayes  Why then you may have it  chas'd  if you will for I hope a Man may run away without being  afraid  mayn't he  Johns  But pray give me leave how was She  doom'd to Death  if She was  fated not to die  are not  Doom  and  Fate  much the same thing  Bayes  Nay  Gentlemen  if you question my Skill  n the Language I'm your humble Servant the  Rogues  the  Criticks  that will allow me nothing else give me that sure I that made the Word  now best what I meant by it I assure you  doom'd  nd  fated  are quite different things  Smith  Faith Mr  Bayes  if you were  doom'd  to  e hang'd whatever you were  fated  to 'twould  ive you but small Comfort  Bayes  Never trouble your Head with that Mr  Smith  mind the Business in hand  Not so her young their  Linsywoolsy  Line  Pag    Was Hero's make half humane half Divine  Smith  Certainly these  Hero's half Humane half Divine  have very little of the  Mouse  their  Mother    Bayes  Gadsokers Mr  Johnson  does your  riend think I mean nothing but a  Mouse  by all  this I tell thee Man I mean a  Church  and these young Gentlemen her Sons signifie  Priests Martyrs  and  Confessors  that were hang'd in  Oats  's  Plot  There's an excellent  Latin  Sentence which I had a mind to bring in  Sanguis Martyrum semen Ecclesiae  and I think I have not wrong'd it in the Translation  Of these a slaughter'd Army lay in Blood  Pag  Whose sanguine Seed encreas'd the sacred  Brood  She multiply'd  by these  now rang'd alone  Pag  And wander'd in the Kingdoms once her own  Smith  Was She  alone  when  the sacred Brood wa  encreased    Bayes  Why thy Head's running on the  Mous  again but I hope a  Church  may be  alone  tho  the  Members  be  encreased  mayn't it  Johns  Certainly Mr  Bayes  a  Church  which i  a  diffusive Body of Men  can much less be said to be  alone    Bayes  But are you really of that Opinion Take it from me Mr  Johnson  you are wrong however to oblige you I'll clap in some  Simile  or other about the  Children of Israel  and it shall do  Smith  Will you pardon me one Word more Mr  Bayes  What could the  Mouse  for I suppose you mean her now do more than  range  in the  Kingdoms  when they were her own  Bayes  Do Why She  reign'd  had a  Diadem Scepter  and  Ball  till they depos'd her  Smith  Now her Sons are so  encreas'd  She may try t'other pull for't  Bayes  I'gad and so She may before I have don  with Her it has cost me some pains to clear He  Title Well but Mum for that Mr  Smith  The  Common Hunt  She timorously past by  Pag  For they made tame  disdain'd Her Company    They grin'd  She in a Fright  tript  o'er the Green  For  She was  lov'd  whereever She was  seen    Johns  Well said little  Bayes  I'faith the Critick must have a great deal of leisure that attacks those Verses  Bayes  I'gad I'll warrant him whoe'er he i    ffendet solido  but I go on  The Independent Beast  Pag    Smith  Who is that Mr  Bayes  Bayes  Why a Bear Pox is not that obvious enough  In Groans Her hate exprest  Which I'gad is very natural to that  Animal  Well there's for the  Independent  Now the  Quaker  what do you think I call him  Smith  Why A  Bull  for ought I know  Bayes  A  Bull  O Lord A Bull No no a  Hare  a  quaking HareArmarillis  because She wears  Armour  'tis the same Figure and I am  roud to say it Mr  Johnson  no Man knows how  o  pun  in  Heroics  but my self Well you shall  ear  She thought and reason good the  quaking Hare  Her cruel Foe because  She would not swear    Pag  And had  profess'd Neutrality    Johns  A shrewd Reason that Mr  Bayes  but what Wars were there  Bayes  Wars why there had been bloody Wars  ho' they were pretty well reconcil'd now Yet to  ing in two or three such fine things as these I  o'nt tell you the Lyon's Peace was proclaim'd till  fty Pages after tho' 'twas really done before I  ad finish'd my Poem  Next Her the Buffoon Ape  his Body  bent  Pag  And paid at Church a Courtier's Complement  That Gauls somewhere I'gad I can't leave▪ off tho' I were cudgel'd every Day for it  Pag  The brisl'd  Baptist  Boar impure as he    Smith  As who  Bayes  As the  Courtier  let 'em e'en take it a  they will I'gad I seldom come amongst 'em  Pag  Was whiten'd with the Foam of Sanctity  The Wolf with Bellygaunt his rough Crest rears  And pricks up  Now in one Word will abuse the whole Party most damnably  an  pricks up  I'gad I am sure you'll laugh  his predestinating Ears  Prethee Mr  Johnso  remember little  Bayes  when next you see a  Presby+terian  and take notice if he has not  Predestinatio  in the Shape of his  Ear  I have studied Men  long I'll undertake to know an  Arminian    the setting of his Wig  His predestinating Ears  I'gad there's ne'er  Presbyterian  shall dare to show his Head without Border I'll put 'em to that Expence  Smith  Pray Mr  Bayes  if any of 'em shou  come over to the  Royal Party  would their E  alter  Bayes  Would they Ay I'gad they would sh  their  Fanatical Lugs  and have just such we  turn'd  Ears  as I have mind this  Ear  this is a tr  Roman Ear  mine are much chang'd for the bett  within this two Years  Smith  Then if ever the Party should chance fail you might lose 'em  for what may change m  fall  Bayes  Mind mind  Pag  These fiery  Zuinglius  meagre  Calvin  bred  Smith  Those I suppose are some OutLan  +ish Beasts Mr  Bayes    Bayes  Beasts a good Mistake Why they w  the chief  Reformers  but here I put 'em in so b  Company because they were Enemies to my  Mo  and anon when I am warm'd I'gad you shall hear me call 'em  Doctors Captains  Pag  Horses  and  Horsemen  in the very same Breath You shall hear how I go on now  Or else reforming  Corah  spawn'd  this Class    When opening Earth made way for all to pass  Pag  Johns  For  all  Mr  Bayes    Bayes  Yes They were  all  lost there but some of 'em wre thrown up again at the  LemanLake  As a Catholick  Queen  sunk at  CharingCross  and  ose again at  Queenhithe    The Fox and he came shuffled in the dark  Pag  If ever they were stow'd in  Noah  's Ark  Here I put a Quaere Whether there were any  So  inians  before the  Flood  which I'm not very well satisfied in I have been lately apt to believe that  he World was drown'd for that  Heresy  which  mong Friends made me leave it  Quickned with Fire below these Monsters breed  In Fenny  Holland  and in Fruitful  Tweed    Pag  Now to write something new and out of the way  o elevate and surprize and all that I fetch you see this  Quickning Fire  from the Bottom of  Bogs  and  Rivers    Johns  Why Faith that's as ingenious a Con  rivance as the  Virtuoso  's making a BurningGlass  f Ice  Bayes  Why was there ever any such thing Let  e perish if ever I heard of it The Fancy was  eer new to me and I thought no Man had re  oncil'd those Elements but my self Well Gen  lemen Thus far I have followed Antiquity and  s  Homer  has numbred his Ships so I have rang'd  y Beasts Here is my  Boar  and my  Bear  and  y  Fox  and my  Wolf  and the rest of 'em all  against my poor  Mouse  Now what do you think I do with all these  Smith  Faith I don't know I suppose you make 'em fight  Bayes  Fight I'gad I'd as soon make 'em Dance No I do no earthly thing with 'em nothing at all I'gad I think they have play'd their Parts sufficiently already I have walk'd 'em out show'd 'em to the Company and rais'd your Expectation And now whilst you hope to see 'em bated and are dreaming of Blood and Battels they sculk off and you hear no more of 'em  Smith  Why Faith Mr  Bayes  now you have been at such Expence in setting forth their Characters it had been too much to have gone through with 'em  Bayes  I'gad so it had And then I'll tell you another thing 'tis not every one that reads a Poem through And therefore I fill the first part with Flowers Figures fine Language and all that and then I'gad sink by degrees till at last I write but little better than other People And wherea  most Authors  creep servilely  after the Old Fellows and strive to grow upon their Readers I take another Course I bring in all my Characters together and let 'em see I could go on with 'em bu  I'gad I won't  Johns  Could go on with 'em Mr  Bayes  there'  no Body doubts that You have a most particula  Genius  that way  Bayes  Oh Dear Sir You are mighty oblig+ing But I must needs say at a  Fable  or an  Emble  I think no Man comes near me indeed I have stu+died it more than any Man Did you ever tak  notice Mr  Johnson  of a little thing that has ta+ken mightily about Town a  Cat with a Topknot  Johns  Faith Sir 'tis mighty pretty I saw  at the CoffeeHouse  Bayes  'Tis a Trifle hardly worth owning I was t'other Day at  Will  's throwing out something of  hat Nature and I'gad the hint was taken and out came that Picture indeed the poor Fellow was so civil to present me with a dozen of 'em for my Friends I think I have one here in my Pocket would you please to accept it Mr  Johnson  Johns  Really 'tis very ingenious  Bayes  Oh Lord Nothing at all I could design  wenty of 'em in an Hour if I had but witty Fel  ows about me to draw 'em I was proffer'd a Pension to go into  Holland  and contrive their  Emblems  But hang 'em they are dull Rogues and would spoil my Invention But come Gentlemen let us return to our Business and here I'll give you a delicate Description of a Man  Smith  But how does that come in  Bayes  Come in very naturally I was talking of a  Wolf  and that supposes a Wood and then I clap an Epithet to't and call it a  Celtic Wood  Now when I was there I could not help thinking of the  French Persecution  and I'gad from all these Thoughts I took occasion to rail at the  French King  and show that he was not of the same  Make with other Men which thus I prove  The Divine  Blacksmith  in th' Abyss of Light  Pag  Yawning and lolling  with a careless beat    Struck out the mute Creation at a Heat  But he work'd hard to Hammer out our Souls  He blew the Bellows and stir'd up the Coals  Long time he thought and could not on a sudden  Knead up with  unskim'd  Milk  this Reas'ning Pudding  P  ge  Tender and mild within its Bag it lay  Confessing still the softness of its Clay  And kind as MilkMaids on their WeddingDay  Till  Pride of Empire Lust  and hot Desire  Did overboil him like too great a Fire  And understanding grown  misunderstood    Burn'd Him to th' Pot and sour'd his curdle  Blood  Johns  But sure this is a little prophane Mr  Baye  Bayes  Not at all Do's not  Virgil  bring in hi  God Vulcan  working at the  Anvil    Johns  Ay Sir but never thought his Hand the fittest to make a Pudding  Bayes  Why do you imagine Him an Earthly dirty  Blacksmith  'Gad you make it prophane indeed I'll tell you there's as much difference be+twixt 'em I'gad as betwixt my Man and  Milton'  But now Gentlemen the Plot thickens he  comes my t'other Mouse the City Mouse  Page  A  spotted  Mouse the prettiest next the White  Ah were her Spots wash'd out as pretty quite  ag Pag  With  Phylacteries  on her Forehead spread  Crozi  r  in Hand and  Mitre  on her Head  Pag  Three Steeples Argent on her Sable Shield  Liv'd in the  City  and disd  in'd the  Field    Johns  This is a glorious  Mouse  indeed but a  you have dress'd her we don't know whether s  be  J  w Papist  or  Protestant    Bayes  Let me embrace you Mr  Johnson  fo  that▪ you take it right She is a meer  Babel  Religions  and therefore she's a  spotted Mouse  her  and will be a Mule presently But to go on  This Princess  Smith  What  Princess  Mr  Bayes  Bayes  Why this  Mouse  for I forgot to tell yo  an  Old Lyon  made a  Left Hand Marriage  with h  Mother  Pag  and begot  on her Body Elizabeth Schis  who was married to  Timothy Sacriledg  and ha  Issue  Graceless Heresy  Who all give the sa  Coat with their Mother  Three Steeples Argent    I told you before  This Princess tho'  estrang'd  from what was  best    Was least Deform'd because Reform'd the least  Pag  There's  De  and  Re  as good I'gad as ever was  She in a Masquerade of Mirth and Love  Pag  Mistook the Bliss of Heaven for Bacchinals above  And grub'd the  Thorns  beneath our tender Feet  To make the Paths of Paradise more sweet  There's a Jolly Mouse for you let me see any Body  lse that can shew you such another Here now  ave I one damnable severe reflecting Line but I  ant a Rhime to it can you help me Mr Johnson  She  Humbly content to be despis'd at Home  Johns  Which is  too narrow Infamy for some  Bayes  Sir I thank you now I can go on with it  Whose Merits are diffus'd from Pole to Pole  Pag  Where Winds can carry and where Waves can rowl  Johns  But does not this reflect upon some of our Friends Mr  Bayes  Bayes  'Tis no matter for that let me alone to  ring my self off I'll tell you lately I writ a  amn'd Libel on a whole Party sheer Point and  atyr all through I'gad Call'd 'em Rogues Dogs  nd all the Names I could think of but with an  xceeding deal of Wit that I must needs say  ow it happen'd before I could finish this Piece  e Scheme of Affairs was altered and those Peo  le were no longer Beasts Here was a Plunge  ow Should I lose my Labour or Libel my  riend  Tis not every Body's Talent to find a  alvo  for this But what do I but write a smooth  elicate Preface wherein I tell them that  the Satyr  as not intended to them  and this did the Business  Smith  But if it was not intended to them against  hom it was writ certainly it had no meaning  all  Bayes  Poh There's the Trick on't Poor Fool  they took it and were satisfied And yet it maul'  'em damnably I'gad  Smith  Why Faith Mr  Bayes  there's this ver  Contrivance in the  Preface  to  Dear Joys Jests    Bayes  What a Devil do you think that l' steal from such an Author Or ever read it  Smith  I can't tell but you sometimes read a bad I have heard you quote  Reynard the Fox    Bayes  Why there's it now take it from me Mr  Smith  there is as good  Morality  and as soun  Precepts in the  Delectable History of Reynard  Fox  as in any Book I know except  Seneca  Pra  tell me where in any other Author could I hav  found so pretty a Name for a Wolf as  Isgrim  B  prithee Mr  Smith  give me no more trouble an  let me go on with my  Mouse    Pag  One Evening  when she went away from Court  Levee's and Couchee's past without resort  There's Court Language for you nothing gives Verse so fine a turn as an Air of good Breeding  Smith  But methinks the  Levee's and Couchee  of a  Mouse  are too great especially when she walking from Court to the cooler Shades  Bayes  I'gad now have you forgot what I tol  you that she was a  Princess  But pray mind he  the two Mice meet  Pag  She met the Country Mouse whose  fearful Face  Beheld from far the common watering Place  Nor durst approach  Smith  Methinks Mr  Bayes  this Mouse strangely alter'd since she  fear'd no Danger    Bayes  Godsokers Why no more she does n  yet fear either Man or Beast But poor Creatur  she's afraid of the Water for she could not swi  as you see by this  Nor durst approach till with an awful Roar  Pag  The Soveraign Lyon bad her fear no more  ut besides 'tis above thirty Pages off that I told  u she  fear'd no Danger  and I'gad if you will  ve no Variation of the Character you must have  e same thing over and over again 'tis the Beauty  Writing to strike you still with something new Wee but to proceed  But when she had this sweetest Mouse in  view    Pag  Good  Lord how she admir'd her Heavenly Hiew  ere now to show you I am Master of all Stiles I  my self down from the  Majesty  of  Virgil  to the  weetness  of  Ovid    Good  Lord how she admir'd her Heavenly Hiew    What more easie and familiar I writ this Line for  e  Ladies  The little Rogues weill be so fond of  e to find I can yet be so tender I hate such a  ough unhewen Fellow as  Milton  that a Man  ust sweat to read Him I'gad you may run over  is and be almost asleep  Th' Immortal Mouse who saw the  Viceroy  come  So far to see Her did invite her Home  There's a pretty Name now for the  Spotted Mouse    e  Viceroy    Smith  But pray why d'e call her so  Bayes  Why Because it sounds prettily  Pag  I'll  all her the  CrownGeneral  presently if I've a mind  o it Well  did invite her Home  To smoak a Pipe and o'er a sober Pot  Discourse of  Oates  and  Bedloe  and the  Plot    Pag  She made a Court'sy like a Civil Dame  And being  much a Gentlewoman  came  Pag  Well Gentlemen here's my first part finish'd and  think I have kept my Word with you and given  the  Majestick turn of Heroick Poesy  The rest being  matter of Dispute I had not such frequent oc  asion for the Magnificence of Verse  tho' I'gad they  speak very well And I have heard  Men  and  considerable Men  too talk the very same things a great deal worse  Johns  Nay without doubt Mr  Bayes  they have received no small advantage from the smooth+ness of your Numbers  Bayes  Ay ay I can do't if I list though you must not think I have been so dull as to mind thes  things my self but 'tis the advantage of our  Coffee house  that from their Talk one may write a ver  good  Polemical Discourse  without ever troublin  one's Head with the Books of  Controversie  For can take the slightest of their Arguments and cl  'em pertly into four Verses which shall stare an  London Divine  in the Face Indeed your knou  Reasonings with a long Train of  Majors  and  M  +nors  and the Devil and all are too barbarous f  my Stile but I'gad I can flourish better with on  of these twinkling Arguments than the best of 'e  can fight with t'other But we return to our  Mous  and now I've brought 'em together let 'em 'e  speak for themselves which they will do extream+ly well or I'm mistaken And pray observe Gen+tlemen if in one you don't find all the Delicacy  a luxurious CityMouse and in the other all th  plain Simplicity of a sober serious Matron  Dame  Pag  said the Lady of the Spotted Muff  Methinks your Tiff is

to be exported to the decay of Trade at home  With these Allurements  Spotted  did invite  From  Hermits Cell  the  Female Proselyte    Oh with what ease we follow such a Guide  Where Souls are starv'd and Senses gratifi'd  Now would not you think she's going But I'gad you're mistaken you shall hear a long Argument  bout Infallibility before she stirs yet  Page  But here the  White  by  Observation wise  ▪  Who long on Heaven had fixt her  prying  Eyes  With thoughtful Countenance and grave Remark  Said or my Judgment fails me or 'tis dark  Lest therefore we should stray and not go

you Sister this is but a Whim  For still we want a  Guide  to find out Him  Here you see I don't trouble my self to keep on the Narration but write  white Speak  or  dappl  Speaks  by the side But when I get any nobl  Thought which I envy a  Mouse  should say I clap it down in my own Person with a  Po  ta Loquitur    Page ▪  which take notice is a surer sign of a fi  e thing in my Writings than

Although we know not him we cannot stray  That's true I'gad Well said  White  You se  her Adversary has nothing to say for her self and therefore to confirm the Victory she shall make  Simile    Smith

 Philosophers  thence gather  From this Dissention that they work by neither  And I'gad she's in the right on't but mind now she comes upon her swop  All this I did your Arguments to try  And I'gad if

Helps rely  Our Wit must be as true our Thoughts as high  Pag  For as an  Author  happily compares  Tradition  to a wellfixt pair of  Stairs    So this the  Scala Sancta  we believe  By which his

take a little more and here I'll pass over two dainty  Episodes  of  Swal+lows Swifts Chickens  and  Buzzards    Johns  I know not why they should come in except to make yours the longest  Fable  that eve  was told  Bayes  Why the Excellence of a  Fable  is in th  Length of it  Aesop  indeed like a Slave as h  was made little short simple Stories with a dr  Moral at the end of 'em and could not form an  Noble Design But here I give you  Fable  upo  Fable  and after you are satisfied with Beasts i  the first Course serve you up a delicate Dish o  Fowl for the second now I was at all this

have my Revenge on him sufficiently for I let all the World  now that he is a  tall broad back'd lusty Fellow    Pag  of a  Brown Complexion fair Behaviour  a  Fluent  ongue  and  taking  amongst the

will make you  plit I call himI'gad I won't tell you unless remember what I said of him  Smith  Why that he was much a  Scholar  and more a  Wit    Bayes  Right and his Name is  Buzzard  Ha ha ha  Johns  Very proper indeed Sir  Bayes  Nay I have a farther fetch in it yet  han perhaps you imagine for his true Name begins with a  B  which makes me sl  ly contrive him  his to begin with the same Letter There's a  retty Device Mr  Johnson  I learn'd it I must  eeds confess from that ingenious Sport I love my Love with an  A  because she's  Amiable  and  you could but get a Knot of merry

Tradition  better than  Scripture  No  you must know 'tis sincerely my Opinion that  had been better for the World if we ne'er had an  Bibles  at all  E'er that  Gazette  was printed said the  White

all Men by my self 'tis so wi  me I never strove to be very exact in any thi  but I spoil'd it  Smith  But allowing your Character to be tru  is it not a little too severe  Bayes  'Tis no matter for that these gene  Reflections are daring and savour most of a  No  Genius  that spares neither  Friend  nor  Foe    Johns  Are you never afraid of a drubbing for that  daring  of your  Noble Genius    Bayes  Afraid Why  Lord  you make so much of a Beating I'gad 'tis no more to me than a Flea biting No no if I can but be witty upon 'em let 'em 'en lay on I'faith I'll ne'er baulk my Fancy to save my

deserv'd the utmost Praise  For Greatness Birth and Justice fam'd  nd every Virtue cou'd be nam'd  Which made her course of Life so even  hat she's a Saint if dead in Heaven  This Lady had a little Seat  st like a Palace 'twas so neat  om ought but Goodness her Retreat  One Morning in her giving way  s was her Custom ev'ry Day  o cheer the Poor the Sick and Cold  r with Apparel Fookd or Gold  here came a gazing Stranger by  n whom she quickly cast an Eye  The Man admiring made a stand  e had a Bird upon his Hand  What's that says she that hangs it Head  nking and faint 'Tis almost dead  adam a  RedBreast  that I found  this Wet Season almost drown'd  h bring him in and keep him warm  obins  do never any harm  They soon obey'd and chopt him Meat  Gave him whatever he wou'd Eat  The Lady Care her self did take  And made a Nest for  Robin  's sake  But he perkt up into her Chair  In which he plenteously did fare  Assuming quite another Air  The Neighbours thought when this they spy'd  The World well mended on his side  With welltun'd Throat he whistl'd long  And every body lik'd his Song  At last said they this little Thing  Will kill it self so long to sing  Well Closet him among the rest  Of those my Lady loves the best  They little thought that saw him come  That  Robins  were so quarrelsome  The Door they open'd in he pops  And to the highest Perch he hops  The partycolour'd Birds he chose  The  GoldFinches  and such as those  With them he'd Peck and Bill and Feed  And very well at times agreed  Canary  Birds were his Delight  With them he'd Test a Test all Night  But the brown  Linnets  went to pot  He kill'd 'em all upon the spot  The Servants were employ'd each Day  Instead of Work to part some Fray  And wisht the aukard Fellow curst  That brought him to my Lady first  At last they all resolv'd upon't  Some way to tell my Lady on't  Mean while he'd had a noble Swing  And rul'd just like the  Galli  King  Having kill'd or wounded all  Unless the  Eagle  in the Hall  With whom he durst but only Jar▪  He being the very Soul of War  But hated him for his Desert  And bore him Malice at his Heart  This  Eagle  was my Lady's Pride  The Guardian Safety of her Side  He often brought home Foreign Prey  Which humbly at her Feet he lay  For Colour Pinions and Stature  The fairest Workmanship of Nature  Twou'd do one good to see him move  o full of Grandeur Grace and Love  He was indeed a Bird for  Jove    He soar'd aloft in  Brucum  's Field  And thousand  Kites  and  Vultures  kill'd  Which made him Dear to all that flew  Unless to  Robin  and his Crew  One Day poor  Bob  puff'd up with Pride  Thinking the Combat to abide  A Goosequill on for Weapon ty'd  Knowing by Use that now and then  A Sword less Hurt do's than a Pen  As for ExampleWhat at home  You've well contriv'd to do at  Rome    A Pen blows upbefore you come  You are suppos'd to undermine  The Foein some immense Design  A Pen can bite you with a Line  There's forty ways to give a Sign  Wellall on Fire away he stalk'd  Till come towhere the  Eagle  walk'd  Bob  did not shill I shall I go  Nor said one word of Friend or Foe  But flirting at him made a Blow  As GameCocks with their Gauntlets do  At which the  Eagle  gracefully  Cast a disdaining sparkling Eye  As who should sayWhat's this a Flie  But no Revenge at all did take  He spar'd him for their Lady's sake  Who ponder'd these things in her Mind  And took the Conduct of the  Eagle  kind  Upon Reflection nowto shew  What harm the least of things may do  Mad  Robin  with his cursed Flirt  One of the  Eagle  's  amongst the  Greeks  signifies Honour as tender the Eye  Eyes had hurt  Inflam'd it made it red and sore  But the Affront inflam'd it more  Oh how the Family did tear  To fire the House could scarce forbear  With Scorn not Pain the  Eagle  fir'd  Murmur'd Disdain and so retir'd  Robin  to offer some Relief  In words like these would heal their Grief  Shou'd th'  Eagle  diewhich Heav'n forbid  We ought some other to provide  I do not say that any now  Are fit but in a Year or Two  And shou'd this mighty Warrior fall  They shou'd not want a General  As Men have long observ'd that one  Misfortune seldom comes alone  Just in the Moment this was done  Ten Thousand Foes in sight were come  Vultures  and  Kites  and Birds of Prey  In Flocks so thickthey darken'd Day  A longconcerted Force and strong  Vermin of all kinds made the Throng  Foxes were in the Faction join'd  Who waited their Approach to ground  By every Hand from common Fame  The frightful Face of Danger came  One cries What help nowwho can tell  I'm glad the  Eagle  's here and well  Another out of Breath with fear  Says Thousands more near Sea appear  They'll swop our Chickens from the Door  We never were so set before  We are glad the  Eagle  will forget  And the Invaders kill or beat  Reserv'd and Great his Noble Mind  Above all petty things inclin'd  Abhor'd the Thoughts of any thing  But what his Lady's Peace cou'd bring  Who Blest him first and bad him do  As he was wont and beat the Foe  Burning and restless as the Sun  Until this willing Work was done  He whets his Talons stretcht his Wings  His Lightning Darts and Terror flings  Tow'rs with a flight into the Sky  These Million Monsters to descry  Prepar'd to Conquer or to Dye  The Party that so far was come  Thought not the  Eagle  was at home  To Fame and Danger used in Field  They knew he'd quickly made 'em yield  But on Assurance he was near  Incumber'd Faint and Dead with fear  They made with Hurry towards the Lakes  And he his Pinions o'er 'em shakes  They had not with such Horrour fill'd  The Courage to let one be kill'd  They fled and left no Foe behind  Unless it were the fleeting Wind  Onlya Man by Water took  Two fine young  Merlins  and a  Roo  The Family had now Repose  But with the Sun the  Eagle  rose  Th' Imperial Bird pursu'd the Foe  More Toil than Rest inur'd to know  He wing'd his Way to  Latian  Land  Where first was hatch'd this murd'ring Band  He darted Death wheree'er he came  Some of 'em dying at his Name  Their mighty Foea fatal Pledge  Their Bowels tore thro' ev'ry Hedge  They Flutter Shriek and Caw and Hiss  Their Strength decays and Fears increase  But most the  Chevaliers  the  Geese    So many slaughter'd Fowl there was  Their Carkasses blockt up the Ways  The rest he drove

Generous Noble Bird  Wast thou not first by him preferr'd  Let's leave him in his Gall to burn  And back to  Pontifell  return  There some to ChimneyTops aspire  To Turrets some that cou'd fly higher  Some 'bove a Hundred Miles were gone  To Roost them at  Byzantium    Alas in vain was their Pretence  He broke thro' all their strong Defence  Down went their Fences Wires and all  Perches and Birds together fall  None hop'd his Power to withstand  But gave the Nest to his Command  They told him of Ten Thousand more  In Flocks along the  Ganges  Shore  Safe in their Furrows free from Trouble  Like  Partridges  among the Stubble▪  He spreads himself and cuts the Air  And steady Flight soon brought him there  Lord how deceiv'd and vext he was  To find they were but meer  Jackdaws    A Hundred Thousand all in sight  They all could Chatter not one Fight  I'll deal by them as is their due  Shough cry'd the  Eagle  off they flew  His flashing Eyes their Hearts confounds  Tho' by their flight secure from Wounds  Which was a signal fatal Baulk  To a late swift  Italian Hawk    The  Eagle  wou'd no Rest afford  Till he had sent my Lady word  Who when she heard the dear Surprise  Wonder and Joy stood in her Eyes  My Faithful  Eagle  hast thou then  My Mortal Foes destroy'd again  Return return and on me wait  Be thou the Guardian of my Gate  Thee and thy Friends are worth my Care  Thy Foes if any such there are  Shall my avenging Anger share  Solest new Ills shou'd intervene  She turn'd the  Robin  out again  The  Samians  now in vast Delight  Bless their good Lady Day and Night  Wish that her Life might ne'er be done  But Everlasting as the Sun  The  Eagle  high again did soar  The Lady was disturb'd no more  But all things flourish'd as before  Robin Red Breast

the Servants wash 'em clean  When she to a fit Age was grown  To be sole Mistress of her own  Then to her Favour and strange Trust  She rais'd these two in rank the first  The Dog who with gilt Collar grac'd  Strutted about The Cat was plac'd  O'er all the House to domineer  And kept each Wight of her in fear  While he o'er all the Plains had pow'r  That savage Wolves might not devour  Her Flocks She gave him charge great Care  To take But Beasts uncertain are  Now see by these what Troubles rise  To those who in their Choice unwise  Put trust in such for he soon join'd  With Beasts of Prey the Dog combin'd  Who kill'd the Sheep and tore the Hind  While he would stand and grin and bark  Concealing thus his Dealings dark  A Wolf or so sometimes he'd take  And then O what a Noise he'd make  But with wild Beasts o'errun yet are  The Plains Some die for want of Fare  Or torn or kill'd the Shepherds find  Each day are lost of ev'ry kind  Thy silly Sheep lament in vain  Of their hard Fate not him complain▪  The Shepherds and the Servants all  Against the Traitor loudly baul  But there was none that dar'd to tell  Their Lady what to them befel  For Puss a Fox of wondrous Art  Brought in to help and take their part  By whose Assistance to deceive  She made her ev'ry Lye believe  One lucky Day when she was walking  In her Woods with Servants talking  And stop'd to hear how very well  A RedBreast sung then him to dwell  With her she call'd He came and took  His place next to a Fav'rite Rook  Where  Robin  soon began to sing  Such Songs as made the House to ring  He sung the Loss and Death of Sheep  In Notes that made the Lady weep  How for his Charge the Dog unfit  Took part with Foes and Shepherds bit  Ev'n from his Birth he did him trace  And shew him Cur of shabby Race  The first by wandring Beggars fed  His Sire advanc'd turn'd Spit for Bread  Himself each trust had still abus'd  To steal what he should guard was us'd  From Puppy known wheree'er he came  Both vile and base and void of Shame  The Cat he sung that none could match  or venom'd Spite or cruel Scratch  That from a Witch transform'd she came  Who kitten'd three of equal Fame  This first one dead of Tabby Fur  The third survives much Noise of her  Had been A Cat well known with ease  On Errands dark o'er Land and Seas  She'd Journeys take to Cub of Bear  From these intriguing Beasts who swear  They'll bring him to defend the Wrong  That they have done Again he sung  How Tabby once in Moonlight Night  Trotted with Letter Fox did write  In which he sends his best Respects  To the SheBear and thus directs  "Madam said he your Cub safe send  "None shall his Worship soon offend  "It's all I can at present do  "To serve him as his Friends well know  At this the Beasts grew in such Rage  That none their Fury could assuage  Nay Puss her Lady would have scratch'd  And tore her Eyes but she was watch'd  For she'd set up her Back and mew  And thrice ev'n in her Face she flew  The Dog like an ungrateful Spark  At her would dare to snarl and bark  Her Tenants wondring stood to hear  That she their Insolence would bear  And offer'd their Assistance to  Soon make them better manners know  But she to avoid all farther Rout  Her Window opening turn'd  Bob  out  Hoping that then her Beasts would live  In Peace and no Disturbance give  Yet nothing she can do avails  Their Rage against her

"To certain heights before unknown  "Of Human Race some shall aloud  "Inflame and arm a dreadful Croud  "Who in vast Numbers shall advance  "And to new Tunes shall make them dance  "When this begins

her to pay undue  Regards unto this Bestial Crew  Tho' these resembled Human Shapes  They were indeed no more than Apes  Who some in House and some in Wood  And others in high Boxes stood  That chatt'ring made such noise and stir  How all was due to Fox and Cur  Till by their false deluding way  She found her Flocks begin to stray  Still  Robin  does for her his Care  And Zeal express on whom yet are  His thoughts all fix'd On her he dreams  Each Night Her Praises are his Themes  n Songs all day Now perch'd on Tree  Finding himself secure and free  He pertly shakes his little Wings  ets up his Throat Again he sings  That she had left no other way  o save her Flocks and end this Fray▪  But soon to her Assistance take  One who could make these Monsters shake  A wellknown Huntsman who has Skill  The fiercest Beasts to tame or kill  At her Command he'd come and he  Would make her great and set them free  That should these Beasts some evil day  Bring Cub into her Grounds she may  Depend that not her self they'll spare  Since to insult her now they dare  All she at best can hope for then  Is to be safe shut up in Den  Since by sure signs all these Ingrate  Are known to bear her deadly Hate  He ends his Song and prays to Heaven  That she may have the Wisdom given  Before it be too late to take  Such Resolutions as may make  Her safe and that these Beasts no more  To ravage in

B Od  Quae Cura Patrum quaeve Quiritium c  Attempted in the Style of  Pindar  Occasion'd by the wonderful Successes of the Arms of Her Majesty and Her Allies With a  LETTER  to a Gentleman in the Ʋniversity  By  Samuel Cobb  M A  LONDON Printed by  H Hills  and Sold by the Booksellers of  London  and  Westminster    A LETTER to a Gentleman in the University  SIR  THIS comes to Congratulate You on the agreeable News of some late extraordinary Successes which have bless'd the Arms of Her Majesty and Her Allies I leave you to the Printed Papers for a particular Account of those Actions which have surpriz'd the World and we hope given the last Stroke to the languishing Power of the Common Enemy of  Europe  They will furnish noble Topics for the Wits of an Ʋniversity like yours who can embellish if that can be done the Glories of a  Female Reign  with a juster Sublimity of Verse than what you will find in the following Performance which was written several Months ago and not run over with a hasty Negligence The Ode from whence I take my Hint is accounted by some Critics not inferior to the    th of the same Book which begins thus  Qualem ministrum fulminis alitem c  And was written in Complement to  Augustus  on occasion of a famous Victory gain'd by  Tiberius  as this which I have aim'd to imitate was written on the Praise of  Claudius Nero  I need not inform Men of your Reading and Letters what occasion'd both The Poet as he does in almost all his Odes has shewn a peculiar Artfulness and Elegance and turns all the Panegyric on the Emperor who was not in the Action with  Te concilium tuos Praebente Divos  If You ask wherein I have trod in the Steps of  Horace  You will find it in the Beginning I have only kept him in view and used him only where he was serviceable  to my Design He took the same liberty with  Alcaeus  as appears from some Fragments of that  Greek  Lyriac quoted by  Athenaeus  In my Digressions and Transitions I have taken care to play always in sight and make every one of them contribute to my main Design This was the Way of  Pindar  to read whom according to  Rapin  will give a truer Idea of the Ode than all the Rules and Reflections of the best Critics I will not pretend to have div'd into him over Head and Ears but I have endeavour'd to have made my self not the greatest Stranger to his Manner of Writing which generally consists in the Dignity of the Sentiments and an elegant Variety which makes the Reader rise up with greater Satisfaction than he sat down And that which affects the Mind in Compositions of any sort will never be disagreeable to a Gentleman of Ingenuity and Judgment I have avoided Turns as thinking that they debase the Loftiness of the Ode You will easily perceive whether I have reach'd that  acer Spiritus Vis  recommended by  Horace  as the Genius of Poetry Whether you will call the following Lines a  Pindaric  Ode or Irregular Stanza's gives me no Disturbance For however the seeming Wildness of this sort of Verse ought to be restrain'd the  Strophe Antistrophe  c will never bear in English and it would shew a strange  Debauchery in our Taste if it should as may be witnessed by the servile Imitation of the Dactyles and Spondees used by Sir  P Sidney  But to make an e  of this tedious Epistle you will see thro' the Whole that Her MAJESTY is the Chief Heroine of the Ode and the Moral at the End shews the solid Glories of a Reign which is not founded on a pretended Justice or Criminal Magnanimity  Yours c S C  THE FEMALE REIGN AN ODE  I  WHAT can the  British Senate  give  To make the Name of  ANNA  live  By Future People to be sung  The Labour of each grateful Tongue  Can faithful Registers or Rhyme  In charming Eloquence or sprightly Wit  The  Wonders of her Reign  transmit  To th' unborn Children of succeeding Time  Can  Painter  's Oil or  Statuary  's Art  Eternity to Her impart  NoTitled Statues are but empty things  Inscrib'd to  Royal Vanity    The Sacrifice of Flattery  To Lawless  Nero  's or  Bourbonian  Kings  True Virtue  to Her  kindred  Stars aspires  Does all our Pomp of Stone and Verse surpass  And mingling with Aetherial Fires  No useless Ornament requires  From  Speaking  Colours or from  Breathing  Brass  II  Greatest of Princes  where the wand'ring Sun  Does o'er Earth's habitable Regions rowl  From th'  Eastern Barriers  to

 Gain'd  he  sad Privilege  to be  The  First  in  Solid  Misery  Monarch of  Hell  and  Woes  and  Endless Night  Corruption of the Best is Worst    And foul Ambition like an Evil Wind  Blights the

then break out to better purpose You tell  your Preface to the  NoProtestant Plot  that you shall be forc'd  after to leave off your Modesty I suppose you mean that little which  left you for it was worn to Rags when you put out this Medal  +ver was there practis'd such a piece of notorious Impudence in the f  of an Establish  d Government I believe when he is dead you  wear him in ThumbRings as the  Turks  did  Scanderbeg  as if  were Virtue in his Bones to preserve you against Monarchy Yet  this while you pretend not only Zeal for the Publick Good but a due  eration for the Person of the King But all Men who can see an  before them may easily detect those gross Fallacies That it is necessa  y for Men in your Circumstances to pretend both is granted you for without them there could be no ground to raise a Faction But I would ask you one civil Question what right has any Man among you or any Association of Men to come nearer to you who out of Parliament cannot be consider'd in a publick Capacity to meet as you daily do in Factious Clubs to vilify the Government in your Discourses and to libel it in all your Writings Who made you Judges in  Isra  l  Or how  it consistent with your Zeal of the Publick Welfare to promote Sedition Does your Definition of Loy  l which is to serve the King according to the Laws allow you the Licence of traducing the Executive Power with which you own he is invested You complain that his Majesty has lost the Love and Confidence of his People and by your very urging it you endeavour what in you lies to make him lose them All g  od subjects abhor the thought of Arbitrary Power whether it be in one or many if you were the Patriots you would seem you would not at this  ate incense the Multit  de to assume it for no sober Man can fear it either from the King's Disposition or his Practice or even where you would odiously lay it from his Ministers Give us leave to enjoy the Government and the Benefit of Laws under which we were born and which we desire to transmit to our Posterity You are not the Trustees of the publick Liberty and if you have not right to petition in a Croud much less have you to intermeddle in the Management of Affairs or to arraign what you do not like which in effect is every thing that is done by the King and Council Can you imagine that any reasonable Man will believe you respect the Person of his Majesty when  apparent that your Seditious Pamphlets are stuff'd w  th particular Reflections on him If you have the Confidence to deny th  s 'tis easie to  e evinc'd from a thousand P  ssages which I only forbear to quote because I desire they should d  e and be forgotten I have perus'd many of  ur Papers and to shew you that I have the third part of your  NoProtestant Plot  is much of it stolen from your dead Author's Pamphlet  ll'd the  Growth of Popery  as manifestly as  Mil  on  's Defence of the  English  People is from  Bucha  a  de jur  regn  apud Sco  os  or your first Covenant and

Aspersions of the King and the same grounds of a Rebellion I  ow not whether you will take the Historian's word who says it was  eported that  P  ltrot  a  Hugonot  murther'd  F  ancis  Duke of  Guise

 p  sing and mur  hering Kings of a different Persuasion in Religion But I am able to  rove from the Doctrine of  Calvin  and Principles of  Bu  h  man  that  hey set the People above the Magistrate which if I mistake not is  your own Fundamental and which carries your Loyalty no farther than your liking When a Vote of the House of Commons goes on your side you a  e as ready to observe it as if it were pass'd into a Law But wh  you are pinch'd with any former and yet unrepealed  Act of Parli  ment  you declare that in some Cases you will not be oblig'd by it The Pas+sage is in the same third part of the  NoProtestant Plot  and is  plain to be denied The late Copy of your intended Association you nei+ther wholly justifie nor condemn But as the Papists when they are u  oppos'd▪ fly out into

proper time to say any thing when Men have all thing in their power  In the mean time you wou'd fain be nibling at a Parallel betwixt t  Association and that in the time of Queen  Elizabeth  But there th  s small difference betwixt them that the ends of one are directly op+posite to the other one with the Queen's Approbation and Conjuncti  as Head of it the other without either the Consent or

the Index of Hebrew Names and Etymologies which are printed at the end of some  English  Bibles If  Achitophel  signifie the Brother of a Fool the Author of that Poem will pass with his Readers for the next of Kin And perhaps 'tis the Relation that makes the Kindness Whatever the Verses are buy 'em up I beseech you out of pity for I hear the Conventicle is shut up and the Brother of  Achitophel  out of Service  Now Footmen you know have the Generosity to make a Purse for a Member of their Society who has had his Livery pull'd over his Ears and even Protestant Socks are bought up among you out of Veneration to the Name A Dissenter in Poetry from Sense and  English  will make as good a Protestant Rhimer as a Dissenter from the Church of  Engl  nd  a Protestant Parson Besides if you encourage a young Beginner who knows but he may elevate his Style a little above the vulgar Epithe  s of prophane and sawcy Jack and Atheistick Scribler with which he treats me when the Fit of Enthusiam is strong upon him by which wellmanner'd and charitable Expressions I was certain of his Sect before I knew his Name What would you have more of a Man he has damn'd me in your Cause from  Genesis  to the  Revelations  And has half the Texts of  both the  Testaments  against me if you will be so civil to your selves as to take him for your Interpreter and not to take them for  Irish  Witnesses After all perhaps you will tell me that you retain'd him only for the opening of your Cause and that your main Lawyer is yet behind Now if it so happen he meet with no more Reply than his Predecessors you may either conclude that I trust to the Goodness of my Cause or fear my Adversary or disdain him or what you please for the short on't is 'tis indifferent to your humble Servant whatever your Party

Boon of thee  When 'tis a doubt if such a thing there be  For Woman in whose Breasts thou'rt said to reign  And show the glorious Conquests thou dost gain  Despises thee and only courts the Name  Sounds tho' we cannot see yet we may hear  And wonder at  heir echoing through the Air  Thus l  d by what delusive Fame imparts  We think thy Throne's erected in their Hearts  But w'are deceiv'd as faith we ever were  For if thou art I'm sure thou art not there  Nothing in those vile Mansions does reside  But rank Ambition Luxury and Pride  Pride is the Deity they most adore  Hardly their own dear selves they cherish more  Survey their very Looks you'll find it there  How can you miss it when 'tis ev'ry where  Some through all hunted Natures Secrets trace  To fill the Furrows of a wrinkl'd Face  And after all their toyl pray mark the Curse  They've only made that which was bad much worse  As some in striving to make ill Coin pass  Have but the more discover'd that 'twas Brass  Nay those that are reputed to be fair  And know how courted how admir'd they are  Who one would think God had form'd so compleat  They had no need to make his Gifts a Cheat  Yet they too in Adulteration share  And wou'd in spight of Nature be more fair  Deluded Woman tell me where's the Gain  In spending Time upon a thing so vain  Your precious Time O to your selves unkind  When 'tis uncertain you've an hour behind  Which you can call your own For tho' y'are Fair  And beautiful as Guardian Angels are  Adorn'd by Nature fitted out by Art  In all the Glories that delude the Heart  Yet tell me tell have they the pow'r to save  Or can they privilege you from the Grave  The Grave which favours not the Rich or Fair  Beauty with Beast lies undistinguish'd there  But holdmethinks I'm interrupted here  By some vain Fop I neither Love nor Fear  Who in these words his weakness does reveal  And hurts that Wound which he shou'd strive to heal  'Soft Sir methinks you too inveterate grow  'And more your Envy than Discretion show  'Who'd blame the Sun because he shines so bright  'That we can't gaze upon his dazling Light  'When at the same time he chears the Earth  'And gives the various Plant and Blossoms Birth  'How does the Winter look that naked thing  'Compar'd to the fresh Glories of the Spring  'Rivers adorn the Earth the Fish the Seas  'Flowers and Grass the Meadows Fruit the Trees  'The Stars the Fields of Air thro' which they ride  'And Woman all the Works of God beside  'Yet base detracting Envy won't allow  'They should adorn themselves then pray Sir now  'Produce some Reasons why you're so severe  'For envious as you are you know they're fair  And so were  Sodom  's Apples heretofore  But they were still found rotten at the Core  Nature without dispute made all things fair  And dress'd 'em in an unaffected Air  The Earth the Meadows Rivers ev'ry Flower  Proclaim the Skill of their great Maker's Pow'r  But they as they were made at first remain  And all their ancient Lustre still retain  Nothing but vain fantastick Woman's chang'd  And through all Mischiefs various Mazes rang'd▪  Yet that they're beautiful is not deny'd  But tell me are the Unhandsome free from Pride  No no the Strait the Crooked Ugly Fair  Have all promiscuously an equal share  Thus Sir you see how they're estrang'd and stray'd  From what by Nature they at first were made  Already many of their Crimes I've nam'd  Yet that's untold for which they most are Fam'd  A Sin tall as the Pyramids of old  From whose aspiring top we may behold  Enough to damn a Worldwhat should it be  But Curse upon the Name  Inconstancy  O tell me does the World those Men contain  For I have look'd for such but look'd in vain  Who ne'er were drawn into that fatal Snare  Fatal I call it for he's curst that's there  Inspir'd then by my Fellowsufferers wrongs  And glad I am the Task to me belongs  I'll bring the Fiend unmask'd to humane sight  Tho' hid in the black Womb of deepest Night  No more the Wind the faithless Wind shall be  A Simile for their Inconstancy  For that sometimes is fixt but Woman's Mind  Is never fixt or to one Point inclin'd  Less fixt than in a Storm the Billows are  Or trembling Leaf the  Aspen  Tree does bear  Which ne'er stand still but ev'ry way inclin'd  Turn twenty times with the least breath of wind  Less fixt than wanton Swallows while they play  In the Sunbeams to welcome in the Day  Now yonder now they're here as soon as there  In no Place long and yet are ev'ry where  Lake a toss'd Ship their passions fall and rise  One while you'd think it touch'd the very Skies  When streight upon the S  n  it groveling lies  Ev'n she her self  Sylvia  th' lov'd and Fair  Whose one kind Look cou'd save me from Despair  She she whose Smiles I valu'd at that rate  To enjoy them I scorn'd the Frowns of Fate  Ev'n she her self but Ah I'm loth to tell  Or blame the Crimes of one I lov'd so well  But it must out ev'n she swift as the Wind  Swift as the airy Motions of the Mind  At once prov'd false and perjur'd and unkind  Here they to Day invoke the Pow'rs above  As Witnesses to their Immortal Love  When lo away the airy Fantom flies  And e'er it can be said to live it dies  Thus all Religious Vows they break  With the same Ease and Freedom as they speak  Nor is that sacred Idol Marriage free  Marriage which musty Drones affirm to be  The tye of Souls as well as Bodies nay  The Spring that does through unseen Pipes convey  Fresh Sweets to Life and drives the bitter Dregs away  The Sacred Flame the Guardian Pile of Fire  That guides our Steps to Peace nor does expire  Till it has left us nothing to desire  Ev'n thus adorn'd the Idol is not free  From the sw  ft turns of their Inconstancy  Witness th'  Ephesian  Matron  Who to the Grave with her dead Husband went  And clos'd her self up in his Monument  Where on Marble she lamenting lay  n sighs she spent the Night in Tears the Day  And seem'd to have no use of Life but mourn it all away  The wond'ring World extoll'd her faithful Mind  Extoll'd her as the best of Womankind  But see the World's Mistake and with it see  The strange effect of wild Inconstancy  or she her self ev'n in that Sacred Room  With one brisk vig'rous Onset was o'ercome  nd made a Brothel of her Husband's Tomb  Whose pale Ghost trembl'd in his Sacred Shrowd  Wond'ring that Heav'n t  ' Impious Act

the Dictates of her Mind  t with a Boldness suited to her kind  She made her Husband's Ghost in Death a Slave  Her necessary Pimp ev'n in his Grave  What need I fetch these Instances from old  There now live those that are as bad and bold  Of Quality too Young Vig'rous Lustful Fair  But for their Husbands sakes their Names I spare  Are these ye Gods the Virtues of a Wife  The Peace that crowns a Matrimonial Life  Is this the Sacred Prize for which we fight  And hazard Life and Honour with delight  Bliss of the Day and Rapture of the Night  The Reins that guide us in our wild Careers  And the Supporter of our feeble Years  No no 'tis Contradiction rather far  They are the cause of all our Bosom War  The very Source and Fountain of our Woe  From whence Despair and Doubt for ever flow  The Gall that mingles with our best delight  Rank to the Taste and nauseous to the Sight  A Days the weight of Care that clogs the Breast  At Night the Hags that does disturb our Rest  Our mortal Sickness in the midst of Health  Chains in our Freedom Poverty in Wealth  Th' Eternal Pestilence and Plague of Life  Th' Original and Spring of all our Strife  These rather are the Virtues of a clam'rous Wife  O why ye awful Pow'rs why was't your Will  To mix our solid Good with so much Ill  But you foresaw our Crimes wou'd soar too high  And so made them your Vengeance to supply  For not the wild destructive waste of War  Nor all the endless Lab'rinths of the Bar  Famine Revenge perpetual loss of Health  No nor that grinning Fiend Despair it self  When it insults with most tyrannick sway  Can plague or torture Man so much as they  But hold don't let me blame the Pow'rs Divine  Or at the wondrous Works they made repine  All at first was good form'd by the unerring Will  Tho' much has since degen'rated to ill  Ev'n Woman was say they made chaste and good  But Ah not long in that blest State she stood  Swift as a Meteor glides thro' Air she fell  And show'd to love that Sex too much is one sure way to Hell  But stop my Pen for who can comprehend  Or trace those Crimes which n  'er can have an end  The Sun the Moon the Stars that gild the Sky  The World and all its Glories too must dye  And in one universal Ruin lye  But they ev'n Immortality will gain  And livebut must for ever live in pain  For ever live damn'd to eternal Night  And never more review the Sacred Light  Beware then dull deluded Man beware  And let not vicious Women be the Snare  To make you the Companions with 'em there  Scorn their vain Smiles their little Arts despise  And your Content at that just value prize  As not to let those rav'nous Thieves of Prey  Rifle and bear the sacred Guest away  'Tis they 'tis they that rob us of that Gem  How could we lose it were it not for them  Avoid 'em then with all the gaudy Arts  They daily practise to amuse our Hearts  Avoid 'em as you wou'd avoid their Crimes  Or the mad Follies that infest the Times  But now shou'd some for doubtless we may find  Many a stupid Ass among Mankind  Shou'd such contemn the wholsome Rules I give  And in contempt of what I've spoke still live  Like base soul'd Slaves and Fetters chuse to wear  When they may be as unconfin'd as Air  Or the wing'd Race that do inhabit there  May all the Plagues an ill Wife can invent  Pursue 'em with eternal Punishment  May theybut stay may Curses I forestall  For in that Curse I've comprehended all  But say Sir if some Pilot on the Main  Shou'd be so mad so resolutely vain  To steer his Bark upon that fatal Shore  Where he has seen ten thousand wrack't before  Tho' he shou'd perish there say wou'd you not  Bestow a Curse on the Notorious Sot  Trust me the Man's as much to blame as he  Who ventures his frail Bark out wilfully  On the Wild Rocky Matrimonial See  When

PREFACE  TO all you Gentlemen if so I may stile you since you are hardly wellbred and tell so many Lies every Day behind the Counter who are born Cookneys and  ive within the Sound of  BowBell  I make these following Papers as a Present well knowing that you now sit biting  our Fingers in your Shops or toying with your Wives and  ave little or nothing to do All the fine Birds are flown be  Beau Monde  have forsaken you and what you get now  believe in a whole Summer's Day you may put in your Eyes  nd 'twill no ways hinder you from seeing your Horns unless  ou are fond of those Vipers which you hug in your Bosoms and  re so wonderfully complaisant to your Wives that you will give  m no manner of Occasion to think you any ways troublesome  nd impertinent by having jealous Pates or encroaching up  n that Liberty and Freedom which your Wives as Citizens  hink they have a Charter for  Perhaps the following Lines may give you some Entertain  ent or serve to amuse you a While 'till Fame's loud Trum  t shall eccho a Victory to our Shore which will be more a  eable to you than those stollen Delights which your Help  es are now enjoying your absence are to them But alas  t most of you are hornify'd is no more News tho' you mentedly enough put the Disgrace in your Pockets than if  y one should say there is Bribery us'd in Elections that some the Parliament House are wiser than others or that a young  idow who has had the Pleasure of the shaking of the She  ts  ls to be marry'd again Come come take Heart of  Grace my Lads don't be disconsolate I make no Doubt but that you will shortly hear of a Battle that will find you Yalk enough for all the Vacation and set your Tongues a moving as nimbly in every Coffeehouse you come at as that of  CourtLady somewhat overtaken with drinking Hartshor  and Brandy  As I said before seeing you have little or nothing to do tho' you had rather be accounted Cuckolds than jealous Hu  bands yet it would not be amiss to visit your Wives once  Week that so by the Beating of their Pulse you may discove  whether their Blood be in a Ferment or no or when last thei  Bodies had some unlawful Agitations Besides since Natu  is very craving and her Wants must one Way or other be su  +ply'd it would be better for you to enjoy the lawful Embrace of your own Spouses than engender with that fulsome Crap  which at this dead Time of the Year is left in Town  I protest I almost pity you and am sorry that your Wiv  should so impose upon you Some roaring Bully or recruiti  Officer in the Country makes his own Game with them an  Women are in one Respect the Reverse of the TurkeyCoc  they are wonderfull affected with a Red Coat Since th  your Shops are so empty of Customers and your Trade is so dea  I would advise you to repent of all the Lies that you told b  +hind your Counters last Term to make your Accompts up bo  between God and Man go to Church with a safe Conscience read the News chearfully and since your Circumstances  present will not allow you to drink Wine fancy Tea and Coffe  B  rgundy and Campaign  THE Long Vacation  BLESS us how silent is the noisy Gown  How quiet are the  Temples Park  and Town  As if  Astraea  Great in  Anna  's Reign  Had banish'd Law to some deserted Plain  No Gouty Jce sits upon the Bench  ndulgent to a Bottle and a Wench  Altho' his Rev'rend Garb and Brow severe  Promise his Morals and his Sould austere  Now sacred Peace finds a secure Retreat  Where Laws and Justice held their awful Seat  Not on Demurrers now the Serjeants drudge  Nor crabbed Pleas detain the hungry Judge  Each S now may rest in ElbowChair  His veterane Limbs broke with nocturnal Care  n turning over Volumes and the Fair  No knotty Doubts his solid Ease beguile  His Rev'rend  Coke  the dusty Cobwebs spoil  Grave  Littleton  and  Leveing  too lie idle  He reads them now no oftner than the  Bible    The jangling Laws tho' insolently rude  Dare not upon his peaceful Hours intrude  Wine chears his Soul and his obliging Eyes  hew he's not dead to charming Mistresses  Tho' at the Bar in Term you'd hardly think  That he had Pow'r enough to whore or drink  But that the charming Beauties of the Fair  Were far above his Notice or his Care  uch Furrows in his aged Cheeks appear  Yet ho's his Looks an Air most solemn shew  His powder'd Wig discovers he's a Beau  And that when serious Business don't intrude  His Worship can be both gallant and lewd  THe  Ct  's  Kitchin  as his Brains is cold  No longer now litigious Crowds make bold  To knock him up and buy their Peace with Gold  No more he sees his Chambers like a Fair  Of Clients full and nev'r a Pauper there  No longer now he props with noblest Wines  His Age and at the  Devil  sups and dines  Nor does the Porter light him to his Bed  'Twixt Twelve and One by trusty Drawers led  The Pettyfogger who keeps such a House  Would starve a Church or ancient College Mouse  Hangs down his Ears and now begins to miss  His sumptuous Meals and Termtime Luxuries  Just as his Looks so does his Purse grow thin  Paleness without and Emptiness within  Quickly he thinks it prudent to repair  To some convenient Seat for Country Air  Carrying himself with Paultry present down  His Board he spunges on some Rural Clown  'Till the kind Term returns him to the Town  Trusting in Impudence which seldom fails  Some silvane Nymph perchance the Fop assails  The ruddy Maid at first receives his Flame  And vows her Spark's  a pretty Gentleman    Tho' whatsoe'er he to his Mistress says  Is stoll'n from  D'Urfey  's or from  Settle  's Plays  In vain he shews th' abundance of his Sense  And charms the Fair with borrow'd Eloquence▪  For soon malicious Fortune makes it clear  That he's som paultry tricking  Wappineer  Good Gods how dull his Courtship is How lame  How soon he quits his bold presumptuous Flame  Wing'd with Disgrace he flies the Hills and Groves  And Vallies conscious of his slighted Loves  He hastes to Town there meets what he deserves  And twice two Months the Scoundrel Scribler starves  Till the returning Winter chears the Laws  And the glad Term a Scene of Business draws  Thus when the Woods by some Autumnal Blast  Their verdant Leaves and shady Honours cast  The sick'ning Trees their ravish'd Beauties mourn  Till circling Hours the joyful Spring return  Till the warm Sun with his resplendent Beams  Thaws Nature's Bolts and soon unlocks the Streams  His vital Heat the flowing Rills enlarge  And the glad Fish from Icy Nets discharge  So at th' Appearance of the blooming Spring  The Feather'd Quoiristers rejoyce and sing  While they in Fields their tuneful Notes prepare  And with soft Musick bless th' harmonious Air  The weary Press at Ease in Safety sleeps  No supple Oil the Polish'd Iron keeps  The Hawkers now we very rarely meet  Faction and Treason venting in the Street  From  Will  's and  Tom  's the welldress'd Youths are fled  And Silence there with Poppies binds her Head  To Country Seats the Men of Sense go down  And for their rural Joys neglect the Town  Some few sham Battles bellow'd out at Night  And Apparitions now the Mob affright  Commets and Armies fighting in the Air  Seen by the Lord knows whom the Lord knows where  Our tuneful Bards and Pamphleteers are fled  Morphew  and  Bragge  protest their Trade is dead  Upon the Stage no newborn Scenes arise  No Lightnings flash from  Imoinda  Eyes  The Bastard's Blood not injur'd  Edgar  spills  o save a Father not a Brother kills  Nor yet blind  Gloucester  's sad Intent defeats  And his rash Sire with pious Falshood cheats  Near  Elsenore  nor  Hamlet  's regal Ghost  Speaks to his Son on young  Horatio  's Post  Themselves not  Aetius  or  Lucina  kill  The passive Subjects to a Tyrant's Will  With lawless Fires nor does not  Barry  burn  And lewdly act the Daughter of the Sun  No captive  Bajazet  or Heroes storm  No  Desdamona  with Angelick Form  Is doom'd most lovely as she is to die  For her  Othello  's hotbrain'd Jealousy  No lost  Statira  with her blooming Charms  Ensnares Great  Phillip  's from Wars and Arms  No diff'rent passions now the Hero move  And wreck his Soul 'twixt Empire and Love  Here no Sir  Fopling  with his modish Dress  Laughs at the Age's monst'rous Fopperies  No merry Beggars here their Revels keep  The Poets starve and the nine Sisters sleep  Far from the Town the fair  Camilla  fled  To  Tunbridge  there the rural Grass to tread  Arsinoe  the Theatre forsakes  And from  Augusta  far her Lodging takes  The Actors too must take the pleasant Air  To  Oxford  some to  Sturbridge  some repair  And quite debauch the hopeful Students there  There in some Country Shed  The Tinfel Kings contentedly lie down  And quite forget the Business of a Crown  No costly Wines their wond'ring Gust surprize  Brandy and Ale their Royal Thirst suffice  And when their Hearts by nappy Bowls made light  Some ruddy Blouze sprawl in their Arms at Night  Whose vig'rous Race are well by Fate decreed  To help our Peers and mend  St  's Breed  The  British  Beauties now in Crowds resort  Within  Vinsoria  's Walls or  HamptonCourt    Where Royal  Anna  keeps her stately Seat  And free from Crowds enjoys a soft Retreat  Some to the  Bath  most cautiously repair  To keep their Beauties from polluted Air  And blooming Nature Fence from fatal Shocks  Both of the lesser and the greater Pox  There they a thousand Pangs and Joys impart  And with sure Arrows wound the boldest Heart  There they display the Glories of their Eyes  And make unguarded Man a Sacrifice  Between their Bed the Toylet and their Glass  And giving Visits all their Moments pass  Th' admire the Beaus and are by them admir'd  With equal Charms the wanton Crowd is fir'd  They laugh they sport they dance they toy and sing  No days nor Hours the Fops to Reason bring  Here  Clòe  once most insolently coy  Who hated Love and Love's surprizing Joy  She who in Town the fiercest Storms withstood  Plainly discovers now she's Flesh and Blood  And gives her VirginTreasure which before  She valu'd higher than the glitt'ring Store  Of  Tagus  Golden Sands  Athiests and Parsons here alike repair  To drink the Waters and imbibe the Air  Bawds Matrons Punks commend the pregnant Steel  But something else the fertile Ladies feel  Sharpers at Dice consume the wasting Day  The Fair for something else than Money play  And when vast Sums these lovely Losers set  They with their Persons pay the desp'rate Debt  They Cit to  Epsom  brings that Chain of Life  That sawcy scolding Termagant his Wife  Where for two Months that she may gay appear  He spends the future Gains of half a Year  Whate'er the Hills or richer Vales produce  The Swains prepare for her luxurious Use  Mutton the Downs  CaseHanton  Trouts afford  And ev'ry  Park  finds Ven'son for her Board  But little thinks the wild expensive Fair  What fertile Ills her Vanities prepare  Twice e'er the fiery Coursers of the Sun  Have view'd each Pole their annual Labour done  In the  Queen'sB  nch  we shall her Husband meet  In  Ludgate  lock'd or Pris'ner in the  Fleet    Commission'd Harpies his Effects shall claim  And the  Gazette  shall publish thrice his Name  But fearless now of Dangers unforeseen  He haunts the Walks the Coffeehouse and Green  Waters and Wine do all his Hours divide  Heated and cool'd by their alternate Tide  With Mirth and Wine th' uxorious Coxcomb drunk  Little Regards his dear dissembling Punk  Who to the crowded Playhouse 'mongst the Beaus  Resorts or else to  New SpringGarden  goes  For here the famous  Powell  Roscius  of the Age  In tragick Buskins treads the rural Stage  The ancient Bards in long lost Plays revive  And by their Wit th' industrious Actors thrive  Each conscious Scene th' am'rous Jilt admires  And in her Bosom feels extinguish'd Fires  For some loose Actor's brawny Back she burns  Is lewd again and her hot Fit returns  Gods how she praises  Valentinian  's Shape  And sighing wishes chast  Lucina  's Rape  With that fierce Joys could she  One of the Libertines Companions  Antonio  meet  Was he not quite so lewd and more discreet  For bold  Almanzor  's Strength the Wanton dies  And views his Action with desiring Eyes  When the gay Scenes are o'er the Fair retreat  To silent Shades where they their Lovers meet  And in fresh Raptures all their Joys repeat  The Country 'Squire makes his Acquaintance drunk  And falls enamor'd on some  London  Punk  Who sets the rustick Coxcomb all on Fire  And Warms his Breast with impudent Desire  Hither the  CoventGarden  Crack repairs  With bought Complection and with borrow'd Hairs▪  And while her Spark whole Towns to Ashes turns  His Dam'sel here intriguing Coxcombs burns  At first my Lord with a reluctant Frown  Pulls up her Cloaths and throws the Wanton down▪  But when Necessity and Want assail  Int'rest and Gain above her Pride prevail  On easy Terms she'll on the Grass be still  And let his Lordship's Butler kiss his Fill  The smiling Semptress now her Shop forsakes  Here vents her Ware and better Bargains makes  Here in unlawful Joys and stoll'n Delight  Both Rich and Poor spend the polluted Night  The Bankrupt Vintners starve for want of Trade  Few Payments now are to the Merchants made  Score in the Bar  the Master seldom bawls  Nor little Bell the tardy Drawer calls  Rarely the Cook now Cutlets broils of Veal  But unemploy'd into the Cellar steals  There she and  Tom  to broach a Cask combine  And 'gainst a Butt she spills her Master's Wine  Few drunken Catches now at Night we hear  Sad pensive Looks in ev'ry Post appear  Their  Dragon Horns  and  Fish  neglected lie  And all the Rubies in their Faces die  No dirty Feet pollute their cleanly Floors  Nor three for two the sleepy Mistress scores  Whilst newcome Guests past one disturb her Nap  And to get in at the clos'd wicket rap  Their Brewings Mixtures all are at a Stand  And their Prick'd Cyder frets upon their Hand  The Merchant now to rural Village runs  Enjoys the Country Air and scapes his Duns  Who only now can teaze him by the Post  For Goods exported in the  Tygar  lost  The buzzing  Change  and  Gresham  's Walks grow thin  Catchpoles without and Brokers sweat within  Few others to the stately Dome repair  Now unfrequented as a House of Pray'r  Guy  's Infantry unarm'd and idle stands  No Quarts or Glasses tire their trembling Hands  To  Jonathan  's but few StockJobbers go  They only meet to forge good News or so  The Quack forbears to swell the Weekly Bills  And avaritious Death but slowly kills  Fevers can scarce the Doctor's Room supply  And cheap and honestly the Vulgar die  The Sexton groans to view his rusty Spade  And greedy Curates moan their Want of Trade▪  The Bearers sigh and the sad PassingBell  Bur rarely now the Deads Departure tell  Late to the  Park  no whining Beaus repair  And tell their Passion to th' am'rous Fair  No burning Flambeaux light the dolesome Shade  Nor Waxen Beams strike thro' the verdant Glade  The fierce Patroul which march the Rounds by Night  Wild Ducks and Geese their sole Spectators fright  Round the Canal no newmade Prints appear  No cooing Lovers in the Grove we hear  The waking Soldiers only guard the Deer  On the Parade no haughty Col'nels meet  In Order to consult where they may eat  Or to advise who sells the noblest Wine  And where from Duns they may securely dine  Young Ensigns now at  Man  's no longer swear  Nor cully'd Gamesters fret and wrangle there  Tricktrack and Basset now no longer please  And Cards are banish'd but

this Bugbear Death to frighten Man  If Souls can die as well as Bodies can  For as before our Birth we felt no Pain  When punick Arms infested Land and Main  When Heav'n and Earth were in Confusion hurl'd  For the debated Empire of the World  Which aw'd with dreadful Expectation lay  Sure to be Slaves uncertain who shou'd sway  So when our mortal Frame shall be disjoyn'd  The lifeless Lump uncoupled from the Mind  From Sense of Grief and Pain we shall be free  We shall not feel because we shall not  Be    Though Earth in Seas and Seas in Heav'n were lost  We shou'd not move we only shou'd be tost  Nay ev'n suppose when we have suffer'd Fate  The Soul cou'd feel in her divided state  What's that to us for we are only we  While Souls and Bodies in one Frame agree  Nay tho' our Atoms shou'd revolve by chance  nd Matter leap into the former Dance  Tho' time our Life and Motion cou'd restore  nd make our Bodies what they were before  What Gain to us wou'd all this bustle bring  The new made Man wou'd be another thing  Then once an interrupting pause is made  That Individual Being is decay'd  e who are dead and gone shall  ear no part  all the Pleasures nor shall feel the smart  Which to that other Mortal shall accrew  Whom of our Matter Time shall mould anew  or backward if you look on that long space  f Ages past and view the changing Face  f Matter tost and variously combin'd  sundry Shapes 'tis easie for the mind  rom thence t' infer that Seeds of things have been  the same Order as they now are seen  Which yet our dark Remembrance cannot trace  ecause a pause of Life a gaping space  as come betwixt where Memory lies dead  nd all the wandring Motions from the Sense are fled  or whosoe'er shall in Misfortunes live  Must  Be  when those Misfortunes shall arrive  nd since the Man who  Is  not seels not Woe  For Death exempts him and wards off the Blow  Which we the living only feel and bear  What is there left for us in Death to fear  When ocne that pause of Life has come between  is just the same as we had never been  nd therefore if a Man bemoan his Lot  hat after Death his mouldring Limbs shall rot  Flames or Jaws of Beasts devour his Mass  now he's an unsincere unthinking Ass  secret Sting remains within his mind  The Fool is to his own cast Offals kind  e boasts no sense can after Death remain  et makes himself a part of Life again  s if some other He could feel the pain  If while he live this Thought molest his Head  What Wolf or Vulture shall devour me dead  He wasts his Days in idle Grief nor can  Distinguish 'twixt the Body and the Man  But thinks himself can still himself survive  And what when dead he feels not feels alive  Then he repines that he was born to die  Nor knows in Death there is no other He  No living He remains his Grief to vent  And o'er his senseless Carcass to lament  If after Death 'tis painful to be torn  By Birds and Beasts then why not so to burn  Or drench'd in Floods of Honey to be soak'd  Imbalm'd to be at once preserv'd and choak'd  Or on an airy Mountain's Top to lie  Expos'd to Cold and Heav'ns Inclemency  Or crouded in a Tomb to be opprest  With Monumental Marble on thy Breast  But to be snatch'd from all thy Houshold Joys  From thy Chast Wife and thy dear prattling Boys  Whose little Arms about thy Legs are cast  And climbing for a Kiss prevent their Mother's hast  Inspiring secret Pleasure thro' thy Breast  All these shall be no more thy Friends opprest  Thy Care and Courage now no more shall free  Ah Wretch thou cry'st ah miserable me  One woful Day sweeps Children Friends and Wife  And all the brittle Blessings of my Life  Add one thing more and all thou say'st is true  Thy want and wish of them is vanish'd too  Which well consider'd were a quick Relief  To all thy vain imaginary Grief  For thou shalt sleep and never wake again  And quitting Life shall quit thy living Pain  But we thy Friends shall all those Sorrows find  Which in forgetful Death thou leav'st behind  No time shall dry our tears nor drive thee from our mind  The worst that can befal thee measur'd right  s a sound Slumber and a long good Night  Yet thus the Fools that would be thought the Wits  Disturb their Mirth with melancholy Fits  When Healths go round and kindly Brimmers flow  Till the fresh Garlands on their Foreheads glow  They whine and cry let us make haste to live  hort are the Joys that human Life can give  Eternal Preachers that corrupt the Draught  nd pall the God that never thinks with Thought  deots with all that Thought to whom the worst  Of Death is want of Drink and enless Thirst  Or any fond Desire as vain as these  or ev'n in Sleep the Body wrapt in Ease  upinely lies as in the peaceful Grave  nd wanting nothing nothing can it crave  Were that sound Sleep Eternal it were Death  et the first Atoms then the Seeds of Breath  re moving near to Sense we do but shake  nd rouze that Sense and streight we are awake  Then Death to us and Death's Anxiety  less than nothing if a less cou'd be  or then our Atoms which in order lay  re scatter'd from their heap and puff'd away  nd never can return into their place  When once the pause of Life has left an empty space  nd last suppose Great Nature's Voice shou'd call  o thee or me or any of us all  What dost thou mean ungrateful Wretch thou vain  hou mortal thing thus idly to complain  nd sigh and sob that thou shalt be no more  or if thy Life were pleasant heretofore  all the bounteous Blessings I cou'd give  hou hast enjoy'd if thou hast known to live  nd Pleasure not leak thro' thee like a Sieve  Why dost thou not give thanks as at a plenteous Feast  am'd to the Throat with Life and rise and take thy Rest  But if my Blessings thou hast thrown away  If indigested Joys pass'd thro' and wou'd not stay  Why dost thou wish for more to squander still  If Life we grown a Load a real Ill  And I wou'd all thy Cares and Labours end  Lay down thy Burden Fool and know thy Friend  To please thee I have empti'd all my Store  I can invent and can supply no more  But run the round again the round I ran before  Suppose thou art not broken yet with Years  Yet still the selfsame Scene of things appears  And wou'd be ever cou'dst thou ever live  For Life is still but Life there's nothing new to give  What can we plead against so just a Bill  We stand convicted and our Cause goes ill  But if a Wretch a Man opprest by Fate  Shou'd beg of Nature to prolong his Date  She speaks aloud to him with more Disdain  Be still thou Martyr Fool thou covetous of Pain  But if an old decrepit Sot lament  What thou She cries who hast outliv'd content  Dost thou complain who hast enjoy'd my Store  But this is still th' effect of wishing more  Unsatisfy'd with all that Nature brings  Loathing the present liking absent things  From hence it comes thy vain Desires at strife  Within themselves have tantaliz'd thy Life  And ghastly Death appear'd before thy sight  E'er thou hadst gorg'd thy Soul and Senses with delight  Now leave those Joys unsuiting to thy Age  To a fresh Comer and resign the Stage  Is Nature to be blam'd if thus she chide  No sure for 'tis her Business to provide  Against this ever changing Frame's decay  New things to come and old to pass away  One being worn another Being makes  Chang'd but not lost for Nature gives and takes  New Matter must be found for things to come  And these must waste like those and follow Nature's Doom  All things like thee have time to rise and rot  And from each other's Ruin are begot  For Life is not confin'd to him or thee  Tis giv'n to all for Use to none for Property  Consider former Ages past and gone  Whose Circles ended long e'er thine begun  Then tell the Fool what part in them thou hast  Thus may'st thou judge the future by the past  What Horror seest thou in that quiet State  What Bugbear Dreams to fright thee after Fate  No Ghost no Goblins that still passage keep  But all is there serene in that eternal Sleep  For all the dismal Tales that Poets tell  Are verify'd on Earth and not in Hell  No  Tantalus  looks up with fearful eye  Or dreads th' impending Rock to crush him from on high  But Fear of Chance on Earth disturbs our easie Hours  Or vain imagin'd Wrath of vain imagin'd Pow'rs  No  Tityus  torn by Vultures lies in Hell  Nor cou'd the Lobes of his rank Liver swell  To that prodigious Mass for their eternal Meal  Not tho' this monstrous Bulk had cover'd o'er  Nine spreading Acres or nine thousand more  Not tho' the Globe of Earth had been the Giants Floor  Nor in eternal Torments cou'd he lie  Nor cou'd his Corps sufficient Food supply  But he's the  Tityus  who by Love opprest  Or Tyrant Passion preying on his Breast  And ever anxious Thoughts is robb'd of Rest  The  Sisiphus  is he whom Noise and Strife  educe from all the soft retreats of Life  To vex the Government disturb the Laws  Drunk with the Fumes of popular Applause  He courts the giddy Croud to make him great  And sweats and toils in vain to mount the sovereign Seat  For still to aim at Pow'r and still to fail  Ever to strive and never to prevail  What is it but in Reason's true Account  To heave the Stone against the rising Mount  Which urg'd and labour'd and forc'd up with Pain  Recoild and rowls impetuous down and smokes along t  Pla  Then still to treat thy ever craving mind  With ev'ry Blessing and of ev'ry kind  Ye never fill thy rav'ning Appetite  Though Years and Season vary thy Delight  Yet nothing to be seen of all thy store  But still the Wolf within thee barks for more  This is the Fable's Moral which they tell  Of fifty foolish Virgins damn'd in Hell  To leaky Vessels which the Liquor spill  To Vessels of their Sex which none cou'd ever fill  As for the Dog the Furies and their Snakes  The gloomy Caverns and the burning Lakes  And all the vain infernal Trumpery  They neither are nor were nor e'er can be  But here on Earth the guilty have in view  The mighty Pains to m  ghty Mischiefs due  Racks Prisons Poisons  Tarpeian  Rock  Stripes Hangmen Pitch and suffocating Smoak  And last and most if these were cast behind  Th' avenging horror of a Conscious mind  Whose dealy Fear anticipates the Blow  And sees no end of Punishment and Woe  But looks for more at the last Gasp of Breath  This makes an Hell on Earth and Life a Death  Mean time when Thoughts of Death disturb thy Head  Consider  Ancus  great and good is dead  Ancus  thy better far was born to die  And thou dost thou bewail Mortality  So many Monarchs with their mighty State  Who rul'd the World were overrul'd by Fate  That haughty King who Lorded o'er the Main▪  And whose stupendo  s Bridge did the wild Waves restrain  In vain they foam'd in vain thy threatned Wreck  While his pro  d Le  ions march'd upon their Back  Him Death a greter Monarch overcame  Nor spar'd his Guards the more for their Immortal Name  The  Roman  Chief the  Carthaginians  dread  Scipio  the ThunderBolt of War is dead  And like a common Slave by Fate in Triumph led  The Founders of invented Arts are lost  And Wits who made Eternity their Boast  Where now is  Homer  who possest the Throne  Th' immortal Work remains the mortal Author's gone  Democritus  perceiving Age invade  His Body weaken'd and his Mind decay'd  Obey'd the Summons with a chearful Face  Made haste to welcome Death and met him half the Race  That Stroke ev'n  Epicurus  cou'd not bar  Though he in Wit surpass'd Mankind as far  As does the Midday Sun the Midnight Star  And thou dost thou disdain to yield thy Breath  Whose very Life is little more than Death  More than one half by lazy Sleep possest  And then a wake thy Soul but nods at best  Daydreams and sickly Thoughts revolving in thy Breast  Eternal Troubles haunt thy anxious Mind  Whose Cause and Cure thou never hop'st to find  But still uncertain with thy self at strife  Thou wander'st in the  Labyrinth  of Life  O if the foolish Race of Man who find  A weight of Cares still pressing on their Mind  Cou'd find as well the Cause of this unrest  And all this Burthen lodg'd within the Breast  Sure they wou'd change their Course nor live as now  Uncertain what to wish or what to vow  Uneasie both in Country and in Town  They search a place to lay their Burthen down  One restless in his Palace walks abroad  And vainly thinks to leave behind the Load  But straight returns for he's as restless there  And finds there's no Relief in open Air  Another to his  Villa  wou'd retire  And spurs as hard as if it were on Fire  No sooner enter'd at his Country Door  But he begins to stretch and yawn and snore  Or seeks the City which he left before  Thus every Man o'erworks his weary Will  To shun himself and to shake off his ill  The shaking Fit returns and hangs upon him still  No prospect of Repose nor hope of Ease  The Wretch is ignorant of his Disease  Which known wou'd all his fruitless Trouble spare  For he wou'd know the World not worth his Care  Then wou'd he search more deeply for the Cause  And study Nature well and Nature's Laws  For in this moment lies not the Debate  But on our future fix'd Eternal State  That neverchanging State which all must keep  Who Death has doom'd to everlasting Sleep  Why are we then so fond of mortal Life  Beset with Dangers and maintain'd with Strife  A Life which all our Care can never save  Our Fate attends us and one common Grave  Besides we tread but a perpetual round  We ne'er strike out but beat the former Ground  And the same maukish Joys in the same Track are found  For still we think an absent Blessing best  Which cloys and is no Blessing when possest  A new arising Wish expels it from the Breast▪  The feav'rish Thirst of Life increases still  We call for more and more and never have our Fill▪  Yet know what to Morrow we shall try  What Dregs of Life in the last Draught may lie  Nor by the longest Life we can attain  One moment from the length of Death we gain  For all behind belongs to his Eternal Reign  When once the Fates have cut the mortal Thread  The Man as much to all Intents is dead  Who dies to day and will as long be so  As he who dy'd a thousand Years ago  To the Pious Memory of the

rich and inexhausted Vein  But if thy Praeexisting Soul  Was form'd at first with Myriads more  It did through all the Mighty Poets roul  Who  Greek  or  Latin  Laurels wore  And was that  Sappho  last which once it was before▪  If so then cease thy flight O  Heavenborn Mind  Thou hast no  Dross  to purge from thy Rich Ore  Nor can thy Soul a fairer Mansion find  Than was the  Beauteous  Frame she left behind  Return to fill or mend the Quire of thy Celestial kind  III  May we presume to say that at thy  Birth    New Joy was sprung in  Heav'n  as well as here on  Earth    For sure the milder Planets did combine  On thy  Auspicious  Horoscope to shine  And ev'n the most malicious were in Trine  Thy  BrotherAngels  at thy  Birth  Strung each his Lyre and tun'd it high  That all the People of the Sky  Might know a Poetess was born on Earth  And then if ever mortal Ears  Had heard the Musick of the Spheres  And if no clust'ring Swarn of  Bees  On thy sweet Mouth distill'd their Golden Dew  'Twas that such vulgar Miracles  Heav'n had not leisure to renew  For all the  Blest  Fraternity of Love  Solemniz'd there thy  Birth  and kept thy Holy day above  IV  O Gracious God How far have we  Prophan'd thy Heav'nly Gift of Poesy  Made prostitute and profligate the Muse  Debas'd to each obscene and impious Use  Who Harmony was first ordain'd  Above  For Tongues of  Angels  and for  Hymns  of  Love  O wretched We why were we hurry'd down  This lubrique and adult'rate Age  Nay added fat Pollutions of our own  T' increase the steaming Ordures of the Stage  What can we say t' excuse our  Second Fall    Let this thy  Vestal  Heaven attone for all  Her  Arethusian  Stream remains unsoil'd  Unmixt with Foreign Filth and undefil'd  Her Wit was more than Man her Innocence a Child  V  Art  she had none yet wanted none  For Nature did that Want supply  So rich in Treasures of her Own  She might our boasted  Stores  defy  Such Noble Vigour did her Verse adorn  That it seem'd borrow'd where 'twas only born  Her Morals too were in her  Bosom  bred  By great Examples daily fed  What in the best of  Books  her Father's Life she read  And to be read her self she need not fear  Each Test and ev'ry Light her Muse will bear  Though  Epictetus  with his Lamp was there  Ev'n Love for Love sometimes her Muse exprest  Was but a  Lambentflame  which play'd about her  Breast  Light as the Vapours of a Morning Dream  So cold her self whilst she such Warmth exprest  'Twas  Cupid  bathing in  Diana  's Stream  VI  Born to the spacious Empire of the  Nine    One wou'd have thought she shou'd have been content  To manage well that mighty Government  But what can young ambitious Souls confine  To the next Realm she stretcht her Sway  For  Painture  near adjoyning lay  A plenteous Province and alluring Prey  A Chamber of Dependencies  was fram'd  As Conquerors will never want pretence  When arm'd to justifie th' Offence  And the whole Fief in right of Poetry she claim'd  The Country open lay without Defence  For Poets frequent Inrodes there had made  And perfectly cou'd represent  The Shape the Face with ev'ry Lineament  And all the large Demains which the  Dumbsister  sway'd  All bow'd beneath her Government  Receiv'd in Triumph wheresoe'er she went  Her Pencil drew what e'er her Sold design'd  And of the  happy Draught  surpass'd the  Image  in her  Mind    The  Sylvan  Scenes of Herds and Flocks  And fruitful Plains and barren Rocks  Of shallow  Brooks  that flow'd so clear  The bottom did the top appear  Of deeper too and ampler Floods  Which as in Mirrors shew'd the Woods  Of lofty Trees with sacred Shades  And Perspectives of pleasant Glades  Where Nymphs of brightest Form appear  And shaggy Satyrs standing near  Which them at once admire and fear  The Ruines too of some Majestick Piece  Boasting the Pow'r of ancient  Rome  or  Greece    Whose Statues Freezes Columns broken lie  And tho' defac'd the Wonder of the Eye  What  Nature Art  bold  Fiction  e'er durst frame  Her forming Hand gave Feature to the Name  So strange a Concourse ne'er was seen before  But when the Peopl'd  Ark  the whole Creation bore  VII  The Scene then chang'd with bold Erected Look  Our Martial King the sight with Reverence strook  For not content t' express his Outward Part  Her Hand call'd out the Image of his Heart  His Warlike Mind his Soul devoid of Fear  His Highdesigning  Thoughts  were figur'd there  As when by Magick Ghosts are made appear  Our Phenix Queen was portray'd too so bright  Beauty  alone cou'd  Beauty  take so right  Her Dress her Shape her matchless Grace  Were all observ'd as well as Heavenly Face  With such a Peerless Majesty she stands  As in that Day she took the Crown from sacred Hands  Before a Train of Heroins was seen  In  Beauty  foremost as in Rank the Queen  Thus nothing to her  Genius  was deny'd  But like a  Ball  of Fire the further thrown  Still with a greater  Blaze  she shone  And her bright Soul broke out on ev'ry side  What next she had design'd Heaven only knows  To such Immod'rate Growth her Conquest rose  That Fate alone its Progress cou'd oppose  VIII  Now all those Charms that blooming Grace  The wellproportion'd Shape and beauteous Face  Shall never more be seen by mortal Eyes  In Earth the much lamented Virgin lies  Not Wit nor Piety cou'd Fate prevent  Nor was the cruel  Destiny  content  To finish all the Murder at a Blow  To sweep at once her  Life  and  Beauty  to  But like a harden'd Felon took a Pride  To work more mischievously slow  And plunder'd first and then destroy'd  O double Sacrilege on things Divine  To rob the Relique and deface the Shrine  But thus  Orinda  dy'd  Heaven by the same Disease did both translate  As equal were their Souls so equal was their Fate  IX  Mean time her  Warlike Brother  on the Seas  His waving Streams to the Winds displays  And vows for his Return with vain Devotion pays  Ah Generous Youth that Wish forbear  The Winds too soon will wast thee here  Slack all thy Sails and fear to come  Alas thou know'st not thou art wreck'd at home  No more shalt thou behold thy Sister's Face  Thou hast already had her last Embrace  But look aloft and if thou ken'st from far  Among the  Pleiad  's a Newkindled Star  If any Sparkles than the rest more bright  'Tis she that shines in that propitious Light  X  When in midAir the Golden Trump shall sound  To raise the Nations under Ground  When in the Valley of  Jehosaphat    The Judging God shall close the Book of Fate  And there the last  Assizes  keep  For those who Wake and those who Sleep  When ratling  Bones  together fly  From the four Corners of the Sky  When Sinews o'er the Skeletons are spread  Those cloath'd with Flesh and Life inspires the Dead  The Sacred Poets first shall hear the Sound  And foremost from the Tomb shall bound  For they are cover'd with the lightest Ground  And streight with inborn Vigour on the Wing  Like mounting Larks to the New Morning sing  There  Thou  sweet Saint before the Quire shalt go  As Harbinger of Heaven the Way to show  The way which thou so well hast learnt below  FINIS  ELEONORA A PANEGYRICAL POEM Dedicated the MEMORY Of the Late COUNTESS OF ABINGDON  LONDON  inted and Sold by  H Hills  in  BlackFryars  near the Waterside Price One Penny  To the Right Honourable the EARL of  ABINGDON  c  MY LORD  THE Commands with which You honour'd me some Months ago are now perform'd They had been sooner but betwixt ill Health some Business and many Troubles I was forc'd to deferr them till this time  Ovid  going to this Banishment and Writing from on Shipboard to his Friends excus'd the Faults of his Poetry by his Misfortunes and told them that good Verses never flow but from a serene and compos'd Spirit Wit which is a kind of  Mercury  with Wings fasten'd to his Head and Heels can fly but slowly in a damp Air I therefore chose rather to Obey You late than ill if at least I am capable of writing any thing▪ at any time which is worthy Your Perusal and Your Patronage I cannot say that I have escap'd from a Shipwreck but have only gain'd a Rock by hard swimming where I may pan  a while and gather Breath For the Doctors give me a sad Assurance that my Disease never took its leave of any Man but with a purpose to return However my Lord I have laid hold on the Interval and manag  d the small Stock which Age has left me to the best Advantage in performing this inconsiderable Service to my Lady's Memory We who are Priests of  Apollo  have not the Inspiration when we please but must wait till the God comes rushing on us and invades us with a Fury which we are not able to resist which gives us double Strength while the Fit continues and leaves us languishing and spent at its Departure Let me not seem to b  ast my Lord for I have really felt it on this Occasion and prophecy'd beyond my natural Power Let me add and hope to be believ'd that the Excellency of the Subject contributed much to the Happiness of the Execution And that the weight of thirty Years was taken off me while I was writing I swom with the Tide and the Water under  e was buoyant The Reader will easily observe that I was transported by the Multitude and Variety of my Similitudes which are generally the Product of a luxuriant Fancy and the Wantonness of Wit Had I call'd in my Judgment to my Assistance I had certainly retrench'd many of them But I defend them not let them pass for beautiful Faults amongst the better sort of Criticks For the whole Poem though written in that which they call Heroick Verse  s of the Pind  rick Nature as well in the Thought as the Expression and as such requires the same Grains of Allowance for it It was intended as your Lordship sees in the Title not for an Elegy but a Panegyrick A kind of Apotheosis indeed if a Heathen Word may be applyed to a Christian Use And on all Occasions of Praise if we take the Ancients for our Patterns we are  bound by Prescription to employ the Magnificence of Words and the force of Figures to adorn the Sublimity of Thoughts  Isocrates  amongst the  Grecian  Orators and  Cicero  and the younger  Pliny  amongst the  Romans  have left us their Precedents for our security For I think I need not mention the inimitable  indar  who stretches on these Pinnions out of sight and is carried upward as it were into another World  This at least my Lord I may justly plead that if I have not perform'd so well as I think I have yet I have us'd my best Endeavours to excel my self One Disadvantage I have had which is never to have known or seen my Lady And to draw the Lineaments of her Mind from the Description which I have receiv'd from others is for a Painter to set himself at work without the living Original before him Which the more beautiful it is will be so much the more difficult for him to conceive when he has only a relation give him of such and such Features by an Acquaintance or a Friend without the Nice Touches which give the best Resemblance▪ and make the Graces of the Picture Every Artist is apt enough to flatter himself and I amongst the rest that that their own ocular Observations would have discover'd more Perfections at least others than have been deliver'd to them Though I have receiv  d mine from the best hands that is from Persons who neither want a just Understanding of my Lady's Worth nor a due Veneration for her Memory  Doctor  Donn  the greatest Wit though not the greatest Poet of our Nation acknowledges that he had never seen Mrs  Drury  whom he has made immortal in his admirable Anniversaries I have had the same fortune though I have no succeeded to the same Genius However I have follow  d his Footsteps in the Design of his Panegyrick which was to raise an Emul  tion in the living to Copy out the Example of the dead And therefore it was that I once intended to have call'd this Poem the Pattern And though on a s  cond Consideration I chang'd the Title into the Name of that Illustrious Person yet the Design continues and  Eleonora  is still the Pattern of Charity Devotion and Humility of the best Wife the best Mother and the best of Friends  And now my Lord though I have endeavour'd to answer Your Commands yet I could not  nswer it to the World nor to my Conscience if I gave not Your Lordship my Testimony of being the best Husband now living I say my Testimony only For the Praise of it is given You by Your self They who despise the Rules of Vertue both in their Practice and their Morals will think this a very trivial Commendation But I think i  the p  culiar Happiness of the Countess of  Abingdon  to have been so truly lov'd by you while she was living and so gratef  lly honour'd after she was dead Few there are who have either had or co  'd have such a Loss and yet fewer who carried their Love and Constancy beyond the Grave The exteriours of Mourning▪ a decent Funeral and black Habits are the usual sti  s of Common Husbands and perhaps their  deserve no better than to be mou  d with Hypocrisie▪  and forgot with ease But you have distinguish'd your self from ordinary Lovers by a real and lasting Grief for the Deceas'd And by endeavouring to raise for her the most durable Monument which is that of Verse And so it would have prov'd if the Workman had been equal to the Work and your Choice of the Artificer as happy as your Design Yet▪ as  Phidias  when he had made the Statue of  Minerva  cou'd not forbear to ingrave his own Name as Author of the Piece so give me leave to hope that by subscribing mine to this Poem I may live by the Goddess and transmit my Name to Posterity by the Memory of Hers 'Tis no Flattery to assure Your Lorship that she is remember'd in the present Age by all who have had the Honour of her Conversation and Acquaintance And that I have never been in any Company since the News of her Death was first brought me where they have not ex  ol'  her Virtues and even spoken the same things of her in Prose which I have done in Verse  I therefore think my self oblig'd to thank Your Lordship for the Commission which You have given me How I have acquitted my self of it must be left to the Opinion of the World in spight of any Protestation which I can enter against the present Age as Incompetent or Corrupt Judges For my Comfort they are but  Englishmen  and as such If they Think ill of me to Day they are inconstant enough to Think well of me to Morrow And after all I have not much to thank my Fortune that I was born amongst them The Good of both Sexes are so few▪ in  ngland  that they stand like Exceptions against General Rules And though one of them has deserv'd a greater Commendation than I cou'd give her they have taken care that I shou'd not tire my Pen with frequent Exercise on the like Subjects▪ that Praises like Taxes shou'  be appropri  ted and left almost as Individual as the Person They say my Talent is Satyr if it be so 'tis a fruitful Age and there is an extraordinary Crop to gather But a single Hand is insufficient for such a Harvest They have sown the Dragons Teeth themselves and 'tis but just they shou'd reap each other in Lampoons You my Lord who have the Character of Honour though 'tis not my Happiness to know You may stand  side with the small Remainders of the  English  Nobility truly such and unhurt your selves behold the mad Combat If I have pleas'd you and some few others I have obtain'd my end You see I have disabled my self like an Elected Speaker of the House yet like him I have undertaken the Charge and find the Burden sufficiently recompenc'd by the Honour Be pleas'd to accept of these my unworthy Labours this Paper Monument and let her Pious Memory which I am sure is Sacred to You not only Plead the Pardon of my many Faults but gain me your Protection which is ambitiously sought by  MY LORD  Your Lordship's most Obedient Servant  JOHN DRYDEN  ELEONORA A Panegyrical Poem Dedicated to the Memory of the Late Countess of  ABINGDON    The Introduction  AS when some Great and Gracious Monarch dies  Soft Whispers first and mournful Murmurs rise  Among the sad Attendants then the Sound  Soon gathers Voice and spreads the News around  Through Town and Country till the dreadful Blast  Is blown to distant Colonies at last  Who then perhaps were off 'ring Vows in vain  For his long Life and for his happy Reign  So slowly by degrees unwilling Fame  Did Matchless  Eleonora  's Fate proclaim  Till publick as the Loss the News became  The Nation felt it in th' extreamest parts  With Eyes o'erflowing and with bleeding Hearts  Of her Charity  But most the Poor whom daily she supply'd  Beginning to be such but when she dy'd  For whilst she liv'd they slept in Peace by Night  Secure of Bread as of returning Light  And with such firm dependance on the Day  That need grew pamper'd and forgot to pray  So sure the Dole so ready at their Call  They stood prepar'd to see the Manna fall  Such Multitudes she fed she cloath'd she nurst  That she her self might fear her wanting first  Of her five Talents other five she made  Heaven that had largely giv'n was largely paid  And in few Lives in wondrous few we find  A Fortune better fitted to the Mind  Nor did her Alms from Ostentation fall  Or proud desire of Praise the Soul gave all  Unbrib'd it gave or if a Bribe appear  No less than Heaven to heap huge Treasures there▪  Want pass'd for Merit at her open Door  Heaven saw he safely might increase his Poor  And trust their Sustenance with her so well  As not to be at Charge of Miracle  None cou'd be needy whom she saw or knew  All in the Compass of her Sphear she drew  He who cou'd touch her Garment was as sure  As the first Christians of th' Apostle's Cure  The distant heard by Fame her pious Deeds▪  And laid her up for their extremest needs  A future Cordial for a fainting Mind  For what was ne'er refus'd all hop'd to find  Each in his turn The Rich might freely come  As to a Friend but to the Poor 'twas Home  As to some Holy House th' Afflicted came  The Hungerstarv'd the Naked and the Lam    Want and Diseases fled before her Name  For Zeal like hers her Servants were too slow  She was the first where need requir'd to go  Her self the Foundress and Attendant too  Sure she had Guests sometimes to entertain  Guests in Disguise of her Great Master's Train  Her Lord himself might come for ought we know  Since in a Servant's Form he liv'd below▪  Beneath her Roof he might be pleas'd to stay  Or some benighted Angel in his way  Might ease his Wings and seeing Heav'n appear  In its best Work of Mercy think it there  Where all the Deeds of Charity and Love  Were in as constant Method as above  All carry'd on all of a piece with theirs  As free her Alms as diligent her Cares  As loud her Praises and as warm her Pray'rs  Of her prudent Management  Yet was she not profuse but fear'd to wast  And wisely manag'd that the stock might last  That all might be supply'd and she not grieve  When Crouds appear'd she had not to relieve  Which to prevent she still increas'd her store  Laid up and spar'd that she might give the more  So  Pharaoh  or some Greater King than he  Provided for the seventh Necessity  Taught from above his Magazines to frame  That Famine was prevented e're it came  Thus Heaven though Allsufficient shows a thrift  In his Oeconomy and bounds his Gift  Creating for our Day one single Light  And his Reflection too supplies the Night  Perhaps a thousand other Worlds that lye  Remote from us and latent in the Sky  Are lighten'd by his Beams and kindly nurst  Of which our Earthly Dunghil is the worst  Now as all Virtues keep the middle Line  Yet somewhat more to one Extreme incline  Such was her Soul abhorring Avarice  Bounteous but almost bounteous to a Vice  Had she giv'n more it had Profusion been  And turn'd th' Excess of Goodness into Sin  Of her Humility  These Vertues rais'd her Fabrick to the Sky▪  For that which is next Heav'n is Charity  But as high Turrets for their Airy steep  Require Foundations in proportion deep  And lofty Cedars as far upward shoot  As to the neather Heavens they drive the Root▪  So low did her secure Foundation lye  She was not Humble but Humility  Scarcely she knew that she was great or fair  Or wise beyond what other Women are  Or which is better knew but never durst compare  For to be conscious of what all admire  And not be vain advances Vertue high'r  But still she found or rather thought she found  Her own worth wanting others to abound  Ascrib'd above their due to ev'ry one  Unjust and scanty to her self alone  Of her Piety  Such her Devotion was as might give Rules  Of Speculation to disputing Schools  And teach us equally the Scales to hold  Betwixt the two Extreams of hot and cold  That pious heat may mod'rately prevail  And we be warn'd but not be scorch'd with Zeal  Business might shorten not disturb her Pray'r  Heaven had the best if not the greater share  An active Life long Oraison  forbids  Yet still she pray'd for still she pray'd by Deeds▪  Her ev'ry day was Sabbath Only free  From hours of Pray'r for hours of Charity  Such as the Jews from servile Toil releast  Where Works of Mercy were a part of Rest  uch as blest Angels exercise above  ary'd with Sacred Hymns and Acts of Love  uch Sabbaths as that one she now enjoys  v'n that perpetual one which she employs  For such Vicissitudes in Heav'n there are  Praise alternate and alternate Pray'r  ll this she practis'd here that when she sprung  midst the Quires at the first sight she sung  ung and was sung her self in Angels Lays  or praising her they did her Maker praise  All Offices of Heav'n so well she knew  Before she came that nothing there was new  And she was so familiarly receiv'd  As one returning not as one arriv'd  Of her various Vertues  Muse down again precipitate thy Flight  For how can Mortal Eyes sustain Immortal Light▪  But as the Sun in Water we can bear  Yet not the Sun but his Reflection there  So let us view her here in what she was  And take her Image in this watry Glass  Yet look not ev'ry Lineament to see  Some will be cast in Shades and some will be  So lamely drawn you scarcely know 'tis she  For where such various Vertues we recite  'Tis like the MilkyWay all over bright  But sown so thick with Stars 'tis undistinguish'd Light  Her Vertue not her Vertues let us call  For one Heroick comprehends 'em all  One as a Constellation is but one  Though 'tis a Train of Stars that rolling on  Rise in their turn and int he Zodiack run  Evern in Motion now 'tis Faith ascends  Now Hope now Charity that upward tends  And downwards with diffusive Good descends  As in Perfumes compos'd with Art and Cost  'Tis hard to say what Scent is uppermost  Nor this part Musk or Civet can we call  Or Amber but a rich Result of all  So she was all a sweet whose ev'ry part  In due proportion mix'd proclaim'd the Maker's Art  No single Vertue we cou'd most commend  Whether the Wife the Mother or the Friend  For she was all in that supreme degree  That as no one prevail'd so all was she  The sev'ral parts lay hidden in the Piece  Th' Occasion but exerted that or this  Of her Conjugal Vertues▪  A Wife as tender and as true withal  s the first Woman was before her Fall  ade for the Man of whom she was a part  ade to attract his Eyes and keep his Heart

Chosen found the pearly Grain  As much as ev'ry Vessel cou'd contain  As in the Blissful Vision each shall share  AS much of Glory as his Soul can bear  So did she love and so dispense her Care  Her eldest thus by consequence was best  As longer cultivated than the rest  The Babe had all that Infant Care beguiles  And early knew his Mother in her Smiles  But when dilated Organs let in Day  To the young Soul and gave it room to play  At his first aptness the Maternal Love  Those Rudiments of Reason did improve  The tender Age was pliant to command  Like Wax it yielded to the forming hand  True to th' Artificer the labour'd Mind  With ease was pious generous just and kind  Soft for Impression from the first prepar'd  Till Vertue with long Exercise grew hard  With ev'ry Act confirm'd and made at last  So durable as not to be effac'd  It turn'd to Habit and from Vices free  Goodness resolv'd into Necessity  Thus fix'd she Vertue's Image that's her own  Till the whole Mother in the Children shone  For that was their Perfection she was such  They never cou'd express her Mind too much  So unexhausted her Perfections were  That for more Children she had more to spare▪  For Souls unborn whom

O  b as truly round  As when in Glory through the publick place  e Spoils of conquer'd Nations were to pass  And but one day for Triumph was allow'd  The Consul was constrain'd his Pomp to croud  And so the swift Procession hurry'd on  That all though not distinctly might be shown▪  So in the straiten'd Bounds of Life confin'd  She gave but Glimpses of her glorious Mind  And Multitudes of Vertues pass'd along  Each pressing foremost in the mighty Throng  Ambitious to be seen and then make room  For greater Multitudes that were to come  Yet unemploy'd no Minute slipt away  Moment were precious in so short a stay  The haste of Heav'n to have her was so great  That some were single Acts though each compleat  But ev'ry Act stood ready to repeat  Her Fellow Saints with busie Care will look  For her blest Name in Fate's Eternal Book  And pleas'd to be outdone with Joy will see  Numberless Vertues endless Charity  But more will wonder at so short an Age  To find a Blank beyond the thirti'th Page  And with a pious Fear begin to doubt  The Piece imperfect and the rest torn out  She died in her Thirty third Year  But 'twas her Saviour's time and cou'd there be  A Copy near th' Original 'twas she  As precious Gums are not for lasting Fire  They but perfume the Temple and expire  So soon was she exhal'd and vanish'd hence▪  A short sweet Odour of a vast Expence  She vanish'd we can scarcely say she dy'd  For but a Now did Heaven and Earth divide  She pass'd serenely with a single B  eath  This Moment perfect Health the next was Death▪  The manner of her D  One Sigh did her Eternal Bliss assure  So little Penance needs when Souls are almost pure  As gentle Dreams our waking Thoughts pursue  Or one Dream pass'd we slide into a new  So close they follow such wild Order keep  We think our selves awake and are asleep  So softly Death succeeded Life in her  She did but dream of Heav'n and was there  No Pains she suffer'd nor expir'd with Noise  Her Soul was whisper'd out with God's still Voice  As an old Friend is beckon'd to a Feast  And treated like a long familiar Guest  He took her as he found but found her so  Her Preparedness to dye  As one in hourly Readiness to go  Ev'n on that Day in all her Trim prepar'd  As early notice she from Heav'n had heard  And some descending Courtier from above  Hav giv'n her timely warning to remove  Or counsel'd her to dress the Nuptial Room  For on that Night the Bridegroom was to come  She dy  d on  Whitsunday  Night  He kept his Hour and found her where she lay  Cloath'd all in white the Liv'ry of the Day▪  Scarce had she sinn'd in Thought or Word or act  Unless Omissions were to pass for Fact  That hardly Death a Consequence cou'd draw  To make her liable to Nature's Law  And that she dy'd we only have to show  The mortal part of her she left below  The rest so smooth so sudenly she went  Look'd like Translation through the Firmament  O  like the fiery Carr on the third Errand sent  Apostrophe her Soul  O happy Soul if thou canst view from high▪  Where thou art all Intelligence all Eye  If looking up to God or down to us  Thou find'st that any way be pervious  Survey the Ruines of thy House and see  Thy widow'd and thy Orphan Family  Look on thy tender Pledges left behind  And if thou canst a vacant Minute find  From Heavenly Joys that Interval afford  To thy sad Children and thy mourning Lord  See how thy grieve mistaken in their Love  And shed a Beam of Comfort from above  Give 'em as much as mortal Eyes can bear  A transieth View of thy full Glories there  That they with mod'rate Sorrow may sustain  And mollifie their Losses in thy Gain  Or else divide the Grief for such thou wert  That shou'd not all Relations bear a part  It were enough to break a single Heart  Epiphonema▪ Or Close of the Poem  Let this suffice Nor thou great Saint refuse  This humble Tribute of no vulgar Muse  Who not by Cares or Wants or Age deprest  Stems a wild Deluge with a dauntless Breast  And dares to sing thy Praises in a Clime  Where Vice Triumphs and Vertue is a Crime  Where ev'n to draw the Picture of thy Mind  Is Satyr on the most of Humane Kind  Take it while yet 'tis Praise before my Rage  Unsafely just break loose on this bad Age  So bad that thou thy self had'st no Defence  From Vice but barely by departing hence  Be what and where thou art To wish thy place  Were in the best Presumption more than Grace  Thy Reliques such thy Works of Mercy are  Have in this Poem been my holy Care  As Earth thy Body keeps thy Soul the Sky  So shall this Verse preserve thy Memory  For thou shalt make it live because it sings of thee  FINIS  The Rambling FuddleCaps OR A TavernStruggle FOR A KISS By the Author of HUDIBRASS REDIVIVUS  LONDON Printed and Sold by  H Hills  in  Blackfryars  near the Waterside  The Rambling FuddleCaps OR A TavernStruggle FOR A KISS  THo' Fuddl'd o'er Night the next Morning we found  That Sleep had recover'd what Claret had drown'd  And all our numb'd Members so feeble and weak  That we scarcely were able to walk or to speak  Were now by kind  Morpheus  with Strength reimpower'd  And all to their primitive Vigour restor'd  Our Thoughts were so sprightly our Humours so gay  That we both were as brisk as a Milkmaid in  May    And as for the Rudders that steer our Affections  As Fancy that Pilot shall give 'em Directions  Which were made over Night so incapably tender  Were now grown as stiff as a Bullock's Defender  That wanting Discretion I'd like to 've miscarry'd  And thoughtless of Cuckldom wish my self marry'd  Well knowing desire of unchaste Copulation  Had been an Affront to our new Reformation  And therefore resolv'd to forbear the sweet Evil  Tho' hugely inclin'd to the Flesh and the Devil  But yet notwithstanding our overNight's Fuddle  That made us so brisk in the Tail and the Noddle  We both were as dry I may justly maintain  As a Rat that is poyson'd by eating his Bane  In order to quench our immod'rate Droughts  That burnt in our Stomachs and scorch'd up our Mouths▪  We leap'd out of Bed with a strong  Appetitus    To swallow a Hair of the Dog that had bit us  We shifted our Linen and whip'd on our Cloaths  And powder'd our Wigs like a couple of  Beaus    Then quitted our Lodging till Night with design  To quench with that Engine a Flask full of Wine  The Fire which God  Bacchus  as well as Fair  Venus    By th' help of brisk Claret had kindl'd within us  So frensical Wretches their Senses restore  By clawing the Hag who bewitch'd 'em before  And skilful Physicians their Patients recover  Of one Dose of Poyson by th' pow'r of another  With this Resolution we cross'd to  SLane    'Twixt which and  BY  hangs a Bush and a Sign  Which some call the  Tuns  by whose size one wou'd guess  They were three Brandy Runlets of Gallons a piece  Well well says my Friend you may descant upon 'em  And for their diminutive sizes untun 'em  But when within Doors you may think 'em much wider  And Judge by the Wine they are Hogsheads of Cider  However said I let us once venture in  If it be for no cause but to see and be seen  For tho' it proves Cider 'twill quench us and clean us  And wash down those sooty remains that are in us  Condens'd from the Poyson of  Necotianus    With that we went into a pretty long Entry  At th' end of which Passage a Female stood Centry  As stiff in her Box and as starch'd in her Dress  As an old AbbyFigure of Wax in a Press  Where any for Threepence may behold  What stiff body'd Queens liv'd in Ages of old  To say that she Paints it might justly provoke her  I'm sure that she does not except 'tis with Oker  Nor did she look warm'd with Canary or Brandy  But just of the Colour of brown Sugarcandy  From whence we may say without any Reflection  She's blest with a sweet and a melting Complexion  Her Bubb  es which just peep'd above to invite ye  By th' help of her S  ays look'd so round and so pretty  That had but her Skin been a little more fair  Like a Stone Horse enrag'd I'd leap'd over the Bar  But the Gingerbread Colour she wore in her Cheeks  Was to me as offensive as Garlick or Leeks  For Yellow I hate and I'll tell you for what  'Tis the Mutton Complexion that dies of the Rot  And who'd be so fond of a Kiss or a Touch  With a Lady that looks not as sound as a Roach  Her Hips I confess were so charmingly plump  And between them a Hillock adorning her Rump  That when she turn'd round by a glimpse I could find  All the best of her Beauty was seated behind  Tho' perhaps upon search it wou'd have prov'd but a Cushion  That rais'd up her Ase to the height of the Fashion  After Ogling and Talking and taking a view  As she stood in the Bar like a Jilt in a Pew  The Drawer according to our desire  Shew'd us into the Kitchin for sake of the Fire  For cold was the Wind and impleasant the Weather  Which made us both willing to follow him thither  No sooner we'd enter'd the Cook's Territories  Where commonly either a Slut or a Whore is  ut a swinging  Bellona  we saw at the Dresser  nd a drunken young Rakehell just going to Kiss her  The masculine Jade had the Fork in her Hand  And bid him stand off at the Word of Command  And being a Lass both of Virtue and Value  She cry'd▪  Keep your Gound or by Heavens I'll maul ye    The Spark in his Cups full of Courage and Vigour  In spight of her Threats rally'd on like a Tyger  With his Arm like a Fencer he parry'd her Poker  And running within her did further provoke her  By falling most roughly and rudely upon her  And bobbing his Hand at the Seat of her Honour  But still with such Art she defended her Lips  And now and then gave him such Pinches and Nips  That I would not have born to have purchas'd a Kiss  From the Lips of Queen  Dido  or  Helen  of  Greece    He swore that he would but she vow'd that he should not  He strove but she rustled so hard that he could not  But as they contended thus who should be Master  I'th' the Scuffle there happen'd a scurvy Disaster  A Pudding with Plumbs standing by on a Stool  Ready mix'd for the Bag temper'd up in a Bowl  Unhappily met with a Fall in the Jostle  And between 'em was thrown on the Ground in the bustle  The Cook at this sorrowful sight grew inflam'd  And wish'd her Antagonist rotted and damn'd  The Spark in return to the Quean of the Kitchin  In wonderful Rage went to Cursing and Bitching  But still in a Passion pursuing his Matter  They scuffled about Ankle deep in the Batter  As Soldiers hard set in a Battle do use  To fight 'till the Blood washes over their Shooes  The sturdy Defendant her Pudding beholding  Fell now in good earnest to scratching and scolding  And fought like a Cat when her Passion was stir'd  To see the good Food trod about like a Td  Her Greasiness now all Venom and Gall  Who swore she'd admit of no  Kissing at all    And with that she exerted her Masculine Force  Who was almost as strong a Mare or a Horse  And push'd down the Spark who most decently lay  In the midst of the Pudding that fell in the Fray  With that he arose full of Malice and Spight  To see his black Cloaths painted over with white  And look'd in this pickle without any Lying  Like a piece of fat Tripe dry'd in Batter for Frying  The Curls of his Wig were so pasted and ma  ted  All over so daub'd so beplumb'd and befatted  So Eggy withal that a Man would have sworn  He had just in the Pill'ry been taking a Tu  n  And being  Lent  time that some illnatur'd Creatures  Had pelted the Rogue with their Pancakes and Fritters  Pray Sir says my Friend to th' unfortunate Lover  D  d ever you read the Fam'd History over  Of a dapper diminutive comical Fellow  Much less than a  Barthol'mewFair  Punchanello  Methinks tho' I speak not by way of Derision  As now you appear in that dripping Condition  You look like that little  Tom Thumb  by my Soul  ust waded from out of the great PuddingBowl  nd have brought away Batter enough on your Back  Which if savingly scrap'd from your Cloaths that are black  nd improb'd into Dumplins would make such a Feast  That would tempt you with Patience to swallow the Jest  Pray Sir cries the Spark in his Puddingy Robes  eep your Flirts to your self and your merry dry Bobs  or I value not you or your Jests of a Clout  m good Flesh within tho' I'm Pudding without  nd if you like the Bitchington think you can beat me  s drunk as I am when you've done you shall eat me  ut if you won't Fight let my Follies alone  r I'll Pudding your Jacket as bad as my own  Dear Sir says my Friend in a bantering manner  ope like the Cook you'll not turn Painterstainer  If you do notwithstanding your huffing and prating  The Proof of the Pudding shall be in the eating  But Sir says our Pyecolour'd Sot of a Beau  Why so much upon Pudding I desire to know  What tho' I'm bitterly daub'd with the Batter  Must every Fool take a lick at the Matter  Ca  't a Man tumble down in a Pudding Ads fish  But another must fling it so oft in his Dish  The Cook in a Corner stood fleering and laughing▪  The Spark she had tam'd stagger'd fretting and chaffing  So near to the Fire in a mighty disgust  Till the Pudding was bak'd on his B  ck to a Crust  Beholding the Rattlebrains marry thought I  I have heard of a Puppy put into a Pye  But never yet met with a Story alluding  To such a great Whelp that was bak'd in a Pudding  By this time the Mistress that sat in the Bar  Being told the Misfortune by  Fennick  the Draw'r  Step'd in to enquire out the truth of the Matter  And view with sad Eyes the poor downfallen Batter  Says Madam to  Nell  in a wonderful Passion  You impudent Baggage pray what's the occasion  The Pudding design'd for your Master's own Table  Is thus trod about like a Td in a Stable  O Heavens pray what has this Termagant Blowze  Been a doing to th' Gentleman's Wig and Cloaths  Zounds Madam crys  Nell  I have done him no Hurt  It was all his own Fault he may thank himself for't  For tho' I'm a poor KitchinWench let me tell ye  I will not be tumbled and touz'd by the Belly  Nor sl  bber'd or Kiss'd as a Slut that was ready  To pleasure each Sot like a Nightwalking Lady  I'd have you to know I am Honest tho' Poor  And disd  in to be us'd like a  WaterLane  Whore  With that Madam  ComingSir  cocking her Head  Cry'd Marrycomeup you're a Beautiful Jade  You had need brag so much of your Hypocrites Vertue  A Gentleman's Kiss would have mightily hurt you  You sh  ll be so proud you're so handsome a Piece  So perfum'd with your Sweat and adorn'd with your Grease  That a Gentleman for your Charms must approve you  And if he once smel  s you must certainly love you  Go go you're a Slu  I would have you to know  Nay a S  u  pet to serve any Gentl  man so  As for one silly Kiss to beget so much Strife  And to spoil the best Pudding you've mix'd in your Life  Says  Nell  to her Mistres  I scorn to be tumbl'd  Let those play  he Fool that delight to be Fumbl'd  But you that are marry'd may do as you list  For a Cut of a Cut Loaf can never be mist  Tho' you say I'm a Strumpet remember good  Madam    As bad as I am I was never at  Had'em    Nor ever did I from my Modesty vary  So far as to jumble a Pipe of  Canary    Or ever commit so notorious a Fault  As be catch'd with a Drawer below in the Vault  In marking that Pipe which was best for your turns  On the Head with the scandalous Sign of Horns  Horns Hussy says  Madam  you impudent Quean  Who is't you reflect on what is it you mean  Did ever you hear thro' the course of you  Life  That I ever prov'd worse than a good Wise  Tis amazing to me I'm astonish'd to think  What your Impudence aims at why sure you're in Drink  Or else to your Mistress you never would prate  so base a provoking and saucy a rate  Z  nes  Madam  says  Nell  in a damnable Fury  Won't be th  s s  ub'd and abus'd I assure ye  Altho' I'm a Scrub that is doom'd to a Kitchin  I never was yet catch'd a Whoring or Bitching  Nor am I got drunk as your Ladyship says  Tho' I know she that was to her ugly Disgrace  And was found with a Spark hovering over her Chair  With a Hand on her Breasts and the other elsewhere  With that says the Mistress You illnatur'd Devil  For shame hold your Tongue that implacable Evil  Come mop up the Batter you've trampl'd and stood in  And let me I say have no more of the Pudding  Whose Fault is't crys  Nell  get you into the Bar  Pray what bus'ness have you to come prying in here  For the longer you stay or the more that you talk  You shall fare but the worse so it's better to walk  Well Hussy says  Madam  for once you shall win me  To use the Goodnature and Patience that's in me  Now I see you're enrag'd I will shew a Concession  But rattle you off when you're out of your Passion  Thus  Madam  return'd to her Station the Bar  With a Nettle t'her Breech and a Flea in her Ear  Being glad to withdraw from the Rubs and the Railings  Of  Nell  that was privy to some of her Failings  Said I honest  Nell  you've an excellent Tongue  That according to Phrase is most notably hung  For it sounds like a Bell and goes off with a Twang  But I hope you'll excuse me invincible  Nelly    If I like a Friend take the Freedom to tell ye  You banter too hard on the Brows of your Master  And open those Sores that have need of a Plaister  With that the huge termagant Devil turn'd back  I believe says the Jade you come in for a snack  They are Sparks like your self and not I crys the Blowze  That with Antlers and Buds injure honest Mens Brows  And when they are absent by kissing their Spouses  Make Bridges of many poor Cuckoldly Noses  Thought I it's more Prudence my Tongue to withhold  Or much better to talk to a Post than a Scold  Cause they both to all Reason are deaf as a Drum  Which the S  old will outrattle when the Post will be dumb  Mr  Prim  who with shame to Elegant Beaus  Had for sake of a Kiss so bespatter'd his Cloaths  And made the whole House so confounded uneasy  By slabb'ring a Slut but so ugly and greasy  O'erpower'd with Wine and Nocturnal Upsitting  Fell asleep in a Nook for a Sot very fitting  With a Coat so besmear'd in his amorous Fight  That he look'd like a Magpy half black and half white  And might justly be stil'd for the Badges he wore  The compleatest Jackpudding that we e'er saw before  As thus the young Drunkard was sleeping and snoring  And dreamnig no doubt on't of Drinking or Whoring  chanc'd that his Father with Carbuncle Face  Those glorious effects of the Bottle and Glass  Came in with a Friend for a whet of good Red  Lest his Rubies and Rosy Pimginets should fade  For Flowers we know soon their Colours would lose  f they were not refresh'd with the Rains and the Dews▪  So the Nose of a Sot which with pleasure we stare at  Would fade if not daily replenish'd with Claret  The hearty Old Dad had no sooner came in  And gave order to  Fennick  to draw him his Wine  Turn'd his Nose to the Door and his Arse to the Fire  A Habit true  Englishmen  always acquire  But the sharp fighted Fox round the Kitchin did look  And saw Daddy's n'own Son drunk a sleep in a Nook  With that he advances up close to the place  Turns his Wig a one side stares his Son in the Face  Catches hold of his Nose in a damnable Passion  And pulling on't breaks into this Exclamation  A Beau to the Life a fine Spark by my Soul  You drunken young Rakehell come out of your hole  Let us see in the Light what a Figure you make  A most exquisite Sot a true Orthodox Rake  A hopeful young Student a rare Inns of Courtier  Nouns what has the Dog been a treading of Mortar  Adsheart now I look on his Wig and his Back  He's all cover'd with Plumbs like an  Islington  Cake  I'll be hang'd if the Whelp had not Pudding for Supper  And eat till he spew'd from his Head to his Crupper  The Son very drunk also equally drowsy  First shrug'd up his Shoulders as if he were Lousy  Then stagg'ring about betwixt sleeping and waking  B'ing ready to spew I suppose by his kecking  Not knowing his Father he damn'd him and swore  He that took him by th' Nose was a Son of a Whore  Then Cursing and Raving like one in Distraction  He vow'd for th' Affront he would have Satisfaction  You Dog  says his Daddy at every word  D' you offer to lay your vile Hand on your Sword  Thou villainous Rebel you undutiful Sot you  D' you lift up your Arm against him that begot you  Sure never poor Mortal e'er father'd before  Such a Rakebelly Rogue of a Son of a Whore  With that the young Prodigal hearing the Name  Of a Father began to be little more tame  And looking about him at last had the Grace  To know 'twas his Dad by his Carbuncle Face  Then after a Keck and a Hickcough or two  Like a Sot overcharg'd that was going to spew  He crys to his Father provoking our Smiles  You're the old Turky  c  ck by your fiery Gills  ut what need you Cobble so loud at a Body  Tavern sometimes is as good as a Study  ve heard you oft say That Conversing and Drinking  Must quicken our Brains more than Reading and Thinking  And that Lawyers  Littleton Bracton  and  Cook  Did agree it was good for a Student to look  n the brisk merry Bottle as well as the Book  'Tis true the said the Father I always allow'd ye  To chear up your Heart with a Glass after Study  But not stretch your Guts like a Porter or Carman  And turn a worse Sot than those guzling Vermin  Pray Gentlemen see but his Coat and his Wig here  Did ever a Beau make so beastly a Figure  He looks by my Soul from the Head to the Rump  ke a Pickpocket just run away from the Pump  You Rogue had I thought you'd have prov'd such an Idle  Young Dog I'd have choak'd you with Pap in the Cradle  And never have been at the chargeable keeping  Of such a rude Rascal that daily is heaping  Such Cares and Vexations upon my Gray Hairs  That in sight of you all makes me burst into Tears  For shame says his Friend do not shew your self such  n old Tony to cry you unman your self much  Tis time to be shedding of Tears when you find him  Ty'd fast in a Cart with the Horses behind him  Have I says the Father sate early and late  ike a Drudge at my Desk to acquire an Estate  And all for the sake of a profligate So    That will spend it much faster then ever 'twas got  But Nouns if the Rakehell continues thus loose  Revenge I'll not leave the young Rebel a Sous  y my Generous Living I'll give him the Goby  nd spend what I meant for the Prodigal Booby  Here Drawer says Rake bring my Father a Quart  I'll be hang'd if 'twill do the old Toast any hurt  Be nimble you Dog draw it brisk neat and fine  For a Glass of true Claret or any good Wine  He loves in a Morning I've oft heard him say  Nay at Night or indeed any time of the Day  My Grandsire I've heard always drank like a Fish  And his Children all lov'd to about with the Dish  So what's bred in the Bone will ne'er out of the Flesh  Therefore why shou'd not I love a Cup of the Creature  As well as my Father by Instinct of Nature  Pray judge crys the Dad do ye think I'm not blest  With a hopeful young Bird but just flown from the Nest  Who is ready to see e'er he's well knit together  To pick out the Eyes of his tender old Father  However you Drawer here bring us a Quart  Since my dutiful Son's so importunate for't  I'm resolv'd for this once will I humour the Brat  'Cause I'll see what the Reprobate Rogue would be at  With that the Old Gentleman sat himself down  And requested the like of his Friend and his Son  The Quart was brought in and the Glass fill'd around  As the Wine went about Daddy's Passion was drown'd  'Till his Fatherly Love prevail'd above Anger  It made him unable to vex any longer  His Rubies now look'd of so noble a Red  Like the Bunches of Grapes round a  Bacchus  's Head  That by squeezing his Nose one wou'd easily have thought  The good Juice must have flown again into the Pot  Ah  Dick says the Dad to his Prodigal Son    If it was not for me what a Race wou'dst thou run  Yet for all my Reproof my Advice and my Care  You're a wicked young Rascal you know that you are▪  However in time thou wilt surely recant  will once more forgive thee whatever comes on't  So  Dick  here's a Bumper of Pacification  Most heartily wish  ng thy new Reformation  For Drinking thou know'st is a very sad Evil  And Whoring and Gaming the Flesh and the Devil  Abandon my Boy all such things that have hurt in  Or else for these Sins thou'lt be damn'd of a certain  Says  Dick  to his Father how cou'd you suppose  When you got your poor Son with that Clarety Nose  But that he must love by the dint of each Ruby  The Bottle when wean'd from its Likeness the Bubby  My Father and Mother have always lov'd Claret  And hew do you think that the Son shou'd forbear it  Whose Blood I might venture to swear without sinning  Was but Claret refin'd at the very beginning  Says Daddy did ever Man hear such a Dog  uch a witty young Cub such a bantering Rogue  uch a pleasant and merry Companion who rather  Than stifle a Jest will make one of his Father  Ah  Dick  if thy Wit was but balanc'd with Grace  Thou for certain wou'dst ne'er let it fly in my Face  But howe'er since the Bottle has got the ascendant  or once I'll forgive thee and so there's an end on't  n hopes when you're sober you Manners will mend on't  O Father says  Dick  could you taste the delights  That my self and Companions enjoy a Nights  Were you once but to hear the Cunnundrums and Quibbles  The Retorts and the Puns the Lampoons and the Libels  The Rhimes Repetitions the Songs and the Catches  The Whims and the Flirts and the smart witty Touches  That over the Flask we most lovingly vent  ou wou'd think a whole Night most gloriously spent  nd wou'd guess by our Wit and the course that we follow  We cou'd all be no less than the Sons of  Apollo    Ah  Dick  says the Father take care I entreat ye  Thou'dst better be hang'd of the two than be witty  For if thou'rt once thought by the Studies and Labours  To've acquir'd more Wit than the rest of thy Neighbours  Thou'lt be piss'd on by Fools and be fear'd by thy Betters  And hunted about by Whores Bayliffs and Setters  Thy Lodging must be in some Ninepenny Garret  Thy Drink Porters Guzzle much oftner than Claret  Thy Coat must through all the four Seasons be worn  Till it's robb'd of its Nap like a Sheep newly shorn  You must always seem pleasant that is if you can  Keep your Wits ready prim'd for a flash in the Pan  When your Pockets are empty your Brains must project  Puns Quibbles and Tales to supply the Defect  That whenever you meet with a generous Chub  You may sneak out a Jest in the room of your Club  For a Wit is no more than a merry  Tom  Fool  A satyrical Scourger or flattering Tool  The Son of Nine Whores that's compell'd by his

sigh all Day and wish all Night  For her my only Object of Delight  What must I marry No I'll not be cloy'd  The B  it I'll nibble but the Hook avoid  For cold Restraint makes every thing seem worse  And often turns our Blessings to a Curse  I love my Bed when I my Rest would take  Must it be therefore corded to my Back  If I delight my Gelding to bestride  Must I be always to the Saddle ty'd  What th  I chiefly love one sort of Meat  'Tis Punishment to've nothing else to eat  The Charming Sex I'cknowledge I adore  And value Beauty much but Freedom more  If the kind Nymph will yield to my Desires  And w  th her Fa  ours quench Loves pleasing Fires  I'll not with Oaths and Vows her Faith deceive  But prove as kind as Nature givers me leave  Be constant too as long as e'er I can  But will not promise to be more than Man  And when I'm tir'd that she the Truth may know  I'll frankly without Flatt'ry tell her so  Thus would I deal with Love's Rebellious Flame  When cloy'd with one I'd still pursue fresh Game  And not enslave my self or yet deceive the Dame  When one Delight by Use Insipid grew  I'd change the stale Enjoyment for a New  From Am'rous Sports to th' Bottle I'd repair  To fill those Veins I'd empty'd with the Fair  Drink till my W  ts were ripe and Brains were full  For to be sober is but to be dull  Songsters and Wits I'd for Companions chuse  One for their Musick th' other for their Muse  That some kind Voice might readily supply  Our Thoughtful Intervals with Harmony  Thus would we chase Old Father  Time  all Night  Shorten our Days to lengthen our Delight  Drink Healths sing Catches talk of past Intrigues  And strengthen Bottle Friendship with new Leagues  Swallow down Bumpers to each Left hand Friend  And Vow a Thousand things we ne'er intend  When thus well fraighted with the chearful Juice  We'd sally forth and give our selves a loose  Break Broth  l Windows scour the crazy Watch  And with fresh Mischiefs crown the Night's Debauch  But soon as bright  Aurora  should draw nigh  And with her Blushes gild the Eastern Sky  Drowsie and drunk we'd stagger to our Beds  And in Sot's Hev'n compose our aching Heads  There drown in Sleep the Mem'ry of our Sins  And rise refresh'd as  DruryLane  begins  For new Diversions to the PlayHouse fly  Seek out new Faces and their Humours try  Flatter the Coy and ridicule the Free  Tattle with Punks and ogle Quality  Who in their upper Region awful sit  And cull their brawny Stallions from the Pit  Sometimes I'd be attentive to the Stage  The Poet's Princess shou'd my Eyes engage  If she perform'd her Part with Excellence  And trod the Stage with Graceful Impudence  I'd clap the Dowdy till my Arms were sore  As she perhaps had many a Spark before  With Pleasure hear the O'ergrown Poppet whine  And prostrate mourn o'er some dead Lover's Shrine  Laugh in my Sleeve to know the cunning Jade  Kneels down a Wre yet rises for a Maid  Next Scene perhaps some Hero might appear  That liv'd long since the Lord knows when or where  Who in a Raving Fit of Jealous Love  Would curse his angry Stars and threaten  Jove    That the Fair Sex might with Concern behold  How Henpeck'd Monarchs rav'd and lov'd of old  And learn from thence to over Kings prevail  And make the Head subservient to the Tail  Thus on each Scene would I my Judgment spend  Clap when they pleas'd and hiss should they offend  Applaud the Poet when his Lines were full  Commend his Wit but damn his Muse when dull  Keck when I heard the  Barnet  Mimick raise  His croaking Voice in Fam'd  Ben Johnson  's Plays  Blush that full Boxes and a crowded Pit  Should delight more in Apish Whims than Wit  For what dull Miscreant could with Patience see  A Noble Play quite spoil'd with Foolery  And  French  JackPuddings in a thankless Age  Affront Immortal  Shakespear  on the Stage  So Nice Fop Epicures disdain to eat  Without some Foreign Sauce true  English  Meat  And think thro' a Mistake the wholesome Food  Cannot without such pault'ry Stuff be good  When all their illmix'd Rareties at last  Spoil the Regale and but confound the Taste  When for three Hours I'd thus with Pleasure view'd  The strutting Mimicks and their list'ning Crowd  Till a dull Epilogue perhaps new writ  B  some young Upstart Rhimer in the Pit  Should gain a Clap to dignifie his Verse  Fit only to adorn a  Smithfield  Farce  Then to some Brothel would I steer my Course  Where Beauty needs no Flattery or Force  But where a Golden Bribe will purchase Bliss  And open all the Gates of Paradice  Gold whose prevailing Touch we daily see  Will charm the Soul of the most Charming she  Who when the pow'rful  Indian  God's in view  Wil  sacrifice their All to Gold and you  Thus would I conquer who I most admir'd  Triumph o'er Beauty till my Loins were tir'd  Wal  ow in Love and by exerting much  Work out the Dregs of the last Night's Debauch  Re  resh my Limbs by a kind pleasing Sweat  Better than with a Bagnio's painful Heat  Thus should my  Chloe  double Kindness shew  And be both Doxy and my Doctress too  Supple my Joints at once and cool my Flame  And when I'd gratify'd the obliging Dame  I'd leave her to the next Lewd Rake that came  Then I'd repair to Queen  Fortuna  's Court  Where Hawkey'd Bullies and Rich Fools resort  Where Wolves with Lambs and Kites with Chickens play  And Eagles do on Gaudy Peacocks prey  Where many seek but very few can find  The fickle Dame they co  rt continue Kind  Who like a subtle Jilt seems often vex'd  And if she smile  one Minute fro  s the next  There with the fatal Instruments of Chance  Hazard my Store in hopes to more advance  Draw in Rich Bubbles Cog Lie Flatter Cheat  And push at all to be Profusely Great  With eager Hopes Blind Fortune thus pursue  And win from Nobles what's their Tradesmen's Due  But should the fickle Dame her Smiles refuse  I'd damn the sullen Jilt that made me lose  Confound the Tongue that taught me first to Game  And curse th' uncertain Dice that crost my Aim  For each at play this Privilege may take  Winners may smile and Losing Gamesters speak  No sneaking Sum should my Ambition bound  I'd be a  Bch'r  or my All con  ound  Insinuate with my wealthy Lady's Son  Cringe to the Fop and cheat him when I'd done  Drink with young Heirs then draw them in to play  Praise them for Wits and on their Weakness prey  For unexperienc'd Fools we dialy see  Tho' ne'er so stubborn bend to Flattery  Should Hoodwink'd Chance to gratifie my Pride  Thus kindly place me on the winning side  And guide the Dice with her prevailing Hand  Till my extensive Wishes I had obtain'd  Fortune would I adore and only she  For her past Favours should my Goddess be  A Coach and Six I'd to her Glory raise  And o'er the Stones would rattle forth her Praise  Proud of my illgot Wealth with Scorn look ou    And laugh at Honest Fools that walk on Foot  Contented to be poor for Conscience sake  Whilst Libertines by Fraud their Fortunes make  To thee kind Chance that does allot the Prize  Thou partial Goddess of the Cards and Dice  I'd sacrifice from out the Numerous Swarm  Some poor Levantine Bully every Term  Till none should dare thy Altars to abuse  And push at all who nothing have to lose  But creep behind and with a Courtly Mein  Turn humble Supplicants to those that win  Then to advance my own immortal Fame  And make distressed Punks adore my Name  I'd build an AlmsHouse for each castoff Whore  And as I'd gull'd the Rich I'd feed the Poor  Bribe  Irish  Stallions with my  English  Gold  To please the Lame Blind Ugly and the Old  That those course Objects we despise might share  What's now engross'd by th' Youthful and the Fair  Thus every Hump and Squinny should enjoy  As much of Love as they could well employ  With new found Acts of Charity like these  Ne'er yet perform'd the Sinful World I'd please  Till ev'ry illshap'd Dowdy shou'd confess  To me alone she own'd her Happiness  And say there goes the Man Gd speed him well  That sav'd our Souls from leading Apes in Hell  Nay Toothless Beldams wrinkl'd and defac'd  Should mumble out their Blessings as I pass'd  And cry all Honour be my Master's due  Who feeds those Mouths that have no Teeth to chew  This would I do tho' by the Saints revil'd  Where I as Rich as  Db  or as  Cd    Like Quality the  Sunday  would I spend  And duly  CoventGarden  Church attend  Religion would I modishly profess  By Seven rise and take three Hours to dress  Then in my Chariot rattle thro' the Street  To Church where Hypocrites in Clusters meet  Amongst the list'ning Crowd I'd squeeze for Room  And with my Snush the Sweaty Air perfume  Till the PewKeeper more for Gain than Grace  Should wedge me into some Commodious Place  Where I the Gaudy Christian Herd might view  And to the Fair my own Deportment shew  I'd pierce the Ladies with an amorous Eye  But all their pious Looks and Cheats defie  Take notice who was Fairest or most Fine  Who had the Blackest Hair or Whitest Skin  What Charming Phubsy had the Loveli'st Breast  Who was the most Devout and pray'd the best  Who had the bri  kest Eye and fullest Brow  Denoting a good Furbulo below  Who had an Awful Look and Modest Grace  And who a Lustful Air and Tempting Face  Thus as an Observator would I sit  Inspect the Galleries first and then the Pit  And from the diff'rent Saints in sundry Pews  At once learn how to Judge and how to Chuse  Perhaps behold some Lewd Notorious Punk  That never prays but when she's Maudlin Drunk  Pluck down her Hoods kneel low amongst the rest  And seem as quaint a Christian as the best  Hold up her sinful Hands respond as loud  As th' upright'st Saint in all the Holy Croud  And when she's done resume her matted place  With Sin and Sorrow blushing in her Face  Yet all pure Art without one spark of Grace  When Pray'r was o'er with Patience would I sit  And hear Old  Sternhold  Rhime to  David  's Wit  But smile to see the Clark his Looks compose  And saddle with his Spectacles his Nose  Then coughing spit and when his Lungs were calm  Turn to his Book and snuffle out a Psalm  Wherein each Zealot fond of singing Praise  Might squeak their Ekes and grumble out their Ayes  Over the doleful Song I'd yawn and gape  What Christian could resolve against a Nap  Or who forbear to dose at every Line  That did not in the drowsie  Chorus  joyn  My Head I'm sure their grave slow Time would keep  For whilst they chanted I should nod and sleep  Like Gammer  Friskit  in her Wicker Chair  Lull'd by  Now ponder well you Parents dear    Thus during Pray'rs the painful Hour I'd spend  And small Attention to the Sermon lend  But e'er 'twas well begun still wish it at an End  With Patience I would hear the Preacher throw  His Darts upon the sinful Croud below  Observe his Knack when prettily he talk'd  How well he hem'd how gracefully he haulk'd  How mannerly he did his Nostrils blow  And how he lugg'd the Cushion to and fro  How earnestly sometimes his Words came out  And how he thrash'd the Pope and Dev'l about  When the last Sand of the long Hour had run  And told old  Spintext  when 'twas time to've done  I'd rise among the rest and gaze around  Till I some fam'd Intriguing Lady found  Invited by her Eyes and some kind Smile  As she walk'd out I'd meet her in the Isle  With Am'rous Whispers I'd her Ears approach  Squeeze her soft Hand conduct her to her Coach  And lay the Groundwork of a new Debauch  Then to some Rakish Friends my course I'd steer  Strangers to Faith and Enemies to Fear  There Ridicule with them the Canting Priest  And make Religion but our common Jest  Raise up dead  Hobs  to justifie our Cause  And overthrow Divine by Nature's Laws  Burlesque the Scriptures and asperse the Creed  Aw'd by no musty Rules Love Drink and Feed  This is the happy Life we Modish Rakes would lead  FINIS  A Catalogue of Poems  c  Printed and Sold by  H Hills  in  BlackFryars

Hills  in  BlackFryers  near the Waterside  TO THE KING  SIR  AFter the delivery of Your Royal Father's Person into the hands of the Army I undertaking to the Queen Mother that I would find some means to get access to him she was pleased to send me and by the help of  Hugh Peters  I got my admittance and coming well instructed from the Queen his Majesty having been long kept in the dark he was pleased to discourse very freely with me of the whole state of his Affairs But Sir I will not launch into a History instead of an Epistle One morning waiting on him at  Causham  smiling upon me he said he could tell me some News of my self which was that he had seen some Verses of mine the Evening before being those to Sir  Richard Fanshaw  and asking me when I made them I told him two or three years since he was pleased to say that having never seen them before He was afraid I had written them since my return into  England  and though he liked them well He would advise me to write no more alledging that when men are young and have little else to do they might vent the overflowings of their Fancy that way but when they were thought fit for more serious Employments if they still persisted in that course it would look as if they minded not the way to any better  Whereupon I stood corrected as long as I had the honour to wait upon him and at his departure from  Hampton Court  he was pleased to command me to stay privately at  London  to send to him and receive from him all his Letters from and to all his Correspondents at home and abroad and I was furnish'd with nine several Cyphers in order to it Which trust I performed with great safety to the persons with whom we corresponded but about nine months after being discovered by their knowledge of Mr  Cowley's  Hand I happily escaped both for my self and those that held correspondence with me that time war too hot and busie for such idle speculations but after I had the good fortune to wait upon Your Majesty in  Holland  and  France  You were pleased sometimes to give me Arguments to divert and put off the evil hours of our Banishment which now and then fell not short of Your Majesty's expectation  After when Your Majesty departing from St  Germans  to  Jersy  was pleased freely without my asking to confer upon me that place wherein I have now the honour to serve You I then gave over Poetical Line  and made it my business to draw such others as might be more serviceable to Your Majesty and I hope more la  ing Since that time I never disobeyed my old  aster's Commands till this  ummer at the We  s my Retirement the  te  pting me to divert those melancholy Thoughts which the new Apperit  n  of Foreign Invasion and Domestick Di  content gave us But the  e Clouds being now happily blown over and our Sun clearly shining out again I have recovered the Relapse i  being suspected that it would have proved th  Epidemical Disease of Age which is apt to fall back into the Fo  es in You  h yet  Socrates Aristotle  and  Ca  o  did the same and  Scaliger  saith that  ragment of  Aristotle  was bey  nd any thing that  Pindar  or  Homer  ever wrote I will not call this a Dedication for those Epistles are commonly greater Absurdities than any that come after▪ For what Author c  n reasonably believe th  t fixing the great Name of some eminent Patron in the Forehead of his Book can charm away Censure and that the first Leaf should be a Curtain to draw over and hide all the deformities that stand behind it Neither have I any need  f such sh  f  s for most of the Parts of thi Body have already had your Majesty's View▪ and having past the Test of  cle  sharp sighted a Judgment which has as good a Title to give Law in Matters of this Nature as in any other they wh  shal  presume to dissent from Your Majesty will do more wrong to their own Judgment than their Judgment can do to me And for those latter Parts which have not yet received your Majesty's favourable Aspect if they who ha  e se  n them do not fl  tter me for I dare not trust my own Judgment they will make it appear that it is not with me as with most of Mankind who never forsake their Darling Vices till their Vices forsake them and that this Divorce was not  Frigiditatis causâ  but an Act of Choice and not of Necessity Ther  fore Sir I shall only call it an humbl  Petition That Your Majesty will p  ease to pardon this new Amour to my old Mistress and my Disobedience to his Commands▪ to whose Memory I look upon with great Reverence and Devotion and making a seriouus Reflection upon that wise Advice it carries much greater weight with it now than wh  n it was given f  r when Age and Experience has so ripened Man's Discre  ion as to make it fit for use either in private or publick  Affairs nothing blasts and cor  upts the Fruit of it so much as the empty airy Reputation of being  nimis Poeta  and therefore I shall take my leave of the Muses as two of my Predecessors did saying  Splendidis longum vale dico nugis  Hic versus caesera ludiera pono  Your Majesty's most faithful and loyal Subject and most dutiful and devoted Servant JO DENHAM  COOPERSHILL  SURE there are Poets which did never dream  Upon  Parnassus  nor did taste the Stream  Of  Helicon  we therefore may suppose  Those made not Poets but the Poet those  And as Courts make not Kings but Kings the Court  So where the Muses and their Train resort  Parnassus  stands if I can be to thee  A Poet thou  Parnassus  art to me  Nor wonder if advantag'd in my Flight  By taking Wing from thy Auspicious Height  Through untrac'd Ways and airy Paths I fly  More boundless in my Fancy than my Eye  My Eye which swift as Thought contracts the Space  That lies between and first salutes the Place  Crown'd with that sacred Pile so vast so high  That whether 'ts part of Earth or Sky  Uncertain seems and may be thought a proud  Aspiring Mountain or descending Cloud  Paul  's the late Theme of such a Muse whose Flight  M W  His bravely reach'd and soar'd above thy Height  Now shalt thou stand though Sword or Time or Fire  Or Zeal more fierce than they thy Fall conspire  Secure whilst thee the best of Poets sings  Preserv'd from Ruin by the best of Kings  Under his proud survey the City lies  And like a mist beneath a Hill doth rise  Whose state and wealth the business and the Crowd  Seems at this distance but a darker Cloud  And is to him who rightly things esteems  No other in effect than what it seems  Where with like haste tho' several ways they run  Some to undo and some to be undone  While Luxury and Wealth like War and Peace  Are each the others ruine and increase  As Rivers Lost in Seas some secret Vein  Thence reconveys there to be lost again  O happiness of sweet retir'd content  To be at once secure and innocent  Windsor  the next where  Mars  with  Venus  dwells  Windsor  Beauty with strength above the Vally swells  Into my eye and doth it self present  With such an easie and unforc't ascent  That no stupendious precipice denies  Access no horror turns away our eyes  But such a Rise as doth at once invite  A pleasure and a reverence from the sight  Thy mighty Master's Emblem in whose Face  State Meekness heightned with Majestick Grace  Such seems the gentle Height made only proud  To he the Basis of that pompous load  Than which a nobler weight no Mountain bears  But  Atlas  only that supports the Sphears  When Nature's hand this ground did thus advance  'Twas guided by a wiser power than Chance  Mark'd out for such a use as if 'twere meant  T' invite the Builder and his choice prevent  Nor can we call it choice when what we chuse  Folly or Blindness only could refuse  A Crown of such Majestick Tow'rs doth grace  The God's great Mother when her heavenly race  Do homage to her yet she cannot boast  Amongst that numerous and Celestial Host  More  Hero's  than can  Windsor  nor doth Fame's  Immortal Book record more noble Names  Not to look back so far to whom this Isle  Owes the first Glory of so brave a Pile  Whether to  Caesar Albanact  or  Brute    The British  Arthur  or the Danish  Knute    Though this of old no less contest did move  Than when for  Homer  's Birth seven Cities strove  Like him in Birth thou shoul'dst be like in Fame  As thine his Fate if mine had been his Flame  But whosoe'er it was Nature design'd  First a brave place and then as brave a mind  Not to recount those several Kings to whom  It gave a Cradle or to whom a Tomb  But the great  Edward  Third and the  Black Prince    Edward  and thy greater Son  The Lillies which his Father wore he won  And thy  Queen  Philipa    Bellona  who the Consert came  Not only to thy Bed but to thy Fame  The Kings of  France  and  Scotland    She to the Triumph led one Captive King  And brought that Son which did the second bring  Then didst thou found that Order whether Love  Or Victory thy Royal Thoughts did move  Each was a Noble Cause and nothing less  Than the Design has been the great Success  Which Foreign Kings and Emperors esteem  The second Honour to their Diadem  Had thy great Destiny but giv'n the Skill  To know as well as Power to act her Will  That from those Kings who then thy Captives were  In Aftertime should spring a Royal Pair  Who should possess all that thy mighty Power  Or thy Desires more mighty did devour  To whom their better Fate reserves whate'er  The Victor hopes for▪ or the Vanquish'd fear  That Blood which thou and thy Great Gransire shed  And all that since these Sister Nations bled  Had been unspilt had happy Edward known  That all the Blood he spilt had been his own  When he that Patron chose in whom are injoy'd  Souldier and Martyr and his Arm's confin'd  Within the Azure Circle he did seem  But to foretel and prophesie of him  Who to his Realms that Azure Roun hath joyn'd  Which Nature for their Bound at first design'd  That Boun  which to the World's extreamest ends  End  it self  s Liquid Arms extends  Nor doth he need those Emblems which we Paint  But is himself the Souldier and the Saint  Here should my Wonder dwell and here my Praise  But my fixt Thoughts my wandring Eye betrays  Viewing a Neighbouring Hill whose Top of late  A Chappel crown'd till in the common Fate  The adjoyding Abbey fell May no such Storm  Fall on our Times where Ruin must reform  Tell me my Muse what monstrous dire Offence  What Crime could any Christian King incense  To such a Rage Was't Luxury or Lust  Was he so Temperate so Chaste so Just  Were these their Crimes They were his own much more  But Wealth is Crime enough to him that's poor  Who having spent the Treasures of his Crown  Condemns their Luxury to feed his own  And yet this Act to varnish o'er the Shame  Of Sacriledge must bear Devotion's Name  No Crime so bold but would be understood  A real or at least a seeming good  Who fears not to do ill yet fears the Name  And free from Conscience is a Slave to Fame  Thus he the Church at once protects and spoils  But Princes Swords are sharper than their stiles  And thus to th'Ages past he makes amends  Their Charity destroys their Faith defends  Then did Religion in a lazy Cell  In empty airy Contemplations dwell  And like the Block unmoved lay but ours  As much to active like the Stork devours  Is there no temperate Region can be known  Betwixt their Frigid and our Torrid Zone  Could we not wake from that Lethargick Dream  But to be restless in a worse Extream  And for that Lethargy was there no Cure  But to be cast into a Calenture  Can knowledge have no bound but must advance  So far to make us wish for ignorance  And rather in the dark to grope our way  Than led by a false Guide to erre by day  Who sees these dismal Heaps but would demand  What barbarous Invader sack'd the Land  But when he hears no Goth no Turk did bring  This desolation but a Christian King  When nothing but the Name of Zeal appears  'Twixt our best actions and the worst of theirs  What does he think our Sacrilege would spare  When such th' effects of our Devotion are  Parting from thence 'twixt anger shame and fear  Those for what's past and this for what's too near  My eye descending from the Hill surveys  Where  Thames  amongst the wanton Vallies strays  Thames  the most lov'd of all the Ocean Sons  Thames  By his old Sire to his embraces runs  Hasting to pay his tribute to the Sea  Like mortal life to meet Eternity  Though with those streams he no resemblance hold  Whose foam is Amber and their Gravel Gold  His genuine and less guilty wealth t' explore  Search not his bottom but survey his shore  O're which he kindly spreads his spacious wing  And hatches plenty for th' ensuing Spring  Nor then destroys it with too fond a stay  Like Mothers which their Infants overlay  Nor with a sudden and impetuous wave  Like profuse Kings resums the wealth he gave  No unexpected inundations spoil  The Mowers hopes nor mock the Plowmans toyl  But Godlike his unwearied Bounty flows  First loves to do than loves the Good he does  Nor are his Blessings to his banks confin'd  But free and common as the Sea or Wind  When he to boast or to disperse his stores  Full of the tributes of his grateful shores  Visits the World and in his flying towers  Brings home to us and makes both  Indies  ours  Finds wealth where 'tis bestows it where it wants  Cities in desarts Woods in Cities plants  So that to us no thing no place is strange  While his fair bosom is the World's exchange  O could I flow like thee and make thy stream  My great example as it is my theme  Though deep yet clear though gentle yet not dull  Strong without rage without o'reflowing full  Heaven her  Eridanus  no more shall boast  Whose Fame in thine like lesser Currents lost  Thy nobler Streams shall visit  Jove  's Aboads  To shine among the Stars and bathe the Gods  Here Nature  The Forrest  whether more intent to please  Us or her self with strange Varieties  For Things of Wonder give no less Delight  To the wise Makers than Beholder's Sight  Though these Delights from several Causes wove  For so our Children thus our Friends we love  Wisely she knew the Harmony of Things  As well as that of Sounds from Discords springs  Such was the Discord which did first disperse  Form Order Beauty through the Universe  While Driness Moisture Coldness Heat resists  All that we have and that we have subsists  While the steep horrid Roughness of the Wood  Strive with the gentle Calmness of the Flood  Such huge Extreams when Nature doth unite  Wonder from thence results from thence Delight  The Stream is so transparent pure and clear  Narcissus  That had the selfenamour'd Youth gaz'd here  So fatally deceiv'd he had not been  While he the Bottom not his Face had seen  But his proud Head the airy Mountain hides  Among the Clouds his Shoulders and his Sides  A shady Mantle clothes his curled Brows  Frown on the gentle Stream which calmly flows  While Winds and Storms his lofty Forehead beat  The common Fate of all that's High or Great  Low at his Foot a spacious Plain is plac'd  Between the Mountain and the Stream embrac'd  Which Shade and Shelter from the Hill derives  While the kind River Wealth and Beauty gives  And in the mixture of all these appears  Variety which all the rest indears  This Scene had some bold  Greek  or  British  Bard  eheld of old what Stories had we heard  Of Fairies Satyrs and the Nymphs their Dames  Their Feasts their Revels and their Amorous Flames  Tis still the same altho' their airy Shape  All but a quick Poetick Sight escape  There  Faunus  and  Silvanus  keep their Courts  nd thither all the horned Hoast resorts  To graze the ranker Mead that noble Heard  On whose sublime and shady Fronts is rear'd  Nature's great MasterPiece to shew how soon  Great things are made but sooner are undone  Here have I seen the King when great Affairs  ave leave to slacken and unbend his Cares  ttended to the Chase by all the Flower  Of Youth whose Hopes a nobler Prey devour  leasure with Praise and Danger they would buy  nd wish a Foe that would not only fly  The Stag now conscious of his fatal Growth  t once indulgent to his Fear and Sloth  To some dark Covert his Retreat had made  Where no Man's Eye nor Heaven's should invade  's soft Repose when th' unexpected Sound  f Dogs and Men his wakeful Ear doth wound  ouz'd with the Noise he scarce believes his Ear  illing to think th' Illusions of his Fear  given this false Alarm but strait his View  onfirms that more than all he fears is true  Betray'd in all his Strengths the Wood beset  All Instruments all Arts of Ruine met  He calls to mind his Strength and then his Speed  His winged Heels and then his Armed Head  With these t' avoid with that his Fate to meet  But fear prevails and bids him trust his Feet  So fast he flies that his reviewing eye  Has lost the Chasers and his ear the Cry  Exulting till he finds their Nobler Sense  Their disproportion'd Speed does recompense  Then curses his conspiring Feet who scent  Betrays that safety which their swiftness lent  Then tries his Friends among the baser heard  Where he so lately was obey'd and fear'd  His safety seeks the Herd unkindly wise  Or Chases him from thence or from him flies  Like a declining Statesman left forlorn  To his Friends pity and Pursuers scorn  With shame remembers while himself was one  Of the same Herd himself the same had done  Thence to the Coverts and the conscious Groves  The Scenes of his past Triumphs and his Loves  Sadly surveying where he rang'd alone  Prince of the Soil and all the Herd his own  And like a bold Knight Errant did proclaim  Combat to all and bore away the Dame  And taught the Woods to Echo to the Stream  His dreadful Challenge and his clashing Beam  Yet fairly now declines the fatal strife  So much his Love was dearer than his Life  Now every Leaf and every moving Breath  Presents a Foe and every Foe a Death  Wearied forsaken and pursu'd at last  All safety in despair of safety plac'd  Courage he thence resumes resolv'd to bear  All their Assaults since 'tis in vain to fear  And now too late he wishes for the fight  That strength he wasted in ignoble flight  But when he sees the eager Chase renew'd  Himself by Dogs the Dogs by Men pursu'd  He strait revokes his bold resolve and more  Repents his courage than his fear before  Finds that uncertain ways unsafest are  And Doubt a greater mischief than Despair  Then to the Stream when neither Friends nor Force  Nor speed nor Art avail he shaps his course  Thinks not their rage so desperate t' assay  An Element more merciless than they  But fearless they pursue nor can the Flood  Quench their dire Thirst alas they thirst for Blood  So toward a Ship the oarefin'd Gallies ply  Which wanting Sea to ride or Wind to fly  Stands but to fall reveng'd on those that dare  Tempt the last fury of extream Despair  So fares the Stag among the enrag'd Hounds  Repels their force and wounds returns for wounds  And as a Hero whom his baser Foes  In Troops surrounds now these assails now those  Though Prodigal of Life disdains to dye  By common hands but if he can descry  Some nobler Foes approach to him he calls  And begs his Fate and then contented falls  So when the King a mortal Shaft lets flye  From his unerring hand then glad to dye  Proud of the wound to it resigns his Blood  And stains the Crystal with a purple Flood  This a more innocent and happy Chase  Than when of old but in the selfsame place  Runny Mead where that Great Charter was first sealed  Fair Liberty pursu'd and meant a Prey  To lawless power here turn'd and stood at Bay  When in that Remedy all hope was plac'd  Which was or should have been at least the last  Here was that Charter seal'd wherein the  Magna Charta  Crown  All marks of Arbitrary Power lays down  Tyrant and Slave those Names of hate and fear  The happier Style of King and Subject bear  Happy when both to the same Center move  When Kings give Liberty and Subjects Love  Therefore not long in Force this Charter stood  Wanting that Seal it must be seal'd in Blood  The Subjects arm'd the more their Princes gave  Th' advantage only took the more to crave  Till King's by giving gave themselves away  And even that Power that should deny betray  "Who gives constrain'd but his own Fear reviles  "Not thank'd but scorn'd nor are thy Gifts but Spoils  Thus Kings by grasping more than they could hold  First made their Subjects by Oppression bold  And popular Sway by forcing Kings to give  More than was fit for Subjects to receive  Ran to the same Extreams and one Excess  Made both by striving to be greater less  When a calm River rais'd with sudden Rains  Or Snows dissolv'd▪ o'erflows the adjoyning Plains  The Husbandmen with highrais'd Banks secure  Their greedy Hopes and this he can endure  But if with Bays and Dams they strive to force  His Chanel to a new or narrow Course  No longer then within his Banks he dwells  First to a Torrent then a Deluge swells  Stronger and Fiercer by Restraint he roars  And knows no Bound but makes his Powers his Shores  FINIS  THE DUEL OF THE STAGS A POEM Written by the Honourable Sir  ROBERT HOWARD  Together with An EPISTLE TO THE AUTHOR By Mr  John Dryden    LONDON Printed and Sold by  H Hills  in  Blackfryars  near the Waterside  THE DUEL of the STAGS  IN  Windsor  Forest before War destroy'd  The harmless Pleasures which soft Peace enjoy'd  mighty Stag grew Monarch of the Herd  y all his Savage Slaves obey'd and fear'd  nd while the Troops about their Sovereign fed  hey watch'd the awful nodding of his Head  till as he passeth by they all remove  roud in Dominion Prouder in his Love  And while with Pride and Appetite he swells  e courts no chosen Object but compels  o Subject his lov'd Mistress dares deny  ut yields his hopes up to his Tyranny  Long had this Prince imperiously thus sway'd  y no set Laws but by his Will obey'd  is fearful Slaves to full Obedience grown  dmire his strength and dare not use their own  One Subject most did his suspicion move  hat show'd least Fear and counterfeited Love  the best Pastures by his side he fed  rm'd with two large Militia's on his head  As if he practis'd Majesty he walk'd  And at his Nod he made not hast but stalk'd  By his large shade he saw how great he was  And his vast Layers on the bended Grass  His thought as large as his proportion grew  And judg'd himself as fit for Empire too  Thus to Rebellious hopes he swell'd at length  Love and Ambition growing with his strength  This hid Ambition his bold Passion shows  And from a Subject to a Rival grows  Sollicites all his Princes fearful Dames  And in his fight Courts with rebellious flames  The Prince sees this with an inflamed Eye  But looks are only signs of Majesty  When once a Prince's Will meets a restraint  His Power is then esteem'd but his Complaint  His Head then shakes at which the affrighted Herd  Start to each side his Rival not afear'd  Stands by his Mistress side and stirs not thence  But bids her own his Love and his Defence  The Quarrel now to a vast height is grown  Both urg'd to fight by Passion and a Throne  But Love has most excuse for all we find  Have Passions tho' not Thrones alike assign'd  The Sovereign Stag shaking his loaded head  On which his  Scepters  with his  Arms  were spread  Wisely by Nature there together fix'd  Where with the Tittle the Defence was mixt  The pace which he advanc'd with to engage  Became at once his Majesty and Rage  'Tother stands still with as much confidence  To make his part seem only his defence  Their heads now meet and at one blow each strikes  As many strokes as if a Rank of Pikes  Grew on his brows as thick their Antlets stand  Which every Year kind Nature does disband  Wild Beasts sometimes in peace and quiet are  But Man no season frees from Love or War  VVith equal strength they met as if two Oaks  Had fell and mingled with a thousand strokes  One by ambition urg'd t'other disdain  One to preserve the other fought to Gain  The Subjects and the Mistresses stood by  VVith Love and Duty to crown Victory  For all Affections wait on prosperous Fame  Not he that climbs but he that falls meet shame  VVhile thus with equal Courages they meet  The wounded Earth yields to their strugling Feet  And while one slides t'other pursues the Fight  And thinks that forc't Retreat looks like a Flight  But then asham'd of his Retreat at length  Drives his Foe back his Rage renews his strength  As even weights into a motion thrown  By equal turns drive themselves up and down  So sometimes one then 'tother Stag prevails  And Victory yet doubtful holds the Scales  The Prince asham'd to be oppos'd so long  VVith all his strength united rushes on  The Rebel weaker than at first appears  And from his Courage sinks unto his Fears  Not able longer to withstand his might  From a Retreat at last steals to a Flight  The mighty Stag pursues his flying Foe  Till his own Pride of Conquest made him slow  Thought it enough to scorn a thing that flies  And only now pursu'd him with his Eyes  The vanquish'd as he fled turn'd back his fight  Asham'd to flie and yet afraid to fight  Sometimes his wounds as his excuse survey'd  Then fled again and then look'd back and stay'd  Blush't that his wounds so slight should not deny  Strength for a fight that left him strength to flie  Calls thoughts of Love and Empire to his Aid  But fears more powerful than all those persuade  And yet in spight of them retains his shame  His cool'd ambition and his halfquench'd flame  There's none from their own sense of shame can flie  And dregs of Passions dwell with misery  Now to the shades he bends his feeble course  Despis'd by those that once admir'd his force  The VVretch that to a scorn'd Condition's thrown  VVith the VVorld's Favour loses too his own  VVhile fawning Troops their Conquering Prince enclos'd  Now render'd absolute by being oppo  'd  Princes by Disobedience get Command  And by new quench'd Rebellions firmer stand  Till by the boundless offers of success  They meet their Fate in illus'd happiness  The vanquish'd Stag to thickest shades repairs  VVhere he finds safety punish't with his Cares  Thorough the VVoods he rushes not but glides  And from all searches but his own he hides  Asham'd to live unwilling yet to lose  That wretched life he knew not how to use  In this Retirement thus he liv'd conceal'd  Till with his wounds his fears were almost heal'd  His ancient Passions now began to move  He thought again of Empire and of Love  Then rouz'd himself and stretch'd at his full length  Took the large measure of his mighty strength  Then shook his loaded Head the shadow too  Shook like a tree where leaveless Branches grew  Stooping to drink he sees it in the Streams  And in the Woods hears clashing of his Beams  No Accident but does alike proclaim  His growing strength and his encreasing shame  Now once again resolves to try his Fate  for Envy always is importunate  And in the mind perpetually does move  A fit Companion for unquiet Love  He thinks upon his mighty Enemy  Circl'd about with Pow'r and Luxury  And hop'd his strength might sink in his desires  Remembring he had wasted in such Fires  Yet while he hop'd by them to overcome  He wish'd the others fatal joys his own  Thus the unquiet Beast in fasety lay  VVhere nothing was to fear nor to obey  Where he alone commanded and was Lord  Of every Bounty Nature did afford  Chose Feasts for every Arbitrary Sense  An Empire in the state of Innocence  But all the Feasts Nature before him plac't  Had but faint relishes to his lost taste  Sick Minds like Bodies in a Fever spent  Turn Food to the Disease not nourishment  Sometimes he stole abroad and shrinking stood  Under the shelter of the friendly Wood  Casting his envious Eyes towards those Plains  Where with crown'd joys his mighty Rival Reigns  He saw th' obeying Herd marching along  And weigh'd his Rival's Greatness by the Throng  Want takes false Measures both of Power and Joys  And envy'd Greatness is but Crowd and Noise  Not able to endure this hated sight  Back to the Shades he flies to seek out Nigt  Like exiles from their native Soils though sent  To better Countries think it Banishment  Here he enjoy'd what t'other could have there  The woods are shady and the streams as clear  The Pastures more untainted where he fed  And every Night chose out an unprest Bed  But then his lab'ring Soul with Dreams was prest  And found the greatest weariness in rest  His dreadful Rival in his sleep appears  And in his Dreams again he fights and fears  Shrinks at the strokes of t'others mighty Head  Feels every wound and dreams how fast he fled  At this he wakes and with his fearful Eyes  Salutes the light that fleet the  Eastern  Skies  Still half amaz'd looks round and held by fear  Scarce can believe no Enemy was near  But when he saw his heedless fears were brought  Not by a Substance but a drowsie Thought  His ample sides he shakes from whence the dew  In scatter'd Showers like driven Tempests flew  At which through all his breast new boldness spread  And with his Courage rais'd his mighty head  Then by his Love inspir'd resolves to try  The Combat now and overcome or die  Every weak Passion sometimes is above  The fear of death much more the noblest love  By hope 'tis scorn'd and by despair 'tis sought  Pursu'd by Honour and by Sorrow brought  Resolv'd the paths of danger now to tread  From his scorn'd shelter and his fears he fled  VVith a brave hast now seeks a second Fight  Redeems the base one by a Noble Flight  In the mean time the Conqueror enjoy'd  That Power by which he was to be destroy'd  How hard 'tis for the Prosperous to see  That fate which waits on Power and Victory  Thus he secuerly Reign'd when in a Rout  He saw th' affrighted Herd flying about  As if some Huntsmen did their Chase pursue  About themselves in scatter'd Rings they flew  He like a careful Monarch rais'd his Head  To see what cause that strange disturbance bread  But when the searchtout Cause appear'd no more  Than from a Slave he had o'ercome before  A bold disdain did in his looks appear  And shook his aweful Head to chide their Fear  The Herd afraid of Friend and Enemy  Shrink from the one and from the other fly  They scarce know which they should Obey or Trust  Since Fortune only makes it Safe and Just  Yet in despight of all his Pride he staid  And this unlook't for Chance with trouble weigh'd  His Rage and his Contempt alike swell'd high  And only fear'd his Enemy should fly  He thought of former Conquest and from thence  Cozen'd himself into a Confidence  T'other that saw his Conquerer so near  Stood still and list'ned to a whisp'ring fear  From whence she heard his Conquest and his Shame  But newborn Hopes his ancient Fears o'recame  The mighty Enemies now meet at length  VVith equal Fury though not equal Strength  For now too late the Conquerer did find  That all was wasted in him but his Mind  His Courage in his VVeakness yet prevails  As a bold Pilot steers with tatter'd Sails  And Cordage crackt directs no steddy Course  Carry'd by Resolution more than Force  Before his once scorn'd Enemy he reels  His wounds encreasing with his shame he feels  The others strength more from his weakness grows  And with one furious push his Rival throws  So a tall Oak the Pride of all the VVood  That long th'assault of several storms hath stood  Till by a mighty blast more pow'rfully push't  His Roots torn up and to the Earth he rusht  Yet then he rais'd his Head on which there grew  Once all his Power and all his Title too  Unable now to rise and less to fight  He rais'd those Scepters to demand his Right  But such weak Arguments prevail with none  To plead their Titles when their Power is gone  His Head now sinks and with it all defence  Not only robb'd of Power but Pretence  Wounds upon wounds the Conqueror still gives  And thinks himself unsafe while t'other lives  Unhappy State of such as wear a Crown  Fortune does seldom lay'em gently down  Now to the most scorn'd Remedy he flies  And for some Pity seems to move his Eyes  Pity by which the best of Vertu's try'd  To wretched Princes ever is deny'd  There is a Debt to Fortune which they pay  For all their Greatness by no common way  The flatt'ring Troops unto the Victor fly  And own his Title to his Victory  The Faith of most with Fortune does decline  Duty's but Fear and Conscience but Design  The Victor now proud in his great success  Hastes to enjoy his fatal happiness  Forgot his mighty Rival was destroy'd  But that which he so fondly now enjoy'd  In Passions thus Nature her self enjoys  Sometimes preserves and then again destroys  Yet all Destruction which Revenge can move  Time or Ambition is supply'd by Love  To my Honoured Friend Sir  ROBERT HOWARD  On his Excellent Poem  By Mr  John Dryden    AS there is
