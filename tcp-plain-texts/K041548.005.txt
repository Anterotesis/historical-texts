GL' INTELLETTI SANI  MIRATE LA DOTTRINA CHE SI ASCONDE  SOTTO' IL VELAME DEGLI VERSI STRANT  DANTE Inferno Canto  PREFACE  IT seems to be a kind of duty incumbent on those who devote themselves to Poetry to raise if possible the dignity of a declining Art by making it as beneficial to Life and Manners as the limits of Composition and the character of modern Times will allow The ages indeed are past in which the song of the Poet was idolized for its  miraculous effects  yet a Poem intended to promote the cultivation of goodhumour may still perhaps be fortunate enough to prove of some little service to society in general or if this idea may be thought too chimerical and romantic by sober Reason it is at least one of those pleasing and innocent delusions in which a poetical Enthusiast may be safely indulged  The following production owes its existence to an incident in real life very similar to the principal action of  the last Canto but in forming the general plan of the work it seemed to me absolutely necessary to introduce both the agency and the abode of SPLEEN notwithstanding the difficulty and the hazard of attempting a subject so happily executed by the masterly pencil of Pope I considered his Cave of Spleen as a most exquisite cabinet picture and to avoid the servility of imitation I determined to sketch the mansion of this gloomy Power on a much wider canvass Happy indeed if the judgment of the Public may enable me to exclaim with the honest vanity of the Painter who compared his own works to the divine productions of Raphael  "E son Pittore anch' Io"  The celebrated Alessandro Tassoni who is generally considered as the inventor of the modern Heroicomic Poetry was so proud of having extended the limits of his art by a new kind of composition that he not only spoke of it with infinite exultation in one of his private letters but even gave a MS copy of his work to his native city of Modena with an inscription in which he stiled it a new species of Poetry invented by himself  A few partial friends have asserted that the present performance has some degree of similar merit but as I apprehend all the novelty it possesses may rather require an apology than entitle its Author to challenge commendation I shall explain how far the conduct of the Poem differs from the most approved models in this mode of writing and slightly mention the poetical effects which such a variation appeared likely to produce  It is well known that the favourite Poems which blend the serious and the comic represent their principal characters in a satirical point of view It was the intention of Tassoni though prudence made him attempt to conceal it to satirize a particular Italian Nobleman who happened to be the object of his resentment Boileau openly ridicules the French Ecclesiastics in his Lutrin Garth our English Physicians in his Dispensary and the Rape of the Lock itself that most excellent and enchanting Poem which I never contemplate but with new idolatry is denominated  the best Satire extant  by the learned Dr Warton in his very clegant and ingenious but severe Essay on Pope A sentence which seems to be confirmed by the Poet himself in his letter to Mrs Fermor where he says  "the character  of Belinda as it is now managed resembles you in nothing but in beauty"  Though I think that no composition can surpass or perhaps ever equal this most happy effort of Genius as a sportive Satire I imagined it might be possible to give a new Character to this mixed species of Poetry and to render it by its Object though not in its Execution more noble than the most beautiful and refined Satire can be We have seen it carried to inimitable perfection in the most delicate raillery on Female FoiblesIt remained to be tried if it might not also aspire to delineate the more engaging features of Female Excellence The idea appeared to me worth the experiment for if it succeeded it seemed to promise a double advantage first it would give an air of novelty to the Poem and secondly what I thought of much greater importance it would render it more interesting to the heart On these principles I have endeavoured to paint  SERENA  as a most lovely engaging and accomplished character yet I hope the colouring is so faithfully copied from  general Nature  that every man who reads the Poem may be happy enough to know many Fair ones who resemble my Heroine  There is another point in which I have also attempted to give this Poem an air of novelty I mean the manner of connecting the real and the visionary scenes which compose it by shifting these in alternate Cantos I hoped to make familiar Incident and allegorical Picture afford a strong relief to each other and keep the attention of the Reader alive by an appearance particularly diversified I wished indeed but I fear most ineffectually for powers to unite some touches of the sportive wildness of Ariosto and the more serious sublime painting of Dante with some portion of the enchanting elegance the refined imagination and the moral graces of Pope and to do this if possible without violating those rules of propriety which Mr Cambridge has illustrated by example as well as precept in The Scribleriad and in his sensible Preface to that elegant and learned Poem  I have now very frankly informed my Reader of the  extent  or rather of the  extravagance  of my desire for I will not give it the serious name of  design  They whom an enlightened taste has rendered thoroughly sensible how very difficult it must be to accomplish such an idea will not only be the first to discern but the most  ready to pardon those errors into which so hazardous an attempt may perhaps have betrayed me I had thoughts of introducing this performance to the Public by a Dissertation of considerable length on this species of Poetry but I forbear to indulge myself any farther in such preliminary remarks as the anxiety of authors is so apt to produce from the reflection that however ingeniously written they add little or nothing to the success of a good Poem and are utterly insufficient to prevent that neglect or oblivion which is the inevitable fate of a bad one  In dismissing a work to my Fair Readers which is intended principally for their perusal I shall only recommend it to their attention and bid them farewell in the words of the pleasant and courteous Tassoni  "Vaglia il buon voler s' altro non lice  "E chi la leggera viva felice"  EARTHAM  Jan  THE TRIUMPHS OF TEMPER  CANTO I  THE Mind's soft Guardian who tho' yet unsung  Inspires with harmony the Female tongue  And gives improving every tender grace  The smile of angels to a mortal face  Her powers I sing and scenes of mental strife  Which form the maiden for th' accomplish'd wife  Where the sweet victor sees with sparkling eyes  Love her reward and Happiness her prize  Daughters of Beauty who the song inspire  To your enchanting notes attune my lyre  And O if haply your soft hearts may gain  Or use or pleasure from the motley strain  Tho' formal critics with a surly frown  Deny your artless Bard the laurel crown  He still shall triumph if ye deign to spread  Your sweeter myrtle round his honour'd head  In your bright circle young SERENA grew  A lovelier nymph the pencil never drew  For the fond Graces form'd her easy mien  And Heaven's soft azure in her eye was seen  She seem'd a rosebud when it first receives  The genial sun in its expanding leaves  For now she enter'd those important years  When the full bosom swells with hopes and fears  When conscious Nature prompts the secret sigh  And sheds sweet languor o'er the melting eye  When nobler toys the female heart trepan  And Dolls rejected yield their place to Man  Beneath a Father's care SERENA grew  The good SIR GILBERT to his country true  A faithful Whig who zealous for the state  In Freedom's service led the loud debate  Yet every day by transmutation rare  Turn'd to a Tory in his elbowchair  And made his daughter pay howe'er absurd  Passive obedience to his sovereign word  In his domestic sway he borrow'd aid  From prim PENELOPE an ancient maid  His upright Sister conscious of her worth  Who valued still her beauty and her birth  Tho' from her birth no envied rank she gain'd  And of her beauty but the ghost remain'd  A restless ghost that with remembrance keen  Proclaim'd incessant what it once had been  Delighted still the steps of youth to haunt  To watch the tender nymph and warm gallant  And with an eye that petrified pursuit  Hang like the dragon o'er th' Hesperian fruit  Tho' strictly guarded by this jealous power  The mild SERENA no restraint could sour  Pure was her bosom as the silver lake  Ere rising winds the ruffled water shake  When the bright pageants of the morning sky  Across th' expansive mirror lightly fly  By vernal gales in quick succession driven  While the clear glass reflects the smile of heaven  In gay content a sportive life she led  The child of Modesty by Virtue bred  Her light companions Innocence and Ease  Her hope was Pleasure and her wish to please  For this to Fashion early rites she paid  For this to Venus secret vows she made  Nor held it sin to cast a private glance  O'er the dear pages of a new romance  Eager in Fiction's touching scenes to find  A field to exercise her youthful mind  The touching scenes new energy imprest  On all the virtues of her feeling breast  Sweet Evelina's fascinating power  Had first beguil'd of sleep her midnight hour  Possest by Sympathy's enchanting sway  She read unconscious of the dawning day  The Modern Anecdote was next convey'd  Beneath her pillow by her faithful maid  The nymph attentive as the brooding dove  Pored o'er the tender scenes of Franzel's love  The sinking taper now grew weak and pale  SERENA sigh'd and dropt th' unfinish'd tale  But as warm clouds in vernal aether roll  The soft ideas floated in her soul  Free from ambitious pride and envious care  To love and to be lov'd was all her prayer  While these fond thoughts her gentle mind possess'd  Soft slumber settled on her snowy breast  Scarce had her radiant eyes began to close  When to her view a friendly vision rose  A fairy Phantom struck her mental sight  Light as the gossamer as aether bright  Array'd like Pallas was the pigmy form  When the sage Goddess stills the martial storm  Her casque was amber richly grac'd above  With down collected from the callow dove  Her burnish'd breastplate of a deeper dye  Was once the armour of a golden fly  A lynx's eye her little aegis shone  By fairy spells converted into stone  And worn of old as elfin poets sing  By Aegypt's lovely queen a favourite ring  Mysterious power was in the magic toy  To turn the frowns of care to smiles of joy  Her tiny lance whose radiance stream'd afar  Was one bright sparkle from the bridal star  A filmy mantle round her figure play'd  Fine as the texture by Arachne laid  O'er some young plant when glittering to the view  With many an orient pearl of morning dew  The Phantom hover'd o'er the conscious Fair  With such a lively smile of tender care  As on her elfin lord Titania cast  When first she found his angry spell was past  Round her rich locks SERENA chanc'd to tie  An ample ribband of caerulean dye  High o'er her forehead rose the graceful bow  Whose arch commanded the sweet scene below  The hovering Spirit view'd the tempting spot  And lightly perch'd on this unbending knot  As the fair flutterer of Psyche's race  Is seen to terminate her airy chace  When pleas'd at length her quivering wings to close  Fondly she settles on the fragrant rose  Now in soft notes more musically clear  Than ever Fairy breath'd in mortal ear  These words the visionary voice convey'd  To the charm'd spirit of the sleeping maid  "Thou darling of my care whose ripen'd worth  Shall spread my empire o'er the smiling earth  Whom Nature blest forbidding modish Art  To cramp thy spirit or contract thy heart  Screen'd from thy thought nor in thy visions felt  Long on thy opening mind I've fondly dwelt  In childhood's sorrows brought thee quick relief  And dry'd thy April showers of infant grief  Taught thee to laugh at the malicious boy  Who broke thy playthings with a barbarous joy  To bear what ills the little Female haunt  The testy Nurse the imperious Governante  And that tyrannic pest the prying maiden Aunt  Now ripening years a nobler scene supply  For life now opens on thy sparkling eye  Thy rising bosom swells with just desire  Rapture to feel and rapture to inspire  Not the vain bliss the transitory joys  That childish Woman feels in radiant toys  The costly Diamond or the lighter Pearl  The massive Nabob or the tinsel Earl  Thy heart demands each meaner aim above  Th' imperishable wealth of sterling love  Thy wish to please by ev'ry softer grace  Of elegance and ease of form and face  By lively fancy and by sense refin'd  The stronger magic of the cultur'd mind  Thy pure ambition and thy virtuous plan  To fix the variable heart of Man  Short is the worship paid at Beauty's shrine  But lasting Love and Happiness are mine  Mine tho' the earth's mistaken blinded race  Despise my influence and my name debase  Nor breathe one vow to that aetherial friend  On whom the colours of their life depend  But to thy innocence I'll now display  The mystic marvels of my secret sway  And tell in this thy fatedeciding hour  My race my name my office and my power  First hear what wonders human forms contain  And learn the texture of the Female brain  By Nature's care in curious order spread  This living net is fram'd of tender thread  Fine as thy hand some favour'd youth to grace  Knits with nice art to form the mimic lace  Within the center of this fretted dome  Her secret tower her heavenconstructed home  Soft Sensibility sweet Beauty's soul  Keeps her coy state and animates the whole  Invisible as Harmony who springs  Wak'd by young Zephyr from Aeolian strings  Her subtle power more delicately fine  Dwells in each thread and lives in every line  Whose quick vibrations without end impart  Pleasure and pain to the responsive heart  As Zephyr's breath the willing chord inspires  Whispering soft music to the trembling wires  So with fond care I regulate unseen  The softer movements of this nice machine  TEMPER my earthly name the nurse of Love  But call'd SOPHROSYNE in realms above  When lovely Woman perfect at her birth  Blest with her early charms the wond'ring earth  Her soul in sweet simplicity array'd  Nor shar'd my guidance nor requir'd my aid  Her tender frame nor confident nor coy  Had every fibre tun'd to gentle joy  No vain caprices swell'd her pouting lip  No gold produc'd a mercenary trip  Soft innocence inspir'd her willing kiss  Her love was nature and her life was bliss  Guide of his reason not his passion's prey  She tamed the savage Man who bless'd her sway  No jarring wishes fill'd the world with woes  But youth was ecstacy and age repose  The Powers of Mischief met in dark Divan  To blast these mighty joys of envied Man  The Fiends at their infernal Leader's call  Fram'd their base wiles in Demogorgon's hall  In the deep center of that dreadful dome  An hellish cauldron boil'd with fiery foam  In this wide urn the circling spirits threw  Ingredients harsh and hideous to the view  Page  Stothard del Sharp sculp  t    London Published Sept  st  by T Cadell Strand  While the terrific master of the spell  With adjurations shook the depths of hell  And in dark words unmeet for mortal ear  Bade the dire offspring of his art appear  Forth from the vase with sullen murmurs broke  A towering mass of pestilential smoke  Emerging from this fog of thickest night  A Phantom swells by slow degrees to sight  But ere the view can seize the forming shape  From the mock'd eye its lineaments escape  It seem'd all passions melted into one  Assum'd the face of all and yet was none  Hell stood aghast at its portentous mien  And shuddering Demons call'd the spectre Spleen  Hie thee to earth its mighty master cried  O'er the vex'd globe in heavy vapours ride  Within its center fix thy shadowy throne  With shades thy subjects and that hell thy own  Reign there unseen but let thy strong controul  Be hourly felt in Woman's wayward soul  With darkest poisons from our deep abyss  Taint that pure fountain of terrestrial bliss  Th' enormous Phantom at this potent sound  Roll'd forth obedient from the vast profound  The quaking Fiends recover'd from their dread  And Hell grew lighter as the monster fled  But now round earth the gliding vapours run  Blot the rich aether and eclipse the sun  All Nature sickens and her fairest flower  Enchanting Woman feels the baneful power  As in her soul the clouds of Spleen arise  The sprightly essence of her beauty flies  In youth's gay prime in hours with rapture warm  Love looks astonish'd on her altering form  To pleasing frolics and enchanting wiles  Lifedarting looks and soulsubduing smiles  Dark whims succeed thickcoming fancies fret  The sullen passion and the hasty pet  The swelling lip the teardistended eye  The peevish question the perverse reply  The moody humour that like rain and fire  Blends cold disgust with unsubdu'd desire  Flies what it loves and petulantly coy  Feigns proud abhorrence of the proffer'd joy  For Nature's artless aim the wish to please  By genuine modesty and simple ease  Fashion's pert tricks the crowded brain oppress  With all the poor parade of tawdry dress  The sickly bosom pants for noise and shew  For every bauble and for every beau  The voice that Health made harmony disowns  That native charm for Languor's mimic tones  And feigns disease till feeling what it feigns  Its fancied maladies are real pains  Such and a thousand still superior woes  From Spleen's new empire o'er the earth arose  Each simple dictate of the soul forgot  Then first was form'd the mercenary plot  AndBeauty practis'd that pernicious art  The art of angling for an old man's heart  Tho' crawling to his bride with tottering knees  His words were dotage and his love disease  From sex to sex this base contagion ran  And Gold grew Beauty in the eyes of Man  Courtship was traffic and the married life  But one loud jangle of incessant strife  The gentle Sprite who on his radiant car  Shines the mild regent of the eveningstar  And joys from thence those genial rays to shed  That lead the bridegroom to the nuptial bed  While earth's new ills his friendly soul absorb  From Cynthia call'd me to his kindred orb  And eager to redress the woes of Man  The brilliant Son of Vesper thus began  "Thou softest Being of the aetherial kind  Be thy benignant cares no more confin'd  To smooth the ruffled plume of Zephyr's wing  To guard from cruel frost the infant spring  To drive gross atoms from the rays of noon  Or chase the halo from the vapourish moon  Thy friendly nature will not now deny  To quit for nobler toils thy native sky  Thou seest how Spleen's infernal vapours roll  Across the sweet serene of Woman's soul  And earth which darkens as her beauties fade  Must grow a second hell without thy aid  Take then thy station fix thy nobler reign  O'er those fine chords that form the Female brain  That us'd ere injur'd by the rust of Spleen  To fill with harmony the human scene  Go lest her touch their tender tones destroy  Teach them to vibrate to thy notes of joy  Go and restore by stilling mental strife  Health to faint Love and happiness to Life"  So spake that friend of Man who lights above  His heavenly lamp of Hymenaeal love  In his just aim my kindred spirit join'd  And flew obedient to the charge assign'd  Hence as the biass sways the unconscious bowl  I long unseen have sway'd the careless soul  Tho' oft I feel my power by Spleen subdu'd  In the shrill Vixen and the sullen Prude  In some fair forms my soft dominion grows  Like fragance rising from the opening rose  Still I preserve in many a lovely face  That gay goodhumour and that constant grace  Which heavenly Powers united to infold  In perfect Woman's newcreated mould  When Nature in her infant beauty blest  The last and loveliest of her works carest  But of those Nymphs who delicately fair  Draw their soft graces from my forming care  My young SERENA shines her peers above  Pride of my hopes and darling of my love  Hence I to thee such mysteries unfold  As Man's pedantic eye shall ne'er behold  Whose narrow science tho' it proudly boast  To pierce the sky and count the starry host  Sees not the lucid band of airy Powers  Who flutter round him in his secret hours  But if to me thy guardian now display'd  Thy duteous orisons are justly paid  Thou to those realms shalt pass with me thy guide  Where Spleen's pale victims after death reside  Then to that orb in vision shalt thou rise  Unseen by mortal astronomic eyes  Where Ibut first let me thy soul prepare  To meet our secret foe's insidious snare  'Tis my fond purpose in thy form to shew  The sweetest model of my skill below  A Youth I destine to thy dear embrace  Crown'd with each mental charm and manly grace  With whom thy innocence secure from strife  Shall reap the beauteous joys of blameless life  Pleas'd I observe thy little heart begin  To ask what charms the mighty prize may win  But know tho' Elegance herself be seen  To guide thy motion and to form thy mien  Tho' Beauty o'er thy filial cheek diffuse  The soft enchantment of her roseate hues  Not from their favour shall this glory rise  TEMPER shall singly gain the splendid prize  The sudden conquest shall be mine alone  And Love with transport shall my triumph own  Such are my hopes but I with pain relate  What hard conditions are annex'd by Fate  As chemic fires that patient labour blows  Draw the rich perfume from the Persian rose  So must thou form by fiery toils refin'd  The living essence of thy sweeter mind  Dimly I see on Destiny's dull glass  Three dangerous trials 'tis thy doom to pass  And oh if once forgetful of my power  Goodhumour fail thee in the fatal hour  Farewell those joys that wait the happy wife  Farewell the vision of unclouded life  Fain would my love thy secret perils shew  Which Fate allows not even me to know  In Spleen's dark court a thousand agents dwell  Who bind her victims in the wayward spell  Perchance three prime supporters of her sway  The busiest of her Fiends may cross thy way  Stern Contradiction her illfavour'd child  Of fierce demeanor and of spirit wild  Bane of delight and horror of the sex  His plan to puzzle and his pride to vex  Or Scandal filthy hag who blindly limps  Round the wide earth supported by her Imps  Her inky Demons who delight to print  Her base suggestion and her envious hint  Or groundless Jealousy pert changeling born  Of amorous Vanity and angry Scorn  Whose bitter taunts with public insult dare  Basely to wound the unoffending Fair  Proud the sweet joys of Innocence to crush  And spread o'er Beauty's cheek the burning blush  Whether these kindred Fiends or one or all  Shall aim thy airy spirit to enthrall  Are points my fondness tries in vain to reach  But trust my caution and beware of each  Lest to thy lively mind my words may seem  The vain chimera of a common dream  By one unquestionable sign be taught  To prize my presence in thy waking thought  An azure ribband on thy toilet thrown  Shall make the magic of my empire known  On this thy sportive needle tried its powers  And silver spangles form'd the mimic flowers  On these my love shall breathe a secret charm  With this my Caestus thy soft bosom arm  Above it let the decent tucker rise  To hide the mystic band from mortal eyes  When Spleen's dark Powers would teach that breast to swell  This guardian Cincture shall those Powers repel  As the touch'd talisman more swift than thought  To save her charge th' Arabian Fairy brought  So shall this Zone if justly I'm obey'd  Bring my soft spirit to thy certain aid  In Love's great name observe this high behest  Revere my powerBe gentle and be blest"  Here the kind Sprite her friendly counsel clos'd  And lightly vanish'dStill SERENA doz'd  Still in sweet trance she fondly seem'd to hear  The soft persuasion vibrate in her ear  But waking now far different notes she found  Less pleasing echoes in her chamber sound  For now the heralds of the London day  Sing their loud mattins in th' uncrowded way  Th' impatient Milkmaid now with early din  Screams to the rattle of her pail of tin  With Sweep's faint cry and latest of the crew  The deepton'd music of the murmuring Jew  END OF THE FIRST CANTO  CANTO II  YE radiant Nymphs whose opening eyes convey  Warmth to the world and lustre to the day  Think what o'ershadowing clouds may cross your brain  Before those lovely lids shall close again  What funds of Patience twelve long hours may ask  When cold Discretion claims her daily task  Ah think betimes and while your morning care  Sheds foreign odors o'er your fragrant hair  Tinge your soft spirit with that mental sweet  Which may not be exhal'd by Passion's heat  But charm the sense with undecaying power  Thro' every chance of each diurnal hour  O might you all perceive your toilets crown'd  With such cosmetics as SERENA found  For to the warning Vision fondly true  Now the quick Fairone to the toilet flew  With keen delight her ravish'd eye survey'd  The mystic ribband on her mirror laid  Bright shone the azure as Aurora's car  And every spangle seem'd a living star  With sportive grace the smiling damsel prest  The guardian Cincture to her snowy breast  More lovely far than Juno when she strove  To look most lovely in the eyes of Jove  And willing Venus lent her every power  That sheds enchantment o'er the amorous hour  For spells more potent on this band were thrown  Than Venus boasted in her beauteous zone  Her dazzling Caestus could alone inspire  The sudden impulse of shortliv'd desire  These finer threads with lasting charms are fraught  Here lies the tender but unchanging thought  Silence that wins where eloquence is vain  And Tones that harmonize the mad'ning brain  Soft Sighs that Anger cannot hear and live  And Smiles that tell how truly they forgive  And lively Grace whose gay diffusive light  Puts the black phantoms of the brain to flight  Whose cheering powers thro' every period last  And make the present happy as the past  Such secret charms this richer Zone possest  Whose flowers now sparkling on SERENA's breast  Give tho' unseen those swelling orbs they bind  Smiles to her face and beauty to her mind  For now observant of the Sprite's behest  The Nymph conceals them by her upper vest  Safe lies the spell no mortal may descry  Not keen PENELOPE's allpiercing eye  Who constant as the steps of morn advance  Surveys the houshold with a searching glance  And entering now with all her usual care  Reviews the chamber of the youthful Fair  Beneath the pillow not compleatly hid  The Novel layShe sawshe seiz'dshe chid  With rage and glee her glaring eyeballs flash  Ah wicked age she cries ah filthy trash  From the first page my just abhorrence springs  For modern anecdotes are monstrous things  Yet will I see what dangerous poisons lurk  To taint thy youth in this licentious work  She said and rudely from the chamber rush'd  Her pallid cheek with expectation flush'd  With ardent hope her eager spirit shook  Vain hope to banquet on a luscious book  So if a Priest of the Arabian sect  In Turkish hands forbidden wine detect  The sacred Mussulman with pious din  Arraigns the culprit and proclaims the sin  Curses with holy zeal th' inflaming juice  But cursing takes it for his secret use  The gay SERENA with unruffled mind  The pleasing Novel thus unread resign'd  The Vision on her soul such virtue left  She only smil'd at the provoking theft  The teazing incident she deem'd a jest  Nor felt the Zone grow tighter on her breast  Now in full charms descends the finish'd Fair  For now the morning banquet claims her care  Already at the board with viands pil'd  Her Sire impatient sits and chides his tardy child  On his imperial lips rude Hunger reigns  And keener Politics usurp his brains  But when her loveinspiring voice he hears  When the soft magic of her smile appears  In that glad moment he at once forgets  His empty stomach and the nation's debts  He bends to Nature's more divine controul  And only feels the Father in his soul  Quick to his hand behold her now present  The Indian liquor of celestial scent  Not with more grace the nectar'd cup is given  By roselip'd Hebe to the Lord of Heaven  While her fair hands a fresh libation pour  Fashion's loud thunder wakes the sounding door  The light SERENA to the window springs  On Curiosity's amusive wings  Her quick eyes sparkle with surprise to see  The glories of a golden visàvis  Its glittering tablet gleam'd with mimic pearl  And the rich coronet announc'd an Earl  The good old Knight grew somewhat proud to hear  Of this new visit from the early Peer  SERENA recollects the Vision's truth  And fluttering hopes it is the promis'd Youth  PENELOPE from her high chamber peeps  There her unfinish'd charms she coyly keeps  With sage reserve her modesty abhorr'd  To shew her morning face before a Lord  The Peer alights the wellrang'd vassals bawl  His sounding title thro' the spacious hall  Till in the deep saloon's extremest bound  Th' eartickling words "LORD FILLIGREE" resound  As when great Hector setting war apart  Advanc'd to parley with his spear athwart  The Greeks beheld him with a still delight  And silent reverence stopt the rising fight  With such respect but unchastis'd by fear  Sir GILBERT and the Nymph first meet the Peer  And while his morning compliments commence  The slighted breakfast stands in cold suspence  But far unlike to Hector's ruder grace  His modern stature and his modish face  Nor less he differs from those Barons old  Whose arms are blazon'd on his car of gold  Whose prostrate castle guarded once the lands  Where spruce in motley pride his villa stands  By Taste erected in her trimmest mode  Her mushroom structure and her quaint abode  As the neat Daisy to the Sun's broad flower  As the French Boudoir to the Gothic Tower  Such is the Peer whom Fashion much admires  Compar'd in person to his ancient sires  For their broad shoulder and their brawny calf  Their coarse loud language and their coarser laugh  His finer form more elegantly slim  Displays the fasionable length of limb  With foreign shrugs his country he regards  And her lean tongue with foreign words he lards  While Gallic Graces who correct his style  Forbid his mirth to pass beyond a smile  As the nice workman in the wooden trade  Hides his coarse ground with finest woods o'erlaid  Thus our young Lord with Fashion's phrase refin'd  Fineer'd the mean interior of his mind  And hence in Courtesy's soft lustre seen  His spirit shone as graceful as his mien  The artless Fair on Fashion's kind report  Thought him the mirror of a matchless Court  Much she his dress his language much observes  Whose finer accents prove his feeling nerves  Her fancy now the destin'd Lover spies  But her free heart abjures the quick surmise  Yet as he spoke at every flattering word  The Vision's promise to her thought recurr'd  Far more parental pride contrives to blind  The good Sir GILBERT's moreexperienc'd mind  Who fondly saw and at the prospect smil'd  A future Countess in his favourite child  But what new flutterings shook SERENA's breast  What hopes and fears the modest Nymph opprest  When with a simpering smile and soft regard  The Peer display'd a mirthexpressive card  Where the gay Graces in a sportive band  Shew the sweet art of Cipriani's hand  Where in their train his airy Cupids throng  And laughing drag a comic mask along  "We" cries my Lord with selfsufficient joy  Twirling with lordly airs the graceful toy  "We who possess true science we who give  The world a lesson in the art to live  We for the the Fair a splendid Fête design  And pay our homage thus at Beauty's shrine"  He spoke and speaking to the blushing Maid  With modish ease th' inviting card convey'd  Where Mirth announc'd her masquedevoted hour  In characters intwin'd with many a flower  The blushing Maid with eyes of quick desire  View'd it and felt her little soul on fire  For of all scenes she had not yet survey'd  Her heart most panted for a Masquerade  But her gay hopes increasing terrors drown  And dread forebodings of her Father's frown  In mute suspence to read his thought she tries  And strongly pleads with her prevailing eyes  Her eyes for doubt enchain'd her modest tongue  While on his sovereign word her pleasure hung  With such a tender and persuasive air  Of soft endearment and of anxious care  Thetis attended from th' almighty Sire  His fateful answer to her fond desire  The good old Knight like the Olympian God  Blest the fair Suppliant with his gracious nod  Her lively spirit the kind signal took  And her glad heart in every fibre shook  The party settled it imports not how  The Peer politely made his parting bow  The Nymph with eyes that sparkled joyous fire  Kiss'd the round cheek of her complying Sire  Then swiftly flew and summon'd to her aid  Th' important counsel of her favourite maid  To vent her joy and as the moments press  To fix that first of points a Fancydress  Quick as the Poet's eyes o'er Nature fly  Piercing the deep or traversing the sky  With such light speed her fond ideas glance  O'er play and poem story and romance  While all the Characters she e'er has read  Flash on her brain and fill her busy head  Now in Diana's form she hopes to meet  A fond Endymion sighing at her feet  Now her proud thought terrestrial pomp assumes  And Dian's crescent yields to Indian plumes  Now in the habit of the Grecian Isles  She hears some Osman suing for her smiles  And sees his soul that blaze of dress outshine  Whose wealth impoverish'd a diamondmine  Now simpler charms her quick attention draw  The rosecrown'd bonnet and the hat of straw  A Villagemaid she seems in neat attire  A faithful Shepherd now her sole desire  Thus as new figures in her fancy throng  "She's every thing by starts and nothing long"  But in the space of one revolving hour  Flies thro' all states of Poverty and Power  All forms on whom her veering mind can pitch  Sultana Gipsy Goddess Nymph and Witch  At length her soul with Shakespeare's magic fraught  The wand of Ariel fixt her roving thought  Ariel's light graces all her heart possess  And Jenny's order'd to prepare the dress  It seems already bought with fond applause  An azure tissue and a silver gauze  Too soon alas that garb of heavenly hue  The ready Mercer flashes to her view  Nescia mens hominum fati sortisque futurae  Et servare modum rebus sublata secundis  Turno tempus erit magno cum optaverit emptum

prove  Her robe of triumph and a spell to Love  To thee sweet Maid whose pleasuredarting eyes  Joy in this favourite vest an hour shall rise  When thou shalt hate the silk so fondly sought  And wish thy silverspotted gauze unbought  For busy Spleen thy trial now prepares  Darkly she forms her unsuspected snares  And keen to raise her pleasurekilling storm  Assumes PENELOPE's congenial form  In that prim shape which all the Graces shun  See the sour Fiend to good Sir GILBERT run  Where deeply pondering the Public Debt  Silent he muses o'er a new Gazette  Ent'ring she view'd with eyes of envious spite  The card that spoke the masquedevoted night  Eager she darted on the graceful toy  And fiercely pointing to each naked boy  "Canst thou" she cried in a discordant scream  That rous'd the Politician from his dream  While with her voice the echoing chamber rings  "  c  Say canst thou suffer these flagitious things  "Are these devices to thy daughter brought  "That wake such gross impurity of thought  "In vain are all the prudent words I preach  "The modest maxims that I strive to teach  "By foolish fondness of your sense beguil'd  "You still indulge and spoil the flippant

interruption vext  In his political pursuits perplext  While he with wrath th' intruding Mischief eyed  Stern to the false PENELOPE replied  "Go teazing Prude cease in my ears to vent  "Thy envious pride and peevish discontent  "To me of prudence canst thou vainly boast  "Of all my houshold thou hast plagu'd me most  "The joys thou blamest are thy dear delight  "By day the Visit and the Ball by night  "And tho' too old a Lover to trepan  "Thy midnight dream thy morning thought is Man  "Wert thou less closely to my blood allied  "Thou should'st to cure thee of thy canting pride  "Be sent to sigh alone o'er purling brooks  "Scold village maids and croak to croaking rooks"  He spoke indignant the sly Fiend withdrew  Nor inly griev'd for well her force she knew  As Indian females in a jealous hour  Of secret poison try the subtlest power  Which sure tho' slow corrodes th' unconscious prey  And ends its triumph on a distant day  Page  Stothard del Heath sculp  Published July  st  by T Cadell Strand  Thus the departing Fury left behind  Her venom latent in Sir GILBERT's mind  The hidden mischief tho' no eye observes  He feels it fretting on his alter'd nerves  But the kind habit of his healthy soul  Still struggled hard against its base controul  Now Spleen's dark vapours in his bosom hid  Prompt him the promis'd pleasure to forbid  Now Love's soft pleadings that dire thought destroy  And save the blossom of his daughter's joy  Her envious Aunt now serves him for a jest  And gay goodhumour reassumes his breast  While Spleen's dark power now sinks and now revives  At length the day th' important day arrives  Which in his breast must end the close debate  And fix the colour of SERENA's fate  Now comes the hour when the convivial Knight  Waits to begin the dinner's chearful rite  His fond heart ever with a Father's pride  Joys to behold his darling at his side  But most the absence of her smile he feels  In the gay season of his social meals  Hence while for her the rich repast attends  His hasty summons to the Nymph he sends  The happy Nymph superior cares induce  To risk his anger by a rash excuse  She craves his pardon but for time distrest  She still is busy on her magic vest  To range her diamonds in a sparkling zone  She begs to snatch her scanty meal alone  The Knight in sullen state begins to dine  Spleen like a Harpy flutters o'er his wine  Invisible she poisons every dish  Tinging with gall his mutton fowl and fish  The more he eats the more perverse he grows  For as his hunger sunk his choler rose  The cloth remov'd he cries with vapours sick  The Pears are mellow and the Port is thick  Tho' nicer fruit Pomona never knew  And his rich wine surpass'd the ruby's hue  A thousand times his dizzy brain revolves  A stern command now doubts and now resolves  To bid the Nymph descend and disarray'd  Quit her dear project of the Masquerade  As oft kind Nature to his heart recurr'd  And Love parental stopt the cruel word  Mean time unconscious of the brooding storm  The Nymph exults in her improving form  Gay is her smile as those the Queen of Love  Darts on the Graces in her court above  While they contrive with loveinspiring cares  New modes of beauty for the robe she wears  At length each duty of the toilet past  The glance of triumph on the mirror cast  Now the light wand our finish'd Ariel arms  Glad Jenny glories in her Lady's charms  And gives full utterance as she smooths her vest  To the sweet bodings of SERENA's breast  O lovely biass of the Female soul  Which trembling points to Pleasure's distant pole  Which with fond trust on flattering Hope relies  O'erleaps each peril that in prospect lies  And springing to the goal anticipates the prize  Such was SERENA's feardiscarding state  Her eye beheld not the dark frowns of Fate  She only saw the combat all forgot  The triumph promis'd as her glorious lot  Now eager to display her light attire  The sprightly Damsel seeks her sullen Sire  His gloomy brow with sportive air she kist  Ah how could Spleen that magic lip resist  That voice whose melting music might assuage  The scorpion Anger's selftormenting rage  For ne'er did Nature to a Sire's embrace  Present a filial form of softer grace  Or Fancy view a shape of lovelier kind  In the bright mirror of her Shakespeare's mind  The sulky Fiend in spite of all her art  Had now been banish'd from the Father's heart  But that resolv'd her utmost force to try  She summon'd to her aid her old ally  The fiery Demon tempertroubling Gout  Who sinks the lively and appalls the stout  Who now assisting Spleen's malignant aim  Shoots in quick throbbings through Sir GILBERT's frame  Thus sorely pester'd by a double foe  Galling his giddy brain and burning toe  The testy Knight with stern and sullen air  Denounc'd his humour to the shudd'ring Fair  "Go change your dress give up this vain delight  "I will not hear of Masquerades tonight  "Your Chaperone's inform'd she need not wait  "So change your dress and sit with me sedate"  As the proud dame whose avaricious glee  Built golden castles in the rich South Sea  Gaz'd on her Broker when he told her first  Her wealth was vanish'd and the bubble burst  So gaz'd the Nymph hearing her Sire destroy  Her airy palace of ideal joy  First her fond thoughts to flattering doubt incline  And deem the harsh command no fix'd design  But the quick sally of a peevish word  That Love revokes the moment it is heard  Or haply mirth in mimic wrath exprest  A feign'd forbiddance utter'd but in jest  To this short hope her sinking spirit clung  To see his softening eyes refute his tongue  Ah fruitless hope for there she cannot find  The wellknown signals of the friendly mind  Stern Contradiction with the frown of Fate  On his dark visage reign'd in sullen state  Felt in each feature in each accent shewn  Lower'd in his look and thunder'd in his tone  Hence the warm bosom of the lively Fair  Now shivers with the chill of blank despair  Now Disappointment's thick'ning shadows roll  A cloud of horror o'er the darken'd soul  And Fancy in a sick delirium tost  Gives double value to each pleasure lost  The blasted joys she labours to forget  Rush on her mind and waken keen regret  Her cheek turns palethe tear prepares to start  And palpitation heaves her swelling heart  But here SOPHROSYNE thy guardian aid  Saves from her potent foe the sinking Maid  Her bosom into strong emotions thrown  Now feels the pressure of thy friendly Zone  Swift thy kind cautions to her soul recur  More quick to cancel faults than prone to err  As the rough swell of the insurgent tides  By the mild impulse of the Moon subsides  So by her mystic Monitor represt  The flood of passion leaves her lighten'd breast  From her clear brain each cloudy vapour flies  And Joy's bright ray rekindles in her eyes  Reviving Gaiety full lustre spread  O'er all her features and with smiles she said  "Let others drive to Pleasure's distant dome  "Be mine the dearer joy to please at home"  Scarce had she spoke when she with sportive ease  Prest her Pianoforte's fav'rite keys  O'er softest notes her rapid fingers ran  Sweet prelude to the Air she thus began  SOPHROSYNE thou Guard unseen  Whose delicate controul  Can turn the discord of Chagrin  To Harmony of Soul  Above the lyre the lute above  Be mine thy melting tone  Which makes the peace of all we love  The basis of our own  So sung the Nymph not uninspir'd the Sprite  Invok'd so fondly in the mystic rite  With richest music swell'd her warbling throat  And gave new sweetness to her sweetest note  As when the seraph Uriel first begun  His carol to the newcreated Sun  The sacred echo shook the vast profound  And Chaos perish'd at the potent sound  So at the magic of SERENA's strain  Spleen vanish'd from her Sire's chaotic brain  Whose fibres lighten'd of that load rejoice  In the dear accents of her dulcet voice  Much he inclines his mandate to recall  And send the Fairone to the promis'd Ball  But stubborn Pride forbids him to revoke  The solemn sentence which Illhumour spoke  Still conscious of her power the Nymph prolongs  The soft enchantment of her soothing songs  Which his fond mind in firm attention keep  To his fixt hour of supper and of sleep  This now arriv'd the Knight retiring shed  A double blessing on his Darling's head  And with unusual exultation prest  His lovely Child to his parental breast  Thus while to rest the happy Sire withdrew  The Nymph more happy to her chamber flew  And Jenny now dismiss'd the grateful Fair  Breathes to her guardian Sprite this tender prayer  "Thou kind Preserver whose attentive zeal  "Gives me in this contented hour to feel  "That dearest pleasure of a soul refin'd  "The triumph of the selfcorrected mind  "If happy in the strength thy smiles impart  "I own thy favour in no thankless heart  "Still let me view thy form so justly dear  "Still in kind Visions to these eyes appear  "Thy friendly dictates teach me to fulfil  "And let thy aid avert each future ill"  While fond Devotion taught her thus to speak  The soft Down sinks beneath her lovely cheek  And settling on her lips that sweetly close  Silence enamour'd lulls her to repose  END OF THE SECOND CANTO  CANTO III  YE kind Transporters of the excursive soul  Ye Visions that when Night enwraps the Pole  The lively wanderer to new worlds convey  Escaping from her heavy house of clay  How could the gentle spirit foe to strife  Bear without you this coil of waking life  Its griefembitter'd cares its joyless mirth  And all the flat realities of earth  'Tis you sweet Phantoms who new powers inspire  Who give to Beauty charms to Fancy fire  When soaring like the eagle's kindred frame  The Poet dreams of everlasting Fame  Or tickled by the feather of the dove  The softer Virgin dreams of endless Love  There was a time when Fortune's bright decrees  Were seen to realize such dreams as these  Now dangerous visions the fond mind decoy  Vainly to hope for unexisting joy  While Belles and Bards with mournful sighs exclaim  Mortality has seiz'd both Love and Fame  Ah fair SERENA might the boast be ours  To clear from such a charge these heavenly Powers  Blest might thy Bard deserve in Fame to see  A guard as faithful as Love proves to thee  Blest if that airy Being gild his life  Who sav'd thee trembling on the brink of strife  And now kind prompter of thy nightly dream  Fill'd thy rapt spirit with her sacred beam  For soon as Slumber set thy soul at large  Thy Guardian Power revisited her charge  And lightly hovering o'er th' illumin'd bed  Thus with fond smiles of approbation said  "Well hast thou past sweet Maid one trying scene  "One fiery ordeal of the tyrant Spleen  "Thus my SERENA may thy force sustain  "Each harder trial that may yet remain  "Against the Fiend to fortify thy soul  "By useful knowledge of her dark controul  "I come to shew thee what no mortal eye  "Save thine was e'er permitted to descry  "The realms where Spleen's infernal agents goad  "The ghostly tenants of her drear abode  "Now summon all thy strength throw fear aside  "And firmly trust in thy aetherial Guide"  She spoke and thro' the Night's surrounding shade  The obedient Nymph not unappall'd convey'd  Thro' long long tracts of darkness on they past  With speed that struck the trembling Maid aghast  Till now recovering by degrees she found  Her soft foot press upon the solid ground  Encourag'd by her Guide at length she tries  To search the gloomy scene with anxious eyes  Per me si va nella citta dolente  Per me si va nell' eterno dolore  Per me si va tra la perduta gente  * * * * * * * * *  Lasciate ogni speranza voi ch' intrate  Queste parole di colore oscuro  Vid' io scritte al sommo d'una porta  DANTE Inferno  "Thro' me ye pass to Spleen's terrific dome  Thro' me to Discontent's eternal home  Thro' me to those who sadden'd human life  By sullen humour or vexatious strife  And here thro' scenes of endless vapours hurl'd  Are punish'd in the forms they plagued the world  Justly they feel no joy who none bestow  All ye who enter every hope forego"  O'er an arch'd cavern rough with horrid stone  On which a feeble light by flashes shone  These characters that chill'd her soul with dread  SERENA fixt in silent wonder read  As she began to speak her voice was drown'd  By the shrill echo of far other sound  Forth from the portal lamentable cries  Of wailing Infants without number rise  Compassion to this poor and piteous flock  Led the soft Maid still nearer to the rock  The pining band within she now espied  And touch'd with tender indignation cried  "How could these little forms of life so brief  "Deserve this dire abode of lasting grief"  "Well may thy gentle heart be sore concern'd  "At sight so moving" the mild Sprite return'd  "Thou seest in those whose wailings wound thy ears  "The puny progeny of modern Peers  "Their Sires by Avarice or Ambition led  "Aliens to Love approach'd the nuptial bed  "With proud indifference and with cold distaste  "Their homely brides reluctantly embrac'd  "And by such union gave disastrous birth  "To these poor pale incumbrances of earth  "Who bred in Vanity with Pride their dower  "Were Spleen's sure victims from their natal hour  "And in their splendid cradles pul'd and pin'd  "Till Fate their illspun thread of life untwin'd  "And to this vestibule convey'd their ghosts  "To form the vanguard of th' infernal hosts  "But let not Pity's ineffectual charm  "Impede thy progress or thy strength disarm  "Follow and fear not guarded by my care  "From all the phantoms that around thee glare"  She spoke and enter'd ere the Nymph replied  A pass that open'd in the cavern's side  Low dark and rockywith her body bent  SERENA follow'd down the dire descent  A sudden light soon struck her dazzled view  But 'twas a light of such infernal hue  As double horror to the darkness gave  With dread reflection from a dusky wave  Round a black water tatter'd spectres stand  With each a tiny taper in its hand  Fierce Mendicants who strive some alms to win  From the fair Wanderer with incessant din  The Guardian Spirit saw SERENA grieve  To hear of wants she knew not to relieve  And to the generous Nymph in pity cries  "The gulph of Indolence before us lies  "O'er whose dull flood to which no bank is seen  "A boat must waft thee to the dome of Spleen  "These pallid figures that around thee press  "And haunt thee with importunate distress  "On earth were Beggars of each different class  "Tho' blended here in one promiscuous mass  "The Poor who spurn'd kind Industry's controul  "The Rich who begg'd from penury of soul  "Both by their abject pride alike debas'd  "Blasphem'd that nature which they both disgrac'd  "And hither by the sullen Fiend convey'd  "Here still they ply their ineffectual trade  "In chase of each new passenger they run  "Condemn'd to beg from all to gain bynone  "But from these wretches turn thy fruitless care  "Behold the gulph before thee and beware  "Nor touch the stream which mortal sense o'ercomes  "And by its baleful charm the soul benumbs"  "Can mortal pass" the shudd'ring Nymph replied  "This sullen slow unnavigable tide  "In whose black current this enormous mound  "Of shapeless stone appears this horrid bound  "That seems an everlasting guard to keep  "O'er the dull waters that beneath it creep"  While yet she spoke with a resounding shock  Forth from the arch of the impending rock  Which o'er the murmuring eddy hung so low  The lazy river scarce had room to flow  Of rude construction and in roughest plight  A boat now issued to SERENA  's  sight  An empty boat that slowly to the shore  Advanc'd without the aid of sail or oar  Selfmov'd it seem'd but soon the Nymph beheld  A grifly figure who the stern impell'd  Wading behind the horrid Form appear'd  Above the water his strong arm he rear'd  And cross the creeping flood the crazy vessel steer'd  The heavenly Sprite observ'd her trembling Ward  Whose growing fears the hideous pass abhorr'd  And cheering thus she spake "This Spectre boasts  "The chief dominion of these dreary coasts  "To him thy Pilot without dread consign  "And place thy body in his bark supine  "So thro' this arching rock thou'lt pass alone  "Safe from the perils of th' incumbent stone  "Embark undauntedon the farther side  "Thou'lt surely find me thy unfailing Guide  "Nor let this Pilot raise thy groundless dread  "This sullen Charon of the froward dead  "A Phantom never blest with human life  "Tho' oft on earth his noxious power is rife  "And in that region ne'er from error free  "The words he dictates are assign'd to me  "Observe this Fiend that Nature scorn'd to frame  "Offspring of Pride and Apathy his name  "Passions he ne'er can feel and ne'er impart  "A miscreated Imp without a heart  "In place of which his subtle parent pinn'd  "A bladder fill'd with circulating wind  "Which seems with mimic life the mass to warm  "And gives false vigour to his bloated form  "But place thee in the boat his arms direct  "My love shall watch thee and my power protect"  So spake the friendly Sprite th' obedient Maid  Her form along the narrow vessel laid  But oh what terrors shake her tender soul  As from the shore the bark begins to roll  And sever'd from her Friend her eyes discern  The steering Spectre wading at the stern  Far stronger fears her resolution melt  Than those which erst the Bard of Florence felt  When by the honour'd shade of Virgil led  Thro' all the dreary circles of the dead  Hell's fiercest Demons threaten'd to divide  The living Poet from his shadowy Guide  Page  Stothard del Heath sculp  t    London Published Sept  r    st  by T Cadell Strand  And bade him friendless and alone return  Thro' the dire horrors of the dark sojourn  Not long the lovely Fairone's terrors last  For safely thro' th' impending rock she past  And slow advancing to the gloomy strand  The sullen Pilot brings her safe to land  There fondly hovering on her guardian plumes  The heavenly Monitor her charge resumes  And smiling leads along the rocky road  Whose windings open into Spleen's abode  Thou Queen of Shades whose spiritdamping spell  Too oft is seen the Poet's pride to quell  When the sharp workings of unrelish'd wit  Plunge thy pale victim in a bilious fit  May I unpunish'd by thy subtle power  Dare to display thy subterranean bower  And to this wond'ring upper world explain  The shadowy horrors of thy secret reign  Entering beneath a wide fantastic arch  Round the drear circuit of the dome they march  Which a pale flash from many a fiery Sprite  Frequent illumes with intermitting light  Such as on earth to Superstition's eye  Denounces ruin from the northern sky  While she discerns amid the nightly glare  Armies embattled in the blazing air  Around the Nymph unnumber'd phantoms glide  Here swell the bloated race of bulky Pride  In close and horrid union there appear  The wilder progeny of frantic Fear  Misshapen monsters whose stupendous frame  Abhorrent Nature has refus'd to name  Here in Cameleon colours lightly flit  The motley offspring of disorder'd Wit  All things prodigious the wide cave contain'd  And forms beyond what Fable ever feign'd  But as the worm that on the dewy green  Springs half to view and half remains unseen  Perceiving near its cell a human tread  Slinks back to earth and hides its timid head  So where the heavenly Spirit deign'd to lead  The startled spectres from her step recede  And as abash'd they from her eye retire  Sink into mist or melt in fluid fire  High on an ebon throne superbly wrought  With each fierce figure of fantastic thought  In a deep cove where no bright beam intrudes  O'er her black schemes the sullen Empress broods  The ShriekOwl's mingled with the Raven's plume  Shed o'er her furrow'd brows an aweful gloom  A garb that glares with stripes of lurid flame  Wraps in terrific pomp her haggard frame  Round her a Serpent as her zone is roll'd  Which writhing stings itself in every fold  Near her pavilion in barbaric state  Four Mutes the mandates of their Queen await  From sickly Fancy bred by sullen Sloth  Both parents' curse yet pamper'd still by both  First stands Disease an hag of magic power  Varying her frightful visage every hour  Her horrors heightening as those changes last  And each new form more hideous than the past  Detraction next a shapeless Fiend appears  Whose shrivell'd hand a misty mirror rears  Fram'd by malignant Art th' infernal toy  Inverts the lovely mien of smiling Joy  Robs roseate Beauty of attractive Grace  And gives a stepdame's frown to Nature's face  The third in place but with a fiercer air  See the true Gorgon Disappointment glare  By whose petrific power Delight's o'erthrown  And Hope's warm heart becomes an icy stone  Last in a gorgeous robe that ill bestow'd  Bows her mean body by its cumbrous load  Stands fretful Discontent of Fiends the worst  By dignity debas'd by blessings curst  Who poisons Pleasure with the sourest leaven  And makes a Hell of Love's extatic Heaven  The Guide celestial near this ghastly group  Perceiv'd her

and Pity now thy bosom steel  "For sights more horrible I now reveal  "Spleen's tortur'd victims view with dauntless eyes  "For lo her penal realms before thee rise"  The Nymph advancing saw with mute amaze  A dismal deep enormous dungeon blaze  Stones of red fire the hideous wall compos'd  And massive gates the horrid confine clos'd  Th' infernal Portress of this doleful dome  With fiery lips that swell'd with poisonous foam  Pale Discord rag'd with whose tormenting tongue  Thro' all its caves th' extensive region rung  A living Vulture was the Fury's crest  And in her hand a Rattlesnake she

hideous let us now repair"  Said the kind Guard of the dejected Fair  And cheering her faint Charge her step she led  To the near dwelling of the fretful dead  Of dusky adamant the dungeon rose  A dingy mirror its dark sides compose  Reflecting with a thousand quaint grimaces  The pale inhabitants' distorted faces  "Here like a Dame of Quality array'd  "Sits Peevishness presiding o'er the shade  "And frowning at her own uncomely mien  "Whose coarse reflection on the wall is seen  "A snarling Lapdog her righthand restrains  "Her lap an infant Porcupine contains  "Which while her fondness

soft cosmetics the griev'd Nymph applies  "Success attends her and the Freckle dies  "But ah this victory avails her not  "She finds an Hydra in the teazing spot  "Fast as one flies another still succeeds  "And with eternal food her fretful humour feeds  "Near to the Nymph in a more moody fit  "See the pale Phantom of a peevish Wit  "Mark with what frowns his eager eyes peruse  "Wet from the press three Critical Reviews  "With wounded Vanity's distracting rage  "How rapidly he runs thro' every page  "He finds some honours lavish'd on his Verse  "And Joy's faint gleams his gloomy spirit pierce  "But oh too soon these feeble sparks decay  "And keen Vexation reassumes her prey  "Hating reproof in every fibre sore  "One censur'd particle torments him more  "More than a hundred happier lines delight  "Which liberal favour condescends to cite  "But time will fail us if we pause to view  "The various torments of the testy crew  "These wretched chymists whose o'erheated brain  "Extracts from nothing a substantial pain  "Yet ere to different districts we advance  "Take of one fretful tribe a transient glance  "Their unsuspected punishments supply  "A lesson useful to the Female eye  "Spleen's liveliest agent here beguiles the gay  "Fair to attract and flattering to betray"  As thus the kind aetherial Guardian spoke  Within a rock whence plaintive murmurs broke  She touch'd a secret spring whose power was such  Two jarring doors unfolded at the touch  And with the charms of regal splendor bright  A chearful banquet sparkles to the sight  Viands so light so elegantly grac'd  Might tempt e'en Temperance herself to taste  For Fruits alone compos'd th' inticing treat  Fair to the eye and to the palate sweet  In such bright juice the Peach and Cherry swim

subtle Fiend  Who with a grace that every heart allures  Smiles on the lustre of her rich  liqueurs  Her fatal smiles their utmost power exert  To poison Beauty at her dire dessert  To blast the rose that Health's bright cheek adorns  And fill each festive heart with latent thorns  For the fly Fiend of every art possest  Steals on th' affection of her Female guest  And by her soft address seducing each  Eager she plies them with a Brandy Peach  They with keen lip the luscious fruit devour  But swiftly feel its peacedestroying power  Quick thro' each vein new tides of frenzy roll  All evil passions kindle in the soul  Drive from each feature every chearful grace  And glare ferocious in the sallow face  The wounded nerves in furious conflict tear  Then sink in blank dejection and despair  Effects more dire thus tempting to deceive  The Apple wrought not in the soul of Eve  Howe'er disguis'd in Jelly or in Jam  Spleen has no poison surer than a Dram  "But haste we now" the heavenly Leader cries  "To where this penal world's last wonder lies"  She spoke and led the Nymph thro' deeper dells  Lowmurmuring vaults and horrorbreathing cells  And now they pass a perforated cage  Where

Which issues on a vast and dreary plain  Fann'd by no breezes with no verdure crown'd  The black horizon is its only bound  And now advancing in a drizzly mist  Thro' sullen Phantoms hating to exist  SERENA spies high o'er his subjects plac'd  The ghastly Tyrant of the gloomy waste  Murmuring he sits upon a rocking stone  Th' unstable base of his illfounded throne  Hideous his face and horrible his frame  Misanthropy the grisly Monster's name  Him to fierce Pride with raging passion sore  The frowning Gorgon Disappointment bore  On earth detested and by heaven abhorr'd  Of this drear wild he reigns the moody lord  Few are the subjects of his waste domain  And scarce a Female in his frightful train  Except one changing corps of ancient Prudes  Reluctant here the prying band intrudes  Each who on earth behind her artful fan  Feign'd coarse aversion to the creature Man  Is doom'd in this dark region to abide  Some transient pains for hypocritic pride  Here everduring chains those Scoffers bind  Whose writings deaden and debase the mind  Who mock Creation with injurious scorn  And feel a fancied void in Plenty's horn  In his righthand an emblem of his cares  A branch of Aconite the Monarch bears  And those sour Phantoms who this region haunt  He feeds with berries from this deadly plant  For strange to tell tho' sever'd from its root  The bough still blackens with successive fruit  The tribes who taste it burst into a fit  Of raving mockery and rancorous wit  And pleas'd their Tyrant's ghastly smile to court  By vile distortions make him various sport  The frantic rabble who his sway confess  Before his throne an hideous Puppet dress  When in unseemly rags they have array'd  The image from their own dark semblance made  In horrid gambols round their work they throng  With antic dance and rude discordant song  Satire's rank offals on the block they fling  And call it Nature to delight their King  While in their features he exults to see  The frowns of Torture mixt with grins of Glee  For as these abject toils engage the crew  Their own grim idol darkens to their view  Wide and more wide its horrid stature spreads  And o'er the tribe new consternation sheds  For each forgets in his bewilder'd gaze  'Tis but a Monster which he help'd to raise  As o'er its form their dizzy glances roll  It strikes a chearless damp thro' all the soul  Vainly to shun the baleful sight they try  It draws for ever the reluctant eye  At each review with deeper dread they start  A colder chaos numbs each freezing heart  No mutual confidence no friendly care  Relieves the panic they are doom'd to bear  For as they shrink absorb'd in wild affright  When each to each inclines his wounded sight  They feel for social comfort sour disgust  And all the sullen anguish of distrust  "Now mark SERENA the mild Guide began  "The proudest Phantom of the gloomy clan  "Appointed by this surly Monarch's grace  "Highpriest of all his Misanthropic race  "See o'er the crowd a throne of vapours lift  "That strange and motley form the shade of SWIFT  "Now shalt thou view" the guardian Sprite pursues  "His horrid pennance that each day renews  "Perchance its terrors may o'erwhelm thy sense  "But trust my care to bear thee safely hence"  As thus she spoke above the gazing throng  High in a sailing cloud the Spectre swept along  Vain of his power of elocution proud  In mystic language he harangu'd the crowd  The bounds he mark'd with measure so precise  Of Equine virtue and of Human vice  That cursing Nature's gifts without remorse  Each sullen hearer wish'd himself a Horse  Pleas'd with the pure effect his sermon wrought  Th' ambitious Priest a rich Tiara caught  Which hovering o'er his highaspiring head  Sarcastic Humour dangled by a thread  The rich Tiara for his temples fit  Blaz'd with each polish'd gem of brilliant wit  And sharpfac'd Irony his darling Sprite  Who rais'd her patron to this giddy height  Fast on his brow the dangerous honour bound  But in the moment that her Priest was crown'd  His airy throne dissolv'd and thunder rent the ground  Forth from the yawning earth with lightning's speed  Sprang the fierce phantom of a fiery Steed  Spurring his sides whence bloody poison flow'd  The ghastlygrinning Fiend Derision rode  In her righthand a horrid whip she shakes  Whose sounding lash was form'd of knotted snakes  An uncouth bugle her lefthand display'd  From a grey monkey's skull by Malice made  As her distorted lips this whistle blew  Forth rush'd the Spectre of a wild Yahoo  See the poor Wit in hasty terror spring  And fly for succour to his grisly King  In vain his piercing cries that succour court  The grisly King enjoys the cruel sport  Behold the fierce Yahoo her victim caught  Drive her sharp talons thro' the seat of thought  That copious fountain which too well supplied  Perverted Ridicule's malignant tide  Quick from her steed the grinning Fiend descends  From the pierc'd skull the spleenful brain she rends  To black Misanthropy her ghastly King  See the keen Hag this horrid present bring  Her daily gift for as each day arrives  Her destin'd victim for new death revives  The Huntress now this direst pageant past  On her wild bugle blew so dread a blast  The sharp sound pierc'd thro' all the depths of Hell  The Fiends all answer'd in one hideous yell  And in a fearful trance the soft SERENA fell  Hence from the lovely Nymph her senses fled  Till thro' the parted curtains of her bed  The amorous Sun who now began to rise  Kist with a sportive beam her opening eyes  The opinion of some respectable Critics had almost led me to change the close of this Canto as containing too severe a censure on one of the great writers who have done most honour to our language And indeed when I reflect on the inimitable talents the public spirit and the charitable institutions of Swift I am almost ready to address his Spirit with this humiliating apostrophe  "I confess that I have done thee wrong"  But a superior attention to the interest of society inclines me to persevere in a very different sentiment and still to think that no talents no virtues in a writer can properly exempt even the most brilliant work from severe reprehension when instead of improving it has an evident tendency to debase and vilify human naturea tendency that I consider as most evident in the composition to which I have alludedif I am wrong in this idea I may yet shelter myself under the authority of two most honourable namesa moral Poet of a generous and exalted spirit and a learned Critic of infinite candour and discernmentIn Young's Essay on Original Composition and in the posthumous work just bequeathed to the public by the lamented Mr Harris the misanthropy of Swift is most warmly censured The words of the latter are so striking and apposite that I cannot wish for a stronger justification  "Misanthropy is so dangerous a thing and goes so far in sapping the very foundations of Morality and Religion that I esteem the last part of Swift's Gulliver that I mean relative to his Houyhnhnms and Yahoos to be a worse book to peruse than those which we forbid as the most flagitious and obscene One absurdity in this Author a wretched Philosopher though a great Wit is well worth remarkingin order to render the nature of Man odious and the nature of Beasts amiable he is compelled to give human characters to his Beasts and beastly characters to his Men so that we are to admire the Beasts not for being Beasts but amiable Men and to detest the Men not for being Men but detestable Beasts"  HARRIS's Philological Enquiries vol ii page  END OF THE THIRD CANTO  CANTO IV  HAIL thou enlighten'd Globe of human joy  Where social cares the soften'd heart employ  What cheering rays of vital

And gaze enchanted on thy flowery vale  Where smiling Innocence and ardent Youth  Sport hand in hand with Beauty and with Truth  Sport on sweet revellers in rosy bowers  Safe from th' intrusion of all evil Powers  Ah fruitless wish of the benignant Muse  Which to this chequer'd world the Fates refuse  For round its precincts many an ugly Sprite  Speeds undiscern'd to poison pure delight  Amidst the foremost of this haggard band  Unwearied poster of the sea and land  Wrapt in dark mists malignant Scandal flies  While Envy's poison'd breath the buoyant gale supplies  Tho' SHERIDAN with shafts of comic wit  Pierc'd and expos'd her to the laughing Pit  Th' immortal Hag still wears her paper crown  The dreaded Empress of the idle Town  O'erleaping her prerogative of old  To sink the noble to defame the bold  In chace of Worth to slip the dogs of Strife  Thro' all the ample range of public life  The Tyrant now that sanctuary burst  Where Happiness by Privacy is nurst  Her fury rising as her powers encrease  O'erturns the altars of domestic Peace  Pleas'd in her dark and galldistilling cloud  The sportive form of Innocence to shroud  Beauty's young train her baleful eyes survey  To mark the fairest as her favourite prey  Hence sweet SERENA while thy spirit stray'd  Round the deep realms of subterranean shade  This keenest agent of th' infernal Powers  On earth was busied in those tranquil hours  To blast thy peace and poison'd darts to aim  Against the honour of thy spotless name  For Scandal restless Fiend who never knows  The balmy blessing of an hour's repose  Worn yet unsated with her daily toil  In her base work consumes the midnight oil  O'er fiercer Fiends when heavy slumbers creep  When wearied Avarice and Ambition sleep  Scandal is vigilant and keen to spread  The plagues that spring from her prolific head  On Truth's fair basis she her falsehood builds  With tinsel sentiment its surface gilds  To nightly labour from their dark abodes  The Demons of the groaning Press she goads  And smiles to see their rapid art supply  Ten thousand wings to every infant lye  In triumph now behold the Hag applaud  He keen and fav'rite Imp ingenious Fraud  Her quick Compositor whose flying hand  Has clos'd the paragraph she keenly plann'd  No Nymph she nam'd yet mark'd her vile intent  That Dullness could not miss the name she meant  In Satire's tints the injur'd Fair she drew  In form an Angel but in soul a Jew  It chanc'd her Sire among his friends inroll'd  A wealthy Senator infirm and old  Who dup'd too early by a generous heart  Rashly assum'd a Misanthropic part  Tho' peevish fancies would his mind incrust  Goodnature's image lurk'd beneath their rust  And gay SERENA with that sportive wit  Which heals the folly that it deigns to hit  Would oft the sickness of his soul beguile  And teach the sullen humorist to smile  Pleas'd by her virtuous frolics to assuage  The mental anguish of distemper'd age  This ancient friend in a sarcastic sketch  Was mark'd by Scandal as a monied wretch  For whom the young yet mercenary Fair  Had subtly spread a matrimonial snare  With such base matter more diffusely wrought  The spiritpiercing paragraph was fraught  O'er which with glee the eye of Scandal glar'd  Which for the opening Press herself prepar'd  She on the types her inky wad let fall  And smear'd each letter with her bitterest gall  The Press whose ready gripe the charge receives  Stamps it successive on ten thousand leaves  Which pil'd in heaps impatient seem to lie  They only wait the dawn of day to fly  Now as the trembling child which long has laid  Mute in the dark and of itself afraid  When haply conscious of the pain it feels  The watchful mother to its pillow steals  Springs to her breast and shakes off all alarms  Feeling its safety in her fostering arms  With such quick joy in innocence as young  The soft SERENA from her pillow sprung  Pleas'd to awake from her  ific dream  And feel the chearful Sun's returning beam  Eager she rose in busy thought nor staid  The wonted summons of her punctual Maid  And as her own fair hands adjust her vest  The guardian Cincture flutters on her breast  For fondly when she wak'd or when she slept  Still round her heart th' important Zone she kept  Thou happy Girdle to thy charge be just  Firm be thy threads and faithful to their trust  For hours approach when all the stores they hide  Of magic virtue must be strongly tried  Now while her kind domestic heart intends  To please her early Sire the Nymph descends  But Sleep who left the Fair with sudden flight  With late wings hover'd o'er the good old Knight  And the chill circle of the lone saloon  Informs the shiv'ring Maid she rose too soon  'Tis true attentive John's unfailing care  Began the rites of breakfast to prepare  But yet no fires on the cold altar burn  No smoke arises from the silver urn  And the blank teaboard where no viands lay  Only supplied the Paper of the day  Tho' mild SERENA's peacedevoted mind  The keen debate of politics declin'd  And heard with cold contempt or generous hate  The frauds of Party and the lies of State  Nor car'd much more for Fashion's loose intrigues  Than factious bickerings or foreign leagues  Yet while she saunters idle and alone  Her careless eyes are on the Paper thrown  As some gay Youth whom sportive friends engage  To view the furious Ourang in his cage  If while amus'd he sees the monster grin  And trusts too careless to the bolts within  If the sly Beast as near the grate he draws  Tear him unguarded with projected paws  Starts at the wound and feels his bosom thrill  With pain and wonder at the sudden ill  So did SERENA start so wildly gaze  In such mixt pangs of anguish and amaze  Feeling the wound which Scandal had design'd  To lacerate her mild and modest mind  Startled as one who from electric wire  Unheeding catches unsuspected fire  She reads then almost doubts that she has read  And thinks some vision hovers round her head  Now her fixt eye some striking words confine  And now she darts it thrice thro' every line  Nor could Amazement more her senses shake  Had every letter been a Gorgon's snake  Now rising Indignation takes its turn  And her flush'd cheeks with tingling blushes burn  With restless motion and with many a frown  Thro' the wide room she paces up and down  Now musing makes a momentary stand  The fatal Paper fluttering in her hand  So the shy Bird by cruel sportsmen sprung  And by their random fire severely stung  Scar'd not disabled by the distant wound  Now trembling flies now skims along the ground  Now vainly tries in some sequester'd spot  From her gor'd breast to shake the galling shot  Ye tender Nymphs whose kindling souls would flame  Touch'd like SERENA's by injurious blame  O let your quick and kindred spirits form  A vivid picture of the mental storm  In which she labour'd and whose force to paint  The Muse's strongest tints appear too faint  In sympathetic thought her suffering see  But O for ever from such wrongs be free  Her faithful Girdle try'd its power to save  And oft a monitory impulse gave  Still unregarded still unfelt it prest  With useless energy her heaving breast  Her mind forgetful of the magic Zone  Full of the burning shaft by Scandal thrown  With blended notes of sorrow and disdain  Thus in disorder'd language vents its pain  "Had Malice dar'd my honour to defame  "The selfrefuted lie had lost its aim  "But here the world deceiv'd by sland'rous art  "Must think SERENA has a venal heart"  A venal heart at that detested sound  In swelling anguish her sunk voice was drown'd  Now was a fearful crisis of her fate  Distended now by Passion's growing weight  And for its Mistress fill'd with conscious dread  The magic Girdle crack'd thro' every thread  And snapp'd perchance by Scandal's force accurst  From her full heart the guardian Zone had burst  And spite of all the virtues of the Fair  The spell of Happiness had sunk in air  But that SOPHROSYNE whose friendly fear  Timely foresaw this trial too severe  An early succour gain'd from secret Love  From the fell Kite to snatch the falling Dove  As Nature studies in her wide domain  To blend some antidote with every bane  Thus her kind aid the friendly Power contriv'd  That from the quarter whence the wound arriv'd  There flow'd the anguish of that wound to calm  A soothing soft and medicinal balm  As in her agitated hand the Fair  Wav'd the loose Paper with disorder'd air  In capitals she saw SERENA flame  She blush'd she shudder'd as she view'd the name  Her ready fears subside in new surprize  And eager thus she reads with lighten'd eyes  "Go faithful Sonnet to SERENA say  "What charmspeculiar in her features reign  "A stranger whom her glance may ne'er survey  "Pays her this tribute in no flattering strain  "Tell her the Bard in Beauty's ample reign  "Has seen a virgin cheek as richly glow  "A bosom where the blue meandring vein  "Sheds as soft lustre thro' the lucid snow  "Eyes that as brightly flash with joy and youth  "And locks that like her own luxuriant flow  "Then say for then she cannot doubt thy truth  "That the wide earth no Female form can shew  "Where Nature's legend so distinctly tells  "In this fair shrine a fairer spirit dwells"  With curious wonder the reviving Maid  View'd this fond homage to her beauty paid  A second glance o'er every line she cast  And half pronounc'd and half suppress'd the last  While modest Pleasure and ingenuous Pride  Her burning cheek with deeper crimson dy'd  O Praise thy language was by Heaven design'd  As manna to the faint bewilder'd mind  Beauty and Diffidence whose hearts rejoice  In the kind comfort of thy cheering voice  In this wild wood of life wert thou not nigh  Must like the wandering Babes lie down and die  Page  Stothard del Sharp sculp  t    London Published Sept  r    st  by T Cadell Strand  But thy sweet accents wake new vital powers  And make this thorny path a path of flowers  As oil on Ocean's troubled waters spread  Smooths the rough billow to a level bed  The soothing Rhyme thus soften'd into rest  The painful tumult of SERENA's breast  Now to herself restor'd the conscious Maid  The lurking Fiend's insidious snare survey'd  Her nerves with grateful trepidation own  A slighter pressure from the faithful Zone  And in fond thought she breathes a thankful prayer  For her aetherial Guardian's constant care  Yet with a keen desire her bosom glow'd  To hear from whom the gentle Sonnet flow'd  But kind SOPHROSYNE who watch'd unseen  To shield her votary from the wiles of Spleen  As friendly Love had fixt a future time  When to reveal the secret of the Rhyme  Strove till that hour her fancy to restrain  Nor let her anxious wishes rise to pain  As Gaiety's fresh tide began to roll  East in the swelling channel of her soul  The good old Knight descends tho' eager slow  The Gout still tingling in his tender toe  And now paternal salutations past  His eyes he keenly on the Paper cast  While his sweet Daughter with attentive grace  Before him flies his ready cup to place  For Tea and Politics alternate share  In friendly rivalship his morning care  Tho' smooth as oil the Knight's goodhumour flows  When the mild breeze of pleasant fortune blows  Yet quick to catch the casual sparks of ire  Like oil it kindles into mounting fire  And fiercely now his flaming spirit blaz'd  While on those galling words he wildly gaz'd  Whose force had almost work'd into a storm  The gentler elements in Beauty's form  As the sarcastic sentence caught his view  Back from the board his elbowchair he drew  And by sharp stings of sudden fury prick'd  Far from his foot his gouty stool he kick'd  Fierce as Achilles by Atrides stung  He pour'd the stream of vengeance from his tongue  But ah those angry threats he deign'd to speak  Had sounds alas far differing from the Greek  Rage from his lips in legal language broke  Of Juries and of Damages he spoke  And on the Printer's lawdevoted head  He threaten'd deep revenge in terms most dread  Terms that with pain the ear of Beauty pierce  And oaths too rough to harmonize in verse  While thus the good old Knight with passion hot  His Toast neglected and his Tea forgot  The discord of the drama to increase  Now prim PENELOPE assails her Niece  For as Sir GILBERT now with choler dumb  Points her the period with his angry thumb  "Ah Brother" cries the stiff malignant crone  Her sharp eye swiftly thro' the sentence thrown  "Scandal could never rise to heights like this  "But from the manners of each modern Miss  "Had but my Niece less giddy and more grave  "Observ'd the prudent hints I often gave"  The honest Knight her vile conclusion saw  And quick curtail'd it with a testy "Pshaw"  Mean while the gentle Maid who heard the taunt  Survey'd without a frown her prudish Aunt  Far other thoughts employ'd her softer mind  To one sweet purpose all her soul inclin'd  How she might close th' unpleasant scene how best  Restore goodhumour to her Father's breast  Her airy Guardian with delight survey'd  These tender wishes in the lovely Maid  And to accomplish what her heart desir'd  Trains of new thought above her age inspir'd  As Venus on her son's enlighten'd face  Shed richer charms and more attractive grace  When issuing forth from the dissolving cloud  His bright form burst on the admiring croud  So kind SOPHROSYNE unseen supplies  A livelier radiance to SERENA's eyes  And ere she speaks to captivate her Sire  Touches her lips with patriotic fire  It chanc'd that toss'd upon a vacant chair  A volume of that Wit lay near the Fair  Whose value try'd by Fashion's varying touch  Once rose too high and now is sunk too much  The book which Fortune plac'd within her reach  Contain'd O CHESTERFIELD the liberal speech  In which thy spirit like an Attic Sage  Strove to defend the violated Stage  From fetters basely forg'd by Ministerial rage  From this the Nymph her useful lesson took  And thus began reclining on the Book  "If on this noble Lord we may rely  "Scandal is but a speck on Freedom's eye  "And Public Spirit then will rather bear  "The casual pain it gives by growing there  "Than by a rash attempt to move it thence  "Hazard the safety of a precious Sense  "And by the efforts of a vain desire  "Rob this lifedarting eye of all its fire  "Tho' the soft breast of Innocence may smart  "By cruel Calumny's corroding dart  "Yet would she rather ache in every nerve  "And bear those pangs she knows not to deserve  "Much rather than be made a senseless tool  "To aid the frenzy of tyrannic rule  "Or forge one dangerous bolt for Power to aim  "At sacred Liberty's superior frame"  As ancient Chiefs were wont of old to gaze  With eyes of tender awe and fond amaze  On the fair Priestess of the Delphic fane  When first she utter'd her prophetic strain  Entranc'd in wonder thus Sir GILBERT view'd  His child yet more inspir'd who thus pursu'd  "For me I own these lines with gall replete  "Shot thro' my simple heart a sudden heat  "But happier thoughts my rising rage represt  "And turn'd the pointless insult to a jest  "And O should Slander still new wrath awake  "Still may my Father for his Daughter's sake  "Disdain the vengeance of litigious strife  "And let SERENA's answer beher life"  She ended with a smile whose magic flame  Shot youthful vigour thro' her Father's frame  His Age his Anger and his Gout are fled  "Enchanting Girl" with tears of joy he said  "Enchanting Girl" twice echoed from his tongue  As speaking from his elbowchair he sprung  "Come to thy Father's armsBy Heaven thou art  "His own true offspring and a Whig in heart"  He spoke and his fond arms around her curl'd  With proud grasp seeming to infold the world  Her conscious heart she feels with triumph beat  And joys to find that triumph is compleat  For stiff PENELOPE who near them stood  "Albeit unused to the melting mood"  Squeez'd from her eyelid one reluctant tear  And soften'd with a smile her brow severe  But 'twas a smile of such a gloomy grace  As lighten'd once upon Alecto's face  When Orpheus past her leading back to life  From Pluto's regions his recover'd wife  When Love connubial join'd to Music's spell  Moisten'd with tender joy the eyes of Hell  Far other smiles with Pleasure's softest air  Gild the gay features of the youthful Fair  She looks like sportive Spring when her young charms  Wind round her hoary Sire's reluctant arms  And by a frolic infantine embrace  Banish the rugged frown from Winter's face  Thro' the long day she felt the glowing tide  Of exultation thro' her bosom glide  And oft she wish'd for slowapproaching Night  To hold sweet converse with her guardian Sprite  At length the hour approach'd her heart desir'd  And in her lonely chamber now retir'd  Her tender fancy gave the fondest scope  To ardent Gratitude and eager Hope  "Dear airy Being" the soft Nymph exclaim'd  "Whose power can break the spell that Spleen has fram'd  "Can by the waving of thy viewless wing  "O'er darkest forms a golden radiance fling  "And make in minds by sorriest thoughts perplext  "This moment's grief the triumph of the next  "I bless thy succour in each trial past  "Be present still and save me in the last"  Thus with her lovely eyes devoutly fixt  Where rays of hope and fear and reverence mixt  The tender Fair her faithful Guard addrest  Then with her cheek her downy pillow prest  But long her wakeful lids refuse to close  For Curiosity dispels repose  Her busy mind the mystic veil would pierce  That hides the Author of the pleasing Verse  Her lips involuntary catch the chime  And half articulate the soothing Rhyme  Till weary Thought no longer watch can keep  But sinks reluctant in the folds of Sleep  END OF THE FOURTH CANTO  CANTO V  WHY art thou fled O blest poetic time  When Fancy wrought the miracles of Rhyme  When darting from her starencircled throne  Her Poet's eye commanded worlds unknown  When by her fiat made a mimic God  He saw Existence waiting on his nod  And at his pleasure into being brought  New shadowy hosts the vassals of his thought  In Joy's gay garb in Terror's dread array  Darker than night and brighter than the day  Who at his bidding thro' the wilds of air  Rais'd willing mortals far from earthly care  And led them wondering thro' his wide domain  Beyond the bounds of Nature's narrow reign  While their rapt spirits in the various flight  Shook with successive thrills of new delight  Return sweet season grac'd with Fiction's flowers  Let not cold System cramp thy genial powers  Shall mild Morality in gard uncouth  The housewife garb of plain and homely Truth  Robb'd by stern Method of her rosy crown  Chill her

potent charms  And thou SOPHROSYNE mysterious Sprite  If haply I may trace thy steps aright  Roving thro' paths untrod by mortal feet  To paint for human eyes thy heavenly seat  Shed on my soul some portion of that power  Which sav'd SERENA in the trying hour  To bear those trials which however hard  As Bards all tell us may befall the Bard  The Fop's pert jest the Critic's frown severe  Learning's proud cant with Envy's artful sneer  And the vext Poet's last and worst disgrace  His cold blank Bookseller's rhymefreezing face  Hence ye dark omens that to Spleen belong  Ye shall not check the current of my song  While Beauty's lovely race for whom I sing  Fire my warm hand to strike the ready string  As Quiet now her lightest mantle laid  O'er the still senses of the sleeping Maid  Her nightly Visitant her faithful Guide  Descends in all her Empyrean pride  That Fairy shape no more she deigns to wear  Whose light foot smooths the furrow plough'd by care  In mortal faces while her tiny spear  Gives a kind tingle to the caution'd ear  Now in her nobler shape of heavenly size  She strikes her votary's soul with new surprize  Jove's favourite daughter arm'd in all his powers  Appear'd less brilliant to th' attending Hours  When on the golden car of Juno rais'd  In heavenly pomp the Queen of Battles blaz'd  With all her lustre but without the dread  Which from her arm the frowning Gorgon shed  SOPHROSYNE descends with guardian Love  To waft her gentle Ward to worlds above  From her fair brow a radiant diadem  Rose in twelve stars and every separate gem  Shot magic rays of virtue to controul  Some passion hostile to the human soul  Round her sweet form a robe of aether flow'd  And in a wonderous car the smiling Spirit rode  Firm as pure ivory it charm'd the sight  With finer polish and a softer white  The hand of Beauty with an easy swell  Scoop'd the free concave like a bending shell  And on its rich exterior Art display'd  The triumphs of the Power the car convey'd  Here in celestial tints surpassing life  Sate lovely Gentleness disarming Strife  There young Affection born of tender Thought  In rosy chains the fiercer Passions caught  Ambition with his sceptre snapt in twain  And Avarice scorning what his chests contain  Round the tame Vulture flies the fearless Dove  Soft Innocence embraces playful Love  And laughing Sport the frolic Child of Air  Buries in flowers the sinking form of Care  These figures pencil'd with a touch so light  That every image seem'd an heavenly Sprite  Breathe on the car whose sightenchanting frame  Four wheels sustain of pale and purple flame  For no fleet animals to earth unknown  Bear thro' aetherial fields this flying throne  As by the subtle electrician's skill  Globes seem to fly obedient to his will  So these four circles of instinctive fire  Move by the impulse of their Queen's desire  Mount or descend by her directing care  Or rest supported by the buoyant air  Now springing from her car that hovering staid  High in the chamber of the sleeping Maid  The Goddess with a voice divinely clear  Breath'd these kind accents in her Votary's ear  "Come my fair Champion who so well hast fought  "The useful battles of contentious Thought  "To aid thy gentle spirit to sustain  "The final conflict of thy destin'd pain  "View the rewards that in my realms of bliss  "Wait the sweet Victor in such war as this  "So haply may thy mind with strength renew'd  "The dark devices of the Fiend elude  "By one blest effort seal thy triumphs past  "And gain thy promis'd guerdon in the last"  As thus she spake her heavenly arms embrac'd  And in the car the conscious Maiden plac'd  Quick at her wish the flaming wheels ascend  No clouds impede them wheresoe'er they bend  As thro' the empire of the winds they rush'd  The winds were all in mute submission hush'd  And now SERENA from th' exalted car  Look'd down astonish'd on each sinking star  Flying o'er lucid orbs whose distant light  Yet has not reach'd the scope of human sight  And now not distant from the bounds of Space  The guardian Sprite suspends their rapid race  And while in deep amaze the Nymph admires  The circling meteor's inoffensive fires  Pleas'd at her wonder the mild Power addrest  With kind intelligence her earthly guest  "Of those three Orbs that in yon chrystal sphere  "A separate system in themselves appear  "The last whose luminous and steady form  "Shines softly bright and moderately warm  "Contains my palace and the gentle train  "Whom I have wafted to this pure domain  "At equal distance my dominions lie  "From these two larger worlds more near thine eye  "Observe their difference as our wheels advance  "And passing take of each a transient glance"  So speaking to the grosser globe she sprung  Her car suspended o'er its surface hung  In heavy air for round this orb was roll'd  A circling vapour dull and damp and cold  "Here" says SOPHROSYNE "those Beings dwell  "Who wanted soul to act or ill or well  "Who saunter'd thoughtless thro' their mortal time  "Without a Care a Virtue or a Crime  "Here still they saunter in this languid scene  "But pass the dozing crowd and mark their Queen"  And now slow riding on a Tortoise' back  Her features lifeless and each fibre slack  Full in their view the Nymph Indifference came  The quick SERENA soon perceiv'd her name  For as in solemn creeping state she rode  In her lax hand she held fair GREVILLE's Ode  Ne'er did the Muse from her sweet treasure cull  Incense so precious for a Power so dull  Still as she mov'd along her even way  The heavy Goddess try'd to read the lay  But at each pause her inattentive eye  Stray'd from the paper which she held awry  Nor could her lips a single line repeat  Tho' the soft Verse most ravishingly sweet  Thro' Time's dull ear will lasting pleasure spread  And charm the poppy from Oblivion's head  Thus like a City Mayor whose heavy barge  Steers its dull progress at the public charge  This Power so cumber'd by her empire's weight  Makes her slow circuit round her sluggish state  Around her tribes of rambling Sceptics crawl  Tho' moving dubious if they move at all  Before her languid Pomp her Marshal creeps  Whose hand her banner half unfolded keeps  Its quaint device her dull dominion spoke  An Eagle numb'd by the Torpedo's stroke  "Enough of scenes so foreign to thy soul"  SOPHROSYNE exclaim'd "from this dark goal  "Pass we to regions opposite to this"  She spoke and darting o'er the wide abyss  Her car like lightning in soft flashes hurl'd  Shot to the confines of a clearer world  Now lovelier views the Virgin's mind absorb  For now they hover'd o'er a lucid orb  Here the soft air luxuriously warm  Imparts new lustre to SERENA's form  Her eyes with more expressive radiance speak  And richer roses open on her cheek  Here as she gaz'd she felt in every vein  A blended thrill of pleasure and of pain  Yet every object opening to her view  Her quick regard with soft attraction drew  SOPHROSYNE who saw the gentle Fair  Lean o'er these confines with peculiar care  Smil'd at the tender interest she display'd  And spoke regardful of the pensive Maid  "Well may'st thou bend o'er this congenial sphere  "For Sensibility is Sovereign here  "Thou seest her train of sprightly damsels sport  "Where the soft Spirit holds her rural court  "But fix thine eye attentive to the plain  "And mark the varying wonders of her reign"  As thus she spoke she pois'd her airy seat  High o'er a plain exhaling every sweet  For round its precincts all the flowers that bloom  Fill'd the delicious air with rich perfume  And in the midst a verdant throne appear'd  In simplest form by graceful Fancy rear'd  And deck'd with flowers not such whose flaunting dyes  Strike with the strongest tint our dazzled eyes  But those wild herbs that tenderest fibres bear  And shun th' approaches of a damper air  Here stood the lovely Ruler of the scene  And Beauty more than Pomp announc'd the Queen  The bending Snowdrop and the Briarrose  The simple circle of her crown compose  Roses of every hue her robe adorn  Except th' insipid Rose without a thorn  Thro' her thin vest her heighten'd beauties shine  For earthly gauze was never half so fine  Of that enchanting age her figure seems  When smiling Nature with the vital beams  Of vivid Youth and Pleasure's purple flame  Gilds her accomplish'd work the Female frame  With rich luxuriance tender sweetly wild  And just between the Woman and the Child  Her fair left arm around a vase she flings  From which the tender plant Mimosa springs  Towards its leaves o'er which she fondly bends  The youthful Fair her vacant hand extends  With gentle motion anxious to survey  How far the feeling fibres own her sway  The leaves as conscious of their Queen's command  Successive fall at her approaching hand  While her soft breast with pity seems to pant  And shrinks at every shrinking of the plant  Around their Sovereign on the verdant ground  Sweet airy Forms in mystic measures bound  The mighty master of the revel Love  In notes more soothing than his mother's Dove  Prompts the soft strain that melting virgins sing  Or sportive trips around the frolic ring  Coupling with radiant wreaths of lambent fire  Fair fluttering Hope and rapturous Desire  Page  Stothard del Neagle sculp  Published at the Act directs by T Cadell Strand Feb  y    st    Unnumber'd damsels different charms display  Pensive with bliss or in their pleasures gay  And the wide prospect yields one touching sight  Of tender yet diversified delight  But the bright triumphs of their joy to check  In the clear air there hangs a dusky speck  It swellsit spreadsand rapid as it grows  O'er the gay scene a chilling shadow throws  The soft SERENA who beheld its flight  Suspects no evil from a cloud so light  For harmless round her the thin vapours wreath  Not hiding from her view the scene beneath  But ah too soon with Pity's tender pain  She saw its dire effect o'er all the plain  Sudden from thence the sounds of Anguish flow  And Joy's sweet carols end in shrieks of woe  The wither'd flowers are fall'n that bloom'd so fair  And poison all the pestilential air  From the rent earth dark Demons force their way  And make the sportive revellers their prey  Here gloomy Terror with a shadowy rope  Seems like a Turkish Mute to strangle Hope  There jealous Fury drowns in blood the fire  That sparkled in the eye of young Desire  And lifeless Love lets merciless Despair  From his crush'd frame his bleeding pinions tear  But pangs more cruel more intensely keen  Wound and distract their sympathetic Queen  With fruitless tears she o'er their misery bends  From her sweet brow the thorny Rose she rends  And bow'd by Grief's insufferable weight  Frantic she curses her immortal state  The soft SERENA as this curse she hears  Feels her bright eye suffus'd with kindred tears  And her kind breast where quick compassion swell'd  Shar'd in each bitter suffering she beheld  The guardian Power survey'd her lovely grief  And spoke in gentle terms of mild relief  "For this soft tribe thy heaviest fear dismiss  "And know their pains are transient as their bliss  "Rapture and Agony in Nature's loom  "Have form'd the changing tissue of their doom  "Both interwoven with so nice an art  "No power can tear the twisted threads apart  "Yet happier these to Nature's heart more dear  "Than the dull offspring in the torpid sphere  "Where her warm wishes and affections kind  "Lose their bright current in the stagnant mind  "Here grief and joy so suddenly unite  "That anguish serves to sublimate delight"  She spoke and ere SERENA could reply  The vapour vanish'd from the lucid sky  The Nymphs revive the shadowy Fiends are fled  The newborn flowers a richer fragrance shed  The gentle Ruler of the changeful land  Smiling resum'd her symbol of command  Replac'd the roses of her regal wreath  Still trembling at the thorns that lurk beneath  But to her wounded subjects quick to pay  The tender duties of imperial sway  Their wants she succour'd they her wish obey'd  And all recover'd by alternate aid  While on the lovely Queen's enchanting face  Departed Sorrow's faint and fainter trace  Gave to each charm a more attractive grace  Now laughing Sport from the enlighten'd plain  Clear'd with quick foot the vestiges of Pain  The gay scene grows more beautifully bright  Than when it first allur'd SERENA's sight  Still her fond eyes o'er all the prospect range  Flashing sweet pleasure at the blissful change  Her curious thoughts with fond attachment burn  Yet more of this engaging land to learn  She finds the chief attendants of the Queen  Sweet Females wafted from our human scene  But as it chanc'd while all the realm reviv'd  A Spirit masculine from earth arriv'd  Two airy guides conduct the gentle Shade  Genius in robes of braided flames array'd  And a fantastic Nymph in manners nice  Profusely deck'd with many an odd device  Sister of him whose luminous attire  Flashes with unextinguishable fire  Like him in features in her look as wild  And Singularity by mortals styl'd  The eager Queen and all her smiling Court  Surround the welcome Shade in gentle sport  For in their new associate all rejoice  All pant to hear the accents of his voice  Tho' o'er his frame th' Armenian robe was flung  The pleasing stranger spoke the Gallic tongue  But in that language his enchanting art  Inspir'd new energy that seiz'd the heart  In terms so eloquent so sweetly bold  A story of disastrous love he told  Convuls'd with sympathy the list'ning train  At every pause with dear delicious pain  Intreat him to renew the fascinating strain  And now SERENA with suspended breath  Listen'd and caught the tale of JULIA's death  And quick she cries ere tears had time to flow  "Blest be this hour for now I see ROUSSEAU"  Fondly she gaz'd till the enchanting sound  In such a potent spell her spirit bound  That lost in sweet illusion she forgot  The promis'd scenes of the sublimer spot  Till now her mild Remembrancer whose care  Stray'd not a moment from the mortal Fair  Rous'd her rapt mind preparing her to meet  The brighter wonders of her blissful seat  While her instinctive car's obedient frame  Now upward rose like undulating flame  As when some victor on the watery world  Bright honour gilding all his sails unfurl'd  Steers into port while to the laughing sky  His streamers tell his triumph as they fly  Expecting thousands line the crowded strand  Swell the glad voice or wave the joyous hand  Pressing to view the sight their vows implor'd  And hail their glory and their strength restor'd  So the blest Beings of this smiling scene  Flock'd round the car of their returning Queen  The radiant car from which they now alight  Careful she gives to a selected Sprite  A Nymph of snowy vest and lovely frame  Fidelity her fair and spotless name  Then happy to review her hallow'd home  Leads her sweet Guest to her celestial dome  Gentlest of Powers for every purpose fit  To strengthen Wisdom and embellish Wit  Thou whose soft arts possess'd by thee alone  Can give to Virtue's voice a sweeter tone  Allay the frost of Age or fire of Youth  And lend attraction to severest Truth  Improve e'en Beauty by thy graceful ease  Or teach Deformity herself to please  Inspire the Bard whose just ambition pants  To guide weak mortals to thy heavenly haunts  Grant him in notes that like thy soft controul  Allure attention and possess the soul  Grant him to shew in luminous display  The mystic wonders of thy secret sway  Now at the sight of the presiding Power  Wide spread the gates of a stupendous tower  On whose firm height commanding Nature's bound  The faithful warder of the fort they found  Wakeful Intelligence a trusty Sprite  Whose eyes are piercing as the solar light  And ever on the watch to sound alarm  If aught of dusky hue portending harm  Should in defiance of her mandate dare  Approach the palace of th' imperial Fair  Within his ward magnificently great  Lies the rich armoury that guards her state  Here stands Conviction's strong and lucid spear  Whose touch annihilates Suspense and Fear  Here Truth's unsullied adamantine shield  Which save SOPHROSYNE no Power can wield  And Reason's trenchant blade of blazing steel  Its edge and polish form'd by friendly Zeal  And not less sure their destin'd mark to hit  Pointed by Virtue's hand the shafts of Wit  And Ridicule's strong bolt whose stunning blow  Lays towering Vice and fearless Folly low  Here too the Goddess kept in mystic state  Those sweet rewards that on her champions wait  Guerdons more precious than triumphant palms  The glance of Gratitude for mental alms  Peace's soft kiss and Reconcilement's tear  And smiles of Sympathy are treasur'd here  These precincts past now hand in hand they came  To the rich fabric of majestic frame  Instinct with joy their Sovereign to behold  The gates of massive adamant unfold  And as the gentlymoving valves unclose  Mysterious music from their motion flows  The airy notes thro' all the palace roam  And dulcet echoes fill the festive dome  A gorgeous hall amaz'd SERENA's eyes  Compar'd to which in splendor strength and size  The noblest works of which Tradition sings  Judaic shrine or seat of Memphian kings  Would seem more humble than the waxen cell  In which the skilful Bee is proud to dwell  Here sits a Power in whose angelic face  Beauty is sweeten'd by maternal grace  Her radiant seat surpassing mortal art  Supports an emblem of her liberal heart  A Pelican who rears her callow brood  And from her vitals seems to draw their food  Around this Spirit flock a filial host  Who bless her empire and her guidance boast  Here every Science all the Arts attend  In her they hail their parent and their friend  Each to her presence brings the happy few  Whose dearest glory from her favour grew  Here in her simple charms with youthful fire  Proud to display the magic of her lyre  Soulsoothing Harmony presents her band  Beside her Orpheus and Amphion stand  Here mild Philosophys whose thoughtful frown  Is sweetly shaded by her olive crown  In all her attic elegance array'd  Strong to convince and gentle to persuade  To her whose breath inspir'd his every rule  Leads the blest Sire of the Socratic school  Each animating Bard and moral Sage  The heaventaught minds of every clime and age  Who soften'd manners and refin'd the soul  Flock to this presence as to Glory's goal  And as the mother's heart that yearns to bless  The rival innocents that round her press  Delights to see them as her love they share  Sport in her sight and flourish by her care  Fondly responsive to their every call  Tender of each and provident for all  So this sweet Image of Celestial Grace  Who sits encircled by her lovely race  To every Science vital strength imparts  And rears the circle of the Social Arts  With such solicitude she gives to each  Pow'rs of sublimer aim and wider reach  And now SOPHROSYNE who near her prest  Thus spoke her title to her earthly guest  "Behold the honour'd Form without whose aid  "My strength must vanish and my glory fade  "Source of my being and my life's support  "EUNOIA call'd in this celestial Court  "BENEVOLENCE the name she bears on earth  "The guard of Weakness and the friend of Worth"  She ended and the mild maternal Form  Embrac'd SERENA with a smile as warm  As the gay spirit Vegetation wears  When she to crown her favourite Nymph prepares  When pleas'd her flowery treasures to display  She pours them in the lap of youthful May  But how SERENA how may human speech  Thy heavenly raptures in this moment reach  If aught of earthly sentiment may vie  With the pure joy these happy scenes supply  'Tis when unmixt with trouble and with pain  Love glides in secret thro' the glowing vein  When some fond Youth unconscious of its fire  Free from chill Fear and turbulent Desire  With every thought absorb'd in soft delight  Sees all creation in his Fair one's sight  And feels a blissful state without a name  Repose of soul with harmony of frame  So plung'd in pleasure of the purest kind  SERENA gaz'd on the maternal Mind  Gaz'd till SOPHROSYNE's directing aid  Thus summon'd to new sights th' obedient Maid  "Haste my fair Charge for of this ample state  "Tracts yet unseen thy visitation wait  "The pressing hours forbid me to unfold  "Each separate province which these confines hold  "But I will lead thee to that blissful crew  "Whose kindred spirits best deserve thy view"  So speaking her attentive Guest she led  Thro' scenes that still increasing wonder bred  Where'er she trod thro' all her gorgeous seat  Soft music echoed from beneath her feet  Passing a portal on whose lucid stone  Emblems of Innocence and Beauty shone  They reach a lawn with verdant lustre bright  And view the bowers of permanent delight  No fiery Sun here forms a scorching noon  No baleful Meteor gleams no chilling Moon  But from a latent source one soothing light  Whose constant rays repel the mist of night  Tho' tender chearful and tho' warm serene  Gives lasting beauty to the lovely scene  No sensual thought this paradise profanes  For here tried Excellence in triumph reigns  Benignant cares eternal joy supply  And bliss angelic beams in every eye  "In yonder groups" the leading Spirit cried  "My fav'rite Females see my fairest pride  "The first in rank is that distinguish'd train  "Whose strength of soul was tried by Hymen's chain  "Tho' Beauty blest their form and Love their guide  "Their nuptial band with happiest omens tied  "Beauty and Love they felt may lose the art  "To fix inconstant Man's eccentric heart  "Yet conscious of their Lord's neglected vow  "No Virtue frown'd outrageous on their brow  "To keep returning Tenderness aloof  "By coarse upbraiding and despis'd reproof  "With Sorrow smother'd in Attraction's smile  "They strove the sense of misery to beguile  "And from wild Passion's perilous abyss  "Lure the lost wanderer back to faithful bliss  "See mild OCTAVIA o'er this band preside  "Voluptuous ANTONY's neglected bride  "Whose feeling heart with all a Mother's care  "Rear'd the young offspring of a rival Fair  "Far other trials rais'd yon lovely crew  "Tho' in connubial scenes their merit grew  "It was their chance ere judgment was mature  "When glittering toys the infant mind allure  "Following their parents' avaricious rule  "To wed with hopes of bliss a wealthy fool  "When Time remov'd Delusion's veil by stealth  "And shew'd the drear vacuity of wealth  "When sad Experience prov'd the bitter fate  "Of Beauty coupled to a senseless Mate  "These gentle Wives still gloried to submit  "These tho' invited by alluring Wit  "Refus'd in paths of lawless joy to range  "Nor murmur'd at the lot they could not change  "But with a lively sweetness unopprest  "By a dull Husband's lamentable jest  "Their constant rays of gay goodhumour spread  "A guardian glory round their idiot's head  "The next in order are those lovely Forms  "Whose patience weather'd all paternal storms  "By filial cares the mind's unfailing test  "Well have they earn'd these seats of blissful rest  "They unrepining at severe restraint  "Peevish commands and undeserv'd complaint  "Bent with unwearied kindness to appease  "Each fancied want of querulous Disease  "Gave up those joys which youthful hearts engage  "To watch the weakness of parental age  "Turn to this chearful band and mark in this  "Spirits who justly claim my realms of bliss  "Most lovely these when judg'd by generous Truth  "Tho' Beauty is not their's nor blooming Youth  "For these are they who in Life's thorny shade  "Repin'd not at the name of ancient Maid  "No proud disdain no narrowness of heart  "Held them from Hymen's tempting rites apart  "But fair Discretion led them to withdraw  "From the priz'd honour of his proffer'd law  "To quit the object of no hasty choice  "In mild submission to a Parent's voice  "The valued Lover with a sigh resign  "And sacrifice Delight at Duty's shrine  "With smiles they bore from angry spleen exempt  "Injurious mockery and coarse contempt  "'Twas their's to clasp each selfish care above  "A sister's orphans with parental love  "And all her tender offices supply  "Tho' bound not by the strong maternal tie  "'Twas their's to bid intestine quarrels cease  "And form the cement of domestic peace  "No throbbing joy their spotless bosom fir'd  "Save what Benevolence herself inspir'd  "No praise they sought except that praise refin'd  "Which the heart whispers to the worthy mind  "Such are these gentle tribes the happy few  "Who share the triumph to their victory due  "Angelic aims their spotless minds employ  "And fill their measure of unchequer'd joy  "Behold where some with generous ardor wait  "Around yon Seer who holds the book of Fate  "Those aweful leaves with eager glance they turn  "Thence with celestial zeal they fondly learn  "What dangers threaten thro' the vale of earth  "Their kindred pilgrims ere they rise to birth  "To earth they still invisibly descend  "In that dark scene congenial minds defend  "From Pleasure's Bud drive Spleen's corroding worm  "And in my votaries' heart my power confirm  "Delights more calm yon listening band employ  "Who deeply drink of intellectual joy  "See them around that speaking Nymph rejoice  "Their pleasures varying with her varied voice  "What graces in the sweet enthusiast glow  "Repeating here whate'er she learns below  "Memory her name her charge o'er earth to flit  "And cull the fairest flowers of human wit  "Whatever Genius in his happiest hour  "Has penn'd of moral grace and comic power  "To warm the heart the spells of Spleen unbind  "And pour gay sunshine o'er the misty mind  "Teach men to cherish their fraternal tie  "And view kind Nature with a filial eye  "This active Spirit catches in her flight  "Skill'd to retain and happy to recite  "Here she delivers each bright work and each  "Derives new beauty from her graceful speech  "Warpt by no envy by no love misled  "Equal she holds the living and the dead  "Alike rehearsing as they claim their turn  "The song of ANSTEY and the tale of STERNE  "But Morning calls thee henceYet one scene more  "My fostering love shall lead thee to explore  "This thy last sight with careful eyes survey  "And mark th' extensive nature of my sway"  Thus with fond zeal the guardian Spirit said  And to new precincts of her palace led  The scene she enter'd of her richest state  Where on her voice the subject Passions wait  Here rose a throne of living gems so bright  No breath could sully their benignant light  This her immortal seat the gracious Guide  Assum'd her Ward stood wondering at her side  Swift as they felt their ruling Power inthron'd  Aetherial Beings who her empire own'd  Crowded in glittering pomp the gorgeous scene  To pay their homage to their heavenly Queen  First came chaste Love whose sweet harmonious form  Ne'er felt Suspicion's soulconvulsing storm  No baleful arrow in his quiver lies  No blinding veil enwraps his sparkling eyes  There all the rays of varied joy unite  And jointly shed unspeakable delight  With him was Friendship like a virgin drest  The soft Asbestos form'd her simple vest  Whose wond'rous folds in fiercest flames entire  Mock the vain ravage of consuming fire  Around this robe a mystic chain she wore  Each golden link a star of diamonds bore  Force could not tear the finish'd work apart  Nor Int'rest loose it by his subtlest art  But strange to tell if the presiding Power  Who to her Favourite gave this precious dower  If kind SOPHROSYNE could fail to breathe  Her vital virtue on this magic wreath  The parts must sever faithless to their trust  The gold grow dross and every diamond dust  These Valour follow'd deck'd with verdant palm  Gracefully bold majestically calm  A mingled troop succeed with festive sound  Wisdom with olive Wit with feathers crown'd  Here hand in hand they move no longer foes  Their charms encreasing as their union grows  Pure Spirits all who hating mental strife  Exalt creation and embellish life  All here attend and in their Sovereign's praise  Their circling forms the song of glory raise  The blest SERENA drinks with ravish'd ear  The melting music of the tuneful sphere  Now in its close the soothing echoes roll  O'er her rapt fancy and intrance her soul  Her senses sink in soft Oblivion's bands  Till faithful Jenny at her pillow stands  Recalls each mental and corporeal power  While she proclaims aloud the passing hour  And in a voice expressive of surprize  Too shrill to seem the music of the skies  Informs the startled Fair 'tis time to rise  END OF THE FIFTH CANTO  CANTO VI  BLEST be the heart of sympathetic mould  Whatever form that gentle heart infold  Whose generous fibres with fond terror shake  When keen Affliction threatens to o'ertake  Young artless Beauty as alarm'd she strays  Thro' the strange windings of this mortal maze  To such SERENA be thy story known  Whose bosom best can make thy lot their own  And kindly sharing in thy trials past  Attend with sweet anxiety the last  The hour approaches the tremendous hour  In whose dark moments deeper perils lower  Still so enwrapt in Pleasure's gay disguise  They lurk invisible to Caution's eyes  And unsuspected by the Fair one wait  To cancel or confirm her blissful fate  Her lively mind with bright ideas stor'd  She takes her station at the Breakfastboard  Still her soft soul the heavenly Vision fills  And sweeter graces in her smile instils  New hopes of triumph glide thro' every nerve  And arm her glowing heart with firm reserve  Conscious the final trying chance impends  To bear its force her every power she bends  In her quick thought ambitious to presage  How Spleen's dark agents may exert their rage  She ponders on what perils may befall  And fondly deems her mind a match for all  Ah lovely Nymph this dangerous pride forego  Pride may betraySecurity's thy foe  While fancied Prudence thus a foreign guest  Sits doubly cherish'd in SERENA's breast  Behold a billet her attention steal  No common arms compose its ample seal  Th' unfolding paper breathes a roseate scent  Sweet harbinger of joy its kind intent  Of courteous FILLIGREE it bears the name  Clear symptom of the Peer's increasing flame  The gracious Earl lamenting pleasure lost  And fair SERENA in her wishes crost  Has plann'd in honour of the lovely Maid  A fancied Ball a private Masquerade  And supplicates her Sire with warm esteem  To smile indulgent on the festive scheme  All arts he uses to insure the grant  Nor leaves unask'd the eager maiden Aunt  Quick at the sound SERENA's glowing heart  Throbs with gay hopes but soon those hopes depart  Reflection in her soul a faithful guard  The opening avenues of pleasure barr'd  She deem'd the plan of this delightful show  But the new ambush of her secret foe  The bliss too bright to realize she guess'd  And chas'd th' idea from her guarded breast  While these discreet resolves her thought employ  Tranquil she triumphs o'er her smother'd joy  Not so the Knightto his parental eyes  In dazzling pomp delusive visions rise  That Coronet the object of his vow  He sees suspended o'er his daughter's brow  Eager he burns to snap the pendent thread  And fix the glory on his Darling's head  Far wiser aims the ancient Maiden caught  No empty gewgaw flutters in her thought  But while more keenly she applauds the plan  Her hope is solid and substantial Man  Not for her infant Niece whose baby frame  She holds unfit for Hymen's holy flame  But for her riper self whose strength may bear  The heaviest burden of connubial care  Tho' different Phantoms dance before their sight  Niece Aunt and Father in one wish unite  To join the banquet is their common choice  The business past with no dissenting voice  And the warm Sire in whom ambition burn'd  A note of grateful courtesy return'd  His billet seal'd the glad goodhumour'd Knight  Launch'd forth like Nestor on his youthful might  "O could I now in spite of age retain  "That active vigour and that sprightly vein  "Which led me once the lively laugh to raise  "Among the merrier Wits of former days  "When rival Beauties would around me throng  "And gay Ridottos listen to my song  "Such were I now as on the festive night  "When Chh's charms amaz'd the public sight  "When the kind Fair one in a veil so thin  "That the clear gauze was but a lighter skin  "Mask'd like a virgin just prepar'd to die  "Gave her plump beauties to each greedy eye  "On that fam'd night for then with frolic fire  "Youth fill'd my heart and Humour strung my lyre  "Pleas'd in the sunshine of her smile to bask  "I danc'd around her in a Devil's mask  "And idly chaunted an infernal ode  "In praise of all this Female tempter shew'd  "The jocund crowd who throng'd with me to gaze  "Extoll'd my unpremeditated lays  "And Sport who still of this old revel brags  "    See Nestor's Speech in the th Iliad  Styl'd her the first of Maids and me of Wags  "Then a light Devil now reduc'd to limp  "I am but fit to play the hagborn Imp  "Still not to cross the frolic of this Ball  "Still as the Tortoise Caliban I'll crawl  "And if with Gout my burning ankles flinch  "I'll call it Prospero's tormenting pinch  "Still in this shape I'll shew them what I am  "And PEN shall go as Sycorax my dam"  So spoke the Knight and spoke with so much weight  The listening Females saw his word was fate  For ne'er did Jove with so resolv'd a brow  To smiling Love his joyous scheme avow  When he concerted for his special mirth  A masquerading on the stage of earth  And of the Swan's soft plume or Bull's rough hair  Order'd the Fancydress he chose to wear  From whence let sapient Antiquarians shew  The ancient use of Masquerades below  SERENA smil'd to see this joyous fire  Infuse new youth in her determin'd Sire  But mute PENELOPE with half a sigh  "With one auspicious and one dropping eye"  Heard the firm Knight his fixt resolve impart  Tickling at once and torturing her heart  The Ball she relish'd but abhorr'd the task  To hide her beauties in a Beldam's mask  Miranda's name would better suit her plan  A simple Maiden not afraid of Man  But us'd alas her Brother's law to feel  She knows that law admits not of repeal  Trusting her charms will any garb enrich  She deigns to take the habit of a Witch  Never did Sorceress in the shades of night  Try to illuminate a filthy Sprite  With fonder efforts or with worse success  Than PEN now labour'd in this wayward dress  To give the sprightly shew of living truth  To the poor ghost of her departed youth  As Witches o'er their magic cauldron bend  Anxious to see their menial Imps ascend  So in her glass the ancient Maiden pries  And dreams new graces in her person rise  No such delights whose dear delusions please  The mild SERENA in her mirror sees  She at whose toilet Beauty's latent Queen  Attends enchanted with her filial mien  And o'er her Favourite's unconscious face  Breathes her own roseate glow and vivid grace  She hastes her glittering garments to adjust  With all the modest charms of sweet distrust  Doubting that beauty which she doubts alone  Which dazzles every eye except her own  The native diffidence which sway'd her mind  Now feels new terrors with its own combin'd  The robes of Ariel to the Nymph recall  Those disappointments that may yet befall  As her fair hands the gauze or tissue touch  They fondly warn her not to hope too much  She feels the friendly counsel they impart  And Caution reigns protector of her heart  The fateful evening comesthe coach attends  And first the gouty Caliban ascends  Then in Deformity's wellsuited pride  Sour Sycorax is station'd by his side  And last with sportive smiles divinely sweet  Light Ariel perches on the vacant seat  Fancy now paints the scene of pleasure near  Yet fluttering Gaiety is check'd by Fear  Her wish to view the festive sight runs high  But the fond Nymph remembers with a sigh  From Hope's keen hand the cup of joy may slip  And fall untasted though it reach the lip  As the fine Artist whose nice toils aspire  To fame eternal by encaustic fire  If he with grief has seen the faithless heat  Mar the rich labour it should make compleat  When next his hands with trembling care confide  To the fierce element his pencil's pride  Watches unceasing the pernicious flame  Terror and Hope contending in his frame  While his fair work the dangerous fire sustains  Feels it in all his sympathetic veins  And at each trivial sound that Chance may cause  Hears the Gem crack and sees its cruel flaws  With such solicitude the panting Maid  Past the long street of every noise afraid  Now while around her rival flambeaus flare  And the coach rattles thro' the crowded square  She fears some dire mischance must yet befall  Some Demon snatch her from the promis'd Ball  And dreams no trial more severe than this  So bright she figures the new scene of bliss  Yet horrid as it seems her heart is bent  To bear e'en this and bear it with content  But whirl'd at length within the Porter's gate  She thinks what perils at the Ball may wait  And as she now alights the fluttering Fair  Invokes her Guardian to protect her there  Till thoughts of danger thoughts of caution fly  Before the magic blaze that meets her eye  Th' advancing Nymph at

hide his fond intent  And in dissembled Passion's flowery tropes  To sport at leisure with the Virgin's hopes  For this he fram'd a motley speech replete  With amorous compliment and vain conceit  The labour'd nothing with complacent pride  He spoke but to his speech no Nymph replied  Page  Stothard del Sharp sculp  London Publish'd Sept  r    st  by T Cadell Strand  For in the moment the lost Fair devotes  Her willing ear to more attractive notes  The Minstrel happen'd near the Nymph to walk  Rapt with a bosomfriend in secret talk  And at the instant when the Earl began  Half to unfold his matrimonial plan  EDWIN in whispers from the crowd retir'd  Chanc'd to repeat the Sonnet she inspir'd  The sounds tho' faint her recollection caught  Drew her quick eye and fixt her wondering thought  Lost in this sweet surprize she could not hear  A single accent of the amorous Peer  Spleen saw the moment that she sought to gain  And perch'd triumphant on the Noble's brain  With jealous Envy stung and baffled Pride  "Contemptuous Girl" with sudden rage he cried  "If here to happier Youths thy views incline  "I want not fairer Nymphs who challenge mine  "Thy breast in vain with penitence may burn  "But once neglected I no more return"  Thus loudly speaking with distemper'd heat  Rudely he turn'd with rancorous scorn replete  SERENA startled at th' injurious sound  Survey'd th' insulting Peer who sternly frown'd  Shame and resentment thro' her bosom rush  Swell every vein and raise the burning blush  Love newborn Love but in its birth conceal'd  Nor to the Nymph herself as yet reveal'd  And just Disdain and Anger's honest flame  With complicated power convulse her frame  Contending Passions every thought confound  And in tumultuous doubt her soul is drown'd  Now treacherous Pride who tempts her tongue to trip  Forms to a keen reply her quivering lip  Insidious Spleen now hovers o'er the Fair  Deems her half lock'd within her hateful snare  In her new slave preparing to rejoice  To taint her spirit and untune her voice  Hapless SERENA what can save thee now  The Fiend's dark signet stamps thy clouded brow  In thy swoln eye I see the starting drop  This fatal shower aetherial Guardian stop  Haste to thy votary haste her soul sustain  Nor let the trials she has past be vain  Ah me while yet I speak with shuddering dread  I hear the magic Girdle's bursting thread  This horrid omen ye kind Powers avert  Nor thou bright Zone thy brighter Charge desert  Ah fruitless prayer her panting breast behold  See the gauze shakes in many a ruffled fold  Forc'd from their station by her heaving heart  From the strain'd Girdle thrice three spangles start  Thro' her disorder'd dress a pass they've found  And fallen see they glitter on the ground  O blessed chance with liferecalling light  The glittering monitors attract her sight  Like stars emerging from the darken'd pole  They sparkle safety to her harrass'd soul  See from her brow the clouds of trouble fly  Vexation's tear is vanish'd from her eye  Her rosy cheeks with Joy's soft radiance burn  Like Nature smiling at the Sun's return  The Nymph no more with mental darkness blind  Shines the sweet Ruler of her rescu'd mind  Hence hateful Spleen thy fancied prize resign  Renounce for ever what shall ne'er be thine  For conscious of her airy Guardian's aid  She feels new spirit thro' her heart convey'd  And inly blessing this victorious hour  Her soul exults in its recover'd power  In such mild terms she hails th' insulting Peer  As Spleen if mortal must expire to hear  But driven for ever from the lovely Girl  The foul Fiend riots in the captive Earl  He answers not but with a sullen air  On happier EDWIN who approach'd the Fair  Darts such a glance of rage and envious hate  As Satan cast on Eden's blissful state  When on our Parents first he fixt his sight  And undelighted gaz'd on all delight  So doom'd to look and doom'd such pangs to feel  Scornful he turn'd on his elastic heel  "O lovely Mildness oh angelic Maid  "Deserving homage tho' to scorn betray'd  "Rise still sweet Spirit rise these wrongs above  "Turn from injurious Pride to faithful Love  "Tho' on my brow no Coronet may shine  "Wealth I can offer at thy beauty's shrine  "And worthier thee a heart that worships thine"  Thus with newkindled Love's aspiring flame  Spoke the fond Youth conceal'd by EDWIN's name  The gallant FALKLAND rich in inborn worth  By Fortune blest and not of abject birth  Warmly he spoke with that indignant heat  With which the generous heart ne'er fails to beat  When Worth insulted wakens virtuous ire  And injur'd Beauty sets the soul on fire  Quick to his voice the startled Virgin turn'd  With wonder hope and joy her bosom burn'd  With sweet confusion flurried and amaz'd  On his attractive form she wildly gaz'd  Full on her thought the friendly visions rush'd  Blushing she view'd him view'd him still and blush'd  And soft Affection quickening at the sight  Perchance had swoon'd with fullness of delight  But that her Father's voice with quick controul  Recall'd the functions of her fainting soul  When on the distant seat where fondly fixt  He view'd the Nymph as in the dance she mixt  He indistinctly heard with wounded ear  The spleenful outrage of the angry Peer  Swift at th' imperfect sound with choler wild  He sprung to succour his insulted Child  But ere his fury into language broke  Love calm'd the storm that Arrogance awoke  The sudden burst of FALKLAND's tender flame  His winning manners his distinguish'd name  His liberal soul by Fortune's smile carest  All join'd to harmonize the Father's breast  His fiery thoughts subside in glad surprize  And to the generous Youth he warmly cries  "Ingenuous FALKLAND by thy frankness won  "My willing heart would own thee as my Son  "But on thy hopes SERENA must decide  "Haste we together from this house of Pride"  So spoke the Sire for to her Votary kind  SOPHROSYNE inspir'd his soften'd mind  Speaking

Has drawn too vent'rous near the freezing pole  Who having slighted Caution's tame advice  Seems wedg'd within impervious worlds of ice  If from each chilling form of peril free  At length he reach

intended only for a private theatre I have been tempted by that circumstance to introduce a kind of novelty into our language by writing three comedies in rhyme though the Comic Muse of our country has been long accustomed to express herself in prose and her custom has the sanction of settled precept and successful example The Antiquarian indeed may remind me that Gammer Gurton's Needle one of the earliest of our old plays with other comic productions of that rude period was written in rhyme and possibly some fastidious enemies of that Gothic jingle as they affect to call it may consider the present Publication as nothing more than a relapse into the most barbarous mode of dramatic composition  For the boldness of an attempt which has no modern precedent to plead in its behalf some apology may be due to the Public  In the first place I beg it may not be supposed that by writing a comedy in rhyme I mean to convey an indirect  censure on the contrary practice No one can prize more highly than I do the many excellent comedies in prose with which our language is enriched I am very far from entertaining a wish to overturn the ceremonial which the Comic Muse of England has established but I hope to find our country as much a friend to toleration in the forms of literature as in those of religion The custom of other enlightened nations both ancient and modern may be pleaded on this occasion in behalf of verse Aristophanes in his play of the Clouds seems to pride himself on his poetry Ariosto having written two comedies in prose converted them both into metre at a maturer period of his life and Moliere the unrivalled master of the French comie theatre who has written admirably both in prose and rhyme is I think most admirable and most truly comic when he adheres to the latter  To the author who attempts a comedy in English rhyme our language seems to offer an advantage which the French poet did not enjoy The Comic Muse of France has chiefly confined herself to that structure of verse which belongs equally to her Tragic Sister In the poetry of our nation this particular measure is appropriated to sportive subjects and though hitherto not used in Comedy it possesses to an English ear a very comic vivacity That it is highly calculated for poems of wit and humour we have a striking proof in that  most exquisite production the Bath Guide How far it may succeed through the varied scenes of an English play experiment only can determine As some readers on the first sight of a comedy in rhyme may hastily suppose that the fashion and the materials of the work are borrowed from the Theatre of France I think it proper to declare in justice to the writers of that country that they are by no means answerable for any defects which may be found in these dramatic performances I am not conscious of having borrowed a single character or situation from any comic writer whatever either foreign or domesticThe first of the three comedies contained in the present Publication was founded on a real anecdote related to me by an intimate friend who concealing the names of the parties mentioned their ludicrous adventure as a new and tempting subject for the Comic MuseThe plan of the second arose in the mind of its author from his remarking the various effects of Connoisseurship in different characters An attachment to the fine arts which is allowed to refine and strengthen the virtues of a manly and a generous spirit has perhaps a peculiar tendency not only to shew but to increase the narrowness of a vain and feeble mind and if such a tendency exists it is the province of a comic writer to counteract and correct itThe aim of the third comedy in this collection is to laugh at two distinct species of affectation  very prevalent in our age and country the affectation of refined sentiment and the affectation of pompous and pedantic expression I protest however against personal application and to guard against it let me declare that this ridicule is levelled not at the great and respectable Veteran in the field of literature whose phrases may sometimes be borrowed by a character in the play but at the nameless and servile herd of his awkward imitatorsVigor and originality of thought give a sanction to the pomp and peculiarity of his language If singularities of style are united with genius and moral excellence they are properly regarded with a partial respect but when these singularities are preposterously copied and seem to prevail as a fashion they become I apprehend very fair subjects of sportive satire  When I reflect what long and established prejudice a rhyming play must encounterwhen I remember that even Dryden himself the most able advocate and the greatest master of rhyme in our language has expressly condemned the use of it in comedyI am alarmed at the hardiness of my attempt but when I recollect that time the most infallible test of literary opinion has fully shewn the mistake of that immortal Poet in recommending the use of rhyme in English Tragedy I am inclined to hope that he might be equally mistaken in supposing it utterly unsuited to our Comic Muse It may be urged indeed with great truth that a comedy  in rhyme cannot be so close a copy of Nature as a comedy in prose the latter adhering to the very language of common life But from a sisterart we may borrow at least a plausible argument in favour of Poetry on the present occasion The great master who has descanted so happily on the principles of Painting observes with great propriety in one of his discourses that  "we are not always pleased with the most absolute possible resemblance of an imitation to its original object cases may exist in which such a resemblance may be even disagreeable I shall only observe that the effect of figures in waxwork though certainly a more exact representation than can be given by painting or sculpture is a sufficient proof that the pleasure we receive from imitation is not increased merely in proportion as it approaches to minute and detailed reality we are pleased on the contrary by seeing ends answered by seeming inadequate means  Sir Joshua Reynolds' Discourse of December  "  On these principles which perhaps are equally just in the two kindred arts a comedy in Rhyme may be still more entertaining than a comedy of equal merit in other points which confines itself to prose and a critic who exclaims against the unnatural effect of a rhyming dialogue may as justly censure a portrait on canvass because it is not so exact a copy of life as an image of coloured wax In both cases the artist whether painter or poet may be  justly called a true and a pleasing copier of Nature if he preserves as high a degree of resemblance as his mode of imitation will admit and embellishes his work with the attractive and almost indispensable graces of ease spirit and freedom  It is said by Voltaire of theatrical composition in general  "Tous les genres sont bons hors le genre ennuyeux"  If the present comedies fall not within the class which that lively Writer has so justly proscribed the Author may be allowed to hope that his liberal and enlightened readers will look with indulgence on a Publication which arose from his wish to introduce a striking and he trusts not a blamable variety into the amusements of English literature  THE HAPPY PRESCRIPTION OR THE

FELIX her Cousin and Wife to the COLONEL  JENNY Servant to SELINA  Servants  of  SIR NICHOLAS  c  SCENE  the Country Mansion of the  ODDFISH  Family  THE HAPPY PRESCRIPTION  ACT I  SCENE I  Enter  Sir Nicholas  in debate with  Mrs Felix  and  Selina  MRS FELIX  WHAT a strange declarationit gives me the spleen  But 'tis what good Sir Nicholas never can mean  SIR NICHOLAS  Not mean it fair Ladyby Jupiter yes  And my project you'll see will be crown'd with success  I am joyous myself and 'tis ever my plan  To give those I love all the joy that I can  MRS FELIX  We own itbut joy is like diet dear Cousin  One palate mayn't relish what pleases a dozen  Nor will I allow that my appetite's vicious  If perchance I don't like what you think most delicious  SIR NICHOLAS  Rare dainty distinctionsBut can I believe  That a woman e'er liv'd since the wedding of Eve  Whose heart tho' most coyly her head might be carried  Did not fervently wish to be speedily married  Not to wound your nice ears with the name of desires  Which youth renders lovely and nature inspires  Your sex from its weakness demands a defender  Whom pride and affection make watchful and tender  And if my fair Coz is no hypocrite grown  The truth of my maxims you'll honestly own  While the wars from your arms the brave Colonel detain  Is the want of a husband the source of no pain  MRS FELIX  There indeed you have touch'd me a little too near  My Soldier you know to my soul is most dear  I ownand my frankness you never will blame  I'd purchase his presence with aught but his same  SIR NICHOLAS  Well said thou dear honest and warmhearted wife  For thy truth may good angels still watch o'er his life  And while others the rough field of slaughter are treading  Send him home full of glory to dance at our wedding  For a wedding we'll have to enliven us all  And Hymen's bright altar shall warm the old hall  For my Niece ere I die 'tis my wish to provide  And ere two months are past I  will  see her a bride  I'm resolv'dand you know that my neighbours all say  Sir Nicholas Oddfish will have his own way  MRS FELIX  Selina dear Sir wants no other protection  While her life glides in peace by your gentle direction  Shethinks and I own I approve her remark  In conjugal cares 'tis too soon to embark  Her bosom untouch'd by Love's dangerous dart  Fate has not yet shewn her the man of her heart  SIR NICHOLAS  The man of her heartthese nonsensical fancies  You lightheaded females pick out of romances  That I am no tyrant you know very well  So Cousin don't teach my good Niece to rebel  I am no greedy guardian who thinks it his duty  On the altar of Plutus to sacrifice beauty  Whose venal barbarity justly abhorr'd  Ties a lovely young girl to an old crippled lord  And basely to gain either rank or estate  Makesher swear she will love what she cannot but hate  From such a protector Heaven guard my dear Niece  I wish her to wed that her joys may increase  And the deuce must be in the strange girl who discovers  No man to her mind in such plenty of lovers  To no very great length will my cruelty run  If from twenty admirers I bid her chuse one  MRS FELIX  But why dear Sir Nicholas why in such haste  SIR NICHOLAS  'Tis thus that my projects are ever disgrac'd  With the false names of hurry and precipitation  Because I abhor silly procrastination  That thief of delight who deludes all our senses  Who cheats us for ever with idle pretences  By whom like the dog in the fable betray'd  We let go the substance to snap at the shade  To seize present time is the true art of life  'Tis Time who now cries make Selina a wife  The season is come I've so long wish'd to see  From the moment I dandled her first on my knee  She you know to my care was bequeath'd by my Brother  And having this child I ne'er wish'd for another  Thro' life I have kept myself single for her  Her interest her joy to my own I prefer  SELINA  Your kindness dear Sir I can never repay  SIR NICHOLAS  In truth my dear damsel you easily may  I demand no return so enormously great  I ask but a boy to possess my estate  SELINA  Lord Uncle how come such odd thoughts in your head  MRS FELIX  From his heart I assure you'tis pleasantly said  A fair stipulationboth parties agreed  The compact I trust in due time will succeed  But patience dear Knight you will have your desire  Nor wait very long for a young little 'squite  SIR NICHOLAS  The cold stream of Patience ne'er creeps in my veins  But the wish my heart forms my quick spirit attains  I'm none of your chill atmospherical wretches  Whose affections are subject to starts and to catches  Whose wish like a weathercock veering about  Now turns towards hope and now changes to doubt  No mine like the needle without variation  Only looks to one point and that point's Consummation  I want to behold this young urchin arise  Before I have lost or my legs or my eyes  That I may enjoy all his little vagaries  As the changeable season of infancy varies  I long to be moulding his heart and his spirit  To shew him the fields he is born to inherit  Lead him round our rich woods while my limbs are yet limber  And tell the young rogue how I've nurs'd up his timber  That when the worn thread of my life is untwisted  He long may remember that I have existed  And when my old frame in our monument rests  As he walks by my grave with a few worthy guests  He thus to some warmhearted friend may address him  Here lies my odd honest old UncleGod bless him  MRS FELIX  Thank Heaven dear Cousin your hale constitution  Shews not the least sign of a near dissolution  SELINA  To make your life happy whate'er the condition  Has been my dear Uncle my highest ambition  To fulfil every wish that your fancy can frame  Still is as it ought to be ever my aim  But if by your voice I am doom'd to the altar  With terror and pain my weak accents must falter  Unless my kind stars a new lover should send me  Unlike all the swains who now deign to attend me  SIR NICHOLAS  Nice wench do you want the whole world to adore you  Would you have all the men of the earth rang'd before you  For thanks to your charms and to fortune's kind bounty  You may rank in your train all the youth of our county  And chuse whom you will if the man has but worth  And is nearly your equal in wealth and in birth  I give my consentyou are free from restriction  But I will not be plagu'd with perverse contradiction  I will see you wed without any delay  Your two fittest lovers are coming today  Young Sapphic whose verses delight all the fair  And Dicky Decisive Sir Jacob's next heir  Both young and both wealthy both comely and clever  To gain you no doubt each will warmly endeavour  For they come for a month by my own invitation  On purpose to sound my dear girl's inclination  I have said to them both and no man can speak fairer  Let him who can please her most win her and wear her  SELINA  aside to  Mrs Felix  Good angels defend me  MRS FELIX  I see nothing frightful  Our month with such guests must be very delightful  When Sapphic's soft verses incline us to dose  Dick will keep us awake with satirical prose  SIR NICHOLAS  Don't cross me I say nor mislead my good Niece  By Jove if she thwarts me with any caprice  Like a certain old Justice I'll ring up my maids  And marry the first of the frankhearted jades  For perverse contradiction I never will bear  But provide for myself a more dutiful heir  MRS FELIX  Dear Cousin in spite of his Worship's decision  You cannot be certain of such a provision  Attempts of that nature are subject to fail  SIR NICHOLAS  My designs you shall see Madam always prevail  For if this nice Gipsy by your machination  Declines every offer to give me vexation  Like my late jolly neighbour Sir Timothy Trickum  Who vindictively married the frail Molly Quickum  I'll make sure of the matter and chuse me a wife  With an heir ready plac'd on the threshold of life  For as I have said tho' a foe to restriction  I never will suffer perverse contradiction  You now know my mind which no mask ever covers  So farewell and prepare to receive your two lovers    Exit  MRS FELIX  Go thy way thou strange mixture of sense and of blindness  A model at once of oppression and kindness  Thy will thou odd compound of goodness and whim  Is a stream against which it is treason to swim  Yet we must cross the current  SELINA  Dear Cousin say how  Direct opposition he will not allow  What can you devise as a plan of prevention  How divert his keen spirit from this new intention  I had much rather die than be ever united  To one of the lovers that he has invited  My heart has a thorough aversion to both  Yet to make him unhappy I'm equally loth  When I think what I owe to his tender protection  The worst of all ills is to lose his affection  MRS FELIX  Dear Girl your warm gratitude gives you new charms  'Tis an amiable fear which your bosom alarms  And I from your Uncle's quick humour would screen you  Not loosen the bands of affection between you  He merits your love and you know he has mine  Yet we somehow must baffle his hasty design  Nor suffer his whim thus to make you a wife  To repent the rash business the rest of his life  Take courage kind chance may assist us  SELINA  I doubt it  Yet Heaven knows how we shall manage without it  For when his heart's set on a favourite scheme  His ardor and haste as you know are extreme  Like a med'cine illtim'd opposition is vain  And inflames the disorder 'twas meant to restrain  MRS FELIX  In his fevers indeed there is no intermission  And thanks gentle Coz to your soft disposition  So sweet and compliant your temper has been  You have taught him to think contradiction a sin  And here all around him confirm that belief  His vassals all bow to the nod of their chief  Here shut from the world in this rural dominion  No mortal opposes his will or opinion  And thus he is spoil'dPoliticians all say  Human nature's not fashion'd for absolute sway  SELINA  'Tis true tho' the world as you say think him odd  In this sphere he is held a diminutive god  And when I behold how his fortune is spent  In suppressing vexation and spreading content  When I hear all the poor his kind bounty expressing  And thoroughly know how he merits their blessing  My feelings with theirs in his eulogy join  And confess that his nature is truly divine  MRS FELIX  Thou excellent Girl if such fondness and zeal  For a warmhearted whimsical Uncle you feel  With what fine sensations your bosom will glow  What tender attachment your temper will shew  When your fortunate lord Love and Hymen invest  With higher dominion o'er that gentle breast  But tell me dear Cousinbe honestdeclare  Has no young secret swain form'd an interest there  I suspectbut don't let my suspicion affright you  Tho' the good Knight's rare virtues amuse and delight you  From this gloomy old hall you would wish to get free  Had not Cupid preserv'd you from feeling  ennui  Come tell me the name of the favourite youth  I am sure I guess right  SELINA  No in sad sober truth  I never have seen in the course of my life  A mortal to whom I should chuse to be wife  MRS FELIX  Ye stars what a pityI wish I could learn  That my Colonel from India would shortly return  Both for your sake and mine for our present distress  He would speedily turn into joyous success  As his regiment must some young hero afford  Who might throw at your feet both himself and his sword  What say you my dear to a soldier  Enter  Jenny  JENNY  Oh Madam  Here's young Mr SapphicI vow if I had them  I'd give fifty pounds had you seen how politely  He begg'd me to tie a sweet nosegay up tightly  Which is jolted to piecesWell he's a sweet beau  And now with his pencil he's writing below  I believe 'tis a posy he writes it so neatly  And I'm sure 'tis fine verse Ma'am it sounded so sweetly  MRS FELIX  Oh charming his vows will be very sublime  And I trust we shall hear his proposals in rhyme  SELINA  How can you dear Cousin so cruelly jest in  A business you know I am really distrest in  I shall certainly forfeit my Uncle's protection  For I never can wed where I feel no affection  Do help me  MRS FELIX  Good Girl this perplexity smother  And think your two lovers will banish each other  There's much to be hop'd from our present affairs  JENNY  O Ma'am Mr Sapphic is coming up stairs  Aside as she goes out  I am mightily pleas'd with this marrying plan  And I hope in my spirit that he'll be the man    Exit  Enter  Sapphic  SAPPHIC  Fair Ladies the moments have seem'd to be hours  While I stopt in your hall to adjust a few flowers  For the season I'm told they're uncommonly fine  But I still wish the tribute more worthy the shrine    Bowing and presenting them to  Selina  SELINA  Mr Sapphic is always extremely polite  These roses indeed are a wonderful sight  You are far better florists than we are  MRS FELIX  My dear  Mr Sapphic has magic to make them appear  And Flora is brib'd by the songs he composes  To produce for her poet extempore roses  Into this early bloom all her plants are bewitch'd  But you do not observe how the gift is inrich'd  Here's a border of verse if my eyes don't deceive me  SELINA  aside to  Mrs Felix  Dear Cousin you'll read itI pray you relieve me  I shall blush like a fool at each civil expression  MRS FELIX  aside to  Selina  taking the paper  Now with emphasis just and with proper discretion  Mrs Felix  reads  "Ye happy flowers give and receive perfume  "As on Selina's fragrant breast ye bloom  "From earth tho' not arrang'd in order nice  "Ye are transplanted into Paradise  "If on that spot ye languish into death  "'Twill be from envy of her sweeter breath"  'Tis a delicate compliment tender and pretty  What original spirit how graceful and witty  SAPPHIC  Dear Ma'am you're too good to find any thing in it  'Tis a mere hasty triflethe work of a minute  On the anvil I had not a moment to hammer  And I fear in my haste I have sinn'd against grammar  MRS FELIX  All slight imperfections I never regard  When I meet with such vigor of thought in a bard  With a fancy so brilliant  SAPPHIC  O Ma'am you're too kind  But candor's the test of an amiable mind  I wish that your taste all our Critics might guide  To soften that rigor with which they decide  MRS FELIX  From Critics dear Sir you have little to fear  If Mr Decisive himself had been here  He must have been charm'd with this sweet  jeu d'esprit  Which as he is coming today he shall see  I am eager to hear how his wit will applaud it  To conceal it would be of due praise to defraud it  SAPPHIC  In Mercy's name Ladies I beg your protection  Preserve my poor rhymes from Decisive's inspection  Consider how hasty  MRS FELIX  Say rather how springhtly  SAPPHIC  Compos'd in a moment  MRS FELIX  Produc'd so politely  SAPPHIC  He'll cut them to atoms  MRS FELIX  Dear Sir he's your friend  And I thought he had seen all the poems you penn'd  I was told that to him your long works you rehearse  Does Mr Decisive himself write in verse  SAPPHIC  I wish from my soul that he did now and then  But he uses the penknife much more than the pen  And too freely has flash'd all who write in the nation  To give them an opening for retaliation  My old friend Decisive has honour and wit  To the latter indeed he makes most things submit  And thinks it fair sport as a friend or a foe  To knock down a Bard by a flaming  bon mot  To your sex indeed his chief failings I trace  For the fairones so flatter'd his figure and face  That too early he ceas'd the chaste Muses to follow  And being Adonis would not be Apollo  MRS FELIX  Yet he has much fancy  SAPPHIC  O Madam no doubt  And genius that study would soon have brought out  Had his thoughts been less turn'd to his legs and his looks  Ere this he'd have written some excellent books  'Tis pity such parts should thro' indolence fall  But he never composes and reads not at all  SELINA  Not read Mr Sapphic you surely mistake  Your friend cannot be an illiterate rake  Our neighbours who lately from London came down  Declare that his word forms the taste of the town  SAPPHIC  Dear Madam the business is easily done  He judges all authors but never reads one  MRS FELIX  I'm sure he must own this  impromptu  is sweet  And I vow he shall read it  SAPPHIC  Dear Ma'am I intreat  I conjure you to spare me this earnest petition  I know you will grant me  MRS FELIX  On this one condition  That for six lines suppress'd you indulge me with twenty  Come shew us your pocketbookthere you have plenty  Of tender poetical squibs for the Fair  SAPPHIC  taking out his pocketbook  Dear Ma'am here is nothing  MRS FELIX  A volume I swear  O charmingwell now you're an excellent man  'Tis stuff'd like a pincushion  SAPPHIC  Yes Ma'amwith bran  MRS FELIX  Fie fie you're too modest and murder my meaning  What a harvest is here yet I ask but a gleaning  It would not be fair to seize all the collection  Tho' all is most certainly worthy inspection  Indulge us dear Sir come I'll take no refusal  SAPPHIC  Indeed Ma'am here's nothing that's fit for perusal  MRS FELIX  There are fifty fine things and one can't chuse amiss  SAPPHIC  taking out a paper  Here's one new little song  MRS FELIX  Well then let me have this  SAPPHIC  after giving a paper  They all are so jumbled I fear I am wrong  I meant to have shewn you a new little song  Which was written last week on the ball at our races  Where I heard the Miss Trotters compar'd to the Graces  I could not help saying 'twas very profane  It was taking the name of the Graces in vain  MRS FELIX  reads  "  On seeing Selina and Jenny near each other in the garden  "  SAPPHIC  O mercy dear Madam you must not read those  A stanza unfinish'd  MRS FELIX  How sweetly it flows  Selina pray hear it  SELINA  aside to  MRS FELIX  Dear Cousin enough  How can you delight in his horrible stuff  MRS FELIX  reads  "Tho' each in the same garden blows  "The poet must be crazy  "Who when invited by the rose  "Can stoop to pick the daisy"  SELINA  aside to  MRS FELIX  If you love me dear Cousin assist me I pray  To end all this nonsense and get him away  Pray Sir when you came was my Uncle below  SAPPHIC  He's abroad Ma'am your servant inform'd me  SELINA  O No  You have heard he is building a temple to Pan  And we hope that your taste may embellish the plan  At the end of the walk in his favourite grove  Where there formerly stood an old ruin'd alcove  You'll find him and as 'tis an art you are skill'd in  'Twill please him to know what you think of the building  MRS FELIX  Aye do Mr Sapphic inspect what is done  For the workmen all blunder'd when first they begun  Your opinion I'm sure will oblige the good Knight  SELINA  An inscription he once said he wish'd you to write  SAPPHIC  Dear Madamthe hint is delightful I vow  To the God of Arcadia I hasten to bow  I shall find the good Knight in the midst of the dome  I am heartily glad that he is not from home  We shall surely contrive something clever between us  And the Muse will compose by the order of Venus    Bows tenderly to  Selina  and Exit  SELINA  How could you so praise that impertinent creature  And praise him without discomposing a feature  I could not have thought before this conversation  That your frankness could turn into such adulation  MRS FELIX  The world my dear Child is to you quite unknown  When you see it you'll find such discourse is the  ton  Fine folks in high life learn to praise with great glee  Such persons and things as they sicken to see  To me your best thanks for my speeches are due  By thus flattering the Poet I surely serve you  He will now play the Skylark instead of the Dove  And stun me with songs while you're sav'd from his love  Enter  Jenny  JENNY  Dear Ma'am now I hope Mr Sapphic's quite blest  For he flies thro' the walks like a bird to his nest  He's a sweet pretty gentleman  MRS FELIX  aside to  Selina  This if I shew it  Will soon banish Jenny's regard for the poet  Jenny see what your friend Mr Sapphic has written  JENNY  Dear Ma'am with his verses I always am smitten    Having read the stanza    A Daisy indeed to be sure I am neat  But tho' I'm a servant I hope I am sweet  When he makes my young Mistress a Rose or a Lily  He might turn me at least to a Daffydowndilly  But a Daisy forsooth with no fragrance at all  I'll cross him for this  SELINA  What's that noise in the hall  JENNY  As sure as I live 'tis your other gay Spark  For I saw a new chaise driving into the park  I'll see Ma'am  Aside going out  I'll shew this fine Poet a trick  A Daisy that no one but children will pick    Exit  MRS FELIX  This simile Jenny I see cannot swallow  And her anger may ruin this son of Apollo  For in courtship this maxim is often display'd  He has half lost the Mistress who loses the Maid  Enter  Decisive  DECISIVE  Alone my dear Ladiesthey told me below  Our friend Sapphic was here your poetical Beau  I was almost afraid that my sudden intrusion  Might check the rich stream of some lyric effusion  To  Selina  I am happy to see you so lovely today  But I hope I've not frighted your Poet away  SELINA  O noMr Sapphic had bid us adieu  MRS FELIX  And not without saying some fine things of you  He declares that with those brilliant parts you possess  'Tis a sin you ne'er send any work to the press  DECISIVE  Good SapphicIn truth 'tis his comfort to think  The whole duty of man lies in spilling of ink  And at Paradise gate his large volumes of metre  Will I hope be allow'd a fair pass by Saint Peter  MRS FELIX  Then the Saint must be free from your critical spirit  For I know you have little esteem for their merit  You're a rigorous judge and to poets terrific  DECISIVE  I wish my friend's Muse was not quite so prolific  But in rhymes when a child I have heard he would squeak  And so proved a poet before he could speak  On his deathbed I doubt not he'll still think of verse  And groan out a rhyme to his doctor or nurse  MRS FELIX  I fancy your favourite reading is prose  Here's a new set of travels pray have you read those  DECISIVE  taking the book  This author is lucky to meet with a buyer  A traveller's but a soft word for a liar  Such works may please those who have ne'er been abroad  But men who have travell'd perceive all the fraud  MRS FELIX  Is the work so deceitful it seems you have read it  DECISIVE  Not a syllable Madam  MRS FELIX  Pray who then has said it  DECISIVE  Not a soul that I knowbut such books are a trade  And I perfectly know how those volumes are made  MRS FELIX  'Tis a work I am told that has great reputation  Both for wit and for truth  DECISIVE  We're a credulous nation  MRS FELIX  Pray what kind of books are your favourite study  DECISIVE  I find modern works only make the brain muddy  As my friends grew by reading more awkward than wise  And ruin'd their persons and clouded their eyes  I have wisely resolv'd not to read any more  Since each living author is turn'd to a  bore  MRS FELIX  How can you so waste all your bright mental powers  'Tis pity you men have not such works as ours  What d'ye say to my knotting  Takes out her work  DECISIVE  Your box wants a hinge  And I'll give you a much better pattern for fringe  I brought it from France  MRS FELIX  Now I see my good friend  There is no kind of work which your skill cannot mend  In all arts you possess a distinguishing head  From building a temple to knotting a thread  DECISIVE  Apropos  of a templepray has the good Knight  Rais'd his altar to Panhe had fix'd on the site  Is the structure begunI have not seen his plan  MRS FELIX  Then hasten and pay your devotions to Pan  Sir Nicholas now in his vestibule stands  To guide all his workmen and quicken their hands  And Sapphic is gone to attend the good Knight  And try what inscription his genius can write  DECISIVE  Poor Pan by the Graces thou'rt left in the lurch  Thy temple will look like a trim parish church  With Sapphic's inscriptions like scraps of the Bible  Put up as the Churchwardens say in a  libel  MRS FELIX  Indeed we much fear sopray haste to inspect it  And exert all your exquisite taste to correct it  DECISIVE  Ma'am I'll do what I can for it puts me in wrath  To see a fine temple disgrac'd by a Goth    Exit  MRS FELIX  Well my dear your two Lovers like true men of fashion  Do not pester you much with the heat of their passion  You'll be quite at your easethanks to Pan and the Muse  Enter  Jenny  hastily  JENNY  News news my dear Ladies most excellent news  SELINA  The girl is quite wild  MRS FELIX  What transports you so Jenny  JENNY  I've news for you Madam that's well worth a guinea  I have news from the Colonel  MRS FELIX  A letter Where is it  JENNY  No Ma'am here's a stranger arriv'd on a visit  And he comes from the place where the Colonel is fighting  MRS FELIX  And with letters for me  JENNY  Madam that I'm not right in  For I run from his man when I got half my story  But the Colonel he says is all riches and glory  MRS FELIX  Dear girl that's enough through my life I shall feel  Due regard for thy warm and affectionate zeal  But where is this Stranger  JENNY  Just walk'd to my Master  His poor man has met with a cruel disaster  He was wounded in battle  SELINA  Pray treat him with care  In your joy my dear Cousin I heartily share  MRS FELIX  This Stranger's a jewel for you from the East  He's a Captain I hope my dear Jenny at least  JENNY  Ah Madam my fancy suppos'd him so too  But we're both in the wrong and for Miss he won't do  For I learnt from his man he is only a Doctor  MRS FELIX  Poor Jane how the difference of title has shock'd her  For my part I can't find by my reason or feeling  That the art of destroying excels that of healing  We may equally love the professors of both  JENNY  That Miss tho' should marry a Doctor I'm loth  MRS FELIX  Come my dear let us meet 'emI can't rest above  How slowly fly letters from hands that we love  End of ACT I  ACT II  SCENE I  Enter  Jenny  and  Jonathan  JENNY  COME dear Mr Jonathan tell me the whole  An account of a battle I love to my soul  There is nothing on earth I so truly delight in  As to hear a brave Soldier discourse about fighting  So the Colonel was wounded you say near the wall  Whereabouts was the shot Did he instantly fall  JONATHAN  No recoiling a little he rush'd on again  And fought like a lion made fiercer by pain  Tho' a cursed keen arrow an Indian let fly  Pierc'd the bone of his cheek just below the right eye  'Twas a horrible wound but it could not appall him  JENNY  O mercy that such a hard fate should befall him  Alas I'm afraid that his fine manly face  Must have lost by the scar all its spirit and grace  Does he look very hideous  JONATHAN  No thanks to my Master  You can hardly perceive that he e'er wore a plaister  There never was known a more wonderful cure  But kind Heaven assists my good Master I'm sure  Without it the skill of no mortal could save  The many brave lads he has kept from the grave  You would weep with delight to behold him surrounded  With a hundred fine fellows once horribly wounded  Who with thanks for their lives are still eager to greet him  And hail him with blessings whenever they meet him  JENNY  God reward him say I for the good he has done  And of those he has sav'd I'm glad you are one  JONATHAN  Aye twice he preserv'd me when all thought me dead  And once brought me off at the risque of his head  It was not his business to mix in the strife  And some thought him mad when he ventur'd his life  To bring off a poor mangled private like me  But I've still a heart left in this trunk that you see  Which loves the brave spirit who snatch'd me from death  And will serve him I hope till my very last breath  JENNY  Your scenes of hard service I hope are all over  It is now fairly time you should both live in clover  Your Master I trust has brought home as much treasure  As will make him a parliamentman at his pleasure  And to recompense you for the wound in your arm  Perhaps he will buy you a snug little farm  JONATHAN  When a Gentleman comes from the East my good girl  You all think he is loaded with diamonds and pearl  You fancy his treasure too great to be told  And suppose he possesses a mountain of gold  A few daring blades by a bold kind of stealth  Have indeed from the Indies brought home so much wealth  That with all their keen senses they ne'er could employ it  And have dy'd from the want of a heart to enjoy it  But some hundred brave lads whom gay youth led to enter  That promising region of hope and adventure  Have toil'd many years in those rich burning climes  With small share of their wealth and with none of their crimes  Now my Master and I both belong to this tribe  Not a single Nabob have we kill'd for a bribe  And to tell you a truth which I hope you'll not doubt  We're as poor and as honest as when we set out  JENNY  What your Master still poor in so thriving a trade  And with patients so rich has he never been paid  For the wounds he has heal'd  JONATHAN  Yes my dear for his fees  I know he has touch'd many thousand rupees  But the sight of distress he could never endure  What he took from the rich he bestow'd on the poor  JENNY  Well Heaven will pay him no doubt in due season  But what brings him homeI would fain know the reason  Why he leaves that rich land in the bloom of his life  I suppose from the want of a cherrycheek'd wife  They say those black wenches are sad nasty creatures  And tho' they've fine shapes they have horrible features  Does he want a white sweetheart or has he a Black  JONATHAN  'Tis indeed a white woman that brings us both back  But alas 'tis an old onemy Master it seems  Has a fond simple mother that's troubled with dreams  And he like a tender and softhearted youth  Resigns his fine prospect and comes home forsooth  Because the old dame has express'd her desires  To see him in England before she expires  And egad since he's come she will live long enough  For she seems to be made of good durable stuff  JENNY  Well now I shall love him a hundred times more  Than I did for the stories you told me before  God bless the kind soul who behaves to his mother  As if he well knew he could ne'er have another  And were he my son I could not live without him  I could stay here all day while you're talking about him  But 'tis time to be gone we must both disappear  For the Colonel's sweet Wife and your Master are here  JONATHAN  Stop I must peep at hershe's as bright as the day  JENNY  And her heart is as good as her spirit is gay  Come I'll shew you our walkswe may get out this way    Exeunt  Enter  Mrs Felix  and  Morley  MRS FELIX  Dear excellent Friend since I owe to your worth  The safety of what I most value on earth  With those it loves best my heart yields you a place  And I clasp your kind hand with a sister's embrace  To judge of the man whom such service endears  I want not the tardy acquaintance of years  But in strong tho' quick ties that no chances can sever  In an instant he seizes my friendship for ever  And had I much less obligation to you  My regard and esteem I should still think your due  From the picture my Felix has drawn of your mind  MORLEY  His warm soul to his friends is most partially kind  But such as I am I most truly am yours  Your goodness my grateful attachment ensures  And my heart with proud transport your friendship embraces  Tho' I ne'er gaz'd before on your personal graces  I've beguil'd some long weeks of hard wearisome duty  With frequent discourse on your virtues and beauty  And I own for the Colonel it rais'd my esteem  To mark with what pleasure he dwelt on the theme  MRS FELIX  You're an excellent creature to sooth a fond Wife  Who regards her Lord's love hardly less than his life  But since you've replied with goodhumour so steady  To the ten thousand questions I've ask'd you already  I'll spare you today and if 'tis in my power  Mention Felix's name only once in an hour  That my thoughts to the Indies no longer may roam  Let me talk to you now about matters at home  Your counsel may make our perplexity less  And finish our odd tragicomic distress  First tell me and speak without any disguise  Tho' I fancy I read all your thoughts in your eyes  What d'ye think of my Cousin  MORLEY  Her graces indeed  The glowing description of Felix exceed  Tho' in praising her oft he with pleasure has smil'd  Like a father describing his favourite child  For my part I think she is lavishly blest  With those beauties by which the pure mind is exprest  That her heart is with truth and with tenderness warm  That sweet sensibility shines in her form  A form on which no man his eye ever turn'd  Without feeling his breast in her welfare concern'd  'Tis the lot of such graces wherever they dwell  None can see their soft mistress and not wish her well  MRS FELIX  Very gallantly said and the praise is her due  But how came her Lovers so well known to you  MORLEY  Her Loversdear Madam I hope you're in jest  Or if by their vows your sweet Friend is addrest  Heaven grant for the peace of her delicate mind  That her hand may be never to either resign'd  MRS FELIX  From my soul I assure you I join in your prayer  But whence does it spring  MORLEY  I will freely declare  Tho' they're both men of fortune fair birth and good name  With figures that set some young nymphs in a flame  Tho' at each many ladies are ready to catch  At what the world calls a most excellent match  Yet if I have read your fair Cousin aright  A bosom so tender a spirit so bright  Must be wretched with such a companion for life  As each of these Lovers would prove to his Wife  MRS FELIX  You are right but their characters where could you know  MORLEY  I knew them at college a few years ago  Before by a whimsical odd sort of fate  And some family losses too long to relate  In Europe my views of prosperity ceas'd  And chance sent me forth to my friends in the East  MRS FELIX  Pray what sort of youths were these two modish men  MORLEY  You now find them both what they seem'd to me then  Two characters form'd like most young men of fashion  Whose cold selfish pride is their sovereign passion  In each tho' they're men of an opposite turn  The same heartfreezing vanity still you discern  To indulge that dear vanity each still displays  All the force of his mind tho' in different ways  Thence in spinning weak verse Sapphic's toil never ends  And Decisive ne'er stops in deriding his friends  Each equally fancies no nymph can resist  His lips which he thinks all the Graces have kift  MRS FELIX  Perfect knowledge of both your just picture has shown  The warmth of these Lovers diverts me I own  Of conquest each seems to himself very clear  And feels from his rivals no diffident fear  'Tis easy to see from their satisfied air  Each loves his own person much more than the Fair  But my poor gentle Coz wishes both at a distance  And I want to contrive by your friendly assistance  To relieve her and quietly send them from hence  Without the Knight's knowledge  MORLEY  As neither wants sense  Can't the Lady pronounce their dismission at once  Which none can mistake but an impudent dunce  MRS FELIX  This measure seems easy indeed at first view  But alas 'tis a measure we dare not pursue  Our warmhearted whimsical positive Knight  Allows not to woman this natural right  And hence my young Friend in a pitiful case  Knows not how to reject what she ne'er can embrace  For nothing her Uncle's resentment would smother  Should she banish one suitor and not take the other  MORLEY  Then indeed I am griev'd for the Lady's distress  But how can I aid her  MRS FELIX  'Tis hard I confess  To a sudden retreat this bold Pair to oblige  And make two such Heroes abandon a siege  Yet I wish we could do itand when they recede  The departure of both must appear their own deed  MORLEY  after a pause  Wellmy friendship for you has suggested a scheme  MRS FELIX  'Tis a service our hearts will for ever esteem  But what is your project  MORLEY  Don't question me what  Lest you think me a fool for too simple a plot  'Tis simple and yet I would venture my life  It will drive from these Beaus all their thoughts of a Wife  And if my scheme prospers with joy I'll confess  What a whimsical trifle produc'd our success  MRS FELIX  Well keep your own secret if silence is best  Tho' a woman for once I'll in ignorance rest  Here comes our friend Sapphiche seems in a flurry  MORLEY  His step shews indeed a poetical hurry  And we shall be call'd in as Gossips fair neighbour  For by the Bard's bustle his Muse is in labour  Enter  Sapphic  SAPPHIC  Dear Ma'am may I ask you for paper and ink  Lest a fresh  jeu d'esprit  in oblivion should sink  For when my free fancy has brought forth my verse  My treacherous memory proves a bad nurse  MRS FELIX  O pray for your Muse let us rear her young chit  For the bantling no doubt must have spirit and wit  As a cradle to hold it I beg you'll take that  giving him a paper  And your Friend here will aid you in dressing the Brat  At a rite so important I merit no place  And I beg to withdraw while you're washing its face    Exit  SAPPHIC  That's charming gay creatureluxuriant and young  But I've lost half a stanzathe deuce take her tongue  Let me seelet me see if I can't recollect it  'Tis doneand now Morley pray hear or inspect it  MORLEY  The Poet himself his own verse should recite  SAPPHIC  You're a sensible fellowyour maxim is right  Reads  "Thy old Arcadia Pan resign  "For this more rich retreat  "A fairer nymph here decks thy shrine  "Be this thy fav'rite seat"  Well my Friend won't this bring the old God out of Greece  MORLEY  Aye and make good Sir Nicholas give you his Niece  SAPPHIC  Yes I fancy this stanza will make the Girl mine  MORLEY  What Poet can wish for a prize more divine  I give you much joy on your conquest my Friend  Yet the eyes of regret on your nuptials I bend  And grieve in reflecting that conjugal joy  Your poetical harvest of Fame must destroy  SAPPHIC  What the deuce do you mean  MORLEY  To those great works adieu  Which the world now expects with impatience from you  The Poet when blest can no more be sublime  And a chill matrimonial must strike thro' his rhyme  SAPPHIC  You're mistaken dear Doctorconnubial delight  Will give a new zest to each poem I write  And you'll see such productions  MORLEY  'Tis true now and then  Polemics by marriage have quicken'd their pen  A Dutch Critic I know by the aid of his Wife  Made a book and a child every year of his life  But total seclusion from Venus and Bacchus  Is you know to the Bard recommended by Flaccus  A grand epic poem I hear you are writing  'Tis a work that your country will take great delight in  But consider my Friend when you're deep in heroics  As Poets have not all the patience of Stoics  How you'll grieve to be check'd in the flow of your verse  By a young squalling child and an old fcolding nurse  E'en the qualms of your Lady may drive from your brain  Fine thoughts that you ne'er can recover again  Reflect how you'll feel with such hopes of succeeding  If your Muse should miscarry because your Wife's breeding  SAPPHIC  Egad in that case I should think my fate hard  MORLEY  I myself have beheld an unfortunate Bard  Who his nails for a rhyme unsuccessfully bit  When family cares had extinguish'd his wit  With many who sing in the Muse's full choir  It would do them no mischief to muffle their lyre  But for you whom the Nine with a tender presage  Are prepar'd to proclaim the first Bard of our age  For you who of Taste are the favourite theme  SAPPHIC  Yes I think I stand high in the publie esteem  MORLEY  For you I should grieve if domestic delight  On your fair rising laurels should fall as a blight  'Tis the pride of great minds whom the Muses inflame  To sacrifice joy on the altar of Fame  Your passion's renownof this Girl are you fonder  On this delicate point I must leave you to ponder  Consider it while I attend the old Knight    Exit  SAPPHIC  alone after a pause  By Jove I believe my friend Morley is right  Thou Fame art my Mistress to win thee I sing  This Girl tho' she's handsome is but a dull thing  'Tis clear whensoe'er I a poem rehearse  That she has no relish for elegant verse  Her fortune indeed would be rather convenient  But the glorious to me is before the expedient  Egad I'd quit Venus herself if I knew  That the system of Morley was certainly true  I don't think the Girl to Decisive inclin'd  But here comes her Maid who may tell me her mind  Enter  Jenny  My good little Jenny you're trusty and true  And your Mistress I know tells her secrets to you  What you know to a friend you may safely impart  And give me a perfect account of her heart  Pray how do I stand in your Lady's regard  JENNY  Now's my time to be even with this saucy Bard    aside    To be sure Sir the taste of my Lady is odd  But poetry moves her no more than a clod  SAPPHIC  What no relish for rhymeDoes she never repeat  The soft little sonnets I've laid at her feet  JENNY  Ah Sir would my Mistress were once of my mind  For I read all the verses of yours that I find  But my Lady's so cruel she thwarts my desire  And to hide them from me throws them into the fire  SAPPHIC  She's a foolshe's a fool  aside  I should have a fine life  With such a prosaic dull jade of a wife  JENNY  But my good Sir I hope you will not be dejected  I could tell you by whom all your wit is respected  There's a heart upon which you have made such impression  But I must not betray her by my indiscretion  SAPPHIC  Whom d'ye mean my good Jenny come tell me my dear  JENNY  You would make a bad use of the secret I fear  Now I hope I shall lead the Bard into a scrape  aside  For he bites like a Gudgeon and cannot escape  SAPPHIC  Come say who's in love with meif she is fair  I'll not leave the dear creature I vow to despair  JENNY  O lud I protest she is coming this way  But I did not intend her regard to betray  I must flybut I beg that you'll not be too free    Exit  SAPPHIC  Madam FelixI thought she was partial to me  Enter  Mrs Felix  MRS FELIX  May I enter without incommoding the Muse  SAPPHIC  By a question like this your own charms you abuse  Those eyes my dear Madam were form'd I profess  To inspirit a Poet and not to depress  From your presence he surely must catch inspiration  MRS FELIX  A very poetical fine salutation  But I seriously beg if you're busy with rhyme  That you will not allow me to take up your time  As I'm not Selina you're free from restriction  And may tell me plain truths unembellish'd with fiction  SAPPHIC  Then I swear my dear creature I swear by this hand  That I feel as I touch it my genius expand  That your lipsO by Jove he's a madman or booby  Who roves to the Indies for diamond or ruby  And each vein in my heart his strange folly condemns  Who leaves these more bright and more exquisite gems  Sweet Fair let me keep while their richness I praise  The cold damp of neglect from o'erclouding their rays  While  Mr Sapphic  kisses  Mrs Felix  with great vehemence  Jenny  enters unperceived  JENNY  O hohave I caught you impertinent Poet  This is more than I hop'd formy Master shall know it    Exit  MRS FELIX  Good God Mr Sapphic what frantic illusion  Has produc'd this ridiculous scene of confusion  All Poets are Quixotes in love I am told  And the truth of the adage in you I behold  As the Knight once mistook an old mill for a giant  Your sense as disorder'd your fancy as pliant  Takes me for my Cousinyour love's ebullition  I only can pardon on this supposition  I fain would suppose that no insult was meant  Nor believe you could think what I ought to resent  SAPPHIC  O talk not of anger with lips that inspire  The strongest sensation of rapturous fire  That with love's sweet convulsions shake every nerve  O think not that I your resentment deserve  Because my warm heart thus engross'd by your charms  Is ambitious of filling these dear empty arms  No let me while basking beneath your bright eye  The place of a thankless deserter supply  And in this melting breast kindle ecstacy's flame  Which Nature design'd for so glowing a frame  MRS FELIX  Away Sirand since in your fondling insanity  You reject the excuse which I form'd for your vanity  My threats must inform you  SAPPHIC  O frown not sweet creature  Let not wrath spoil the charm of thy every feature  MRS FELIX  Regain you your sensefrom my wrath you are free  Which should not be rais'd by a being like thee  Begone thenmy pardon in vain you'll implore  If you dare on this subject to breathe a word more  SAPPHIC  Words indeed my warm fair one by Nature's confession  For the love that I feel are no proper expression  The soul's fond intent in soft murmurs should swell  And kisses explain what no language can tell  Ye Gods how luxuriant  MRS FELIX  Away quit my arm  Or my cries in an instant the house shall alarm  SAPPHIC  Provoking sweet creatureindulge my fond passion  Come come don't I know you're a woman of fashion  Your coyness I've heard you can sometimes give over  And I'm sure you're too wise to be true to a rover  Besides I have learnt that with partial regard  You have cast a kind eye on your illtreated Bard  MRS FELIX  Away thou vain coxcomb nor base as thou art  Insult the bright Lord of so loyal a heart  BegoneI abhor theemy person release  SIR NICHOLAS  entering  Is it thus my young Sir you pay court to my Niece  SAPPHIC  Confusion What devil has sent the old Knight  SIR NICHOLAS  How dare you pert stripling almost in my sight  To insult a chaste female that's under my roof  But since of your baseness you give me such proof  You shall feel it repaid by a proper correction  SAPPHIC  aside  Deuce take this perverse and unlucky detection  I wish I had wisely as Morley had taught me  Renounc'd that jade Venus before he thus caught me  What excuse can I make him  To  Sir Nicholas  My dear worthy Sir  Tho' I now seem most justly your wrath to incur  Yet as you grow cool your opinion will vary  You will not resent such an idle vagary  A mere romping frolic  SIR NICHOLAS  A frolic d'ye say  Then a frolic of mine shall your frolic repay  Call our servants to punish this frolicsome spark  They shall drag him across the new pond in the park  SAPPHIC  aside  'Tis what he can't meanyet his countenance such is  I wish from my soul I was out of his clutches  To  Sir Nicholas  Dear Sir I assure you I'm griev'd beyond measure  That I thus have awaken'd your furious displeasure  When calmer  SIR NICHOLAS  Young man I am not in a fury  A sentence more just never came from a jury  Such frolics as yours have Old England disgrac'd  In high life let them flourish as fashion and taste  To those wanton young fellows I am not severe  Who attack the loose Wife of a vain gambling Peer  My Lady whose Lord wastes at Hazard the night  May plead to more generous pleasures some right  I care not how each keeps their conjugal oath  Since honour and peace must be strangers to both  But when a brave Soldier pure Glory's true son  Ennobled with laurels laboriously won  When risking in far distant climates his life  To his Country he leaves a fair innocent Wife  Accurst be the man who to friendship unjust  Fails to guard as his soul this most delicate trust  Or to punish those fops who insult her chaste beauty  And invite her to swerve from her honour and duty  Of the doom that I think to such libertines due  I will give to the world an example in you  Our old English discipline Ducking by name  Shall atone for your outrage by quenching your flame  Here William and John  MRS FELIX  For my sake I intreat  That you will not dear Sir this rough vengeance compleat  SIR NICHOLAS  By Jupiter Cousin to make him less fond  He shall croak out his love to the frogs of our pond  Here William tell Jack after Stephen to skip  And tell the old Huntsman to come with his whip  Then wait all together around the hall door  SAPPHIC  O mercy dear Sir I your mercy implore  You will not destroy me  SIR NICHOLAS  No only correct  And teach you a brave Soldier's Wife to respect  MRS FELIX  Yet think my dear Cousin yet think for my sake  What a noise this ridiculous matter will make  You know that my Felix's nature is such  He don't wish his Wife to be talk'd of too much  His honour and quiet let us make our care  And bury in silence this foolish affair  Perhaps in my manners too easy and gay  My levity led the young Poet astray  SIR NICHOLAS  No no I my good creature you must not arraign  Your innocent self in a business so plain  Besides his offence by this plea cannot sink  For they are the worst of all puppies that think  Each woman's a wanton who is not precise  And that cheerfulness must be the herald of vice  MRS FELIX  Howe'er this may beas he's now all repentance  I earnestly beg a repeal of your sentence  SAPPHIC  Dear Ma'am I adore you for this intercession  And I trust the good Knight will forgive my transgression  SIR NICHOLAS  Well Sir as beyond your desert you're befriended  By that virtue which you have so grossly offended  You are free to depart but remember young swain  That you ne'er touch the Wife of a Soldier again  SAPPHIC  If I do may I die by the wind of a ball  Heaven bless you good folks and this sociable hall  Since my amorous folly your friendship thus loses  My amours shall henceforth be confin'd to the Muses    Exit  MRS FELIX  I thank you dear Sir and rejoice in my heart  That in safety you've suffer'd this youth to depart  SIR NICHOLAS  By Jupiter Coz I had cool'd your warm Poet  Had I not been afraid all our neighbours might know it  And make you the subject of such conversation  As I think your nice Colonel would hear with vexation  Then since for your sake I have let the Bard go  Come and aid me to settle all matters below  That my anxious cares in her comfort may cease  I'm resolv'd young Decisive shall marry my Niece  End of ACT II  ACT III  SCENE I  Enter  Mrs Felix  and  Selina  MRS FELIX  WELL my dear what d'ye think of our medical friend  Whom the letters of Felix so highly commend  If my gratitude does not my judgment mislead  He's the man in the world who with you might succeed  Tho' gentle yet manly tho' bashful polite  Are you not half in love  SELINA  Yes indeed at first sight  His service to you on my heart is engrav'd  And I love him I own for the life he has sav'd  To win me perhaps he might not find it hard  So esteem'd as he is by the friends I regard  But I fancy such thoughts will not enter his brain  And for my part instead of attracting a swain  I only shall think as they heartily vex me  Of escaping from those who already perplex me  MRS FELIX  O make yourself easy I pray on that head  In the deepest disgrace the poor Poet is fled  And I trust that the Critic will soon share his fate  Come with meI've a most curious tale to relate  Let us hasteI perceive that Decisive is near  In whose present discourse I would not interfere    Exeunt  Enter  Decisive  and  Morley  DECISIVE  So while in the grove I was cooly projecting  New plans for the temple the Knight is erecting  Our Poet addicted to amorous sin  Grew a little too fond of the Ladies within  But discovery happen'd his passion to damp  And this is the cause of his haste to decamp  MORLEY  The old Knight I believe such resentment express'd  As quicken'd the speed of his fugitive guest  On Terror's swift wing he is certainly flown  And as he has retreated the field is your own  DECISIVE  As a rival I had not much fear of poor Sapphic  Bad rhyme's current coin in most amorous traffic  But would not pass here  MORLEY  I think not in your view  As it finds such a critical touchstone in you  The Poet's dismission your triumph ensures  And the prize my good friend is now certainly yours  A prize that we justly may call very great  A lovely sweet girl with a noble estate  DECISIVE  The girl's very well but knows nothing of life  It will cost me some pains to new model my Wife  But I think she will gladly receive my correction  And my wealthy old kinsman approves the connection  Coughs  MORLEY  You've a cough my good friend  DECISIVE  Yes a trifling one  Hem  Have you got any Indian prescription for phlegm  MORLEY  Believe me that cough is no trifling affair  It calls I assure you for caution and care  With regret I point out so unpleasant a truth  But your constitution I've known from your youth  Your hectic appearance I see with concern  As I know with your frame if health takes such a turn  The least indiscretion your life may destroy  The slightest excess in diversion and joy  Even those tender cares which on life's purest plan  Must belong to the state of a Family Man  May lead to disease from which art cannot save  And rapidly hurry you into the grave  'Twere better this courtship of yours should miscarry  For you'll certainly die in six months if you marry  DECISIVE  Are you serious dear Doctor  MORLEY  By such a sad end  I lately have lost a poor goodhumour'd friend  You remember Jack Dangle at College no doubt  He was just of your age and a little more stout  He with other young sages left Westminster Hall  To teach English law to the slaves of Bengal  But Jack in his new chamberpractice at least  Too eagerly follow'd the rules of the East  A bad cough ensu'd much like yours in its sound  Decisive  coughs  Good God I could swear 'twas poor Jack under ground  'Tis his tone so exactly sepulchral and hollow  The system he slighted I hope you will follow  With pains in his breast he was sharply tormented  But as he at first to my guidance consented  Some time my strict regimen kept him alive  Poor Dangle once more was beginning to thrive  And had he some months in my plan persever'd  On the earth at this moment he might have appear'd  But chance threw a pretty white girl in his way  And eager for marriage fond Jack would not stay  In vain I conjur'd him to wait half a year  And shew'd him the danger he ran very clear  He thought the remains of his cough but a trifle  And being unable his passion to stifle  He took his fair wifebut alas the vile cough  Encreas'd every day till it carried him off  DECISIVE  I don't recollect any pain in my breast  But I feel a strange tightness just now in my chest  MORLEY  How's your stomach  DECISIVE  I've nothing to fear on that score  MORLEY  Do you eat as you did  DECISIVE  Yes I think rather more  MORLEY  That ravenous hunger's the thing that I dread  How d'ye sleep  DECISIVE  All the time that I pass in my bed  MORLEY  IndeedI don't like so lethargic a slumber  DECISIVE  Why my friend of good symptoms these rank in the number  MORLEY  Alas you may call them all good if you please  By that title you only confirm your disease  In which tho' the patient declines very fast  He for ever will flatter himself to the last  Believe me your symptoms are rather alarming  Yet your present disorder there is not much harm in  If you can but abstain with a spirit resign'd  From all that may harrass your body or mind  To a different climate I wish you'd repair  And for one winter breathe a less changeable air  Spend a Christmas at Naples and when you return  You may marry without any anxious concern  But you're now at that critical period of life  When in such frames as yours nature feels an odd strife  And if quiet does not all her functions befriend  The short earthly scene on a sudden will end  On a point so important you'll pardon my freedom  DECISIVE  Your cautions oblige me I feel that I need 'em  For in truth I am growing as thin as a rabbit  And there's something consumptive I know in my habit  My father died soon after taking a wife  And cough'd out his soul when I jump'd into life  I suppose I am going  MORLEY  Take courage my friend  On your own prudent conduct your life will depend  If you take but due care for two years I'll engage  You will stand a fair chance for a healthy old age  Nor would I advise you this girl to refuse  A distant attachment your mind will amuse  And no doubt for a man of your fortune and figure  She will wait till your health has recover'd its vigour  DECISIVE  I can part with the girl without feeling a chasm  In my heart that will shake with no amorous spasm  For to tell you the truth my old rich Uncle Cob  Is more eager than I for this marrying job  By this scheme the old blade is supremely delighted  Because two large manors may thus be united  But when of his park I've extended the bound  It will do me small good if I sink under ground  And I'm not such a fool in these projects of pelf  To humour my friends and endanger myself  MORLEY  Indeed I'd not wed for an old Uncle's whim  But here comes our Knight I shall leave you with him  As I think you've some delicate points to adjust    Exit  DECISIVE  alone  I'm in no haste to sleep with my Ancestors' dust  'Tis wiser my weak constitution to save  Than to marry and so travel post to the grave  Enter  Sir Nicholas  SIR NICHOLAS  Come give me your hand and rejoice my young neighbour  You're the man that's to order the pipe and the tabor  And by Jove we'll all dance on so joyous a day  Your wedding dear Dick shall be speedy and gay  For your rival is gone with our serious displeasure  And I give to your wishes my young lovely treasure  A treasure she is tho' the girl is my niece  Heaven grant ye long years of affection and peace  And a fine chopping boy ere the end of the first  Remember that I am to see the rogue nurs'd  Go you happy young dog go and seal with a kiss  And teach the old hall to reechoe your bliss  As I know on this match what Sir Jacob intends  And we can so well trust each other as friends  Short contracts will answer as well as the best  Our lawyers at leisure may finish the rest  I know all suspence in such cases is hard  And you shall not I swear from your bliss be debarr'd  While o'er acres of parchment they're crawling like snails  DECISIVE  Dear Sir upon weighing in Reason's just scales  Your very great favours and my weak pretension  I find I'm unworthy of such condescension  And must with regret the high honour resign  Which I once vainly thought might with justice be mine  SIR NICHOLAS  Heyday what does all this formality mean  Why Dick has the Devil possess'd you with spleen  Or has love made your mind thus with diffidence sore  False modesty ne'er was your foible before  You think you're unworthythe thought is so new  That I hardly can tell what to say or to do  If you love the good girl full as much as you said  I think you have very just claims to her bed  But if your mind's chang'd and you feel your love lighter  'Tis better to say so than marry and slight her  And if this be the case Sir you have your release  For altho' I am eager to marry my Niece  Tho' I'm partial to you yet I beg you to note  That I don't want to cram her down any man's throat  DECISIVE  I'm truly convinc'd of the Lady's perfection  And 'twould please me dear Sir to preserve the connection  Tho' now by particular reasons I'm led  To revisit the Continent once ere I wed  In the time of my absence I can't be exact  But in what form you please I will freely contract  In the course of two years to receive as my Wife  SIR NICHOLAS  Do you mean to insult me you puppy Od'slife  Ere I'd tie my dear girl to so silly a fop  For life I'd condemn her to trundle a mop  And let me advise you young man for the future  To know your own mind ere you go as a suitor  DECISIVE  I perceive Sir my presence grows irksome to you  And you'll therefore allow me to bid you adieu  SIR NICHOLAS  Your departure indeed I don't wish to restrain  And have little concern when I see you again    Exit  Decisive  SIR NICHOLAS  alone  What can make this pert puppy recede from his suit  My fair Cousin and he have scarce had a dispute  She would hardly affront him on purpose to vex me  Here she comes to explain all the points that perplex me  Enter  Mrs Felix  Well Cousin my scheme for a wedding's suspended  The Beaux are both gone and their courtship is ended  With an air so mysterious Decisive withdraws  I a little suspect you're concern'd as the cause  Confess have you had any words with this Youth  MRS FELIX  Not I my dear Sir on my honour and truth  But I'm ready to own that the news you impart  With surprize and with pleasure enlivens my heart  I think your sweet Niece has a lucky escape  I would almost as soon see her marry an ape  As her union with one of these coxcombs behold  The Bard is too warm and the Critic too cold  SIR NICHOLAS  I find that they are not such lads as I thought 'em  The world all the worst of its fashions has taught 'em  And the world is indeed at a very fine pass  When such puppies insult so attractive a lass  Young fellows of fortune now think it hard duty  To pay a chaste homage to Virtue and Beauty  But I'll leave these pert sops to their own vile caprice  And soon find a much fitter match for my Niece  Other orders of men for a husband I'll search  And I think I can settle my girl in the Church  MRS FELIX  Lord Cousin I thought you detested the Cloth  SIR NICHOLAS  Our Rector I own often kindles my wrath  But all Parsons are not like my neighbour old Squabble  Who has learnt from his geese both to hiss and to gobble  We have in our neighbourhood three young Divines  And each I believe to Selina inclines  Our Bishop's smart nephew deserves a sweet wench  He himself in due time may be rais'd to the Bench  With him I should like very well to unite her  And if he hereafter should rise to the Mitre  Then perhaps we together may bring to perfection  A muchwanted plan for the Church's correction  MRS FELIX  A very fine scheme which you'll manage no doubt  SIR NICHOLAS  More wonderful things I have known brought about  And tho' my first plan as you see has miscarried  I'm resolv'd that my Niece shall be speedily married  I'll unite the good girl to a Priest if I'm able  For the young Olive Branch never fails at his table  There is one I preferbut to leave the girl free  I allow her to make a fair choice of the three  I shall therefore invite the whole group to the hall  And I'll now go and make her write cards to them all    Exit  MRS FELIX  alone  What a wonderful creature is this worthy Knight  To make others happy is all his delight  Yet misled by some wild philanthropic illusion  He's for ever involv'd in odd scenes of confusion  'Tis well that our Critic has made his last bow  I rejoice he's remov'd and I long to know how  Enter  Morley  MORLEY  Thank my stars my dear Ma'am I've dispatch'd your commission  Your sweet friend is I hope in a tranquil condition  From her two irksome lovers she now is reliev'd  MRS FELIX  And I'm dying to know how all this was atchiev'd  Come tell me good creature how could you effect it  MORLEY  By a project so simple you'd never suspect it  I have banish'd both swains by declaring a wife  Would rob one of glory and t'other of life  I persuaded the Bard his poetical fame  Could never exist with a conjugal flame  Hence he grew with your charms so licentiously free  But forgive me this ill which I could not foresee  Decisive more wisely abandons the Fair  To make his own lungs his particular care  MRS FELIX  What on such points as these have they taken your word  MORLEY  Dear Madam mankind credit things most absurd  When they come from the mouth of a medical man  Hence Mountebanks never want skill to trepan  The extent of our empire indeed there's no seeing  When we act on the fears of a true selfish being  MRS FELIX  How simple soever the means you've employ'd  You have remedy'd ills by which we were annoy'd  Having thus clear'd the scene from each troublesome lover  Can you not for the nymph a fit husband discover  You see how she's prest by her Uncle to wed  Who ne'er quits a scheme he once takes in his head  Suppose her kind fancy should lean towards you  Is your heart quite as free as I'm sure 'twould be true  Is it not preengag'd  MORLEY  As in mirth's sportive sally  It pleases you thus a poor pilgrim to rally  Your goodnature I know will forgive me if I  To your pleasantry make a too serious reply  'Tis my maxim to speak whatsoe'er be the theme  With a heart undisguis'd to the friends I esteem  Had I all India's wealth 'twould be my inclination  To offer it all to your lovely relation  But supposing it possible you could be willing  To unite her with one who is scarce worth a shilling  Believe me dear Madam my pride is too great  To wish her to stoop to my humble estate  MRS FELIX  Such pride tho' it rests upon no strong foundation  Is noble I own and deserves admiration  I call it illfounded because in my mind  If there's fortune enough for a couple when join'd  If talents and worth are by each duly shar'd  If in all other points they are equally pair'd  And mutual regard mutual merit enhances  It signifies not which supply'd their finances  MORLEY  Your pardonhow often when fortune's unequal  Gay weddings produce a most turbulent sequel  But could I once hope your sweet Cousin to gain  How many things are there such hopes to restrain  Suppose your dear Colonel my most noble friend  Whom success to your arms may more speedily send  Suppose having clos'd the bright work he has plan'd  His return from the East he should hasten by land  Suppose him arriv'd with what face could I meet  The man whom my heart should exultingly greet  If he found me attempting in spite of my station  To wed tho' a beggar your wealthy relation  MRS FELIX  From these words my dear friend which I almost adore  And a few slighter hints that escap'd you before  I have caught a quick hope which is fraught with delight  That I soon shall be blest with my Felix's sight  I begin to suspect he's in England already  I perceive that you can't keep your countenance steady  With his usual attention his love has reflected  How my poor foolish nerves by surprize are affected  And lest they should fail me beyond all revival  Has sent you to prepare for his wish'dfor arrival  Am I right in my guess Is he not very near  Could I trust my own heart I should think Felix here  COLONEL FELIX  entering  Sweet foreboder behold him restor'd to your arms  MRS FELIX  O my Felix this transport o'erpays all alarms  Thus to see thee restor'd and ennobled with fame  In what words shall affection thy welcome proclaim  COLONEL  My Love my best Treasure than glory more dear  The bliss of this meeting which shines in thy tear  That we owe to this friend let us never forget  MORLEY  My share in your transport o'erpays all the debt  But Colonel your fondness has travell'd full speed  And has not allow'd me the time you agreed  COLONEL  I meant not indeed to have join'd you today  But I found love forbade my intended delay  MORLEY  Well my duty is done now you happily meet  Heaven bless you together  MRS FELIX  Stay stay I entreat  You must not go yet and before you depart  I will open to Felix the scheme of my heart  SELINA  behind the scene  Indeed Sir I never can write such a card  SIR NICHOLAS  behind the scene  Then you'll forfeit at once my paternal regard  COLONEL  Heyday in the house I much fear something's wrong  As Sir Nicholas talks in a language so strong  MRS FELIX  Does he know you are here  COLONEL  No my dear I think not  Unless he the tidings from Jenny has got  She alone saw me come and without much ado  Most kindly directed me where to find you  MRS FELIX  They are coming this waylet's withdraw all together  And contrive how to turn this loud storm to fair weather    Exeunt  Enter  Sir Nicholas  and  Selina  SIR NICHOLAS  I insist on your writing such cards to them all  SELINA  Dear Uncle I beg you'll this order recall  You know your commands I much wish to obey  But reflect on this matter what people will say  You're so eager to marry your Niece they will swear  That you hawk her about just like goods at a fair  SIR NICHOLAS  Well my dear let 'em say so and I'll say so too  For your simile proves what a guardian should do  He who wants to dispose of a tender young maid  May take a good hint from the gingerbread trade  If he has any sense 'twill be ever his plan  To part with soft pastry as soon as he can  For egad an old maid is like old harden'd paste  You may cry it about but nobody will taste  Come do as I bid you and take up your pen  SELINA  Lord Sir it will seem very odd to these men  You will make me appear in a horrible light  I vow my hand shakes so I never can write  Excuse me dear Sir from this business pray do  And let me live single for ever with you  SIR NICHOLAS  All business where woman's concern'd I believe  Must partake of the curse from our grandmother Eve  All her daughters the steps of their parent have follow'd  Contradiction the core of the apple she swallow'd  In their veins still fermenting new ills can produce  And all their blood seems coloquintida juice  You froward cross baggage your word should I take  And bid you live single five years for my sake  Of the barbarous Uncle you'd quickly complain  Who from nature's just right a young girl wou'd restrain  SELINA  Indeed Sir I should not  SIR NICHOLAS  I tell you you wou'd  From perverseness alone you oppose your own good  'Tis only to thwart me because I desire  To see you well settled before I expire  That you now with your soft hypocritical carriage  Affect to have no inclination to marriage  But you'll never contrive tho' your tongue may be nimble  To convince me your heart is as cold as your thimble  I know of what stuff froward damsels are made  The guardian must force you who cannot persuade  That you'll like a good husband I never can doubt  And married you shall be before the month's out  Or at least your kind Uncle no more you shall teaze  But may e'en go to Rome and turn nun if you please  SELINA  aside  I have lost all the love he has shewn me for years  If I strive to reply I shall burst into tears  SIR NICHOLAS  Come answer me Miss will you scribble or not  Enter the  Colonel Mrs Felix  and  Morley  COLONEL  My worthy old friend what can make you so hot  SIR NICHOLAS  Ha Colonelyou find me a little concern'd  But I'm heartily glad you are safely return'd  Your arrival indeed is a welcome surprize  Tho' before you your fame a bright harbinger flies  We have heard your success and we all triumph in it  COLONEL  I trust I am come in a fortunate minute  To make all your present embarrassment cease  For I bring a young husband my friend for your Niece  SIR NICHOLAS  Egad that's well said and I'm sure it's well meant  And if he's like you he shall have my consent  COLONEL  He has many more virtues and just as much wealth  And from India brings home both his morals and health  Here my friend is the manAs I owe him my life  I wish to present him so lovely a wife  Half my fortune is hishere I freely declare it  And have only to hope that Selina my share it  I've regarded her long as a child of my own  Nor can my affection more truly be shown  Than by wishing to place the dear girl in the arms  Of the friend whose rare virtues are worthy her charms  MORLEY  Dear generous Felix I'm quite overcome  Thy bounty is such it strikes gratitude dumb  COLONEl  This was ever my friend my most settled intention  Though my very just purpose I chose not to mention  From the hope I should find what I gladly embrace  A moment from which it may borrow some grace  When my gift its plain value may rise far above  By the aid it affords to the wishes of love  And I own as a prophet I'm proud of my art  Now I see the effects of her charms on your heart  MORLEY  O Felix can I thus deprive thy free spirit  Of wealth the reward of heroical merit  Can I the victorious Commander despoil  Of what he has purchas'd with danger and toil  Should love and delight on thy present attend  I could never be happy in robbing a friend  No I still must decline  SIR NICHOLAS  My dear boy say no more  You're the match that I never could meet with before  I have long sought in vain for an heir to my mind  But all my soul wish'd in your spirit I find  You shall  not  rob your friend of a single  An Indian Coin  Gold Moor  He can raise heirs enough to inherit his store  To such men as himself let him haste to give birth  And with twenty young Felix's garnish the earth  How trifling soever your fortune may be  From the Colonel's esteem and the virtues I see  I think you as noble a match for my Niece  As I could had you brought home a new golden fleece  I have money enough if you're rich in affection  As I always have talk'd of an equal connection  My neighbours perhaps may suppose my sight dim  Or mock my wise choice as a generous whim  Let them study with zeal which I hope may succeed  Of their horses and dogs to improve the best breed  A study more noble engrosses my mind  To preserve the first points in the breed of mankind  On the heart and the soul as the first points I dwell  In these my dear Children you match mighty well  And I think human nature in debt to my care  For uniting two mortals who happily pair  COLONEL  Your hand my dear Knight it is gloriously said  SIR NICHOLAS  By Juno we'll put the young Couple to bed  We'll have no dull delays  MRS FELIX  Now what say you my dear  Are these orders for marriage too quick and severe  MORLEY  My amazement and gratitude both are extreme  But my voice seems opprest in a heavenly dream  Though your kindness is greater than language can paint  I beg this fair hand may be free from constraint  SIR NICHOLAS  From constraintGad if now she affects to demur  I can tell her my wrath she will so far
