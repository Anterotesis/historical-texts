 AN ESSAY At Removing  National Prejudices  AGAINST A UNION with  ENGLAND  PART III By the Author of the two first  Printed in the Year MDCCVI  AN ESSAY At Removing National Prejudices c  HAving wrote two Essays in  England  upon the Subject of the Union and particularly to remove National and Party Prejudices against the Treaty then on foot I calculated those Essays principally for the  English  part where I always expected the difficulty would lye and where I met with certain radicated tho ill grounded Prejudices against the  Scots as a Nation  as well as against the Union which I thought a general Happiness  But I confess my self surpriz'd when coming to  Edinburgh  on some private Affairs of my own I found my two Essays Reprinted here and forwardly handed about as Arguments against that very Subject they were written to Promote I mean the Union and that only upon this weak Supposition that because I had only insisted upon the Advantages to  England  in Union that therefore I did not pretend  Scotland  should any way be better'd by it  To this my Answer is very short that I had always too great a respect for the  Scots  to write a Satyr upon the Nation And that thinking it impossible any  Scotsman  could be  to seek in the real numerous and so visible Advantages  Scotland  shall reap by the Treaty I thought it would seem to reflect too much upon the Gentlemen concern'd to presume to tell them what it was much better manners for me to presume they all knew already and what by the nature of the Thing became so visible that to me it seem'd none but the willfully Blind  whom I do not pretend to Cure  could be at a loss about  But since it is my misfortune to be thus mistaken and that some People charge me with that Ignorance which my respect for their Understanding would not permitt me to charge them with I find my self oblig'd  contrary to my fixt resolution of not medling on either side  to make this short Essay on the respective Advantages of  Scotland  in the depending Treaty of Union and this I shall do as concisely as I can and carefully avoiding needless Digressions come immediately to the Matter in hand  Only before I begin the attempt give me leave in duty to the Government and in defference to her Majesty to note that the expressions of Advantages accruing to  Scotland  by the Union are so plain in her Majesty's Royal Letter and so asserted in the respective Speeches of his Grace the Lord Commissioner and the Lord Chancellor at the opening the present Session of Parliament that one would think no Man could read that Letter and those Speeches and ask afterwards what the Advantages to  Scotland  shall be by the Union  When her Majesty tells her Subjects of  Scotland  She  is fully persuaded it will prove the greatest Happiness of her People that it will be the solid Foundation of lasting Peace it will secure your Religion Liberty and Property remove the Animosities amongst your selves and  the Jealousies and Differences betwixt Our two Kingdoms It must increase your Strength Riches and Trade and by this Union the whole Island being joyn'd in Affection and free from all apprehension of different Interests will be enabled to resist all its Enemies support the Protestant Interest every where and maintain the Liberties of  Europe  That to bring this Union to pass is the only effectual way to secure your present and future Happiness and disappoint the Designs of your and her Majesty's Enemies  When his Grace her Majestie's high Commissioner has inculcated these things and reminds you  That the Queen esteems it as the greatest Glory of her Reign not her glorious Successes abroad excepted to have this mighty Affair concluded  When my Lord Chancellor tells you  You have now the opportunity of establishing for your selves and Posterity by this Union all that concerns your Religion and Liberties and the most valuable Privileges of Trade  After all this has been said is it not hard Gentlemen you should ask a poor Stranger here what  Scotland  shall get by this Union and why I did not go upon that in my former Essays  Really Gentlemen when I wrote those Essays I conceiv'd them of use to  Scotland  to convince some unbelieving  Englishmen  that your great Advantages should be no injury to them It was a loud and continued Cry there  Ay ay we know the  Scots  will gain by this Union  but what SHALL WE  we in England  be the better for it And I was challeng'd often to make out what the  English  should Gain by it  Upon this I undertook that Subject and really there lies some unhappiness in the alternative of this Matter and an impartial Writer  as I hope I may pretend to be  has a great difficulty before him in urging the Advantages of either Nation since the Arguments to prove the Advantages of one seem to argue the Disadvantages of the other  My remedy for this is what I have undertaken in another place  viz  To convince both Parties that their Advantages are mutual reciprocal and so equal that 'tis hard to determine which side shall be the greater Gainer  And this happy conjunction of good Events I must confess comes to pass from a thing many People have not without plenty of Ignorance opposed I mean the Union's being CENTERAL And as to all the essential parts of Constitution Universal so that we are at liberty to give that Word its full extent UNION And here I think it can not be improper to explain how extensive I think  the word Union  to be in this Case and how  even by the Treaty  it ought to be understood It is a word comprehensive of every thing Good to both exclusive of all manner of Preference or Disparity of Parts abhorring all things Injurious or Diminishing to either a full Coallition a general Incorporation of Nations of Interests of Power and of SafetyA Sameness of Circumstances and of Sympathies becoming one and the same Body with one and the same Head Life Soul Nutriment Point and Period  Some Gentlemen who talk much of this Union and having known the Heads of it yet pretend not to understand it would do very well to turn to their Books and putting together all the Etymologies receiv'd Significations customary Acceptations and common readings of the words  Union  and  Incorporation  tell us what they understand by  them and how the true meaning of the Words and the new suggestions of separate Existence in the Government can Consist  But if this be too nice and the Thought too much sublimated for them let me recommend to them a course Simily  I liken this Union to a Body receiving Food as Flesh Fish Fruit Liquids  c  All which being incorporated and digested concoct together Unite their very Substance and dissolve themselves into one and the same Nutriment to the health life vigour and growth of the whole Body proportionedly and universally  If wrong Digestion distemper of the Body or defect of the Food produces corruption contagion or improper fermentation the most remote Member and the nearest or more immediate equally feel their proportion'd want of Nourishment decay of Strength distemper and disorder the deficiency cannot be felt in the Head and not in the Foot but weakness succeeds to all the Parts  If our Union be Partial Federal Periodical or indeed Notional as most of those schemes have been then the defects may be so also One part may thrive and another decay And  Scotland  would be but too sensible of that in those sorts of Union  But if the Union be an Incorporation a Union according to the extent of the Letter it must then be a Union of the very SOUL OF THE NATION all its Constitution Customs Trade and Manners must be blended together digested and concocted for the mutual united undistinguish't good growth and health of the one whole united Body and this I understand by Union And no wonder they who consider the Nations in a less  or more contracted Capacity of Union are at a loss to find the Advantages of it  Now Gentlemen as thus United would you know your Advantages They consist of four sorts  Trade  Religion  Civil Government  Liberty and Soveraignty  In Trade the united Riches Stocks Settlements Factories and Dependencies of  England  are concern'd to promote yours not as their Sister  Scotland  but as their own Riches Stocks in Trade  c  Not in a separate but an immediate Capacity their Ports are yours and you are immediately Naturalized to and Legitimated in their CustomeHouses Ports and Commerce Your Manfuactures are Carried to them and what you want Imported from them without Taxes Tolls Distinction or Interruption  If the  Indies  lyes at your Door and you want Stock to Grasp that Sea of wealth the Fishery your Fish and their Stocks will Unite to fall into that useful affair by which  your People  will be Employed  your Seamen  kept at home  your Provision  consumed  your Lands  Improved  your Nation  Enriched they shareing with you in every one of these and you with them in every other Advantage  'Twill be endless to Essay on the Freedom of your Linen Manufacture into  England  and it's prodigous Increass by the taking off the Exorbitant Duty now laid upon it the Freedom of an Immediate Trade to all Our Colonies denied  Even to the English Subjects Inhabiting Ireland  The flush Stocks of  English Men  falling into Trade with you and  the Currency and Flux of  English  Bullion and Coin into all parts of your Kingdom  'Twould be worth your considering the advantages of Introduceing  English Improvements  on your Estates and perhaps  English  Farmers and Stocks on your Lands the Exportation of your Corn and Coals to  English  Mercats And whether it will not be your own fault if these things do not in a few Years double the Fee simple and raise the Value of your Estates  Two for One  These are a few of the Advantages in Trade which would bear a higher enlargement if it needed that I should first prove this would keep your People at home and then Examine the infinite Alterations and Consequences both to LandTrade and ready Mony which doubling or trebbling the number of your People would produce  'Tis a Slander upon your Country to say '  tis a Barren Land  Nature was commanded not to let Man have his Bread out of her but by the Sweat of his Brows and with that Sweat she never denys him  'Tis want of Trade to whet Industry Profit to whet Trade Vent of Goods and Stock to produce Profit These are the Barrennesses your Country Complains of and Declines for want of  Your Lands Enclosed Manured and Cultivated would be  as Rich  your Cattel  as Large  your Sheep  as Fat  and your Wool  as Fine  as in  England  your Barren Muirs would yield Corn the Hills Feed Flocks of Sheep and your better Lands which you now wholly Imploy with the Plough would Feed Strong and Valuable Cattel from hence would proceed  Darys  Milk Butter Cheese c which being plentiful and Cheap would feed your Poor in a better manner and deliver them from the Misery and  Hardship which now makes your People fly from their Native Country and makes you the Nurses of  Europe  that you have the trouble and expense of your Children till they are grown up and then other Nations reap the Profit of their Labour  But I can but touch these things here perhaps I may more largely Discourse of both the evil and its remedy on another occasion But to bring it to the present purpose the immediate Remedy for them is an UNION and as it is the only Remedy so it must be a Remedy you must partake of the general Improvement both in Land Living and Trade and I need say no more  The  English  Powers must be your Defence the whole  English  Wealth must be Engaged to you the  English  Navys must be your Convo  s and in all parts of the World your Ships have the Immediate Protection of their Fleet Ports Forts▪ and Forces And this by the natural Consequences of the UNION not as you are their Friends Neighbours and Confederates But as you are themselves their own it is become a Debt to you their Subjects must Pay it or be Traytors to their Soveraign and to their Native Country which is yours and theirs Indefinitely and Undistinguisht  I know some Gentlemen will allow all this much rather than be convinced of equal Advantages in another yet more valuable Case viz Religion which is the Second head of Discourse  And here I must own I am astonisht that any one can help seeing the Safety Settlement and Perpetuity of the Establisht Church of  Scotland  entirely wrapt up in the UNION and indeed only to be secured by it  H  therto you have been jealous of  England  putting upon you Episcopacy Tyrany c And I cannot say 'tis  without cause and in case of Ruptures War diferent Soveraigns and a Thousand Casualties and uncertainties to which the Church as now Established is subject both from  England  without as distinctly and disunitedly consider'd  Which after the Queen no Body can answer for  and from a numerous and doubly Disaffected Party at Home Who I say in case of those things shall Answer for what may or may not befal the present Establisht Church▪ I dare say no Man that has a true Zeal for it can say he is easy in the present condition of the Church abstracted from this Union  Upon an Union all these Fears vanish 'Tis for ever rendered impossible to Overthrow the Settlement of the Presbyterian Church of  Scotland  But by Subverting the constitution by absolute Arbitrary Government and the openest BareFac'd Tyranny The Church and the constitution the Spiritual and Temporal Liberty have the same Sanction Subsist and Depend upon the same Security are Defended by the same Power Demanded by the same Right Twisted and Connected together cannot fall but by the same Disaster Nor stand but by the Support of one another  'Tis true Tyrannies may happen and so they may and are much more likly to do under your present Unsettled posture as to Succession than otherwise And therefore you will still be more Safe than you are now And with this addition that then all  Brittain  will be concern'd for your Liberty and you will demand it as your undoubted indisputable Right Which Right the other can never consent to Abrogate or make Null without making it lawful by the same Majority to lose their own and so  should one day come to suffer by the same experiment▪  And indeed this is the only way to reconcile that strange absurdity of which I have taken notice else where now growing up in both Nations viz  The Danger of the Church  that  England  should say her Church will be in Danger and  Scotland  say her Church will be in Danger If both these can be true I confess it has something very odd in it But what is yet more absurd is that this should be from a Union Bless us Union work this How can this be 'Tis the nature of Union to preserve not distroy to secure not endanger to confirm not Undermine  No Gentlemen  if either of your Churches are in Danger it will be for want of the Union So and no other way the absurdity may be reconciled and both Churches be in Danger  In Union  Love Peace Charity and Mutual Assistance are natural consequences And can those pull down any Church Whenever either party attempts upon the other the Union is Broke 'Tis no more the thing and can no longer bear the Name When the Union is Broke the Constitution is Overthrown For one link of this Chain being Broken the whole Chain is rendred useless the Force of the one depending upon the continuity of the rest The fundamental is distroy'd the Government dissolves and the whole Island becomes a Mob one Universal Rabble Just as in the case of a Tyrant dispensing with the Laws and Setting up Arbitrary Power Property ceases Authority Dissolves Constitution suffocates and the National Capacity dyes  'Tis true Human Wisdom can make nothing Indissolvible This Union may be broke so may  Magna Carta  So may the Constitution But Gentlemen you have the same  Security for your Church Settlement that you have for your Lives Liberties and Estates and the same on one side that you have on another  But says one fill'd with jealousies of remote possibilities even The Legislature may be byast and a Parliament may come that shall Rescind the Settlement of the Church of Scotland c  Put this into English  A Parliament may come that may Dissolve the Constitution that may Rescind the Union that may Sacrifice the whole Kingdom  it is absurd in it's nature the Union in it's being is the very Constitution the Life and Soul of Great  Brittain  as to Government And to say a Parliament may come that can break the Constitution is to say a Parliament may be mad possest and  Felo de se  as a Parliament they can not do so they cease from that moment to be a Parliament and become a House of Tyrants and a Den of Robbers nay and of the worst sort of Robbers Stripping those they come to Protect  If they would do this therefore they can not without Dissolving their own Being Annihilating their own Body and committing all Imaginable Absurdities  They may Dissolve themselves but Original natural Right must remain if they dissolve the Form  whether shall it return  To its primitive State it cannot because that is dissolv'd to Confusion it must not because Right must be preserved Whenever therefore a Parliament destroys the Constitution by which a Nation is Form'd that Parliament ceases and Power reverts to its original Source to Form a new One  Thus the Nature of the thing is its own Security and there needs no addition of other Force if there does the Mouths of those Gentlemen must be stopt in his Grace the  high Commissioner's Speech  viz  That his Grace is impowered to Consent to what may be farther Necessary  What can be made more Firm Are there any ligaments in the Law qualified to bind the Church and the Constitution together so as that One cannot be hurt without the Other  they are offered you  take them and tie it as fast as Laws or Oaths can bind or the  Sacra Imperii  of any Nation be made  After this what shall we say is there any thing in the Scruples of some in either of the Establisht Churches which goes beyond the real Security of the Church  I wish those Gentlemen would examine whether it be any more than a Scruple And whether all the Obligation they think themselves under is not limited by Possibilities Whether it can be understood they should be bound to do that which they cannot really wish  the Publick Good and present Circumstances considered  were in their power to do  Let such Gentlemen consider how far their Sincerity as well as Judgment will be called in question in this Case  Whether really securing the Church which they embrace as truly and only Orthodox be not the most effectual step they can take to pull down all false Churches and consequently a full Discharge of the sacred Obligation they think themselves under  'Tis certain as things are the Church of  Scotland  is far from Safe and I should be excusable if I should say nothing but Miracle or a Union can make her so He then that effectually Establishes the true Church of Christ in the World effectually suppresses and pulls down all other Churches in the language of his Capacity as he assists to place that Church in a posture of Victory over all her Enemies  by a liberty of using all her spiritual Weapons  viz  The superiour Doctrine and sanctity of her Ministry and I wish there were no other Contention between the two Churches  If the Church of  Scotland  is now in a precarious unsafe and unsettled Condition and may be Secured by the Union then the Members of this Church can no more ask me what they Gain by the Union nor answer it to their Consciences or their Posterity that they should oppose her Settlement in this the day of her Establishment  But say the Gentlemen that in behalf of the Church argue against the Union as now proposed  We in  Scotland  are not safe by the Union  for we are deprived of our Parliament and  delivered over  to the Parliament of  England  and  we do not know  but such a Time may come when the Parliament of  England whose Constitution is wholly Episcopal  may Vote our Church down and Erect the Episcopal Church of  England  as the Establishment of great  Britain  putting us off in  Scotland  with a Toleration which also they may by an occasional Bill Reduce again to any thing they please  This I take to be the summ and state of the Question For really what the other Party objects in my opinion carries with it no weight  To argue what an  English  or  British  Parliament may do and what they may not do seems to me to be so conjectural that it leaves no room to call it an Argument And let Opinion go which way it will or Probability byass which way it will this will follow 'tis as possible and I must ask pardon for thinking that 'tis more probable a  Scots  Parliament may be obtain'd to ruine Presbytery than an  English  And I shall turn the very same Arguments which are used against this Matter upon the Gentlemen  that use them  thus  The strong Reasons given why an  English  Parliament may do this are such as these  The great Interest of the Church of  England  and her influence in the Parliament Her having prevail'd to continue the TestAct impose it on the  Irish  Dissenters and attempt it on the Colonies Her power to influence Elections in both Kingdoms the nearness to carrying the occasional Bill Her strong struggles for it the easiness to Bribe or take off the Members  c  The Reasons why there is no danger from a  Scots  Parliament are such as these  That the Act making it Treason to impugn any Article of the Claim of Right makes it dangerous to attempt it in the Parliament of  Scotland  That the Nobility and Gentry of  Scotland  are too sensible of the Calamities formerly brought upon the Nation have suffered too much by them to offer at Embroiling the Nation again upon that account  That the example of the Parliament chosen after King  William  's death is an Argument for this in which an Author says there were more HighChurchmen Elected than in any Parliament since the Restorationwho were so far from restoring Episcopacy that they would not allow the Episcopal Clergy the Toleration they Petitioned for  This as the summ of the projected Disparity is what is now offered upon this Head which in short I abridge thus '  tis a Comparison of Probabilities  That 'tis probable from both Circumstances and Examples that the  English  Parliament may Undo the Church Settlement of  Scotland  but 'tis not probable the Parliament of  Scotland  can do it  This I desire to speak briefly to and if I should chance to turn the scale of Probabilities against them then I leave it to it's Consequences whether the World will not give it against these Gentlemen who with their Imperfect Union are for leaving us just where they found us or worse  That the Parliament of  England  is composed of Church Men is true and that the Parsons tho not near  as is said  Vote and the Church may Influence Elections very much is all true and yet under all this and under such Reigns as in which the Dissenters in  England  have been most hated they could never obtain any Effectual Law to suppress them And at last the Poweer of Truth and the Reason and Nature of things so prevailed that the Dissenters are not only Secur'd but the whole Nation is come over to them in the Doctrines of Government Right and Liberty  The Dissenters are not gone back an Inch but the Church asham'd of their Persecutions and Oppressions  which like Excentrick motions always revolve of Course to regularities and more Natural Rules  return'd again by length of time to her self and own'd her Error Declar'd Persecution against her Principles and freely fall in with Tolleration and Liberty  They see the Dissenters and the Church have but one Civil Interest and that Liberty is the Safety of both they're Convinc'd not Conquerd reduc't not by Power or Party but by the nature of things they come to their Senses again  After this upon another Sally under a  HighChurchMinistry  the Test was foisted upon the Dissenters in  Ireland  and some extravagancies Acted in  England  but mark how soon did these Attempts in the Authors blow up the Ministry and meer Nature bring all things to Rights again  To instance in the Attempt on the Colonies which is the story of  Carolina  me thinks is very odd since to read the misfortune of my Lord  Grlle  on that Head with what contempt he has been treated and how mortified for offering such a thing but on a poor handful of Planters me thinks I say it should strangely weaken the Arguments of those who seem to suggest these things  These People seem to me a little Infatuated and to Argue against themselves for in order to Prove that such a certain thing as attempting the Supression of Presbytry may come to pass they bring upon the Stage all the Instances of these attempts in which the People attempting have miscarried and can tell but one in which they Succeeded viz the putting the Test upon  Ireland which by the way  had never past neither had not the Dissenters in meer self denial for the Publick Good rested under the hardship rather than venture to lose the Bill against the growth of Popery a thing these Gentlemen I suppose knew nothing of and a Generosity the other Party are but very little acquainted with  'Tis hard now Gentlemen that because the HighflyingChurchMen have always attempted the Dissenters in  England  and miscarried to argue from thence that therefore they shall insult the  Scots  Settlement and succeed I think it had been a much stronger way of Arguing to say that being unable with their united strength ever to gain upon the Dissenters in  England  who by their own Calculation  are not above one to twelve they shall certainly be the less able to prevail when in conjunction with the  Scots  Interest and Members  As to the occasional Bill and the nearness of its being pass'd 'tis plain it was a surprize the snare was not seen at first but with what indignation the reserves and secret designs against the Dissenters were treated when discovered I leave to the Reader to find in the Journals of both Houses  From hence we come to the Probabilities on the other hand  viz  That there is no danger of the  Scots  Parliament being seduced the same Author grants the new and may be bought by the  English  Court but the whole Parliament cannot be soand yet I believe most People will join in this that let the Court at any time be sure to buy and in either Parliament they shall generally speaking carry any thing they desire so that this is absurd and by no means a just way of Arguing  Another contradiction takes off very much of the Credit of this kind of Arguing  viz  That the Act making it Treason to impugn any Article of the Claim of Right makes it dangerous to attempt this in the Parliament of  Scotland  I cannot but be surpriz'd to find any Man can say this is not an Argument just the other way that it is not as lawful a Security to the Church of  Scotland  in the  English  Parliament or in the Parliament of  Britain  as in that of  Scotland  Is not this Act to remain in Force after the Union and may it not be made a part of the Treaty and can the Parliament  of  Britain  Vote what is declared by the Treaty to be high Treason to attempt 'tis certainly as great a Security to the Church of  Scotland  as can be desir'd that 'tis declar'd high Treason to impugn her Settlement  Shall it be objected that the Parliament of  Britain  may Repeal this I answer and so may the Parliament of  Scotland  whenever they please as it now stands but if made a Capitulation of the Treaty according to my notion of the Treaty it can never be altered but by meer Tyranny Perjury Violence and Usurpation  This is the present Security of the Presbyterian Church of  Scotland  she is Establish't by Parliament the Soveraign is Sworn not to alter it and 'tis high Treason in the Subject to attempt it and all this made a Stipulation previous to the Treaty which cannot be broken If this be not Security sufficient I should be glad to see something better offered to the high Commissioner that according to his Grace's Speech it may be past into such a Law as may make them fully easy  It is unhappy that the Gentlemen who argue on this Head will allow the Church of  England  or the Court or both may have an influence over the whole Parliament of  Britain  but cannot have an influence over the so much smaller Parliament of  Scotland  I have heard it suggested by the Enemies of the Nation of the  Scots  that they are Poor and Mercenary and may be all bought by the Court with  l  If this slander be true 'tis first a sign that the present Government in  England  does not Bribe them now Secondly 'tis plain that they are not to be Brib'd into the Union for that the Money has not produc'd the Effect yet and the Court of  England  or highChurch have not on all occasions bought such Bills as they have had occasion for  On the other hand these Gentlemen put so little stress on the Votes in the House of Commons in  Britain  that they think they may be always out Voted and the  Scots  may have bad luck to have no Friends in the House of Commons but their own  Now this is the very pretence on the other part of the Question in  England  where the Gentlemen put us in mind how fatal  Scots  Members may be to the Church in conjunction with the Whigs there and I am in some seeming straight in pushing either part of the Argument both sides taking hold of it If I say in  England  they are too few to Hurt us then say the  Scots  they are to few to Secure us If I say in  Scotland  they are enough to Secure you then say they in  England  they are enough to Hurt us  This is a very unhappy Case and the Artifices of our Writers on this Head seem very mean here they are forc'd to run counter against one another and make such shifts turns and doubles to bring things to bear as I can not but wonder at  The  English  Court  say they  may Bribe the Members and Lords in the Parliament of  Britain  and they may join with their Counties Enemies to betray  Scotland  But in the  Scots  Parliament they pretend they are safe and the Church will be Secured by them for  they  cannot be Brib'd Bought or Byasst  Again the Court may get all Episcopal Men to Represent the Kingdom of  Scotland  at the Parliament of  Britain  But they can get none that will so much as agree to a Toleration of Episcopacy while they belong to the Parliament in  Scotland  so that to Day they may be Brib'd to  Morrow they can not to Day they may be all Episcopal Men to Morrow they will be a Security against Episcopacy  Now take the highChurchMen in  England  and their Absurdities are not fewer than these to Day they tell us  Scots  Men will bring Presbytery into  England  and pull down the Church to Morrow the Dissenters in  England  are not one to twelve and we must force the  Scots  to restore the Church Thus one way a thing is Great and another way Small one way Secure and another way in Danger  Now let us place these People one against another in each Kingdom In  England    Scots  Commoners and Lords will certainly bring in Presbytery and pull down the Church of  England  in  Scotland  they will join to bring in Episcopacy being brib'd and bought to pull down the Church of  Scotland  To Day they are so many they will endanger the  English  Church to Morrow so few they can't defend their own  To Day they will be so true to Presbytery they will never leave Caballing to pull down Episcopacy to Morrow so false they will sell their Country join in voting Episcopacy up in  Scotland  and reduce the present Church to a Toleration  These things are very counfounding and no Man can be prepar'd to debate with Men that will thus go upon all manner of Possibilities  I confess in my weak Observation I think they come all from the same Fountain and are agitated by the same Spirit  I mean  from  England  where a vigorous Party struggles against the Union of the Kingdoms as the only mischief can befall their HighChurch Cause and effectually  deprive them of the opportunities of Embroiling both Nations  I wish this Kingdom a little better inform'd of the practices of those People and entirely deliver'd from their Influence I observe all or most part of the Pamphlets against the Union are form'd in  England  and sent from thence in which the Authors suggest things falfe in Fact presuming upon the distance of the Place and that they shall be taken upon their words  They represent the Union as a thing which depends wholly upon the Parliament in this Kingdom andthe  English  entirely acquiescing in the matter nay some have represented it as a thing the  English  are courting and wheedling this Kingdom to in order to bring them under and that there is nothing to do but to get the  Scots  to comply with it  In order to this every  Englishman  here whether by his Curiosity private Affairs or by whatever other occasion brought here is rendred suspected as if sent from  England  as an Emissary to officiate here in preparing the  Scots  to their purpose  I do believe that in  England  there is a general happy disposition to this Union especially in the wisest best and gteatest part of that Kingdom and that this Temper is exceedingly promoted and encreased by her Majestie's steady adherence to it as the only means to secure the Peace and Happiness of both Nations and as much as possible crushing checking and discouraging the Party that are against it And I do acknowledge to believe that this happy disposition is such at this time that if the Parliament of  Scotland  closes with it and no unreasonable difficulties are raised from hence it will be compleated there  But I intreate the Gentlemen on this side to bear with me in telling them this happy temper in  England  has not been so easy a thing to procure Abundance of visible Providences have been remarkably Concurring to bring this Conjuncture to such a Crisis Great havock has been made by their own follies in the interest of a party under an administration that would never have made the attempt  Victories of various sorts have contributed to the work and a connexion of wonders have brought it to pass a conquest at home superiour to  Blenheim  or  Ramellies  has been made over the dividing spirits of the high party Peace and Union has made large strides and rid over the Bellies of her vanquisht Enemies Envy Malice Jealousy and party strife  The Queen nay the very Bishops too have been called a thousand Presbyterians Deserters of the Church and all that is Scandalous Every Moderate Church Man has been a Confessor in this Cause and gone thro' Scandal Reproach and all sorts of Opposition for Espousing it  What Tacking what Projecting what Caballing have the Party Attempted as the Struggles of their Wicked Cause and with what Difficulty has this Juncture been brought to pass  Nor are the Party yet in Dispare but with all Imaginable Vigour and Artifice they carry on their Dying Cause and D  pute Inch by Inch every StepThe last Game they have to Play is the Union if they can not Destroy that they own the Union will Destroy them and I am very sory to see the Subtilty of their Proceeding extends hither  They leave no Stone untur'nd they Play Whiggs against Whiggs and Church against Church Presbyterians against  Presbyterians They amuse with Jealousies on one hand raise Scruples on the other in  England  they Rail Gibe and Banter in  Scotland  they Plead those very things for arguments which they own their aversion to  Now I would humbly recommend to these Gentlemen here in  Scotland  who really are for secureing their Church how comes Church of  England  Men High Church hot Episcoparian Disputants to talk of your security Does the Fox Preach  Garde les Poules  have a care of the Geese  Why is it they talk so much of the security of the Church and fill your Heads with fear of the Church whence must this fear come it must come from the  English  Pray Gentlemen how comes it to pass that in  England  all your Friends are against you and all your Enemies are for you By  You  I mean  You  Objectors  All the High Church Men all the Enemies of your Improvement the Enemies of your Trade and the Enemies of your Church are Enemies of the Union they throng you with their Pamphlets and Cant of Securities Those very Men who wish your Church and perhaps Nation too at the  Dl  are turn'd about and talk of the Security of the Church the very  Jure Divino  Men talk of Liberty the very Instruments of former Tyrannys in  England  talk of Preserving your Laws Parliaments and Judicatorys  This is really so Mysterious that I think it's worth your Observation and no doubt but you will find good reason from it to quicken your Application to the Union  I shall close this Essay with two thinges for I cannot have room to enter upon the Civil Advantages  His Grace the hihg Commissioner has Acquainted you that he is Impowred to pass Laws for the further Securing this Matter in order as I suppose to make you Easy and remove the  Scruples and Fears of those really concerned for the Church  Now in laying hold of her Majesties offer by His Grace the High Commissioner here and the like in  England  there seems to me to be one ready Step to make both sides easie and to remove the Jealousies on either hand as to the Danger of the Church whether Presbyterian or Episcopal and the Matter is very short viz That an Act of Parliament be past in the respective Kingdoms Containing a Claim of Church Rights a Declaration of the State of either Church its Constitution and Government with a formal Capitulation or Clause of Establishment for either Church and proper Provisions Articles and Limitations between them Declareing their Powers and Extent Which Acts being first Past in either Kingdom be afterwards Incorporated into and made part of the Treaty as an Essential Condition of the said Union and this no Doubt will be Granted  To say this may be Cass'd Annull'd or afterwards made Void seems Invidious and is to my Apprehension Talking nothing at all for no Subsequent Parliament can make Null any Article of the Treatyit would be no Treaty if this could be The Treaty is the Foundation and Constituent Head of the Parliament of  Britain  and gives it a Being and therefore is so far Superiour in it's Power as not to be Destroyed by its own Substitute and as I have said elsewhere to breake the Treaty is to Dissolve the Constitution and very Being of the Parliament and Overthrow the Union and to think  England  will Contribute to Breaking the Treaty is too hard a Suggestion and what I care not to enter upon the Discription of here  How Preposterous is it to Judge that a Parliament should hereafter Annull and Abolish in Prejudice of a whole Kingdom  what before the very Being of that Parliament was Declar'd to be their Right and Assented to Granted and Capitulated for on both sides  'Tis true 'tis possible to be done 'tis possible that after this  England  may Raise an Army and come and Destroy  Scotland  but it must be Contrary to Faith Justice Honour Right Law and Liberty and this must in its Nature Dissolve the Constitution and return the whole Island to its Divided State  But still says an Objector we can not help our selves to take up Arms will be Treason and Rebellion c And we shall be Treated as Perjur'd Rebells  I Answer it will be Treason and Rebellion in the Letter of the Thing but not in the Meaning of the Law so the taking up Arms to Joyn the Prince of  Orange  was Treason And had King  James  Defeated that Prince and Frustrated the Revolution the Gentlemen at  Notingham  would soon have found themselves Treated as Rebells and the Consequences would have been Bloody enough  But here would be no other Ground for it than was there and should ever such an Infraction of the Treaty happen I make no Scruple to say the whole Constitution would be dissolved Authority dye and things would as before Revolve either to their Divided State or into all kinds of Confusions  'Tis unkind I confess to offer such things of a Body of Gentlemen Chosen out of the whole Island and 't would be endless to give them Answers 'tis Impossible there can be Men enough found in a Parliament to close with so open a Breach of the very Constitution upon which they themselves stood Nor is  Scotland  so Inconsiderable a Nation that  England  should offer so foully to Break with them and with so little Reason Since in the Case Proposed  there can be no pretence to use you so hardly but what must be meerly Tyrannical and an Original Violence In which they could expect no Aid from Heaven or Honest Men 'Tis a Prospect so Horrid that I cannot look into it without concern No PartyHeats can run to such a length Not the Parliament in King  Charles  the ds time  tho' Loaded with Pensions and Places  could be brought to Part with any Branch of the  English  Constitution neither can they here for it will be all one whole Settlement and a Dissolution on one side Dissolves the other of Course  I think  Scotland  can have no Security like this Treaty it is back't with the Constitution 'tis Fortified with Capitulated Reason and when ever the Flood of Parties attacks it 'twill RunBack and Drown its Contrivers  If any Man talks of proposing more than can be had it gives good ground to suggest he shall be best pleased with the denial  I would censure no body in their proposing higher Demands than are reasonable and such as in their nature must embarrass the Treaty alarm  England  and destroy the hopes of an Union but this I must say 'tis just what they are for who wish the Treaty broke off And 'tis strange Friends and Enemies should both hit on the same thing and both propose  for such vastly different reasons  the same Conditions tis to me a too visible discovery of the Weakness on one hand and the Policy on the other and that's all I shall say to it  I hope the Gentlemen concern'd here will be too wary to offer any thing too hard for an  English  Parliament to grant and this is the thing with which I shall end this Discourse To impose something on the  English  which 'tis known will not pass or which Circumstances consider'd  can not this would be to come to the Union but not with the Spirit of Union  I frankly own I see no disposition in the  Scots  Nation to do so and hope I shall not be construed to suggest it in this Case I have too much respect for the  Scots  Nation to imagine such a thingBut I must own I believe that very thing is the top of the PartyPoliticks now on foot in  England  against the  Scots  Nation and against the Union in general to bring  Scotland  if possible to insist upon something which they know  England  cannot grant and for this reason we have all their Books against the Union crowded with Queries about Guarantees Securities separate Parliaments partial and imperfect Unions and the like  I acknowledge my self convinc'd that the Union is the general Safety of  Britain  that it is the particular advantage of either Nation and if I was to be askt whether Nation have greater advantages from it I profess my self nncapable of giving a direct answer on this Head it is that I Discourse I am persuaded mutual Security mutual Improvement and mutual Prosperity attends it on both sides  But there must be also mutual Confidences and mutual Affections or 'tis impossible to Unite Jealousies Feuds and Suspicions will rob the Nations of the fruit even of the Union it self There cannot be a flux of profitable Trade an easy free and uninterrupted conjunction in Circumstances and Families a Coallition of Stocks Undertakings and Improvements is National prejudices are not remov'd  If a new Seal be made or a new Armorial Ensign for  Britain  directed I wish the Motto might be WE ARE  BRETHREN and the Text will add the rest  Gen    Let there be no strife between us  Let firm Articles compleat Establishments and full Caluses form the Union and the faster the better but let us not Treat with embarrassing Suspicions politick Jealousies and uncharitable cenforious Apprehensions of one another especially where the very Nature of things helps to make them safe and where both Nations seem to mean nothing but what is sincere  I confess when I consider this I wonder to see  some Libels  and Pamphlets appear here in which they grant a nearer Union of the Kingdoms necessary for their mutual Service and yet endeavour all along to foment Jealousies between the Nations particularly that  England  shall oppress  Scotland  after the League is Concluded and that She will not Perform the Conditions  Nay one Gentleman forgets himself so far as to tell you very positively if you agree for an Equivalent  State of the Controversy P    The  English  will not Pay you the Money and the reason he gives for it is this  'Tis Incident to the Nature of Man not to perform Bargains or Pay their Debts unless they are Compell'd to it and if not Private Men far less Societys  In  English  this is saying all Men are Born Knaves and Cheats and  when in Societys  they grow worse than they were before and that the  English  are Rogues and not to be Trusted with the Money  This is very Unkind Gentlemen and very Severe Language and were not the Government in  England  much more Moderate than your Humble Servant once found them I wonder that Gentleman is not yet Taught better  Manners if this Book be as Publick there as 'tis here  But the Principle on which these Gentlemen go is not to be Wondred at since they so plainly discover their aim to be that you should Trust any Body rather than  England  And least what I mean should be hard to guess at the same Gentleman explains it for me when having first told you  England  is not to be trusted nor can give you any Security he proceeds to tell you who can  P  speaking of  England  not making the  Scots  suitable returns and their seeking some where else he adds  This they can easily do either by publick Treaties or private Bargains with their Neighbours  HOW SIR private Bargains with Neighbours How can this be  It is incident to the Nature of Man that neither private Men far less Societies will perform their Bargains  State of the Contro p  Is not this a partiallity intolerable and can I be censur'd for saying the plain meaning of this is the  English  are Knaves and will keep no Bargain with you but the  French  are honest Fellows and you may make a Bargain with them  To carry on this rudeness farther upon  England  he explains himself  if any Man does believe that Men who have no power to answer to will compel themselves to pay a great Sum of Moneyhe has more Faith than Experience or Judgment  This is not only Scurrilous and Indecent but so contrary to Truth and Experience that I could fill this tract with precedents in the very Parliament of  England  which are the People he reproaches how they have retriv'd and supported the publick Faith and establisht the Credit of Parliaments in paying great Sums of Money which they were  under no Parliamentary obligation to Pay and which they went no farther for than to examine the justice of the Demand in general not their own particular Engagement and let any Man examine the Payment and Debentures to the Army in  Ireland  to the transport Service the deficiencies of Tallies on former Funds and above all the payment of  l  to the  Dutch  for so much advanc'd on the Expedition of the Prince of  Orange  which no Parliament was ever engaged for  These are the Men that by this Book are born Knaves will keep no Bargains pay no Debts and consequently are not fit to be trusted  I leave all honest Men to judge whether there is not reason to persuade Men to come with a spirit of Union and Confidence to a Treaty of this Nature and whether these sort of Writers do not while they pretend to object against the particulars of the Union really drive at having no Union at all  I shall descend but to one more Head of this learned Author's Discourse  having not room for it here  and that is a most wonderful new invented System of Politicks set down in his th p the last paragraph  viz  By the Constitution of Parliaments the Laws are to have their rise from the Will and Humour of the People signifyed by the Lords and Commons  This is a suggestion deserves some Mirth were not the Subject too Serious and I should be glad to see that Gentleman or some body for him shew me by what part of the Constitution he will prove such a suggestion  Then he says this humour of the People is signifyed by the Lords and Commons by which he gives the Lords and Commons a great deal of Honour that their business  is only to signify the Will and Humour of the People  I hope their Lordships know their parliamentary Dignity and the Commons their Office better than this Gentleman and so I take no notice of that but I hint it upon this score  for 'tis in it self too ridiculous to deserve any note  That the humours of the People tho not the rise of Laws ought not to be raised by any Indiscretions against the Laws and that to possess their Minds with greater Dangers and greater Apprehensions than are justly before them cannot consist with the care of their Quiet any more than with the Publick good  The third and fourth Heads  viz  Civil Government and Soveraignty remain which I cannot enter upon here this Tract having run further on than I expected if it may be to the publick Service to Treat further on the Subject they may be Spoken to by themselves when the Objections of these popular Authors against the possibility and security of a civil Coallition may meet with some Reply and perhaps there may not appear such weight in them as some People imagine  These things I humbly recomend to the  Scots  Nation to Consider of I acknowledge as a Stranger it may be Objected why I Engage in this Matter but as I have always Profest a more than Common Regard to this Nation and am not come Hither without some thought of Settling amongst them on the foot of Trade and Improvement Especially if the Union follow this Treaty So I have presum'd with all the Calmness and Respect I can to recommend Impartially not the Imaginary but the real Advantages and Securities of this Union and I should be very sory if any Person should mistake me  Nor am I affraid of being suspected here the Treatment  I have met with from Parties and Power in my Native Country I think will Secure me from the Scandal of being an Emissary to a Party I have no Interest to Pursue no Gain to make no Party to Serve I seek no Advantages from the Union other than in Common with my Native Country I Contemn the Suggestion as I Scorn the Employment of an Emissary a Spy or a Mercenary my Bussiness is known here Which tending to Trade Settlement and general Improvement I never purposed to Meddle in this Affair and I hope I have done it so as can give no offence to any  And as I take this occasion to speak of my own design of settling in this Kingdom I desire to speak one word to the Citizens of  Edinburgh  I know it is Suggested that this Union shall Prejudice this City as it shall Prevent the Concourse of your Nobility and Gentry and consequently the Trade of the City  I have observed that in all the Books Railling Pamphlets and Voluminous Arguments against the Union not one has ever yet Spoke a Word about your Trade but all allow you shall be prodigious Gainers there  Shall you then lose something of the Concourse of your Gentry here Tho I do not grant that neither Be not concern'd you will Gain it Ten fold in the concourse of Strangers Not this Authors Family only but Hundreds of Familys in  England  have their Eyes this way to Engage in your Commerce Embark their Stocks in your Trade Manufactures and Fishing Encrease your Shipping and Improve your Lands  It is Impossible but your City must Encrease the Commodiousness of your Harbour for Shipping Qualify this City only to be the Metropolis of this Kingdom in Trade as well  as the Capital for Resort and who ever lives Years here will see you Encrease in Wealth and People and in Spight of an Unhappy Situation Encrease in Buildings tooTrade will and must bring Inhabitants and  Edinburgh  and  Leith  will certainly be one City in a few Years  Trades Men must be sensible of this and 'tis plain to the Meanest Capacity a Fleet of Ships in your Road and constant Import and Export will bring another sort of Concourse to the City than Ten Parliaments and 'tis too plain to need Examination  You will then fall to Importing Naval Stores Building of Ships Exporting your own Growth and Importing Forreign Goods And how many Familys will immediately follow such Employments  The Citizens and Common People of  Edinburgh  have therefore the greatest Cause in the World to wish for this Union as the only way to Redeem them from the Poverty and Misery the present want of Trade has Reduc't them to  FINIS
